    <p> I relied mostly on Troy J Bassett's <ref target="http://www.victorianresearch.org/atcl/">At the Circulating Library</ref>

      <item>for bibliographic metadata</item>

     <item>Mostly a trial-and-error procedure</item>
     <item>I selected titles to represent each category in the four selection criteria (date, size, authorship, canonicity) equally </item>
     <item>I also tried to maximize variability in other respects (genre, subject matter, etc.)</item>
     <item>The mosaic graphic helps a lot, but doesn't show reprintCount

    <head>Dealing with data in the wild</head>
    <list>
     <item>Sometimes the HTML provided was valid, quite often it was not (sometimes not even well-formed) : the preprocessing step was essential</item>
     <item>The TEI formats found also varied quite a lot, but were easier to down-translate</item>
     <item>The biggest problem in the HTML was the lack of consistency : the same feature (e.g. page number, chapter division) might appear in many different, and sometimes mutually incompatible ways </item>
     <item>Consequently, it proved impossible to write a one-size-fits-all converter (though I came close)</item>
     <item>Of course, the texts all looked much the same when rendered, but there were many different ideas about what encoding should be used to achieve that look</item>
     <item>Moreover, different decisions about <emph>what</emph> to capture in an encoding were commonplace ...</item>

    <list>
     <item>not content with <gi>emph</gi>, some Gutenberg texts put ITALIC CONTENT INTO CAPITALS</item>
     <item>some decided to preserve highlighting of first words in a paragraph</item>
     <item>some texts had "semantic styles" aka meaningful @class values -- but they were all different</item>
     <item>chapter structure was usually not represented directly but had to be inferred from placement of headings, or special divs containing headings only</item>
     <item>footnotes and footnote references were represented in many different ways</item>
