     <head>CHAPTER I</head>
     <p>It was a rich, warm night, at the beginning of August, when a gentleman enveloped in a
      cloak, for he was in evening dress, emerged from a club-house at the top of St. James’ Street,
      and descended that celebrated eminence. He had not proceeded more than half way down the
      street when, encountering a friend, he stopped with some abruptness.</p>
     <p>“I have been looking for you everywhere,” he said.</p>
     <p>“What is it?”</p>
     <p>“We can hardly talk about it here.”</p>
     <p>“Shall we go to White’s?”</p>
     <p>“I have just left it, and, between ourselves, I would rather we should be more alone. ‘Tis
      as warm as noon. Let us cross the street and get into St. James’ Place. That is always my idea
      of solitude.”</p>
     <p>So they crossed the street, and, at the corner of St. James’ Place, met several gentlemen
      who had just come out of Brookes’ Club-house. These saluted the companions as they passed, and
      said, “Capital account from Chiswick—Lord Howard says the chief will be in Downing Street on
      Monday.”</p>
     <p>“It is of Chiswick that I am going to speak to you,” said the gentleman in the cloak,
      putting his arm in that of his companion as they walked on. “What I am about to tell you is
      known only to three persons, and is the most sacred of secrets. Nothing but our friendship
      could authorise me to impart it to you.”</p>
     <p>“I hope it is something to your advantage,” said his companion.</p>
     <p>“Nothing of that sort; it is of yourself that I am thinking. Since our political
      estrangement, I have never had a contented moment. From Christ Church, until that unhappy
      paralytic stroke, which broke up a government that had lasted fifteen years, and might have
      continued fifteen more, we seemed always to have been working together. That we should again
      unite is my dearest wish. A crisis is at hand. I want you to use it to your advantage. Know
      then, that what they were just saying about Chiswick is moonshine. His case is hopeless, and
      it has been communicated to the King.”</p>
     <p>“Hopeless!”</p>
     <p>“Rely upon it; it came direct from the Cottage to my friend.”</p>
     <p>“I thought he had a mission?” said his companion, with emotion; “and men with missions do
      not disappear till they have fulfilled them.”</p>
     <p>“But why did you think so? How often have I asked you for your grounds for such a
      conviction! There are none. The man of the age is clearly the Duke, the saviour of Europe, in
      the perfection of manhood, and with an iron constitution.”</p>
     <p>“The salvation of Europe is the affair of a past generation,” said his companion. “We want
      something else now. The salvation of England should be the subject rather of our present
      thoughts.”</p>
     <p>“England! why when were things more sound? Except the split among our own men, which will be
      now cured, there is not a cause of disquietude.”</p>
     <p>“I have much,” said his friend.</p>
     <p>“You never used to have any, Sidney. What extraordinary revelations can have been made to
      you during three months of office under a semi-Whig Ministry?”</p>
     <p>“Your taunt is fair, though it pains me. And I confess to you that when I resolved to follow
      Canning and join his new allies, I had many a twinge. I was bred in the Tory camp; the Tories
      put me in Parliament and gave me office; I lived with them and liked them; we dined and voted
      together, and together pasquinaded our opponents. And yet, after Castlereagh’s death, to whom
      like yourself I was much attached, I had great misgivings as to the position of our party, and
      the future of the country. I tried to drive them from my mind, and at last took refuge in
      Canning, who seemed just the man appointed for an age of transition.”</p>
     <p>“But a transition to what?”</p>
     <p>“Well, his foreign policy was Liberal.”</p>
     <p>“The same as the Duke’s; the same as poor dear Castlereagh’s. Nothing more unjust than the
      affected belief that there was any difference between them—a ruse of the Whigs to foster
      discord in our ranks. And as for domestic affairs, no one is stouter against Parliamentary
      Reform, while he is for the Church and no surrender, though he may make a harmless speech now
      and then, as many of us do, in favour of the Catholic claims.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we will not now pursue this old controversy, my dear Ferrars, particularly if it be
      true, as you say, that Mr. Canning now lies upon his deathbed.”</p>
     <p>“If! I tell you at this very moment it may be all over.”</p>
     <p>“I am shaken to my very centre.”</p>
     <p>“It is doubtless a great blow to you,” rejoined Mr. Ferrars, “and I wish to alleviate it.
      That is why I was looking for you. The King will, of course, send for the Duke, but I can tell
      you there will be a disposition to draw back our friends that left us, at least the younger
      ones of promise. If you are awake, there is no reason why you should not retain your
      office.”</p>
     <p>“I am not so sure the King will send for the Duke.”</p>
     <p>“It is certain.”</p>
     <p>“Well,” said his companion musingly, “it may be fancy, but I cannot resist the feeling that
      this country, and the world generally, are on the eve of a great change—and I do not think the
      Duke is the man for the epoch.”</p>
     <p>“I see no reason why there should be any great change; certainly not in this country,” said
      Mr. Ferrars. “Here we have changed everything that was required. Peel has settled the criminal
      law, and Huskisson the currency, and though I am prepared myself still further to reduce the
      duties on foreign imports, no one can deny that on this subject the Government is in advance
      of public opinion.”</p>
     <p>“The whole affair rests on too contracted a basis,” said his companion. “We are habituated
      to its exclusiveness, and, no doubt, custom in England is a power; but let some event suddenly
      occur which makes a nation feel or think, and the whole thing might vanish like a dream.”</p>
     <p>“What can happen? Such affairs as the Luddites do not occur twice in a century, and as for
      Spafields riots, they are impossible now with Peel’s new police. The country is employed and
      prosperous, and were it not so, the landed interest would always keep things straight.”</p>
     <p>“It is powerful, and has been powerful for a long time; but there are other interests
      besides the landed interest now.”</p>
     <p>“Well, there is the colonial interest, and the shipping interest,” said Mr. Ferrars, “and
      both of them thoroughly with us.”</p>
     <p>“I was not thinking of them,” said his companion. “It is the increase of population, and of
      a population not employed in the cultivation of the soil, and all the consequences of such
      circumstances that were passing over my mind.”</p>
     <p>“Don’t you be too doctrinaire, my dear Sidney; you and I are practical men. We must deal
      with the existing, the urgent; and there is nothing more pressing at this moment than the
      formation of a new government. What I want is to see you as a member of it.”</p>
     <p>“Ah!” said his companion with a sigh, “do you really think it so near as that?”</p>
     <p>“Why, what have we been talking of all this time, my dear Sidney? Clear your head of all
      doubt, and, if possible, of all regrets; we must deal with the facts, and we must deal with
      them to-morrow.”</p>
     <p>“I still think he had a mission,” said Sidney with a sigh, “if it were only to bring hope to
      a people.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not see he could have done anything more,” said Mr. Ferrars, “nor do I believe
      his government would have lasted during the session. However, I must now say good-night, for I
      must look in at the Square. Think well of what I have said, and let me hear from you as soon
      as you can.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER II</head>
     <p>Zenobia was the queen of London, of fashion, and of the Tory party. When she was not holding
      high festivals, or attending them, she was always at home to her intimates, and as she deigned
      but rarely to honour the assemblies of others with her presence, she was generally at her
      evening post to receive the initiated. To be her invited guest under such circumstances proved
      at once that you had entered the highest circle of the social Paradise.</p>
     <p>Zenobia was leaning back on a brilliant sofa, supported by many cushions, and a great
      personage, grey-headed and blue-ribboned, who was permitted to share the honours of the high
      place, was hanging on her animated and inspiring accents. An ambassador, in an armed chair
      which he had placed somewhat before her, while he listened with apparent devotion to the
      oracle, now and then interposed a remark, polished and occasionally cynical. More remote, some
      dames of high degree were surrounded by a chosen band of rank and fashion and celebrity; and
      now and then was heard a silver laugh, and now and then was breathed a gentle sigh. Servants
      glided about the suite of summer chambers, occasionally with sherbets and ices, and sometimes
      a lady entered and saluted Zenobia, and then retreated to the general group, and sometimes a
      gentleman entered, and pressed the hand of Zenobia to his lips, and then vanished into
      air.</p>
     <p>“What I want you to see,” said Zenobia, “is that reaction is the law of life, and that we
      are on the eve of a great reaction. Since Lord Castlereagh’s death we have had five years of
      revolution—nothing but change, and every change has been disastrous. Abroad we are in league
      with all the conspirators of the Continent, and if there were a general war we should not have
      an ally; at home our trade, I am told, is quite ruined, and we are deluged with foreign
      articles; while, thanks to Mr. Huskisson, the country banks, which enabled Mr. Pitt to carry
      on the war and saved England, are all broken. There was one thing, of which I thought we
      should always be proud, and that was our laws and their administration; but now our most
      sacred enactments are questioned, and people are told to call out for the reform of our courts
      of judicature, which used to be the glory of the land. This cannot last. I see, indeed, many
      signs of national disgust; people would have borne a great deal from poor Lord Liverpool—for
      they knew he was a good man, though I always thought a weak one; but when it was found that
      his boasted Liberalism only meant letting the Whigs into office—who, if they had always been
      in office, would have made us the slaves of Bonaparte—their eyes were opened. Depend upon it,
      the reaction has commenced.”</p>
     <p>“We shall have some trouble with France,” said the ambassador, “unless there is a change
      here.”</p>
     <p>“The Church is weary of the present men,” said the great personage. “No one really knows
      what they are after.”</p>
     <p>“And how can the country be governed without the Church?” exclaimed Zenobia. “If the country
      once thinks the Church is in danger, the affair will soon be finished. The King ought to be
      told what is going on.”</p>
     <p>“Nothing is going on,” said the ambassador; “but everybody is afraid of something.”</p>
     <p>“The King’s friends should impress upon him never to lose sight of the landed interest,”
      said the great personage.</p>
     <p>“How can any government go on without the support of the Church and the land?” exclaimed
      Zenobia. “It is quite unnatural.”</p>
     <p>“That is the mystery,” remarked the ambassador. “Here is a government, supported by none of
      the influences hitherto deemed indispensable, and yet it exists.”</p>
     <p>“The newspapers support it,” said the great personage, “and the Dissenters, who are trying
      to bring themselves into notice, and who are said to have some influence in the northern
      counties, and the Whigs, who are in a hole, are willing to seize the hand of the ministry to
      help them out of it; and then there is always a number of people who will support any
      government—and so the thing works.”</p>
     <p>“They have got a new name for this hybrid sentiment,” said the ambassador. “They call it
      public opinion.”</p>
     <p>“How very absurd!” said Zenobia; “a mere nickname. As if there could be any opinion but that
      of the Sovereign and the two Houses of Parliament.”</p>
     <p>“They are trying to introduce here the continental Liberalism,” said the great personage.
      “Now we know what Liberalism means on the continent. It means the abolition of property and
      religion. Those ideas would not suit this country; and I often puzzle myself to foresee how
      they will attempt to apply Liberal opinions here.”</p>
     <p>“I shall always think,” said Zenobia, “that Lord Liverpool went much too far, though I never
      said so in his time; for I always uphold my friends.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we shall see what Canning will do about the Test and Corporation Acts,” said the
      great personage. “I understand they mean to push him.”</p>
     <p>“By the by, how is he really?” said the ambassador. “What are the accounts this
      afternoon?”</p>
     <p>“Here is a gentleman who will tell us,” said Zenobia, as Mr. Ferrars entered and saluted
      her.</p>
     <p>“And what is your news from Chiswick?” she inquired.</p>
     <p>“They say at Brookes’, that he will be at Downing Street on Monday.”</p>
     <p>“I doubt it,” said Zenobia, but with an expression of disappointment.</p>
     <p>Zenobia invited Mr. Ferrars to join her immediate circle. The great personage and the
      ambassador were confidentially affable to one whom Zenobia so distinguished. Their
      conversation was in hushed tones, as become the initiated. Even Zenobia seemed subdued, and
      listened; and to listen, among her many talents, was perhaps her rarest. Mr. Ferrars was one
      of her favourites, and Zenobia liked young men who she thought would become Ministers of
      State.</p>
     <p>An Hungarian Princess who had quitted the opera early that she might look in at Zenobia’s
      was now announced. The arrival of this great lady made a stir. Zenobia embraced her, and the
      great personage with affectionate homage yielded to her instantly the place of honour, and
      then soon retreated to the laughing voices in the distance that had already more than once
      attracted and charmed his ear.</p>
     <p>“Mind; I see you to-morrow,” said Zenobia to Mr. Ferrars as he also withdrew. “I shall have
      something to tell you.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER III</head>
     <p>The father of Mr. Ferrars had the reputation of being the son of a once somewhat celebrated
      statesman, but the only patrimony he inherited from his presumed parent was a clerkship in the
      Treasury, where he found himself drudging at an early age. Nature had endowed him with
      considerable abilities, and peculiarly adapted to the scene of their display. It was difficult
      to decide which was most remarkable, his shrewdness or his capacity of labour. His quickness
      of perception and mastery of details made him in a few years an authority in the office, and a
      Secretary of the Treasury, who was quite ignorant of details, but who was a good judge of
      human character, had the sense to appoint Ferrars his private secretary. This happy preferment
      in time opened the whole official world to one not only singularly qualified for that kind of
      life, but who possessed the peculiar gifts that were then commencing to be much in demand in
      those circles. We were then entering that era of commercial and financial reform which had
      been, if not absolutely occasioned, certainly precipitated, by the revolt of our colonies.
      Knowledge of finance and acquaintance with tariffs were then rare gifts, and before five years
      of his private secretaryship had expired, Ferrars was mentioned to Mr. Pitt as the man at the
      Treasury who could do something that the great minister required. This decided his lot. Mr.
      Pitt found in Ferrars the instrument he wanted, and appreciating all his qualities placed him
      in a position which afforded them full play. The minister returned Ferrars to Parliament, for
      the Treasury then had boroughs of its own, and the new member was preferred to an important
      and laborious post. So long as Pitt and Grenville were in the ascendant, Mr. Ferrars toiled
      and flourished. He was exactly the man they liked; unwearied, vigilant, clear and cold; with a
      dash of natural sarcasm developed by a sharp and varied experience. He disappeared from the
      active world in the latter years of the Liverpool reign, when a newer generation and more
      bustling ideas successfully asserted their claims; but he retired with the solace of a
      sinecure, a pension, and a privy-councillorship. The Cabinet he had never entered, nor dared
      to hope to enter. It was the privilege of an inner circle even in our then contracted public
      life. It was the dream of Ferrars to revenge in this respect his fate in the person of his
      son, and only child. He was resolved that his offspring should enjoy all those advantages of
      education and breeding and society of which he himself had been deprived. For him was to be
      reserved a full initiation in those costly ceremonies which, under the names of Eton and
      Christ Church, in his time fascinated and dazzled mankind. His son, William Pitt Ferrars,
      realised even more than his father’s hopes. Extremely good-looking, he was gifted with a
      precocity of talent. He was the marvel of Eton and the hope of Oxford. As a boy, his Latin
      verses threw enraptured tutors into paroxysms of praise, while debating societies hailed with
      acclamation clearly another heaven-born minister. He went up to Oxford about the time that the
      examinations were reformed and rendered really efficient. This only increased his renown, for
      the name of Ferrars figured among the earliest double-firsts. Those were days when a crack
      university reputation often opened the doors of the House of Commons to a young aspirant; at
      least, after a season. But Ferrars had not to wait. His father, who watched his career with
      the passionate interest with which a Newmarket man watches the development of some gifted
      yearling, took care that all the odds should be in his favour in the race of life. An old
      colleague of the elder Mr. Ferrars, a worthy peer with many boroughs, placed a seat at the
      disposal of the youthful hero, the moment he was prepared to accept it, and he might be said
      to have left the University only to enter the House of Commons.</p>
     <p>There, if his career had not yet realised the dreams of his youthful admirers, it had at
      least been one of progress and unbroken prosperity. His first speech was successful, though
      florid, but it was on foreign affairs, which permit rhetoric, and in those days demanded at
      least one Virgilian quotation. In this latter branch of oratorical adornment Ferrars was never
      deficient. No young man of that time, and scarcely any old one, ventured to address Mr.
      Speaker without being equipped with a Latin passage. Ferrars, in this respect, was triply
      armed. Indeed, when he entered public life, full of hope and promise, though disciplined to a
      certain extent by his mathematical training, he had read very little more than some Latin
      writers, some Greek plays, and some treatises of Aristotle. These with a due course of Bampton
      Lectures and some dipping into the “Quarterly Review,” then in its prime, qualified a man in
      those days, not only for being a member of Parliament, but becoming a candidate for the
      responsibility of statesmanship. Ferrars made his way; for two years he was occasionally asked
      by the minister to speak, and then Lord Castlereagh, who liked young men, made him a Lord of
      the Treasury. He was Under-Secretary of State, and “very rising,” when the death of Lord
      Liverpool brought about the severance of the Tory party, and Mr. Ferrars, mainly under the
      advice of zealots, resigned his office when Mr. Canning was appointed Minister, and cast in
      his lot with the great destiny of the Duke of Wellington.</p>
     <p>The elder Ferrars had the reputation of being wealthy. It was supposed that he had enjoyed
      opportunities of making money, and had availed himself of them, but this was not true. Though
      a cynic, and with little respect for his fellow-creatures, Ferrars had a pride in official
      purity, and when the Government was charged with venality and corruption, he would observe,
      with a dry chuckle, that he had seen a great deal of life, and that for his part he would not
      much trust any man out of Downing Street. He had been unable to resist the temptation of
      connecting his life with that of an individual of birth and rank; and in a weak moment,
      perhaps his only one, he had given his son a stepmother in a still good-looking and very
      expensive Viscountess-Dowager.</p>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars was anxious that his son should make a great alliance, but he was so distracted
      between prudential considerations and his desire that in the veins of his grand-children there
      should flow blood of undoubted nobility, that he could never bring to his purpose that clear
      and concentrated will which was one of the causes of his success in life; and, in the midst of
      his perplexities, his son unexpectedly settled the question himself. Though naturally cold and
      calculating, William Ferrars, like most of us, had a vein of romance in his being, and it
      asserted itself. There was a Miss Carey, who suddenly became the beauty of the season. She was
      an orphan, and reputed to be no inconsiderable heiress, and was introduced to the world by an
      aunt who was a duchess, and who meant that her niece should be the same. Everybody talked
      about them, and they went everywhere—among other places to the House of Commons, where Miss
      Carey, spying the senators from the old ventilator in the ceiling of St. Stephen’s Chapel,
      dropped in her excitement her opera-glass, which fell at the feet of Mr. Under-Secretary
      Ferrars. He hastened to restore it to its beautiful owner, whom he found accompanied by
      several of his friends, and he was not only thanked, but invited to remain with them; and the
      next day he called, and he called very often afterwards, and many other things happened, and
      at the end of July the beauty of the season was married not to a Duke, but to a rising man,
      who Zenobia, who at first disapproved of the match—for Zenobia never liked her male friends to
      marry—was sure would one day be Prime Minister of England.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ferrars was of the same opinion as Zenobia, for she was ambitious, and the dream was
      captivating. And Mrs. Ferrars soon gained Zenobia’s good graces, for she had many charms, and,
      though haughty to the multitude, was a first-rate flatterer. Zenobia liked flattery, and
      always said she did. Mr. Under-Secretary Ferrars took a mansion in Hill Street, and furnished
      it with befitting splendour. His dinners were celebrated, and Mrs. Ferrars gave suppers after
      the opera. The equipages of Mrs. Ferrars were distinguished, and they had a large retinue of
      servants. They had only two children, and they were twins, a brother and a sister, who were
      brought up like the children of princes. Partly for them, and partly because a minister should
      have a Tusculum, the Ferrars soon engaged a magnificent villa at Wimbledon, which had the
      advantage of admirable stables, convenient, as Mrs. Ferrars was fond of horses, and liked the
      children too, with their fancy ponies, to be early accustomed to riding. All this occasioned
      expenditure, but old Mr. Ferrars made his son a liberal allowance, and young Mrs. Ferrars was
      an heiress, or the world thought so, which is nearly the same, and then, too, young Mr.
      Ferrars was a rising man, in office, and who would always be in office for the rest of his
      life; at least, Zenobia said so, because he was on the right side and the Whigs were nowhere,
      and never would be anywhere, which was quite right, as they had wished to make us the slaves
      of Bonaparte.</p>
     <p>When the King, after much hesitation, sent for Mr. Canning, on the resignation of Lord
      Liverpool, the Zenobian theory seemed a little at fault, and William Ferrars absolutely out of
      office had more than one misgiving; but after some months of doubt and anxiety, it seemed
      after all the great lady was right. The unexpected disappearance of Mr. Canning from the
      scene, followed by the transient and embarrassed phantom of Lord Goderich, seemed to indicate
      an inexorable destiny that England should be ruled by the most eminent men of the age, and the
      most illustrious of her citizens. William Ferrars, under the inspiration of Zenobia, had
      thrown in his fortunes with the Duke, and after nine months of disquietude found his due
      reward. In the January that succeeded the August conversation in St. James’ Street with Sidney
      Wilton, William Ferrars was sworn of the Privy Council, and held high office, on the verge of
      the Cabinet.</p>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars had a dinner party in Hill Street on the day he had returned from Windsor with
      the seals of his new office. The catastrophe of the Goderich Cabinet, almost on the eve of the
      meeting of Parliament, had been so sudden, that, not anticipating such a state of affairs,
      Ferrars, among his other guests, had invited Sidney Wilton. He was rather regretting this
      when, as his carriage stopped at his own door, he observed that very gentleman on his
      threshold.</p>
     <p>Wilton greeted him warmly, and congratulated him on his promotion. “I do so at once,” he
      added, “because I shall not have the opportunity this evening. I was calling here in the hope
      of seeing Mrs. Ferrars, and asking her to excuse me from being your guest to-day.”</p>
     <p>“Well, it is rather awkward,” said Ferrars, “but I could have no idea of this when you were
      so kind as to say you would come.”</p>
     <p>“Oh, nothing of that sort,” said Sidney. “I am out and you are in, and I hope you may be in
      for a long, long time. I dare say it may be so, and the Duke is the man of the age, as you
      always said he was. I hope your being in office is not to deprive me of your pleasant dinners;
      it would be too bad to lose my place both at Whitehall and in Hill Street.”</p>
     <p>“I trust that will never happen, my dear fellow; but to-day I thought it might be
      embarrassing.”</p>
     <p>“Not at all; I could endure without wincing even the triumphant glances of Zenobia. The fact
      is, I have some business of the most pressing nature which has suddenly arisen, and which
      demands my immediate attention.”</p>
     <p>Ferrars expressed his regret, though in fact he was greatly relieved, and they parted.</p>
     <p>Zenobia did dine with the William Ferrars to-day, and her handsome husband came with her, a
      knight of the garter, and just appointed to a high office in the household by the new
      government. Even the excitement of the hour did not disturb his indigenous repose. It was a
      dignified serenity, quite natural, and quite compatible with easy and even cordial manners,
      and an address always considerate even when not sympathetic. He was not a loud or a long
      talker, but his terse remarks were full of taste and a just appreciation of things. If they
      were sometimes trenchant, the blade was of fine temper. Old Mr. Ferrars was there and the
      Viscountess Edgware. His hair had become quite silvered, and his cheek rosy as a December
      apple. His hazel eyes twinkled with satisfaction as he remembered the family had now produced
      two privy councillors. Lord Pomeroy was there, the great lord who had returned William Ferrars
      to Parliament, a little man, quite, shy, rather insignificant in appearance, but who observed
      everybody and everything; a conscientious man, who was always doing good, in silence and
      secrecy, and denounced as a boroughmonger, had never sold a seat in his life, and was always
      looking out for able men of character to introduce them to public affairs. It was not a formal
      party, but had grown up in great degree out of the circumstances of the moment. There were
      more men than women, and all men in office or devoted supporters of the new ministry.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ferrars, without being a regular beauty, had a voluptuous face and form. Her complexion
      was brilliant, with large and long-lashed eyes of blue. Her mouth was certainly too large, but
      the pouting richness of her lips and the splendour of her teeth baffled criticism. She was a
      woman who was always gorgeously or fantastically attired.</p>
     <p>“I never can understand,” would sometimes observe Zenobia’s husband to his brilliant spouse,
      “how affairs are carried on in this world. Now we have, my dear, fifty thousand per annum; and
      I do not see how Ferrars can have much more than five; and yet he lives much as we do, perhaps
      better. I know Gibson showed me a horse last week that I very much wanted, but I would not
      give him two hundred guineas for it. I called there to-day to look after it again, for it
      would have suited me exactly, but I was told I was too late, and it was sold to Mrs.
      Ferrars.”</p>
     <p>“My dear, you know I do not understand money matters,” Zenobia said in reply. “I never
      could; but you should remember that old Ferrars must be very rich, and that William Ferrars is
      the most rising man of the day, and is sure to be in the Cabinet before he is forty.”</p>
     <p>Everybody had an appetite for dinner to-day, and the dinner was worthy of the appetites.
      Zenobia’s husband declared to himself that he never dined so well, though he gave his
       <hi>chef</hi> 500 pounds a year, and old Lord Pomeroy, who had not yet admitted French wines
      to his own table, seemed quite abashed with the number of his wine-glasses and their various
      colours, and, as he tasted one succulent dish after another, felt a proud satisfaction in
      having introduced to public life so distinguished a man as William Ferrars.</p>
     <p>With the dessert, not without some ceremony, were introduced the two most remarkable guests
      of the entertainment, and these were the twins; children of singular beauty, and dressed, if
      possible, more fancifully and brilliantly than their mamma. They resembled each other, and had
      the same brilliant complexion, rich chestnut hair, delicately arched brows, and dark blue
      eyes. Though only eight years of age, a most unchildlike self-possession distinguished them.
      The expression of their countenances was haughty, disdainful, and supercilious. Their
      beautiful features seemed quite unimpassioned, and they moved as if they expected everything
      to yield to them. The girl, whose long ringlets were braided with pearls, was ushered to a
      seat next to her father, and, like her brother, who was placed by Mrs. Ferrars, was soon
      engaged in negligently tasting delicacies, while she seemed apparently unconscious of any one
      being present, except when she replied to those who addressed her with a stare and a haughty
      monosyllable. The boy, in a black velvet jacket with large Spanish buttons of silver filagree,
      a shirt of lace, and a waistcoat of white satin, replied with reserve, but some condescension,
      to the good-natured but half-humorous inquiries of the husband of Zenobia.</p>
     <p>“And when do you go to school?” asked his lordship in a kind voice and with a laughing
      eye.</p>
     <p>“I shall go to Eton in two years,” replied the child without the slightest emotion, and not
      withdrawing his attention from the grapes he was tasting, or even looking at his inquirer,
      “and then I shall go to Christ Church, and then I shall go into Parliament.”</p>
     <p>“Myra,” said an intimate of the family, a handsome private secretary of Mr. Ferrars, to the
      daughter of the house, as he supplied her plate with some choicest delicacies, “I hope you
      have not forgotten your engagement to me which you made at Wimbledon two years ago?”</p>
     <p>“What engagement?” she haughtily inquired.</p>
     <p>“To marry me.”</p>
     <p>“I should not think of marrying any one who was not in the House of Lords,” she replied, and
      she shot at him a glance of contempt.</p>
     <p>The ladies rose. As they were ascending the stairs, one of them said to Mrs. Ferrars, “Your
      son’s name is very pretty, but it is very uncommon, is it not?”</p>
     <p>“‘Tis a family name. The first Carey who bore it was a courtier of Charles the First, and we
      have never since been without it. William wanted our boy to be christened Pomeroy but I was
      always resolved, if I ever had a son, that he should be named ENDYMION.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
     <p>About the time that the ladies rose from the dinner-table in Hill Street, Mr. Sidney Wilton
      entered the hall of the Clarendon Hotel, and murmured an inquiry of the porter. Whereupon a
      bell was rung, and soon a foreign servant appeared, and bowing, invited Mr. Wilton to ascend
      the staircase and follow him. Mr. Wilton was ushered through an ante-chamber into a room of
      some importance, lofty and decorated, and obviously adapted for distinguished guests. On a
      principal table a desk was open and many papers strewn about. Apparently some person had only
      recently been writing there. There were in the room several musical instruments; the piano was
      open, there was a harp and a guitar. The room was rather dimly lighted, but cheerful from the
      steady blaze of the fire, before which Mr. Wilton stood, not long alone, for an opposite door
      opened, and a lady advanced leading with her left hand a youth of interesting mien, and about
      twelve years of age. The lady was fair and singularly thin. It seemed that her delicate hand
      must really be transparent. Her cheek was sunk, but the expression of her large brown eyes was
      inexpressibly pleasing. She wore her own hair, once the most celebrated in Europe, and still
      uncovered. Though the prodigal richness of the tresses had disappeared, the arrangement was
      still striking from its grace. That rare quality pervaded the being of this lady, and it was
      impossible not to be struck with her carriage as she advanced to greet her guest; free from
      all affectation and yet full of movement and gestures, which might have been the study of
      painters.</p>
     <p>“Ah!” she exclaimed as she gave him her hand, which he pressed to his lips, “you are ever
      faithful.”</p>
     <p>Seating themselves, she continued, “You have not seen my boy since he sate upon your knee.
      Florestan, salute Mr. Wilton, your mother’s most cherished friend.”</p>
     <p>“This is a sudden arrival,” said Mr. Wilton.</p>
     <p>“Well, they would not let us rest,” said the lady. “Our only refuge was Switzerland, but I
      cannot breathe among the mountains, and so, after a while, we stole to an obscure corner of
      the south, and for a time we were tranquil. But soon the old story: representations,
      remonstrances, warnings, and threats, appeals to Vienna, and lectures from Prince Metternich,
      not the less impressive because they were courteous, and even gallant.”</p>
     <p>“And had nothing occurred to give a colour to such complaints? Or was it sheer
      persecution?”</p>
     <p>“Well, you know,” replied the lady, “we wished to remain quiet and obscure; but where the
      lad is, they will find him out. It often astonishes me. I believe if we were in the centre of
      a forest in some Indian isle, with no companions but monkeys and elephants, a secret agent
      would appear—some devoted victim of our family, prepared to restore our fortunes and renovate
      his own. I speak the truth to you always. I have never countenanced these people; I have never
      encouraged them; but it is impossible rudely to reject the sympathy of those who, after all,
      are your fellow-sufferers, and some of who have given proof of even disinterested devotion.
      For my own part, I have never faltered in my faith, that Florestan would some day sit on the
      throne of his father, dark as appears to be our life; but I have never much believed that the
      great result could be occasioned or precipitated by intrigues, but rather by events more
      powerful than man, and led on by that fatality in which his father believed.”</p>
     <p>“And now you think of remaining here?” said Mr. Wilton.</p>
     <p>“No,” said the lady, “that I cannot do. I love everything in this country except its climate
      and, perhaps, its hotels. I think of trying the south of Spain, and fancy, if quite alone, I
      might vegetate there unnoticed. I cannot bring myself altogether to quit Europe. I am, my dear
      Sidney, intensely European. But Spain is not exactly the country I should fix upon to form
      kings and statesmen. And this is the point on which I wish to consult you. I want Florestan to
      receive an English education, and I want you to put me in the way of accomplishing this. It
      might be convenient, under such circumstances, that he should not obtrude his birth—perhaps,
      that it should be concealed. He has many honourable names besides the one which indicates the
      state to which he was born. But, on all these points, we want your advice.” And she seemed to
      appeal to her son, who bowed his head with a slight smile, but did not speak.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilton expressed his deep interest in her wishes, and promised to consider how they
      might best be accomplished, and then the conversation took a more general tone.</p>
     <p>“This change of government in your country,” said the lady, “so unexpected, so utterly
      unforeseen, disturbs me; in fact, it decided my hesitating movements. I cannot but believe
      that the accession of the Duke of Wellington to power must be bad, at least, for us. It is
      essentially reactionary. They are triumphing at Vienna.”</p>
     <p>“Have they cause?” said Mr. Wilton. “I am an impartial witness, for I have no post in the
      new administration; but the leading colleagues of Mr. Canning form part of it, and the conduct
      of foreign affairs remains in the same hands.”</p>
     <p>“That is consoling,” said the lady. “I wonder if Lord Dudley would see me. Perhaps not.
      Ministers do not love pretenders. I knew him when I was not a pretender,” added the lady, with
      the sweetest of smiles, “and thought him agreeable. He was witty. Ah! Sidney, those were happy
      days. I look back to the past with regret, but without remorse. One might have done more good,
      but one did some;” and she sighed.</p>
     <p>“You seemed to me,” said Sidney with emotion, “to diffuse benefit and blessings among all
      around you.”</p>
     <p>“And I read,” said the lady, a little indignant, “in some memoirs the other day, that our
      court was a corrupt and dissolute court. It was a court of pleasure, if you like; but of
      pleasure that animated and refined, and put the world in good humour, which, after all, is
      good government. The most corrupt and dissolute courts on the continent of Europe that I have
      known,” said the lady, “have been outwardly the dullest and most decorous.”</p>
     <p>“My memory of those days,” said Mr. Wilton, “is of ceaseless grace and inexhaustible
      charm.”</p>
     <p>“Well,” said the lady, “if I sinned I have at least suffered. And I hope they were only sins
      of omission. I wanted to see everybody happy, and tried to make them so. But let us talk no
      more of ourselves. The unfortunate are always egotistical. Tell me something of Mr. Wilton;
      and, above all, tell me why you are not in the new government.”</p>
     <p>“I have not been invited,” said Mr. Wilton. “There are more claimants than can be satisfied,
      and my claims are not very strong. It is scarcely a disappointment to me. I shall continue in
      public life; but, so far as political responsibility is concerned, I would rather wait. I have
      some fancies on that head, but I will not trouble you with them. My time, therefore, is at my
      command; and so,” he added smilingly, “I can attend to the education of Prince Florestan.”</p>
     <p>“Do you hear that, Florestan?” said the lady to her son; “I told you we had a friend. Thank
      Mr. Wilton.”</p>
     <p>And the young Prince bowed as before, but with a more serious expression. He, however, said
      nothing.</p>
     <p>“I see you have not forgotten your most delightful pursuit,” said Mr. Wilton, and he looked
      towards the musical instruments.</p>
     <p>“No,” said the lady; “throned or discrowned, music has ever been the charm or consolation of
      my life.”</p>
     <p>“Pleasure should follow business,” said Mr. Wilton, “and we have transacted ours. Would it
      be too bold if I asked again to hear those tones which have so often enchanted me?”</p>
     <p>“My voice has not fallen off,” said the lady, “for you know it was never first-rate. But
      they were kind enough to say it had some expression, probably because I generally sang my own
      words to my own music. I will sing you my farewell to Florestan,” she added gaily, and took up
      her guitar, and then in tones of melancholy sweetness, breaking at last into a gushing burst
      of long-controlled affection, she expressed the agony and devotion of a mother’s heart. Mr.
      Wilton was a little agitated; her son left the room. The mother turned round with a smiling
      face, and said, “The darling cannot bear to hear it, but I sing it on purpose, to prepare him
      for the inevitable.”</p>
     <p>“He is soft-hearted,” said Mr. Wilton.</p>
     <p>“He is the most affectionate of beings,” replied the mother. “Affectionate and mysterious. I
      can say no more. I ought to tell you his character. I cannot. You may say he may have none. I
      do not know. He has abilities, for he acquires knowledge with facility, and knows a great deal
      for a boy. But he never gives an opinion. He is silent and solitary. Poor darling! he has
      rarely had companions, and that may be the cause. He seems to me always to be thinking.”</p>
     <p>“Well, a public school will rouse him from his reveries,” said Mr. Wilton.</p>
     <p>“As he is away at this moment, I will say that which I should not care to say before his
      face,” said the lady. “You are about to do me a great service, not the first; and before I
      leave this, we may—we must—meet again more than once, but there is no time like the present.
      The separation between Florestan and myself may be final. It is sad to think of such things,
      but they must be thought of, for they are probable. I still look in a mirror, Sidney; I am not
      so frightened by what has occurred since we first met, to be afraid of that—but I never
      deceive myself. I do not know what may be the magical effect of the raisins of Malaga, but if
      it saves my life the grape cure will indeed achieve a miracle. Do not look gloomy. Those who
      have known real grief seldom seem sad. I have been struggling with sorrow for ten years, but I
      have got through it with music and singing, and my boy. See now—he will be a source of
      expense, and it will not do for you to be looking to a woman for supplies. Women are generous,
      but not precise in money matters. I have some excuse, for the world has treated me not very
      well. I never got my pension regularly; now I never get it at all. So much for the treaties,
      but everybody laughs at them. Here is the fortune of Florestan, and I wish it all to be spent
      on his education,” and she took a case from her bosom. “They are not the crown jewels, though.
      The memoirs I was reading the other day say I ran away with them. That is false, like most
      things said of me. But these are gems of Golconda, which I wish you to realise and expend for
      his service. They were the gift of love, and they were worn in love.”</p>
     <p>“It is unnecessary,” said Mr. Wilton, deprecating the offer by his attitude.</p>
     <p>“Hush!” said the lady. “I am still a sovereign to you, and I must be obeyed.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilton took the case of jewels, pressed it to his lips, and then placed it in the breast
      pocket of his coat. He was about to retire, when the lady added, “I must give you this copy of
      my song.”</p>
     <p>“And you will write my name on it?”</p>
     <p>“Certainly,” replied the lady, as she went to the table and wrote, “For Mr. Sidney Wilton,
      from AGRIPPINA.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER V</head>
     <p>In the meantime, power and prosperity clustered round the roof and family of Ferrars. He
      himself was in the prime of manhood, with an exalted position in the world of politics, and
      with a prospect of the highest. The Government of which he was a member was not only deemed
      strong, but eternal. The favour of the Court and the confidence of the country were alike
      lavished upon it. The government of the Duke could only be measured by his life, and his
      influence was irresistible. It was a dictatorship of patriotism. The country, long accustomed
      to a strong and undisturbed administration, and frightened by the changes and catastrophes
      which had followed the retirement of Lord Liverpool, took refuge in the powerful will and
      splendid reputation of a real hero.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ferrars was as ambitious of social distinction as her husband was of political power.
      She was a woman of taste, but of luxurious taste. She had a passion for splendour, which,
      though ever regulated by a fine perception of the fitness of things, was still costly. Though
      her mien was in general haughty, she flattered Zenobia, and consummately. Zenobia, who liked
      handsome people, even handsome women, and persons who were dressed beautifully, was quite won
      by Mrs. Ferrars, against whom at first she was inclined to be a little prejudiced. There was
      an entire alliance between them, and though Mrs. Ferrars greatly influenced and almost ruled
      Zenobia, the wife of the minister was careful always to acknowledge the Queen of Fashion as
      her suzerain.</p>
     <p>The great world then, compared with the huge society of the present period, was limited in
      its proportions, and composed of elements more refined though far less various. It consisted
      mainly of the great landed aristocracy, who had quite absorbed the nabobs of India, and had
      nearly appropriated the huge West Indian fortunes. Occasionally, an eminent banker or merchant
      invested a large portion of his accumulations in land, and in the purchase of parliamentary
      influence, and was in time duly admitted into the sanctuary. But those vast and successful
      invasions of society by new classes which have since occurred, though impending, had not yet
      commenced. The manufacturers, the railway kings, the colossal contractors, the discoverers of
      nuggets, had not yet found their place in society and the senate. There were then, perhaps,
      more great houses open than at the present day, but there were very few little ones. The
      necessity of providing regular occasions for the assembling of the miscellaneous world of
      fashion led to the institution of Almack’s, which died out in the advent of the new system of
      society, and in the fierce competition of its inexhaustible private entertainments.</p>
     <p>The season then was brilliant and sustained, but it was not flurried. People did not go to
      various parties on the same night. They remained where they were assembled, and, not being in
      a hurry, were more agreeable than they are at the present day. Conversation was more
      cultivated; manners, though unconstrained, were more stately; and the world, being limited,
      knew itself much better. On the other hand, the sympathies of society were more contracted
      than they are at present. The pressure of population had not opened the heart of man. The
      world attended to its poor in its country parishes, and subscribed and danced for the
      Spitalfields weavers when their normal distress had overflowed, but their knowledge of the
      people did not exceed these bounds, and the people knew very little more about themselves.
      They were only half born.</p>
     <p>The darkest hour precedes the dawn, and a period of unusual stillness often, perhaps
      usually, heralds the social convulsion. At this moment the general tranquillity and even
      content were remarkable. In politics the Whigs were quite prepared to extend to the Duke the
      same provisional confidence that had been accepted by Mr. Caning, and conciliation began to be
      an accepted phrase, which meant in practice some share on their part of the good things of the
      State. The country itself required nothing. There was a general impression, indeed, that they
      had been advancing at a rather rapid rate, and that it was as well that the reins should be
      entrusted to a wary driver. Zenobia, who represented society, was enraptured that the career
      of revolution had been stayed. She still mourned over the concession of the Manchester and
      Liverpool Railway in a moment of Liberal infatuation, but flattered herself that any extension
      of the railway system might certainly be arrested, and on this head the majority of society,
      perhaps even of the country, was certainly on her side.</p>
     <p>“I have some good news for you,” said one of her young favourites as he attended her
      reception. “We have prevented this morning the lighting of Grosvenor Square by gas by a large
      majority.”</p>
     <p>“I felt confident that disgrace would never occur,” said Zenobia, triumphant. “And by a
      large majority! I wonder how Lord Pomeroy voted.”</p>
     <p>“Against us.”</p>
     <p>“How can one save this country?” exclaimed Zenobia. “I believe now the story that he has
      ordered Lady Pomeroy not to go to the Drawing Room in a sedan chair.”</p>
     <p>One bright May morning in the spring that followed the formation of the government that was
      to last for ever, Mrs. Ferrars received the world at a fanciful entertainment in the beautiful
      grounds of her Wimbledon villa. The day was genial, the scene was flushed with roses and pink
      thorns, and brilliant groups, amid bursts of music, clustered and sauntered on the green turf
      of bowery lawns. Mrs. Ferrars, on a rustic throne, with the wondrous twins in still more
      wonderful attire, distributed alternate observations of sympathetic gaiety to a Russian Grand
      Duke and to the serene heir of a German principality. And yet there was really an expression
      on her countenance of restlessness, not to say anxiety, which ill accorded with the dulcet
      tones and the wreathed smiles which charmed her august companions. Zenobia, the great Zenobia,
      had not arrived, and the hours were advancing. The Grand Duke played with the beautiful and
      haughty infants, and the German Prince inquired of Endymion whether he were destined to be one
      of His Majesty’s guards; but still Zenobia did not come, and Mrs. Ferrars could scarcely
      conceal her vexation. But there was no real occasion for it. For even at this moment, with
      avant-courier and outriders and badged postillions on her four horses of race, the lodge-gates
      were opening for the great lady, who herself appeared in the distance; and Mrs. Ferrars,
      accompanied by her distinguished guests, immediately rose and advanced to receive the Queen of
      Fashion. No one appreciated a royal presence more highly than Zenobia. It was her habit to
      impress upon her noble fellows of both sexes that there were relations of intimacy between
      herself and the royal houses of Europe, which were not shared by her class. She liked to play
      the part of a social mediator between the aristocracy and royal houses. A German Serenity was
      her delight, but a Russian Grand Duke was her embodiment of power and pomp, and sound
      principles in their most authentic and orthodox form. And yet though she addressed their
      highnesses with her usual courtly vivacity, and poured forth inquiries which seemed to
      indicate the most familiar acquaintance with the latest incidents from Schonbrunn or the
      Rhine, though she embraced her hostess, and even kissed the children, the practised eye of
      Mrs. Ferrars, whose life was a study of Zenobia, detected that her late appearance had been
      occasioned by an important cause, and, what was more, that Zenobia was anxious to communicate
      it to her. With feminine tact Mrs. Ferrars moved on with her guests until the occasion offered
      when she could present some great ladies to the princes; and then dismissing the children on
      appropriate missions, she was not surprised when Zenobia immediately exclaimed: “Thank heaven,
      we are at last alone! You must have been surprised I was so late. Well, guess what has
      happened?” and then as Mrs. Ferrars shook her head, she continued: “They are all four
      out!”</p>
     <p>“All four!”</p>
     <p>“Yes; Lord Dudley, Lord Palmerston, and Charles Grant follow Huskisson. I do not believe the
      first ever meant to go, but the Duke would not listen to his hypocritical explanations, and
      the rest have followed. I am surprised about Lord Dudley, as I know he loved his office.”</p>
     <p>“I am alarmed,” said Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Not the slightest cause for fear,” exclaimed the intrepid Zenobia. “It must have happened
      sooner or later. I am delighted at it. We shall now have a cabinet of our own. They never
      would have rested till they had brought in some Whigs, and the country hates the Whigs. No
      wonder, when we remember that if they had had their way we should have been wearing sabots at
      this time, with a French prefect probably in Holland House.”</p>
     <p>“And whom will they put in the cabinet?” inquired Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Our good friends, I hope,” said Zenobia, with an inspiring smile; “but I have heard nothing
      about that yet. I am a little sorry about Lord Dudley, as I think they have drawn him into
      their mesh; but as for the other three, especially Huskisson and Lord Palmerston, I can tell
      you the Duke has never had a quiet moment since they joined him. We shall now begin to reign.
      The only mistake was ever to have admitted them. I think now we have got rid of Liberalism for
      ever.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars did not become a cabinet minister, but this was a vexation rather than a
      disappointment, and transient. The unexpected vacancies were filled by unexpected personages.
      So great a change in the frame of the ministry, without any promotion for himself, was on the
      first impression not agreeable, but reflection and the sanguine wisdom of Zenobia soon
      convinced him that all was for the best, that the thought of such rapid preferment was
      unreasonable, and that time and the due season must inevitably bring all that he could desire,
      especially as any term to the duration of the ministry was not now to be foreseen: scarcely
      indeed possible. In short, it was shown to him that the Tory party, renovated and restored,
      had entered upon a new lease of authority, which would stamp its character on the remainder of
      the nineteenth century, as Mr. Pitt and his school had marked its earlier and memorable
      years.</p>
     <p>And yet this very reconstruction of the government necessarily led to an incident which, in
      its consequences, changed the whole character of English politics, and commenced a series of
      revolutions which has not yet closed.</p>
     <p>One of the new ministers who had been preferred to a place which Mr. Ferrars might have
      filled was an Irish gentleman, and a member for one of the most considerable counties in his
      country. He was a good speaker, and the government was deficient in debating power in the
      House of Commons; he was popular and influential.</p>
     <p>The return of a cabinet minister by a large constituency was more appreciated in the days of
      close boroughs than at present. There was a rumour that the new minister was to be opposed,
      but Zenobia laughed the rumour to scorn. As she irresistibly remarked at one of her evening
      gatherings, “Every landowner in the county is in his favour; therefore it is impossible.” The
      statistics of Zenobia were quite correct, yet the result was different from what she
      anticipated. An Irish lawyer, a professional agitator, himself a Roman Catholic and therefore
      ineligible, announced himself as a candidate in opposition to the new minister, and on the day
      of election, thirty thousand peasants, setting at defiance all the landowners of the county,
      returned O’Connell at the head of the poll, and placed among not the least memorable of
      historical events—the Clare election.</p>
     <p>This event did not, however, occur until the end of the year 1828, for the state of the law
      then prevented the writ from being moved until that time, and during the whole of that year
      the Ferrars family had pursued a course of unflagging display. Courage, expenditure, and tact
      combined, had realised almost the height of that social ambition to which Mrs. Ferrars soared.
      Even in the limited and exclusive circle which then prevailed, she began to be counted among
      the great dames. As for the twins, they seemed quite worthy of their beautiful and luxurious
      mother. Proud, wilful, and selfish, they had one redeeming quality, an intense affection for
      each other. The sister seemed to have the commanding spirit, for Endymion was calm, but if he
      were ruled by his sister, she was ever willing to be his slave, and to sacrifice every
      consideration to his caprice and his convenience.</p>
     <p>The year 1829 was eventful, but to Ferrars more agitating than anxious. When it was first
      known that the head of the cabinet, whose colleague had been defeated at Clare, was himself
      about to propose the emancipation of the Roman Catholics, there was a thrill throughout the
      country; but after a time the success of the operation was not doubted, and was anticipated as
      a fresh proof of the irresistible fortunes of the heroic statesman. There was some popular
      discontent in the country at the proposal, but it was mainly organised and stimulated by the
      Dissenters, and that section of Churchmen who most resembled them. The High Church party, the
      descendants of the old connection which had rallied round Sacheverell, had subsided into
      formalism, and shrank from any very active co-operation with their evangelical brethren.</p>
     <p>The English Church had no competent leaders among the clergy. The spirit that has animated
      and disturbed our latter times seemed quite dead, and no one anticipated its resurrection. The
      bishops had been selected from college dons, men profoundly ignorant of the condition and the
      wants of the country. To have edited a Greek play with second-rate success, or to have been
      the tutor of some considerable patrician, was the qualification then deemed desirable and
      sufficient for an office, which at this day is at least reserved for eloquence and energy. The
      social influence of the episcopal bench was nothing. A prelate was rarely seen in the saloons
      of Zenobia. It is since the depths of religious thought have been probed, and the influence of
      woman in the spread and sustenance of religious feeling has again been recognised, that
      fascinating and fashionable prelates have become favoured guests in the refined saloons of the
      mighty, and, while apparently indulging in the vanities of the hour, have re-established the
      influence which in old days guided a Matilda or the mother of Constantine.</p>
     <p>The end of the year 1829, however, brought a private event of moment to the Ferrars family.
      The elder Mr. Ferrars died. The world observed at the time how deeply affected his son was at
      this event. The relations between father and son had always been commendable, but the world
      was hardly prepared for Mr. Ferrars, junior, being so entirely overwhelmed. It would seem that
      nothing but the duties of public life could have restored him to his friends, and even these
      duties he relinquished for an unusual time. The world was curious to know the amount of his
      inheritance, but the proof of the will was unusually delayed, and public events soon occurred
      which alike consigned the will and the will-maker to oblivion.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
     <p>The Duke of Wellington applied himself to the treatment of the critical circumstances of
      1830 with that blended patience and quickness of perception to which he owed the success of so
      many campaigns. Quite conscious of the difficulties he had to encounter, he was nevertheless
      full of confidence in his ability to control them. It is probable that the paramount desire of
      the Duke in his effort to confirm his power was to rally and restore the ranks of the Tory
      party, disturbed rather than broken up by the passing of the Relief Bill. During the very heat
      of the struggle it was significantly observed that the head of the powerful family of Lowther,
      in the House of Commons, was never asked to resign his office, although he himself and his
      following voted invariably against the Government measure. The order of the day was the utmost
      courtesy to the rebels, who were treated, as some alleged, with more consideration than the
      compliant. At the same time the desire of the Whigs to connect, perhaps even to merge
      themselves with the ministerial ranks, was not neglected. A Whig had been appointed to succeed
      the eccentric and too uncompromising Wetherell in the office of attorney-general, other posts
      had been placed at their disposal, and one even, an old companion in arms of the Duke, had
      entered the cabinet. The confidence in the Duke’s star was not diminished, and under ordinary
      circumstances this balanced strategy would probably have been successful. But it was destined
      to cope with great and unexpected events.</p>
     <p>The first was the unexpected demise of the crown. The death of King George the Fourth at the
      end of the month of June, according to the then existing constitution, necessitated a
      dissolution of parliament, and so deprived the minister of that invaluable quality of time,
      necessary to soften and win back his estranged friends. Nevertheless, it is not improbable,
      that the Duke might still have succeeded, had it not been for the occurrence of the French
      insurrection of 1830, in the very heat of the preparations for the general election in
      England. The Whigs who found the Duke going to the country without that reconstruction of his
      ministry on which they had counted, saw their opportunity and seized it. The triumphant riots
      of Paris were dignified into “the three glorious days,” and the three glorious days were
      universally recognised as the triumph of civil and religious liberty. The names of Polignac
      and Wellington were adroitly connected together, and the phrase Parliamentary Reform began to
      circulate.</p>
     <p>It was Zenobia’s last reception for the season; on the morrow she was about to depart for
      her county, and canvass for her candidates. She was still undaunted, and never more inspiring.
      The excitement of the times was reflected in her manner. She addressed her arriving guests as
      they made their obeisance to her, asked for news and imparted it before she could be answered,
      declared that nothing had been more critical since ‘93, that there was only one man who was
      able to deal with the situation, and thanked Heaven that he was not only in England, but in
      her drawing-room.</p>
     <p>Ferrars, who had been dining with his patron, Lord Pomeroy, and had the satisfaction of
      feeling, that at any rate his return to the new parliament was certain, while helping himself
      to coffee could not refrain from saying in a low tone to a gentleman who was performing the
      same office, “Our Whig friends seem in high spirits, baron.”</p>
     <p>The gentleman thus addressed was Baron Sergius, a man of middle age. His countenance was
      singularly intelligent, tempered with an expression mild and winning. He had attended the
      Congress of Vienna to represent a fallen party, a difficult and ungracious task, but he had
      shown such high qualities in the fulfilment of his painful duties—so much knowledge, so much
      self-control, and so much wise and unaffected conciliation—that he had won universal respect,
      and especially with the English plenipotentiaries, so that when he visited England, which he
      did frequently, the houses of both parties were open to him, and he was as intimate with the
      Whigs as he was with the great Duke, by whom he was highly esteemed.</p>
     <p>“As we have got our coffee, let us sit down,” said the baron, and they withdrew to a settee
      against the wall.</p>
     <p>“You know I am a Liberal, and have always been a Liberal,” said the baron; “I know the value
      of civil and religious liberty, for I was born in a country where we had neither, and where we
      have since enjoyed either very fitfully. Nothing can be much drearier than the present lot of
      my country, and it is probable that these doings at Paris may help my friends a little, and
      they may again hold up their heads for a time; but I have seen too much, and am too old, to
      indulge in dreams. You are a young man and will live to see what I can only predict. The world
      is thinking of something else than civil and religious liberty. Those are phrases of the
      eighteenth century. The men who have won these ‘three glorious days’ at Paris, want neither
      civilisation nor religion. They will not be content till they have destroyed both. It is
      possible that they may be parried for a time; that the adroit wisdom of the house of Orleans,
      guided by Talleyrand, may give this movement the resemblance, and even the character, of a
      middle-class revolution. It is no such thing; the barricades were not erected by the middle
      class. I know these people; it is a fraternity, not a nation. Europe is honeycombed with their
      secret societies. They are spread all over Spain. Italy is entirely mined. I know more of the
      southern than the northern nations; but I have been assured by one who should know that the
      brotherhood are organised throughout Germany and even in Russia. I have spoken to the Duke
      about these things. He is not indifferent, or altogether incredulous, but he is so essentially
      practical that he can only deal with what he sees. I have spoken to the Whig leaders. They
      tell me that there is only one specific, and that a complete one—constitutional government;
      that with representative institutions, secret societies cannot co-exist. I may be wrong, but
      it seems to me that with these secret societies representative institutions rather will
      disappear.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
     <p>What unexpectedly took place in the southern part of England, and especially in the maritime
      counties, during the autumn of 1830, seemed rather to confirm the intimations of Baron
      Sergius. The people in the rural districts had become disaffected. Their discontent was
      generally attributed to the abuses of the Poor Law, and to the lowness of their wages. But the
      abuses of the Poor Law, though intolerable, were generally in favour of the labourer, and
      though wages in some parts were unquestionably low, it was observed that the tumultuous
      assemblies, ending frequently in riot, were held in districts where this cause did not
      prevail. The most fearful feature of the approaching anarchy was the frequent acts of
      incendiaries. The blazing homesteads baffled the feeble police and the helpless magistrates;
      and the government had reason to believe that foreign agents were actively promoting these
      mysterious crimes.</p>
     <p>Amid partial discontent and general dejection came the crash of the Wellington ministry, and
      it required all the inspiration of Zenobia to sustain William Ferrars under the trial. But she
      was undaunted and sanguine as a morning in spring. Nothing could persuade her that the Whigs
      could ever form a government, and she was quite sure that the clerks in the public offices
      alone could turn them out. When the Whig government was formed, and its terrible programme
      announced, she laughed it to scorn, and derided with inexhaustible merriment the idea of the
      House of Commons passing a Reform Bill. She held a great assembly the night that General
      Gascoyne defeated the first measure, and passed an evening of ecstasy in giving and receiving
      congratulations. The morrow brought a graver brow, but still an indomitable spirit, and
      through all these tempestuous times Zenobia never quailed, though mobs burnt the castles of
      dukes and the palaces of bishops.</p>
     <p>Serious as was the state of affairs to William Ferrars, his condition was not so desperate
      as that of some of his friends. His seat at least was safe in the new parliament that was to
      pass a Reform Bill. As for the Tories generally, they were swept off the board. Scarcely a
      constituency, in which was a popular element, was faithful to them. The counties in those days
      were the great expounders of popular principles, and whenever England was excited, which was
      rare, she spoke through her freeholders. In this instance almost every Tory knight of the
      shire lost his seat except Lord Chandos, the member for Buckinghamshire, who owed his success
      entirely to his personal popularity. “Never mind,” said Zenobia, “what does it signify? The
      Lords will throw it out.”</p>
     <p>And bravely and unceasingly she worked for this end. To assist this purpose it was necessary
      that a lengthened and powerful resistance to the measure should be made in the Commons; that
      the public mind should be impressed with its dangerous principles, and its promoters cheapened
      by the exposure of their corrupt arrangements and their inaccurate details. It must be
      confessed that these objects were resolutely kept in view, and that the Tory opposition
      evinced energy and abilities not unworthy of a great parliamentary occasion. Ferrars
      particularly distinguished himself. He rose immensely in the estimation of the House, and soon
      the public began to talk of him. His statistics about the condemned boroughs were astounding
      and unanswerable: he was the only man who seemed to know anything of the elements of the new
      ones. He was as eloquent too as exact,—sometimes as fervent as Burke, and always as accurate
      as Cocker.</p>
     <p>“I never thought it was in William Ferrars,” said a member, musingly, to a companion as they
      walked home one night; “I always thought him a good man of business, and all that sort of
      thing—but, somehow or other, I did not think this was in him.”</p>
     <p>“Well, he has a good deal at stake, and that brings it out of a fellow,” said his
      friend.</p>
     <p>It was, however, pouring water upon sand. Any substantial resistance to the measure was from
      the first out of the question. Lord Chandos accomplished the only important feat, and that was
      the enfranchisement of the farmers. This perpetual struggle, however, occasioned a vast deal
      of excitement, and the actors in it often indulged in the wild credulity of impossible
      expectations. The saloon of Zenobia was ever thronged, and she was never more confident than
      when the bill passed the Commons. She knew that the King would never give his assent to the
      bill. His Majesty had had quite enough of going down in hackney coaches to carry revolutions.
      After all, he was the son of good King George, and the court would save the country, as it had
      often done before. “But it will not come to that,” she added. “The Lords will do their
      duty.”</p>
     <p>“But Lord Waverley tells me,” said Ferrars, “that there are forty of them who were against
      the bill last year who will vote for the second reading.”</p>
     <p>“Never mind Lord Waverley and such addlebrains,” said Zenobia, with a smile of triumphant
      mystery. “So long as we have the court, the Duke, and Lord Lyndhurst on our side, we can
      afford to laugh at such conceited poltroons. His mother was my dearest friend, and I know he
      used to have fits. Look bright,” she continued; “things never were better. Before a week has
      passed these people will be nowhere.”</p>
     <p>“But how it is possible?”</p>
     <p>“Trust me.”</p>
     <p>“I always do—and yet”——</p>
     <p>“You never were nearer being a cabinet minister,” she said, with a radiant glance.</p>
     <p>And Zenobia was right. Though the government, with the aid of the waverers, carried the
      second reading of the bill, a week afterwards, on May 7, Lord Lyndhurst rallied the waverers
      again to his standard and carried his famous resolution, that the enfranchising clauses should
      precede the disenfranchisement in the great measure. Lord Grey and his colleagues resigned,
      and the King sent for Lord Lyndhurst. The bold chief baron advised His Majesty to consult the
      Duke of Wellington, and was himself the bearer of the King’s message to Apsley House. The Duke
      found the King “in great distress,” and he therefore did not hesitate in promising to
      endeavour to form a ministry.</p>
     <p>“Who was right?” said Zenobia to Mr. Ferrars. “He is so busy he could not write to you, but
      he told me to tell you to call at Apsley House at twelve to-morrow. You will be in the
      cabinet.”</p>
     <p>“I have got it at last!” said Ferrars to himself. “It is worth living for and at any peril.
      All the cares of life sink into insignificance under such circumstances. The difficulties are
      great, but their very greatness will furnish the means of their solution. The Crown cannot be
      dragged in the mud, and the Duke was born for conquest.”</p>
     <p>A day passed, and another day, and Ferrars was not again summoned. The affair seemed to hang
      fire. Zenobia was still brave, but Ferrars, who knew her thoroughly, could detect her lurking
      anxiety. Then she told him in confidence that Sir Robert made difficulties, “but there is
      nothing in it,” she added. “The Duke has provided for everything, and he means Sir Robert to
      be Premier. He could not refuse that; it would be almost an act of treason.” Two days after
      she sent for Mr. Ferrars, early in the morning, and received him in her boudoir. Her
      countenance was excited, but serious. “Don’t be alarmed,” she said; “nothing will prevent a
      government being formed, but Sir Robert has thrown us over; I never had confidence in him. It
      is most provoking, as Mr. Baring had joined us, and it was such a good name for the City. But
      the failure of one man is the opportunity of another. We want a leader in the House of
      Commons. He must be a man who can speak; of experience, who knows the House, its forms, and
      all that. There is only one man indicated. You cannot doubt about him. I told you honours
      would be tumbling on your head. You are the man; you are to have one of the highest offices in
      the cabinet, and lead the House of Commons.”</p>
     <p>“Peel declines,” said Ferrars, speaking slowly and shaking his head. “That is very
      serious.”</p>
     <p>“For himself,” said Zenobia, “not for you. It makes your fortune.”</p>
     <p>“The difficulties seem too great to contend with.”</p>
     <p>“What difficulties are there? You have got the court, and you have got the House of Lords.
      Mr. Pitt was not nearly so well off, for he had never been in office, and had at the same time
      to fight Lord North and that wicked Mr. Fox, the orator of the day, while you have only got
      Lord Althorp, who can’t order his own dinner.”</p>
     <p>“I am in amazement,” said Ferrars, and he seemed plunged in thought.</p>
     <p>“But you do not hesitate?”</p>
     <p>“No,” he said, looking up dreamily, for he had been lost in abstraction; and speaking in a
      measured and hollow voice, “I do not hesitate.” Then resuming a brisk tone he said, “This is
      not an age for hesitation; if asked, I will do the deed.”</p>
     <p>At this moment there was a tap at the door, and the groom of the chambers brought in a note
      for Mr. Ferrars, which had been forwarded from his own residence, and which requested his
      presence at Apsley House. Having read it, he gave it to Zenobia, who exclaimed with delight,
      “Do not lose a moment. I am so glad to have got rid of Sir Robert with his doubts and his
      difficulties. We want new blood.”</p>
     <p>That was a wonderful walk for William Ferrars, from St. James’ Square to Apsley House. As he
      moved along, he was testing his courage and capacity for the sharp trials that awaited him. He
      felt himself not unequal to conjectures in which he had never previously indulged even in
      imagination. His had been an ambitious, rather than a soaring spirit. He had never
      contemplated the possession of power except under the aegis of some commanding chief. Now it
      was for him to control senates and guide councils. He screwed himself up to the
      sticking-point. Desperation is sometimes as powerful an inspirer as genius.</p>
     <p>The great man was alone,—calm, easy, and courteous. He had sent for Mr. Ferrars, because
      having had one interview with him, in which his co-operation had been requested in the conduct
      of affairs, the Duke thought it was due to him to give him the earliest intimation of the
      change of circumstances. The vote of the house of Commons on the motion of Lord Ebrington had
      placed an insurmountable barrier to the formation of a government, and his Grace had
      accordingly relinquished the commission with which he had been entrusted by the King.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
     <p>Availing himself of his latch-key, Ferrars re-entered his home unnoticed. He went at once to
      his library, and locked the door of the apartment. There sitting before his desk, he buried
      his face in his hands and remained in that posture for a considerable time.</p>
     <p>They were tumultuous and awful thoughts that passed over his brain. The dreams of a life
      were dissipated, and he had to encounter the stern reality of his position—and that was Ruin.
      He was without hope and without resource. His debts were vast; his patrimony was a fable; and
      the mysterious inheritance of his wife had been tampered with. The elder Ferrars had left an
      insolvent estate; he had supported his son liberally, but latterly from his son’s own
      resources. The father had made himself the principal trustee of the son’s marriage settlement.
      His colleague, a relative of the heiress, had died, and care was taken that no one should be
      substituted in his stead. All this had been discovered by Ferrars on his father’s death, but
      ambition, and the excitement of a life of blended elation and peril, had sustained him under
      the concussion. One by one every chance had vanished: first his private means and then his
      public prospects; he had lost office, and now he was about to lose parliament. His whole
      position, so long, and carefully, and skilfully built up, seemed to dissolve and dissipate
      into insignificant fragments. And now he had to break the situation to his wife. She was to
      become the unprepared partner of the secret which had gnawed at his heart for years, during
      which to her his mien had often been smiling and always serene. Mrs. Ferrars was at home, and
      alone, in her luxurious boudoir, and he went to her at once. After years of dissimulation, now
      that all was over, Ferrars could not bear the suspense of four-and-twenty hours.</p>
     <p>It was difficult to bring her into a mood of mind capable of comprehending a tithe of what
      she had to learn; and yet the darkest part of the tale she was never to know. Mrs. Ferrars,
      though singularly intuitive, shrank from controversy, and settled everything by contradiction
      and assertion. She maintained for a long time that what her husband communicated to her could
      not be; that it was absurd and even impossible. After a while, she talked of selling her
      diamonds and reducing her equipage, sacrificing which she assumed would put everything right.
      And when she found her husband still grave and still intimating that the sacrifices must be
      beyond all this, and that they must prepare for the life and habits of another social sphere,
      she became violent, and wept and declared her wrongs; that she had been deceived and outraged
      and infamously treated.</p>
     <p>Remembering how long and with what apparent serenity in her presence he had endured his
      secret woes, and how one of the principal objects of his life had ever been to guard her even
      from a shade of solicitude, even the restrained Ferrars was affected; his countenance changed
      and his eyes became suffused. When she observed this, she suddenly threw her arms round his
      neck and with many embraces, amid sighs and tears, exclaimed, “O William! if we love each
      other, what does anything signify?”</p>
     <p>And what could anything signify under such circumstances and on such conditions? As Ferrars
      pressed his beautiful wife to his heart, he remembered only his early love, which seemed
      entirely to revive. Unconsciously to himself, too, he was greatly relieved by this burst of
      tenderness on her part, for the prospect of this interview had been most distressful to him.
      “My darling,” he said, “ours is not a case of common imprudence or misfortune. We are the
      victims of a revolution, and we must bear our lot as becomes us under such circumstances.
      Individual misfortunes are merged in the greater catastrophe of the country.”</p>
     <p>“That is the true view,” said his wife; “and, after all, the poor King of France is much
      worse off than we are. However, I cannot now buy the Duchesse of Sevres’ lace, which I had
      promised her to do. It is rather awkward. However, the best way always is to speak the truth.
      I must tell the duchess I am powerless, and that we are the victims of a revolution, like
      herself.”</p>
     <p>Then they began to talk quite cosily together over their prospects, he sitting on the sofa
      by her side and holding her hand. Mrs. Ferrars would not hear of retiring to the continent.
      “No,” she said, with all her sanguine vein returning, “you always used to say I brought you
      luck, and I will bring you luck yet. There must be a reaction. The wheel will turn and bring
      round our friends again. Do not let us then be out of the way. Your claims are immense. They
      must do something for you. They ought to give you India, and if we only set our mind upon it,
      we shall get it. Depend upon it, things are not so bad as they seem. What appear to be
      calamities are often the sources of fortune. I would much sooner that you should be
      Governor-General than a cabinet minister. That odious House of Commons is very wearisome. I am
      not sure any constitution can bear it very long. I am not sure whether I would not prefer
      being Governor-General of India even to being Prime-Minister.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER X</head>
     <p>In consequence of the registration under the Reform Act it was not possible for parliament
      to be dissolved, and an appeal made to the new constituency, until the end of the year. This
      was advantageous to Mr. Ferrars, and afforded him six months of personal security to arrange
      his affairs. Both husband and wife were proud, and were anxious to quit the world with
      dignity. All were so busy about themselves at that period, and the vicissitudes of life
      between continental revolutions and English reform so various and extensive, that it was not
      difficult to avoid the scrutiny of society. Mrs. Ferrars broke to Zenobia that, as her husband
      was no longer to be in parliament, they had resolved to retire for some time to a country
      life, though, as Mr. Ferrars had at length succeeded in impressing on his wife that their
      future income was to be counted by hundreds, rather than thousands, it was difficult for her
      to realise a rural establishment that should combine dignity and economy. Without, however,
      absolutely alleging the cause, she contrived to baffle the various propositions of this kind
      which the energetic Zenobia made to her, and while she listened with apparent interest to
      accounts of deer parks, and extensive shooting, and delightful neighbourhoods, would just
      exclaim, “Charming! but rather more, I fancy, than we require, for we mean to be very quiet
      till my girl is presented.”</p>
     <p>That young lady was now thirteen, and though her parents were careful to say nothing in her
      presence which would materially reveal their real situation, for which they intended very
      gradually to prepare her, the scrutinising powers with which nature had prodigally invested
      their daughter were not easily baffled. She asked no questions, but nothing seemed to escape
      the penetrative glance of that large dark blue eye, calm amid all the mystery, and tolerating
      rather than sharing the frequent embrace of her parents. After a while her brother came home
      from Eton, to which he was never to return. A few days before this event she became unusually
      restless, and even agitated. When he arrived, neither Mr. nor Mrs. Ferrars was at home. He
      knocked gaily at the door, a schoolboy’s knock, and was hardly in the hall when his name was
      called, and he caught the face of his sister, leaning over the balustrade of the
      landing-place. He ran upstairs with wondrous speed, and was in an instant locked in her arms.
      She kissed him and kissed him again, and when he tried to speak, she stopped his mouth with
      kisses. And then she said, “Something has happened. What it is I cannot make out, but we are
      to have no more ponies.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
     <p>At the foot of the Berkshire downs, and itself on a gentle elevation, there is an old hall
      with gable ends and lattice windows, standing in grounds which once were stately, and where
      there are yet glade-like terraces of yew trees, which give an air of dignity to a neglected
      scene. In the front of the hall huge gates of iron, highly wrought, and bearing an ancient
      date as well as the shield of a noble house, opened on a village green, round which were
      clustered the cottages of the parish with only one exception, and that was the vicarage house,
      a modern building, not without taste, and surrounded by a small but brilliant garden. The
      church was contiguous to the hall, and had been raised by the lord on a portion of his domain.
      Behind the hall and its enclosure, the country was common land but picturesque. It had once
      been a beech forest, and though the timber had been greatly cleared, the green land was still
      occasionally dotted, sometimes with groups and sometimes with single trees, while the juniper
      which here abounded, and rose to a great height, gave a rich wildness to the scene, and
      sustained its forest character.</p>
     <p>Hurstley had for many years been deserted by the family to which it belonged. Indeed, it was
      rather difficult to say to whom it did belong. A dreary fate had awaited an ancient, and, in
      its time, even not immemorable home. It had fallen into chancery, and for the last
      half-century had either been uninhabited or let to strangers. Mr. Ferrars’ lawyer was in the
      chancery suit, and knew all about it. The difficulty of finding a tenant for such a place,
      never easy, was increased by its remoteness from any railway communication, which was now
      beginning to figure as an important element in such arrangements. The Master in Chancery would
      be satisfied with a nominal rent, provided only he could obtain a family of consideration to
      hold under him. Mr. Ferrars was persuaded to go down alone to reconnoitre the place. It
      pleased him. It was aristocratic, yet singularly inexpensive. The house contained an immense
      hall, which reached the roof, and which would have become a baronial mansion, and a vast
      staircase in keeping; but the living rooms were moderate, even small, in dimensions, and not
      numerous. The land he was expected to take consisted only of a few meadows, which he could let
      if necessary, and a single labourer could manage the garden.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ferrars was so delighted with the description of the galleried hall, that she resolved
      on their taking Hurstley without even her previously visiting it. The only things she cared
      for in the country were a hall and a pony-chair.</p>
     <p>All the carriages were sold, and all the servants discharged. Two or three maid-servants and
      a man who must be found in the country, who could attend them at table, and valet alike his
      master and the pony, was the establishment which was to succeed the crowd of retainers who had
      so long lounged away their lives in the saloons of Hill Street, and the groves and gardens of
      Wimbledon.</p>
     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars and their daughter travelled down to Hurstley in a post-chaise;
      Endymion, with the servants, was sent by the stage-coach, which accomplished the journey of
      sixty miles in ten hours. Myra said little during the journey, but an expression of ineffable
      contempt and disgust seemed permanent on her countenance. Sometimes she shrugged her
      shoulders, sometimes she raised her eyebrows, and sometimes she turned up her nose. And then
      she gave a sigh; but it was a sigh not of sorrow, but of impatience. Her parents lavished
      attentions on her which she accepted without recognition, only occasionally observing that she
      wished she had gone with Endymion.</p>
     <p>It was dusk when they arrived at Hurstley, and the melancholy hour did not tend to raise
      their spirits. However, the gardener’s wife had lit a good fire of beechwood in the
      drawing-room, and threw as they entered a pannier of cones upon the logs, which crackled and
      cheerfully blazed away. Even Myra seemed interested by the novelty of the wood fire and the
      iron dogs. She remained by their side, looking abstractedly on the expiring logs, while her
      parents wandered about the house and examined or prepared the requisite arrangements. While
      they were yet absent, there was some noise and a considerable bustle in the hall. Endymion and
      his retinue had arrived. Then Myra immediately roused herself, and listened like a startled
      deer. But the moment she caught his voice, an expression of rapture suffused her countenance.
      It beamed with vivacity and delight. She rushed away, pushed through the servants and the
      luggage, embraced him and said, “We will go over the house and see our rooms together.”</p>
     <p>Wandering without a guide and making many mistakes, fortunately they soon met their parents.
      Mrs. Ferrars good-naturedly recommenced her labours of inspection, and explained all her
      plans. There was a very pretty room for Endymion, and to-morrow it was to be very comfortable.
      He was quite pleased. Then they were shown Myra’s room, but she said nothing, standing by with
      a sweet scoff, as it were, lingering on her lips, while her mother disserted on all the
      excellences of the chamber. Then they were summoned to tea. The gardener’s wife was quite a
      leading spirit, and had prepared everything; the curtains were drawn, and the room lighted; an
      urn hissed; there were piles of bread and butter and a pyramid of buttered toast. It was
      wonderful what an air of comfort had been conjured up in this dreary mansion, and it was
      impossible for the travellers, however wearied or chagrined, to be insensible to the
      convenience and cheerfulness of all around them.</p>
     <p>When the meal was over, the children sate together in whispering tattle. Mrs. Ferrars had
      left the room to see if all was ready for their hour of retirement, and Mr. Ferrars was
      walking up and down the room, absorbed in thought.</p>
     <p>“What do you think of it all, Endymion?” whispered Myra to her twin.</p>
     <p>“I rather like it,” he said.</p>
     <p>She looked at him with a glance of blended love and mockery, and then she said in his ear,
      “I feel as if we had fallen from some star.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
     <p>The morrow brought a bright autumnal morn, and every one woke, if not happy, interested.
      There was much to see and much to do. The dew was so heavy that the children were not allowed
      to quit the broad gravel walk that bounded one side of the old house, but they caught enticing
      vistas of the gleamy glades, and the abounding light and shade softened and adorned
      everything. Every sight and sound too was novel, and from the rabbit that started out of the
      grove, stared at them and then disappeared, to the jays chattering in the more distant woods,
      all was wonderment at least for a week. They saw squirrels for the first time, and for the
      first time beheld a hedgehog. Their parents were busy in the house; Mr. Ferrars unpacking and
      settling his books, and his wife arranging some few articles of ornamental furniture that had
      been saved from the London wreck, and rendering their usual room of residence as refined as
      was in her power. It is astonishing how much effect a woman of taste can produce with a pretty
      chair or two full of fancy and colour, a table clothed with a few books, some family
      miniatures, a workbag of rich material, and some toys that we never desert. “I have not much
      to work with,” said Mrs. Ferrars, with a sigh, “but I think the colouring is pretty.”</p>
     <p>On the second day after their arrival, the rector and his wife made them a visit. Mr.
      Penruddock was a naturalist, and had written the history of his parish. He had escaped being
      an Oxford don by being preferred early to this college living, but he had married the daughter
      of a don, who appreciated the grand manners of their new acquaintances, and who, when she had
      overcome their first rather awe-inspiring impression, became communicative and amused them
      much with her details respecting the little world in which they were now to live. She could
      not conceal her wonderment at the beauty of the twins, though they were no longer habited in
      those dresses which had once astonished even Mayfair.</p>
     <p>Part of the scheme of the new life was the education of the children by their parents. Mr.
      Ferrars had been a distinguished scholar, and was still a good one. He was patient and
      methodical, and deeply interested in his contemplated task. So far as disposition was
      concerned the pupil was not disappointing. Endymion was of an affectionate disposition and
      inclined to treat his father with deference. He was gentle and docile; but he did not acquire
      knowledge with facility, and was remarkably deficient in that previous information on which
      his father counted. The other pupil was of a different temperament. She learned with a glance,
      and remembered with extraordinary tenacity everything she had acquired. But she was neither
      tender nor deferential, and to induce her to study you could not depend on the affections, but
      only on her intelligence. So she was often fitful, capricious, or provoking, and her mother,
      who, though accomplished and eager, had neither the method nor the self-restraint of Mr.
      Ferrars, was often annoyed and irritable. Then there were scenes, or rather ebullitions on one
      side, for Myra was always unmoved and enraging from her total want of sensibility. Sometimes
      it became necessary to appeal to Mr. Ferrars, and her manner to her father, though devoid of
      feeling, was at least not contemptuous. Nevertheless, on the whole the scheme, as time went
      on, promised to be not unsuccessful. Endymion, though not rapidly, advanced surely, and made
      some amends for the years that had been wasted in fashionable private schools and the then
      frivolity of Eton. Myra, who, notwithstanding her early days of indulgence, had enjoyed the
      advantage of admirable governesses, was well grounded in more than one modern language, and
      she soon mastered them. And in due time, though much after the period on which we are now
      touching, she announced her desire to become acquainted with German, in those days a much
      rarer acquirement than at present. Her mother could not help her in this respect, and that was
      perhaps an additional reason for the study of this tongue, for Myra was impatient of tuition,
      and not unjustly full of self-confidence. She took also the keenest interest in the progress
      of her brother, made herself acquainted with all his lessons, and sometimes helped him in
      their achievement.</p>
     <p>Though they had absolutely no acquaintance of any kind except the rector and his family,
      life was not dull. Mr. Ferrars was always employed, for besides the education of his children,
      he had systematically resumed a habit in which he had before occasionally indulged, and that
      was political composition. He had in his lofty days been the author of more than one essay, in
      the most celebrated political publication of the Tories, which had commanded attention and
      obtained celebrity. Many a public man of high rank and reputation, and even more than one
      Prime Minister, had contributed in their time to its famous pages, but never without being
      paid. It was the organic law of this publication, that gratuitous contributions should never
      be admitted. And in this principle there was as much wisdom as pride. Celebrated statesmen
      would point with complacency to the snuff-box or the picture which had been purchased by their
      literary labour, and there was more than one bracelet on the arm of Mrs. Ferrars, and more
      than one genet in her stable, which had been the reward of a profound or a slashing article by
      William.</p>
     <p>What had been the occasional diversion of political life was now to be the source of regular
      income. Though living in profound solitude, Ferrars had a vast sum of political experience to
      draw upon, and though his training and general intelligence were in reality too exclusive and
      academical for the stirring age which had now opened, and on which he had unhappily fallen,
      they nevertheless suited the audience to which they were particularly addressed. His
      Corinthian style, in which the Maenad of Mr. Burke was habited in the last mode of Almack’s,
      his sarcasms against the illiterate and his invectives against the low, his descriptions of
      the country life of the aristocracy contrasted with the horrors of the guillotine, his
      Horatian allusions and his Virgilian passages, combined to produce a whole which equally
      fascinated and alarmed his readers.</p>
     <p>These contributions occasioned some communications with the editor or publisher of the
      Review, which were not without interest. Parcels came down by the coach, enclosing not merely
      proof sheets, but frequently new books—the pamphlet of the hour before it was published, or a
      volume of discoveries in unknown lands. It was a link to the world they had quitted without
      any painful associations. Otherwise their communications with the outside world were slight
      and rare. It is difficult for us, who live in an age of railroads, telegraphs, penny posts and
      penny newspapers, to realise how uneventful, how limited in thought and feeling, as well as in
      incident, was the life of an English family of retired habits and limited means, only forty
      years ago. The whole world seemed to be morally, as well as materially, “adscripti
      glebae.”</p>
     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars did not wish to move, but had they so wished, it would have been under
      any circumstances for them a laborious and costly affair. The only newspaper they saw was the
      “Evening Mail,” which arrived three times a week, and was the “Times” newspaper with all its
      contents except its advertisements. As the “Times” newspaper had the credit of mainly
      contributing to the passing of Lord Grey’s Reform Bill, and was then whispered to enjoy the
      incredible sale of twelve thousand copies daily, Mr. Ferrars assumed that in its columns he
      would trace the most authentic intimations of coming events. The cost of postage was then so
      heavy, that domestic correspondence was necessarily very restricted. But this vexatious
      limitation hardly applied to the Ferrars. They had never paid postage. They were born and had
      always lived in the franking world, and although Mr. Ferrars had now himself lost the
      privilege, both official and parliamentary, still all their correspondents were frankers, and
      they addressed their replies without compunction to those who were free. Nevertheless, it was
      astonishing how little in their new life they cared to avail themselves of this
      correspondence. At first Zenobia wrote every week, almost every day, to Mrs. Ferrars, but
      after a time Mrs. Ferrars, though at first pleased by the attention, felt its recognition a
      burthen. Then Zenobia, who at length, for the first time in her life, had taken a gloomy view
      of affairs, relapsed into a long silence, and in fact had nearly forgotten the Ferrars, for as
      she herself used to say, “How can one recollect people whom one never meets?”</p>
     <p>In the meantime, for we have been a little anticipating in our last remarks, the family at
      Hurstley were much pleased with the country they now inhabited. They made excursions of
      discovery into the interior of their world, Mrs. Ferrars and Myra in the pony-chair, her
      husband and Endymion walking by their side, and Endymion sometimes taking his sister’s seat
      against his wish, but in deference to her irresistible will. Even Myra could hardly be
      insensible to the sylvan wildness of the old chase, and the romantic villages in the wooded
      clefts of the downs. As for Endymion he was delighted, and it seemed to him, perhaps he
      unconsciously felt it, that this larger and more frequent experience of nature was a
      compensation for much which they had lost.</p>
     <p>After a time, when they had become a little acquainted with simple neighbourhood, and the
      first impression of wildness and novelty had worn out, the twins were permitted to walk
      together alone, though within certain limits. The village and its vicinity was quite free, but
      they were not permitted to enter the woods, and not to wander on the chase out of sight of the
      mansion. These walks alone with Endymion were the greatest pleasure of his sister. She
      delighted to make him tell her of his life at Eton, and if she ever sighed it was when she
      lamented that his residence there had been so short. Then they found an inexhaustible fund of
      interest and sympathy in the past. They wondered if they ever should have ponies again. “I
      think not,” said Myra, “and yet how merry to scamper together over this chase!”</p>
     <p>“But they would not let us go,” said Endymion, “without a groom.”</p>
     <p>“A groom!” exclaimed Myra, with an elfish laugh; “I believe, if the truth were really known,
      we ought to be making our own beds and washing our own dinner plates.”</p>
     <p>“And are you sorry, Myra, for all that has happened?” asked Endymion.</p>
     <p>“I hardly know what has happened. They keep it very close. But I am too astonished to be
      sorry. Besides, what is the use of whimpering?”</p>
     <p>“I cried very much one day,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Ah, you are soft, dear darling. I never cried in my life, except once with rage.”</p>
     <p>At Christmas a new character appeared on the stage, the rector’s son, Nigel. He had
      completed a year with a private tutor, and was on the eve of commencing his first term at
      Oxford, being eighteen, nearly five years older than the twins. He was tall, with a
      countenance of remarkable intelligence and power, though still softened by the innocence and
      bloom of boyhood. He was destined to be a clergyman. The twins were often thrown into his
      society, for though too old to be their mere companion, his presence was an excuse for Mrs.
      Penruddock more frequently joining them in their strolls, and under her auspices their
      wanderings had no limit, except the shortness of the days; but they found some compensation
      for this in their frequent visits to the rectory, which was a cheerful and agreeable home,
      full of stuffed birds, and dried plants, and marvellous fishes, and other innocent trophies
      and triumphs over nature.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
     <p>The tenant of the Manor Farm was a good specimen of his class; a thorough Saxon, ruddy and
      bright visaged, with an athletic though rather bulky frame, hardened by exposure to the
      seasons and constant exercise. Although he was the tenant of several hundred acres, he had an
      eye to the main chance in little things, which is a characteristic of farmers, but he was
      good-natured and obliging, and while he foraged their pony, furnished their woodyard with logs
      and faggots, and supplied them from his dairy, he gratuitously performed for the family at the
      hall many other offices which tended to their comfort and convenience, but which cost him
      nothing.</p>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars liked to have a chat every now and then with Farmer Thornberry, who had a shrewd
      and idiomatic style of expressing his limited, but in its way complete, experience of men and
      things, which was amusing and interesting to a man of the world whose knowledge of rural life
      was mainly derived from grand shooting parties at great houses.</p>
     <p>The pride and torment of Farmer Thornberry’s life was his only child, Job.</p>
     <p>“I gave him the best of educations,” said the farmer; “he had a much better chance than I
      had myself, for I do not pretend to be a scholar, and never was; and yet I cannot make head or
      tail of him. I wish you would speak to him some day, sir. He goes against the land, and yet we
      have been on it for three generations, and have nothing to complain of; and he is a good
      farmer, too, is Job, none better; a little too fond of experimenting, but then he is young.
      But I am very much afraid he will leave me. I think it is this new thing the big-wigs have set
      up in London that has put him wrong, for he is always reading their papers.”</p>
     <p>“And what is that?” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Well, they call themselves the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge, and Lord Brougham is
      at the head of it.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! he is a dangerous man,” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Do you know, I think he is,” said Farmer Thornberry, very seriously, “and by this token, he
      says a knowledge of chemistry is necessary for the cultivation of the soil.”</p>
     <p>“Brougham is a man who would say anything,” said Mr. Ferrars, “and of one thing you may be
      quite certain, that there is no subject which Lord Brougham knows thoroughly. I have proved
      that, and if you ever have time some winter evening to read something on the matter, I will
      lend you a number of the ‘Quarterly Review,’ which might interest you.”</p>
     <p>“I wish you would lend it to Job,” said the farmer.</p>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars found Job not quite so manageable in controversy as his father. His views were
      peculiar, and his conclusions certain. He had more than a smattering too of political economy,
      a kind of knowledge which Mr. Ferrars viewed with suspicion; for though he had himself been
      looked upon as enlightened in this respect in the last years of Lord Liverpool, when Lord
      Wallace and Mr. Huskisson were astonishing the world, he had relapsed, after the schism of the
      Tory party, into orthodoxy, and was satisfied that the tenets of the economists were mere
      theories, or could only be reduced into practice by revolution.</p>
     <p>“But it is a pleasant life, that of a farmer,” said Mr. Ferrars to Job.</p>
     <p>“Yes, but life should be something more than pleasant,” said Job, who always looked
      discontented; “an ox in a pasture has a pleasant life.”</p>
     <p>“Well, and why should it not be a profitable one, too?” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“I do not see my way to that,” said Job moodily; “there is not much to be got out of the
      land at any time, and still less on the terms we hold it.”</p>
     <p>“But you are not high-rented!”</p>
     <p>“Oh, rent is nothing, if everything else were right, but nothing is right,” said Job. “In
      the first place, a farmer is the only trader who has no security for his capital.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! you want a lease?”</p>
     <p>“I should be very sorry to have a lease like any that I have seen,” replied Job. “We had one
      once in our family, and we keep it as a curiosity. It is ten skins long, and more tyrannical
      nonsense was never engrossed by man.”</p>
     <p>“But your family, I believe, has been on this estate for generations now,” said Ferrars,
      “and they have done well.”</p>
     <p>“They have done about as well as their stock. They have existed,” said Job; “nothing
      more.”</p>
     <p>“Your father always gives me quite the idea of a prosperous man,” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Whether he be or not I am sure I cannot say,” said Job; “for as neither he nor any of his
      predecessors ever kept any accounts, it is rather difficult to ascertain their exact
      condition. So long as he has money enough in his pocket to pay his labourers and buy a little
      stock, my father, like every British farmer, is content. The fact is, he is a serf as much as
      his men, and until we get rid of feudalism he will remain so.”</p>
     <p>“These are strong opinions,” said Mr. Ferrars, drawing himself up and looking a little
      cold.</p>
     <p>“Yes, but they will make their way,” said Job. “So far as I myself am concerned, I do not
      much care what happens to the land, for I do not mean to remain on it; but I care for the
      country. For the sake of the country I should like to see the whole thing upset.”</p>
     <p>“What thing?” asked Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Feudalism,” said Job. “I should like to see this estate managed on the same principles as
      they do their great establishments in the north of England. Instead of feudalism, I would
      substitute the commercial principle. I would have long leases without covenants; no useless
      timber, and no game.”</p>
     <p>“Why, you would destroy the country,” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“We owe everything to the large towns,” said Job.</p>
     <p>“The people in the large towns are miserable,” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“They cannot be more miserable than the people in the country,” said Job.</p>
     <p>“Their wretchedness is notorious,” said Mr. Ferrars. “Look at their riots.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we had Swing in the country only two or three years ago.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars looked sad. The reminiscence was too near and too fatal. After a pause he said
      with an air of decision, and as if imparting a state secret, “If it were not for the
      agricultural districts, the King’s army could not be recruited.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that would not break my heart,” said Job.</p>
     <p>“Why, my good fellow, you are a Radical!”</p>
     <p>“They may call me what they like,” said Job; “but it will not alter matters. However, I am
      going among the Radicals soon, and then I shall know what they are.”</p>
     <p>“And can you leave your truly respectable parent?” said Mr. Ferrars rather solemnly, for he
      remembered his promise to Farmer Thornberry to speak seriously to his son.</p>
     <p>“Oh! my respectable parent will do very well without me, sir. Only let him be able to drive
      into Bamford on market day, and get two or three linendrapers to take their hats off to him,
      and he will be happy enough, and always ready to die for our glorious Constitution.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
     <p>Eighteen hundred and thirty-two, the darkest and most distressing year in the life of Mr.
      Ferrars, closed in comparative calm and apparent content. He was himself greatly altered, both
      in manner and appearance. He was kind and gentle, but he was silent and rarely smiled. His
      hair was grizzled, and he began to stoop. But he was always employed, and was interested in
      his labours.</p>
     <p>His sanguine wife bore up against their misfortunes with far more animation. She was at
      first amused with her new life, and when she was accustomed to it, she found a never-failing
      resource in her conviction of a coming reaction. Mrs. Ferrars possessed most feminine
      qualities, and many of them in excess. She could not reason, but her intuition was remarkable.
      She was of opinion that “these people never could go on,” and that they must necessarily be
      succeeded by William and his friends. In vain her husband, when she pressed her views and
      convictions on him, would shake his head over the unprecedented majority of the government,
      and sigh while he acknowledged that the Tories absolutely did not now command one fifth of the
      House of Commons; his shakes and sighs were equally disregarded by her, and she persisted in
      her dreams of riding upon elephants.</p>
     <p>After all Mrs. Ferrars was right. There is nothing more remarkable in political history than
      the sudden break-up of the Whig party after their successful revolution of 1832. It is one of
      the most striking instances on record of all the elements of political power being useless
      without a commanding individual will. During the second year of their exile in the Berkshire
      hills, affairs looked so black that it seemed no change could occur except further and more
      calamitous revolution. Zenobia went to Vienna that she might breathe the atmosphere of law and
      order, and hinted to Mrs. Ferrars that probably she should never return—at least not until
      Parliament met, when she trusted the House of Lords, if they were not abolished in the
      interval, would save the country. And yet at the commencement of the following year an old
      colleague of Mr. Ferrars apprised him, in the darkest and deepest confidence, that “there was
      a screw loose,” and he must “look out for squalls.”</p>
     <p>In the meantime Mr. Ferrars increased and established his claims on his party, if they ever
      did rally, by his masterly articles in their great Review, which circumstances favoured and
      which kept up that increasing feeling of terror and despair which then was deemed necessary
      for the advancement of Conservative opinions.</p>
     <p>At home a year or more had elapsed without change. The occasional appearance of Nigel
      Penruddock was the only event. It was to all a pleasing, and to some of the family a deeply
      interesting one. Nigel, though a student and devoted to the holy profession for which he was
      destined, was also a sportsman. His Christianity was muscular, and Endymion, to whom he had
      taken a fancy, became the companion of his pastimes. All the shooting of the estate was at
      Nigel’s command, but as there were no keepers, it was of course very rough work. Still it was
      a novel and animating life for Endymion; and though the sport was slight, the pursuit was
      keen. Then Nigel was a great fisherman, and here their efforts had a surer return, for they
      dwelt in a land of trout streams, and in their vicinity was a not inconsiderable river. It was
      an adventure of delight to pursue some of these streams to their source, throwing, as they
      rambled on, the fly in the rippling waters. Myra, too, took some pleasure in these fishing
      expeditions, carrying their luncheon and a German book in her wallet, and sitting quietly on
      the bank for hours, when they had fixed upon some favoured pool for a prolonged campaign.</p>
     <p>Every time that Nigel returned home, a difference, and a striking difference, was observed
      in him. His person, of course, became more manly, his manner more assured, his dress more
      modish. It was impossible to deny that he was extremely good-looking, interesting in his
      discourse, and distinguished in his appearance. Endymion idolised him. Nigel was his model. He
      imitated his manner, caught the tone of his voice, and began to give opinions on subjects,
      sacred and profane.</p>
     <p>After a hard morning’s march, one day, as they were lolling on the turf amid the old beeches
      and the juniper, Nigel said—</p>
     <p>“What does Mr. Ferrars mean you to be, Endymion?”</p>
     <p>“I do not know,” said Endymion, looking perplexed.</p>
     <p>“But I suppose you are to be something?”</p>
     <p>“Yes; I suppose I must be something; because papa has lost his fortune.”</p>
     <p>“And what would you like to be?”</p>
     <p>“I never thought about it,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“In my opinion there is only one thing for a man to be in this age,” said Nigel
      peremptorily; “he should go into the Church.”</p>
     <p>“The Church!” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“There will soon be nothing else left,” said Nigel. “The Church must last for ever. It is
      built upon a rock. It was founded by God; all other governments have been founded by men. When
      they are destroyed, and the process of destruction seems rapid, there will be nothing left to
      govern mankind except the Church.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed!” said Endymion; “papa is very much in favour of the Church, and, I know, is writing
      something about it.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, but Mr. Ferrars is an Erastian,” said Nigel; “you need not tell him I said so, but he
      is one. He wants the Church to be the servant of the State, and all that sort of thing, but
      that will not do any longer. This destruction of the Irish bishoprics has brought affairs to a
      crisis. No human power has the right to destroy a bishopric. It is a divinely-ordained office,
      and when a diocese is once established, it is eternal.”</p>
     <p>“I see,” said Endymion, much interested.</p>
     <p>“I wish,” continued Nigel, “you were two or three years older, and Mr. Ferrars could send
      you to Oxford. That is the place to understand these things, and they will soon be the only
      things to understand. The rector knows nothing about them. My father is thoroughly high and
      dry, and has not the slightest idea of Church principles.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed!” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“It is quite a new set even at Oxford,” continued Nigel; “but their principles are as old as
      the Apostles, and come down from them, straight.”</p>
     <p>“That is a long time ago,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“I have a great fancy,” continued Nigel, without apparently attending to him, “to give you a
      thorough Church education. It would be the making of you. You would then have a purpose in
      life, and never be in doubt or perplexity on any subject. We ought to move heaven and earth to
      induce Mr. Ferrars to send you to Oxford.”</p>
     <p>“I will speak to Myra about it,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“I said something of this to your sister the other day,” said Nigel, “but I fear she is
      terribly Erastian. However, I will give you something to read. It is not very long, but you
      can read it at your leisure, and then we will talk over it afterwards, and perhaps I may give
      you something else.”</p>
     <p>Endymion did not fail to give a report of this conversation and similar ones to his sister,
      for he was in the habit of telling her everything. She listened with attention, but not with
      interest, to his story. Her expression was kind, but hardly serious. Her wondrous eyes gave
      him a glance of blended mockery and affection. “Dear darling,” she said, “if you are to be a
      clergyman, I should like you to be a cardinal.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
     <p>The dark deep hints that had reached Mr. Ferrars at the beginning of 1834 were the
      harbingers of startling events. In the spring it began to be rumoured among the initiated,
      that the mighty Reform Cabinet with its colossal majority, and its testimonial goblets of
      gold, raised by the penny subscriptions of the grateful people, was in convulsions, and before
      the month of July had elapsed Lord Grey had resigned, under circumstances which exhibited the
      entire demoralisation of his party. Except Zenobia, every one was of the opinion that the King
      acted wisely in entrusting the reconstruction of the Whig ministry to his late Secretary of
      State, Lord Melbourne. Nevertheless, it could no longer be concealed, nay, it was invariably
      admitted, that the political situation had been largely and most unexpectedly changed, and
      that there was a prospect, dim, perhaps, yet not undefinable, of the conduct of public affairs
      again falling to the alternate management of two rival constitutional parties.</p>
     <p>Zenobia was so full of hope, and almost of triumph, that she induced her lord in the autumn
      to assemble their political friends at one of his great seats, and Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars were
      urgently invited to join the party. But, after some hesitation, they declined this proposal.
      Had Mr. Ferrars been as sanguine as his wife, he would perhaps have overcome his strong
      disinclination to re-enter the world, but though no longer despairing of a Tory revival, he
      was of opinion that a considerable period, even several years, must elapse before its
      occurrence. Strange to say, he found no difficulty in following his own humour through any
      contrary disposition on the part of Mrs. Ferrars. With all her ambition and passionate love of
      society, she was unwilling to return to that stage, where she once had blazed, in a subdued
      and almost subordinate position. In fact, it was an affair of the wardrobe. The queen of
      costumes, whose fanciful and gorgeous attire even Zenobia was wont to praise, could not endure
      a reappearance in old dresses. “I do not so much care about my jewels, William,” she said to
      her husband, “but one must have new dresses.”</p>
     <p>It was a still mild day in November, a month which in the country, and especially on the
      light soils, has many charms, and the whole Ferrars family were returning home after an
      afternoon ramble on the chase. The leaf had changed but had not fallen, and the vast spiral
      masses of the dark green juniper effectively contrasted with the rich brown foliage of the
      beech, varied occasionally by the scarlet leaves of the wild cherry tree, that always mingles
      with these woods. Around the house were some lime trees of large size, and at this period of
      the year their foliage, still perfect, was literally quite golden. They seemed like trees in
      some fairy tale of imprisoned princesses or wandering cavaliers, and such they would remain,
      until the fatal night that brings the first frost.</p>
     <p>“There is a parcel from London,” said the servant to Mr. Ferrars, as they entered the house.
      “It is on your desk.”</p>
     <p>A parcel from London was one of the great events of their life. What could it be? Perhaps
      some proofs, probably some books. Mr. Ferrars entered his room alone. It was a very small
      brown paper parcel, evidently not books. He opened it hastily, and disencumbered its contents
      of several coverings. The contents took the form of a letter—a single letter.</p>
     <p>The handwriting was recognised, and he read the letter with an agitated countenance, and
      then he opened the door of his room, and called loudly for his wife, who was by his side in a
      few moments.</p>
     <p>“A letter, my love, from Barron,” he cried. “The King has dismissed Lord Melbourne and sent
      for the Duke of Wellington, who has accepted the conduct of affairs.”</p>
     <p>“You must go to town directly,” said his wife. “He offered you the Cabinet in 1832. No
      person has such a strong claim on him as you have.”</p>
     <p>“It does not appear that he is exactly prime minister,” said Mr. Ferrars, looking again at
      the letter. “They have sent for Peel, who is at Rome, but the Duke is to conduct the
      government till he arrives.”</p>
     <p>“You must go to town immediately,” repeated Mrs. Ferrars. “There is not a moment to be lost.
      Send down to the Horse Shoe and secure an inside place in the Salisbury coach. It reaches this
      place at nine to-morrow morning. I will have everything ready. You must take a portmanteau and
      a carpet-bag. I wonder if you could get a bedroom at the Rodneys’. It would be so nice to be
      among old friends; they must feel for you. And then it will be near the Carlton, which is a
      great thing. I wonder how he will form his cabinet. What a pity he is not here!”</p>
     <p>“It is a wonderful event, but the difficulties must be immense,” observed Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“Oh! you always see difficulties. I see none. The King is with us, the country is disgusted.
      It is what I always said would be; the reaction is complete.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we had better now go and tell the children,” said Ferrars. “I leave you all here for
      the first time,” and he seemed to sigh.</p>
     <p>“Well, I hope we shall soon join you,” said Mrs. Ferrars. “It is the very best time for
      hiring a house. What I have set my heart upon is the Green Park. It will be near your office
      and not too near. I am sure I could not live again in a street.”</p>
     <p>The children were informed that public events of importance had occurred, that the King had
      changed his ministry, and that papa must go up to town immediately and see the Duke of
      Wellington. The eyes of Mrs. Ferrars danced with excitement as she communicated to them all
      this intelligence, and much more, with a volubility in which of late years she had rarely
      indulged. Mr. Ferrars looked grave and said little. Then he patted Endymion on the head, and
      kissed Myra, who returned his embrace with a warmth unusual with her.</p>
     <p>The whole household soon became in a state of bustle with the preparations for the early
      departure of Mr. Ferrars. It seemed difficult to comprehend how filling a portmanteau and a
      carpet-bag could induce such excited and continuous exertions. But then there was so much to
      remember, and then there was always something forgotten. Mrs. Ferrars was in her bedroom
      surrounded by all her maids; Mr. Ferrars was in his study looking out some papers which it was
      necessary to take with him. The children were alone.</p>
     <p>“I wonder if we shall be restored to our greatness,” said Myra to Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Well, I shall be sorry to leave the old place; I have been happy here.”</p>
     <p>“I have not,” said Myra; “and I do not think I could have borne this life had it not been
      for you.”</p>
     <p>“It will be a wonderful change,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“If it comes; I fear papa is not daring enough. However, if we get out of this hole, it will
      be something.”</p>
     <p>Tea-time brought them all together again, but when the meal was over, none of the usual
      occupations of the evening were pursued; no work, no books, no reading aloud. Mr. Ferrars was
      to get up very early, and that was a reason for all retiring soon. And yet neither the husband
      nor the wife really cared to sleep. Mrs. Ferrars sate by the fire in his dressing-room,
      speculating on all possible combinations, and infusing into him all her suggestions and all
      her schemes. She was still prudent, and still would have preferred a great government—India if
      possible; but had made up her mind that he must accept the cabinet. Considering what had
      occurred in 1832, she thought he was bound in honour to do so. Her husband listened rather
      than conversed, and seemed lost in thought. At last he rose, and, embracing her with much
      affection, said, “You forget I am to rise with the lark. I shall write to you every day. Best
      and dearest of women, you have always been right, and all my good fortune has come from
      you.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVI</head>
     <p>It was a very tedious journey, and it took the whole day to accomplish a distance which a
      rapid express train now can achieve in an hour. The coach carried six inside passengers, and
      they had to dine on the road. All the passengers were strangers to Mr. Ferrars, and he was by
      them unknown; one of them purchased, though with difficulty, a second edition of the “Times”
      as they approached London, and favoured his fellow-travellers with the news of the change of
      ministry. There was much excitement, and the purchaser of the paper gave it as his opinion,
      “that it was an intrigue of the Court and the Tories, and would never do.” Another modestly
      intimated that he thought there was a decided reaction. A third announced that England would
      never submit to be governed by O’Connell.</p>
     <p>As the gloom of evening descended, Mr. Ferrars felt depressed. Though his life at Hurstley
      had been pensive and melancholy, he felt now the charm and the want of that sweet domestic
      distraction which had often prevented his mind from over-brooding, and had softened life by
      sympathy in little things. Nor was it without emotion that he found himself again in London,
      that proud city where once he had himself been so proud. The streets were lighted, and seemed
      swarming with an infinite population, and the coach finally stopped at a great inn in the
      Strand, where Mr. Ferrars thought it prudent to secure accommodation for the night. It was too
      late to look after the Rodneys, but in deference to the strict injunction of Mrs. Ferrars, he
      paid them a visit next morning on his way to his political chief.</p>
     <p>In the days of the great modistes, when an English lady might absolutely be dressed in
      London, the most celebrated mantua-maker in that city was Madame Euphrosyne. She was as
      fascinating as she was fashionable. She was so graceful, her manners were so pretty, so
      natural, and so insinuating! She took so lively an interest in her clients—her very heart was
      in their good looks. She was a great favourite of Mrs. Ferrars, and that lady of Madame
      Euphrosyne. She assured Mrs. Ferrars that she was prouder of dressing Mrs. Ferrars than all
      the other fine ladies in London together, and Mrs. Ferrars believed her. Unfortunately, while
      in the way of making a large fortune, Madame Euphrosyne, who was romantic, fell in love with,
      and married, a very handsome and worthless husband, whose good looks had obtained for him a
      position in the company of Drury Lane Theatre, then a place of refined resort, which his
      abilities did not justify. After pillaging and plundering his wife for many years, he finally
      involved her in such engagements, that she had to take refuge in the Bankruptcy Court. Her
      business was ruined, and her spirit was broken, and she died shortly after of adversity and
      chagrin. Her daughter Sylvia was then eighteen, and had inherited with the grace of her mother
      the beauty of her less reputable parent. Her figure was slight and undulating, and she was
      always exquisitely dressed. A brilliant complexion set off to advantage her delicate features,
      which, though serene, were not devoid of a certain expression of archness. Her white hands
      were delicate, her light eyes inclined to merriment, and her nose quite a gem, though a little
      turned up.</p>
     <p>After their ruin, her profligate father told her that her face was her fortune, and that she
      must provide for herself, in which she would find no difficulty. But Sylvia, though she had
      never enjoyed the advantage of any training, moral or religious, had no bad impulses even if
      she had no good ones, was of a rather cold character, and extremely prudent. She recoiled from
      the life of riot, and disorder, and irregularity, in which she had unwittingly passed her
      days, and which had terminated so tragically, and she resolved to make an effort to secure for
      herself a different career. She had heard that Mrs. Ferrars was in want of an attendant, and
      she determined to apply for the post. As one of the chief customers of her mother, Sylvia had
      been in the frequent habit of waiting on that lady, with whom she had become a favourite. She
      was so pretty, and the only person who could fit Mrs. Ferrars. Her appeal, therefore, was not
      in vain; it was more than successful. Mrs. Ferrars was attracted by Sylvia. Mrs. Ferrars was
      magnificent, generous, and she liked to be a patroness and surrounded by favourites. She
      determined that Sylvia should not sink into a menial position; she adopted her as a humble
      friend, and one who every day became more regarded by her. Sylvia arranged her invitations to
      her receptions, a task which required finish and precision; sometimes wrote her notes. She
      spoke and wrote French too, and that was useful, was a musician, and had a pretty voice. Above
      all, she was a first-rate counsellor in costume; and so, looking also after Mrs. Ferrars’ dogs
      and birds, she became almost one of the family; dined with them often when they were alone,
      and was frequently Mrs. Ferrars’ companion in her carriage.</p>
     <p>Sylvia, though not by nature impulsive, really adored her patroness. She governed her
      manners and she modelled her dress on that great original, and, next to Mrs. Ferrars, Sylvia
      in time became nearly the finest lady in London. There was, indeed, much in Mrs. Ferrars to
      captivate a person like Sylvia. Mrs. Ferrars was beautiful, fashionable, gorgeous, wonderfully
      expensive, and, where her taste was pleased, profusely generous. Her winning manner was not
      less irresistible because it was sometimes uncertain, and she had the art of being intimate
      without being familiar.</p>
     <p>When the crash came, Sylvia was really broken-hearted, or believed she was, and implored
      that she might attend the deposed sovereigns into exile; but that was impossible, however
      anxious they might be as to the future of their favourite. Her destiny was sooner decided than
      they could have anticipated. There was a member of the household, or rather family, in Hill
      Street, who bore almost the same relation to Mr. Ferrars as Sylvia to his wife. This was Mr.
      Rodney, a remarkably good-looking person, by nature really a little resembling his principal,
      and completing the resemblance by consummate art. The courtiers of Alexander of Macedonia
      could not study their chief with more devotion, or more sedulously imitate his mien and
      carriage, than did Mr. Rodney that distinguished individual of whom he was the humble friend,
      and who he was convinced was destined to be Prime Minister of England. Mr. Rodney was the son
      of the office-keeper of old Mr. Ferrars, and it was the ambition of the father that his son,
      for whom he had secured a sound education, should become a member of the civil service. It had
      become an apothegm in the Ferrars family that something must be done for Rodney, and whenever
      the apparent occasion failed, which was not unfrequent, old Mr. Ferrars used always to add,
      “Never mind; so long as I live, Rodney shall never want a home.” The object of all this
      kindness, however, was little distressed by their failures in his preferment. He had implicit
      faith in the career of his friend and master, and looked forward to the time when it might not
      be impossible that he himself might find a haven in a commissionership. Recently Mr. Ferrars
      had been able to confer on him a small post with duties not too engrossing, and which did not
      prevent his regular presence in Hill Street, where he made himself generally useful.</p>
     <p>If there were anything confidential to be accomplished in their domestic life, everything
      might be trusted to his discretion and entire devotion. He supervised the establishment
      without injudiciously interfering with the house-steward, copied secret papers for Mr.
      Ferrars, and when that gentleman was out of office acted as his private secretary. Mr. Rodney
      was the most official person in the ministerial circle. He considered human nature only with
      reference to office. No one was so intimately acquainted with all the details of the lesser
      patronage as himself, and his hours of study were passed in the pages of the “Peerage” and in
      penetrating the mysteries of the “Royal Calendar.”</p>
     <p>The events of 1832, therefore, to this gentleman were scarcely a less severe blow than to
      the Ferrars family itself. Indeed, like his chief, he looked upon himself as the victim of a
      revolution. Mr. Rodney had always been an admirer of Sylvia, but no more. He had accompanied
      her to the theatre, and had attended her to the park, but this was quite understood on both
      sides only to be gallantry; both, perhaps, in their prosperity, with respect to the serious
      step of life, had indulged in higher dreams. But the sympathy of sorrow is stronger than the
      sympathy of prosperity. In the darkness of their lives, each required comfort: he murmured
      some accents of tender solace, and Sylvia agreed to become Mrs. Rodney.</p>
     <p>When they considered their position, the prospect was not free from anxiety. To marry and
      then separate is, where there is affection, trying. His income would secure them little more
      than a roof, but how to live under that roof was a mystery. For her to become a governess, and
      for him to become a secretary, and to meet only on an occasional Sunday, was a sorry lot. And
      yet both possessed accomplishments or acquirements which ought in some degree to be
      productive. Rodney had a friend, and he determined to consult him.</p>
     <p>That friend was no common person; he was Mr. Vigo, by birth a Yorkshireman, and gifted with
      all the attributes, physical and intellectual, of that celebrated race. At present he was the
      most fashionable tailor in London, and one whom many persons consulted. Besides being
      consummate in his art, Mr. Vigo had the reputation of being a man of singularly good judgment.
      He was one who obtained influence over all with whom he came in contact, and as his business
      placed him in contact with various classes, but especially with the class socially most
      distinguished, his influence was great. The golden youth who repaired to his counters came
      there not merely to obtain raiment of the best material and the most perfect cut, but to see
      and talk with Mr. Vigo, and to ask his opinion on various points. There was a spacious room
      where, if they liked, they might smoke a cigar, and “Vigo’s cigars” were something which no
      one could rival. If they liked to take a glass of hock with their tobacco, there was a bottle
      ready from the cellars of Johannisberg. Mr. Vigo’s stable was almost as famous as its master;
      he drove the finest horses in London, and rode the best hunters in the Vale of Aylesbury. With
      all this, his manners were exactly what they should be. He was neither pretentious nor
      servile, but simple, and with becoming respect for others and for himself. He never took a
      liberty with any one, and such treatment, as is generally the case, was reciprocal.</p>
     <p>Mr. Vigo was much attached to Mr. Rodney, and was proud of his intimate acquaintance with
      him. He wanted a friend not of his own order, for that would not increase or improve his
      ideas, but one conversant with the habits and feelings of a superior class, and yet he did not
      want a fine gentleman for an intimate, who would have been either an insolent patron or a
      designing parasite. Rodney had relations with the aristocracy, with the political world, and
      could feel the pulse of public life. His appearance was engaging, his manners gentle if not
      gentlemanlike, and he had a temper never disturbed. This is a quality highly appreciated by
      men of energy and fire, who may happen not to have a complete self-control.</p>
     <p>When Rodney detailed to his friend the catastrophe that had occurred and all its sad
      consequences, Mr. Vigo heard him in silence, occasionally nodding his head in sympathy or
      approbation, or scrutinising a statement with his keen hazel eye. When his visitor had
      finished, he said—</p>
     <p>“When there has been a crash, there is nothing like a change of scene. I propose that you
      and Mrs. Rodney should come and stay with me a week at my house at Barnes, and there a good
      many things may occur to us.”</p>
     <p>And so, towards the end of the week, when the Rodneys had exhausted their whole programme of
      projects, against every one of which there seemed some invincible objection, their host said,
      “You know I rather speculate in houses. I bought one last year in Warwick Street. It is a
      large roomy house in a quiet situation, though in a bustling quarter, just where members of
      parliament would like to lodge. I have put it in thorough repair. What I propose is that you
      should live there, let the first and second floors—they are equally good—and live on the
      ground floor yourselves, which is amply convenient. We will not talk about rent till the year
      is over and we see how it answers. The house is unfurnished, but that is nothing. I will
      introduce you to a friend of mine who will furnish it for you solidly and handsomely, you
      paying a percentage on the amount expended. He will want a guarantee, but of course I will be
      that. It is an experiment, but try it. Try it for a year; at any rate you will be a
      householder, and you will have the opportunity of thinking of something else.”</p>
     <p>Hitherto the Rodneys had been successful in their enterprise, and the soundness of Mr.
      Vigo’s advice had been proved. Their house was full, and of the best tenants. Their first
      floor was taken by a distinguished M.P., a county member of repute whom Mr. Rodney had known
      before the “revolution,” and who was so pleased with his quarters, and the comfort and
      refinement of all about him, that to ensure their constant enjoyment he became a yearly
      tenant. Their second floor, which was nearly as good as their first, was inhabited by a young
      gentleman of fashion, who took them originally only by the week, and who was always going to
      give them up, but never did. The weekly lodger went to Paris, and he went to German baths, and
      he went to country houses, and he was frequently a long time away, but he never gave up his
      lodgings. When therefore Mr. Ferrars called in Warwick Street, the truth is the house was full
      and there was no vacant room for him. But this the Rodneys would not admit. Though they were
      worldly people, and it seemed impossible that anything more could be gained from the ruined
      house of Hurstley, they had, like many other people, a superstition, and their superstition
      was an adoration of the family of Ferrars. The sight of their former master, who, had it not
      been for the revolution, might have been Prime Minister of England, and the recollection of
      their former mistress and all her splendour, and all the rich dresses which she used to give
      so profusely to her dependent, quite overwhelmed them. Without consultation this sympathising
      couple leapt to the same conclusion. They assured Mr. Ferrars they could accommodate him, and
      that he should find everything prepared for him when he called again, and they resigned to
      him, without acknowledging it, their own commodious and well-furnished chamber, which Mrs.
      Rodney prepared for him with the utmost solicitude, arranging his writing-table and materials
      as he used to have them in Hill Street, and showing by a variety of modes she remembered all
      his ways.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
     <p>After securing his room in Warwick Street, Mr. Ferrars called on his political chiefs.
      Though engrossed with affairs, the moment his card was exhibited he was seen, cordially
      welcomed, and addressed in confidence. Not only were his claims acknowledged without being
      preferred, but an evidently earnest hope was expressed that they might be fully satisfied. No
      one had suffered more for the party and no one had worked harder or more effectively for it.
      But at present nothing could be done and nothing more could be said. All depended on Peel.
      Until he arrived nothing could be arranged. Their duties were limited to provisionally
      administering the affairs of the country until his appearance.</p>
     <p>It was many days, even weeks, before that event could happen. The messenger would travel to
      Rome night and day, but it was calculated that nearly three weeks must elapse before his
      return. Mr. Ferrars then went to the Carlton Club, which he had assisted in forming three or
      four years before, and had established in a house of modern dimensions in Charles Street, St.
      James. It was called then the Charles Street gang, and none but the thoroughgoing cared to
      belong to it. Now he found it flourishing in a magnificent mansion on Carlton Terrace, while
      in very sight of its windows, on a plot of ground in Pall Mall, a palace was rising to receive
      it. It counted already fifteen hundred members, who had been selected by an omniscient and
      scrutinising committee, solely with reference to their local influence throughout the country,
      and the books were overflowing with impatient candidates of rank, and wealth, and power.</p>
     <p>Three years ago Ferrars had been one of the leading spirits of this great confederacy, and
      now he entered the superb chamber, and it seemed to him that he did not recognise a human
      being. Yet it was full to overflowing, and excitement and anxiety and bustle were impressed on
      every countenance. If he had heard some of the whispers and remarks, as he entered and moved
      about, his self-complacency would scarcely have been gratified.</p>
     <p>“Who is that?” inquired a young M.P. of a brother senator not much more experienced.</p>
     <p>“Have not the remotest idea; never saw him before. Barron is speaking to him; he will tell
      us. I say, Barron, who is your friend?”</p>
     <p>“That is Ferrars!”</p>
     <p>“Ferrars! who is he?”</p>
     <p>“One of our best men. If all our fellows had fought like him against the Reform Bill, that
      infernal measure would never have been carried.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! ah! I remember something now,” said the young M.P., “but anything that happened before
      the election of ‘32 I look upon as an old almanack.”</p>
     <p>However, notwithstanding the first and painful impression of strangers and strangeness, when
      a little time had elapsed Ferrars found many friends, and among the most distinguished
      present. Nothing could be more hearty than their greeting, and he had not been in the room
      half an hour before he had accepted an invitation to dine that very day with Lord Pomeroy.</p>
     <p>It was a large and rather miscellaneous party, but all of the right kidney. Some men who had
      been cabinet ministers, and some who expected to be; several occupiers in old days of the
      secondary offices; both the whips, one noisy and the other mysterious; several lawyers of
      repute who must be brought into parliament, and some young men who had distinguished
      themselves in the reformed house and whom Ferrars had never seen before. “It is like old
      days,” said the husband of Zenobia to Ferrars, who sate next to him; “I hope it will float,
      but we shall know nothing till Peel comes.”</p>
     <p>“He will have difficulty with his cabinet so far as the House of Commons is concerned,” said
      an old privy councillor “They must have seats, and his choice is very limited.”</p>
     <p>“He will dissolve,” said the husband of Zenobia. “He must.”</p>
     <p>“Wheugh!” said the privy councillor, and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
     <p>“The old story will not do,” said the husband of Zenobia. “We must have new blood. Peel must
      reconstruct on a broad basis.”</p>
     <p>“Well, they say there is no lack of converts,” said the old privy councillor.</p>
     <p>All this, and much more that he heard, made Ferrars ponder, and anxiously. No cabinet
      without parliament. It was but reasonable. A dissolution was therefore in his interest. And
      yet, what a prospect! A considerable expenditure, and yet with a considerable expenditure a
      doubtful result. Then reconstruction on a broad basis—what did that mean? Neither more nor
      less than rival candidates for office. There was no lack of converts. He dare say not. A great
      deal had developed since his exile at Hurstley—things which are not learned by newspapers, or
      even private correspondence. He spoke to Barron after dinner. He had reason to believe Barron
      was his friend. Barron could give no opinion about dissolution; all depended on Peel. But they
      were acting, and had been acting for some time, as if dissolution were on the cards. Ferrars
      had better call upon him to-morrow, and go over the list, and see what would be done for him.
      He had every claim.</p>
     <p>The man with every claim called on Barron on the morrow, and saw his secret list, and
      listened to all his secret prospects and secret plans. There was more than one manufacturing
      town where there was an opening; decided reaction, and a genuine Conservative feeling. Barron
      had no doubt that, although a man might not get in the first time he stood, he would
      ultimately. Ultimately was not a word which suited Mr. Ferrars. There were several old
      boroughs where the freemen still outnumbered the ten-pounders, and where the prospects were
      more encouraging; but the expense was equal to the goodness of the chance, and although
      Ferrars had every claim, and would no doubt be assisted, still one could not shut one’s eyes
      to the fact that the personal expenditure must be considerable. The agricultural boroughs must
      be fought, at least this time, by local men. Something might be done with an Irish borough;
      expense, comparatively speaking inconsiderable, but the politics deeply Orange.</p>
     <p>Gloom settled on the countenance of this spoiled child of politics, who had always sate for
      a close borough, and who recoiled from a contest like a woman, when he pictured to himself the
      struggle and exertion and personal suffering he would have to encounter and endure, and then
      with no certainty of success. The trained statesman, who had anticipated the mass of his party
      on Catholic emancipation, to become an Orange candidate! It was worse than making speeches to
      ten-pounders and canvassing freemen!</p>
     <p>“I knew things were difficult,” said Ferrars; “but I was in hopes that there were yet some
      seats that we might command.”</p>
     <p>“No doubt there are,” said Mr. Barron; “but they are few, and they are occupied—at least at
      present. But, after all, a thousand things may turn up, and you may consider nothing
      definitely arranged until Sir Robert arrives. The great thing is to be on the spot.”</p>
     <p>Ferrars wrote to his wife daily, and kept her minutely acquainted with the course of
      affairs. She agreed with Barron that the great thing was to be on the spot. She felt sure that
      something would turn up. She was convinced that Sir Robert would send for him, offer him the
      cabinet, and at the same time provide him with a seat. Her own inclination was still in favour
      of a great colonial or foreign appointment. She still hankered after India; but if the cabinet
      were offered, as was certain, she did not consider that William, as a man of honour, could
      refuse to accept the trust and share the peril.</p>
     <p>So Ferrars remained in London under the roof of the Rodneys. The feverish days passed in the
      excitement of political life in all its manifold forms, grave council and light gossip,
      dinners with only one subject of conversation, and that never palling, and at last, even
      evenings spent again under the roof of Zenobia, who, the instant her winter apartments were
      ready to receive the world, had hurried up to London and raised her standard in St. James’
      Square. “It was like old days,” as her husband had said to Ferrars when they met after a long
      separation.</p>
     <p>Was it like old days? he thought to himself when he was alone. Old days, when the present
      had no care, and the future was all hope; when he was proud, and justly proud, of the public
      position he had achieved, and of all the splendid and felicitous circumstances of life that
      had clustered round him. He thought of those away, and with whom during the last three years
      he had so continuously and intimately lived. And his hired home that once had been associated
      only in his mind with exile, imprisonment, misfortune, almost disgrace, became hallowed by
      affection, and in the agony of the suspense which now involved him, and to encounter which he
      began to think his diminished nerve unequal, he would have bargained for the rest of his life
      to pass undisturbed in that sweet solitude, in the delights of study and the tranquillity of
      domestic love.</p>
     <p>A little not unamiable weakness this, but it passed off in the morning like a dream, when
      Mr. Ferrars heard that Sir Robert had arrived.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
     <p>It was a dark December night when Mr. Ferrars returned to Hurstley. His wife, accompanied by
      the gardener with a lantern, met him on the green. She embraced him, and whispered, “Is it
      very bad, love? I fear you have softened it to me?”</p>
     <p>“By no means bad, and I told you the truth: not all, for had I, my letter would have been
      too late. He said nothing about the cabinet, but offered me a high post in his government,
      provided I could secure my seat. That was impossible. During the month I was in town I had
      realised that. I thought it best, therefore, at once to try the other tack, and nothing could
      be more satisfactory.”</p>
     <p>“Did you say anything about India?” she said in a very low voice.</p>
     <p>“I did not. He is an honourable man, but he is cold, and my manner is not distinguished for
       <hi>abandon</hi>. I thought it best to speak generally, and leave it to him. He acknowledged
      my claim, and my fitness for such posts, and said if his government lasted it would gratify
      him to meet my wishes. Barron says the government will last. They will have a majority, and if
      Stanley and Graham had joined them, they would have had not an inconsiderable one. But in that
      case I should probably not have had the cabinet, if indeed he meant to offer it to me
      now.”</p>
     <p>“Of course he did,” said his wife. “Who has such claims as you have? Well, now we must hope
      and watch. Look cheerful to the children, for they have been very anxious.”</p>
     <p>With this hint the meeting was not unhappy, and the evening passed with amusement and
      interest. Endymion embraced his father with warmth, and Myra kissed him on both cheeks. Mr.
      Ferrars had a great deal of gossip which interested his wife, and to a certain degree his
      children. The latter of course remembered Zenobia, and her sayings and doings were always
      amusing. There were anecdotes, too, of illustrious persons which always interest, especially
      when in the personal experience of those with whom we are intimately connected. What the Duke,
      or Sir Robert, or Lord Lyndhurst said to papa seemed doubly wiser or brighter than if it had
      been said to a third person. Their relations with the world of power, and fashion, and fame,
      seemed not to be extinct, at least reviving from their torpid condition. Mr. Ferrars had also
      brought a German book for Myra; and “as for you, Endymion,” he said, “I have been much more
      successful for you than for your father, though I hope I shall not have myself in the long run
      to complain. Our friends are faithful to us, and I have got you put down on the private list
      for a clerkship both in the Foreign Office and the Treasury. They are the two best things, and
      you will have one of the first vacancies that will occur in either department. I know your
      mother wishes you to be in the Foreign Office. Let it be so if it come. I confess, myself,
      remembering your grandfather’s career, I have always a weakness for the Treasury, but so long
      as I see you well planted in Whitehall, I shall be content. Let me see, you will be sixteen in
      March. I could have wished you to wait another year, but we must be ready when the opening
      occurs.”</p>
     <p>The general election in 1834-5, though it restored the balance of parties, did not secure to
      Sir Robert Peel a majority, and the anxiety of the family at Hurstley was proportionate to the
      occasion. Barron was always sanguine, but the vote on the Speakership could not but alarm
      them. Barron said it did not signify, and that Sir Robert had resolved to go on and had
      confidence in his measures. His measures were excellent, and Sir Robert never displayed more
      resource, more energy, and more skill, than he did in the spring of 1835. But knowledge of
      human nature was not Sir Robert Peel’s strong point, and it argued some deficiency in that
      respect, to suppose that the fitness of his measures could disarm a vindictive opposition. On
      the contrary, they rather whetted their desire of revenge, and they were doubly loth that he
      should increase his reputation by availing himself of an opportunity which they deemed the
      Tory party had unfairly acquired.</p>
     <p>After the vote on the Speakership, Mr. Ferrars was offered a second-class West Indian
      government. His wife would not listen to it. If it were Jamaica, the offer might be
      considered, though it could scarcely be accepted without great sacrifice. The children, for
      instance, must be left at home. Strange to say, Mr. Ferrars was not disinclined to accept the
      inferior post. Endymion he looked upon as virtually provided for, and Myra, he thought, might
      accompany them; if only for a year. But he ultimately yielded, though not without a struggle,
      to the strong feeling of his wife.</p>
     <p>“I do not see why I also should not be left behind,” said Myra to her brother in one of
      their confidential walks. “I should like to live in London in lodgings with you.”</p>
     <p>The approaching appointment of her brother filled her from the first with the greatest
      interest. She was always talking of it when they were alone—fancying his future life, and
      planning how it might be happier and more easy. “My only joy in life is seeing you,” she
      sometimes said, “and yet this separation does not make me unhappy. It seems a chance from
      heaven for you. I pray every night it may be the Foreign Office.”</p>
     <p>The ministry were still sanguine as to their prospects in the month of March, and they
      deemed that public opinion was rallying round Sir Robert. Perhaps Lord John Russell, who was
      the leader of the opposition, felt this, in some degree, himself, and he determined to bring
      affairs to a crisis by notice of a motion respecting the appropriation of the revenues of the
      Irish Church. Then Barron wrote to Mr. Ferrars that affairs did not look so well, and advised
      him to come up to town, and take anything that offered. “It is something,” he remarked, “to
      have something to give up. We shall not, I suppose, always be out of office, and they get
      preferred more easily whose promotion contributes to patronage, even while they claim its
      exercise.”</p>
     <p>The ministry were in a minority on the Irish Church on April 2, the day on which Mr. Ferrars
      arrived in town. They did not resign, but the attack was to be repeated in another form on the
      6th. During the terrible interval Mr. Ferrars made distracted visits to Downing Street, saw
      secretaries of state, who sympathised with him not withstanding their own chagrin, and was
      closeted daily and hourly with under-secretaries, parliamentary and permanent, who really
      alike wished to serve him. But there was nothing to be had. He was almost meditating taking
      Sierra Leone, or the Gold Coast, when the resignation of Sir Robert Peel was announced. At the
      last moment, there being, of course, no vacancy in the Foreign Office, or the Treasury, he
      obtained from Barron an appointment for Endymion, and so, after having left Hurstley five
      months before to become Governor-General of India, this man, “who had claims,” returned to his
      mortified home with a clerkship for his son in a second-rate government office.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
     <p>Disappointment and distress, it might be said despair, seemed fast settling again over the
      devoted roof of Hurstley, after a three years’ truce of tranquillity. Even the crushing
      termination of her worldly hopes was forgotten for the moment by Mrs. Ferrars in her anguish
      at the prospect of separation from Endymion. Such a catastrophe she had never for a moment
      contemplated. True it was she had been delighted with the scheme of his entering the Foreign
      Office, but that was on the assumption that she was to enter office herself, and that,
      whatever might be the scene of the daily labours of her darling child, her roof should be his
      home, and her indulgent care always at his command. But that she was absolutely to part with
      Endymion, and that, at his tender age, he was to be launched alone into the wide world, was an
      idea that she could not entertain, or even comprehend. Who was to clothe him, and feed him,
      and tend him, and save him from being run over, and guide and guard him in all the
      difficulties and dangers of this mundane existence? It was madness, it was impossible. But Mr.
      Ferrars, though gentle, was firm. No doubt it was to be wished that the event could have been
      postponed for a year; but its occurrence, unless all prospect of establishment in life were
      surrendered, was inevitable, and a slight delay would hardly render the conditions under which
      it happened less trying. Though Endymion was only sixteen, he was tall and manly beyond his
      age, and during the latter years of his life, his naturally sweet temper and genial
      disposition had been schooled in self-discipline and self-sacrifice. He was not to be wholly
      left to strangers; Mr. Ferrars had spoken to Rodney about receiving him, at least for the
      present, and steps would be taken that those who presided over his office would be influenced
      in his favour. The appointment was certainly not equal to what had been originally
      anticipated; but still the department, though not distinguished, was highly respectable, and
      there was no reason on earth, if the opportunity offered, that Endymion should not be removed
      from his present post to one in the higher departments of the state. But if this opening were
      rejected, what was to be the future of their son? They could not afford to send him to the
      University, nor did Mr. Ferrars wish him to take refuge in the bosom of the Church. As for the
      army, they had now no interest to acquire commissions, and if they could succeed so far, they
      could not make him an allowance, which would permit him to maintain himself as became his
      rank. The civil service remained, in which his grandfather had been eminent, and in which his
      own parent, at any rate, though the victim of a revolution, had not disgraced himself. It
      seemed, under the circumstances, the natural avenue for their child. At least, he thought it
      ought to be tried. He wished nothing to be settled without the full concurrence of Endymion
      himself. The matter should be put fairly and clearly before him, “and for this purpose,”
      concluded Mr. Ferrars, “I have just sent for him to my room;” and he retired.</p>
     <p>The interview between the father and the son was long. When Endymion left the room his
      countenance was pale, but its expression was firm and determined. He went forth into the
      garden, and there he saw Myra. “How long you have been!” she said; “I have been watching for
      you. What is settled?”</p>
     <p>He took her arm, and in silence led her away into one of the glades Then he said: “I have
      settled to go, and I am resolved, so long as I live, that I will never cost dear papa another
      shilling. Things here are very bad, quite as bad as you have sometimes fancied. But do not say
      anything to poor mamma about them.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Ferrars resolved that Endymion should go to London immediately, and the preparations for
      his departure were urgent. Myra did everything. If she had been the head of a family she could
      not have been more thoughtful or apparently more experienced. If she had a doubt, she stepped
      over to Mrs. Penruddock and consulted her. As for Mrs. Ferrars, she had become very unwell,
      and unable to attend to anything. Her occasional interference, fitful and feverish, and
      without adequate regard to circumstances, only embarrassed them. But, generally speaking, she
      kept to her own room, and was always weeping.</p>
     <p>The last day came. No one pretended not to be serious and grave. Mrs. Ferrars did not
      appear, but saw Endymion alone. She did not speak, but locked him in her arms for many
      minutes, and then kissed him on the forehead, and, by a gentle motion, intimating that he
      should retire, she fell back on her sofa with closed eyes. He was alone for a short time with
      his father after dinner. Mr. Ferrars said to him: “I have treated you in this matter as a man,
      and I have entire confidence in you. Your business in life is to build up again a family which
      was once honoured.”</p>
     <p>Myra was still copying inventories when he returned to the drawing-room. “These are for
      myself,” she said, “so I shall always know what you ought to have. Though you go so early, I
      shall make your breakfast to-morrow,” and, leaning back on the sofa, she took his hand.
      “Things are dark, and I fancy they will be darker; but brightness will come, somehow or other,
      to you, darling, for you are born for brightness. You will find friends in life, and they will
      be women.”</p>
     <p>It was nearly three years since Endymion had travelled down to Hurstley by the same coach
      that was now carrying him to London. Though apparently so uneventful, the period had not been
      unimportant in the formation, doubtless yet partial, of his character. And all its influences
      had been beneficial to him. The crust of pride and selfishness with which large prosperity and
      illimitable indulgence had encased a kind, and far from presumptuous, disposition had been
      removed; the domestic sentiments in their sweetness and purity had been developed; he had
      acquired some skills in scholarship and no inconsiderable fund of sound information; and the
      routine of religious thought had been superseded in his instance by an amount of knowledge and
      feeling on matters theological, unusual at his time of life. Though apparently not gifted with
      any dangerous vivacity, or fatal facility of acquisition, his mind seemed clear and
      painstaking, and distinguished by common sense. He was brave and accurate.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rodney was in waiting for him at the inn. He seemed a most distinguished gentleman. A
      hackney coach carried them to Warwick Street, where he was welcomed by Mrs. Rodney, who was
      exquisitely dressed. There was also her sister, a girl not older than Endymion, the very image
      of Mrs. Rodney, except that she was a brunette—a brilliant brunette. This sister bore the
      romantic name of Imogene, for which she was indebted to her father performing the part of the
      husband of the heroine in Maturin’s tragedy of the “Castle of St. Aldobrand,” and which, under
      the inspiration of Kean, had set the town in a blaze about the time of her birth. Tea was
      awaiting him, and there was a mixture in their several manners of not ungraceful hospitality
      and the remembrance of past dependence, which was genuine and not uninteresting, though
      Endymion was yet too inexperienced to observe all this.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Rodney talked very much of Endymion’s mother; her wondrous beauty, her more wondrous
      dresses; the splendour of her fetes and equipages. As she dilated on the past, she seemed to
      share its lustre and its triumphs. “The first of the land were always in attendance on her,”
      and for Mrs. Rodney’s part, she never saw a real horsewoman since her dear lady. Her sister
      did not speak, but listened with rapt attention to the gorgeous details, occasionally stealing
      a glance at Endymion—a glance of deep interest, of admiration mingled as it were both with
      reverence and pity.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rodney took up the conversation if his wife paused. He spoke of all the leading
      statesmen who had been the habitual companions of Mr. Ferrars, and threw out several anecdotes
      respecting them from personal experience. “I knew them all,” continued Mr. Rodney, “I might
      say intimately;” and then he told his great anecdote, how he had been so fortunate as perhaps
      even to save the Duke’s life during the Reform Bill riots. “His Grace has never forgotten it,
      and only the day before yesterday I met him in St. James’ Street walking with Mr. Arbuthnot,
      and he touched his hat to me.”</p>
     <p>All this gossip and good nature, and the kind and lively scene, saved Endymion from the
      inevitable pang, or at least greatly softened it, which accompanies our first separation from
      home. In due season, Mrs. Rodney observed that she doubted not Mr. Endymion, for so they ever
      called him, must be wearied with his journey, and would like to retire to his room; and her
      husband, immediately lighting a candle, prepared to introduce their new lodger to his
      quarters.</p>
     <p>It was a tall house, which had recently been renovated, with a story added to it, and on
      this story was Endymion’s chamber; not absolutely a garret, but a modern substitute for that
      sort of apartment. “It is rather high,” said Mr. Rodney, half apologising for the ascent, “but
      Mr. Ferrars himself chose the room. We took the liberty of lighting a fire to-night.”</p>
     <p>And the cheerful blaze was welcome. It lit up a room clean and not uncomfortable. Feminine
      solicitude had fashioned a toilette-table for him, and there was a bunch of geraniums in a
      blue vase on its sparkling dimity garniture. “I suppose you have in your bag all that you want
      at present?” said Mr. Rodney. “To-morrow we will unpack your trunks and arrange your things in
      their drawers; and after breakfast, if you please, I will show you your way to Somerset
      House.”</p>
     <p>Somerset House! thought Endymion, as he stood before the fire alone. Is it so near as that?
      To-morrow, and I am to be at Somerset House! And then he thought of what they were doing at
      Hurstley—of that terrible parting with his mother, which made him choke—and of his father’s
      last words. And then he thought of Myra, and the tears stole down his cheek. And then he knelt
      down by his bedside and prayed.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
     <p>Mr. Rodney would have accompanied Endymion to Somerset House under any circumstances, but it
      so happened that he had reasons of his own for a visit to that celebrated building. He had
      occasion to see a gentleman who was stationed there. “Not,” as he added to Endymion, “that I
      know many here, but at the Treasury and in Downing Street I have several acquaintances.”</p>
     <p>They separated at the door in the great quadrangle which led to the department to which
      Endymion was attached, and he contrived in due time to deliver to a messenger a letter
      addressed to his future chief. He was kept some time in a gloomy and almost unfurnished
      waiting-room, and his thoughts in a desponding mood were gathering round the dear ones who
      were distant, when he was summoned, and, following the messenger down a passage, was ushered
      into a lively apartment on which the sun was shining, and which, with its well-lined
      book-shelves, and tables covered with papers, and bright noisy clock, and general air of
      habitation and business, contrasted favourably with the room he had just quitted. A
      good-natured-looking man held out his hand and welcomed him cordially, and said at once, “I
      served, Mr. Ferrars, under your grandfather at the Treasury, and I am glad to see you here.”
      Then he spoke of the duties which Endymion would have at present to discharge. His labours at
      first would be somewhat mechanical; they would require only correctness and diligence; but the
      office was a large one, and promotion not only sure, but sometimes rapid, and as he was so
      young, he might with attention count on attaining, while yet in the prime of life, a future of
      very responsible duties and of no inconsiderable emolument. And while he was speaking he rang
      the bell and commanded the attendance of a clerk, under whose care Endymion was specially
      placed. This was a young man of pleasant address, who invited Endymion with kindness to
      accompany him, and leading him through several chambers, some capacious, and all full of
      clerks seated on high stools and writing at desks, finally ushered him into a smaller chamber
      where there were not above six or eight at work, and where there was a vacant seat. “This is
      your place,” he said, “and now I will introduce you to your future comrades. This is Mr.
      Jawett, the greatest Radical of the age, and who, when he is President of the Republic, will,
      I hope, do a job for his friends here. This is Mr. St. Barbe, who, when the public taste has
      improved, will be the most popular author of the day. In the meantime he will give you a copy
      of his novel, which has not sold as it ought to have done, and in which we say he has quizzed
      all his friends. This is Mr. Seymour Hicks, who, as you must perceive, is a man of fashion.”
      And so he went on, with what was evidently accustomed raillery. All laughed, and all said
      something courteous to Endymion, and then after a few minutes they resumed their tasks,
      Endymion’s work being to copy long lists of figures, and routine documents of public
      accounts.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, Mr. St. Barbe was busy in drawing up a public document of a different but
      important character, and which was conceived something in this fashion:—</p>
     <p>“We, the undersigned, highly approving of the personal appearance and manners of our new
      colleague, are unanimously of opinion that he should be invited to join our symposium to-day
      at the immortal Joe’s.”</p>
     <p>This was quietly passed round and signed by all present, and then given to Mr. Trenchard,
      who, all unconsciously to the copying Endymion, wrote upon it, like a minister of state,
      “Approved,” with his initial.</p>
     <p>Joe’s, more technically known as “The Blue Posts,” was a celebrated chop-house in Naseby
      Street, a large, low-ceilinged, wainscoted room, with the floor strewn with sawdust, and a
      hissing kitchen in the centre, and fitted up with what were called boxes, these being of
      various sizes, and suitable to the number of the guests requiring them. About this time the
      fashionable coffee-houses, George’s and the Piazza, and even the coffee-rooms of Stevens’ or
      Long’s, had begun to feel the injurious competition of the new clubs that of late years had
      been established; but these, after all, were limited, and, comparatively speaking, exclusive
      societies. Their influence had not touched the chop-houses, and it required another quarter of
      a century before their cheerful and hospitable roofs and the old taverns of London, so full,
      it ever seemed, of merriment and wisdom, yielded to the gradually increasing but irresistible
      influence of those innumerable associations, which, under classic names, or affecting to be
      the junior branches of celebrated confederacies, have since secured to the million, at cost
      price, all the delicacies of the season, and substituted for the zealous energy of immortal
      JOES the inexorable but frigid discipline of managing committees.</p>
     <p>“You are our guest to-day,” said Mr. Trenchard to Endymion. “Do not be embarrassed. It is a
      custom with us, but not a ruinous one. We dine off the joint, but the meat is first-rate, and
      you may have as much as you like, and our tipple is half-and-half. Perhaps you do not know it.
      Let me drink to your health.”</p>
     <p>They ate most heartily; but when their well-earned meal was despatched, their conversation,
      assisted by a moderate portion of some celebrated toddy, became animated, various, and
      interesting. Endymion was highly amused; but being a stranger, and the youngest present, his
      silence was not unbecoming, and his manner indicated that it was not occasioned by want of
      sympathy. The talk was very political. They were all what are called Liberals, having all of
      them received their appointments since the catastrophe of 1830; but the shades in the colour
      of their opinions were various and strong. Jawett was uncompromising; ruthlessly logical, his
      principles being clear, he was for what he called “carrying them out” to their just
      conclusions. Trenchard, on the contrary, thought everything ought to be a compromise, and that
      a public man ceased to be practical the moment he was logical. St. Barbe believed that
      literature and the arts, and intellect generally, had as little to hope for from one party as
      from the other; while Seymour Hicks was of opinion that the Tories never would rally, owing to
      their deficiency in social influences. Seymour Hicks sometimes got an invitation to a
      ministerial soiree.</p>
     <p>The vote of the House of Commons in favour of an appropriation of the surplus revenues of
      the Irish Church to the purposes of secular education—a vote which had just changed the
      government and expelled the Tories—was much discussed. Jawett denounced it as a miserable
      subterfuge, but with a mildness of manner and a mincing expression, which amusingly contrasted
      with the violence of his principles and the strength of his language.</p>
     <p>“The whole of the revenues of the Protestant Church should be at once appropriated to
      secular education, or to some other purpose of general utility,” he said. “And it must come to
      this.”</p>
     <p>Trenchard thought the ministry had gone as far in this matter as they well could, and
      Seymour Hicks remarked that any government which systematically attacked the Church would have
      “society” against it. Endymion, who felt very nervous, but who on Church questions had strong
      convictions, ventured to ask why the Church should be deprived of its property.</p>
     <p>“In the case of Ireland,” replied Jawett, quite in a tone of conciliatory condescension,
      “because it does not fulfil the purpose for which it was endowed. It has got the property of
      the nation, and it is not the Church of the people. But I go further than that. I would
      disendow every Church. They are not productive institutions. There is no reason why they
      should exist. There is no use in them.”</p>
     <p>“No use in the Church!” said Endymion, reddening; but Mr. Trenchard, who had tact, here
      interfered, and said, “I told you our friend Jawett is a great Radical; but he is in a
      minority among us on these matters. Everybody, however, says what he likes at Joe’s.”</p>
     <p>Then they talked of theatres, and critically discussed the articles in the daily papers and
      the last new book, and there was much discussion respecting a contemplated subscription boat;
      but still, in general, it was remarkable how they relapsed into their favourite
      subject—speculation upon men in office, both permanent and parliamentary, upon their
      characters and capacity, their habits and tempers. One was a good administrator, another did
      nothing; one had no detail, another too much; one was a screw, another a spendthrift; this man
      could make a set speech, but could not reply; his rival, capital at a reply but clumsy in a
      formal oration.</p>
     <p>At this time London was a very dull city, instead of being, as it is now, a very amusing
      one. Probably there never was a city in the world, with so vast a population, which was so
      melancholy. The aristocracy probably have always found amusements adapted to the manners of
      the time and the age in which they lived. The middle classes, half a century ago, had little
      distraction from their monotonous toil and melancholy anxieties, except, perhaps, what they
      found in religious and philanthropic societies. Their general life must have been very dull.
      Some traditionary merriment always lingered among the working classes of England. Both in town
      and country they had always their games and fairs and junketing parties, which have developed
      into excursion trains and colossal pic-nics. But of all classes of the community, in the days
      of our fathers, there was none so unfortunate in respect of public amusements as the bachelors
      about town. There were, one might almost say, only two theatres, and they so huge, that it was
      difficult to see or hear in either. Their monopolies, no longer redeemed by the stately genius
      of the Kembles, the pathos of Miss O’Neill, or the fiery passion of Kean, were already
      menaced, and were soon about to fall; but the crowd of diminutive but sparkling substitutes,
      which have since taken their place, had not yet appeared, and half-price at Drury Lane or
      Covent Garden was a dreary distraction after a morning of desk work. There were no Alhambras
      then, and no Cremornes, no palaces of crystal in terraced gardens, no casinos, no music-halls,
      no aquaria, no promenade concerts. Evans’ existed, but not in the fulness of its modern
      development; and the most popular place of resort was the barbarous conviviality of the Cider
      Cellar.</p>
     <p>Mr. Trenchard had paid the bill, collected his quotas and rewarded the waiter, and then, as
      they all rose, said to Endymion, “We are going to the Divan. Do you smoke?”</p>
     <p>Endymion shook his head; but Trenchard added, “Well, you will some day; but you had better
      come with us. You need not smoke; you can order a cup of coffee, and then you may read all the
      newspapers and magazines. It is a nice lounge.”</p>
     <p>So, emerging from Naseby Street into the Strand, they soon entered a tobacconist’s shop, and
      passing through it were admitted into a capacious saloon, well lit and fitted up with low,
      broad sofas, fixed against the walls, and on which were seated, or reclining, many persons,
      chiefly smoking cigars, but some few practising with the hookah and other oriental modes. In
      the centre of the room was a table covered with newspapers and publications of that class. The
      companions from Joe’s became separated after their entrance, and St. Barbe, addressing
      Endymion, said, “I am not inclined to smoke to-day. We will order some coffee, and you will
      find some amusement in this;” and he placed in his hands a number of “SCARAMOUCH.”</p>
     <p>“I hope you will like your new life,” said St. Barbe, throwing down a review on the Divan,
      and leaning back sipping his coffee. “One thing may be said in favour of it: you will work
      with a body of as true-hearted comrades as ever existed. They are always ready to assist one.
      Thorough good-natured fellows, that I will say for them. I suppose it is adversity,” he
      continued, “that develops the kindly qualities of our nature. I believe the sense of common
      degradation has a tendency to make the degraded amiable—at least among themselves. I am told
      it is found so in the plantations in slave-gangs.”</p>
     <p>“But I hope we are not a slave-gang,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“It is horrible to think of gentlemen, and men of education, and perhaps first-rate
      talents—who knows?—reduced to our straits,” said St. Barbe. “I do not follow Jawett in all his
      views, for I hate political economy, and never could understand it; and he gives it you pure
      and simple, eh? eh?—but, I say, it is something awful to think of the incomes that some men
      are making, who could no more write an article in ‘SCARAMOUCH’ than fly.”</p>
     <p>“But our incomes may improve,” said Endymion. “I was told to-day that promotion was even
      rapid in our office.”</p>
     <p>“Our incomes may improve when we are bent and grey,” said St. Barbe, “and we may even retire
      on a pension about as good as a nobleman leaves to his valet. Oh, it is a horrid world! Your
      father is a privy councillor, is not he?”</p>
     <p>“Yes, and so was my grandfather, but I do not think I shall ever be one.”</p>
     <p>“It is a great thing to have a father a privy councillor,” said St. Barbe, with a glance of
      envy. “If I were the son of a privy councillor, those demons, Shuffle and Screw, would give me
      500 pounds for my novel, which now they put in their beastly magazine and print in small type,
      and do not pay me so much as a powdered flunkey has in St. James’ Square. I agree with Jawett:
      the whole thing is rotten.”</p>
     <p>“Mr. Jawett seems to have very strange opinions,” said Endymion. “I did not like to hear
      what he said at dinner about the Church, but Mr. Trenchard turned the conversation, and I
      thought it best to let it pass.”</p>
     <p>“Trenchard is a sensible man, and a good fellow,” said St. Barbe; “you like him?”</p>
     <p>“I find him kind.”</p>
     <p>“Do you know,” said St. Barbe, in a whisper, and with a distressed and almost vindictive
      expression of countenance, “that man may come any day into four thousand a year. There is only
      one life between him and the present owner. I believe it is a good life,” he added, in a more
      cheerful voice, “but still it might happen. Is it not horrible? Four thousand a year!
      Trenchard with four thousand a year, and we receiving little more than the pay of a
      butler!”</p>
     <p>“Well, I wish, for his sake, he might have it,” said Endymion, “though I might lose a kind
      friend.”</p>
     <p>“Look at Seymour Hicks,” said St. Barbe; “he has smoked his cigar, and he is going. He never
      remains. He is going to a party, I’ll be found. That fellow gets about in a most extraordinary
      manner. Is it not disgusting? I doubt whether he is asked much to dinner though, or I think we
      should have heard of it. Nevertheless, Trenchard said the other day that Hicks had dined with
      Lord Cinque-Ports. I can hardly believe it; it would be too disgusting. No lord ever asked me
      to dinner. But the aristocracy of this country are doomed!”</p>
     <p>“Mr. Hicks,” said Endymion, “probably lays himself out for society.”</p>
     <p>“I suppose you will,” said St. Barbe, with a scrutinising air. “I should if I were the son
      of a privy councillor. Hicks is nothing; his father kept a stable-yard and his mother was an
      actress. We have had several dignitaries of the Church in my family and one admiral. And yet
      Hicks dines with Lord Cinque-Ports! It is positively revolting! But the things he does to get
      asked!—sings, rants, conjures, ventriloquises, mimics, stands on his head. His great
      performance is a parliamentary debate. We will make him do it for you. And yet with all this a
      dull dog—a very dull dog, sir. He wrote for ‘Scaramouch’ some little time, but they can stand
      it no more. Between you and me, he has had notice to quit. That I know; and he will probably
      get the letter when he goes home from his party to-night. So much for success in society! I
      shall now say good-night to you.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
     <p>It was only ten o’clock when Endymion returned to Warwick Street, and for the first time in
      his life used a pass-key, with which Mr. Rodney had furnished him in the morning, and
      re-entered his new home. He thought he had used it very quietly, and was lighting his candle
      and about to steal up to his lofty heights, when from the door of the parlour, which opened
      into the passage, emerged Miss Imogene, who took the candlestick from his hand and insisted on
      waiting upon him.</p>
     <p>“I thought I heard something,” she said; “you must let me light you up, for you can hardly
      yet know your way. I must see too if all is right; you may want something.”</p>
     <p>So she tripped up lightly before him, showing, doubtless without premeditation, as
      well-turned an ankle and as pretty a foot as could fall to a damsel’s fortunate lot. “My
      sister and Mr. Rodney have gone to the play,” she said, “but they left strict instructions
      with me to see that you were comfortable, and that you wanted for nothing that we could
      supply.”</p>
     <p>“You are too kind,” said Endymion, as she lighted the candles on his dressing-table, “and,
      to tell you the truth, these are luxuries I am not accustomed to, and to which I am not
      entitled.”</p>
     <p>“And yet,” she said, with a glance of blended admiration and pity, “they tell me time was
      when gold was not good enough for you, and I do not think it could be.”</p>
     <p>“Such kindness as this,” said Endymion, “is more precious than gold.”</p>
     <p>“I hope you will find your things well arranged. All your clothes are in these two drawers;
      the coats in the bottom one, and your linen in those above. You will not perhaps be able to
      find your pocket-handkerchiefs at first. They are in this sachet; my sister made it herself.
      Mr. Rodney says you are to be called at eight o’clock and breakfast at nine. I think
      everything is right. Good-night, Mr. Endymion.”</p>
     <p>The Rodney household was rather a strange one. The first two floors, as we have mentioned,
      were let, and at expensive rates, for the apartments were capacious and capitally furnished,
      and the situation, if not distinguished, was extremely convenient—quiet from not being a
      thoroughfare, and in the heart of civilisation. They only kept a couple of servants, but their
      principal lodgers had their personal attendants. And yet after sunset the sisters appeared and
      presided at their tea-table, always exquisitely dressed; seldom alone, for Mr. Rodney had many
      friends, and lived in a capacious apartment, rather finely furnished, with a round table
      covered with gaudy print-books, a mantelpiece crowded with vases of mock Dresden, and a
      cottage piano, on which Imogene could accompany her more than pleasing voice.</p>
     <p>Somehow or other, the process is difficult to trace, Endymion not unfrequently found himself
      at Mrs. Rodney’s tea-table. On the first occasion or so, he felt himself a little shy and
      embarrassed, but it soon became natural to him, and he would often escape from the symposia at
      Joe’s, and, instead of the Divan, find in Warwick Street a more congenial scene. There were
      generally some young men there, who seemed delighted with the ladies, listened with enthusiasm
      to Imogene’s singing, and were allowed to smoke. They were evidently gentlemen, and indeed Mr.
      Rodney casually mentioned to Endymion that one of the most frequent guests might some day even
      be a peer of the realm. Sometimes there was a rubber of whist, and, if wanted, Mrs. Rodney
      took a hand in it; Endymion sitting apart and conversing with her sister, who amused him by
      her lively observations, indicating even flashes of culture; but always addressed him without
      the slightest pretence and with the utmost naturalness. This was not the case with Mr. Rodney;
      pretence with him was ingrained, and he was at first somewhat embarrassed by the presence of
      Endymion, as he could hardly maintain before his late patron’s son his favourite character of
      the aristocratic victim of revolution. And yet this drawback was more than counterbalanced by
      the gratification of his vanity in finding a Ferrars his habitual guest. Such a luxury seemed
      a dangerous indulgence, but he could not resist it, and the moth was always flying round the
      candle. There was no danger, however, and that Mr. Rodney soon found out. Endymion was born
      with tact, and it came to him as much from goodness of heart as fineness of taste. Mr. Rodney,
      therefore, soon resumed his anecdotes of great men and his personal experience of their
      sayings, manners, and customs, with which he was in the habit of enlivening or ornamenting the
      whist table; occasionally introducing Endymion to the notice of the table by mentioning in a
      low tone, “That is Mr. Ferrars, in a certain sense under my care; his father is a privy
      councillor, and had it not been for the revolution—for I maintain, and always will, the Reform
      Bill was neither more nor less than a revolution—would probably have been Prime Minister. He
      was my earliest and my best friend.”</p>
     <p>When there were cards, there was always a little supper: a lobster and a roasted potato and
      that sort of easy thing, and curious drinks, which the sisters mixed and made, and which no
      one else, at least all said so, could mix and make. On fitting occasions a bottle of champagne
      appeared, and then the person for whom the wine was produced was sure with wonderment to say,
      “Where did you get this champagne, Rodney? Could you get me some?” Mr. Rodney shook his head
      and scarcely gave a hope, but subsequently, when the praise in consequence had continued and
      increased, would observe, “Do you really want some? I cannot promise, but I will try. Of
      course they will ask a high figure.”</p>
     <p>“Anything they like, my dear Rodney.”</p>
     <p>And in about a week’s time the gentleman was so fortunate as to get his champagne.</p>
     <p>There was one subject in which Mr. Rodney appeared to be particularly interested, and that
      was racing. The turf at that time had not developed into that vast institution of national
      demoralisation which it now exhibits. That disastrous character may be mainly attributed to
      the determination of our legislators to put down gaming-houses, which, practically speaking,
      substituted for the pernicious folly of a comparatively limited class the ruinous madness of
      the community. There were many influences by which in the highest classes persons might be
      discouraged or deterred from play under a roof; and in the great majority of cases such a
      habit was difficult, not to say impossible, to indulge. But in shutting up gaming-houses, we
      brought the gaming-table into the street, and its practices became the pursuit of those who
      would otherwise have never witnessed or even thought of them. No doubt Crockford’s had its
      tragedies, but all its disasters and calamities together would hardly equal a lustre of the
      ruthless havoc which has ensued from its suppression.</p>
     <p>Nevertheless, in 1835 men made books, and Mr. Rodney was not inexpert in a composition which
      requires no ordinary qualities of character and intelligence; method, judgment,
      self-restraint, not too much imagination, perception of character, and powers of calculation.
      All these qualities were now in active demand and exercise; for the Derby was at hand, and the
      Rodney family, deeply interested in the result, were to attend the celebrated festival.</p>
     <p>One of the young gentlemen, who sometimes smoked a cigar and sometimes tasted a lobster in
      their parlour, and who seemed alike and equally devoted to Mrs. Rodney and her sister,
      insisted upon taking them to Epsom in his drag, and they themselves were to select the party
      to accompany them. That was not difficult, for they were naturally all friends of their
      munificent host with one exception. Imogene stipulated that Endymion should be asked, and Mr.
      Rodney supported the suggestion. “He is the son of the privy councillor the Right Hon. William
      Pitt Ferrars, my earliest and my best friend, and in a certain sense is under my care.”</p>
     <p>The drive to the Derby was not then shorn of its humours and glories. It was the Carnival of
      England, with equipages as numerous and various, and with banter not less quick and witty. It
      was a bright day—a day, no doubt, of wild hopes and terrible fears, but yet, on the whole, of
      joy and exultation. And no one was happier and prouder than pretty Mrs. Rodney, exquisitely
      dressed and sitting on the box of a patrician drag, beside its noble owner. On the seat behind
      them was Imogene, with Endymion on one side, and on the other the individual “who might one
      day be a peer.” Mr. Rodney and some others, including Mr. Vigo, faced a couple of grooms, who
      sat with folded arms and unmoved countenances, fastidiously stolid amid all the fun, and grave
      even when they opened the champagne.</p>
     <p>The right horse won. Mr. Rodney and his friends pocketed a good stake, and they demolished
      their luncheon of luxuries with frantic gaiety.</p>
     <p>“It is almost as happy as our little suppers in Warwick Street,” whispered their noble
      driver to his companion.</p>
     <p>“Oh! much more than anything you can find there,” simpered Mrs. Rodney.</p>
     <p>“I declare to you, some of the happiest hours of my life have been passed in Warwick
      Street,” gravely murmured her friend.</p>
     <p>“I wish I could believe that,” said Mrs. Rodney.</p>
     <p>As for Endymion, he enjoyed himself amazingly. The whole scene was new to him—he had never
      been at a race before, and this was the most famous of races. He did not know he had betted,
      but he found he too had won a little money, Mr. Rodney having put him on something, though
      what that meant he had not the remotest idea. Imogene, however, assured him it was all
      right—Mr. Rodney constantly put her on something. He enjoyed the luncheon too; the cold
      chicken, and the French pies, the wondrous salads, and the iced champagne. It seemed that
      Imogene was always taking care that his plate or his glass should be filled. Everything was
      delightful, and his noble host, who, always courteous, had hitherto been reserved, called him
      “Ferrars.”</p>
     <p>What with the fineness of the weather, the inspirations of the excited and countless
      multitude, the divine stimulus of the luncheon, the kindness of his charming companions, and
      the general feeling of enjoyment and success that seemed to pervade his being, Endymion felt
      as he were almost acting a distinguished part in some grand triumph of antiquity, as returning
      home, the four splendid dark chestnuts swept along, two of their gay company playing bugles,
      and the grooms sitting with folded arms of haughty indifference.</p>
     <p>Just at this moment his eye fell upon an omnibus full, inside and out, of clerks in his
      office. There was a momentary stoppage, and while he returned the salute of several of them,
      his quick eye could not avoid recognising the slightly surprised glance of Trenchard, the
      curious amazement of Seymour Hicks, and the indignant astonishment of St. Barbe.</p>
     <p>“Our friend Ferrars seems in tiptop company,” said Trenchard.</p>
     <p>“That may have been a countess on the box,” said Seymour Hicks, “for I observed an earl’s
      coronet on the drag. I cannot make out who it is.”</p>
     <p>“There is no more advantage in going with four horses than with two,” said St. Barbe;
      “indeed, I believe you go slower. It is mere pride; puffed-up vanity. I should like to send
      those two grooms with their folded arms to the galleys—I hate those fellows. For my part, I
      never was behind four horses except in a stage-coach. No peer of the realm ever took me on his
      drag. However, a day of reckoning will come; the people won’t stand this much longer.”</p>
     <p>Jawett was not there, for he disapproved of races.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>
     <p>Endymion had to encounter a rather sharp volley when he went to the office next morning.
      After some general remarks as to the distinguished party which he had accompanied to the
      races, Seymour Hicks could not resist inquiring, though with some circumlocution, whether the
      lady was a countess. The lady was not a countess. Who was the lady? The lady was Mrs. Rodney.
      Who was Mrs. Rodney? She was the wife of Mr. Rodney, who accompanied her. Was Mr. Rodney a
      relation of Lord Rodney? Endymion believed he was not a relation of Lord Rodney. Who was Mr.
      Rodney then?</p>
     <p>“Mr. Rodney is an old friend of my father.”</p>
     <p>This natural solution of doubts and difficulties arrested all further inquiry. Generally
      speaking, the position of Endymion in his new life was satisfactory. He was regular and
      assiduous in his attendance at office, was popular with his comrades, and was cherished by his
      chief, who had even invited him to dinner. His duties were certainly at present mechanical,
      but they were associated with an interesting profession; and humble as was his lot, he began
      to feel the pride of public life. He continued to be a regular guest at Joe’s, and was careful
      not to seem to avoid the society of his fellow-clerks in the evenings, for he had an
      instinctive feeling that it was as well they should not become acquainted with his circle in
      Warwick Street. And yet to him the attractions of that circle became daily more difficult to
      resist. And often when he was enduring the purgatory of the Divan, listening to the snarls of
      St. Barbe over the shameful prosperity of everybody in this world except the snarler, or
      perhaps went half-price to the pit of Drury Lane with the critical Trenchard, he was, in
      truth, restless and absent, and his mind was in another place, indulging in visions which he
      did not care to analyse, but which were very agreeable.</p>
     <p>One evening, shortly after the expedition to Epsom, while the rest were playing a rubber,
      Imogene said to him, “I wish you to be friends with Mr. Vigo; I think he might be of use to
      you.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Vigo was playing whist at this moment; his partner was Sylvia, and they were playing
      against Mr. Rodney and Waldershare.</p>
     <p>Waldershare was a tenant of the second floor. He was the young gentleman “who might some day
      be a peer.” He was a young man of about three or four and twenty years; fair, with short curly
      brown hair and blue eyes; not exactly handsome, but with a countenance full of expression, and
      the index of quick emotions, whether of joy or of anger. Waldershare was the only child of a
      younger son of a patrician house, and had inherited from his father a moderate but easy
      fortune. He had been the earliest lodger of the Rodneys, and, taking advantage of the Tory
      reaction, had just been returned to the House of Commons.</p>
     <p>What he would do there was a subject of interesting speculation to his numerous friends, and
      it may be said admirers. Waldershare was one of those vivid and brilliant organisations which
      exercise a peculiarly attractive influence on youth. He had been the hero of the debating club
      at Cambridge, and many believed in consequence that he must become prime minister. He was
      witty and fanciful, and, though capricious and bad-tempered, could flatter and caress. At
      Cambridge he had introduced the new Oxford heresy, of which Nigel Penruddock was a votary.
      Waldershare prayed and fasted, and swore by Laud and Strafford. He took, however, a more
      eminent degree at Paris than at his original Alma Mater, and becoming passionately addicted to
      French literature, his views respecting both Church and State became modified—at least in
      private. His entrance into English society had been highly successful, and as he had a due
      share of vanity, and was by no means free from worldliness, he had enjoyed and pursued his
      triumphs. But his versatile nature, which required not only constant, but novel excitement,
      became palled, even with the society of duchesses. There was a monotony in the splendour of
      aristocratic life which wearied him, and for some time he had persuaded himself that the only
      people who understood the secret of existence were the family under whose roof he lodged.</p>
     <p>Waldershare was profligate, but sentimental; unprincipled, but romantic; the child of whim,
      and the slave of an imagination so freakish and deceptive, that it was always impossible to
      foretell his course. He was alike capable of sacrificing all his feelings to worldly
      considerations or of forfeiting the world for a visionary caprice. At present his favourite
      scheme, and one to which he seemed really attached, was to educate Imogene. Under his tuition
      he had persuaded himself that she would turn out what he styled “a great woman.” An age of
      vast change, according to Waldershare, was impending over us. There was no male career in
      which one could confide. Most men of mark would probably be victims, but “a great woman” must
      always make her way. Whatever the circumstances, she would adapt herself to them; if
      necessary, would mould and fashion them. His dream was that Imogene should go forth and
      conquer the world, and that in the sunset of life he should find a refuge in some corner of
      her palace.</p>
     <p>Imogene was only a child when Waldershare first became a lodger. She used to bring his
      breakfast to his drawing-room and arrange his table. He encountered her one day, and he
      requested her to remain, and always preside over his meal. He fell in love with her name, and
      wrote her a series of sonnets, idealising her past, panegyrising her present, and prophetic of
      her future life. Imogene, who was neither shy nor obtrusive, was calm amid all his vagaries,
      humoured his fancies, even when she did not understand them, and read his verses as she would
      a foreign language which she was determined to master.</p>
     <p>Her culture, according to Waldershare, was to be carried on chiefly by conversations. She
      was not to read, or at least not to read much, until her taste was formed and she had acquired
      the due share of previous knowledge necessary to profitable study. As Waldershare was
      eloquent, brilliant, and witty, Imogene listened to him with wondering interest and amusement,
      even when she found some difficulty in following him; but her apprehension was so quick and
      her tact so fine, that her progress, though she was almost unconscious of it, was remarkable.
      Sometimes in the evening, while the others were smoking together or playing whist, Waldershare
      and Imogene, sitting apart, were engaged in apparently the most interesting converse. It was
      impossible not to observe the animation and earnestness of Waldershare, and the great
      attention with which his companion responded to his representations. Yet all this time he was
      only giving her a lecture on Madame de Sevigne.</p>
     <p>Waldershare used to take Imogene to the National Gallery and Hampton Court, and other
      delightful scenes of popular education, but of late Mrs. Rodney had informed her sister that
      she was no longer young enough to permit these expeditions. Imogene accepted the announcement
      without a murmur, but it occasioned Waldershare several sonnets of heartrending remonstrance.
      Imogene continued, however, to make his breakfast, and kept his Parliamentary papers in order,
      which he never could manage, but the mysteries of which Imogene mastered with feminine
      quickness and precision. Whenever Waldershare was away he always maintained a constant
      correspondence with Imogene. In this he communicated everything to her without the slightest
      reserve; describing everything he saw, almost everything he heard, pages teeming with
      anecdotes of a world of which she could know nothing—the secrets of courts and coteries,
      memoirs of princes and ministers, of dandies and dames of fashion. “If anything happens to
      me,” Waldershare would say to Imogene, “this correspondence may be worth thousands to you, and
      when it is published it will connect your name with mine, and assist my grand idea of your
      becoming ‘a great woman.’”</p>
     <p>“But I do not know Mr. Vigo,” whispered Endymion to Imogene.</p>
     <p>“But you have met him here, and you went together to Epsom. It is enough. He is going to ask
      you to dine with him on Saturday. We shall be there, and Mr. Waldershare is going. He has a
      beautiful place, and it will be very pleasant.” And exactly as Imogene had anticipated, Mr.
      Vigo, in the course of the evening, did ask Endymion to do him the honour of being his
      guest.</p>
     <p>The villa of Mr. Vigo was on the banks of the Thames, and had once belonged to a noble
      customer. The Palladian mansion contained a suite of chambers of majestic dimensions—lofty
      ceilings, rich cornices, and vast windows of plate glass; the gardens were rich with the
      products of conservatories which Mr. Vigo had raised with every modern improvement, and a
      group of stately cedars supported the dignity of the scene and gave to it a name. Beyond, a
      winding walk encircled a large field which Mr. Vigo called the park, and which sparkled with
      gold and silver pheasants, and the keeper lived in a newly-raised habitation at the extreme
      end, which took the form of a Swiss cottage.</p>
     <p>The Rodney family, accompanied by Mr. Waldershare and Endymion, went to the Cedars by water.
      It was a delightful afternoon of June, the river warm and still, and the soft, fitful western
      breeze occasionally rich with the perfume of the gardens of Putney and Chiswick. Waldershare
      talked the whole way. It was a rhapsody of fancy, fun, knowledge, anecdote, brilliant
      badinage—even passionate seriousness. Sometimes he recited poetry, and his voice was musical;
      and, then, when he had attuned his companions to a sentimental pitch, he would break into
      mockery, and touch with delicate satire every mood of human feeling. Endymion listened to him
      in silence and admiration. He had never heard Waldershare talk before, and he had never heard
      anybody like him. All this time, what was now, and ever, remarkable in Waldershare were his
      manners. They were finished, even to courtliness. Affable and winning, he was never familiar.
      He always addressed Sylvia as if she were one of those duchesses round whom he used to linger.
      He would bow deferentially to her remarks, and elicit from some of her casual observations an
      acute or graceful meaning, of which she herself was by no means conscious. The bow of
      Waldershare was a study. Its grace and ceremony must have been organic; for there was no
      traditionary type in existence from which he could have derived or inherited it. He certainly
      addressed Imogene and spoke to her by her Christian name; but this was partly because he was
      in love with the name, and partly because he would persist in still treating her as a child.
      But his manner to her always was that of tender respect. She was almost as silent as Endymion
      during their voyage, but not less attentive to her friend. Mr. Rodney was generally silent,
      and never opened his mouth on this occasion except in answer to an inquiry from his wife as to
      whom a villa might belong, and it seemed always that he knew every villa, and every one to
      whom they belonged.</p>
     <p>The sisters were in demi-toilette, which seemed artless, though in fact it was profoundly
      devised. Sylvia was the only person who really understood the meaning of “simplex munditiis,”
      and this was one of the secrets of her success. There were some ladies, on the lawn of the
      Cedars when they arrived, not exactly of their school, and who were finely and fully dressed.
      Mrs. Gamme was the wife of a sporting attorney of Mr. Vigo, and who also, having a villa at
      hand, was looked upon as a country neighbour. Mrs. Gamme was universally recognised to be a
      fine woman, and she dressed up to her reputation. She was a famous whist-player at high
      points, and dealt the cards with hands covered with diamond rings. Another country neighbour
      was the chief partner in the celebrated firm of Hooghley, Dacca, and Co., dealers in Indian
      and other shawls. Mr. Hooghley had married a celebrated actress, and was proud and a little
      jealous of his wife. Mrs. Hooghley had always an opportunity at the Cedars of meeting some
      friends in her former profession, for Mr. Vigo liked to be surrounded by genius and art. “I
      must have talent,” he would exclaim, as he looked round at the amusing and motley multitude
      assembled at his splendid entertainments. And to-day upon his lawn might be observed the first
      tenor of the opera and a prima-donna who had just arrived, several celebrated members of the
      English stage of both sexes, artists of great reputation, whose principal works already
      adorned the well-selected walls of the Cedars, a danseuse or two of celebrity, some literary
      men, as Mr. Vigo styled them, who were chiefly brethren of the political press, and more than
      one member of either House of Parliament.</p>
     <p>Just as the party were preparing to leave the lawn and enter the dining-room arrived,
      breathless and glowing, the young earl who had driven the Rodneys to the Derby.</p>
     <p>“A shaver, my dear Vigo! Only returned to town this afternoon, and found your invitation.
      How fortunate!” And then he looked around, and recognising Mrs. Rodney, was immediately at her
      side. “I must have the honour of taking you into dinner. I got your note, but only by this
      morning’s post.”</p>
     <p>The dinner was a banquet,—a choice bouquet before every guest, turtle and venison and piles
      of whitebait, and pine-apples of prodigious size, and bunches of grapes that had gained
      prizes. The champagne seemed to flow in fountains, and was only interrupted that the guests
      might quaff Burgundy or taste Tokay. But what was more delightful than all was the enjoyment
      of all present, and especially of their host. That is a rare sight. Banquets are not rare, nor
      choice guests, nor gracious hosts; but when do we ever see a person enjoy anything? But these
      gay children of art and whim, and successful labour and happy speculation, some of them very
      rich and some of them without a sou, seemed only to think of the festive hour and all its
      joys. Neither wealth nor poverty brought them cares. Every face sparkled, every word seemed
      witty, and every sound seemed sweet. A band played upon the lawn during the dinner, and were
      succeeded, when the dessert commenced, by strange choruses from singers of some foreign land,
      who for the first time aired their picturesque costumes on the banks of the Thames.</p>
     <p>When the ladies had withdrawn to the saloon, the first comic singer of the age excelled
      himself; and when they rejoined their fair friends, the primo-tenore and the prima-donna gave
      them a grand scene, succeeded by the English performers in a favourite scene from a famous
      farce. Then Mrs. Gamme had an opportunity of dealing with her diamond rings, and the rest
      danced—a waltz of whirling grace, or merry cotillon of jocund bouquets.</p>
     <p>“Well, Clarence,” said Waldershare to the young earl, as they stood for a moment apart, “was
      I right?”</p>
     <p>“By Jove! yes. It is the only life. You were quite right. We should indeed be fools to
      sacrifice ourselves to the conventional.”</p>
     <p>The Rodney party returned home in the drag of the last speaker. They were the last to
      retire, as Mr. Vigo wished for one cigar with his noble friend. As he bade farewell, and
      cordially, to Endymion, he said, “Call on me to-morrow morning in Burlington Street in your
      way to your office. Do not mind the hour. I am an early bird.”</p>
    </div>

     <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
     <p>“It is no favour,” said Mr. Vigo; “it is not even an act of friendliness; it is a freak, and
      it is my freak; the favour, if there be one, is conferred by you.”</p>
     <p>“But I really do not know what to say,” said Endymion, hesitating and confused.</p>
     <p>“I am not a classical scholar,” said Mr. Vigo, “but there are two things which I think I
      understand—men and horses. I like to back them both when I think they ought to win.”</p>
     <p>“But I am scarcely a man,” said Endymion, rather piteously, “and I sometimes think I shall
      never win anything.”</p>
     <p>“That is my affair,” replied Mr. Vigo; “you are a yearling, and I have formed my judgment as
      to your capacity. What I wish to do in your case is what I have done in others, and some
      memorable ones. Dress does not make a man, but it often makes a successful one. The most
      precious stone, you know, must be cut and polished. I shall enter your name in my books for an
      unlimited credit, and no account to be settled till you are a privy councillor. I do not limit
      the credit, because you are a man of sense and a gentleman, and will not abuse it. But be
      quite as careful not to stint yourself as not to be needlessly extravagant. In the first
      instance, you would be interfering with my experiment, and that would not be fair.”</p>
     <p>This conversation took place in Mr. Vigo’s counting-house the morning after the
      entertainment at his villa. Endymion called upon Mr. Vigo in his way to his office, as he had
      been requested to do, and Mr. Vigo had expressed his wishes and intentions with regard to
      Endymion, as intimated in the preceding remarks.</p>
     <p>“I have known many an heiress lost by her suitor being ill-dressed,” said Mr. Vigo. “You
      must dress according to your age, your pursuits, your object in life; you must dress too, in
      some cases, according to your set. In youth a little fancy is rather expected, but if
      political life be your object, it should be avoided, at least after one-and-twenty. I am
      dressing two brothers now, men of considerable position; one is a mere man of pleasure, the
      other will probably be a minister of state. They are as like as two peas, but were I to dress
      the dandy and the minister the same, it would be bad taste—it would be ridiculous. No man
      gives me the trouble which Lord Eglantine does; he has not made up his mind whether he will be
      a great poet or prime minister. ‘You must choose, my lord,’ I tell him. ‘I cannot send you out
      looking like Lord Byron if you mean to be a Canning or a Pitt.’ I have dressed a great many of
      our statesmen and orators, and I always dressed them according to their style and the nature
      of their duties. What all men should avoid is the ‘shabby genteel.’ No man ever gets over it.
      I will save you from that. You had better be in rags.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXIV</head>
     <p>When the twins had separated, they had resolved on a system of communication which had been,
      at least on the part of Myra, scrupulously maintained. They were to interchange letters every
      week, and each letter was to assume, if possible, the shape of a journal, so that when they
      again met no portion of the interval should be a blank in their past lives. There were few
      incidents in the existence of Myra; a book, a walk, a visit to the rectory, were among the
      chief. The occupations of their father were unchanged, and his health seemed sustained, but
      that of her mother was not satisfactory. Mrs. Ferrars had never rallied since the last
      discomfiture of her political hopes, and had never resumed her previous tenour of life. She
      was secluded, her spirits uncertain, moods of depression succeeded by fits of unaccountable
      excitement, and, on the whole, Myra feared a general and chronic disturbance of her nervous
      system. His sister prepared Endymion for encountering a great change in their parent when he
      returned home. Myra, however, never expatiated on the affairs of Hurstley. Her annals in this
      respect were somewhat dry. She fulfilled her promise of recording them, but no more. Her pen
      was fuller and more eloquent in her comments on the life of her brother, and of the new
      characters with whom he had become acquainted. She delighted to hear about Mr. Jawett, and
      especially about Mr. St. Barbe, and was much pleased that he had been to the Derby, though she
      did not exactly collect who were his companions. Did he go with that kind Mr. Trenchant? It
      would seem that Endymion’s account of the Rodney family had been limited to vague though
      earnest acknowledgments of their great civility and attention, which added much to the comfort
      of his life. Impelled by some of these grateful though general remarks, Mrs. Ferrars, in a
      paroxysm of stately gratitude, had sent a missive to Sylvia, such as a sovereign might address
      to a deserving subject, at the same time acknowledging and commending her duteous services.
      Such was the old domestic superstition of the Rodneys, that, with all their worldliness, they
      treasured this effusion as if it had really emanated from the centre of power and courtly
      favour.</p>
     <p>Myra, in her anticipation of speedily meeting her brother, was doomed to disappointment. She
      had counted on Endymion obtaining some holidays in the usual recess, but in consequence of
      having so recently joined the office, Endymion was retained for summer and autumnal work, and
      not until Christmas was there any prospect of his returning home.</p>
     <p>The interval between midsummer and that period, though not devoid of seasons of monotony and
      loneliness, passed in a way not altogether unprofitable to Endymion. Waldershare, who had
      begun to notice him, seemed to become interested in his career. Waldershare knew all about his
      historic ancestor, Endymion Carey. The bubbling imagination of Waldershare clustered with a
      sort of wild fascination round a living link with the age of the cavaliers. He had some Stuart
      blood in his veins, and his ancestors had fallen at Edgehill and Marston Moor. Waldershare,
      whose fancies alternated between Stafford and St. Just, Archbishop Laud and the Goddess of
      Reason, reverted for the moment to his visions on the banks of the Cam, and the brilliant
      rhapsodies of his boyhood. His converse with Nigel Penruddock had prepared Endymion in some
      degree for these mysteries, and perhaps it was because Waldershare found that Endymion was by
      no means ill-informed on these matters, and therefore there was less opportunity of dazzling
      and moulding him, which was a passion with Waldershare, that he soon quitted the Great
      Rebellion for pastures new, and impressed upon his pupil that all that had occurred before the
      French Revolution was ancient history. The French Revolution had introduced the cosmopolitan
      principle into human affairs instead of the national, and no public man could succeed who did
      not comprehend and acknowledge that truth. Waldershare lent Endymion books, and books with
      which otherwise he would not have become acquainted. Unconsciously to himself, the talk of
      Waldershare, teeming with knowledge, and fancy, and playfulness, and airy sarcasm of life,
      taught him something of the art of conversation—to be prompt without being stubborn, to refute
      without argument, and to clothe grave matters in a motley garb.</p>
     <p>But in August Waldershare disappeared, and at the beginning of September, even the Rodneys
      had gone to Margate. St. Barbe was the only clerk left in Endymion’s room. They dined together
      almost every day, and went on the top of an omnibus to many a suburban paradise. “I tell you
      what,” said St. Barbe, as they were watching one day together the humours of the world in the
      crowded tea-garden and bustling bowling-green of Canonbury Tavern; “a fellow might get a good
      chapter out of this scene. I could do it, but I will not. What is the use of lavishing one’s
      brains on an ungrateful world? Why, if that fellow Gushy were to write a description of this
      place, which he would do like a penny-a-liner drunk with ginger beer, every countess in
      Mayfair would be reading him, not knowing, the idiot, whether she ought to smile or shed
      tears, and sending him cards with ‘at home’ upon them as large as life. Oh! it is disgusting!
      absolutely disgusting. It is a nefarious world, sir. You will find it out some day. I am as
      much robbed by that fellow Gushy as men are on the highway. He is appropriating my income, and
      the income of thousands of honest fellows. And then he pretends he is writing for the people!
      The people! What does he know about the people? Annals of the New Cut and Saffron Hill. He
      thinks he will frighten some lord, who will ask him to dinner. And that he calls Progress. I
      hardly know which is the worst class in this country—the aristocracy, the middle class, or
      what they call the people. I hate them all.”</p>
     <p>About the fall of the leaf the offices were all filled again, and among the rest Trenchard
      returned. “His brother has been ill,” said St. Barbe. “They say that Trenchard is very fond of
      him. Fond of a brother who keeps him out of four thousand pounds per annum! What will man not
      say? And yet I could not go and congratulate Trenchard on his brother’s death. It would be
      ‘bad taste.’ Trenchard would perhaps never speak to me again, though he had been lying awake
      all night chuckling over the event. And Gushy takes an amiable view of this world of hypocrisy
      and plunder. And that is why Gushy is so popular!”</p>
     <p>There was one incident at the beginning of November, which eventually exercised no mean
      influence on the life of Endymion. Trenchard offered one evening to introduce him as a guest
      to a celebrated debating society, of which Trenchard was a distinguished member. This society
      had grown out of the Union at Cambridge, and was originally intended to have been a
      metropolitan branch of that famous association. But in process of time it was found that such
      a constitution was too limited to ensure those numbers and that variety of mind desirable in
      such an institution. It was therefore opened to the whole world duly qualified. The
      predominant element, however, for a long time consisted of Cambridge men.</p>
     <p>This society used to meet in a large room, fitted up as much like the House of Commons as
      possible, and which was in Freemason’s Tavern, in Great Queen Street. Some hundred and fifty
      members were present when Endymion paid his first visit there, and the scene to Endymion was
      novel and deeply interesting. Though only a guest, he was permitted to sit in the body of the
      chamber, by the side of Trenchard, who kindly gave him some information, as the proceedings
      advanced, as to the principal personages who took part in them.</p>
     <p>The question to-night was, whether the decapitation of Charles the First were a justifiable
      act, and the debate was opened in the affirmative by a young man with a singularly sunny face
      and a voice of music. His statement was clear and calm. Though nothing could be more
      uncompromising than his opinions, it seemed that nothing could be fairer than his facts.</p>
     <p>“That is Hortensius,” said Trenchard; “he will be called this term. They say he did nothing
      at the university, and is too idle to do anything at the bar; but I think highly of him. You
      should hear him in reply.”</p>
     <p>The opening speech was seconded by a very young man, in a most artificial style, remarkable
      for its superfluity of intended sarcasm, which was delivered in a highly elaborate tone, so
      that the speaker seemed severe without being keen.</p>
     <p>“‘Tis the new Cambridge style,” whispered Trenchard, “but it will not go down here.”</p>
     <p>The question having been launched, Spruce arose, a very neat speaker; a little too
      mechanical, but plausible. Endymion was astonished at the dexterous turns in his own favour
      which he gave to many of the statements of Hortensius, and how he mangled and massacred the
      seconder, who had made a mistake in a date.</p>
     <p>“He is the Tory leader,” said Trenchard. “There are not twenty Tories in our Union, but we
      always listen to him. He is sharp, Jawett will answer him.”</p>
     <p>And, accordingly, that great man rose. Jawett, in dulcet tones of philanthropy, intimated
      that he was not opposed to the decapitation of kings; on the contrary, if there were no other
      way of getting rid of them, he would have recourse to such a method. But he did not think the
      case before them was justifiable.</p>
     <p>“Always crotchety,” whispered Trenchard.</p>
     <p>Jawett thought the whole conception of the opening speech erroneous. It proceeded on the
      assumption that the execution of Charles was the act of the people; on the contrary, it was an
      intrigue of Cromwell, who was the only person who profited by it.</p>
     <p>Cromwell was vindicated and panegyrised in a flaming speech by Montreal, who took this
      opportunity of denouncing alike kings and bishops, Church and State, with powerful invective,
      terminating his address by the expression of an earnest hope that he might be spared to
      witness the inevitable Commonwealth of England.</p>
     <p>“He only lost his election for Rattleton by ten votes,” said Trenchard. “We call him the
      Lord Protector, and his friends here think he will be so.”</p>
     <p>The debate was concluded, after another hour, by Hortensius, and Endymion was struck by the
      contrast between his first and second manner. Safe from reply, and reckless in his security,
      it is not easy to describe the audacity of his retorts, or the tumult of his eloquence. Rapid,
      sarcastic, humorous, picturesque, impassioned, he seemed to carry everything before him, and
      to resemble his former self in nothing but the music of his voice, which lent melody to scorn,
      and sometimes reached the depth of pathos.</p>
     <p>Endymion walked home with Mr. Trenchard, and in a musing mood. “I should not care how lazy I
      was,” said Endymion, “if I could speak like Hortensius.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
     <p>The snow was falling about the time when the Swindon coach, in which Endymion was a
      passenger, was expected at Hurstley, and the snow had been falling all day. Nothing had been
      more dreary than the outward world, or less entitled to the merry epithet which is the
      privilege of the season. The gardener had been despatched to the village inn, where the coach
      stopped, with a lantern and cloaks and umbrellas. Within the house the huge blocks of
      smouldering beech sent forth a hospitable heat, and, whenever there was a sound, Myra threw
      cones on the inflamed mass, that Endymion might be welcomed with a blaze. Mrs. Ferrars, who
      had appeared to-day, though late, and had been very nervous and excited, broke down half an
      hour before her son could arrive, and, murmuring that she would reappear, had retired. Her
      husband was apparently reading, but his eye wandered and his mind was absent from the
      volume.</p>
     <p>The dogs barked, Mr. Ferrars threw down his book, Myra forgot her cones; the door burst
      open, and she was in her brother’s arms.</p>
     <p>“And where is mamma?” said Endymion, after he had greeted his father.</p>
     <p>“She will be here directly,” said Mr. Ferrars. “You are late, and the suspense of your
      arrival a little agitated her.”</p>
     <p>Three quarters of a year had elapsed since the twins had parted, and they were at that
      period of life when such an interval often produces no slight changes in personal appearance.
      Endymion, always tall for his years, had considerably grown; his air, and manner, and dress
      were distinguished. But three quarters of a year had produced a still greater effect upon his
      sister. He had left her a beautiful girl: her beauty was not less striking, but it was now the
      beauty of a woman. Her mien was radiant but commanding, and her brow, always remarkable, was
      singularly impressive.</p>
     <p>They stood in animated converse before the fire, Endymion between his father and his sister
      and retaining of each a hand, when Mr. Ferrars nodded to Myra and said, “I think now;” and
      Myra, not reluctantly, but not with happy eagerness, left the room.</p>
     <p>“She is gone for your poor mother,” said Mr. Ferrars; “we are uneasy about her, my dear
      boy.”</p>
     <p>Myra was some time away, and when she returned, she was alone. “She says she must see him
      first in her room,” said Myra, in a low voice, to her father; “but that will never do; you or
      I must go with him.”</p>
     <p>“You had better go,” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>She took her brother’s hand and led him away. “I go with you, to prevent dreadful scenes,”
      said his sister on the staircase. “Try to behave just as in old times, and as if you saw no
      change.”</p>
     <p>Myra went into the chamber first, to give to her mother, if possible, the keynote of the
      interview, and of which she had already furnished the prelude. “We are all so happy to see
      Endymion again, dear mamma. Papa is quite gay.”</p>
     <p>And then when Endymion, answering his sister’s beckon, entered, Mrs. Ferrars rushed forward
      with a sort of laugh, and cried out, “Oh! I am so happy to see you again, my child. I feel
      quite gay.”</p>
     <p>He embraced her, but he could not believe it was his mother. A visage at once haggard and
      bloated had supplanted that soft and rich countenance which had captivated so many. A robe
      concealed her attenuated frame; but the lustrous eyes were bleared and bloodshot, and the
      accents of the voice, which used to be at once melodious and a little drawling, hoarse, harsh,
      and hurried.</p>
     <p>She never stopped talking; but it was all in one key, and that the prescribed one—her
      happiness at his arrival, the universal gaiety it had produced, and the merry Christmas they
      were to keep. After a time she began to recur to the past, and to sigh; but instantly Myra
      interfered with “You know, mamma, you are to dine downstairs to-day, and you will hardly have
      time to dress;” and she motioned to Endymion to retire.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ferrars kept the dinner waiting a long time, and, when she entered the room, it was
      evident that she was painfully excited. She had a cap on, and had used some rouge.</p>
     <p>“Endymion must take me in to dinner,” she hurriedly exclaimed as she entered, and then
      grasped her son’s arm.</p>
     <p>It seemed a happy and even a merry dinner, and yet there was something about it forced and
      constrained. Mrs. Ferrars talked a great deal, and Endymion told them a great many anecdotes
      of those men and things which most interested them, and Myra seemed to be absorbed in his
      remarks and narratives, and his mother would drink his health more than once, when suddenly
      she went into hysterics, and all was anarchy. Mr. Ferrars looked distressed and infinitely
      sad; and Myra, putting her arm round her mother, and whispering words of calm or comfort,
      managed to lead her out of the room, and neither of them returned.</p>
     <p>“Poor creature!” said Mr. Ferrars, with a sigh. “Seeing you has been too much for her.”</p>
     <p>The next morning Endymion and his sister paid a visit to the rectory, and there they met
      Nigel, who was passing his Christmas at home. This was a happy meeting. The rector had written
      an essay on squirrels, and showed them a glass containing that sportive little animal in all
      its frolic forms. Farmer Thornberry had ordered a path to be cleared on the green from the
      hall to the rectory; and “that is all,” said Mrs. Penruddock, “we have to walk upon, except
      the high road. The snow has drifted to such a degree that it is impossible to get to the
      Chase. I went out the day before yesterday with Carlo as a guide. When I did not clearly make
      out my way, I sent him forward, and sometimes I could only see his black head emerging from
      the snow. So I had to retreat.”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ferrars did not appear this day. Endymion visited her in her room. He found her flighty
      and incoherent. She seemed to think that he had returned permanently to Hurstley, and said she
      never had any good opinion of the scheme of his leaving them. If it had been the Foreign
      Office, as was promised, and his father had been in the Cabinet, which was his right, it might
      have been all very well. But, if he were to leave home, he ought to have gone into the Guards,
      and it was not too late. And then they might live in a small house in town, and look after
      him. There were small houses in Wilton Crescent, which would do very well. Besides, she
      herself wanted change of air. Hurstley did not agree with her. She had no appetite. She never
      was well except in London, or Wimbledon. She wished that, as Endymion was here, he would speak
      to his father on the subject. She saw no reason why they should not live at their place at
      Wimbledon as well as here. It was not so large a house, and, therefore, would not be so
      expensive.</p>
     <p>Endymion’s holiday was only to last a week, and Myra seemed jealous of his sparing any
      portion of it to Nigel; yet the rector’s son was sedulous in his endeavours to enjoy the
      society of his former companion. There seemed some reason for his calling at the hall every
      day. Mr. Ferrars broke through his habits, and invited Nigel to dine with them; and after
      dinner, saying that he would visit Mrs. Ferrars, who was unwell, left them alone. It was the
      only time they had yet been alone. Endymion found that there was no change in the feelings and
      views of Nigel respecting Church matters, except that his sentiments and opinions were more
      assured, and, if possible, more advanced. He would not tolerate any reference to the state of
      the nation; it was the state of the Church which engrossed his being. No government was
      endurable that was not divine. The Church was divine, and on that he took his stand.</p>
     <p>Nigel was to take his degree next term, and orders as soon as possible. He looked forward
      with confidence, after doubtless a period of disturbance, confusion, probably violence, and
      even anarchy, to the establishment of an ecclesiastical polity that would be catholic
      throughout the realm. Endymion just intimated the very contrary opinions that Jawett held upon
      these matters, and mentioned, though not as an adherent, some of the cosmopolitan sentiments
      of Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“The Church is cosmopolitan,” said Nigel; “the only practicable means by which you can
      attain to identity of motive and action.”</p>
     <p>Then they rejoined Myra, but Nigel soon returned to the absorbing theme. His powers had much
      developed since he and Endymion used to wander together over Hurstley Chase. He had great
      eloquence, his views were startling and commanding, and his expressions forcible and
      picturesque. All was heightened, too, by his striking personal appearance and the beauty of
      his voice. He seemed something between a young prophet and an inquisitor; a remarkable
      blending of enthusiasm and self-control.</p>
     <p>A person more experienced in human nature than Endymion might have observed, that all this
      time, while Nigel was to all appearance chiefly addressing himself to Endymion, he was, in
      fact, endeavouring to impress his sister. Endymion knew, from the correspondence of Myra, that
      Nigel had been, especially in the summer, much at Hurstley; and when he was alone with his
      sister, he could not help remarking, “Nigel is as strong as ever in his views.”</p>
     <p>“Yes,” she replied; “he is very clever and very good-looking. It is a pity he is going into
      the Church. I do not like clergymen.”</p>
     <p>On the third day of the visit, Mrs. Ferrars was announced to be unwell, and in the evening
      very unwell; and Mr. Ferrars sent to the nearest medical man, and he was distant, to attend
      her. The medical man did not arrive until past midnight, and, after visiting his patient,
      looked grave. She had fever, but of what character it was difficult to decide. The medical man
      had brought some remedies with him, and he stayed the night at the hall. It was a night of
      anxiety and alarm, and the household did not retire until nearly the break of dawn.</p>
     <p>The next day it seemed that the whole of the Penruddock family were in the house. Mrs.
      Penruddock insisted on nursing Mrs. Ferrars, and her husband looked as if he thought he might
      be wanted. It was unreasonable that Nigel should be left alone. His presence, always pleasing,
      was a relief to an anxious family, and who were beginning to get alarmed. The fever did not
      subside. On the contrary, it increased, and there were other dangerous symptoms. There was a
      physician of fame at Oxford, whom Nigel wished they would call in. Matters were too pressing
      to wait for the posts, and too complicated to trust to an ordinary messenger. Nigel, who was
      always well mounted, was in his saddle in an instant. He seemed to be all resource,
      consolation, and energy: “If I am fortunate, he will be here in four hours; at all events, I
      will not return alone.”</p>
     <p>Four terrible hours were these: Mr. Ferrars, restless and sad, and listening with a vacant
      air or an absent look to the kind and unceasing talk of the rector; Myra, silent in her
      mother’s chamber; and Endymion, wandering about alone with his eyes full of tears. This was
      the Merrie Christmas he had talked of, and this his long-looked-for holiday. He could think of
      nothing but his mother’s kindness; and the days gone by, when she was so bright and happy,
      came back to him with painful vividness. It seemed to him that he belonged to a doomed and
      unhappy family. Youth and its unconscious mood had hitherto driven this thought from his mind;
      but it occurred to him now, and would not be driven away.</p>
     <p>Nigel was fortunate. Before sunset he returned to Hurstley in a postchaise with the Oxford
      physician, whom he had furnished with an able and accurate diagnosis of the case. All that art
      could devise, and all that devotion could suggest, were lavished on the sufferer, but in vain;
      and four days afterwards, the last day of Endymion’s long-awaited holiday, Mr. Ferrars closed
      for ever the eyes of that brilliant being, who, with some weaknesses, but many noble
      qualities, had shared with no unequal spirit the splendour and the adversity of his
      existence.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVI</head>
     <p>Nigel took a high degree and obtained first-class honours. He was ordained by the bishop of
      the diocese as soon after as possible. His companions, who looked up to him with every
      expectation of his eminence and influence, were disappointed, however, in the course of life
      on which he decided. It was different from that which he had led them to suppose it would be.
      They had counted on his becoming a resident light of the University, filling its highest
      offices, and ultimately reaching the loftiest stations in the Church. Instead of that he
      announced that he had resolved to become a curate to his father, and that he was about to bury
      himself in the solitude of Hurstley.</p>
     <p>It was in the early summer following the death of Mrs. Ferrars that he settled there. He was
      frequently at the hall, and became intimate with Mr. Ferrars. Notwithstanding the difference
      of age, there was between them a sympathy of knowledge and thought. In spite of his decided
      mind, Nigel listened to Mr. Ferrars with deference, soliciting his judgment, and hanging, as
      it were, on his accents of wise experience and refined taste. So Nigel became a favourite with
      Mr. Ferrars; for there are few things more flattering than the graceful submission of an
      accomplished intellect, and, when accompanied by youth, the spell is sometimes
      fascinating.</p>
     <p>The death of his wife seemed to have been a great blow to Mr. Ferrars. The expression of his
      careworn, yet still handsome, countenance became, if possible, more saddened. It was with
      difficulty that his daughter could induce him to take exercise, and he had lost altogether
      that seeming interest in their outer world which once at least he affected to feel. Myra,
      though ever content to be alone, had given up herself much to her father since his great
      sorrow; but she felt that her efforts to distract him from his broodings were not eminently
      successful, and she hailed with a feeling of relief the establishment of Nigel in the parish,
      and the consequent intimacy that arose between him and her father.</p>
     <p>Nigel and Myra were necessarily under these circumstances thrown much together. As time
      advanced he passed his evenings generally at the hall, for he was a proficient in the only
      game which interested Mr. Ferrars, and that was chess. Reading and writing all day, Mr.
      Ferrars required some remission of attention, and his relaxation was chess. Before the games,
      and between the games, and during delightful tea-time, and for the happy quarter of an hour
      which ensued when the chief employment of the evening ceased, Nigel appealed much to Myra, and
      endeavoured to draw out her mind and feelings. He lent her books, and books that favoured,
      indirectly at least, his own peculiar views—volumes of divine poesy that had none of the twang
      of psalmody, tales of tender and sometimes wild and brilliant fancy, but ever full of symbolic
      truth.</p>
     <p>Chess-playing requires complete abstraction, and Nigel, though he was a double first,
      occasionally lost a game from a lapse in that condensed attention that secures triumph. The
      fact is, he was too frequently thinking of something else besides the moves on the board, and
      his ear was engaged while his eye wandered, if Myra chanced to rise from her seat or make the
      slightest observation.</p>
     <p>The woods were beginning to assume the first fair livery of autumn, when it is beautiful
      without decay. The lime and the larch had not yet dropped a golden leaf, and the burnished
      beeches flamed in the sun. Every now and then an occasional oak or elm rose, still as full of
      deep green foliage as if it were midsummer; while the dark verdure of the pines sprang up with
      effective contrast amid the gleaming and resplendent chestnuts.</p>
     <p>There was a glade at Hurstley, bounded on each side with masses of yew, their dark green
      forms now studded with crimson berries. Myra was walking one morning in this glade when she
      met Nigel, who was on one of his daily pilgrimages, and he turned round and walked by her
      side.</p>
     <p>“I am sure I cannot give you news of your brother,” he said, “but I have had a letter this
      morning from Endymion. He seems to take great interest in his debating club.”</p>
     <p>“I am so glad he has become a member of it,” said Myra. “That kind Mr. Trenchard, whom I
      shall never see to thank him for all his goodness to Endymion, proposed him. It occupies his
      evenings twice a week, and then it gives him subjects to think of and read up in the
      interval.”</p>
     <p>“Yes; it is a good thing,” said Nigel moodily; “and if he is destined for public life, which
      perhaps he may be, no contemptible discipline.”</p>
     <p>“Dear boy!” said Myra, with a sigh. “I do not see what public life he is destined to, except
      slaving at a desk. But sometimes one has dreams.”</p>
     <p>“Yes; we all have dreams,” said Nigel, with an air of abstraction.</p>
     <p>“It is impossible to resist the fascination of a fine autumnal morn,” said Myra; “but give
      me the long days of summer and its rich leafy joys. I like to wander about, and dine at nine
      o’clock.”</p>
     <p>“Delightful, doubtless, with a sympathising companion.”</p>
     <p>“Endymion was such a charming companion,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“But he has left us,” said Nigel; “and you are alone.”</p>
     <p>“I am alone,” said Myra; “but I am used to solitude, and I can think of him.”</p>
     <p>“Would I were Endymion,” said Nigel, “to be thought of by you!”</p>
     <p>Myra looked at him with something of a stare; but he continued—</p>
     <p>“All seasons would be to me fascination, were I only by your side. Yes; I can no longer
      repress the irresistible confusion of my love. I am here, and I am here only, because I love
      you. I quitted Oxford and all its pride that I might have the occasional delight of being your
      companion. I was not presumptuous in my thoughts, and believed that would content me; but I
      can no longer resist the consummate spell, and I offer you my heart and my life.”</p>
     <p>“I am amazed; I am a little overwhelmed,” said Myra. “Pardon me, dear Mr. Penruddock—dear
      Nigel—you speak of things of which I have not thought.”</p>
     <p>“Think of them! I implore you to think of them, and now!”</p>
     <p>“We are a fallen family,” said Myra, “perhaps a doomed one. We are not people to connect
      yourself with. You have witnessed some of our sorrows, and soothed them. I shall be ever
      grateful to you for the past. But I sometimes feel our cup is not yet full, and I have long
      resolved to bear my cross alone. But, irrespective of all other considerations, I can never
      leave my father.”</p>
     <p>“I have spoken to your father,” said Nigel, “and he approved my suit.”</p>
     <p>“While my father lives I shall not quit him,” said Myra; “but, let me not mislead you, I do
      not live for my father—I live for another.”</p>
     <p>“For another?” inquired Nigel, with anxiety.</p>
     <p>“For one you know. My life is devoted to Endymion. There is a mystic bond between us,
      originating, perhaps, in the circumstance of our birth; for we are twins. I never mean to
      embarrass him with a sister’s love, and perhaps hereafter may see less of him even than I see
      now; but I shall be in the world, whatever be my lot, high or low—the active, stirring
      world—working for him, thinking only of him. Yes; moulding events and circumstances in his
      favour;” and she spoke with fiery animation. “I have brought myself, by long meditation, to
      the conviction that a human being with a settled purpose must accomplish it, and that nothing
      can resist a will that will stake even existence for its fulfilment.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVII</head>
     <p>Endymion had returned to his labours, after the death of his mother, much dispirited. Though
      young and hopeful, his tender heart could not be insensible to the tragic end. There is
      anguish in the recollection that we have not adequately appreciated the affection of those
      whom we have loved and lost. It tortured him to feel that he had often accepted with
      carelessness or indifference the homage of a heart that had been to him ever faithful in its
      multiplied devotion. Then, though he was not of a melancholy and brooding nature, in this
      moment of bereavement he could not drive from his mind the consciousness that there had long
      been hanging over his home a dark lot, as it were, of progressive adversity. His family seemed
      always sinking, and he felt conscious how the sanguine spirit of his mother had sustained them
      in their trials. His father had already made him the depositary of his hopeless cares; and if
      anything happened to that father, old and worn out before his time, what would become of
      Myra?</p>
     <p>Nigel, who in their great calamity seemed to have thought of everything, and to have done
      everything, had written to the chief of his office, and also to Mr. Trenchard, explaining the
      cause of the absence of Endymion from his duties. There were no explanations, therefore,
      necessary when he reappeared; no complaints, but only sympathy and general kindness. In
      Warwick Street there was unaffected sorrow; Sylvia wept and went into the prettiest mourning
      for her patroness, and Mr. Rodney wore a crape on his hat. “I never saw her,” said Imogene,
      “but I am told she was heavenly.”</p>
     <p>Waldershare was very kind to Endymion, and used to take him to the House of Commons on
      interesting evenings, and, if he succeeded in getting Endymion a place under the gallery,
      would come and talk to him in the course of the night, and sometimes introduce him to the
      mysteries of Bellamy’s, where Endymion had the satisfaction of partaking of a steak in the
      presence of statesmen and senators.</p>
     <p>“You are in the precincts of public life,” said Waldershare; “and if you ever enter it,
      which I think you will,” he would add thoughtfully, “it will be interesting for you to
      remember that you have seen these characters, many of whom will then have passed away. Like
      the shades of a magic lantern,” he added, with something between a sigh and a smile. “One of
      my constituents sent me a homily this morning, the burthen of which was, I never thought of
      death. The idiot! I never think of anything else. It is my weakness. One should never think of
      death. One should think of life. That is real piety.”</p>
     <p>This spring and summer were passed tranquilly by Endymion, but not unprofitably. He never
      went to any place of public amusement, and, cherishing his sorrow, declined those slight
      openings to social life which occasionally offered themselves even to him; but he attended his
      debating club with regularity, and, though silent, studied every subject which was brought
      before it. It interested him to compare their sayings and doings with those of the House of
      Commons, and he found advantage in the critical comparison. Though not in what is styled
      society, his mind did not rust from the want of intelligent companions. The clear perception,
      accurate knowledge, and unerring judgment of Trenchard, the fantastic cynicism of St. Barbe,
      and all the stores of the exuberant and imaginative Waldershare, were brought to bear on a
      young and plastic intelligence, gifted with a quick though not a too profound sensibility
      which soon ripened into tact, and which, after due discrimination, was tenacious of beneficial
      impressions.</p>
     <p>In the autumn, Endymion returned home for a long visit and a happy one. He found Nigel
      settled at Hurstley, and almost domesticated at the hall; his father more cheerful than his
      sister’s earlier letters had led him to suppose; and she herself so delighted by the constant
      companionship of her brother that she seemed to have resumed all her original pride of
      life.</p>
     <p>Nearly two years’ acquaintance, however limited, with the world, had already exercised a
      ripening influence over Endymion. Nigel soon perceived this, though, with a native tact which
      circumstances had developed, Endymion avoided obtruding his new conclusions upon his former
      instructor. But that deep and eager spirit, unwilling ever to let a votary escape, and
      absorbed intellectually by one vast idea, would not be baffled. Nigel had not renounced the
      early view of Endymion taking orders, and spoke of his London life as an incident which, with
      his youth, he might in time only look upon as an episode in his existence.</p>
     <p>“I trust I shall ever be a devoted son of the Church,” said Endymion; “but I confess I feel
      no predisposition to take orders, even if I had the opportunity, which probably I never shall
      have. If I were to choose my career it would be public life. I am on the last step of the
      ladder, and I do not suppose that I can ever be anything but a drudge. But even that would
      interest me. It brings one in contact with those who are playing the great game. One at least
      fancies one comprehends something of the government of mankind. Mr. Waldershare takes me often
      to the House of Commons, and I must say, I am passionately fond of it.”</p>
     <p>After Endymion’s return to London that scene occurred between Nigel and Myra, in the glade
      at Hurstley, which we have noticed in the preceding chapter. In the evening of that day Nigel
      did not pay his accustomed visit to the hall, and the father and the daughter were alone. Then
      it was, notwithstanding evident agitation, and even with some degree of solemnity, that Mr.
      Ferrars broke to his daughter that there was a subject on which he wished seriously to confer
      with her.</p>
     <p>“Is it about Nigel?” she inquired with calmness.</p>
     <p>“It is about Nigel.”</p>
     <p>“I have seen him, and he has spoken to me.”</p>
     <p>“And what have you replied?”</p>
     <p>“What I fear will not be satisfactory to you, sir, but what is irrevocable.”</p>
     <p>“Your union would give me life and hope,” said Mr. Ferrars; and then, as she remained
      silent, he continued after a pause: “For its happiness there seems every security. He is of
      good family, and with adequate means, and, I firmly believe, no inconsiderable future. His
      abilities are already recognised; his disposition is noble. As for his personal qualities, you
      are a better judge than I am; but, for my part, I never saw a countenance that more became the
      beauty and nobility of his character.”</p>
     <p>“I think him very good-looking,” said Myra, “and there is no doubt he is clever, and he has
      shown himself, on more than one occasion, amiable.”</p>
     <p>“Then what more can you require?” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“I require nothing; I do not wish to marry.”</p>
     <p>“But, my daughter, my dearest daughter,” said Mr. Ferrars, “bear with the anxiety of a
      parent who is at least devoted to you. Our separation would be my last and severest sorrow,
      and I have had many; but there is no necessity to consider that case, for Nigel is content, is
      more than content, to live as your husband under this roof.”</p>
     <p>“So he told me.”</p>
     <p>“And that removed one objection that you might naturally feel?”</p>
     <p>“I certainly should never leave you, sir,” said Myra, “and I told Nigel so; but that
      contingency had nothing to do with my decision. I declined his offer, because I have no wish
      to marry.”</p>
     <p>“Women are born to be married,” said Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“And yet I believe most marriages are unhappy,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“Oh! if your objection to marry Nigel arises from an abstract objection to marriage itself,”
      said Mr. Ferrars, “it is a subject which we might talk over calmly, and perhaps remove your
      prejudices.”</p>
     <p>“I have no objection against marriage,” rejoined Myra. “It is likely enough that I may marry
      some day, and probably make an unhappy marriage; but that is not the question before us. It is
      whether I should marry Nigel. That cannot be, my dear father, and he knows it. I have assured
      him so in a manner which cannot be mistaken.”</p>
     <p>“We are a doomed family!” exclaimed the unhappy Mr. Ferrars, clasping his hands.</p>
     <p>“So I have long felt,” said Myra. “I can bear our lot; but I want no strangers to be
      introduced to share its bitterness, and soothe us with their sympathy.”</p>
     <p>“You speak like a girl,” said Mr. Ferrars, “and a headstrong girl, which you always have
      been. You know not what you are talking about. It is a matter of life or death. Your decorous
      marriage would have saved us from absolute ruin.”</p>
     <p>“Alone, I can meet absolute ruin,” said Myra. “I have long contemplated such a contingency,
      and am prepared for it. My marriage with Nigel could hardly save you, sir, from such a
      visitation, if it be impending. But I trust in that respect, if in no other, you have used a
      little of the language of exaggeration. I have never received, and I have never presumed to
      seek, any knowledge of your affairs; but I have assumed, that for your life, somehow or other,
      you would be permitted to exist without disgrace. If I survive you, I have neither care nor
      fear.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
     <p>In the following spring a vexatious incident occurred in Warwick Street. The
      highly-considered county member, who was the yearly tenant of Mr. Rodney’s first floor, and
      had been always a valuable patron, suddenly died. An adjourned debate, a tough beefsteak, a
      select committee still harder, and an influenza caught at three o’clock in the morning in an
      imprudent but irresistible walk home with a confidential Lord of the Treasury, had combined
      very sensibly to affect the income of Mr. Rodney. At first he was sanguine that such a
      desirable dwelling would soon find a suitable inhabitant, especially as Mr. Waldershare
      assured him that he would mention the matter to all his friends. But time rolled on, and the
      rooms were still vacant; and the fastidious Rodneys, who at first would only listen to a
      yearly tenant, began to reduce their expectations. Matters had arrived at such a pass in May,
      that, for the first time in their experience, they actually condescended to hoist an
      announcement of furnished apartments.</p>
     <p>In this state of affairs a cab rattled up to the house one morning, out of which a young
      gentleman jumped briskly, and, knocking at the door, asked, of the servant who opened it,
      whether he might see the apartments. He was a young man, apparently not more than one or two
      and twenty, of a graceful figure, somewhat above the middle height, fair, with a countenance
      not absolutely regular, but calm and high-bred. His dress was in the best taste, but to a
      practised eye had something of a foreign cut, and he wore a slight moustache.</p>
     <p>“The rooms will suit me,” he said, “and I have no doubt the price you ask for them is a just
      one;” and he bowed with high-bred courtesy to Sylvia, who was now in attendance on him, and
      who stood with her pretty hands in the pretty pockets of her pretty apron.</p>
     <p>“I am glad to hear that,” said Sylvia. “We have never let them before, except to a yearly
      tenant.”</p>
     <p>“And if we suit each other,” said the gentleman, “I should have no great objection to
      becoming such.”</p>
     <p>“In these matters,” said Sylvia, after a little hesitation, “we give and receive references.
      Mr. Rodney is well known in this neighbourhood and in Westminster generally; but I dare say,”
      she adroitly added, “he has many acquaintances known to you, sir.”</p>
     <p>“Not very likely,” replied the young gentleman; “for I am a foreigner, and only arrived in
      England this morning;” though he spoke English without the slightest accent.</p>
     <p>Sylvia looked a little perplexed; but he continued: “It is quite just that you should be
      assured to whom you are letting your lodgings. The only reference I can give you is to my
      banker, but he is almost too great a man for such matters. Perhaps,” he added, pulling out a
      case from his breast pocket, and taking out of it a note, which he handed to Sylvia, “this may
      assure you that your rent will be paid.”</p>
     <p>Sylvia took a rapid glance at the hundred-pound-note, and twisting it into her little pocket
      with apparent <hi>sangfroid</hi>, though she held it with a tight grasp, murmured that it was
      quite unnecessary, and then offered to give her new lodger an acknowledgment of it.</p>
     <p>“That is really unnecessary,” he replied. “Your appearance commands from me that entire
      confidence which on your part you very properly refuse to a stranger and a foreigner like
      myself.”</p>
     <p>“What a charming young man!” thought Sylvia, pressing with emotion her
      hundred-pound-note.</p>
     <p>“Now,” continued the young gentleman, “I will return to the station to release my servant,
      who is a prisoner there with my luggage. Be pleased to make him at home. I shall myself not
      return probably till the evening; and in the meantime,” he added, giving Sylvia his card, “you
      will admit anything that arrives here addressed to Colonel Albert.”</p>
     <p>The settlement of Colonel Albert in Warwick Street was an event of no slight importance. It
      superseded for a time all other topics of conversation, and was discussed at length in the
      evenings, especially with Mr. Vigo. Who was he? And in what service was he colonel? Mr.
      Rodney, like a man of the world, assumed that all necessary information would in time be
      obtained from the colonel’s servant; but even men of the world sometimes miscalculate. The
      servant, who was a Belgian, had only been engaged by the colonel at Brussels a few days before
      his departure for England, and absolutely knew nothing of his master, except that he was a
      gentleman with plenty of money and sufficient luggage. Sylvia, who was the only person who had
      seen the colonel, was strongly in his favour. Mr. Rodney looked doubtful, and avoided any
      definite opinion until he had had the advantage of an interview with his new lodger. But this
      was not easy to obtain. Colonel Albert had no wish to see the master of the house, and, if he
      ever had that desire, his servant would accordingly communicate it in the proper quarter. At
      present he was satisfied with all the arrangements, and wished neither to make nor to receive
      remarks. The habits of the new lodger were somewhat of a recluse. He was generally engaged in
      his rooms the whole day, and seldom left them till the evening, and nobody, as yet, had called
      upon him. Under these circumstances, Imogene was instructed to open the matter to Mr.
      Waldershare when she presided over his breakfast-table; and that gentleman said he would make
      inquiries about the colonel at the Travellers’ Club, where Waldershare passed a great deal of
      his time. “If he be anybody,” said Mr. Waldershare, “he is sure in time to be known there, for
      he will be introduced as a visitor.” At present, however, it turned out that the “Travellers’”
      knew nothing of Colonel Albert; and time went on, and Colonel Albert was not introduced as a
      visitor there.</p>
     <p>After a little while there was a change in the habits of the colonel. One morning, about
      noon, a groom, extremely well appointed, and having under his charge a couple of steeds of
      breed and beauty, called at Warwick Street, and the colonel rode out, and was long absent, and
      after that, every day, and generally at the same hour, mounted his horse. Mr. Rodney was never
      wearied of catching a glimpse of his distinguished lodger over the blinds of the ground-floor
      room, and of admiring the colonel’s commanding presence in his saddle, distinguished as his
      seat was alike by its grace and vigour.</p>
     <p>In the course of a little time, another incident connected with the colonel occurred which
      attracted notice and excited interest. Towards the evening a brougham, marked, but quietly,
      with a foreign coronet, stopped frequently at Mr. Rodney’s house, and a visitor to the colonel
      appeared in the form of a middle-aged gentleman who never gave his name, and evaded, it seemed
      with practised dexterity, every effort, however adroit, to obtain it. The valet was tried on
      this head also, and replied with simplicity that he did not know the gentleman’s name, but he
      was always called the Baron.</p>
     <p>In the middle of June a packet arrived one day by the coach, from the rector of Hurstley,
      addressed to Endymion, announcing his father’s dangerous illness, and requesting him instantly
      to repair home. Myra was too much occupied to write even a line.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXIX</head>
     <p>It was strange that Myra did not write, were it only a line. It was so unlike her. How often
      this occurred to Endymion during his wearisome and anxious travel! When the coach reached
      Hurstley, he found Mr. Penruddock waiting for him. Before he could inquire after his father,
      that gentleman said, “Myra is at the rectory; you are to come on there.”</p>
     <p>“And my father?”——</p>
     <p>“Matters are critical,” said Mr. Penruddock, as it were avoiding a direct answer, and
      hastening his pace.</p>
     <p>It was literally not a five minutes’ walk from the village inn to the rectory, and they
      walked in silence. The rector took Endymion at once into his study; for we can hardly call it
      a library, though some shelves of books were there, and many stuffed birds.</p>
     <p>The rector closed the door with care, and looked distressed; and, beckoning to Endymion to
      be seated, he said, while still standing and half turning away his head, “My dear boy, prepare
      yourself for the worst.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! he is gone then! my dear, dear father!” and Endymion burst into passionate tears, and
      leant on the table, his face hid in his hands.</p>
     <p>The rector walked up and down the room with an agitated countenance. He could not deny, it
      would seem, the inference of Endymion; and yet he did not proffer those consolations which
      might be urged, and which it became one in his capacity peculiarly to urge.</p>
     <p>“I must see Myra,” said Endymion eagerly, looking up with a wild air and streaming eyes.</p>
     <p>“Not yet,” said the rector; “she is much disturbed. Your poor father is no more; it is too
      true; but,” and here the rector hesitated, “he did not die happily.”</p>
     <p>“What do you mean?” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Your poor father had much to try him,” said the rector. “His life, since he was amongst us
      here, was a life, for him, of adversity—perhaps of great adversity—yet he bore up against it
      with a Christian spirit; he never repined. There was much that was noble and exalted in his
      character. But he never overcame the loss of your dear mother. He was never himself
      afterwards. He was not always master of himself. I could bear witness to that,” said the
      rector, talking, as it were, to himself. “Yes; I could conscientiously give evidence to that
      effect”——</p>
     <p>“What effect?” asked Endymion, with a painful scrutiny.</p>
     <p>“I could show,” said the rector, speaking slowly, and in a low voice, “and others could
      show, that he was not master of himself when he committed the rash act.”</p>
     <p>“O Mr. Penruddock!” exclaimed Endymion, starting from his chair, and seizing the rector by
      the arm. “What is all this?”</p>
     <p>“That a great sorrow has come upon you, and your sister, and all of us,” said Mr.
      Penruddock; “and you, and she, and all of us must bow before the Divine will in trembling,
      though in hope. Your father’s death was not natural.”</p>
     <p>Such was the end of William Pitt Ferrars, on whom nature, opportunity, and culture appeared
      to have showered every advantage. His abilities were considerable, his ambition greater.
      Though intensely worldly, he was not devoid of affections. He found refuge in suicide, as many
      do, from want of imagination. The present was too hard for him, and his future was only a
      chaotic nebula.</p>
     <p>Endymion did not see his sister that evening. She was not made aware of his arrival, and was
      alone with Mrs. Penruddock, who never left her night or day. The rector took charge of her
      brother, and had a sofa-bed made for him in the kind man’s room. He was never to be alone.
      Never the whole night did Endymion close his eyes; and he was almost as much agitated about
      the impending interview with Myra, as about the dark event of terror that had been disclosed
      to him.</p>
     <p>Yet that dreaded interview must take place; and, about noon, the rector told him that Myra
      was in the drawing-room alone, and would receive him. He tottered as he crossed the hall;
      grief and physical exhaustion had unmanned him; his eyes were streaming with tears; he paused
      for a moment with his hand upon the door; he dreaded the anguish of her countenance.</p>
     <p>She advanced and embraced him with tenderness; her face was grave, and not a tear even
      glistened.</p>
     <p>“I have been living in a tragedy for years,” said Myra, in a low, hollow voice; “and the
      catastrophe has now arrived.”</p>
     <p>“Oh, my dear father!” exclaimed Endymion; and he burst into a renewed paroxysm of grief.</p>
     <p>“Yes; he was dear to us, and we were dear to him,” said Myra; “but the curtain has fallen.
      We have to exert ourselves. Energy and self-control were never more necessary to two human
      beings than to us. Here are his keys; his papers must be examined by no one but ourselves.
      There is a terrible ceremony taking place, or impending. When it is all over, we must visit
      the hall at least once more.”</p>
     <p>The whole neighbourhood was full of sorrow for the event, and of sympathy for those bereft.
      It was universally agreed that Mr. Ferrars had never recovered the death of his wife; had
      never been the same man after it; had become distrait, absent, wandering in his mind, and the
      victim of an invincible melancholy. Several instances were given of his inability to manage
      his affairs. The jury, with Farmer Thornberry for foreman, hesitated not in giving a becoming
      verdict. In those days information travelled slowly. There were no railroads then, and no
      telegraphs, and not many clubs. A week elapsed before the sad occurrence was chronicled in a
      provincial paper, and another week before the report was reproduced in London, and then in an
      obscure corner of the journal, and in small print. Everything gets about at last, and the
      world began to stare and talk; but it passed unnoticed to the sufferers, except by a letter
      from Zenobia, received at Hurstley after Myra had departed from her kind friends. Zenobia was
      shocked, nay, overwhelmed, by what she had heard; wanted to know if she could be of use;
      offered to do anything; begged Myra to come and stay with her in St. James’ Square; and
      assured her that, if that were not convenient, when her mourning was over Zenobia would
      present her at court, just the same as if she were her own daughter.</p>
     <p>When the fatal keys were used, and the papers of Mr. Ferrars examined, it turned out worse
      than even Myra, in her darkest prescience, had anticipated. Her father had died absolutely
      penniless. As executor of his father, the funds settled on his wife had remained under his
      sole control, and they had entirely disappeared. There was a letter addressed to Myra on this
      subject. She read it with a pale face, said nothing, and without showing it to Endymion,
      destroyed it. There was to be an immediate sale of their effects at the hall. It was
      calculated that the expenses of the funeral and all the country bills might be defrayed by its
      proceeds.</p>
     <p>“And there will be enough left for me,” said Myra. “I only want ten pounds; for I have
      ascertained that there is no part of England where ten pounds will not take me.”</p>
     <p>Endymion sighed and nearly wept when she said these things. “No,” he would add; “we must
      never part.”</p>
     <p>“That would ensure our common ruin,” said Myra. “No; I will never embarrass you with a
      sister. You can only just subsist; for you could not well live in a garret, except at the
      Rodneys’. I see my way,” said Myra; “I have long meditated over this—I can draw, I can sing, I
      can speak many tongues: I ought to be able to get food and clothing; I may get something more.
      And I shall always be content; for I shall always be thinking of you. However humble even my
      lot, if my will is concentrated on one purpose, it must ultimately effect it. That is my
      creed,” she said, “and I hold it fervently. I will stay with these dear people for a little
      while. They are not exactly the family on which I ought to trespass. But never mind. You will
      be a great man some day, Endymion, and you will remember the good Penruddocks.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXX</head>
     <p>One of the most remarkable families that have ever flourished in England were the
      NEUCHATELS. Their founder was a Swiss, who had established a banking house of high repute in
      England in the latter part of the eighteenth century, and, irrespective of a powerful domestic
      connection, had in time pretty well engrossed the largest and best portion of foreign banking
      business. When the great French Revolution occurred, all the emigrants deposited their jewels
      and their treasure with the Neuchatels. As the disturbance spread, their example was followed
      by the alarmed proprietors and capitalists of the rest of Europe; and, independently of their
      own considerable means, the Neuchatels thus had the command for a quarter of a century, more
      or less, of adventitious millions. They were scrupulous and faithful stewards, but they were
      doubtless repaid for their vigilance, their anxiety, and often their risk, by the
      opportunities which these rare resources permitted them to enjoy. One of the Neuchatels was a
      favourite of Mr. Pitt, and assisted the great statesman in his vast financial arrangements.
      This Neuchatel was a man of large capacity, and thoroughly understood his period. The minister
      wished to introduce him to public life, would have opened Parliament to him, and no doubt have
      showered upon him honours and titles. But Neuchatel declined these overtures. He was one of
      those strong minds who will concentrate their energies on one object; without personal vanity,
      but with a deep-seated pride in the future. He was always preparing for his posterity.
      Governed by this passion, although he himself would have been content to live for ever in
      Bishopsgate Street, where he was born, he had become possessed of a vast principality, and
      which, strange to say, with every advantage of splendour and natural beauty, was not an hour’s
      drive from Whitechapel.</p>
     <p>HAINAULT HOUSE had been raised by a British peer in the days when nobles were fond of
      building Palladian palaces. It was a chief work of Sir William Chambers, and in its style, its
      beauty, and almost in its dimensions, was a rival of Stowe or Wanstead. It stood in a deer
      park, and was surrounded by a royal forest. The family that had raised it wore out in the
      earlier part of this century. It was supposed that the place must be destroyed and dismantled.
      It was too vast for a citizen, and the locality was no longer sufficiently refined for a
      conscript father. In this dilemma, Neuchatel stepped in and purchased the whole affair—palace,
      and park, and deer, and pictures, and halls, and galleries of statue and bust, and furniture,
      and even wines, and all the farms that remained, and all the seigneurial rights in the royal
      forest. But he never lived there. Though he spared nothing in the maintenance and the
      improvement of the domain, except on a Sunday he never visited it, and was never known to
      sleep under its roof. “It will be ready for those who come after me,” he would remark, with a
      modest smile.</p>
     <p>Those who came after him were two sons, between whom his millions were divided; and Adrian,
      the eldest, in addition to his share, was made the lord of Hainault. Adrian had inherited
      something more, and something more precious, than his father’s treasure—a not inferior
      capacity, united, in his case, with much culture, and with a worldly ambition to which his
      father was a stranger. So long as that father lived, Adrian had been extremely circumspect. He
      seemed only devoted to business, and to model his conduct on that of his eminent sire. That
      father who had recognised with pride and satisfaction his capacity, and who was without
      jealousy, had initiated his son during his lifetime in all the secrets of his wondrous craft,
      and had entrusted him with a leading part in their affairs. Adrian had waited in Downing
      Street on Lord Liverpool, as his father years before had waited on Mr. Pitt.</p>
     <p>The elder Neuchatel departed this life a little before the second French Revolution of 1830,
      which had been so fatal to Mr. Ferrars. Adrian, who had never committed himself in politics,
      further than sitting a short time for a reputed Tory borough, for which he paid a rent of a
      thousand a year to the proprietor, but who was known to have been nurtured in the school of
      Pitt and Wellington, astonished the world by voting for Lord Grey’s Reform Bill, and
      announcing himself as a Liberal. This was a large fish for the new Liberal Treasury to
      capture; their triumph was great, and they determined to show that they appreciated the power
      and the influence of their new ally. At the dissolution of 1831, Adrian Neuchatel was a
      candidate for a popular constituency, and was elected at the head of the poll. His brother,
      Melchior, was also returned, and a nephew. The Liberals were alarmed by a subscription of
      fabulous dimensions said to have been collected by the Tories to influence the General
      Election; and the undoubted contribution of a noble duke was particularly mentioned, which
      alone appalled the heart of Brooks’. The matter was put before Neuchatel, as he entered the
      club, to which he had been recently elected with acclamation. “So you are a little
      frightened,” he said, with a peculiarly witching smile which he had, half mockery and half
      good nature; as much as to say, “I will do what you wish, but I see through you and everybody
      else.” “So you are a little frightened. Well; we City men must see what we can do against the
      dukes. You may put me down for double his amount.”</p>
     <p>Adrian purchased a very fine mansion in Portland Place, and took up his residence formally
      at Hainault. He delighted in the place, and to dwell there in a manner becoming the scene had
      always been one of his dreams. Now he lived there with unbounded expenditure. He was
      passionately fond of horses, and even in his father’s lifetime had run some at Newmarket in
      another name. The stables at Hainault had been modelled on those at Chantilly, and were almost
      as splendid a pile as the mansion itself. They were soon full, and of first-rate animals in
      their different ways. With his choice teams Adrian could reach Bishopsgate from Hainault,
      particularly if there were no stoppages in Whitechapel, in much under an hour.</p>
     <p>If he had fifty persons in his stables, there were certainly as many in his park and
      gardens. These latter were most elaborate. It seemed there was nothing that Hainault could not
      produce: all the fruits and flowers of the tropics. The conservatories and forcing-houses
      looked, in the distance, like a city of glass. But, after all, the portion of this immense
      establishment which was most renowned, and perhaps, on the whole, best appreciated, was the
      establishment of the kitchen. The chef was the greatest celebrity of Europe; and he had no
      limit to his staff, which he had selected with the utmost scrutiny, maintained with becoming
      spirit, and winnowed with unceasing vigilance. Every day at Hainault was a banquet. What
      delighted Adrian was to bring down without notice a troop of friends, conscious they would be
      received as well as if there had been a preparation of weeks. Sometimes it was a body from the
      Stock Exchange, sometimes a host from the House of Commons, sometimes a board of directors
      with whom he had been transacting business in the morning. It delighted Adrian to see them
      quaffing his burgundy, and stuffing down his truffles, and his choice pies from Strasbourg,
      and all the delicate dishes which many of them looked at with wonder, and tasted with
      timidity. And then he would, with his particular smile, say to a brother bank director, whose
      mouth was full, and who could only answer him with his eyes, “Business gives one an appetite;
      eh, Mr. Trodgits?”</p>
     <p>Sunday was always a great day at Hainault. The Royal and the Stock Exchanges were both of
      them always fully represented; and then they often had an opportunity, which they highly
      appreciated, of seeing and conferring with some public characters, M.P.‘s of note or promise,
      and occasionally a secretary of the Treasury, or a privy councillor. “Turtle makes all men
      equal,” Adrian would observe. “Our friend Trodgits seemed a little embarrassed at first, when
      I introduced him to the Right Honourable; but when they sate next each other at dinner, they
      soon got on very well.”</p>
     <p>On Sunday the guests walked about and amused themselves. No one was allowed to ride or
      drive; Mrs. Neuchatel did not like riding and driving on Sundays. “I see no harm in it,” said
      Adrian, “but I like women to have their way about religion. And you may go to the stables and
      see the horses, and that might take up the morning. And then there are the houses; they will
      amuse you. For my part, I am for a stroll in the forest;” and then he would lead his
      companions, after a delightful ramble, to some spot of agrestic charm, and, looking at it with
      delight, would say, “Pretty, is it not? But then they say this place is not fashionable. It
      will do, I think, for us City men.”</p>
     <p>Adrian had married, when very young, a lady selected by his father. The selection seemed a
      good one. She was the daughter of a most eminent banker, and had herself, though that was of
      slight importance, a large portion. She was a woman of abilities, highly cultivated. Nothing
      had ever been spared that she should possess every possible accomplishment, and acquire every
      information and grace that it was desirable to attain. She was a linguist, a fine musician, no
      mean artist; and she threw out, if she willed it, the treasures of her well-stored and not
      unimaginative mind with ease and sometimes eloquence. Her person, without being absolutely
      beautiful, was interesting. There was even a degree of fascination in her brown velvet eyes.
      And yet Mrs. Neuchatel was not a contented spirit; and though she appreciated the great
      qualities of her husband, and viewed him even with reverence as well as affection, she
      scarcely contributed to his happiness as much as became her. And for this reason. Whether it
      were the result of physical organisation, or whether it were the satiety which was the
      consequence of having been born, and bred, and lived for ever, in a society of which wealth
      was the prime object of existence, and practically the test of excellence, Mrs. Neuchatel had
      imbibed not merely a contempt for money, but absolutely a hatred of it. The prosperity of her
      house depressed her. The stables with their fifty grooms, and the grounds with their fifty
      gardeners, and the daily visit of the head cook to pass the bill of fare, were incidents and
      circumstances that made her melancholy. She looked upon the Stock Exchange coming down to
      dinner as she would on an invasion of the Visigoths, and endured the stiff observations or the
      cumbrous liveliness of the merchants and bank directors with gloomy grace. Something less
      material might be anticipated from the members of Parliament. But whether they thought it
      would please the genius of the place, or whether Adrian selected his friends from those who
      sympathised with his pursuits, the members of Parliament seemed wonderfully to accord with the
      general tone of the conversation, or varied it only by indulging in technical talk of their
      own. Sometimes she would make a desperate effort to change the elements of their society;
      something in this way: “I see M. Arago and M. Mignet have arrived here, Adrian. Do not you
      think we ought to invite them here? And then you might ask Mr. Macaulay to meet them. You said
      you wished to ask Mr. Macaulay.”</p>
     <p>In one respect the alliance between Adrian and his wife was not an unfortunate one. A woman,
      and a woman of abilities, fastidious, and inclined to be querulous, might safely be counted on
      as, in general, ensuring for both parties in their union an unsatisfactory and unhappy life.
      But Adrian, though kind, generous, and indulgent, was so absorbed by his own great affairs,
      was a man at the same time of so serene a temper and so supreme a will, that the over-refined
      fantasies of his wife produced not the slightest effect on the course of his life. Adrian
      Neuchatel was what very few people are—master in his own house. With a rich varnish of
      graciousness and favour, he never swerved from his purpose; and, though willing to effect all
      things by smiles and sweet temper, he had none of that morbid sensibility which allows some
      men to fret over a phrase, to be tortured by a sigh, or to be subdued by a tear.</p>
     <p>There had been born of this marriage only one child, the greatest heiress in England. She
      had been christened after her father, ADRIANA. She was now about seventeen; and, had she not
      been endowed with the finest disposition and the sweetest temper in the world, she must have
      been spoiled, for both her parents idolised her. To see her every day was for Adrian a reward
      for all his labours, and in the midst of his greatest affairs he would always snatch a moment
      to think how he could contribute to her pleasure or her happiness. All that was rare and
      delightful and beautiful in the world was at her command. There was no limit to the
      gratification of her wishes. But, alas! this favoured maiden wished for nothing. Her books
      interested her, and a beautiful nature; but she liked to be alone, or with her mother. She was
      impressed with the horrible and humiliating conviction, that she was courted and admired only
      for her wealth.</p>
     <p>This advertisement met the eye of Myra at Hurstley Rectory about a month after her father’s
      death, and she resolved to answer it. Her reply pleased Mr. Neuchatel. He selected it out of
      hundreds, and placed himself in communication with Mr. Penruddock. The result was, that Miss
      Ferrars was to pay a visit to the Neuchatels; and if, on experience, they liked each other,
      the engagement was to take place.</p>
     <p>In the meantime the good rector of Hurstley arrived on the previous evening with his
      precious charge at Hainault House; and was rewarded for his kind exertions, not only by the
      prospect of assisting Myra, but by some present experience of a splendid and unusual
      scene.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXI</head>
     <p>“What do you think of her, mamma?” said Adriana, with glistening eyes, as she ran into Mrs.
      Neuchatel’s dressing-room for a moment before dinner.</p>
     <p>“I think her manners are perfect,” replied Mrs. Neuchatel; “and as there can be no doubt,
      after all we have heard, of her principles, I think we are most fortunate. But what do you
      think of her, Adriana? For, after all, that is the main question.”</p>
     <p>“I think she is divine,” said Adriana; “but I fear she has no heart.”</p>
     <p>“And why? Surely it is early to decide on such a matter as that!”</p>
     <p>“When I took her to her room,” said Adriana, “I suppose I was nervous; but I burst into
      tears, and threw my arms round her neck and embraced her, but she did not respond. She touched
      my forehead with her lips, and withdrew from my embrace.”</p>
     <p>“She wished, perhaps, to teach you to control your emotions,” said Mrs. Neuchatel. “You have
      known her only an hour, and you could not have done more to your own mother.”</p>
     <p>It had been arranged that there should be no visitors to-day; only a nephew and a foreign
      consul-general, just to break the formality of the meeting. Mr. Neuchatel placed Myra next to
      himself at the round table, and treated her with marked consideration—cordial but courteous,
      and easy, with a certain degree of deference. His wife, who piqued herself on her perception
      of character, threw her brown velvet eyes on her neighbour, Mr. Penruddock, and cross-examined
      him in mystical whispers. She soon recognised his love of nature; and this allowed her to
      dissert on the subject, at once sublime and inexhaustible, with copiousness worthy of the
      theme. When she found he was an entomologist, and that it was not so much mountains as insects
      which interested him, she shifted her ground, but treated it with equal felicity. Strange, but
      nature is never so powerful as in insect life. The white ant can destroy fleets and cities,
      and the locusts erase a province. And then, how beneficent they are! Man would find it
      difficult to rival their exploits: the bee, that gives us honey; the worm, that gives us silk;
      the cochineal, that supplies our manufactures with their most brilliant dye.</p>
     <p>Mr. Penruddock did not seem to know much about manufactures, but always recommended his
      cottagers to keep bees.</p>
     <p>“The lime-tree abounds in our village, and there is nothing the bees love more than its
      blossoms.”</p>
     <p>This direct reference to his village led Mrs. Neuchatel to an inquiry as to the state of the
      poor about Hurstley, and she made the inquiry in a tone of commiseration.</p>
     <p>“Oh! we do pretty well,” said Mr. Penruddock.</p>
     <p>“But how can a family live on ten or twelve shillings a week?” murmured Mrs. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“There it is,” said Mr. Penruddock. “A family has more than that. With a family the income
      proportionately increases.”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Neuchatel sighed. “I must say,” she said, “I cannot help feeling there is something
      wrong in our present arrangements. When I sit down to dinner every day, with all these dishes,
      and remember that there are millions who never taste meat, I cannot resist the conviction that
      it would be better if there were some equal division, and all should have, if not much, at
      least something.”</p>
     <p>“Nonsense, Emily!” said Mr. Neuchatel, who had an organ like Fine-ear, and could catch, when
      necessary, his wife’s most mystical revelations. “My wife, Mr. Penruddock, is a regular
      Communist. I hope you are not,” he added, with a smile, turning to Myra.</p>
     <p>“I think life would be very insipid,” replied Myra, “if all our lots were the same.”</p>
     <p>When the ladies withdrew, Adriana and Myra walked out together hand-in-hand. Mr. Neuchatel
      rose and sate next to Mr. Penruddock, and began to talk politics. His reverend guest could not
      conceal his alarm about the position of the Church and spoke of Lord John Russell’s
      appropriation clause with well-bred horror.</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not think there is much to be afraid of,” said Mr. Neuchatel. “This is a liberal
      age, and you cannot go against it. The people must be educated, and where are the funds to
      come from? We must all do something, and the Church must contribute its share. You know I am a
      Liberal, but I am not for any rash courses. I am not at all sorry that Sir Robert Peel gained
      so much at the last general election. I like parties to be balanced. I am quite content with
      affairs. My friends, the Liberals, are in office, and, being there, they can do very little.
      That is the state of things, is it not, Melchior?” he added, with a smile to his nephew, who
      was an M.P. “A balanced state of parties, and the house of Neuchatel with three votes—that
      will do. We poor City men get a little attention paid to us now, but before the dissolution
      three votes went for nothing. Now, shall we go and ask my daughter to give us a song?”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Neuchatel accompanied her daughter on the piano, and after a time not merely on the
      instrument. The organ of both was fine and richly cultivated. It was choice chamber music. Mr.
      Neuchatel seated himself by Myra. His tone was more than kind, and his manner gentle. “It is a
      little awkward the first day,” he said, “among strangers, but that will wear off. You must
      bring your mind to feel that this is your home, and we shall all of us do everything in our
      power to convince you of it. Mr. Penruddock mentioned to me your wish, under present
      circumstances, to enter as little as possible into society, and this is a very social house.
      Your feeling is natural, and you will be in this matter entirely your own mistress. We shall
      always be glad to see you, but if you are not present we shall know and respect the cause. For
      my own part, I am one of those who would rather cherish affection than indulge grief, but
      every one must follow their mood. I hear you have a brother, to whom you are much attached; a
      twin, too, and they tell me strongly resembling you. He is in a public office, I believe? Now,
      understand this; your brother can come here whenever he likes, without any further invitation.
      Ask him whenever you please. We shall always be glad to see him. No sort of notice is
      necessary. This is not a very small house, and we can always manage to find a bed and a cutlet
      for a friend.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
     <p>Nothing could be more successful than the connection formed between the Neuchatel family and
      Myra Ferrars. Both parties to the compact were alike satisfied. Myra had “got out of that
      hole” which she always hated; and though the new life she had entered was not exactly the one
      she had mused over, and which was founded on the tradition of her early experience, it was a
      life of energy and excitement, of splendour and power, with a total absence of petty vexations
      and miseries, affording neither time nor cause for the wearing chagrin of a monotonous and
      mediocre existence. But the crowning joy of her emancipation was the prospect it offered of
      frequent enjoyment of the society of her brother.</p>
     <p>With regard to the Neuchatels, they found in Myra everything they could desire. Mrs.
      Neuchatel was delighted with a companion who was not the daughter of a banker, and whose
      schooled intellect not only comprehended all her doctrines, however abstruse or fanciful, but
      who did not hesitate, if necessary, to controvert or even confute them. As for Adriana, she
      literally idolised a friend whose proud spirit and clear intelligence were calculated to
      exercise a strong but salutary influence over her timid and sensitive nature. As for the great
      banker himself, who really had that faculty of reading character which his wife flattered
      herself she possessed, he had made up his mind about Myra from the first, both from her
      correspondence and her conversation. “She has more common sense than any woman I ever knew,
      and more,” he would add, “than most men. If she were not so handsome, people would find it
      out; but they cannot understand that so beautiful a woman can have a headpiece, that, I really
      believe, could manage the affairs in Bishopsgate Street.”</p>
     <p>In the meantime life at Hainault resumed its usual course; streams of guests, of all
      parties, colours, and classes, and even nations. Sometimes Mr. Neuchatel would say, “I really
      must have a quiet day that Miss Ferrars may dine with us, and she shall ask her brother. How
      glad I shall be when she goes into half-mourning! I scarcely catch a glimpse of her.” And all
      this time his wife and daughter did nothing but quote her, which was still more irritating,
      for, as he would say, half-grumbling and half-smiling, “If it had not been for me she would
      not have been here.”</p>
     <p>At first Adriana would not dine at table without Myra, and insisted on sharing her
      imprisonment. “It does not look like a cell,” said Myra, surveying, not without complacency,
      her beautiful little chamber, beautifully lit, with its silken hangings and carved ceiling and
      bright with books and pictures; “besides, there is no reason why you should be a prisoner. You
      have not lost a father, and I hope never will.”</p>
     <p>“Amen!” said Adriana; “that would indeed be the unhappiest day of my life.”</p>
     <p>“You cannot be in society too much in the latter part of the day,” said Myra. “The mornings
      should be sacred to ourselves, but for the rest of the hours people are to see and to be seen,
      and,” she added, “to like and be liked.”</p>
     <p>Adriana shook her head; “I do not wish any one to like me but you.”</p>
     <p>“I am sure I shall always like you, and love you,” said Myra, “but I am equally sure that a
      great many other people will do the same.”</p>
     <p>“It will not be myself that they like or love,” said Adriana with a sigh.</p>
     <p>“Now, spare me that vein, dear Adriana; you know I do not like it. It is not agreeable, and
      I do not think it is true. I believe that women are loved much more for themselves than is
      supposed. Besides, a woman should be content if she is loved; that is the point; and she is
      not to inquire how far the accidents of life have contributed to the result. Why should you
      not be loved for yourself? You have an interesting appearance. I think you very pretty. You
      have choice accomplishments and agreeable conversation and the sweetest temper in the world.
      You want a little self-conceit, my dear. If I were you and admired, I should never think of my
      fortune.”</p>
     <p>“If you were the greatest heiress in the world, Myra, and were married, nobody would suppose
      for a moment that it was for your fortune.”</p>
     <p>“Go down to dinner and smile upon everybody, and tell me about your conquests to-morrow. And
      say to your dear papa, that as he is so kind as to wish to see me, I will join them after
      dinner.”</p>
     <p>And so, for the first two months, she occasionally appeared in the evening, especially when
      there was no formal party. Endymion came and visited her every Sunday, but he was also a
      social recluse, and though he had been presented to Mrs. Neuchatel and her daughter, and been
      most cordially received by them, it was some considerable time before he made the acquaintance
      of the great banker.</p>
     <p>About September Myra may be said to have formally joined the circle at Hainault. Three
      months had elapsed since the terrible event, and she felt, irrespective of other
      considerations, her position hardly justified her, notwithstanding all the indulgent kindness
      of the family, in continuing a course of life which she was conscious to them was sometimes an
      inconvenience and always a disappointment. It was impossible to deny that she was interested
      and amused by the world which she now witnessed—so energetic, so restless, so various; so full
      of urgent and pressing life; never thinking of the past and quite heedless of the future, but
      worshipping an almighty present that sometimes seemed to roll on like the car of Juggernaut.
      She was much diverted by the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange, so acute, so audacious, and
      differing so much from the merchants in the style even of their dress, and in the ease,
      perhaps the too great facility, of their bearing. They called each other by their Christian
      names, and there were allusions to practical jokes which intimated a life something between a
      public school and a garrison. On more solemn days there were diplomatists and men in political
      office; sometimes great musical artists, and occasionally a French actor. But the dinners were
      always the same; dishes worthy of the great days of the Bourbons, and wines of rarity and
      price, which could not ruin Neuchatel, for in many instances the vineyards belonged to
      himself.</p>
     <p>One morning at breakfast, when he rarely encountered them, but it was a holiday in the City,
      Mr. Neuchatel said, “There are a few gentlemen coming to dine here to-day whom you know, with
      one exception. He is a young man, a very nice young fellow. I have seen a good deal of him of
      late on business in the City, and have taken a fancy to him. He is a foreigner, but he was
      partly educated in this country and speaks English as well as any of us.”</p>
     <p>“Then I suppose he is not a Frenchman,” said Mrs. Neuchatel, “for they never speak
      English.”</p>
     <p>“I shall not say what he is. You must all find out; I dare say Miss Ferrars will discover
      him; but, remember, you must all of you pay him great attention, for he is not a common
      person, I can assure you.”</p>
     <p>“You are mysterious, Adrian,” said his wife, “and quite pique our curiosity.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I wish somebody would pique mine,” said the banker. “These holidays in the City are
      terrible things. I think I will go after breakfast and look at the new house, and I dare say
      Miss Ferrars will be kind enough to be my companion.”</p>
     <p>Several of the visitors, fortunately for the banker whose time hung rather heavily on his
      hands, arrived an hour or so before dinner, that they might air themselves in the famous
      gardens and see some of the new plants. But the guest whom he most wished to greet, and whom
      the ladies were most curious to welcome, did not arrive. They had all entered the house and
      the critical moment was at hand, when, just as dinner was about to be announced, the servants
      ushered in a young man of distinguished appearance, and the banker exclaimed, “You have
      arrived just in time to take Mrs. Neuchatel in to dinner,” and he presented to her—COLONEL
      ALBERT.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXIII</head>
     <p>The ladies were much interested by Colonel Albert. Mrs. Neuchatel exercised on him all the
      unrivalled arts by which she so unmistakably discovered character. She threw on him her brown
      velvet eyes with a subdued yet piercing beam, which would penetrate his most secret and even
      undeveloped intelligence. She asked questions in a hushed mystical voice, and as the colonel
      was rather silent and somewhat short in his replies, though ever expressed in a voice of
      sensibility and with refined deference of manner, Mrs. Neuchatel opened her own peculiar views
      on a variety of subjects of august interest, such as education, high art, the influence of
      women in society, the formation of character, and the distribution of wealth, on all of which
      this highly gifted lady was always in the habit of informing her audience, by way of
      accompaniment, that she was conscious that the views she entertained were peculiar. The views
      of Mrs. Neuchatel were peculiar, and therefore not always, or even easily, comprehended. That
      indeed she felt was rather her fate in life, but a superior intelligence like hers has a
      degree of sublimated self-respect which defies destiny.</p>
     <p>When she was alone with the ladies, the bulletin of Mrs. Neuchatel was not so copious as had
      been expected. She announced that Colonel Albert was sentimental, and she suspected a poet.
      But for the rest she had discovered nothing, not even his nationality. She had tried him both
      in French and German, but he persisted in talking English, although he spoke of himself as a
      foreigner. After dinner he conversed chiefly with the men, particularly with the Governor of
      the Bank, who seemed to interest him much, and a director of one of the dock companies, who
      offered to show him over their establishment, an offer which Colonel Albert eagerly accepted.
      Then, as if he remembered that homage was due at such a moment to the fairer sex, he went and
      seated himself by Adriana, and was playful and agreeable, though when she was cross-examined
      afterwards by her friends as to the character of his conversation, she really could not recall
      anything particular except that he was fond of horses, and said that he should like very much
      to take a ride with her. Just before he took his departure, Colonel Albert addressed Myra, and
      in a rather strange manner. He said, “I have been puzzling myself all dinner, but I cannot
      help feeling that we have met before.”</p>
     <p>Myra shook her head and said, “I think that is impossible.”</p>
     <p>“Well,” said the colonel with a look a little perplexed and not altogether satisfied, “I
      suppose then it was a dream. May dreams so delightful,” and he bowed, “never be wanting!”</p>
     <p>“So you think he is a poet, Emily,” said Mr. Neuchatel when they had all gone. “We have got
      a good many of his papers in Bishopsgate Street, but I have not met with any verses in them
      yet.”</p>
     <p>The visit of Colonel Albert was soon repeated, and he became a rather frequent guest at
      Hainault. It was evident that he was a favourite with Mr. Neuchatel. “He knows very few
      people,” he would say, “and I wish him to make some friends. Poor young fellow: he has had
      rather a hard life of it, and seen some service for such a youth. He is a perfect gentleman,
      and if he be a poet, Emily, that is all in your way. You like literary people, and are always
      begging that I should ask them. Well, next Saturday you will have a sort of a lion—one of the
      principal writers in ‘Scaramouch.’ He is going to Paris as the foreign correspondent of the
      ‘Chuck-Farthing,’ with a thousand a year, and one of my friends in the Stock Exchange, who is
      his great ally, asked me to give him some letters. So he came to Bishopsgate Street—they all
      come to Bishopsgate Street—and I asked him to dine here on Saturday. By the by, Miss Ferrars,
      ask your brother to come on the same day and stay with us till Monday. I will take him up to
      town with me quite in time for his office.”</p>
     <p>This was the first time that Endymion had remained at Hainault. He looked forward to the
      visit with anticipation of great pleasure. Hainault, and all the people there, and everything
      about it, delighted him, and most of all the happiness of his sister and the consideration,
      and generosity, and delicate affection with which she was treated. One morning, to his
      astonishment, Myra had insisted upon his accepting from her no inconsiderable sum of money.
      “It is no part of my salary,” she said, when he talked of her necessities. “Mr. Neuchatel said
      he gave it to me for outfit and to buy gloves. But being in mourning I want to buy nothing,
      and you, dear darling, must have many wants. Besides, Mrs. Neuchatel has made me so many
      presents that I really do not think that I shall ever want to buy anything again.”</p>
     <p>It was rather a grand party at Hainault, such as Endymion had little experience of. There
      was a cabinet minister and his wife, not only an ambassador, but an ambassadress who had been
      asked to meet them, a nephew Neuchatel, the M.P. with a pretty young wife, and several
      apparently single gentlemen of note and position. Endymion was nervous when he entered, and
      more so because Myra was not in the room. But his trepidation was absorbed in his amazement
      when in the distance he observed St. Barbe, with a very stiff white cravat, and his hair
      brushed into unnatural order, and his whole demeanour forming a singular contrast to the
      rollicking cynicisms of Joe’s and the office.</p>
     <p>Mr. Neuchatel presented St. Barbe to the lady of the mansion. “Here is one of our greatest
      wits,” said the banker, “and he is going to Paris, which is the capital of wits.” The critical
      moment prevented prolonged conversation, but the lady of the mansion did contrive to convey to
      St. Barbe her admiring familiarity with some of his effusions, and threw out a phrase which
      proved how finely she could distinguish between wit and humour.</p>
     <p>Endymion at dinner sate between two M.P.‘s, whom his experience at the House of Commons
      allowed him to recognise. As he was a young man whom neither of them knew, neither of them
      addressed him, but with delicate breeding carried on an active conversation across him, as if
      in fact he were not present. As Endymion had very little vanity, this did not at all annoy
      him. On the contrary, he was amused, for they spoke of matters with which he was not
      unacquainted, though he looked as if he knew or heard nothing. Their conversation was what is
      called “shop:” all about the House and office; criticisms on speakers, speculations as to
      preferment, what Government would do about this, and how well Government got out of that.</p>
     <p>Endymion was amused by seeing Myra, who was remote from him, sitting by St. Barbe, who,
      warmed by the banquet, was evidently holding forth without the slightest conception that his
      neighbour whom he addressed had long become familiar with his characteristics.</p>
     <p>After dinner St. Barbe pounced upon Endymion. “Only think of our meeting here!” he said. “I
      wonder why they asked you. You are not going to Paris, and you are not a wit. What a family
      this is!” he said; “I had no idea of wealth before! Did you observe the silver plate? I could
      not hold mine with one hand, it was so heavy. I do not suppose there are such plates in the
      world. It gives one an idea of the galleons and Anson’s plunder. But they deserve their
      wealth,” he added, “nobody grudges it to them. I declare when I was eating that truffle, I
      felt a glow about my heart that, if it were not indigestion, I think must have been gratitude;
      though that is an article I had not believed in. He is a wonderful man, that Neuchatel. If I
      had only known him a year ago! I would have dedicated my novel to him. He is a sort of man who
      would have given you a cheque immediately. He would not have read it, to be sure, but what of
      that? If you had dedicated it to a lord, the most he would have done would have been to ask
      you to dinner, and then perhaps cut up your work in one of the Quality reviews, and taken
      money for doing it out of our pockets! Oh! it’s too horrid! There are some topsawyers here
      to-day, Ferrars! It would make Seymour Hicks’ mouth water to be here. We should have had it in
      the papers, and he would have left us out of the list, and called us, etc. Now I dare say that
      ambassador has been blundering all his life, and yet there is something in that star and
      ribbon; I do not know how you feel, but I could almost go down on my knees to him. And there
      is a cabinet minister; well, we know what he is; I have been squibbing him for these two
      years, and now that I meet him I feel like a snob. Oh! there is an immense deal of
      superstition left in the world. I am glad they are going to the ladies. I am to be honoured by
      some conversation with the mistress of the house. She seems a first-rate woman, familiar with
      the glorious pages of a certain classic work, and my humble effusions. She praised one she
      thought I wrote, but between ourselves it was written by that fellow Seymour Hicks, who
      imitates me; but I would not put her right, as dinner might have been announced every moment.
      But she is a great woman, sir,—wonderful eyes! They are all great women here. I sat next to
      one of the daughters, or daughters-in-law, or nieces, I suppose. By Jove! it was tierce and
      quart. If you had been there, you would have been run through in a moment. I had to show my
      art. Now they are rising. I should not be surprised if Mr. Neuchatel were to present me to
      some of the grandees. I believe them to be all impostors, but still it is pleasant to talk to
      a man with a star.</p>
     <p>“‘Ye stars, which are the poetry of heaven,’</p>
     <p>“Byron wrote; a silly line; he should have written,</p>
     <p>“‘Ye stars, which are the poetry of dress.’”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXIV</head>
     <p>St. Barbe was not disappointed in his hopes. It was an evening of glorious success for him.
      He had even the honour of sitting for a time by the side of Mrs. Neuchatel, and being full of
      good claret, he, as he phrased it, showed his paces; that is to say, delivered himself of some
      sarcastic paradoxes duly blended with fulsome flattery. Later in the evening, he contrived to
      be presented both to the ambassador and the cabinet minister, and treated them as if they were
      demigods; listened to them as if with an admiration which he vainly endeavoured to repress;
      never spoke except to enforce and illustrate the views which they had condescended to
      intimate; successfully conveyed to his excellency that he was conversing with an enthusiast
      for his exalted profession; and to the minister that he had met an ardent sympathiser with his
      noble career. The ambassador was not dissatisfied with the impression he had made on one of
      the foreign correspondents of the “Chuck-Farthing,” and the minister flattered himself that
      both the literary and the graphic representations of himself in “Scaramouch” might possibly
      for the future be mitigated.</p>
     <p>“I have done business to-night,” said St. Barbe to Endymion, towards the close of the
      evening. “You did not know I had left the old shop? I kept it close. I could stand it no
      longer. One has energies, sir, though not recognised—at least not recognised much,” he added
      thoughtfully. “But who knows what may happen? The age of mediocrity is not eternal. You see
      this thing offered, and I saw an opening. It has come already. You saw the big-wigs all
      talking to me? I shall go to Paris now with some <hi>eclat</hi>. I shall invent a new
      profession; the literary diplomatist. The bore is, I know nothing about foreign politics. My
      line has been the other way. Never mind; I will read the ‘Debats’ and the ‘Revue des Deux
      Mondes,’ and make out something. Foreign affairs are all the future, and my views may be as
      right as anybody else’s; probably more correct, not so conventional. What a fool I was,
      Ferrars! I was asked to remain here to-night and refused! The truth is, I could not stand
      those powdered gentlemen, and I should have been under their care. They seem so haughty and
      supercilious. And yet I was wrong. I spoke to one of them very rudely just now, when he was
      handing coffee, to show I was not afraid, and he answered me like a seraph. I felt
      remorse.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I have made the acquaintance of Mr. St. Barbe,” said Myra to Endymion. “Strange as he
      is, he seemed quite familiar to me, and he was so full of himself that he never found me out.
      I hope some day to know Mr. Trenchard and Mr. Waldershare. Those I look upon as your chief
      friends.”</p>
     <p>On the following afternoon, Adriana, Myra, and Endymion took a long walk together in the
      forest. The green glades in the autumnal woods were inviting, and sometimes they stood before
      the vast form of some doddered oak. The air was fresh and the sun was bright. Adriana was
      always gay and happy in the company of her adored Myra, and her happiness and her gaiety were
      not diminished by the presence of Myra’s brother. So it was a lively and pleasant walk.</p>
     <p>At the end of a long glade they observed a horseman followed by a groom approaching them.
      Endymion was some little way behind, gathering wild flowers for Adriana. Cantering along, the
      cavalier soon reached them, and then he suddenly pulled up his horse. It was Colonel
      Albert.</p>
     <p>“You are walking, ladies? Permit me to join you,” and he was by their side. “I delight in
      forests and in green alleys,” said Colonel Albert. “Two wandering nymphs make the scene
      perfect.”</p>
     <p>“We are not alone,” said Adriana, “but our guardian is picking some wild flowers for us,
      which we fancied. I think it is time to return. You are going to Hainault, I believe, Colonel
      Albert, so we can all walk home together.”</p>
     <p>So they turned, and Endymion with his graceful offering in a moment met them. Full of his
      successful quest, he offered with eager triumph the flowers to Adriana, without casting a
      glance at her new companion.</p>
     <p>“Beautiful!” exclaimed Adriana, and she stopped to admire and arrange them. “See, dear Myra,
      is not this lovely? How superior to anything in our glass-houses!”</p>
     <p>Myra took the flower and examined it. Colonel Albert, who was silent, was watching all this
      time Endymion with intentness, who now looked up and encountered the gaze of the new comer.
      Their eyes met, their countenances were agitated, they seemed perplexed, and then it seemed
      that at the same time both extended their hands.</p>
     <p>“It is a long time since we met,” said Colonel Albert, and he retained the hand of Endymion
      with affection. But Endymion, who was apparently much moved, said nothing, or rather only
      murmured an echo to the remarks of his new friend. And then they all walked on, but Myra fell
      a little back and made a signal to Endymion to join her.</p>
     <p>“You never told me, darling, that you knew Colonel Albert.”</p>
     <p>“Colonel Albert!” said Endymion, looking amazed, and then he added, “Who is Colonel
      Albert?”</p>
     <p>“That gentleman before us,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“That is the Count of Otranto, whose fag I was at Eton.”</p>
     <p>“The Count of Otranto!”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXV</head>
     <p>Colonel Albert from this day became an object of increased and deeper interest to Myra. His
      appearance and manners had always been attractive, and the mystery connected with him was not
      calculated to diminish curiosity in his conduct or fate. But when she discovered that he was
      the unseen hero of her childhood, the being who had been kind to her Endymion in what she had
      ever considered the severest trial of her brother’s life, had been his protector from those
      who would have oppressed him, and had cherished him in the desolate hour of his delicate and
      tender boyhood, her heart was disturbed. How often had they talked together of the Count of
      Otranto, and how often had they wondered who he was! His memory had been a delightful mystery
      to them in their Berkshire solitude, and Myra recalled with a secret smile the numberless and
      ingenious inquiries by which she had endeavoured to elicit from her brother some clue as to
      his friend, or to discover some detail which might guide her to a conclusion. Endymion had
      known nothing, and was clear always that the Count of Otranto must have been, and was, an
      English boy. And now the Count of Otranto called himself Colonel Albert, and though he
      persisted in speaking English, had admitted to Mrs. Neuchatel that he was a foreigner.</p>
     <p>Who was he? She resolved, when she had an opportunity, to speak to the great banker on the
      subject.</p>
     <p>“Do you know, Mr. Neuchatel,” she said, “that Endymion, my brother, was at school with
      Colonel Albert?”</p>
     <p>“Ah, ah!” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“But when he was at school he had another name,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“Oh, oh!” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“He was then called the Count of Otranto.”</p>
     <p>“That is a very pretty name,” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“But why did he change it?” asked Myra.</p>
     <p>“The great world often change their names,” said Mr. Neuchatel. “It is only poor City men
      like myself who are always called Mr., and bear the same name as their fathers.”</p>
     <p>“But when a person is called a count when he is a boy, he is seldom called only a colonel
      when he is a man,” said Myra. “There is a great mystery in all this.”</p>
     <p>“I should not be surprised,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “if he were to change his name again before
      this time year.”</p>
     <p>“Why?” asked Myra.</p>
     <p>“Well, when I have read all his papers in Bishopsgate Street, perhaps I shall be able to
      tell you,” said Mr. Neuchatel, and Myra felt that she could pursue the theme no further.</p>
     <p>She expected that Endymion would in time be able to obtain this information, but it was not
      so. In their first private conversation after their meeting in the forest, Endymion had
      informed Colonel Albert that, though they had met now for the first time since his return,
      they had been for some time lodgers in London under the same roof. Colonel Albert smiled when
      Endymion told him this; then falling into thought, he said; “I hope we may often meet, but for
      the moment it may be as well that the past should be known only to ourselves. I wish my life
      for the present to be as private as I can arrange it. There is no reason why we should not be
      sometimes together—that is, when you have leisure. I had the pleasure of making your
      acquaintance at my banker’s.”</p>
     <p>Parliament had been dissolved through the demise of the crown in the summer of this year
      (1837), and London society had been prematurely broken up. Waldershare had left town early in
      July to secure his election, in which he was successful, with no intention of settling again
      in his old haunts till the meeting of the new House of Commons, which was to be in November.
      The Rodneys were away at some Kentish watering-place during August and September, exhibiting
      to an admiring world their exquisitely made dresses, and enjoying themselves amazingly at
      balls and assemblies at the public rooms. The resources of private society also were not
      closed to them. Mr. and Mrs. Gamme were also there and gave immense dinners, and the airy Mrs.
      Hooghley, who laughed a little at the Gammes’ substantial gatherings and herself improvised
      charming pic-nics. So there was really little embarrassment in the social relations between
      Colonel Albert and Endymion. They resolved themselves chiefly into arranging joint expeditions
      to Hainault. Endymion had a perpetual invitation there, and it seemed that the transactions
      between Mr. Neuchatel and the colonel required much conference, for the banker always expected
      him, although it was well known that they met not unfrequently in Bishopsgate Street in the
      course of the week. Colonel Albert and Endymion always stayed at Hainault from Saturday till
      Monday. It delighted the colonel to mount Endymion on one of his choice steeds, and his former
      fag enjoyed all this amazingly.</p>
     <p>Colonel Albert became domiciled at Hainault. The rooms which were occupied by him when there
      were always reserved for him. He had a general invitation, and might leave his luggage and
      books and papers behind him. It was evident that the family pleased him. Between Mr. Neuchatel
      and himself there were obviously affairs of great interest; but it was equally clear that he
      liked the female members of the family—all of them; and all liked him. And yet it cannot be
      said that he was entertaining, but there are some silent people who are more interesting than
      the best talkers. And when he did speak he always said the right thing. His manners were
      tender and gentle; he had an unobtrusive sympathy with all they said or did, except, indeed,
      and that was not rarely, when he was lost in profound abstraction.</p>
     <p>“I delight in your friend the colonel, Adrian,” said Mrs. Neuchatel, “but I must say he is
      very absent.”</p>
     <p>“He has a good deal to think about,” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“I wonder what it can be,” thought Myra.</p>
     <p>“He has a claim to a great estate,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “and he has to think of the best
      mode of establishing it; and he has been deprived of great honours, and he believes unjustly,
      and he wishes to regain them.”</p>
     <p>“No wonder, then, he is absent,” said Mrs. Neuchatel. “If he only knew what a burthen great
      wealth is, I am sure he would not wish to possess it, and as for honours I never could make
      out why having a title or a ribbon could make any difference in a human being.”</p>
     <p>“Nonsense, my dear Emily,” said Mr. Neuchatel. “Great wealth is a blessing to a man who
      knows what to do with it, and as for honours, they are inestimable to the honourable.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I ardently hope Colonel Albert may succeed,” said Myra, “because he was so kind to my
      brother at Eton. He must have a good heart.”</p>
     <p>“They say he is the most unscrupulous of living men,” said Mr. Neuchatel, with his peculiar
      smile.</p>
     <p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Mrs. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“How terrible!” said Adriana. “It cannot be true.”</p>
     <p>“Perhaps he is the most determined,” said Myra. “Moral courage is the rarest of qualities,
      and often maligned.”</p>
     <p>“Well, he has got a champion,” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“I ardently wish him success,” said Myra, “in all his undertakings. I only wish I knew what
      they were.”</p>
     <p>“Has not he told your brother, Miss Ferrars?” asked Mr. Neuchatel, with laughing eyes.</p>
     <p>“He never speaks of himself to Endymion,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“He speaks a good deal of himself to me,” said Mr. Neuchatel; “and he is going to bring a
      friend here to-morrow who knows more about his affairs even than I do. So you will have a very
      good opportunity, Miss Ferrars, of making yourself acquainted with them, particularly if you
      sit next to him at dinner, and are very winning.”</p>
     <p>The friend of Colonel Albert was Baron Sergius, the baron who used to visit him in London at
      twilight in a dark brougham. Mrs. Neuchatel was greatly taken by his appearance, by the
      calmness of his mien, his unstudied politeness, and his measured voice. He conversed with her
      entirely at dinner on German philosophy, of which he seemed a complete master, explained to
      her the different schools, and probably the successful ones, and imparted to her that precise
      knowledge which she required on the subject, and which she had otherwise been unable to
      obtain. It seemed, too, that he personally knew all the famous professors, and he intimated
      their doctrines not only with profound criticism, but described their persons and habits with
      vividness and picturesque power, never, however, all this time, by any chance raising his
      voice, the tones of which were ever distinct and a little precise.</p>
     <p>“Is this the first visit of your friend to this country?” asked Myra of Colonel Albert.</p>
     <p>“Oh no; he has been here often—and everywhere,” added Colonel Albert.</p>
     <p>“Everywhere! he must be a most interesting companion then.”</p>
     <p>“I find him so: I never knew any one whom I thought equal to him. But perhaps I am not an
      impartial judge, for I have known him so long and so intimately. In fact, I had never been out
      of his sight till I was brought over to this country to be placed at Eton. He is the
      counsellor of our family, and we all of us have ever agreed that if his advice had been always
      followed we should never have had a calamity.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed, a gifted person! Is he a soldier?”</p>
     <p>“No; Baron Sergius has not followed the profession of arms.”</p>
     <p>“He looks a diplomatist.”</p>
     <p>“Well, he is now nothing but my friend,” said the colonel. “He might have been anything, but
      he is a peculiarly domestic character, and is devoted to private life.”</p>
     <p>“You are fortunate in such a friend.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am glad to be fortunate in something,” said Colonel Albert.</p>
     <p>“And are you not fortunate in everything?”</p>
     <p>“I have not that reputation; but I shall be more than fortunate if I have your kind
      wishes.”</p>
     <p>“Those you have,” said Myra, rather eagerly. “My brother taught me, even as a child, to wish
      nothing but good for you. I wish I knew only what I was to wish for.”</p>
     <p>“Wish that my plans may succeed,” said Colonel Albert, looking round to her with
      interest.</p>
     <p>“I will more than wish,” said Myra; “I will believe that they will succeed, because I think
      you have resolved to succeed.”</p>
     <p>“I shall tell Endymion when I see him,” said Colonel Albert, “that his sister is the only
      person who has read my character.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXVI</head>
     <p>Colonel Albert and Baron Sergius drove up in their landau from Hainault while Endymion was
      at the door in Warwick Street, returning home. The colonel saluted him cordially, and said,
      “The baron is going to take a cup of coffee with me; join us.” So they went upstairs. There
      was a packet on the table, which seemed to catch the colonel’s eye immediately, and he at once
      opened it with eagerness. It contained many foreign newspapers. Without waiting for the
      servant who was about to bring candles, the colonel lighted a taper on the table with a
      lucifer, and then withdrew into the adjoining chamber, opening, however, with folding doors to
      the principal and spacious apartment.</p>
     <p>“A foreign newspaper always interests our friend,” said the baron, taking his coffee.</p>
     <p>“Well, it must always be interesting to have news from home, I suppose,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Home!” said the baron. “News is always interesting, whether it come from home or not.”</p>
     <p>“To public men,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“To all men if they be wise,” said the baron; “as a general rule, the most successful man in
      life is the man who has the best information.”</p>
     <p>“But what a rare thing is success in life!” said Endymion. “I often wonder whether I shall
      ever be able to step out of the crowd.”</p>
     <p>“You may have success in life without stepping out of the crowd,” said the baron.</p>
     <p>“A sort of success,” said Endymion; “I know what you mean. But what I mean is real success
      in life. I mean, I should like to be a public man.”</p>
     <p>“Why?” asked the baron.</p>
     <p>“Well, I should like to have power,” said Endymion, blushing.</p>
     <p>“The most powerful men are not public men,” said the baron. “A public man is responsible,
      and a responsible man is a slave. It is private life that governs the world. You will find
      this out some day. The world talks much of powerful sovereigns and great ministers; and if
      being talked about made one powerful, they would be irresistible. But the fact is, the more
      you are talked about the less powerful you are.”</p>
     <p>“But surely King Luitbrand is a powerful monarch; they say he is the wisest of men. And the
      Emperor Harold, who has succeeded in everything. And as for ministers, who is a great man if
      it be not Prince Wenceslaus?”</p>
     <p>“King Luitbrand is governed by his doctor, who is capable of governing Europe, but has no
      ambition that way; the Emperor Harold is directed by his mistress, who is a woman of a certain
      age with a vast sagacity, but who also believes in sorcery; and as for Prince Wenceslaus, he
      is inspired by an individual as obscure as ourselves, and who, for aught I know, may be, at
      this moment, like ourselves, drinking a cup of coffee in a hired lodging.”</p>
     <p>“What you say about public life amazes me,” said Endymion musingly.</p>
     <p>“Think over it,” said the baron. “As an Englishman, you will have difficulty in avoiding
      public life. But at any rate do not at present be discontented that you are unknown. It is the
      first condition of real power. When you have succeeded in life according to your views, and I
      am inclined to believe you will so succeed, you will, some day, sigh for real power, and
      denounce the time when you became a public man, and belonged to any one but yourself. But our
      friend calls me. He has found something startling. I will venture to say, if there be anything
      in it, it has been brought about by some individual of whom you never heard.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXVII</head>
     <p>With the assembling of parliament in November recommenced the sittings of the Union Society,
      of which Endymion had for some time been a member, and of whose meetings he was a constant and
      critical, though silent, attendant. There was a debate one night on the government of
      dependencies, which, although all reference to existing political circumstances was rigidly
      prohibited, no doubt had its origin in the critical state of one of our most important
      colonies, then much embarrassing the metropolis. The subject was one which Endymion had
      considered, and on which he had arrived at certain conclusions. The meeting was fully
      attended, and the debate had been conducted with a gravity becoming the theme. Endymion was
      sitting on a back bench, and with no companion near him with whom he was acquainted, when he
      rose and solicited the attention of the president. Another and a well-known speaker had also
      risen, and been called, but there was a cry of “new member,” a courteous cry, borrowed from
      the House of Commons, and Endymion for the first time heard his own voice in public. He has
      since admitted, though he has been through many trying scenes, that it was the most nervous
      moment of his life. “After Calais,” as a wise wit said, “nothing surprises;” and the first
      time a man speaks in public, even if only at a debating society, is also the unequalled
      incident in its way. The indulgence of the audience supported him while the mist cleared from
      his vision, and his palpitating heart subsided into comparative tranquillity. After a few
      pardonable incoherencies, he was launched into his subject, and spoke with the thoughtful
      fluency which knowledge alone can sustain. For knowledge is the foundation of eloquence.</p>
     <p>“What a good-looking young fellow!” whispered Mr. Bertie Tremaine to his brother Mr.
      Tremaine Bertie. The Bertie Tremaines were the two greatest swells of the Union, and had a
      party of their own. “And he speaks well.”</p>
     <p>“Who is he?” inquired Mr. Tremaine Bertie of their other neighbour.</p>
     <p>“He is a clerk in the Treasury, I believe, or something of that sort,” was the reply.</p>
     <p>“I never saw such a good-looking young fellow,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine. “He is worth
      getting hold of. I shall ask to be introduced to him when we break up.”</p>
     <p>Accordingly, Mr. Bertie Tremaine, who was always playing at politics, and who, being
      two-and-twenty, was discontented he was not Chancellor of the Exchequer like Mr. Pitt,
      whispered to a gentleman who sate behind him, and was, in short, the whip of his section, and
      signified, as a minister of state would, that an introduction to Mr. Ferrars should be
      arranged.</p>
     <p>So when the meeting broke up, of which Mr. Ferrars’ maiden speech was quite the event, and
      while he was contemplating, not without some fair self-complacency, walking home with
      Trenchard, Endymion found himself encompassed by a group of bowing forms and smiling
      countenances, and, almost before he was aware of it, had made the acquaintance of the great
      Mr. Bertie Tremaine, and received not only the congratulations of that gentleman, but an
      invitation to dine with him on the morrow; “quite <hi>sans facon</hi>.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Bertie Tremaine, who had early succeeded to the family estate, lived in Grosvenor
      Street, and in becoming style. His house was furnished with luxury and some taste. The host
      received his guests in a library, well stored with political history and political science,
      and adorned with the busts of celebrated statesmen and of profound political sages. Bentham
      was the philosopher then affected by young gentleman of ambition, and who wished to have
      credit for profundity and hard heads. Mr. Bertie Tremaine had been the proprietor of a close
      borough, which for several generations had returned his family to parliament, the faithful
      supporters of Pitt, and Perceval, and Liverpool, and he had contemplated following the same
      line, though with larger and higher objects than his ancestors. Being a man of considerable
      and versatile ability, and of ample fortune, with the hereditary opportunity which he
      possessed, he had a right to aspire, and, as his vanity more than equalled his talents, his
      estimate of his own career was not mean. Unfortunately, before he left Harrow, he was deprived
      of his borough, and this catastrophe eventually occasioned a considerable change in the views
      and conduct of Mr. Bertie Tremaine. In the confusion of parties and political thought which
      followed the Reform Act of Lord Grey, an attempt to govern the country by the assertion of
      abstract principles, and which it was now beginning to be the fashion to call Liberalism,
      seemed the only opening to public life; and Mr. Bertie Tremaine, who piqued himself on
      recognising the spirit of the age, adopted Liberal opinions with that youthful fervour which
      is sometimes called enthusiasm, but which is a heat of imagination subsequently discovered to
      be inconsistent with the experience of actual life. At Cambridge Mr. Bertie Tremaine was at
      first the solitary pupil of Bentham, whose principles he was prepared to carry to their
      extreme consequences, but being a man of energy and in possession of a good estate, he soon
      found followers, for the sympathies of youth are quick, and, even with an original bias, it is
      essentially mimetic. When Mr. Bertie Tremaine left the university he found in the
      miscellaneous elements of the London Union many of his former companions of school and
      college, and from them, and the new world to which he was introduced, it delighted him to form
      parties and construct imaginary cabinets. His brother Augustus, who was his junior only by a
      year, and was destined to be a diplomatist, was an efficient assistant in these enterprises,
      and was one of the guests who greeted Endymion when he arrived next day in Grosvenor Street
      according to his engagement. The other three were Hortensius, the whip of the party, and Mr.
      Trenchard.</p>
     <p>The dinner was refined, for Mr. Bertie Tremaine combined the Sybarite with the Utilitarian
      sage, and it secretly delighted him to astonish or embarrass an austere brother republican by
      the splendour of his family plate or the polished appointments of his household. To-day the
      individual to be influenced was Endymion, and the host, acting up to his ideal of a first
      minister, addressed questions to his companions on the subjects which were peculiarly their
      own, and, after eliciting their remarks, continued to complete the treatment of the theme with
      adequate ability, though in a manner authoritative, and, as Endymion thought, a little
      pompous. What amused him most in this assemblage of youth was their earnest affectation of
      public life. The freedom of their comments on others was only equalled by their confidence in
      themselves. Endymion, who only spoke when he was appealed to, had casually remarked in answer
      to one of the observations which his host with elaborate politeness occasionally addressed to
      him, that he thought it was unpatriotic to take a certain course. Mr. Bertie Tremaine
      immediately drew up, and said, with a deep smile, “that he comprehended philanthropy, but
      patriotism he confessed he did not understand;” and thereupon delivered himself of an address
      on the subject which might have been made in the Union, and which communicated to the
      astonished Endymion that patriotism was a false idea, and entirely repugnant to the principles
      of the new philosophy. As all present were more or less impregnated with these tenets, there
      was no controversy on the matter. Endymion remained discreetly silent, and Augustus—Mr. Bertie
      Tremaine’s brother—who sate next to him, and whose manners were as sympathising as his
      brother’s were autocratic, whispered in a wheedling tone that it was quite true, and that the
      idea of patriotism was entirely relinquished except by a few old-fashioned folks who clung to
      superstitious phrases. Hortensius, who seemed to be the only one of the company who presumed
      to meet Mr. Bertie Tremaine in conversation on equal terms, and who had already astonished
      Endymion by what that inexperienced youth deemed the extreme laxity of his views, both social
      and political, evinced, more than once, a disposition to deviate into the lighter topics of
      feminine character, and even the fortunes of the hazard-table; but the host looked severe, and
      was evidently resolved that the conversation to-day should resemble the expression of his
      countenance. After dinner they returned to the library, and most of them smoked, but Mr.
      Bertie Tremaine, inviting Endymion to seat himself by his side on a sofa at the farther end of
      the room, observed, “I suppose you are looking to parliament?”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not know,” said the somewhat startled Endymion; “I have not thought much about
      it, and I have not yet reached a parliamentary age.”</p>
     <p>“A man cannot enter parliament too soon,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine; “I hope to enter this
      session. There will be a certain vacancy on a petition, and I have arranged to have the
      seat.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed!” said Endymion. “My father was in parliament, and so was my grandfather, but I
      confess I do not very well see my way there.”</p>
     <p>“You must connect yourself with a party,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine, “and you will soon
      enter; and being young, you should connect yourself with the party of the future. The country
      is wearied with the present men, who have no philosophical foundation, and are therefore
      perpetually puzzled and inconsistent, and the country will not stand the old men, as it is
      resolved against retrogression. The party of the future and of the speedy future has its
      headquarters under this roof, and I should like to see you belong to it.”</p>
     <p>“You are too kind,” murmured Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Yes, I see in you the qualities adapted to public life, and which may be turned to great
      account. I must get you into parliament as soon as you are eligible,” continued Mr. Bertie
      Tremaine in a musing tone. “This death of the King was very inopportune. If he had reigned a
      couple of years more, I saw my way to half a dozen seats, and I could have arranged with Lord
      Durham.”</p>
     <p>“That was unfortunate,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“What do you think of Hortensius?” inquired Mr. Bertie Tremaine.</p>
     <p>“I think him the most brilliant speaker I know,” said Endymion. “I never met him in private
      society before; he talks well.”</p>
     <p>“He wants conduct,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine. “He ought to be my Lord Chancellor, but there
      is a tone of levity about him which is unfortunate. Men destined to the highest places should
      beware of badinage.”</p>
     <p>“I believe it is a dangerous weapon.”</p>
     <p>“All lawyers are loose in their youth, but an insular country subject to fogs, and with a
      powerful middle class, requires grave statesmen. I attribute a great deal of the nonsense
      called Conservative Reaction to Peel’s solemnity. The proper minister for England at this
      moment would be Pitt. Extreme youth gives hope to a country; coupled with ceremonious manners,
      hope soon assumes the form of confidence.”</p>
     <p>“Ah!” murmured Endymion.</p>
     <p>“I had half a mind to ask Jawett to dinner to-day. His powers are unquestionable, but he is
      not a practical man. For instance, I think myself our colonial empire is a mistake, and that
      we should disembarrass ourselves of its burthen as rapidly as is consistent with the dignity
      of the nation; but were Jawett in the House of Commons to-morrow, nothing would satisfy him
      but a resolution for the total and immediate abolition of the empire, with a preamble
      denouncing the folly of our fathers in creating it. Jawett never spares any one’s
      self-love.”</p>
     <p>“I know him very well,” said Endymion; “he is in my office. He is very uncompromising.”</p>
     <p>“Yes,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine musingly; “if I had to form a government, I could hardly
      offer him the cabinet.” Then speaking more rapidly, he added, “The man you should attach
      yourself to is my brother Augustus—Mr. Tremaine Bertie. There is no man who understands
      foreign politics like Augustus, and he is a thorough man of the world.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII</head>
     <p>When parliament reassembled in February, the Neuchatels quitted Hainault for their London
      residence in Portland Place. Mrs. Neuchatel was sadly troubled at leaving her country home,
      which, notwithstanding its distressing splendour, had still some forms of compensatory
      innocence in its flowers and sylvan glades. Adriana sighed when she called to mind the
      manifold and mortifying snares and pitfalls that awaited her, and had even framed a highly
      practical and sensible scheme which would permit her parents to settle in town and allow Myra
      and herself to remain permanently in the country; but Myra brushed away the project like a
      fly, and Adriana yielding, embraced her with tearful eyes.</p>
     <p>The Neuchatel mansion in Portland Place was one of the noblest in that comely quarter of the
      town, and replete with every charm and convenience that wealth and taste could provide. Myra,
      who, like her brother, had a tenacious memory, was interested in recalling as fully and as
      accurately as possible her previous experience of London life. She was then indeed only a
      child, but a child who was often admitted to brilliant circles, and had enjoyed opportunities
      of social observation which the very youthful seldom possess. Her retrospection was not as
      profitable as she could have desired, and she was astonished, after a severe analysis of the
      past, to find how entirely at that early age she appeared to have been engrossed with herself
      and with Endymion. Hill Street and Wimbledon, and all their various life, figured as shadowy
      scenes; she could realise nothing very definite for her present guidance; the past seemed a
      phantom of fine dresses, and bright equipages, and endless indulgence. All that had happened
      after their fall was distinct and full of meaning. It would seem that adversity had taught
      Myra to feel and think.</p>
     <p>Forty years ago the great financiers had not that commanding, not to say predominant,
      position in society which they possess at present, but the Neuchatels were an exception to
      this general condition. They were a family which not only had the art of accumulating wealth,
      but of expending it with taste and generosity—an extremely rare combination. Their great
      riches, their political influence, their high integrity and their social accomplishments,
      combined to render their house not only splendid, but interesting and agreeable, and gave them
      a great hold upon the world. At first the fine ladies of their political party called on them
      as a homage of condescending gratitude for the public support which the Neuchatel family gave
      to their sons and husbands, but they soon discovered that this amiable descent from their
      Olympian heights on their part did not amount exactly to the sacrifice or service which they
      had contemplated. They found their host as refined as themselves, and much more magnificent,
      and in a very short time it was not merely the wives of ambassadors and ministers of state
      that were found at the garden fetes of Hainault, or the balls, and banquets, and concerts of
      Portland Place, but the fitful and capricious realm of fashion surrendered like a fair country
      conquered as it were by surprise. To visit the Neuchatels became the mode; all solicited to be
      their guests, and some solicited in vain.</p>
     <p>Although it was only February, the world began to move, and some of the ministers’ wives,
      who were socially strong enough to venture on such a step, received their friends. Mr.
      Neuchatel particularly liked this form of society. “I cannot manage balls,” he used to say,
      “but I like a ministerial reception. There is some chance of sensible conversation and doing a
      little business. I like talking with ambassadors after dinner. Besides, in this country you
      meet the leaders of the opposition, because, as they are not invited by the minister, but by
      his wife, anybody can come without committing himself.”</p>
     <p>Myra, faithful to her original resolution, not to enter society while she was in mourning,
      declined all the solicitudes of her friends to accompany them to these assemblies. Mrs.
      Neuchatel always wished Myra should be her substitute, and it was only at Myra’s instance that
      Adriana accompanied her parents. In the meantime, Myra saw much of Endymion. He was always a
      welcome guest by the family, and could call upon his sister at all the odds and ends of time
      that were at his command, and chat with her at pleasant ease in her pretty room. Sometimes
      they walked out together, and sometimes they went together to see some exhibition that
      everybody went to see. Adriana became almost as intimate with Endymion as his sister, and
      altogether the Neuchatel family became by degrees to him as a kind of home. Talking with
      Endymion, Myra heard a good deal of Colonel Albert, for he was her brother’s hero—but she
      rarely saw that gentleman. She was aware from her brother, and from some occasional words of
      Mr. Neuchatel, that the great banker still saw Colonel Albert and not unfrequently, but the
      change of residence from Hainault to London made a difference in their mode of communication.
      Business was transacted in Bishopsgate Street, and no longer combined with a pleasant ride to
      an Essex forest. More than once Colonel Albert had dined in Portland Place, but at irregular
      and miscellaneous parties. Myra observed that he was never asked to meet the grand personages
      who attended the celebrated banquets of Mr. Neuchatel. And why not? His manners were
      distinguished, but his whole bearing that of one accustomed to consideration. The
      irrepressible curiosity of woman impelled her once to feel her way on the subject with Mr.
      Neuchatel, but with the utmost dexterity and delicacy.</p>
     <p>“No,” said Mr. Neuchatel with a laughing eye, and who saw through everybody’s purpose,
      though his own manner was one of simplicity amounting almost to innocence, “I did not say
      Colonel Albert was going to dine here on Wednesday; I have asked him to dine here on Sunday.
      On Wednesday I am going to have the premier and some of his colleagues. I must insist upon
      Miss Ferrars dining at table. You will meet Lord Roehampton; all the ladies admire him and he
      admires all the ladies. It will not do to ask Colonel Albert to meet such a party, though
      perhaps,” added Mr. Neuchatel with a merry smile, “some day they may be asked to meet Colonel
      Albert. Who knows, Miss Ferrars? The wheel of Fortune turns round very strangely.”</p>
     <p>“And who then is Colonel Albert?” asked Myra with decision.</p>
     <p>“Colonel Albert is Colonel Albert, and nobody else, so far as I know,” replied Mr.
      Neuchatel; “he has brought a letter of credit on my house in that name, and I am happy to
      honour his drafts to the amount in question, and as he is a foreigner, I think it is but kind
      and courteous occasionally to ask him to dinner.”</p>
     <p>Miss Ferrars did not pursue the inquiry, for she was sufficiently acquainted with Mr.
      Neuchatel to feel that he did not intend to gratify her curiosity.</p>
     <p>The banquet of the Neuchatels to the premier, and some of the principal ambassadors and
      their wives, and to those of the premier’s colleagues who were fashionable enough to be asked,
      and to some of the dukes and duchesses and other ethereal beings who supported the ministry,
      was the first event of the season. The table blazed with rare flowers and rarer porcelain and
      precious candelabra of sculptured beauty glittering with light; the gold plate was less
      remarkable than the delicate ware that had been alike moulded and adorned for a Du Barri or a
      Marie Antoinette, and which now found a permanent and peaceful home in the proverbial land of
      purity and order; and amid the stars and ribbons, not the least remarkable feature of the
      whole was Mr. Neuchatel himself, seated at the centre of his table, alike free from
      ostentation or over-deference, talking to the great ladies on each side of him, as if he had
      nothing to do in life but whisper in gentle ears, and partaking of his own dainties as if he
      were eating bread and cheese at a country inn.</p>
     <p>Perhaps Mrs. Neuchatel might have afforded a companion picture. Partly in deference to their
      host, and partly because this evening the first dance of the season was to be given, the great
      ladies in general wore their diamonds, and Myra was amused as she watched their dazzling
      tiaras and flashing rivieres, while not a single ornament adorned the graceful presence of
      their hostess, who was more content to be brilliant only by her conversation. As Mr. Neuchatel
      had only a few days before presented his wife with another diamond necklace, he might be
      excused were he slightly annoyed. Nothing of the sort; he only shrugged his shoulders, and
      said to his nephew, “Your aunt must feel that I give her diamonds from love and not from
      vanity, as she never lets me have the pleasure of seeing them.” The sole ornament of Adriana
      was an orchid, which had arrived that morning from Hainault, and she had presented its fellow
      to Myra.</p>
     <p>There was one lady who much attracted the attention of Myra, interested in all she observed.
      This lady was evidently a person of importance, for she sate between an ambassador and a
      knight of the garter, and they vied in homage to her. They watched her every word, and seemed
      delighted with all she said. Without being strictly beautiful, there was an expression of
      sweet animation in her physiognomy which was highly attractive: her eye was full of summer
      lightning, and there was an arch dimple in her smile, which seemed to irradiate her whole
      countenance. She was quite a young woman, hardly older than Myra. What most distinguished her
      was the harmony of her whole person; her graceful figure, her fair and finely moulded
      shoulders, her pretty teeth, and her small extremities, seemed to blend with and become the
      soft vivacity of her winning glance.</p>
     <p>“Lady Montfort looks well to-night,” said the neighbour of Myra.</p>
     <p>“And is that Lady Montfort? Do you know, I never saw her before.”</p>
     <p>“Yes; that is the famous Berengaria, the Queen of Society, and the genius of Whiggism.”</p>
     <p>In the evening, a great lady, who was held to have the finest voice in society, favoured
      them with a splendid specimen of her commanding skill, and then Adriana was induced to gratify
      her friends with a song, “only one song,” and that only on condition that Myra should
      accompany her. Miss Neuchatel had a sweet and tender voice, and it had been finely cultivated;
      she would have been more than charming if she had only taken interest in anything she herself
      did, or believed for a moment that she could interest others. When she ceased, a gentleman
      approached the instrument and addressed her in terms of sympathy and deferential praise. Myra
      recognised the knight of the garter who had sat next to Lady Montfort. He was somewhat
      advanced in middle life, tall and of a stately presence, with a voice more musical even than
      the tones which had recently enchanted every one. His countenance was impressive, a truly
      Olympian brow, but the lower part of the face indicated not feebleness, but flexibility, and
      his mouth was somewhat sensuous. His manner was at once winning; natural, and singularly
      unaffected, and seemed to sympathise entirely with those whom he addressed.</p>
     <p>“But I have never been at Hainault,” said the gentleman, continuing a conversation, “and
      therefore could not hear the nightingales. I am content you have brought one of them to
      town.”</p>
     <p>“Nightingales disappear in June,” said Miss Ferrars; “so our season will be short.”</p>
     <p>“And where do they travel to?” asked the gentleman.</p>
     <p>“Ah! that is a mystery,” said Myra. “You must ask Miss Neuchatel.”</p>
     <p>“But she will not tell me,” said the gentleman, for in truth Miss Neuchatel, though he had
      frequently addressed her, had scarcely opened her lips.</p>
     <p>“Tell your secret, Adriana,” said Miss Ferrars, trying to force her to converse.</p>
     <p>“Adriana!” said the gentleman. “What a beautiful name! You look with that flower, Miss
      Neuchatel, like a bride of Venice.”</p>
     <p>“Nay,” said Myra; “the bride of Venice was a stormy ocean.”</p>
     <p>“And have you a Venetian name?” asked the gentleman.</p>
     <p>There was a pause, and then Miss Neuchatel, with an effort, murmured, “She has a very pretty
      name. Her name is Myra.”</p>
     <p>“She seems to deserve it,” said the gentleman.</p>
     <p>“So you like my daughter’s singing,” said Mr. Neuchatel, coming up to them. “She does not
      much like singing in public, but she is a very good girl, and always gives me a song when I
      come home from business.”</p>
     <p>“Fortunate man!” said the gentleman. “I wish somebody would sing to me when I come home from
      business.”</p>
     <p>“You should marry, my lord,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “and get your wife to sing to you. Is it
      not so, Miss Ferrars? By the by, I ought to introduce you to—Lord Roehampton.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXIX</head>
     <p>The Earl of Roehampton was the strongest member of the government, except, of course, the
      premier himself. He was the man from whose combined force and flexibility of character the
      country had confidence that in all their councils there would be no lack of courage, yet
      tempered with adroit discretion. Lord Roehampton, though an Englishman, was an Irish peer, and
      was resolved to remain so, for he fully appreciated the position, which united social
      distinction with the power of a seat in the House of Commons. He was a very ambitious, and, as
      it was thought, worldly man, deemed even by many to be unscrupulous, and yet he was romantic.
      A great favourite in society, and especially with the softer sex, somewhat late in life, he
      had married suddenly a beautiful woman, who was without fortune, and not a member of the
      enchanted circle in which he flourished. The union had been successful, for Lord Roehampton
      was gifted with a sweet temper, and, though people said he had no heart, with a winning
      tenderness of disposition, or at least of manner, which at the same time charmed and soothed.
      He had been a widower for two years, and the world was of opinion that he ought to marry
      again, and form this time a becoming alliance. In addition to his many recommendations he had
      now the inestimable reputation, which no one had ever contemplated for him, of having been a
      good husband.</p>
     <p>Berengaria, Countess of Montfort, was a great friend of Lord Roehampton. She was accustomed
      to describe herself as “the last of his conquests,” and though Lord Roehampton read characters
      and purposes with a glance, and was too sagacious to be deceived by any one, even by himself,
      his gratified taste, for he scarcely had vanity, cherished the bright illusion of which he was
      conscious, and he responded to Lady Montfort half sportively, half seriously, with an air of
      flattered devotion. Lord Roehampton had inherited an ample estate, and he had generally been
      in office; for he served his apprenticeship under Perceval and Liverpool, and changed his
      party just in time to become a member of the Cabinet of 1831. Yet with all these advantages,
      whether it were the habit of his life, which was ever profuse, or that neglect of his private
      interests which almost inevitably accompanies the absorbing duties of public life, his affairs
      were always somewhat confused, and Lady Montfort, who wished to place him on a pinnacle, had
      resolved that he should marry an heiress. After long observation and careful inquiry and
      prolonged reflection, the lady she had fixed upon was Miss Neuchatel; and she it was who had
      made Lord Roehampton cross the room and address Adriana after her song.</p>
     <p>“He is not young,” reasoned Lady Montfort to herself, “but his mind and manner are young,
      and that is everything. I am sure I meet youth every day who, compared with Lord Roehampton,
      could have no chance with my sex—men who can neither feel, nor think, nor converse. And then
      he is famous, and powerful, and fashionable, and knows how to talk to women. And this must all
      tell with a banker’s daughter, dying, of course, to be a <hi>grande dame</hi>. It will do. He
      may not be young, but he is irresistible. And the father will like it, for he told me in
      confidence, at dinner, that he wished Lord Roehampton to be prime minister; and with this
      alliance he will be.”</p>
     <p>The plot being devised by a fertile brain never wanting in expedients, its development was
      skilfully managed, and its accomplishment anticipated with confidence. It was remarkable with
      what dexterity the Neuchatel family and Lord Roehampton were brought together. Berengaria’s
      lord and master was in the country, which he said he would not quit; but this did not prevent
      her giving delightful little dinners and holding select assemblies on nights when there was no
      dreadful House of Commons, and Lord Roehampton could be present. On most occasions, and
      especially on these latter ones, Lady Montfort could not endure existence without her dear
      Adriana. Mr. Neuchatel, who was a little in the plot, who at least smiled when Berengaria
      alluded to her enterprise, was not wanting in his contributions to its success. He hardly ever
      gave one of his famous banquets to which Lord Roehampton was not invited, and, strange to say,
      Lord Roehampton, who had the reputation of being somewhat difficult on this head, always
      accepted the invitations. The crowning social incident, however, was when Lord Roehampton
      opened his own house for the first time since his widowhood, and received the Neuchatels at a
      banquet not inferior to their own. This was a great triumph for Lady Montfort, who thought the
      end was at hand.</p>
     <p>“Life is short,” she said to Lord Roehampton that evening. “Why not settle it to-night?”</p>
     <p>“Well,” said Lord Roehampton, “you know I never like anything precipitate. Besides, why
      should the citadel surrender when I have hardly entered on my first parallel?”</p>
     <p>“Ah! those are old-fashioned tactics,” said Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Well, I suppose I am an old-fashioned man.”</p>
     <p>“Be serious, now. I want it settled before Easter. I must go down to my lord then, and even
      before; and I should like to see this settled before we separate.”</p>
     <p>“Why does not Montfort come up to town?” said Lord Roehampton. “He is wanted.”</p>
     <p>“Well,” said Lady Montfort, with half a sigh, “it is no use talking about it. He will not
      come. Our society bores him, and he must be amused. I write to him every day, and sometimes
      twice a day, and pass my life in collecting things to interest him. I would never leave him
      for a moment, only I know then that he would get wearied of me; and he thinks now—at least, he
      once said so—that he has never had a dull moment in my company.”</p>
     <p>“How can he find amusement in the country?” said Lord Roehampton. “There is no sport now,
      and a man cannot always be reading French novels.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I send amusing people down to him,” said Berengaria. “It is difficult to arrange, for
      he does not like toadies, which is so unreasonable, for I know many toadies who are very
      pleasant. Treeby is with him now, and that is excellent, for Treeby contradicts him, and is
      scientific as well as fashionable, and gives him the last news of the Sun as well as of
      White’s. I want to get this great African traveller to go down to him; but one can hardly send
      a perfect stranger as a guest. I wanted Treeby to take him, but Treeby refused—men are so
      selfish. Treeby could have left him there, and the traveller might have remained a week, told
      all he had seen, and as much more as he liked. My lord cannot stand Treeby more than two days,
      and Treeby cannot stand my lord for a longer period, and that is why they are such
      friends.”</p>
     <p>“A sound basis of agreement,” said Lord Roehampton. “I believe absence is often a great
      element of charm.”</p>
     <p>“But, <hi>a nos moutons</hi>,” resumed Lady Montfort. “You see now why I am so anxious for a
      conclusion of our affair. I think it is ripe?”</p>
     <p>“Why do you?” said Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“Well, she must be very much in love with you.”</p>
     <p>“Has she told you so?”</p>
     <p>“No; but she looks in love.”</p>
     <p>“She has never told me so,” said Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“Have you told her?”</p>
     <p>“Well, I have not,” said her companion. “I like the family—all of them. I like Neuchatel
      particularly. I like his house and style of living. You always meet nice people there, and
      hear the last thing that has been said or done all over the world. It is a house where you are
      sure not to be dull.”</p>
     <p>“You have described a perfect home,” said Lady Montfort, “and it awaits you.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not know,” said Lord Roehampton. “Perhaps I am fastidious, perhaps I am content;
      to be noticed sometimes by a Lady Montfort should, I think, satisfy any man.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that is gallant, but it is not business, my dear lord. You can count on my devotion
      even when you are married; but I want to see you on a pinnacle, so that if anything happens
      there shall be no question who is to be the first man in this country.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XL</head>
     <p>The meeting of parliament caused also the return of Waldershare to England, and brought life
      and enjoyment to our friends in Warwick Street. Waldershare had not taken his seat in the
      autumn session. After the general election, he had gone abroad with Lord Beaumaris, the young
      nobleman who had taken them to the Derby, and they had seen and done many strange things.
      During all their peregrinations, however, Waldershare maintained a constant correspondence
      with Imogene, occasionally sending her a choice volume, which she was not only to read, but to
      prove her perusal of it by forwarding to him a criticism of its contents.</p>
     <p>Endymion was too much pleased to meet Waldershare again, and told him of the kind of
      intimacy he had formed with Colonel Albert and all about the baron. Waldershare was much
      interested in these details, and it was arranged that an opportunity should be taken to make
      the colonel and Waldershare acquainted.</p>
     <p>This, however, was not an easy result to bring about, for Waldershare insisted on its not
      occurring formally, and as the colonel maintained the utmost reserve with the household, and
      Endymion had no room of reception, weeks passed over without Waldershare knowing more of
      Colonel Albert personally than sometimes occasionally seeing him mount his horse.</p>
     <p>In the meantime life in Warwick Street, so far as the Rodney family were concerned, appeared
      to have re-assumed its pleasant, and what perhaps we are authorised in styling its normal
      condition. They went to the play two or three times a week, and there Waldershare or Lord
      Beaumaris, frequently both, always joined them; and then they came home to supper, and then
      they smoked; and sometimes there was a little singing, and sometimes a little whist.
      Occasionally there was only conversation, that is to say, Waldershare held forth, dilating on
      some wondrous theme, full of historical anecdote, and dazzling paradox, and happy phrase. All
      listened with interest, even those who did not understand him. Much of his talk was addressed
      really to Beaumaris, whose mind he was forming, as well as that of Imogene. Beaumaris was an
      hereditary Whig, but had not personally committed himself, and the ambition of Waldershare was
      to transform him not only into a Tory, but one of the old rock, a real Jacobite. “Is not the
      Tory party,” Waldershare would exclaim, “a succession of heroic spirits, ‘beautiful and
      swift,’ ever in the van, and foremost of their age?—Hobbes and Bolingbroke, Hume and Adam
      Smith, Wyndham and Cobham, Pitt and Grenville, Canning and Huskisson?—Are not the principles
      of Toryism those popular rights which men like Shippen and Hynde Cotton flung in the face of
      an alien monarch and his mushroom aristocracy?—Place bills, triennial bills, opposition to
      standing armies, to peerage bills?—Are not the traditions of the Tory party the noblest
      pedigree in the world? Are not its illustrations that glorious martyrology, that opens with
      the name of Falkland and closes with the name of Canning?”</p>
     <p>“I believe it is all true,” whispered Lord Beaumaris to Sylvia, who had really never heard
      of any of these gentlemen before, but looked most sweet and sympathetic.</p>
     <p>“He is a wonderful man—Mr. Waldershare,” said Mr. Vigo to Rodney, “but I fear not
      practical.”</p>
     <p>One day, not very long after his return from his travels, Waldershare went to breakfast with
      his uncle, Mr. Sidney Wilton, now a cabinet minister, still unmarried, and living in Grosvenor
      Square. Notwithstanding the difference of their politics, an affectionate intimacy subsisted
      between them; indeed Waldershare was a favourite of his uncle, who enjoyed the freshness of
      his mind, and quite appreciated his brilliancy of thought and speech, his quaint reading and
      effervescent imagination.</p>
     <p>“And so you think we are in for life, George,” said Mr. Wilson, taking a piece of toast. “I
      do not.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I go upon this,” said Waldershare. “It is quite clear that Peel has nothing to offer
      the country, and the country will not rally round a negation. When he failed in ‘34 they said
      there had not been sufficient time for the reaction to work. Well, now, since then, it has had
      nearly three years, during which you fellows have done everything to outrage every prejudice
      of the constituency, and yet they have given you a majority.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, that is all very well,” replied Mr. Wilton, “but we are the Liberal shop, and we have
      no Liberal goods on hand; we are the party of movement, and must perforce stand still. The
      fact is, all the great questions are settled. No one will burn his fingers with the Irish
      Church again, in this generation certainly not, probably in no other; you could not get ten
      men together in any part of the country to consider the corn laws; I must confess I regret it.
      I still retain my opinion that a moderate fixed duty would be a wise arrangement, but I quite
      despair in my time of any such advance of opinion; as for the ballot, it is hardly tolerated
      in debating societies. The present government, my dear George, will expire from inanition. I
      always told the cabinet they were going on too fast. They should have kept back municipal
      reform. It would have carried us on for five years. It was our only <hi>piece de
       resistance</hi>.”</p>
     <p>“I look upon the House of Commons as a mere vestry,” said Waldershare. “I believe it to be
      completely used up. Reform has dished it. There are no men, and naturally, because the
      constituencies elect themselves, and the constituencies are the most mediocre of the nation.
      The House of Commons now is like a spendthrift living on his capital. The business is done and
      the speeches are made by men formed in the old school. The influence of the House of Commons
      is mainly kept up by old social traditions. I believe if the eldest sons of peers now members
      would all accept the Chiltern hundreds, and the House thus cease to be fashionable, before a
      year was past, it would be as odious and as contemptible as the Rump Parliament.”</p>
     <p>“Well, you are now the eldest son of a peer,” said Sidney Wilton, smiling. “Why do you not
      set an example, instead of spending your father’s substance and your own in fighting a corrupt
      borough?”</p>
     <p>“I am <hi>vox clamantis</hi>,” said Waldershare. “I do not despair of its being done. But
      what I want is some big guns to do it. Let the eldest son of a Tory duke and the eldest son of
      a Whig duke do the same thing on the same day, and give the reason why. If Saxmundham, for
      example, and Harlaxton would do it, the game would be up.”</p>
     <p>“On the contrary,” said Mr. Wilton, “Saxmundham, I can tell you, will be the new cabinet
      minister.”</p>
     <p>“Degenerate land!” exclaimed Waldershare. “Ah! in the eighteenth century there was always a
      cause to sustain the political genius of the country,—the cause of the rightful dynasty.”</p>
     <p>“Well, thank God, we have got rid of all those troubles,” said Mr. Wilton.</p>
     <p>“Rid of them! I do not know that. I saw a great deal of the Duke of Modena this year, and
      tried as well as I could to open his mind to the situation.”</p>
     <p>“You traitor!” exclaimed Mr. Wilton. “If I were Secretary of State, I would order the butler
      to arrest you immediately, and send you to the Tower in a hack cab; but as I am only a
      President of a Board and your uncle, you will escape.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I should think all sensible men,” said Waldershare, “of all parties will agree, that
      before we try a republic, it would be better to give a chance to the rightful heir.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am not a republican,” said Mr. Wilton, “and I think Queen Victoria, particularly if
      she make a wise and happy marriage, need not much fear the Duke of Modena.”</p>
     <p>“He is our sovereign lord, all the same,” said Waldershare. “I wish he were more aware of it
      himself. Instead of looking to a restoration to his throne, I found him always harping on the
      fear of French invasion. I could not make him understand that France was his natural ally, and
      that without her help, Charlie was not likely to have his own again.”</p>
     <p>“Well, as you admire pretenders, George, I wish you were in my shoes this morning, for I
      have got one of the most disagreeable interviews on hand which ever fell to my lot.”</p>
     <p>“How so, my dear uncle?” said Waldershare, in a tone of sympathy, for he saw that the
      countenance of Mr. Wilton was disturbed.</p>
     <p>“My unhappy ward,” said Mr. Wilton; “you know, of course, something about him.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I was at school and college,” said Waldershare, “when it all happened. But I have
      just heard that you had relations with him.”</p>
     <p>“The most intimate; and there is the bitterness. There existed between his mother Queen
      Agrippina and myself ties of entire friendship. In her last years and in her greatest
      adversity she appealed to me to be the guardian of her son. He inherited all her beauty and
      apparently all her sweetness of disposition. I took the greatest pains with him. He was at
      Eton, and did well there. He was very popular; I never was so deceived in a boy in my life. I
      though him the most docile of human beings, and that I had gained over him an entire
      influence. I am sure it would have been exercised for his benefit. In short, I may say it now,
      I looked upon him as a son, and he certainly would have been my heir; and yet all this time,
      from his seventeenth year, he was immersed in political intrigue, and carrying on plots
      against the sovereign of his country, even under my own roof.”</p>
     <p>“How very interesting!” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“It may be interesting to you; I know what it cost me. The greatest anxiety and sorrow, and
      even nearly compromised my honour. Had I not a large-hearted chief and a true man of the world
      to deal with, I must have retired from the government.”</p>
     <p>“How could he manage it?” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“You have no conception of the devices and resources of the secret societies of Europe,”
      said Mr. Wilton. “His drawing-master, his fencing-master, his dancing-master, all his
      professors of languages, who delighted me by their testimony to his accomplishments and their
      praises of his quickness and assiduity, were active confederates in bringing about events
      which might have occasioned an European war. He left me avowedly to pay a visit in the
      country, and I even received letters from him with the postmark of the neighbouring town;
      letters all prepared beforehand. My first authentic information as to his movements was to
      learn, that he had headed an invading force, landed on the shores which he claimed as his own,
      was defeated and a prisoner.”</p>
     <p>“I remember it,” said Waldershare. “I had just then gone up to St. John’s, and I remember
      reading it with the greatest excitement.”</p>
     <p>“All this was bad enough,” said Mr. Wilton, “but this is not my sorrow. I saved him from
      death, or at least a dreadful imprisonment. He was permitted to sail to America on his parole
      that he would never return to Europe, and I was required, and on his solemn appeal I
      consented, to give my personal engagement that the compact should be sacred. Before two years
      had elapsed, supported all this time, too, by my bounty, there was an attempt, almost
      successful, to assassinate the king, and my ward was discovered and seized in the capital.
      This time he was immured, and for life, in the strongest fortress of the country; but secret
      societies laugh at governments, and though he endured a considerable imprisonment, the world
      has recently been astounded by hearing that he had escaped. Yes; he is in London and has been
      here, though in studied obscurity, for some little time. He has never appealed to me until
      within these few days, and now only on the ground that there are some family affairs which
      cannot be arranged without my approval. I had great doubts whether I should receive him. I
      feel I ought not to have done so. But I hesitated, and I know not what may be the truth about
      women, but of this I am quite sure, the man who hesitates is lost.”</p>
     <p>“How I should like to present at the interview, my dear uncle!” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“And I should not be sorry to have a witness,” said Mr. Wilton, “but it is impossible. I am
      ashamed to say how unhinged I feel; no person, and no memories, ought to exercise such an
      influence over one. To tell you the truth, I encouraged your pleasant gossip at breakfast by
      way of distraction at this moment, and now”——</p>
     <p>At this moment, the groom of the chambers entered and announced “His royal highness, Prince
      Florestan.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilton, who was too agitated to speak, waved his hand to Waldershare to retire, and his
      nephew vanished. As Waldershare was descending the staircase, he drew back on a landing-place
      to permit the prince to advance undisturbed. The prince apparently did not observe him, but
      when Waldershare caught the countenance of the visitor, he started.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLI</head>
     <p>“I know, sir, you are prejudiced against me,” said Prince Florestan, bowing before Mr.
      Wilton with a sort of haughty humility, “and therefore I the more appreciate your
      condescension in receiving me.”</p>
     <p>“I have no wish to refer to the past,” said Mr. Wilton somewhat sternly. “You mentioned in
      your letter that my co-operation was necessary with reference to your private affairs, of
      which I once was a trustee, and under those circumstances I felt it my duty to accede to your
      request. I wish our communication to be limited to that business.”</p>
     <p>“It shall be so strictly,” said the prince; “you may remember, sir, that at the unhappy
      period when we were deprived of our throne, the name of Queen Agrippina was inscribed on the
      great book of the state for a considerable sum, for which the credit of the state was pledged
      to her. It was strictly her private property, and had mainly accrued through the sale of the
      estates of her ancestors. This sum was confiscated, and several other amounts, which belonged
      to members of our house and to our friends. It was an act of pure rapine, so gross, that as
      time revolved, and the sense of justice gradually returned to the hearts of men, restitution
      was made in every instance except my own, though I have reason to believe that individual
      claim was the strongest. My bankers, the house of Neuchatel, who have much interested
      themselves in this matter, and have considerable influence with the government that succeeded
      us, have brought things to this pass, that we have reason to believe our claim would be
      conceded, if some of the foreign governments, and especially the government of this country,
      would signify that the settlement would not be disagreeable to them.” And the prince ceased,
      and raising his eyes, which were downcast as he spoke, looked Mr. Wilton straight in the
      face.</p>
     <p>“Before such a proposal could even be considered by Her Majesty’s Government,” said Mr.
      Wilton with a reddening cheek, “the intimation must be made to them by authority. If the
      minister of your country has such an intimation to make to ours, he should address himself to
      the proper quarter, to Lord Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>“I understand,” said Prince Florestan; “but governments, like individuals, sometimes shrink
      from formality. The government of my country will act on the intimation, but they do not care
      to make it an affair of despatches.”</p>
     <p>“There is only one way of transacting business,” said Mr. Wilton frigidly, and as if, so far
      as he was concerned, the interview was ended.</p>
     <p>“I have been advised on high authority,” said Prince Florestan, speaking very slowly, “that
      if any member of the present cabinet will mention in conversation to the representative of my
      country here, that the act of justice would not be disagreeable to the British Government, the
      affair is finished.”</p>
     <p>“I doubt whether any one of my colleagues would be prepared to undertake a personal
      interference of that kind with a foreign government,” said Mr. Wilton stiffly. “For my own
      part, I have had quite enough of such interpositions never to venture on them again.”</p>
     <p>“The expression of feeling desired would involve no sort of engagement,” said the
      imperturbable prince.</p>
     <p>“That depends on the conscience of the individual who interferes. No man of honour would be
      justified in so interposing if he believed he was thus furnishing arms against the very
      government of which he solicited the favour.”</p>
     <p>“But why should he believe this?” asked the prince with great calmness.</p>
     <p>“I think upon reflection,” said Mr. Wilton, taking up at the same time an opened letter
      which was before him, as if he wished to resume the private business on which he had been
      previously engaged, “that your royal highness might find very adequate reasons for the
      belief.”</p>
     <p>“I would put this before you with great deference, sir,” said the prince. “Take my own case;
      is it not more likely that I should lead that life of refined retirement, which I really
      desire, were I in possession of the means to maintain such a position with becoming dignity,
      than if I were distressed, and harassed, and disgusted, every day, with sights and incidents
      which alike outrage my taste and self-respect? It is not prosperity, according to common
      belief, that makes conspirators.”</p>
     <p>“You <hi>were</hi> in a position, and a refined position,” rejoined Mr. Wilton sharply; “you
      had means adequate to all that a gentleman could desire, and might have been a person of great
      consideration, and you wantonly destroyed all this.”</p>
     <p>“It might be remembered that I was young.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, you were young, very young, and your folly was condoned. You might have begun life
      again, for to the world at least you were a man of honour. You had not deceived the world,
      whatever you might have done to others.”</p>
     <p>“If I presume to make another remark,” said the prince calmly, but pale, “it is only,
      believe me, sir, from the profound respect I feel for you. Do not misunderstand these
      feelings, sir. They are not unbecoming the past. Now that my mother has departed, there is no
      one to whom I am attached except yourself. I have no feeling whatever towards any other human
      being. All my thought and all my sentiment are engrossed by my country. But pardon me, dear
      sir, for so let me call you, if I venture to say that, in your decision on my conduct, you
      have never taken into consideration the position which I inherited.”</p>
     <p>“I do not follow you, sir.”</p>
     <p>“You never will remember that I am the child of destiny,” said Prince Florestan. “That
      destiny will again place me on the throne of my fathers. That is as certain as I am now
      speaking to you. But destiny for its fulfilment ordains action. Its decrees are inexorable,
      but they are obscure, and the being whose career it directs is as a man travelling in a dark
      night; he reaches his goal even without the aid of stars or moon.”</p>
     <p>“I really do not understand what destiny means,” said Mr. Wilton. “I understand what conduct
      means, and I recognise that it should be regulated by truth and honour. I think a man had
      better have nothing to do with destiny, particularly if it is to make him forfeit his
      parole.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! sir, I well know that on that head you entertain a great prejudice in my respect.
      Believe me it is not just. Even lawyers acknowledge that a contract which is impossible cannot
      be violated. My return from America was inevitable. The aspirations of a great people and of
      many communities required my presence in Europe. My return was the natural development of the
      inevitable principle of historical necessity.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that principle is not recognised by Her Majesty’s Ministers,” said Mr. Wilton, and
      both himself and the prince seemed to rise at the same time.</p>
     <p>“I thank you, sir, for this interview,” said his royal highness. “You will not help me, but
      what I require will happen by some other means. It is necessary, and therefore it will
      occur.”</p>
     <p>The prince remounted his horse, and rode off quickly till he reached the Strand, where
      obstacles to rapid progress commenced, and though impatient, it was some time before he
      reached Bishopsgate Street. He entered the spacious courtyard of a noble mansion, and, giving
      his horse to the groom, inquired for Mr. Neuchatel, to whom he was at once ushered,—seated in
      a fine apartment at a table covered with many papers.</p>
     <p>“Well, my prince,” said Mr. Neuchatel with a smiling eye, “what brings such a great man into
      the City to-day? Have you seen your great friend?” And then Prince Florestan gave Mr.
      Neuchatel a succinct but sufficient summary of his recent interview.</p>
     <p>“Ah!” said Mr. Neuchatel, “so it is, so it is; I dare say if you were received at St.
      James’, Mr. Sidney Wilton would not be so very particular; but we must take things as we find
      them. If our fine friends will not help us, you must try us poor business men in the City. We
      can manage things here sometimes which puzzle them at the West End. I saw you were disturbed
      when you came in. Put on a good countenance. Nobody should ever look anxious except those who
      have no anxiety. I dare say you would like to know how your account is. I will send for it. It
      is not so bad as you think. I put a thousand pounds to it in the hope that your fine friend
      would help us, but I shall not take it off again. My Louis is going to-night to Paris, and he
      shall call upon the ministers and see what can be done. In the meantime, good appetite, sir. I
      am going to luncheon, and there is a place for you. And I will show you my Gainsborough that I
      have just bought, from a family for whom it was painted. The face is divine, very like our
      Miss Ferrars. I am going to send the picture down to Hainault. I won’t tell you what I gave
      for it, because perhaps you would tell my wife and she would be very angry. She would want the
      money for an infant school. But I think she has schools enough. Now to lunch.”</p>
     <p>On the afternoon of this day there was a half-holiday at the office, and Endymion had
      engaged to accompany Waldershare on some expedition. They had been talking together in his
      room where Waldershare was finishing his careless toilette, which however was never finished,
      and they had just opened the house door and were sallying forth when Colonel Albert rode up.
      He gave a kind nod to Endymion, but did not speak, and the companions went on. “By the by,
      Ferrars,” said Waldershare, pressing his arm and bubbling with excitement, “I have found out
      who your colonel is. It is a wondrous tale, and I will tell it all to you as we go on.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLII</head>
     <p>Endymion had now passed three years of his life in London, and considering the hard
      circumstances under which he had commenced this career, he might on the whole look back to
      those years without dissatisfaction. Three years ago he was poor and friendless, utterly
      ignorant of the world, and with nothing to guide him but his own good sense. His slender
      salary had not yet been increased, but with the generosity and aid of his sister and the
      liberality of Mr. Vigo, he was easy in his circumstances. Through the Rodneys, he had become
      acquainted with a certain sort of miscellaneous life, a knowledge of which is highly valuable
      to a youth, but which is seldom attained without risk. Endymion, on the contrary, was always
      guarded from danger. Through his most unexpected connection with the Neuchatel family, he had
      seen something of life in circles of refinement and high consideration, and had even caught
      glimpses of that great world of which he read so much and heard people talk more, the world of
      the Lord Roehamptons and the Lady Montforts, and all those dazzling people whose sayings and
      doings form the taste, and supply the conversation, and leaven the existence of admiring or
      wondering millions.</p>
     <p>None of these incidents, however, had induced any change in the scheme of his existence.
      Endymion was still content with his cleanly and airy garret; still dined at Joe’s; was still
      sedulous at his office, and always popular with his fellow clerks. Seymour Hicks, indeed, who
      studied the “Morning Post” with intentness, had discovered the name of Endymion in the
      elaborate lists of attendants on Mrs. Neuchatel’s receptions, and had duly notified the
      important event to his colleagues; but Endymion was not severely bantered on the occasion,
      for, since the withdrawal of St. Barbe from the bureau, the stock of envy at Somerset House
      was sensibly diminished.</p>
     <p>His lodging at the Rodneys’, however, had brought Endymion something more valuable than an
      innocuous familiarity with their various and suggestive life. In the friendship of Waldershare
      he found a rich compensation for being withdrawn from his school and deprived of his
      university. The care of his father had made Endymion a good classical scholar, and he had
      realised a degree of culture which it delighted the brilliant and eccentric Waldershare to
      enrich and to complete. Waldershare guided his opinions, and directed his studies, and formed
      his taste. Alone at night in his garret, there was no solitude, for he had always some book or
      some periodical, English or foreign, with which Waldershare had supplied him, and which he
      assured Endymion it was absolutely necessary that he should read and master.</p>
     <p>Nor was his acquaintance with Baron Sergius less valuable, or less fruitful of results. He
      too became interested in Endymion, and poured forth to him, apparently without reserve, all
      the treasures of his vast experience of men and things, especially with reference to the
      conduct of external affairs. He initiated him in the cardinal principles of the policies of
      different nations; he revealed to him the real character of the chief actors in the scene.
      “The first requisite,” Baron Sergius would say, “in the successful conduct of public affairs
      is a personal acquaintance with the statesmen engaged. It is possible that events may not
      depend now, so much as they did a century ago, on individual feeling, but, even if prompted by
      general principles, their application and management are always coloured by the idiosyncrasy
      of the chief actors. The great advantage which your Lord Roehampton, for example, has over all
      his colleagues in <hi>la haute politique</hi>, is that he was one of your plenipotentiaries at
      the Congress of Vienna. There he learned to gauge the men who govern the world. Do you think a
      man like that, called upon to deal with a Metternich or a Pozzo, has no advantage over an
      individual who never leaves his chair in Downing Street except to kill grouse? Pah! Metternich
      and Pozzo know very well that Lord Roehampton knows them, and they set about affairs with him
      in a totally different spirit from that with which they circumvent some statesman who has
      issued from the barricades of Paris.”</p>
     <p>Nor must it be forgotten that his debating society and the acquaintance which he had formed
      there, were highly beneficial to Endymion. Under the roof of Mr. Bertie Tremaine he enjoyed
      the opportunity of forming an acquaintance with a large body of young men of breeding, of high
      education, and full of ambition, that was a substitute for the society, becoming his youth and
      station, which he had lost by not going to the university.</p>
     <p>With all these individuals, and with all their circles, Endymion was a favourite. No doubt
      his good looks, his mien—which was both cheerful and pensive—his graceful and quiet manners,
      all told in his favour, and gave him a good start, but further acquaintance always sustained
      the first impression. He was intelligent and well-informed, without any alarming originality,
      or too positive convictions. He listened not only with patience but with interest to all, and
      ever avoided controversy. Here are some of the elements of a man’s popularity.</p>
     <p>What was his intellectual reach, and what his real character, it was difficult at this time
      to decide. He was still very young, only on the verge of his twentieth year; and his character
      had no doubt been influenced, it might be suppressed, by the crushing misfortunes of his
      family. The influence of his sister was supreme over him. She had never reconciled herself to
      their fall. She had existed only on the solitary idea of regaining their position, and she had
      never omitted an occasion to impress upon him that he had a great mission, and that, aided by
      her devotion, he would fulfil it. What his own conviction on this subject was may be obscure.
      Perhaps he was organically of that cheerful and easy nature, which is content to enjoy the
      present, and not brood over the past. The future may throw light upon all these points; at
      present it may be admitted that the three years of seemingly bitter and mortifying adversity
      have not been altogether wanting in beneficial elements in the formation of his character and
      the fashioning of his future life.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLIII</head>
     <p>Lady Montfort heard with great satisfaction from Mr. Neuchatel that Lord Roehampton was
      going to pay a visit to Hainault at Easter, and that he had asked himself. She playfully
      congratulated Mrs. Neuchatel on the subject, and spoke as if the affair was almost concluded.
      That lady, however, received the intimation with a serious, not to say distressed countenance.
      She said that she should be grieved to lose Adriana under any circumstances; but if her
      marriage in time was a necessity, she trusted she might be united to some one who would not
      object to becoming a permanent inmate of their house. What she herself desired for her
      daughter was a union with some clergyman, and if possible, the rector of their own parish. But
      it was too charming a dream to realise. The rectory at Hainault was almost in the Park, and
      was the prettiest house in the world, with the most lovely garden. She herself much preferred
      it to the great mansion—and so on.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort stared at her with impatient astonishment, and then said, “Your daughter, Mrs.
      Neuchatel, ought to make an alliance which would place her at the head of society.”</p>
     <p>“What a fearful destiny,” said Mrs. Neuchatel, “for any one, but overwhelming for one who
      must feel the whole time that she occupies a position not acquired by her personal
      qualities!”</p>
     <p>“Adriana is pretty,” said Lady Montfort. “I think her more than pretty; she is highly
      accomplished and in every way pleasing. What can you mean, then, my dear madam, by supposing
      she would occupy a position not acquired by her personal qualities?”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Neuchatel sighed and shook her head, and then said, “We need not have any controversy
      on this subject. I have no reason to believe there is any foundation for my fears. We all like
      and admire Lord Roehampton. It is impossible not to admire and like him. So great a man, and
      yet so gentle and so kind, so unaffected—I would say, so unsophisticated; but he has never
      given the slightest intimation, either to me or her father, that he seriously admired Adriana,
      and I am sure if he had said anything to her she would have told us.”</p>
     <p>“He is always here,” said Lady Montfort, “and he is a man who used to go nowhere except for
      form. Besides, I know that he admires her, that he is in love with her, and I have not a doubt
      that he has invited himself to Hainault in order to declare his feelings to her.”</p>
     <p>“How very dreadful!” exclaimed Mrs. Neuchatel. “What are we to do?”</p>
     <p>“To do!” said Lady Montfort; “why, sympathise with his happiness, and complete it. You will
      have a son-in-law of whom you may well be proud, and Adriana a husband who, thoroughly knowing
      the world, and women, and himself, will be devoted to her; will be a guide and friend, a guide
      that will never lecture, and a friend who will always charm, for there is no companion in the
      world like him, and I think I ought to know,” added Lady Montfort, “for I always tell him that
      I was the last of his conquests, and I shall ever be grateful to him for his having spared to
      me so much of his society.”</p>
     <p>“Adriana on this matter will decide for herself,” said Mrs. Neuchatel, in a serious tone,
      and with a certain degree of dignity. “Neither Mr. Neuchatel, nor myself, have ever attempted
      to control her feelings in this respect.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am now about to see Adriana,” said Lady Montfort; “I know she is at home. If I had
      not been obliged to go to Princedown, I would have asked you to let me pass Easter at Hainault
      myself.”</p>
     <p>On this very afternoon, when Myra, who had been walking in Regent’s Park with her brother,
      returned home, she found Adriana agitated, and really in tears.</p>
     <p>“What is all this, dearest?” inquired her friend.</p>
     <p>“I am too unhappy,” sobbed Adriana, and then she told Myra that she had had a visit from
      Lady Montfort, and all that had occurred in it. Lady Montfort had absolutely congratulated her
      on her approaching alliance with Lord Roehampton, and when she altogether disclaimed it, and
      expressed her complete astonishment at the supposition, Lady Montfort had told her she was not
      justified in giving Lord Roehampton so much encouragement and trifling with a man of his high
      character and position.</p>
     <p>“Fancy my giving encouragement to Lord Roehampton!” exclaimed Adriana, and she threw her
      arms round the neck of the friend who was to console her.</p>
     <p>“I agree with Lady Montfort,” said Myra, releasing herself with gentleness from her
      distressed friend. “It may have been unconsciously on your part, but I think you have
      encouraged Lord Roehampton. He is constantly conversing with you, and he is always here, where
      he never was before, and, as Lady Montfort says, why should he have asked himself to pass the
      Easter at Hainault if it were not for your society?”</p>
     <p>“He invited himself to Hainault, because he is so fond of papa,” said Adriana.</p>
     <p>“So much the better, if he is to be your husband. That will be an additional element of
      domestic happiness.”</p>
     <p>“O Myra! that you should say such things!” exclaimed Adriana.</p>
     <p>“What things?”</p>
     <p>“That I should marry Lord Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>“I never said anything of the kind. Whom you should marry is a question you must decide for
      yourself. All that I said was, that if you marry Lord Roehampton, it is fortunate he is so
      much liked by Mr. Neuchatel.”</p>
     <p>“I shall not marry Lord Roehampton,” said Adriana with some determination, “and if he has
      condescended to think of marrying me,” she continued, “as Lady Montfort says, I think his
      motives are so obvious that if I felt for him any preference it would be immediately
      extinguished.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! now you are going to ride your hobby, my dear Adriana. On that subject we never can
      agree; were I an heiress, I should have as little objection to be married for my fortune as my
      face. Husbands, as I have heard, do not care for the latter too long. Have more confidence in
      yourself, Adriana. If Lord Roehampton wishes to marry you, it is that he is pleased with you
      personally, that he appreciates your intelligence, your culture, your accomplishments, your
      sweet disposition, and your gentle nature. If in addition to these gifts you have wealth, and
      even great wealth, Lord Roehampton will not despise it, will not—for I wish to put it
      frankly—be uninfluenced by the circumstances, for Lord Roehampton is a wise man; but he would
      not marry you if he did not believe that you would make for him a delightful companion in
      life, that you would adorn his circle and illustrate his name.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! I see you are all in the plot against me,” said Adriana. “I have no friend.”</p>
     <p>“My dear Adriana, I think you are unreasonable; I could say even unkind.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! pardon me, dear Myra,” said Adriana, “but I really am so very unhappy.”</p>
     <p>“About what? You are your own mistress in this matter. If you do not like to marry Lord
      Roehampton, nobody will attempt to control you. What does it signify what Lady Montfort says?
      or anybody else, except your own parents, who desire nothing but your happiness? I should
      never have mentioned Lord Roehampton to you had you not introduced the subject yourself. And
      all that I meant to say was, what I repeat, that your creed that no one can wish to marry you
      except for your wealth is a morbid conviction, and must lead to unhappiness; that I do not
      believe that Lord Roehampton is influenced in his overture, if he make one, by any unworthy
      motive, and that any woman whose heart is disengaged should not lightly repudiate such an
      advance from such a man, by which, at all events, she should feel honoured.”</p>
     <p>“But my heart is engaged,” said Adriana in an almost solemn tone.</p>
     <p>“Oh! that is quite a different thing!” said Myra, turning pale.</p>
     <p>“Yes!” said Adriana; “I am devoted to one whose name I cannot now mention, perhaps will
      never mention, but I am devoted to him. Yes!” she added with fire, “I am not altogether so
      weak a thing as the Lady Montforts and some other persons seem to think me—I can feel and
      decide for myself, and it shall never be said of me that I purchased love.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLIV</head>
     <p>There was to be no great party at Hainault; Lord Roehampton particularly wished that there
      should be no fine folks asked, and especially no ambassadors. All that he wanted was to enjoy
      the fresh air, and to ramble in the forest, of which he had heard so much, with the young
      ladies.</p>
     <p>“And, by the by, Miss Ferrars,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “we must let what we were talking about
      the other day drop. Adriana has been with me quite excited about something Lady Montfort said
      to her. I soothed her and assured her she should do exactly as she liked, and that neither I
      nor her mother had any other wishes on such a subject than her own. The fact is, I answered
      Lady Montfort originally only half in earnest. If the thing might have happened, I should have
      been content—but it really never rested on my mind, because such matters must always originate
      with my daughter. Unless they come from her, with me they are mere fancies. But now I want you
      to help me in another matter, if not more grave, more businesslike. My lord must be amused,
      although it is a family party. He likes his rubber; that we can manage. But there must be two
      or three persons that he is not accustomed to meet, and yet who will interest him. Now, do you
      know, Miss Ferrars, whom I think of asking?”</p>
     <p>“Not I, my dear sir.”</p>
     <p>“What do you think of the colonel?” said Mr. Neuchatel, looking in her face with a rather
      laughing eye.</p>
     <p>“Well, he is very agreeable,” said Myra, “and many would think interesting, and if Lord
      Roehampton does not know him, I think he would do very well.”</p>
     <p>“Well, but Lord Roehampton knows all about him,” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“Well, that is an advantage,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“I do not know,” said Mr. Neuchatel. “Life is a very curious thing, eh, Miss Ferrars? One
      cannot ask one person to meet another even in one’s own home, without going through a sum of
      moral arithmetic.”</p>
     <p>“Is it so?” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“Well, Miss Ferrars,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “I want your advice and I want your aid; but then
      it is a long story, at which I am rather a bad hand,” and Mr. Neuchatel hesitated. “You know,”
      he said, suddenly resuming, “you once asked me who Colonel Albert was.”</p>
     <p>“But I do not ask you now,” said Myra, “because I know.”</p>
     <p>“Hah, hah!” exclaimed Mr. Neuchatel, much surprised.</p>
     <p>“And what you want to know is,” continued Myra, “whether Lord Roehampton would have any
      objection to meet Prince Florestan?”</p>
     <p>“That is something; but that is comparatively easy. I think I can manage that. But when they
      meet—that is the point. But, in the first place, I should like very much to know how you
      became acquainted with the secret.”</p>
     <p>“In a very natural way; my brother was my information,” she replied.</p>
     <p>“Ah! now you see,” continued Mr. Neuchatel, with a serious air, “a word from Lord Roehampton
      in the proper quarter might be of vast importance to the prince. He has a large inheritance,
      and he has been kept out of it unjustly. Our house has done what we could for him, for his
      mother, Queen Agrippina, was very kind to my father, and the house of Neuchatel never forgets
      its friends. But we want something else, we want the British Government to intimate that they
      will not disapprove of the restitution of the private fortune of the prince. I have felt my
      way with the premier; he is not favourable; he is prejudiced against the prince; and so is the
      cabinet generally; and yet all difficulties would vanish at a word from Lord Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>“Well, this is a good opportunity for you to speak to him,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“Hem!” said Mr. Neuchatel, “I am not so sure about that. I like Lord Roehampton, and,
      between ourselves, I wish he were first minister. He understands the Continent, and would keep
      things quiet. But, do you know, Miss Ferrars, with all his playful, good-tempered manner, as
      if he could not say a cross word or do an unkind act, he is a very severe man in business.
      Speak to him on business, and he is completely changed. His brows knit, he penetrates you with
      the terrible scrutiny of that deep-set eye; he is more than stately, he is austere. I have
      been up to him with deputations—the Governor of the Bank, and all the first men in the City,
      half of them M.P.s, and they trembled before him like aspens. No, it will not do for me to
      speak to him, it will spoil his visit. I think the way will be this; if he has no objection to
      meet the prince, we must watch whether the prince makes a favourable impression on him, and if
      that is the case, and Lord Roehampton likes him, what we must do next is this—<hi>you</hi>
      must speak to Lord Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>“I!”</p>
     <p>“Yes, Miss Ferrars, you. Lord Roehampton likes ladies. He is never austere to them, even if
      he refuses their requests, and sometimes he grants them. I thought first of Mrs. Neuchatel
      speaking to him, but my wife will never interfere in anything in which money is concerned;
      then I thought Adriana might express a hope when they were walking in the garden, but now that
      is all over; and so you alone remain. I have great confidence in you,” added Mr. Neuchatel, “I
      think you would do it very well. Besides, my lord rather likes you, for I have observed him
      often go and sit by you at parties, at our house.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, he is very high-bred in that,” said Myra, gravely and rather sadly; “and the fact of
      my being a dependent, I have no doubt, influences him.”</p>
     <p>“We are all dependents in this house,” said Mr. Neuchatel with his sweetest smile; “and I
      depend upon Miss Ferrars.”</p>
     <p>Affairs on the whole went on in a promising manner. The weather was delightful, and Lord
      Roehampton came down to Hainault just in time for dinner, the day after their arrival, and in
      the highest spirits. He seemed to be enjoying a real holiday; body and mind were in a like
      state of expansion; he was enchanted with the domain; he was delighted with the mansion,
      everything pleased and gratified him, and he pleased and gratified everybody. The party
      consisted only of themselves, except one of the nephews, with whom indeed Lord Roehampton was
      already acquainted; a lively youth, a little on the turf, not too much, and this suited Lord
      Roehampton, who was a statesman of the old aristocratic school, still bred horses, and
      sometimes ran one, and in the midst of an European crisis could spare an hour to Newmarket.
      Perhaps it was his only affectation.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Neuchatel, by whom he was seated, had the happy gift of conversation; but the party was
      of that delightful dimension, that it permitted talk to be general. Myra sate next to Lord
      Roehampton, and he often addressed her. He was the soul of the feast, and yet it is difficult
      to describe his conversation; it was a medley of graceful whim, interspersed now and then with
      a very short anecdote of a very famous person, or some deeply interesting reminiscence of some
      critical event. Every now and then he appealed to Adriana, who sate opposite to him in the
      round table, and she trusted that her irrepressible smiles would not be interpreted into undue
      encouragement.</p>
     <p>Lord Roehampton had no objection to meet Prince Florestan, provided there were no other
      strangers, and the incognito was observed. He rather welcomed the proposal, observing he liked
      to know public men personally; so, you can judge of their calibre, which you never can do from
      books and newspapers, or the oral reports of their creatures or their enemies. And so on the
      next day Colonel Albert was expected.</p>
     <p>Lord Roehampton did not appear till luncheon; he had received so many boxes from Downing
      Street which required his attention. “Business will follow one,” he said; “yesterday I thought
      I had baffled it. I do not like what I shall do without my secretaries. I think I shall get
      you young ladies to assist me.”</p>
     <p>“You cannot have better secretaries,” said Mr. Neuchatel; “Miss Ferrars often helps me.”</p>
     <p>Then what was to be done after luncheon? Would he ride, or would he drive? And where should
      they drive and ride to? But Lord Roehampton did not much care to drive, and was tired of
      riding. He would rather walk and ramble about Hainault. He wanted to see the place, and the
      forest and the fern, and perhaps hear one of those nightingales that they had talked of in
      Portland Place. But Mrs. Neuchatel did not care to walk, and Mr. Neuchatel, though it was a
      holiday in the City, had a great many letters to write, and so somehow or other it ended in
      Lord Roehampton and the two young ladies walking out together, and remaining so long and so
      late, that Mrs. Neuchatel absolutely contemplated postponing the dinner hour.</p>
     <p>“We shall just be in time, dear Mrs. Neuchatel,” said Myra; “Lord Roehampton has gone up to
      his rooms. We have heard a nightingale, and Lord Roehampton insisted upon our sitting on the
      trunk of a tree till it ceased—and it never ceased.”</p>
     <p>Colonel Albert, who had arrived, was presented to Lord Roehampton before dinner. Lord
      Roehampton received him with stately courtesy. As Myra watched, not without interest, the
      proceeding, she could scarcely believe, as she marked the lofty grace and somewhat haughty
      mien of Lord Roehampton, that it could be the same being of frolic and fancy, and even tender
      sentiment, with whom she had been passing the preceding hours.</p>
     <p>Colonel Albert sate next to Myra at dinner, and Lord Roehampton between Mrs. Neuchatel and
      her daughter. His manner was different to-day, not less pleased and pleasing, but certainly
      more restrained. He encouraged Mrs. Neuchatel to occupy the chief part in conversation, and
      whispered to Adriana, who became somewhat uneasy; but the whispers mainly consisted of his
      delight in their morning adventures. When he remarked that it was one of the most agreeable
      days of his life, she became a little alarmed. Then he addressed Colonel Albert across the
      table, and said that he had heard from Mr. Neuchatel that the colonel had been in America, and
      asked some questions about public men, which brought him out. Colonel Albert answered with
      gentleness and modesty, never at any length, but in language which indicated, on all the
      matters referred to, thought and discrimination.</p>
     <p>“I suppose their society is like the best society in Manchester?” said Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“It varies in different cities,” said Colonel Albert. “In some there is considerable
      culture, and then refinement of life always follows.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, but whatever they may be, they will always be colonial. What is colonial necessarily
      lacks originality. A country that borrows its language, its laws, and its religion, cannot
      have its inventive powers much developed. They got civilised very soon, but their civilisation
      was second-hand.”</p>
     <p>“Perhaps their inventive powers may develop themselves in other ways,” said the prince. “A
      nation has a fixed quantity of invention, and it will make itself felt.”</p>
     <p>“At present,” said Lord Roehampton, “the Americans, I think, employ their invention in
      imaginary boundary lines. They are giving us plenty of trouble now about Maine.”</p>
     <p>After dinner they had some music; Lord Roehampton would not play whist. He insisted on
      comparing the voices of his companions with that of the nightingales of the morning. He talked
      a great deal to Adriana, and Colonel Albert, in the course of the evening much to Myra, and
      about her brother. Lord Roehampton more than once had wished to tell her, as he had already
      told Miss Neuchatel, how delightful had been their morning; but on every occasion he had found
      her engaged with the colonel.</p>
     <p>“I rather like your prince,” he had observed to Mr. Neuchatel, as they came from the
      dining-room. “He never speaks without thinking; very reserved, I apprehend. They say, an
      inveterate conspirator.”</p>
     <p>“He has had enough of that,” said Mr. Neuchatel. “I believe he wants to be quiet.”</p>
     <p>“That class of man is never quiet,” said Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“But what can he do?” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“What can he not do? Half Europe is in a state of chronic conspiracy.”</p>
     <p>“You must keep us right, my dear lord. So long as you are in Downing Street I shall sleep at
      nights.”</p>
     <p>“Miss Ferrars,” said Lord Roehampton abruptly to Mr. Neuchatel, “must have been the daughter
      of William Ferrars, one of my great friends in old days. I never knew it till to-day, and she
      did not tell me, but it flashed across me from something she said.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, she is his daughter, and is in mourning for him at this moment. She has had sorrows,”
      said Mr. Neuchatel. “I hope they have ceased. It was one of the happiest days of my life when
      she entered this family.”</p>
     <p>“Ah!” said Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>The next day, after they had examined the famous stud and stables, there was a riding party,
      and in the evening Colonel Albert offered to perform some American conjuring tricks, of which
      he had been speaking in the course of the day. This was a most wonderful performance, and
      surprised and highly amused everybody. Colonel Albert was the last person who they expected
      would achieve such marvels; he was so quiet, not to say grave. They could hardly credit that
      he was the same person as he poured floods of flowers over Myra from her own borrowed
      pocket-handkerchief, and without the slightest effort or embarrassment, robbed Lord Roehampton
      of his watch, and deposited it in Adriana’s bosom. It was evident that he was a complete
      master of slight-of-hand.</p>
     <p>“Characteristic!” murmured Lord Roehampton to himself.</p>
     <p>It was the day after this, that Myra being in the music room and alone, Lord Roehampton
      opened the door, looked in, and then said, “Where is Miss Neuchatel?”</p>
     <p>“I think she is on the terrace.”</p>
     <p>“Let us try to find her, and have one of our pleasant strolls. I sadly want one, for I have
      been working very hard all this morning, and half the night.”</p>
     <p>“I will be with you, Lord Roehampton, in a moment.”</p>
     <p>“Do not let us have anybody else,” he said, as she left the room.</p>
     <p>They were soon on the terrace, but Adriana was not there.</p>
     <p>“We must find her,” said Lord Roehampton; “you know her haunts. Ah! what a delight it is to
      be in this air and this scene after those dreadful boxes! I wish they would turn us out. I
      think they must soon.”</p>
     <p>“Now for the first time,” said Myra, “Lord Roehampton is not sincere.”</p>
     <p>“Then you think me always sincere?” he replied.</p>
     <p>“I have no reason to think you otherwise.”</p>
     <p>“That is very true,” said Lord Roehampton, “truer perhaps than you imagine.” Then rather
      abruptly he said, “You know Colonel Albert very well?”</p>
     <p>“Pretty well. I have seen him here frequently, and he is also a friend of my brother.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! a friend of your brother.” Then, after a slight pause, he said, “He is an interesting
      man.”</p>
     <p>“I think so,” said Myra. “You know all about him, of course.”</p>
     <p>“Very good-looking.”</p>
     <p>“Well, he looks unhappy, I think, and worn.”</p>
     <p>“One is never worn when one is young,” said Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“He must have great anxieties and great sorrows,” said Myra. “I cannot imagine a position
      more unfortunate than that of an exiled prince.”</p>
     <p>“I can,” said Lord Roehampton. “To have the feelings of youth and the frame of age.”</p>
     <p>Myra was silent, one might say dumbfounded. She had just screwed herself up to the task
      which Mr. Neuchatel had imposed on her, and was about to appeal to the good offices of Lord
      Roehampton in favour of the prince, when he had indulged in a remark which was not only
      somewhat strange, but from the manner in which it was introduced hardly harmonised with her
      purpose.</p>
     <p>“Yes, I would give up everything,” said Lord Roehampton. “I would even be an exile to be
      young; to hear that Miss Ferrars deems me interesting and good-looking, though worn.”</p>
     <p>“What is going to happen?” thought Myra. “Will the earth open to receive me?”</p>
     <p>“You are silent,” said Lord Roehampton. “You will not speak, you will not sigh, you will not
      give a glance of consolation or even pity. But I have spoken too much not to say more.
      Beautiful, fascinating being, let me at least tell you of my love.”</p>
     <p>Myra could not speak, but put her left hand to her face. Gently taking her other hand, Lord
      Roehampton pressed it to his lips. “From the first moment I met you, my heart was yours. It
      was love at first sight; indeed I believe in no other. I was amused with the projects of my
      friend, and I availed myself of them, but not unfairly. No one can accuse me of trifling with
      the affections of your sweet companion, and I must do her the justice to say that she did
      everything to convince me that she shrank from my attentions. But her society was an excuse to
      enjoy yours. I was an habitual visitor in town that I might cherish my love, and, dare I say
      it, I came down here to declare it. Do not despise it, dearest of women; it is not worthy of
      you, but it is not altogether undeserving. It is, as you kindly believed it,—it is
      sincere!”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLV</head>
     <p>On the following day, Mr. Neuchatel had good-naturedly invited Endymion down to Hainault,
      and when he arrived there, a servant informed him that Miss Ferrars wished to see him in her
      room.</p>
     <p>It was a long interview and an agitated one, and when she had told her tale, and her brother
      had embraced her, she sat for a time in silence, holding his hand, and intimating, that, for a
      while, she wished that neither of them should speak. Suddenly, she resumed, and said, “Now you
      know all, dear darling; it is so sudden, and so strange, that you must be almost as much
      astounded as gratified. What I have sighed for, and prayed for—what, in moments of
      inspiration, I have sometimes foreseen—has happened. Our degradation is over. I seem to
      breathe for the first time for many years. I see a career, ay, and a great one; and what is
      far more important, I see a career for you.”</p>
     <p>“At this moment, dear Myra, think only of yourself.”</p>
     <p>“You are myself,” she replied, rather quickly, “never more so than at this moment;” and then
      she said in a tone more subdued, and even tender, “Lord Roehampton has every quality and every
      accident of life that I delight in; he has intellect, eloquence, courage, great station and
      power; and, what I ought perhaps more to consider, though I do not, a sweet disposition and a
      tender heart. There is every reason why we should be happy—yes, very happy. I am sure I shall
      sympathise with him; perhaps, I may aid him; at least, he thinks so. He is the noblest of men.
      The world will talk of the disparity of our years; but Lord Roehampton says that he is really
      the younger of the two, and I think he is right. My pride, my intense pride, never permitted
      to me any levity of heart.”</p>
     <p>“And when is it to happen?” inquired Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Not immediately. I could not marry till a year had elapsed after our great sorrow; and it
      is more agreeable, even to him, that our union should be delayed till the session is over. He
      wants to leave England; go abroad; have a real holiday. He has always had a dream of
      travelling in Spain; well, we are to realise the dream. If we could get off at the end of
      July, we might go to Paris, and then to Madrid, and travel in Andalusia in the autumn, and
      then catch the packet at Gibraltar, and get home just in time for the November cabinets.”</p>
     <p>“Dear Myra! how wonderful it all seems!” involuntarily exclaimed Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Yes, but more wonderful things will happen. We have now got a lever to move the world.
      Understand, my dear Endymion, that nothing is to be announced at present. It will be known
      only to this family, and the Penruddocks. I am bound to tell them, even immediately; they are
      friends that never can be forgotten. I have always kept up my correspondence with Mrs.
      Penruddock. Besides, I shall tell her in confidence, and she is perfectly to be depended on. I
      am going to ask my lord to let Mr. Penruddock marry us.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! that will be capital,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“There is another person, by the by, who must know it, at least my lord says so,” said Myra,
      “and that is Lady Montfort; you have heard of that lady and her plans. Well, she must be
      told—at least, sooner or later. She will be annoyed, and she will hate me. I cannot help it;
      every one is hated by somebody.”</p>
     <p>During the three months that had to elapse before the happy day, several incidents occurred
      that ought to be noted. In the first place, Lady Montfort, though disappointed and very much
      astonished, bore the communication from Lord Roehampton more kindly than he had anticipated.
      Lord Roehampton made it by letter, and his letters to women were more happy even than his
      despatches to ministers, and they were unrivalled. He put the matter in the most skilful form.
      Myra had been born in a social position not inferior to his own, and was the daughter of one
      of his earliest political friends. He did not dilate too much on her charms and captivating
      qualities, but sufficiently for the dignity of her who was to become his wife. And then he
      confessed to Lady Montfort how completely his heart and happiness were set on Lady Roehampton
      being welcomed becomingly by his friends; he was well aware, that in these matters things did
      not always proceed as one could wish, but this was the moment, and this the occasion, to test
      a friend, and he believed he had the dearest, the most faithful, the most fascinating, and the
      most powerful in Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Well, we must put the best face upon it,” exclaimed that lady; “he was always romantic.
      But, as he says, or thinks, what is the use of friends if they do not help you in a
      scrape?”</p>
     <p>So Lady Montfort made the acquaintance of Myra, and welcomed her new acquaintance cordially.
      She was too fine a judge of beauty and deportment not to appreciate them, even when a little
      prejudice lurked behind. She was amused also, and a little gratified, by being in the secret;
      presented Myra with a rare jewel, and declared that she should attend the wedding; though when
      the day arrived, she was at Princedown, and could not, unfortunately, leave her lord.</p>
     <p>About the end of June, a rather remarkable paragraph appeared in the journal of society:</p>
     <p>“We understand that His Royal Highness Prince Florestan, who has been for some little time
      in this country, has taken the mansion in Carlton Gardens, recently occupied by the Marquis of
      Katterfelto. The mansion is undergoing very considerable repairs, but it is calculated that it
      will be completed in time for the reception of His Royal Highness by the end of the autumn;
      His Royal Highness has taken the extensive moors of Dinniewhiskie for the coming season.”</p>
     <p>In the earlier part of July, the approaching alliance of the Earl of Roehampton with Miss
      Ferrars, the only daughter of the late Right Honourable William Pitt Ferrars, of Hurstley
      Hall, in the county of Berks, was announced, and great was the sensation, and innumerable the
      presents instantly ordered.</p>
     <p>But on no one did the announcement produce a greater effect than on Zenobia; that the
      daughter of her dearest friend should make so interesting and so distinguished an alliance was
      naturally most gratifying to her. She wrote to Myra a most impassioned letter, as if they had
      only separated yesterday, and a still longer and more fervent one to Lord Roehampton; Zenobia
      and he had been close friends in other days, till he wickedly changed his politics, and was
      always in office and Zenobia always out. This was never to be forgiven. But the bright lady
      forgot all this now, and sent to Myra the most wondrous bracelet of precious stones, in which
      the word “Souvenir” was represented in brilliants, rubies, and emeralds.</p>
     <p>“For my part,” said Myra to Endymion, “my most difficult task are the bridesmaids. I am to
      have so many, and know so few. I feel like a recruiting sergeant. I began to Adriana, but my
      lord helps me very much out of his family, and says, when we have had a few family dinners,
      all will be right.”</p>
     <p>Endymion did not receive the banter he expected at the office. The event was too great for a
      jest. Seymour Hicks, with a serious countenance, said Ferrars might get anywhere now,—all the
      ministerial receptions of course. Jawett said there would be no ministerial receptions soon;
      they were degrading functions. Clear-headed Trenchard congratulated him quietly, and said, “I
      do not think you will stay much longer among us, but we shall always remember you with
      interest.”</p>
     <p>At last the great day arrived, and at St. George’s, Hanover Square, the Right Honourable the
      Earl of Roehampton, K.G., was united to Miss Ferrars. Mr. Penruddock joined their hands. His
      son Nigel had been invited to assist him, but did not appear, though Myra had written to him.
      The great world assembled in force, and Endymion observed Mr. and Mrs. Rodney and Imogene in
      the body of the church. After the ceremony there was an entertainment in Portland Place, and
      the world ate ortolans and examined the presents. These were remarkable for number and
      splendour. Myra could not conceal her astonishment at possessing so many friends; but it was
      the fashion for all Lord Roehampton’s acquaintance to make him offerings, and to solicit his
      permission to present gifts to his bride. Mr. Neuchatel placed on her brow a diamond tiara,
      and Mrs. Neuchatel encircled her neck with one of her diamond necklaces. “I should like to
      give the other one to Adriana,” she observed, “but Adriana says that nothing will ever induce
      her to wear jewels.” Prince Florestan presented Lady Roehampton with a vase which had belonged
      to his mother, and which had been painted by Boucher for Marie Antoinette. It was matchless,
      and almost unique.</p>
     <p>Not long after this, Lord Beaumaris, with many servants and many guns, took Waldershare and
      Endymion down with him to Scotland.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLVI</head>
     <p>The end of the season is a pang to society. More hopes have been baffled than realised.
      There is something melancholy in the last ball, though the music ever seems louder, and the
      lights more glaring than usual. Or it may be, the last entertainment is that hecatomb they
      call a wedding breakfast, which celebrates the triumph of a rival. That is pleasant. Society,
      to do it justice, struggles hard to revive in other scenes the excitement that has expired. It
      sails to Cowes, it scuds to bubbling waters in the pine forests of the continent, it stalks
      even into Scotland; but it is difficult to restore the romance that has been rudely disturbed,
      and to gather again together the threads of the intrigue that have been lost in the wild
      flight of society from that metropolis, which is now described as “a perfect desert”—that is
      to say, a park or so, two or three squares, and a dozen streets where society lives; where it
      dines, and dances, and blackballs, and bets, and spouts.</p>
     <p>But to the world in general, the mighty million, to the professional classes, to all men of
      business whatever, the end of the season is the beginning of carnival. It is the fulfilment of
      the dream over which they have been brooding for ten months, which has sustained them in toil,
      lightened anxiety, and softened even loss. It is air, it is health, it is movement, it is
      liberty, it is nature—earth, sea, lake, moor, forest, mountain, and river. From the heights of
      the Engadine to Margate Pier, there is equal rapture, for there is an equal cessation of
      routine.</p>
     <p>Few enjoy a holiday more than a young clerk in a public office, who has been bred in a
      gentle home, and enjoyed in his boyhood all the pastimes of gentlemen. Now he is ever toiling,
      with an uncertain prospect of annual relaxation, and living hardly. Once on a time, at the
      paternal hall, he could shoot, or fish, or ride, every day of his life, as a matter of course;
      and now, what would he not give for a good day’s sport? Such thoughts had frequently crossed
      the mind of Endymion when drudging in London during the autumn, and when all his few
      acquaintances were away. It was, therefore, with no ordinary zest that he looked forward to
      the unexpected enjoyment of an unstinted share of some of the best shooting in the United
      Kingdom. And the relaxation and the pastime came just at the right moment, when the reaction,
      from all the excitement attendant on the marvellous change in his sister’s position, would
      have made him, deprived of her consoling society, doubly sensible of his isolated
      position.</p>
     <p>It so happened that the moors of Lord Beaumaris were contiguous to the celebrated shootings
      of Dinniewhiskie, which were rented by Prince Florestan, and the opportunity now offered which
      Waldershare desired of making the acquaintance of the prince in an easy manner. Endymion
      managed this cleverly. Waldershare took a great fancy to the prince. He sympathised with him,
      and imparted to Endymion his belief that they could not do a better thing than devote their
      energies to a restoration of his rights. Lord Beaumaris, who hated foreigners, but who was
      always influenced by Waldershare, also liked the prince, and was glad to be reminded by his
      mentor that Florestan was half an Englishman, not to say a whole one, for he was an Eton boy.
      What was equally influential with Lord Beaumaris was, that the prince was a fine shot, and
      indeed a consummate sportsman, and had in his manners that calm which is rather unusual with
      foreigners, and which is always pleasing to an English aristocrat. So in time they became
      intimate, sported much together, and visited each other at their respective quarters. The
      prince was never alone. What the county paper described as distinguished foreigners were
      perpetually paying him visits, long or short, and it did not generally appear that these
      visits were influenced by a love of sport. One individual, who arrived shortly after the
      prince, remained, and, as was soon known, was to remain permanently. This was a young
      gentleman, short and swarthy, with flashing eyes and a black moustache, known by the name of
      the Duke of St. Angelo, but who was really only a cadet of that illustrious house. The Duke of
      St. Angelo took the management of the household of the prince—was evidently the controller;
      servants trembled at his nod, and he rode any horse he liked; he invited guests, and arranged
      the etiquette of the interior. He said one day very coolly to Waldershare: “I observe that
      Lord Beaumaris and his friends never rise when the prince moves.”</p>
     <p>“Why should we?”</p>
     <p>“His rank is recognised and guaranteed by the Treaty of Vienna,” said the Duke of St.
      Angelo, with an arrogant air.</p>
     <p>“His princely rank,” replied Waldershare, “but not his royalty.”</p>
     <p>“That is a mere refinement,” said the duke contemptuously.</p>
     <p>“On the contrary, a clear distinction, and specifically made in the treaty. I do not think
      the prince himself would desire such a ceremony, and let me recommend you, duke,” added
      Waldershare, “not to go out of your way to insist on these points. They will not increase the
      prince’s popularity.”</p>
     <p>“The time will come, and before long, when the Treaty of Vienna, with its clear
      distinctions, will be at the bottom of the Red Sea,” said the Duke of St. Angelo, “and then no
      one will sit when His Majesty rises.”</p>
     <p>“Amen!” said Waldershare. “All diplomacy since the Treaty of Utrecht seems to me to be
      fiddle-faddle, and the country rewarded the great man who made that treaty by an
      attainder.”</p>
     <p>Endymion returned to town towards the end of September, Waldershare went to Paris, and Lord
      Beaumaris and the prince, who had become intimate, repaired together to Conington, the seat of
      Lord Beaumaris, to kill pheasants. Even the Rodneys, who had gone to the Rhine this year, had
      not returned. Endymion had only the society of his fellow clerks. He liked Trenchard, who was
      acute, full of official information, and of gentle breeding. Still it must be confessed that
      Endymion felt the change in his society. Seymour Hicks was hardly a fit successor to
      Waldershare, and Jawett’s rabid abstractions on government were certainly not so interesting
      as <hi>la haute politique</hi> of the Duke of St. Angelo. Were it not for the letters which he
      constantly received from his sister, he would have felt a little despondent. As it was, he
      renewed his studies in his pleasant garret, trained himself in French and German, and got up
      several questions for the Union.</p>
     <p>The month seemed very long, but it was not unprofitably spent. The Rodneys were still
      absent. They had not returned as they had intended direct to England, but had gone to Paris to
      meet Mr. Waldershare.</p>
     <p>At the end of October there was a semi-official paragraph announcing the approaching meeting
      of the Cabinet, and the movements of its members. Some were in the north, and some were in the
      south; some were killing the last grouse, and some, placed in green ridings, were blazing in
      battues. But all were to be at their post in ten days, and there was a special notification
      that intelligence had been received of the arrival of Lord and Lady Roehampton at
      Gibraltar.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLVII</head>
     <p>Lady Roehampton, in her stately mansion in St. James’ Square, found life very different from
      what she had experienced in her Andalusian dream. For three months she had been the constant
      companion of one of the most fascinating of men, whose only object had been to charm and
      delight her. And in this he had entirely succeeded. From the moment they arrived in London,
      however, they seemed to be separated, and although when they met, there was ever a sweet smile
      and a kind and playful word for her, his brow, if not oppressed with care, was always weighty
      with thought. Lord Roehampton was little at his office; he worked in a spacious chamber on the
      ground floor of his private residence, and which was called the Library, though its literature
      consisted only of Hansard, volumes of state papers, shelves of treatises, and interminable
      folios of parliamentary reports. He had not been at home a week before the floor of the
      apartment was literally covered with red boxes, all containing documents requiring attention,
      and which messengers were perpetually bringing or carrying away. Then there were long meetings
      of the Cabinet almost daily, and daily visits from ambassadors and foreign ministers, which
      prevented the transaction of the current business, and rendered it necessary that Lord
      Roehampton should sit up late in his cabinet, and work sometimes nearly till the hours of
      dawn. There had been of course too some arrears of business, for secretaries of state cannot
      indulge with impunity in Andalusian dreams, but Lord Roehampton was well served. His
      under-secretaries of state were capable and experienced men, and their chief had not been
      altogether idle in his wanderings. He had visited Paris, and the capital of France in those
      days was the capital of diplomacy. The visit of Lord Roehampton had settled some questions
      which might have lingered for years, and had given him that opportunity of personal survey
      which to a statesman is invaluable.</p>
     <p>Although it was not the season, the great desert had, comparatively speaking, again become
      peopled. There were many persons in town, and they all called immediately on Lady Roehampton.
      The ministerial families and the diplomatic corps alone form a circle, but there is also a
      certain number of charming people who love London in November, and lead there a wondrous
      pleasant life of real amusement, until their feudal traditions and their domestic duties
      summon them back to their Christmas homes.</p>
     <p>Lord and Lady Roehampton gave constant dinners, and after they had tried two or three, he
      expressed his wish to his wife that she should hold a small reception after these dinners. He
      was a man of great tact, and he wished to launch his wife quietly and safely on the social
      ocean. “There is nothing like practising before Christmas, my love,” he would say; “you will
      get your hand in, and be able to hold regular receptions in the spring.” And he was quite
      right. The dinners became the mode, and the assemblies were eagerly appreciated. The Secretary
      of the Treasury whispered to an Under-Secretary of State,—“This marriage was a <hi>coup</hi>.
      We have got another house.”</p>
     <p>Myra had been a little anxious about the relations between Lord Roehampton and her brother.
      She felt, with a woman’s instinct, that her husband might not be overpleased by her devotion
      to Endymion, and she could not resist the conviction that the disparity of age which is easily
      forgotten in a wife, and especially in a wife who adores you, assumes a different, and
      somewhat distasteful character, when a great statesman is obliged to recognise it in the shape
      of a boyish brother-in-law. But all went right, for the sweetness of Lord Roehampton’s temper
      was inexhaustible. Endymion had paid several visits to St. James’ square before Myra could
      seize the opportunity, for which she was ever watching, to make her husband and her brother
      acquainted.</p>
     <p>“And so you are one of us,” said Lord Roehampton, with his sweetest smile and in his most
      musical tone, “and in office. We must try to give you a lift.” And then he asked Endymion who
      was his chief, and how he liked him, and then he said, “A good deal depends on a man’s chief.
      I was under your grandfather when I first entered parliament, and I never knew a pleasanter
      man to do business with. He never made difficulties; he always encouraged one. A younker likes
      that.”</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton was desirous of paying some attention to all those who had been kind to her
      brother; particularly Mr. Waldershare and Lord Beaumaris—and she wished to invite them to her
      house. “I am sure Waldershare would like to come,” said Endymion, “but Lord Beaumaris, I know,
      never goes anywhere, and I have myself heard him say he never would.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, my lord was telling me Lord Beaumaris was quite <hi>farouche</hi>, and it is feared
      that we may lose him. That would be sad,” said Myra, “for he is powerful.”</p>
     <p>“I should like very much if you could give me a card for Mr. Trenchard,” said Endymion; “he
      is not in society, but he is quite a gentleman.”</p>
     <p>“You shall have it, my dear. I have always liked Mr. Trenchard, and I dare say, some day or
      other, he may be of use to you.”</p>
     <p>The Neuchatels were not in town, but Myra saw them frequently, and Mr. Neuchatel often dined
      in St. James’ Square—but the ladies always declined every invitation of the kind. They came up
      from Hainault to see Myra, but looked as if nothing but their great affection would prompt
      such a sacrifice, and seemed always pining for Arcadia. Endymion, however, not unfrequently
      continued his Sunday visits to Hainault, to which Mr. Neuchatel had given him a general
      welcome. This young gentleman, indeed, soon experienced a considerable change in his social
      position. Invitations flocked to him, and often from persons whom he did not know, and who did
      not even know him. He went by the name of Lady Roehampton’s brother, and that was a sufficient
      passport.</p>
     <p>“We are trying to get up a carpet dance to-night,” said Belinda to a fair friend. “What men
      are in town?”</p>
     <p>“Well, there is Mr. Waldershare, who has just left me.”</p>
     <p>“I have asked him.</p>
     <p>“Then there is Lord Willesden and Henry Grantley—I know they are passing through town—and
      there is the new man, Lady Roehampton’s brother.”</p>
     <p>“I will send to Lord Willesden and Henry Grantley immediately, and perhaps you will send a
      card, which I will write here, for me to the new man.”</p>
     <p>And in this way Mr. Ferrars soon found that he was what is called “everywhere.”</p>
     <p>One of the most interesting acquaintances that Lady Roehampton made was a colleague of her
      husband, and that was Mr. Sidney Wilton, once the intimate friend of her father. He had known
      herself and her brother when they were children, indeed from the cradle. Mr. Sidney Wilton was
      in the perfection of middle life, and looked young for his years. He was tall and pensive, and
      naturally sentimental, though a long political career, for he had entered the House of Commons
      for the family borough the instant he was of age, had brought to this susceptibility a
      salutary hardness. Although somewhat alienated from the friend of his youth by the course of
      affairs, for Mr. Sidney Wilton had followed Lord Roehampton, while Mr. Ferrars had adhered to
      the Duke of Wellington, he had not neglected Ferrars in his fall, but his offers of
      assistance, frankly and generously made, had been coldly though courteously rejected, and no
      encouragement had been given to the maintenance of their once intimate acquaintance.</p>
     <p>Mr. Sidney Wilton was much struck by the appearance of Lady Roehampton. He tried to compare
      the fulfilment of her promise with the beautiful and haughty child whom he used to wonder her
      parents so extravagantly spoiled. Her stature was above the average height of women and finely
      developed and proportioned. But it was in the countenance—in the pellucid and commanding brow,
      the deep splendour of her dark blue eyes softened by long lashes, her short upper lip, and the
      rich profusion of her dark chestnut hair—that his roused memory recalled the past; and he fell
      into a mood of agitated contemplation.</p>
     <p>The opportunities which he enjoyed of cultivating her society were numerous, and Mr. Wilton
      missed none. He was frequently her guest, and being himself the master of a splendid
      establishment, he could offer her a hospitality which every one appreciated. Lord Roehampton
      was peculiarly his political chief, and they had always been socially intimate. As the trusted
      colleague of her husband—as one who had known her in her childhood, and as himself a man
      singularly qualified, by his agreeable conversation and tender and deferential manner, to make
      his way with women—Mr. Sidney Wilton had no great difficulty, particularly in that happy
      demi-season which precedes Christmas, in establishing relations of confidence and intimacy
      with Lady Roehampton.</p>
     <p>The cabinets were over: the government had decided on their measures, and put them in a
      state of preparation, and they were about to disperse for a month. The seat of Lord Roehampton
      was in the extreme north of England, and a visit to it was inconvenient at this moment, and
      especially at this season. The department of Lord Roehampton was very active at this time, and
      he was unwilling that the first impression by his wife of her future home should be
      experienced at a season little favourable to the charms of a northern seat. Mr. Sidney Wilton
      was the proprietor of the most beautiful and the most celebrated villa in England; only twenty
      miles from town, seated on a wooded crest of the swan-crowned Thames, with gardens of delight,
      and woods full of pheasants, and a terrace that would have become a court, glancing over a
      wide expanse of bower and glade, studded with bright halls and delicate steeples, and the
      smoke of rural homes.</p>
     <p>It was arranged that Lord and Lady Roehampton should pass their Christmas at Gaydene with
      Mr. Sidney Wilton, stay as long as they liked, go where they chose, but make it their
      headquarters. It was a most successful visit; for a great deal of business was done, as well
      as pleasure enjoyed. The ambassadors, who were always a little uneasy at Christmas when
      everybody is away, and themselves without country homes, were all invited down for that week.
      Lord Roehampton used to give them audiences after the shooting parties. He thought it was a
      specific against their being too long. He used to say, “The first dinner-bell often brings
      things to a point.” After Christmas there was an ever-varying stream of company, chiefly
      official and parliamentary. The banquet and the battue did not always settle the business, the
      clause, or the schedule, which the guests often came down to Gaydene ostensibly to accomplish,
      but they sent men back to town with increased energy and good humour, and kept the party in
      heart. Towards the end of the month the premier came down, and for him the Blue Ribbon Covert
      had been reserved, though he really cared little for sport. It was an eighteenth century
      tradition that knights of the garter only had been permitted to shoot this choice preserve,
      but Mr. Sidney Wilton, in this advanced age, did not of course revive such an ultra-exclusive
      practice, and he was particular in arranging the party to include Mr. Jorrocks. This was a
      Radical member to whom considerable office had been given at the reconstruction of 1835, when
      it was necessary that the Whigs should conciliate the Mountain. He was a pretentious,
      underbred, half-educated man, fluent with all the commonplaces of middle-class ambition, which
      are humorously called democratic opinions, but at heart a sycophant of the aristocracy. He
      represented, however, a large and important constituency, and his promotion was at first
      looked upon as a masterpiece of management. The Mountain, who knew Jorrocks by heart, and felt
      that they had in their ranks men in every sense his superior, and that he could be no
      representative of their intelligence and opinions, and so by degrees prepare for their gradual
      admission to the sacred land, at first sulked over the promotion of their late companion, and
      only did not publicly deride it from the feeling that by so doing they might be playing the
      game of the ministry. At the time of which we are writing, having become extremely
      discontented and wishing to annoy the government, they even affected dissatisfaction at the
      subordinate position which Jorrocks occupied in the administration, and it was generally
      said—had become indeed the slang of the party—that the test of the sincerity of the ministry
      to Liberal principles was to put Jorrocks in the cabinet. The countenance of the premier when
      this choice programme was first communicated to him was what might have been expected had he
      learnt of the sudden descent upon this isle of an invading force, and the Secretary of the
      Treasury whispered in confidence to one or two leaders of the Mountain, “that if they did not
      take care they would upset the government.”</p>
     <p>“That is exactly what we want to do,” was the reply.</p>
     <p>So it will be seen that the position of the ministry, previous to the meeting of parliament
      in 1839, was somewhat critical. In the meantime, its various members, who knew their man,
      lavished every practicable social attention on Jorrocks. The dinners they gave him were
      doubled; they got their women to call on his women; and Sidney Wilton, a member of an
      illustrious garter family, capped the climax by appointing him one of the party to shoot the
      Blue Ribbon Covert.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilton had invited Endymion to Gaydene, and, as his stay there could only be brief, had
      even invited him to repeat the visit. He was, indeed, unaffectedly kind to one whom he
      remembered so young, and was evidently pleased with him.</p>
     <p>One evening, a day or two before the break-up of the party, while some charming Misses
      Playfellow, with an impudent brother, who all lived in the neighbourhood, were acting
      charades, Mr. Wilton said to Lady Roehampton, by whose side he was sitting in the circle—</p>
     <p>“I have had a very busy morning about my office. There is to be a complete revolution in it.
      The whole system is to be reconstructed; half the present people are to be pensioned off, and
      new blood is to be introduced. It struck me that this might be an opening for your brother. He
      is in the public service—that is something; and as there are to be so many new men, there will
      be no jealousy as to his promotion. If you will speak to him about it, and he likes it, I will
      appoint him one of the new clerks; and then, if he also likes it, he shall be my private
      secretary. That will give him position, and be no mean addition to his income, you know, if we
      last—but that depends, I suppose, on Mr. Jorrocks.”</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton communicated all this to her brother on her return to London. “It is exactly
      what I wished,” she said. “I wanted you to be private secretary to a cabinet minister, and if
      I were to choose any one, except, of course, my lord, it would be Mr. Wilton. He is a perfect
      gentleman, and was dear papa’s friend. I understand you will have three hundred a year to
      begin with, and the same amount as his secretary. You ought to be able to live with ease and
      propriety on six hundred a year—and this reminds me of what I have been thinking of before we
      went to Gaydene. I think now you ought to have a more becoming residence. The Rodneys are good
      people, I do not doubt, and I dare say we shall have an opportunity of proving our sense of
      their services; but they are not exactly the people that I care for you to live with, and, at
      any rate, you cannot reside any longer in a garret. I have taken some chambers in the Albany,
      therefore, for you, and they shall be my contribution to your housekeeping. They are not badly
      furnished, but they belonged to an old general officer, and are not very new-fashioned; but we
      will go together and see them to-morrow, and I dare say I shall soon be able to make them
       <hi>comme il faut</hi>.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLVIII</head>
     <p>This considerable rise in the life of Endymion, after the first excitement occasioned by its
      announcement to him had somewhat subsided, was not contemplated by him with unmixed feelings
      of satisfaction. It seemed to terminate many relations of life, the value of which he had
      always appreciated, but which now, with their impending conclusion, he felt, and felt keenly,
      had absolutely contributed to his happiness. There was no great pang in quitting his
      fellow-clerks, except Trenchard, whom he greatly esteemed. But poor little Warwick Street had
      been to him a real home, if unvarying kindness, and sedulous attention, and the affection of
      the eyes and heart, as well as of the mouth, can make a hearth. He hoped he might preserve the
      friendship of Waldershare, which their joint intimacy with the prince would favour; but still
      he could hardly flatter himself that the delightful familiarity of their past lives could
      subsist. Endymion sighed, and then he sighed again. He felt sad. Because he was leaving the
      humble harbour of refuge, the entrance to which, even in the darkest hour of his fallen
      fortunes, was thought somewhat of an indignity, and was about to assume a position which would
      not have altogether misbecome the earliest expectations of his life? That seems unreasonable;
      but mankind, fortunately, are not always governed by reason, but by sentiment, and often by
      very tender sentiment.</p>
     <p>When Endymion, sitting in his little room, analysed his feelings, he came to the conclusion
      that his sadness was occasioned by his having to part from Imogene. It often requires an event
      in life, and an unexpected one, to make us clearly aware of the existence of feelings which
      have long influenced us. Never having been in a position in which the possibility of uniting
      his fate to another could cross his mind for a moment, he had been content with the good
      fortune which permitted a large portion of his life to be passed in the society of a woman
      who, unconsciously both to him and to herself, had fascinated him. The graceful child who,
      four or five years ago, had first lit him to his garret, without losing any of her rare and
      simple ingenuousness, had developed into a beautiful and accomplished woman. There was a
      strong resemblance between Imogene and her sister, but Imogene was a brunette. Her countenance
      indicated far more intellect and character than that of Sylvia. Her brow was delicately
      pencilled and finely arched, and her large dark eyes gleamed with a softness and sweetness of
      expression, which were irresistibly attractive, and seemed to indicate sympathy with
      everything that was good and beautiful. Her features were not so regular as her sister’s; but
      when she smiled, her face was captivating.</p>
     <p>Endymion had often listened, half with fondness and half with scepticism, to Waldershare
      dilating, according to his wont, on the high character and qualities of Imogene, whom he
      persisted in believing he was preparing for a great career. “How it will come about I cannot
      say,” he would remark; “but it will come. If my legitimate sovereign were on the throne, and I
      in the possession of my estates, which were graciously presented by the usurper to the
      sausage-makers, or some other choice middle-class corporation, I would marry her myself. But
      that is impossible. That would only be asking her to share my ruin. I want her to live in
      palaces, and perhaps, in my decline of life, make me her librarian, like Casanova. I should be
      content to dine in her hall every day beneath the salt, and see her enter with her state, amid
      the flourish of trumpets.” And now, strange to say, Endymion was speculating on the fate of
      Imogene, and, as he thought, in a more practical spirit. Six hundred a year, he thought, was
      not a very large income; but it was an income, and one which a year ago he never contemplated
      possessing until getting grey in the public service. Why not realise perfect happiness at
      once? He could conceive no bliss greater than living with Imogene in one of those little
      villas, even if semi-detached, which now are numbered by tens of thousands, and which were
      then beginning to shoot out their suburban antennae in every direction of our huge metropolis.
      He saw her in his mind’s eye in a garden of perpetual sunshine, breathing of mignonette and
      bright with roses, and waiting for him as he came down from town and his daily labours, in the
      cheap and convenient omnibus. What a delightful companion to welcome him! How much to tell
      her, and how much to listen to! And then their evenings with a delicious book or some
      delightful music! What holidays, too, of romantic adventure! The vine-clad Rhine, perhaps
      Switzerland; at any rate, the quaint old cities of Flanders, and the winding valley of the
      Meuse. They could live extremely well on six hundred a year, yes, with all the real
      refinements of existence. And all their genuine happiness was to be sacrificed for utterly
      fantastic and imaginary gratifications, which, if analysed, would be found only to be efforts
      to amuse and astonish others.</p>
     <p>It did not yet occur to Endymion that his garden could not always be sunshiny; that cares
      crop up in villas, even semi-detached, as well as joys; that he would have children, and
      perhaps too many; that they would be sick, and that doctors’ bills would soon put a stop to
      romantic excursions; that his wife would become exhausted with nursing and clothing and
      teaching them; that she herself would become an invalid, and moped to death; that his
      resources would every day bear a less proportion to his expenditure; and that wanting money,
      he would return too often from town a harassed husband to a jaded wife!</p>
     <p>Mr. Rodney and Sylvia were at Conington on a visit to Lord Beaumaris, hunting. It was
      astonishing how Sylvia had ridden to the hounds, mounted on the choicest steeds, and in a
      scarlet habit which had been presented to her by Mr. Vigo. She had created quite an enthusiasm
      in the field, and Lord Beaumaris was proud of his guests. When Endymion parted with his sister
      at the Albany, where they had been examining his rooms, he had repaired to Warwick Street,
      with some expectation that the Rodneys would have returned from Conington, and he intended to
      break to his host the impending change in his life. The Rodneys, however, had not arrived, and
      so he ascended to his room, where he had been employed in arranging his books and papers, and
      indulging in the reverie which we have indicated. When he came downstairs, wishing to inquire
      about the probable arrival of his landlord, Endymion knocked at the door of the parlour where
      they used to assemble, and on entering, found Imogene writing.</p>
     <p>“How do you do, Mr. Ferrars?” she said, rising. “I am writing to Sylvia. They are not
      returning as soon as they intended, and I am to go down to Conington by an early train
      to-morrow.”</p>
     <p>“I want to see Mr. Rodney,” said Endymion moodily.</p>
     <p>“Can I write anything to him, or tell him anything?” said Imogene.</p>
     <p>“No,” continued Endymion in a melancholy tone. “I can tell you what I wanted to say. But you
      must be occupied now, going away, and unexpectedly, to-morrow. It seems to me that every one
      is going away.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we have lost the prince, certainly,” said Imogene, “and I doubt whether his rooms
      will be ever let again.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed!” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Well, I only know what Mr. Waldershare tells me. He says that Mr. Rodney and Mr. Vigo have
      made a great speculation, and gained a great deal of money; but Mr. Rodney never speaks to me
      of such matters, nor indeed does Sylvia. I am myself very sorry that the prince has gone, for
      he interested me much.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I should think Mr. Rodney would not be very sorry to get rid of me then,” said
      Endymion.</p>
     <p>“O Mr. Ferrars! why should you say or think such things! I am sure that my brother and
      sister, and indeed every one in this house, always consider your comfort and welfare before
      any other object.”</p>
     <p>“Yes,” said Endymion, “you have all been most kind to me, and that makes me more wretched at
      the prospect of leaving you.”</p>
     <p>“But there is no prospect of that?”</p>
     <p>“A certainty, Imogene; there is going to be a change in my life,” and then he told her
      all.</p>
     <p>“Well,” said Imogene, “it would be selfish not to be happy at what I hear; but though I hope
      I am happy, I need not be joyful. I never used to be nervous, but I am afraid I am getting so.
      All these great changes rather shake me. This adventure of the prince—as Mr. Waldershare says,
      it is history. Then Miss Myra’s great marriage, and your promotion—although they are exactly
      what we used to dream about, and wished a fairy would accomplish, and somehow felt that,
      somehow or other, they must happen—yet now they have occurred, one is almost as astounded as
      delighted. We certainly have been very happy in Warwick Street, at least I have been, all
      living as it were together. But where shall we be this time next year? All scattered, and
      perhaps not even the Rodneys under this roof. I know not how it is, but I dread leaving the
      roof where one has been happy.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! you know you must leave it one day or other, Imogene. You are sure to marry; that you
      cannot avoid.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am not by any means sure about that,” said Imogene. “Mr. Waldershare, in educating
      me, as he says, as a princess, has made me really neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, nor even that
      coarser but popular delicacy never forgotten. I could not unite my life with a being who was
      not refined in mind and in manners, and the men of my class in life, who are the only ones
      after all who might care to marry me, shock my taste, I am ashamed to say so. I am not sure it
      is not wicked to think it even; but so it is.”</p>
     <p>“Why do you not marry Waldershare?” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“That would be madness! I do not know any alliance that could prove more unfortunate. Mr.
      Waldershare must never marry. All people of imagination, they say, are difficult to live with;
      but a person who consists solely of imagination, like Mr. Waldershare, who has indeed no other
      attribute—before a year was past, married, he would fly to the desert or to La Trappe, commit
      terrible scandals from mere weariness of feeling, write pasquinades against the wife of his
      bosom, and hold us both up to the fierce laughter of the world. No, no; he is the best, the
      dearest, and the most romantic of friends; tender as a father, and sometimes as wise, for
      genius can be everything. He is going to rise early to-morrow, which he particularly dislikes,
      because he will not let me go to the station alone; though I tell him, as I often tell him,
      those are the becoming manners of my class.”</p>
     <p>“But you might meet a person of the refinement you require,” said Endymion, “with a moderate
      and yet a sufficient income, who would not be unworthy of you.”</p>
     <p>“I doubt it,” said Imogene.</p>
     <p>“But, do not doubt it, dear Imogene,” said Endymion, advancing; “such charms as yours, both
      of body and of mind, such a companion in life, so refined, so accomplished, and yet endowed
      with such clear sense, and such a sweet disposition—believe me”——</p>
     <p>But at this moment a splendid equipage drove up to the door, with powdered footmen and long
      canes behind, and then a terrible rap, like the tattoo of a field-marshal.</p>
     <p>“Good gracious! what is all this?” exclaimed Imogene.</p>
     <p>“It is my sister,” said Endymion, blushing; “it is Lady Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>“I must go to her myself,” said Imogene; “I cannot have the servant attend upon your
      sister.”</p>
     <p>Endymion remained silent and confused. Imogene was some little time at the carriage-door,
      for Lady Roehampton had inquiries to make after Sylvia and other courteous things to say, and
      then Imogene returned, and said to Endymion, “Lady Roehampton wishes you to go with her
      directly on some particular business.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XLIX</head>
     <p>Endymion liked his new official life very much. Whitehall was a great improvement on
      Somerset House, and he had sufficient experience of the civil service to duly appreciate the
      advantage of being permanently quartered in one of the chief departments of the state, instead
      of obscurely labouring in a subordinate office, with a limited future, and detached from all
      the keenly interesting details of public life. But it was not this permanent and substantial
      advantage which occasioned him such lively and such novel pleasure, as the fact of his being a
      private secretary, and a private secretary to a cabinet minister.</p>
     <p>The relations between a minister and his secretary are, or at least should be, among the
      finest that can subsist between two individuals. Except the married state, there is none in
      which so great a degree of confidence is involved, in which more forbearance ought to be
      exercised, or more sympathy ought to exist. There is usually in the relation an identity of
      interest, and that of the highest kind; and the perpetual difficulties, the alternations of
      triumph and defeat, develop devotion. A youthful secretary will naturally feel some degree of
      enthusiasm for his chief, and a wise minister will never stint his regard for one in whose
      intelligence and honour he finds he can place confidence.</p>
     <p>There never was a happier prospect of these relations being established on the most
      satisfactory basis than in the instance of Endymion and his new master. Mr. Sidney Wilton was
      a man of noble disposition, fine manners, considerable culture, and was generally gracious.
      But he was disposed to be more than gracious to Endymion, and when he found that our young
      friend had a capacity for work—that his perception was quick and clear—that he wrote with
      facility—never made difficulties—was calm, sedulous, and patient, the interest which Mr.
      Wilton took in him as the son of William Ferrars, and, we must add, as the brother of Lady
      Roehampton, became absorbed in the personal regard which the minister soon entertained for his
      secretary. Mr. Wilton found a pleasure in forming the mind of Endymion to the consideration
      and comprehension of public affairs; he spoke to him both of men and things without reserve;
      revealed to him the characters of leading personages on both sides, illustrated their
      antecedents, and threw light upon their future; taught him the real condition of parties in
      parliament, rarely to be found in newspapers; and finally, when he was sufficiently initiated,
      obtained for his secretary a key for his cabinet boxes, which left little of the business of
      government unknown to Endymion.</p>
     <p>Such great confidence, and that exhibited by one who possessed so many winning qualities,
      excited in the breast of Endymion the most lively feelings of gratitude and respect. He tried
      to prove them by the vigilant and unwearying labour with which he served his master, and he
      served him every day more effectually, because every day he became more intimate with the mind
      and method of Mr. Wilton. Every one to a certain degree is a mannerist; every one has his
      ways; and a secretary will be assisted in the transaction of business if a vigilant
      observation has made him acquainted with the idiosyncrasy of his chief.</p>
     <p>The regulations of the office which authorise a clerk, appointed to a private secretaryship,
      to deviate from the routine duties of the department, and devote his time entirely to the
      special requirements of his master, of course much assisted Endymion, and proved also a
      pleasant relief, for he had had enough at Somerset House of copying documents and drawing up
      formal reports. But it was not only at Whitehall that he saw Mr. Wilton, and experienced his
      kindness. Endymion was a frequent guest under Mr. Wilton’s roof, and Mr. Wilton’s
      establishment was one of the most distinguished in London. They met also much in the evenings,
      and always at Lady Roehampton’s, where Mr. Wilton was never absent. Whenever and wherever they
      met, even if they had been working together the whole morning, Mr. Wilton always greeted
      Endymion with the utmost consideration—because he knew such a recognition would raise Endymion
      in the eyes of the social herd, who always observe little things, and generally form from them
      their opinions of great affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER L</head>
     <p>Mr. Wilton was at Charing Cross, on his way to his office, when a lady saluted him from her
      carriage, which then drew up to the pavement and stopped.</p>
     <p>“We have just arrived,” said Lady Montfort, “and I want you to give me a little dinner
      to-day. My lord is going to dine with an Old Bailey lawyer, who amuses him, and I do not like
      to be left, the first day, on the <hi>pave</hi>.”</p>
     <p>“I can give you a rather large dinner, if you care to come,” said Mr. Wilton, “but I fear
      you will not like it. I have got some House of Commons men dining with me to-day, and one or
      two of the other House to meet them. My sister Georgina has very good-naturedly promised to
      come, with her husband, and I have just written a note to the Duchess Dowager of Keswick, who
      often helps me—but I fear this sort of thing would hardly suit you.”</p>
     <p>“On the contrary, I think it will be very amusing. Only do not put me between two of your
      colleagues. Anybody amuses me for once. A new acquaintance is like a new book. I prefer it,
      even if bad, to a classic.”</p>
     <p>The dinner party to-day at Mr. Wilton’s was miscellaneous, and not heterogeneous enough to
      produce constraint, only to produce a little excitement—some commoners high in office, and the
      Treasury whip, several manufacturers who stood together in the room, and some metropolitan
      members. Georgina’s husband, who was a lord-in-waiting, and a great swell, in a green riband,
      moved about with adroit condescension, and was bewitchingly affable. The manufacturing members
      whispered to each other that it was a wise thing to bring the two Houses together, but when
      Her Grace the Duchess Dowager of Keswick was announced, they exchanged glances of astounded
      satisfaction, and felt that the government, which had been thought to be in a somewhat rickety
      condition, would certainly stand.</p>
     <p>Berengaria came a little late, not very. She thought it had been earlier, but it was not.
      The duchess dowager opened her eyes with wonderment when she beheld Lady Montfort, but the
      company in general were not in the least aware of the vast social event that was occurring.
      They were gratified in seeing another fine lady, but did not, of course, rank her with a
      duchess.</p>
     <p>The dinner went off better than Mr. Wilton could have hoped, as it was impossible to place a
      stranger by Lady Montfort. He sate in the middle of his table with the duchess dowager on his
      right hand, and Berengaria, who was taken out by the green riband, on the other. As he knew
      the green riband would be soon exhausted, he devoted himself to Lady Montfort, and left the
      duchess to her own resources, which were considerable, and she was soon laying down her
      opinions on men and things to her other neighbours with much effect. The manufacturers talked
      shop to each other in whispers, that is to say, mixed House of Commons tattle about bills and
      committees with news from Manchester and Liverpool, and the West Riding. The metropolitan
      members, then a more cosmopolitan body and highly miscellaneous in their character and
      pursuits, were louder, and perhaps more easy, even ventured to talk across the table when near
      its end, and enticed the peers into discussions on foreign politics.</p>
     <p>Mr. Sidney Wilton having been delightful, thought it necessary to observe that he feared
      Lady Montfort had been bored. “I have been, and am, extremely amused,” she replied; “and now
      tell me, who is that young man at the very end of the table?”</p>
     <p>“That is my private secretary, Mr. Ferrars.”</p>
     <p>“Ferrars!”</p>
     <p>“A brother of Lady Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>“Present him to me after dinner.”</p>
     <p>Endymion knew Lady Montfort by sight, though she did not know him. He had seen her more than
      once at the receptions of Mrs. Neuchatel, where, as indeed in every place, she was the
      cynosure. He was much astonished at meeting her at this party to-day,—almost as surprised as
      the duchess dowager, for Endymion, who was of an observant nature, was beginning to comprehend
      society and all its numerous elements, and schools, and shades, and classes. When they entered
      the saloon, Mr. Wilton led Endymion up to Lady Montfort at once, and she immediately inquired
      after his sister. “Do you think,” she said, “Lady Roehampton would see me to-morrow if I
      called on her?”</p>
     <p>“If I were Lady Roehampton, I would,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort looked at him with a glance of curious scrutiny; not smiling, and yet not
      displeased. “I will write her a little note in the morning,” said Lady Montfort thoughtfully.
      “One may leave cards for ever. Mr. Wilton tells me you are quite his right hand.”</p>
     <p>“Mr. Wilton is too kind to me,” said Endymion. “One could not be excused for not doing one’s
      best for such a master.”</p>
     <p>“You like people to be kind to you?” said Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Well, I have not met with so much kindness in this world as to become insensible to
      it.”</p>
     <p>“You are too young to be melancholy,” said Lady Montfort; “are you older than Lady
      Roehampton?”</p>
     <p>“We are twins.”</p>
     <p>“Twins! and wonderfully like too! Is it not thought so?”</p>
     <p>“I have sometimes heard it mentioned.”</p>
     <p>“Oh, it is striking!” said Lady Montfort, and she motioned to him to sit down by her; and
      then she began to talk politics, and asked him what the members thought at dinner of the
      prospects of the government, and what he had heard of the malcontent movement that they said
      was <hi>in petto</hi>. Endymion replied that Mr. Sharpset, the Secretary of the Treasury, did
      not think much of it.</p>
     <p>“Well, I wish I did not,” said Lady Montfort. “However, I will soon find out something about
      it. I have only just come to town; but I intend to open my house, immediately. Now I must go.
      What are you going to do with yourself to-morrow? I wish you would come and dine with Lord
      Montfort. It will be quite without form, a few agreeable and amusing people; Lord Montfort
      must be amused. It seems a reasonable fancy, but very difficult to realise; and now you shall
      ask for my carriage, and to-morrow I hope to be able to tell Lady Roehampton what very great
      pleasure I have had in making the acquaintance of her brother.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LI</head>
     <p>The morning after, Endymion was emerging from the court-yard of the Albany, in order to call
      on Mr. Rodney, who, as he learnt from a casual remark in a letter from Waldershare, would be
      in town. The ladies were left behind for the last week of hunting, but business called Mr.
      Rodney home. Waldershare wrote to Endymion in the highest spirits, and more than once declared
      that he was the happiest of men. Just as Endymion had entered Piccadilly, he was stopped by a
      once familiar face; it was St. Barbe, who accosted him with great warmth, and as usual began
      to talk about himself. “You are surprised to see me,” he said. “It is two years since we met.
      Well, I have done wonders; carried all before me. By Jove, sir, I can walk into a minister’s
      private room with as much ease as I were entering the old den. The ambassadors are hand and
      glove with me. There are very few things I do not know. I have made the fortune of the
      ‘Chuck-Farthing,’ trebled its circulation, and invented a new style, which has put me at the
      head of all ‘our own correspondents.’ I wish you were at Paris; I would give you a dinner at
      the Rocher, which would make up for all our dinners at that ferocious ruffian, Joe’s. I gave a
      dinner the other day to forty of them, all ‘our own correspondents,’ or such like. Do you
      know, my dear fellow, when I looked round the room, there was not a man who had not done his
      best to crush me; running down my works or not noticing them, or continually dilating on Gushy
      as if the English public would never read anything else. Now, that was Christian-like of me,
      was not it? God, sir, if they only had but one neck, and I had been the Emperor Nero—but, I
      will not dwell on it; I hate them. However, it suits me to take the other line at present. I
      am all for fraternity and that sort of thing, and give them dinners. There is a reason why,
      but there is no time to talk about that now. I shall want their sweet voices—the hounds! But,
      my dear fellow, I am truly glad to see you. Do you know, I always liked you; and how come you
      to be in this quarter this fine morning?”</p>
     <p>“I live in the Albany,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“You live in the Albany!” repeated St. Barbe, with an amazed and perturbed expression. “I
      knew I could not be a knight of the garter, or a member of White’s—the only two things an
      Englishman cannot command; but I did think I might some day live in the Albany. It was my
      dream. And you live there! Gracious! what an unfortunate fellow I am! I do not see how you can
      live in the Albany with your salary; I suppose they have raised you.”</p>
     <p>“I have left Somerset House,” said Endymion, “and am now at the Board of Trade, and am
      private secretary to Mr. Sidney Wilton.”</p>
     <p>“Oh!” said St. Barbe; “then we have friends at court. You may do something for me, if I only
      knew what I wanted. They have no decorations here. Curse this aristocratic country, they want
      all the honours to themselves. I should like to be in the Board of Trade, and would make some
      sacrifice for it. The proprietors of the ‘Chuck-Farthing’ pay well; they pay like gentlemen;
      though, why I say so I do not exactly know, for no gentleman ever paid me anything. But, if I
      could be Secretary of the Board of Trade, or get 1500 pounds a year secure, I would take it;
      and I dare say I could get employed on some treaties, as I speak French, and then I might get
      knighted.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I think you are very well off,” said Endymion; “carrying, as you say, everything
      before you. What more can you want?”</p>
     <p>“I hate the craft,” said St. Barbe, with an expression of genuine detestation; “I should
      like to show them all up before I died. I suppose it was your sister marrying a lord that got
      you on in this way. I could have married a countess myself, but then, to be sure, she was only
      a Polish one, and hard up. I never had a sister; I never had any luck in life at all. I wish I
      had been a woman. Women are the only people who get on. A man works all his life, and thinks
      he has done a wonderful thing if, with one leg in the grave and no hair on his head, he
      manages to get a coronet; and a woman dances at a ball with some young fellow or other, or
      sits next to some old fellow at dinner and pretends she thinks him charming, and he makes her
      a peeress on the spot. Oh! it is a disgusting world; it must end in revolution. Now you tell
      your master, Mr. Sidney Wilton, that if he wants to strengthen the institutions of this
      country, the government should establish an order of merit, and the press ought to be
      represented in it. I do not speak only for myself; I speak for my brethren. Yes, sir, I am not
      ashamed of my order.”</p>
     <p>And so they bade each other farewell.</p>
     <p>“Unchanged,” thought Endymion, as he crossed Piccadilly; “the vainest, the most envious, and
      the most amusing of men! I wonder what he will do in life.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Rodney was at home, had just finished his breakfast, read his newspaper, and was about
      to “go into the City.” His costume was perfect. Mr. Rodney’s hat seemed always a new one.
      Endymion was a little embarrassed by this interview, for he had naturally a kind heart, and
      being young, it was still soft. The Rodneys had been truly good to him, and he was attached to
      them. Imogene had prepared Mr. Rodney for the change in Endymion’s life, and Endymion himself
      had every reason to believe that in a worldly point of view the matter was entirely
      insignificant to his old landlord. Still his visit this morning ratified a permanent
      separation from those with whom he had lived for a long time, and under circumstances of
      sympathy and family connection which were touching. He retained Mr. Rodney’s hand for a moment
      as he expressed, and almost in faltering tones, his sorrow at their separation and his hope
      that their friendly connection might be always cherished.</p>
     <p>“That feeling is reciprocal,” said Mr. Rodney. “If only because you were the son of my
      revered and right honourable friend, you would always be esteemed here. But you are esteemed,
      or, I may say beloved, for your own sake. We shall be proud to be considered with kindness by
      you, and I echo your wish that, though no longer living under the same roof, we may yet, and
      even often, meet. But do not say another word about the inconvenience you are occasioning us.
      The truth is, that although wherever we went the son of my revered and right honourable friend
      would have always commanded hospitality from us, there are many changes about to take place in
      our family which have made us for some time contemplate leaving Warwick Street. Affairs,
      especially of late, have gone pretty well with me in the world,—at least not badly; I have had
      friends, and I hope have proved not undeserving of them. I wish Sylvia, too, to live in an
      airier situation, near the park, so that she may ride every morning. Besides, I have a piece
      of news to communicate to you, which would materially affect our arrangements. We are going to
      lose Imogene.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! she is going to be married,” said Endymion, blushing.</p>
     <p>“She is going to be married,” said Mr. Rodney gravely.</p>
     <p>“To Mr. Waldershare?” said Endymion. “He almost said as much to me in a letter this morning.
      But I always thought so.”</p>
     <p>“No; not to Mr. Waldershare,” said Mr. Rodney.</p>
     <p>“Who is the happy man then?” said Endymion, agitated. “I truly call him so; for I think
      myself that Imogene is perfection.”</p>
     <p>“Imogene is about to be married to the Earl of Beaumaris.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LII</head>
     <p>Simon, Earl of Montfort, with whom Endymion was so unexpectedly going to dine, may be said
      to have been a minor in his cradle. Under ordinary circumstances, his inheritance would have
      been one of the most considerable in England. His castle in the north was one of the glories
      of the land, and becomingly crowned his vast domain. Under the old parliamentary system, he
      had the greatest number of nomination boroughs possessed by any Whig noble. The character and
      conduct of an individual so qualified were naturally much speculated on and finely scanned.
      Nothing very decided transpired about them in his boyhood, but certainly nothing adverse. He
      was good-looking and athletic, and was said to be generous and good-natured, and when he went
      to Harrow, he became popular. In his eighteenth year, while he was in correspondence with his
      guardians about going to Christ Church, he suddenly left his country without giving any one
      notice of his intentions, and entered into, and fulfilled, a vast scheme of adventurous
      travel. He visited countries then rarely reached, and some of which were almost unknown. His
      flag had floated in the Indian Ocean, and he had penetrated the dazzling mysteries of
      Brazilian forests. When he was of age, he returned, and communicated with his guardians, as if
      nothing remarkable had happened in his life. Lord Montfort had inherited a celebrated stud,
      which the family had maintained for more than a century, and the sporting world remarked with
      satisfaction that their present representative appeared to take much interest in it. He had an
      establishment at Newmarket, and his horses were entered for all the great races of the
      kingdom. He appeared also at Melton, and conducted the campaign in a style becoming such a
      hero. His hunters and his cooks were both first-rate. Although he affected to take little
      interest in politics, the events of the time forced him to consider them and to act. Lord Grey
      wanted to carry his Reform Bill, and the sacrifice of Lord Montfort’s numerous boroughs was a
      necessary ingredient in the spell. He was appealed to as the head of one of the greatest Whig
      houses, and he was offered a dukedom. He relinquished his boroughs without hesitation, but he
      preferred to remain with one of the oldest earldoms of England for his chief title. All
      honours, however, clustered about him, though he never sought them, and in the same year he
      tumbled into the Lord Lieutenancy of his county, unexpectedly vacant, and became the youngest
      Knight of the Garter.</p>
     <p>Society was looking forward with the keenest interest to the impending season, when Lord
      Montfort would formally enter its spell-bound ranks, and multiform were the speculations on
      his destiny. He attended an early levee, in order that he might be presented—a needful
      ceremony which had not yet taken place—and then again quitted his country, and for years. He
      was heard of in every capital except his own. Wonderful exploits at St. Petersburg, and Paris,
      and Madrid, deeds of mark at Vienna, and eccentric adventures at Rome; but poor Melton, alas!
      expecting him to return every season, at last embalmed him, and his cooks, and his hunters,
      and his daring saddle, as a tradition,—jealous a little of Newmarket, whither, though absent,
      he was frequently transmitting foreign blood, and where his horses still ran, and were often
      victorious.</p>
     <p>At last it would appear that the restless Lord Montfort had found his place, and that place
      was Paris. There he dwelt for years in Sybaritic seclusion. He built himself a palace, which
      he called a villa, and which was the most fanciful of structures, and full of every beautiful
      object which rare taste and boundless wealth could procure, from undoubted Raffaelles to
      jewelled toys. It was said that Lord Montfort saw no one; he certainly did not court or
      receive his own countrymen, and this perhaps gave rise to, or at least caused to be
      exaggerated, the tales that were rife of his profusion, and even his profligacy. But it was
      not true that he was entirely isolated. He lived much with the old families of France in their
      haughty faubourg, and was highly considered by them. It was truly a circle for which he was
      adapted. Lord Montfort was the only living Englishman who gave one an idea of the nobleman of
      the eighteenth century. He was totally devoid of the sense of responsibility, and he looked
      what he resembled. His manner, though simple and natural, was finished and refined, and, free
      from forbidding reserve, was yet characterised by an air of serious grace.</p>
     <p>With the exception of the memorable year when he sacrificed his nomination boroughs to the
      cause for which Hampden died on the field and Sidney on the scaffold—that is to say, the Whig
      government of England—Lord Montfort had been absent for his country for ten years, and one
      day, in his statued garden at the Belvedere, he asked himself what he had gained by it. There
      was no subject, divine or human, in which he took the slightest interest. He entertained for
      human nature generally, and without any exception, the most cynical appreciation. He had a
      sincere and profound conviction, that no man or woman ever acted except from selfish and
      interested motives. Society was intolerable to him; that of his own sex and station wearisome
      beyond expression; their conversation consisted only of two subjects, horses and women, and he
      had long exhausted both. As for female society, if they were ladies, it was expected that, in
      some form or other, he should make love to them, and he had no sentiment. If he took refuge in
      the <hi>demi-monde</hi>, he encountered vulgarity, and that, to Lord Montfort, was
      insufferable. He had tried them in every capital, and vulgarity was the badge of all their
      tribe. He had attempted to read; a woman had told him to read French novels, but he found them
      only a clumsy representation of the life which, for years, he had practically been leading. An
      accident made him acquainted with Rabelais and Montaigne; and he had relished them, for he had
      a fine sense of humour. He might have pursued these studies, and perhaps have found in them a
      slight and occasional distraction, but a clever man he met at a guingette at Passy, whither he
      had gone to try to dissipate his weariness in disguise, had convinced him, that if there were
      a worthy human pursuit, an assumption which was doubtful, it was that of science, as it
      impressed upon man his utter insignificance.</p>
     <p>No one could say Lord Montfort was a bad-hearted man, for he had no heart. He was
      good-natured, provided it brought him no inconvenience; and as for temper, his was never
      disturbed, but this not from sweetness of disposition, rather from a contemptuous fine taste,
      which assured him, that a gentleman should never be deprived of tranquillity in a world where
      nothing was of the slightest consequence.</p>
     <p>The result of these reflections was, that he was utterly wearied with Belvedere and Paris,
      and as his mind was now rather upon science, he fancied he should like to return to a country
      where it flourished, and where he indulged in plans of erecting colossal telescopes, and of
      promoting inquiry into the origin of things. He thought that with science and with fishing,
      the only sport to which he still really clung, for he liked the lulling influence of running
      streams, and a pastime he could pursue in loneliness, existence might perhaps be endured.</p>
     <p>Society was really surprised when they heard of the return of Lord Montfort to England. He
      came back in the autumn, so that there should be no season to encounter, and his flag was soon
      flying at his castle. There had been continuous attacks for years on the government for having
      made an absentee lord lieutenant of his country, and conferring the high distinction of the
      garter on so profligate a character. All this made his return more interesting and
      exciting.</p>
     <p>A worthy nobleman of high rank and of the same county, who for the last five years
      everybody, shaking everybody’s head, had been saying ought to have been lord lieutenant, had a
      great county function in his immediate neighbourhood in the late autumn, and had invited a
      large party to assist him in its celebration. It seemed right also to invite the lord
      lieutenant, but no one expected that he would make his appearance. On the contrary, the
      invitation was accepted, and the sensation was great. What would he be like, and what would he
      do, and was he so very wicked as the county newspaper said? He came, this wicked man, with his
      graceful presence and his diamond star, and everybody’s heart palpitated with a due mixture of
      terror and admiration. The only exception to these feelings was the daughter of the house, the
      Lady Berengaria. She was then in her second season, but still unparagoned, for she was a
      fastidious, not to say disdainful lady. The highest had been at her feet, and sued in vain.
      She was a stirring spirit, with great ambition and a daring will; never content except in
      society, and influencing it—for which she was qualified by her grace and lively fancy, her
      ready though capricious sympathy, and her passion for admiration.</p>
     <p>The function was successful, and the county full of enthusiasm for their lord lieutenant,
      whose manner quite cleared his character. The party did not break up, in fact the function was
      only an excuse for the party. There was sport of all kinds, and in the evenings a carnival—for
      Lady Berengaria required everybody about her to be gay and diverting—games and dances, and
      infinite frolic. Lord Montfort, who, to the surprise of every one, did not depart, spoke to
      her a little, and perhaps would not have spoken at all, had they not met in the hunting-field.
      Lady Berengaria was a first-rate horsewoman, and really in the saddle looked irresistible.</p>
     <p>The night before the party, which had lasted a week, broke up, Lord Montfort came and sat by
      Lady Berengaria. He spoke about the run of the morning, and she replied in the same vein. “I
      have got a horse, Lady Berengaria, which I should like you to ride. Would you do so?”</p>
     <p>“Certainly, and what sort of horse is it?”</p>
     <p>“You shall see to-morrow. It is not far off. I like to have some horses always near,” and
      then he walked away.</p>
     <p>It was a dark chestnut of matchless beauty. Lady Berengaria, who was of an emphatic nature,
      was loud in her admiration of its beauty and its hunting qualities.</p>
     <p>“I agree with you,” said Lord Montfort, “that it will spoil you for any other horse, and
      therefore I shall ask permission to leave it here for your use.”</p>
     <p>The party broke up, but, strange to say, Lord Montfort did not depart. It was a large
      family. Lady Berengaria had several sisters; her eldest brother was master of the hounds, and
      her younger brothers were asserting their rights as cadets, and killing their father’s
      pheasants. There was also a number of cousins, who were about the same age, and were always
      laughing, though it was never quite clear what it was about. An affectation of gaiety may be
      sometimes detected in youth.</p>
     <p>As Lord Montfort always had the duty of ushering the lady of the house to dinner, he never
      had the opportunity of conversing with Lady Berengaria, even had he wished it; but it was not
      all clear that he did wish it, and it seemed that he talked as much to her sisters and the
      laughing cousins as to herself, but still he did not go away, which was most strange, and
      commenced to be embarrassing.</p>
     <p>At last one evening, both her parents slumbering, one over the newspaper and the other over
      her work, and the rest of the party in a distant room playing at some new game amid occasional
      peals of laughter, Lord Montfort, who had been sitting for some time by Lady Berengaria’s
      side, and only asking now and then a question, though often a searching one, in order to
      secure her talking to him, rather abruptly said, “I wonder if anything would ever induce you
      to marry me?”</p>
     <p>This was the most startling social event of the generation. Society immediately set
      a-wondering how it would turn out, and proved very clearly that it must turn out badly. Men
      who knew Montfort well at Paris looked knowing, and said they would give it six months.</p>
     <p>But the lady was as remarkable a woman as the bridegroom was in his sex. Lady Berengaria was
      determined to be the Queen of Society, and had confidence in her unlimited influence over man.
      It is, however, rather difficult to work on the feelings of a man who has no heart. This she
      soon found out, and to her dismay, but she kept it a profound secret. By endless ingenuity on
      her part, affairs went on very well much longer than the world expected, and long enough to
      fulfil the object of Lady Berengaria’s life. Lord Montfort launched his wife well, and seemed
      even content to be occasionally her companion until she had mounted the social throne. He was
      proud of her as he would be of one of his beautiful horses; but when all the world had
      acknowledged the influence of Berengaria, he fell into one of his old moods, and broke to her
      that he could bear it no longer, and that he must retire from society. Lady Montfort looked
      distressed, but, resolved under no circumstances to be separated from her husband, whom she
      greatly admired, and to whom, had he wished it, she could have become even passionately
      attached, signified her readiness to share his solitude. But she then found out that this was
      not what he wanted. It was not only retirement from society, but retirement from Lady
      Montfort, that was indispensable. In short, at no time of his perverse career had Lord
      Montfort been more wilful.</p>
     <p>During the last years of his residence in Paris, when he was shut up in his delicious
      Belvedere, he had complained much of the state of his health, and one of his principal
      pursuits was consulting the faculty on this interesting subject. The faculty were unanimous in
      their opinion that the disorder from which their patient was suffering was <hi>Ennui</hi>.
      This persistent opinion irritated him, and was one of the elements of his decision to leave
      the country. The unexpected distraction that followed his return to his native land had made
      him neglect or forget his sad indisposition, but it appears that it had now returned, and in
      an aggravated form. Unhappily the English physicians took much the same view of the case as
      their French brethren. They could find nothing organically wrong in the constitution or
      condition of Lord Montfort, and recommended occupation and society. At present he shrank with
      some disgust at the prospect of returning to France, and he had taken it into his head that
      the climate of Montfort did not agree with him. He was convinced that he must live in the
      south of England. One of the most beautiful and considerable estates in that favoured part of
      our country was virtually in the market, and Lord Montfort, at the cost of half a million,
      became the proprietor of Princedown. And here he announced that he should dwell and die.</p>
     <p>This state of affairs was a bitter trial to the proudest woman in England, but Lady Montfort
      was also one of the most able. She resisted nothing, sympathised with all his projects, and
      watched her opportunity when she could extract from his unconscious good-nature some
      reasonable modification of them. And she ultimately succeeded in establishing a <hi>modus
       vivendi</hi>. He was to live and die at Princedown; that was settled; but if he ever came to
      town, to consult his physicians, for example, he was always to inhabit Montfort House, and if
      she occasionally required a whiff of southern air, she was to have her rooms always ready for
      her at Princedown. She would not interfere with him in the least; he need not even see her, if
      he were too unwell. Then as to the general principle of his life, it was quite clear that he
      was not interested in anything, and never would be interested in anything; but there was no
      reason that he should not be amused. This distinction between interest and amusement rather
      pleased, and seemed to satisfy Lord Montfort—but then it was difficult to amuse him. The only
      thing that ever amused him, he said, were his wife’s letters, and as he was the most selfish
      as well as the most polite of men, he requested her to write to him every day. Great
      personages, who are selfish and whimsical, are generally surrounded by parasites and buffoons,
      but this would not suit Lord Montfort; he sincerely detested flattery, and he wearied in
      eight-and-forty hours of the most successful mountebank in society. What he seemed inclined to
      was the society of men of science, of travellers in rare parts, and of clever artists; in
      short, of all persons who had what he called “idiosyncrasy.” Civil engineering was then
      beginning to attract general attention, and Lord Montfort liked the society of civil
      engineers; but what he liked most were self-formed men, and to learn the secret of their
      success, and how they made their fortune. After the first fit of Princedown was over, Lord
      Montfort found that it was impossible, even with all its fascination, to secure a constant, or
      sufficient, presence of civil engineers in such distant parts, and so he got into the habit of
      coming up to Montfort House, that he might find companions and be amused. Lady Montfort took
      great pains that he should not be disappointed, and catered for him with all the skill of an
      accomplished <hi>chef</hi>. Then, when the occasion served, she went down to Princedown
      herself with welcome guests—and so it turned out, that circumstances, which treated by an
      ordinary mind must have led to a social scandal, were so adroitly manipulated, that the world
      little apprehended the real and somewhat mortifying state of affairs. With the utmost license
      of ill-nature, they could not suppose that Lord and Lady Montfort, living under the same roof,
      might scarcely see each other for weeks, and that his communications with her, and indeed
      generally, were always made in writing.</p>
     <p>Lady Monfort never could agree with her husband in the cardinal assumption of his
      philosophy. One of his reasons for never doing anything was, that there was nothing for him to
      attain. He had got everything. Here they at once separated in their conclusions. Lady Montfort
      maintained they had got nothing. “What,” she would say, “are rank and wealth to us? We were
      born to them. We want something that we were not born to. You reason like a parvenu. Of
      course, if you had created your rank and your riches, you might rest on your oars, and find
      excitement in the recollection of what you had achieved. A man of your position ought to
      govern the country, and it always was so in the old days. Your family were prime ministers;
      why not you, with as much talent, and much more knowledge?”</p>
     <p>“You would make a very good prime minister, Berengaria.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! you always jest, I am serious.”</p>
     <p>“And so am I. If I ever am to work, I would sooner be a civil engineer than a prime
      minister.”</p>
     <p>Nothing but the indomitable spirit of Lady Montfort could fight successfully against such
      obstacles to her schemes of power as were presented by the peculiar disposition of her lord.
      Her receptions every Saturday night during the season were the most important of social
      gatherings, but she held them alone. It was by consummate skill that she had prevailed upon
      her lord occasionally appearing at the preceding banquets, and when they were over, he flitted
      for an instant and disappeared. At first, he altogether refused, but then Lady Montfort would
      introduce Royalty, always kind, to condescend to express a wish to dine at Montfort House, and
      that was a gracious intimation it was impossible not to act upon, and then, as Lady Montfort
      would say, “I trust much to the periodical visits of that dear Queen of Mesopotamia. He must
      entertain her, for his father was her lover.”</p>
     <p>In this wonderful mystification, by which Lord Montfort was made to appear as living in a
      society which he scarcely ever entered, his wife was a little assisted by his visits to
      Newmarket, which he even frequently attended. He never made a bet or a new acquaintance, but
      he seemed to like meeting men with whom he had been at school. There is certainly a magic in
      the memory of school-boy friendships; it softens the heart, and even affects the nervous
      system of those who have no hearts. Lord Montfort at Newmarket would ask half a dozen men who
      had been at school with him, and were now members of the Jockey Club, to be his guests, and
      the next day all over the heath, and after the heath, all over Mayfair and Belgravia, you
      heard only one speech, “I dined yesterday,” or “the other day,” as the case might be, “with
      Montfort; out and out the best dinner I ever had, and such an agreeable fellow; the wittiest,
      the most amusing, certainly the most charming fellow that ever lived; out and out! It is a
      pity he does not show a little more.” And society thought the same; they thought it a pity,
      and a great one, that this fascinating being of whom they rarely caught a glimpse, and who to
      them took the form of a wasted and unsympathising phantom, should not show a little more and
      delight them. But the most curious thing was, that however rapturous were his guests, the
      feelings of their host after they had left him, were by no means reciprocal. On the contrary,
      he would remark to himself, “Have I heard a single thing worth remembering? Not one.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER LIII</head>
     <p>Endymion was a little agitated when he arrived at the door of Montfort House, a huge family
      mansion, situate in a court-yard and looking into the Green Park. When the door was opened he
      found himself in a large hall with many servants, and he was ushered through several rooms on
      the ground floor, into a capacious chamber dimly lighted, where there were several gentlemen,
      but not his hostess. His name was announced, and then a young man came up to him and mentioned
      that Lord and Lady Montfort would soon be present, and then talked to him about the weather.
      The Count of Ferroll arrived after Endymion, and then another gentleman whose name he could
      not catch. Then while he was making some original observations on the east wind, and, to
      confess the truth, feeling anything but at his ease, the folding doors of a further chamber
      brilliantly lighted were thrown open, and almost at the same moment Lady Montfort entered,
      and, taking the Count of Ferroll’s arm, walked into the dining-room. It was a round table, and
      Endymion was told by the same gentleman who had already addressed him, that he was to sit by
      Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Lord Montfort is a little late to-day,” she said, “but he wished me not to wait for him.
      And how are you after our parliamentary banquet?” she said, turning to Endymion; “I will
      introduce you to the Count of Ferroll.”</p>
     <p>The Count of Ferroll was a young man, and yet inclined to be bald. He was chief of a not
      inconsiderable mission at our court. Though not to be described as a handsome man, his
      countenance was striking; a brow of much intellectual development, and a massive jaw. He was
      tall, broad-shouldered, with a slender waist. He greeted Endymion with a penetrating glance,
      and then with a winning smile.</p>
     <p>The Count of Ferroll was the representative of a kingdom which, if not exactly created, had
      been moulded into a certain form of apparent strength and importance by the Congress of
      Vienna. He was a noble of considerable estate in a country where possessions were not
      extensive or fortunes large, though it was ruled by an ancient, and haughty, and warlike
      aristocracy. Like his class, the Count of Ferroll had received a military education; but when
      that education was completed, he found but a feeble prospect of his acquirements being called
      into action. It was believed that the age of great wars had ceased, and that even revolutions
      were for the future to be controlled by diplomacy. As he was a man of an original, not to say
      eccentric, turn of mind, the Count of Ferroll was not contented with the resources and
      distraction of his second-rate capital. He was an eminent sportsman, and, for some time, took
      refuge and found excitement in the breadth of his dark forests, and in the formation of a
      stud, which had already become celebrated. But all this time, even in the excitement of the
      chase, and in the raising of his rare-breed steeds, the Count of Ferroll might be said to have
      been brooding over the position of what he could scarcely call his country, but rather an
      aggregation of lands baptized by protocols, and christened and consolidated by treaties which
      he looked upon as eminently untrustworthy. One day he surprised his sovereign, with whom he
      was a favourite, by requesting to be appointed to the legation at London, which was vacant.
      The appointment was at once made, and the Count of Ferroll had now been two years at the Court
      of St. James’.</p>
     <p>The Count of Ferroll was a favourite in English society, for he possessed every quality
      which there conduces to success. He was of great family and of distinguished appearance,
      munificent and singularly frank; was a dead-shot, and the boldest of riders, with horses which
      were the admiration alike of Melton and Newmarket. The ladies also approved of him, for he was
      a consummate waltzer, and mixed with a badinage gaily cynical a tone that could be tender and
      a bewitching smile.</p>
     <p>But his great friend was Lady Montfort. He told her everything, and consulted her on
      everything; and though he rarely praised anybody, it had reached her ears that the Count of
      Ferroll had said more than once that she was a greater woman than Louise of Savoy or the
      Duchesse de Longueville.</p>
     <p>There was a slight rustling in the room. A gentleman had entered and glided into his
      unoccupied chair, which his valet had guarded. “I fear I am not in time for an oyster,” said
      Lord Montfort to his neighbour.</p>
     <p>The gentleman who had first spoken to Endymion was the secretary of Lord Montfort; then
      there was a great genius who was projecting a suspension bridge over the Tyne, and that was in
      Lord Montfort’s county. A distinguished officer of the British Museum completed the party with
      a person who sate opposite Endymion, and whom in the dim twilight he had not recognised, but
      whom he now beheld with no little emotion. It was Nigel Penruddock. They had not met since his
      mother’s funeral, and the associations of the past agitated Endymion. They exchanged
      recognitions; that of Nigel was grave but kind.</p>
     <p>The conversation was what is called general, and a great deal on suspension bridges. Lord
      Montfort himself led off on this, in order to bring out his distinguished guest. The Count of
      Ferroll was also interested on this subject, as his own government was making inquiries on the
      matter. The gentleman from the British Museum made some remarks on the mode in which the
      ancient Egyptians moved masses of granite, and quoted Herodotus to the civil engineer. The
      civil engineer had never heard of Herodotus, but he said he was going to Egypt in the autumn
      by desire of Mehemet Ali, and he would undertake to move any mass which was requisite, even if
      it were a pyramid itself. Lady Montfort, without disturbing the general conversation,
      whispered in turns to the Count of Ferroll and Endymion, and told the latter that she had paid
      a visit to Lady Roehampton in the morning—a most delightful visit. There was no person she
      admired so much as his sister; she quite loved her. The only person who was silent was Nigel,
      but Lady Montfort, who perceived everything, addressed him across the table with enthusiasm
      about some changes he had made in the services of some church, and the countenance of Nigel
      became suffused like a young saint who has a glimpse of Paradise.</p>
     <p>After dinner Lady Montfort led Endymion to her lord, and left him seated by his host. Lord
      Montfort was affable and natural in his manner. He said, “I have not yet made the acquaintance
      of Lady Roehampton, for I never go out; but I hope to do so, for Lady Montfort tells me she is
      quite captivating.”</p>
     <p>“She is a very good sister,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Lady Montfort has told me a great deal about yourself, and all of it I was glad to hear. I
      like young men who rise by their merits, and Mr. Sidney Wilton tells Lady Montfort that yours
      are distinguished.”</p>
     <p>“Mr. Sidney Wilton is a kind master, sir.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I was his fag at Harrow, and I thought him so,” said Lord Montfort. “And now about
      your office; tell me what you do. You were not there first, Lady Montfort says. Where were you
      first? Tell me all about it. I like detail.”</p>
     <p>It was impossible to resist such polished and amiable curiosity, and Endymion gratified it
      with youthful grace. He even gave Lord Montfort a sketch of St. Barbe, inspired probably by
      the interview of the morning. Lord Montfort was quite amused with this, and said he should so
      much like to know Mr. St. Barbe. It was clear, when the party broke up, that Endymion had made
      a favourable impression, for Lord Montfort said, “You came here to-day as Lady Montfort’s
      friend, but you must come in future as mine also. And will you understand, I dine at home
      every day when I am in town, and I give you a general invitation. Come as often as you like;
      you will be always welcome. Only let the house know your intention an hour before dinner-time,
      as I have a particular aversion to the table being crowded, or seeing an empty chair.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort had passed much of the evening in earnest conversation with Nigel, and when
      the guests quitted the room, Nigel and Endymion walked away together.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LIV</head>
     <p>The meeting between Nigel and Endymion was not an ordinary one, and when they were at length
      alone, neither of them concealed his feelings of pleasure and surprise at its occurrence.
      Nigel had been a curate in the northern town which was defended by Lord Montfort’s proud
      castle, and his labours and reputation had attracted the attention of Lady Montfort. Under the
      influence of his powerful character, the services of his church were celebrated with a
      precision and an imposing effect, which soon occasioned a considerable excitement in the
      neighbourhood, in time even in the county. The pulpit was frequently at his command, for his
      rector, who had imbibed his Church views, was not equal to the task of propagating them, and
      the power and fame of Nigel as a preacher began to be much rumoured. Although the church at
      which he officiated was not the one which Lady Montfort usually attended, she was soon among
      his congregation and remained there. He became a constant guest at the castle, and Lady
      Montfort presented his church with a reredos of alabaster. She did more than this. Her
      enthusiasm exceeded her selfishness, for though the sacrifice was great which would deprive
      her of the ministrations and society of Nigel in the country, she prevailed upon the prime
      minister to prefer him to a new church in London, which had just fallen vacant, and which,
      being situated in a wealthy and populous district, would afford him the opportunity of making
      known to the world his eloquence and genius. This was Nigel’s simple, yet not uneventful
      history; and then, in turn, he listened to Endymion’s brief but interesting narrative of his
      career, and then they agreed to adjourn to Endymion’s chambers and have a good talk over the
      past and the present.</p>
     <p>“That Lady Montfort is a great woman,” said Nigel, standing with his back to the fire. “She
      has it in her to be another Empress Helena.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed!”</p>
     <p>“I believe she has only one thought, and that the only thought worthy the human mind—the
      Church. I was glad to meet you at her house. You have cherished, I hope, those views which in
      your boyhood you so fervently and seriously embraced.”</p>
     <p>“I am rather surprised,” said Endymion, not caring to answer this inquiry, “at a Whig lady
      entertaining such high views in these matters. The Liberal party rather depends on the Low
      Church.”</p>
     <p>“I know nothing about Whigs or Tories or Liberals, or any other new names which they
      invent,” said Nigel. “Nor do I know, or care to know, what Low Church means. There is but one
      Church, and it is catholic and apostolic; and if we act on its principles, there will be no
      need, and there ought to be no need, for any other form of government.”</p>
     <p>“Well, those are very distinct views,” said Endymion, “but are they as practical as they are
      clear?”</p>
     <p>“Why should they not be practical? Everything is practical which we believe; and in the long
      run, which is most likely that we should believe, what is taught by God, or what is taught by
      man?”</p>
     <p>“I confess,” said Endymion, “that in all matters, both civil and religious, I incline to
      what is moderate and temperate. I always trace my dear father’s sad end, and all the terrible
      events in my family, to his adopting in 1829 the views of the extreme party. If he had only
      followed the example and the advice of his best friend, Mr. Sidney Wilton, what a different
      state of affairs might have occurred!”</p>
     <p>“I know nothing about politics,” said Nigel. “By being moderate and temperate in politics I
      suppose you mean being adroit, and doing that which is expedient and which will probably be
      successful. But the Church is founded on absolute truth, and teaches absolute truth, and there
      can be no compromise on such matters.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not know,” said Endymion, “but surely there are many very religious people, who
      do not accept without reserve everything that is taught by the Church. I hope I am a religious
      person myself, and yet, for example, I cannot give an unreserved assent to the whole of the
      Athanasian Creed.”</p>
     <p>“The Athanasian Creed is the most splendid ecclesiastical lyric ever poured forth by the
      genius of man. I give to every clause of it an implicit assent. It does not pretend to be
      divine; it is human, but the Church has hallowed it, and the Church ever acts under the
      influence of the Divine Spirit. St. Athanasius was by far the greatest man that ever existed.
      If you cavil at his creed, you will soon cavil at other symbols. I was prepared for infidelity
      in London, but I confess, my dear Ferrars, you alarm me. I was in hopes that your early
      education would have saved you from this backsliding.”</p>
     <p>“But let us be calm, my dear Nigel. Do you mean to say, that I am to be considered an
      infidel or an apostate, because, although I fervently embrace all the vital truths of
      religion, and try, on the whole, to regulate my life by them, I may have scruples about
      believing, for example, in the personality of the Devil?”</p>
     <p>“If the personality of Satan be not a vital principle of your religion, I do not know what
      is. There is only one dogma higher. You think it is safe, and I daresay it is fashionable, to
      fall into this lax and really thoughtless discrimination between what is and what is not to be
      believed. It is not good taste to believe in the Devil. Give me a single argument against his
      personality which is not applicable to the personality of the Deity. Will you give that up;
      and if so, where are you? Now mark me; you and I are young men—you are a very young man. This
      is the year of grace 1839. If these loose thoughts, which you have heedlessly taken up,
      prevail in this country for a generation or so—five and twenty or thirty years—we may meet
      together again, and I shall have to convince you that there is a God.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LV</head>
     <p>The balance of parties in the House of Commons, which had been virtually restored by Sir
      Robert Peel’s dissolution of 1834, might be said to be formally and positively established by
      the dissolution of parliament in the autumn of 1837, occasioned by the demise of the crown.
      The ministerial majority became almost nominal, while troubles from all quarters seemed to
      press simultaneously upon them: Canadian revolts, Chartist insurrections, Chinese squabbles,
      and mysterious complications in Central Asia, which threatened immediate hostilities with
      Persia, and even with one of the most powerful of European empires. In addition to all this,
      the revenue continually declined, and every day the general prejudice became more intense
      against the Irish policy of the ministry. The extreme popularity of the Sovereign, reflecting
      some lustre on her ministers, had enabled them, though not without difficulty, to tide through
      the session of 1838; but when parliament met in 1839 their prospects were dark, and it was
      known that there was a section of the extreme Liberals who would not be deeply mortified if
      the government were overthrown. All efforts, therefore, political and social, and particularly
      the latter, in which the Whigs excelled, were to be made to prevent or to retard the
      catastrophe.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort and Lady Roehampton opened their houses to the general world at an unusually
      early period. Their entertainments rivalled those of Zenobia, who with unflagging gallantry,
      her radiant face prescient of triumph, stopped her bright vis-a-vis and her tall footmen in
      the midst of St. James’ Street or Pall Mall, while she rapidly inquired from some friendly
      passer-by whom she had observed, “Tell me the names of the Radical members who want to turn
      out the government, and I will invite them directly.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort had appropriated the Saturdays, as was her custom and her right; so Myra, with
      the advice of Lord Roehampton, had fixed on Wednesdays for her receptions.</p>
     <p>“I should have liked to have taken Wednesdays,” said Zenobia, “but I do not care to seem to
      be setting up against Lady Roehampton, for her mother was my dearest friend. Not that I think
      any quarter ought to be shown to her after joining those atrocious Whigs, but to be sure she
      was corrupted by her husband, whom I remember the most thorough Tory going. To be sure, I was
      a Whig myself in those days, so one must not say too much about it, but the Whigs then were
      gentlemen. I will tell you what I will do. I will receive both on Saturdays and Wednesdays. It
      is an effort, and I am not as young as I was, but it will only be for a season or less, for I
      know these people cannot stand. It will be all over by May.”</p>
     <p>Prince Florestan had arrived in town, and was now settled in his mansion in Carlton Terrace.
      It was the fashion among the <hi>creme de la creme</hi> to keep aloof from him. The Tories did
      not love revolutionary dynasties, and the Whigs being in office could not sanction a
      pretender, and one who, they significantly intimated with a charitable shrug of the shoulders,
      was not a very scrupulous one. The prince himself, though he was not insensible to the charms
      of society, and especially of agreeable women, was not much chagrined by this. The world
      thought that he had fitted up his fine house, and bought his fine horses, merely for the
      enjoyment of life. His purposes were very different. Though his acquaintances were limited,
      they were not undistinguished, and he lived with them in intimacy. There had arisen between
      himself and Mr. Waldershare the closest alliance both of thought and habits. They were rarely
      separated. The prince was also a frequent guest at the Neuchatels’, and was a favourite with
      the head of the house.</p>
     <p>The Duke of St. Angelo controlled the household at Carlton Gardens with skill. The
      appointments were finished and the cuisine refined. There was a dinner twice a week, from
      which Waldershare was rarely absent, and to which Endymion, whom the prince always treated
      with kindness, had a general invitation. When he occasionally dined there he met always
      several foreign guests, and all men apparently of mark—at any rate, all distinguished by their
      intelligence. It was an interesting and useful house for a young man, and especially a young
      politician, to frequent. Endymion heard many things and learnt many things which otherwise
      would not have met his ear or mind. The prince encouraged conversation, though himself
      inclined to taciturnity. When he did speak, his terse remarks and condensed views were
      striking, and were remembered. On the days on which he did not receive, the prince dined at
      the Travellers’ Club, to which Waldershare had obtained his introduction, and generally with
      Waldershare, who took this opportunity of gradually making his friend acquainted with eminent
      and influential men, many of whom in due time became guests at Carlton Terrace. It was clear,
      indeed, that these club-dinners were part of a system.</p>
     <p>The prince, soon after his arrival in town, while riding, had passed Lady Roehampton’s
      carriage in the park, and he had saluted her with a grave grace which distinguished him. She
      was surprised at feeling a little agitated by this rencontre. It recalled Hainault, her not
      mortifying but still humble position beneath that roof, the prince’s courtesy to her under
      those circumstances, and, indeed, his marked preference for her society. She felt it something
      like ingratitude to treat him with neglect now, when her position was so changed and had
      become so elevated. She mentioned to Lord Roehampton, while they were dining alone, that she
      should like to invite the prince to her receptions, and asked his opinion on the point. Lord
      Roehampton shrugged his shoulders and did not encourage her. “You know, my darling, our people
      do not much like him. They look upon him as a pretender, as having forfeited his parole, and
      as a refugee from justice. I have no prejudices against him myself, and perhaps in the same
      situation might have acted in the same manner; but if he is to be admitted into society, it
      should hardly be at a ministerial reception, and of all houses, that of one who holds my
      particular post.”</p>
     <p>“I know nothing about his forfeiting his parole,” said Lady Roehampton; “the charge is
      involved in mystery, and Mr. Waldershare told me it was an entire fabrication. As for his
      being a pretender, he seems to me as legitimate a prince as most we meet; he was born in the
      purple, and his father was recognised by every government in Europe except our own. As for
      being a refugee from justice, a prince in captivity has certainly a right to escape if he can,
      and his escape was romantic. However, I will not contest any decision of yours, for I think
      you are always right. Only I am disappointed, for, to say nothing of the unkindness, I cannot
      help feeling our not noticing him is rather shabby.”</p>
     <p>There was silence, a longer silence than usually occurred in <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> dinners
      between Lord and Lady Roehampton. To break the silence he began to converse on another
      subject, and Lady Roehampton replied to him cheerfully, but curtly. He saw she was vexed, and
      this great man, who was at that time meditating one of the most daring acts of modern
      diplomacy, who had the reputation, in the conduct of public affairs, of not only being
      courageous, but of being stern, inflexible, unfeeling, and unscrupulous beyond ordinary
      statesmen, who had passed his mornings in writing a menacing despatch to a great power and
      intimating combinations to the ambassadors of other first-rate states which they almost
      trembled to receive, was quite upset by seeing his wife chagrined. At last, after another
      embarrassing pause, he said gaily, “Do you know, my dear Myra, I do not see why you should not
      ask Prince Florestan. It is you that ask him, not I. That is one of the pleasant results of
      our system of political entertainments. The guests come to pay their respects to the lady of
      the house, so no one is committed. The prince may visit you on Wednesday just as well as the
      leaders of the opposition who want our places, or the malcontent Radicals who they say are
      going to turn us out.”</p>
     <p>So Prince Florestan was invited to Lady Roehampton’s receptions, and he came; and he never
      missed one. His visits were brief. He appeared, made his bow, had the pleasure of some slight
      conversation with her, and then soon retired. Received by Lady Roehampton, in time, though
      sluggishly, invitations arrived from other houses, but he rarely availed himself of them. He
      maintained in this respect great reserve, and was accustomed to say that the only fine lady in
      London who had ever been kind to him was Lady Roehampton.</p>
     <p>All this time Endymion, who was now thoroughly planted in society, saw a great deal of the
      Neuchatels, who had returned to Portland Place at the beginning of February. He met Adriana
      almost every evening, and was frequently invited to the house—to the grand dinners now, as
      well as the domestic circle. In short, our Endymion was fast becoming a young man of fashion
      and a personage. The brother of Lady Roehampton had now become the private secretary of Mr.
      Sydney Wilton and the great friend of Lady Montfort. He was indeed only one of the numerous
      admirers of that lady, but he seemed not the least smiled on. There was never anything
      delightful at Montfort House at which he was not present, or indeed in any other place, for
      under her influence, invitations from the most distinguished houses crowded his mantelpiece
      and were stuck all round his looking-glass. Endymion in this whirl of life did not forget his
      old friends. He took care that Seymour Hicks should have a frequent invitation to Lady
      Roehampton’s assemblies. Seymour Hicks only wanted a lever to raise the globe, and this
      introduction supplied him with one. It was astonishing how he made his way in society, and
      though, of course, he never touched the empyrean regions in which Endymion now breathed, he
      gradually, and at last rapidly, planted himself in a world which to the uninitiated figures as
      the very realm of nobility and fashion, and where doubtless is found a great fund of
      splendour, refinement, and amusement. Seymour Hicks was not ill-favoured, and was always well
      dressed, and he was very civil, but what he really owed his social advancement to was his
      indomitable will. That quality governs all things, and though the will of Seymour Hicks was
      directed to what many may deem a petty or a contracted purpose, life is always interesting
      when you have a purpose and live in its fulfilment. It appeared from what he told Endymion
      that matters at the office had altered a good deal since he left it. The retirement of St.
      Barbe was the first brick out of the wall; now, which Endymion had not yet heard, the brother
      of Trenchard had most unexpectedly died, and that gentleman come into a good estate. “Jawett
      remains, and is also the editor of the ‘Precursor,’ but his new labours so absorb his spare
      time that he is always at the office of the paper. So it is pretty well all over with the
      table at Joe’s. I confess I could not stand it any longer, particularly after you left. I have
      got into the junior Pan-Ionian; and I am down for the senior; I cannot get in for ten years,
      but when I do it will be a <hi>coup</hi>; the society there is tiptop, a cabinet minister
      sometimes, and very often a bishop.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER LVI</head>
     <p>Endymion was glad to meet Baron Sergius one day when he dined with Prince Florestan. There
      were several distinguished foreigners among the guests, who had just arrived. They talked
      much, and with much emphasis. One of them, the Marquis of Vallombrosa, expatiated on the Latin
      race, their great qualities, their vivacity, invention, vividness of perception, chivalrous
      valour, and sympathy with tradition. The northern races detested them, and the height of
      statesmanship was to combine the Latin races into an organised and active alliance against the
      barbarism which menaced them. There had been for a short time a vacant place next to Endymion,
      when Baron Sergius, according to his quiet manner, stole into the room and slipped into the
      unoccupied seat. “It is some time since we met,” he said, “but I have heard of you. You are
      now a public man, and not a public character. That is a not unsatisfactory position.”</p>
     <p>The prince listened apparently with much interest to the Marquis of Vallombrosa,
      occasionally asked him a question, and promoted discussion without himself giving any opinion.
      Baron Sergius never spoke except to Endymion, and then chiefly social inquiries about Lord and
      Lady Roehampton, their good friends the Neuchatels, and frequently about Mr. Sidney Wilton,
      whom, it appeared, he had known years ago, and intimately. After dinner the guests, on the
      return to the saloon, ranged themselves in a circle, but not too formally, and the prince
      moving round addressed each of them in turn. When this royal ceremony was concluded, the
      prince motioned to the Marquis of Vallombrosa to accompany him, and then they repaired to an
      adjacent salon, the door of which was open, but where they could converse without observation.
      The Duke of St. Angelo amused the remaining guests with all the resources of a man practised
      in making people feel at their ease, and in this he was soon greatly assisted by Mr.
      Waldershare, who was unable to dine with the prince to-day, but who seemed to take much
      interest in this arrival of the representatives of the Latin race.</p>
     <p>Baron Sergius and Endymion were sitting together rather apart from the rest. The baron said,
      “You have heard to-day a great deal about the Latin race, their wondrous qualities, their
      peculiar destiny, their possible danger. It is a new idea, or rather a new phrase, that I
      observe is now getting into the political world, and is probably destined to produce
      consequences. No man will treat with indifference the principle of race. It is the key of
      history, and why history is often so confused is that it has been written by men who were
      ignorant of this principle and all the knowledge it involves. As one who may become a
      statesman and assist in governing mankind, it is necessary that you should not be insensible
      to it; whether you encounter its influence in communities or in individuals, its qualities
      must ever be taken into account. But there is no subject which more requires discriminating
      knowledge, or where your illustrating principle, if you are not deeply founded, may not chance
      to turn out a will-o’-the-wisp. Now this great question of the Latin race, by which M. de
      Vallombrosa may succeed in disturbing the world—it might be well to inquire where the Latin
      race is to be found. In the North of Italy, peopled by Germans and named after Germans, or in
      the South of Italy, swarming with the descendants of Normans and Arabs? Shall we find the
      Latin race in Spain, stocked by Goths, and Moors, and Jews? Or in France, where there is a
      great Celtic nation, occasionally mingled with Franks? Now I do not want to go into the origin
      of man and nations—I am essentially practical, and only endeavour to comprehend that with
      which I have personally to deal, and that is sufficiently difficult. In Europe I find three
      great races with distinct qualities—the Teutons, the Sclaves, and the Celts; and their conduct
      will be influenced by those distinctive qualities. There is another great race which
      influences the world, the Semites. Certainly, when I was at the Congress of Vienna, I did not
      believe that the Arabs were more likely to become a conquering race again than the Tartars,
      and yet it is a question at this moment whether Mehemet Ali, at their head, may not found a
      new empire in the Mediterranean. The Semites are unquestionably a great race, for among the
      few things in this world which appear to be certain, nothing is more sure than that they
      invented our alphabet. But the Semites now exercise a vast influence over affairs by their
      smallest though most peculiar family, the Jews. There is no race gifted with so much tenacity,
      and such skill in organisation. These qualities have given them an unprecedented hold over
      property and illimitable credit. As you advance in life, and get experience in affairs, the
      Jews will cross you everywhere. They have long been stealing into our secret diplomacy, which
      they have almost appropriated; in another quarter of a century they will claim their share of
      open government. Well, these are races; men and bodies of men influenced in their conduct by
      their particular organisation, and which must enter into all the calculations of a statesman.
      But what do they mean by the Latin race? Language and religion do not make a race—there is
      only one thing which makes a race, and that is blood.”</p>
     <p>“But the prince,” said Endymion inquiringly; “he seemed much interested in what M. de
      Vallombrosa was saying; I should like to know what his opinions are about the Latin race.”</p>
     <p>“The prince rarely gives an opinion,” said the baron. “Indeed, as you well know, he rarely
      speaks; he thinks and he acts.”</p>
     <p>“But if he acts on wrong information,” continued Endymion, “there will probably be only one
      consequence.”</p>
     <p>“The prince is very wise,” said the baron; “and, trust me, knows as much about mankind, and
      the varieties of mankind, as any one. He may not believe in the Latin race, but he may choose
      to use those who do believe in it. The weakness of the prince, if he have one, is not want of
      knowledge, or want of judgment, but an over-confidence in his star, which sometimes seduces
      him into enterprises which he himself feels at the time are not perfectly sound.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LVII</head>
     <p>The interest of the town was now divided between the danger of the government and the new
      preacher who electrified the world at St. Rosicrucius. The Rev. Nigel Penruddock was not at
      all a popular preacher according to the vulgar acceptation of the term. He disdained all cant
      and clap-trap. He preached Church principles with commanding eloquence, and he practised them
      with unceasing devotion. His church was always open, yet his schools were never neglected;
      there was a perfect choir, a staff of disciplined curates, young and ascetic, while sacred
      sisters, some of patrician blood, fearless and prepared for martyrdom, were gliding about all
      the back slums of his ferocious neighbourhood. How came the Whigs to give such a church to
      such a person? There must have been some mistake. But how came it that all the Whig ladies
      were among the most devoted of his congregation? The government whips did not like it; at such
      a critical period too, when it was necessary to keep the Dissenters up to the mark! And there
      was Lady Montfort and Lady Roehampton never absent on a Sunday, and their carriages, it was
      whispered, were often suspiciously near to St. Rosicrucius on week-days. Mr. Sidney Wilton too
      was frequently in Lady Roehampton’s pew, and one day, absolutely my lord himself, who
      unfortunately was rarely seen at church—but then, as is well known, critical despatches always
      arrive on a Sunday morning—was successfully landed in her pew by Lady Roehampton, and was very
      much struck indeed by what he heard. “The fact is,” as he afterwards observed, “I wish we had
      such a fellow on our bench in the House of Commons.”</p>
     <p>About this time also there was another event, which, although not of so general an interest,
      much touched the feelings of Endymion, and this was the marriage of the Earl of Beaumaris with
      Imogene. It was solemnised in as private and quiet a manner as possible. Waldershare was the
      best man, and there were no bridesmaids. The only other persons invited by Mr. Rodney, who
      gave away the bride, were Endymion and Mr. Vigo.</p>
     <p>One morning, a few days before the wedding, Sylvia, who had written to ask Lady Roehampton
      for an interview, called by appointment in St. James’ Square. Sylvia was received by Lady
      Roehampton in her boudoir, and the interview was long. Sylvia, who by nature was composed, and
      still more so by art, was pale and nervous when she arrived, so much so that her demeanour was
      noticed by the groom of the chambers; but when she departed, her countenance was flushed and
      radiant, though it was obvious that she had been shedding tears. On the morning of the
      wedding, Lady Roehampton in her lord’s brougham called for Endymion at the Albany, and then
      they went together to the vestry of St. James’ Church. Lord Beaumaris and Mr. Waldershare had
      arrived. The bridegroom was a little embarrassed when he was presented to Lady Roehampton. He
      had made up his mind to be married, but not to be introduced to a stranger, and particularly a
      lady; but Mr. Waldershare fluttered over them and put all right. It was only the perplexity of
      a moment, for the rest of the wedding party now appeared. Imogene, who was in a travelling
      dress, was pale and serious, but transcendently beautiful. She attempted to touch Lady
      Roehampton’s hand with her lips when Myra welcomed her, but Lady Roehampton would not permit
      this, and kissed her. Everybody was calm during the ceremony except Endymion, who had been
      silent the whole morning. He stood by the altar with that convulsion of the throat and that
      sickness of the heart which accompany the sense of catastrophe. He was relieved by some tears
      which he easily concealed. Nobody noticed him, for all were thinking of themselves. After the
      ceremony, they all returned to the vestry, and Lady Roehampton with the others signed the
      registry. Lord and Lady Beaumaris instantly departed for the continent.</p>
     <p>“A strange event!” exclaimed Lady Roehampton, as she threw herself back in the brougham and
      took her brother’s hand. “But not stranger than what has happened to ourselves. Fortune seems
      to attend on our ruined home. I thought the bride looked beautiful.”</p>
     <p>Endymion was silent.</p>
     <p>“You are not gay this morning, my dear,” said Lady Roehampton; “they say that weddings are
      depressing. Now I am in rather high spirits. I am very glad that Imogene has become Lady
      Beaumaris. She is beautiful, and dangerously beautiful. Do you know, my Endymion, I have had
      some uneasy moments about this young lady. Women are prescient in these matters, and I have
      observed with anxiety that you admired her too much yourself.”</p>
     <p>“I am sure you had no reason, Myra,” said Endymion, blushing deeply.</p>
     <p>“Certainly not from what you said, my dear. It was from what you did not say that I became
      alarmed. You seldom mentioned her name, and when I referred to her, you always turned the
      conversation. However, that is all over now. She is Countess of Beaumaris,” added Myra,
      dwelling slowly and with some unction on the title, “and may be a powerful friend to you; and
      I am Countess of Roehampton, and am your friend, also not quite devoid of power. And there are
      other countesses, I suspect, on whose good wishes you may rely. If we cannot shape your
      destiny, there is no such thing as witchcraft. No, Endymion, marriage is a mighty instrument
      in your hands. It must not be lightly used. Come in and lunch; my lord is at home, and I know
      he wants to see you.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LVIII</head>
     <p>What was most remarkable, and most interesting, in the character of Berengaria was her
      energy. She had the power of exciting others to action in a degree rarely possessed. She had
      always some considerable object in contemplation, occasionally more than one, and never
      foresaw difficulties. Her character was, however, singularly feminine; she never affected to
      be a superior woman. She never reasoned, did not read much, though her literary taste was fine
      and fastidious. Though she required constant admiration and consequently encouraged it, she
      was not a heartless coquette. Her sensibility was too quick, and as the reign of her
      favourites was sometimes brief, she was looked upon as capricious. The truth is, what seemed
      whimsical in her affections was occasioned by the subtlety of her taste, which was not always
      satisfied by the increased experience of intimacy. Whenever she made a friend not unworthy of
      her, she was constant and entirely devoted.</p>
     <p>At present, Berengaria had two great objects; one was to sustain the Whig government in its
      troubles, and the other was to accomplish an unprecedented feat in modern manners, and that
      was no less than to hold a tournament, a real tournament, in the autumn, at the famous castle
      of her lord in the North of England.</p>
     <p>The lord-lieutenant had not been in his county for two years; he had even omitted to
      celebrate Christmas at his castle, which had shocked everybody, for its revelry was looked
      upon almost as the tenure by which the Montforts held their estates. His plea of ill health,
      industriously circulated by all his agents, obtained neither sympathy nor credence. His county
      was rather a weak point with Lord Montfort, for though he could not bear his home, he was fond
      of power, and power depended on his territorial influence. The representation of his county by
      his family, and authority in the local parliamentary boroughs, were the compensations held out
      to him for the abolition of his normal seats. His wife dexterously availed herself of this
      state of affairs to obtain his assent to her great project, which, it would appear, might not
      only amuse him, but, in its unprecedented magnificence and novelty, must sweep away all
      discontents, and gratify every class.</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort had placed unlimited resources at the disposal of Berengaria for the
      fulfilment of her purpose, and at times even showed some not inconsiderable though fitful
      interest in her progress. He turned over the drawings of the various costumes and armour with
      a gracious smile, and, having picked up on such subjects a great deal of knowledge,
      occasionally made suggestions which were useful and sometimes embarrassing. The heralds were
      all called into council, and Garter himself deigned to regulate the order of proceedings. Some
      of the finest gentlemen in London, of both parties in the state, passed the greater part of
      their spring mornings in jousting, and in practising all the manoeuvres of the lists. Lady
      Montfort herself was to be the Queen of the Tournament, and she had prevailed on Lady
      Roehampton to accept the supreme office of Queen of Beauty.</p>
     <p>It was the early part of May, and Zenobia held one of her great assemblies. Being in high
      good humour, sanguine and prophetic of power, she had asked all the great Whig ladies, and,
      the times being critical, they had come. Berengaria seemed absorbed by the details of her
      tournament. She met many of her knights, and she conferred with them all; the Knight of the
      Bleeding Heart, the Knight of Roses, the Knight of the Crystal Shield.</p>
     <p>Endymion, who was not to be a knight, but a gentleman-at-arms in attendance on the Queen of
      the Tournament, mentioned that Prince Florestan much wished to be a jouster; he had heard this
      from the Duke of St. Angelo, and Lady Montfort, though she did not immediately sanction, did
      not absolutely refuse, the request.</p>
     <p>Past midnight, there was a sudden stir in the saloons. The House of Commons had broken up
      and many members were entering. There had been a division on the Jamaica question, and the
      ministers had only a majority of five. The leader of the House of Commons had intimated, not
      to say announced, their consequent resignation.</p>
     <p>“Have you heard what they say?” said Endymion anxiously to Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Yes, I heard; but do not look so grave.”</p>
     <p>“Do I look grave?”</p>
     <p>“As if it were the last day.”</p>
     <p>“I fear it is.”</p>
     <p>“I am not so sure. I doubt whether Sir Robert thinks it ripe enough; and after all, we are
      not in a minority. I do not see why we should have resigned. I wish I could see Lord
      Roehampton.”</p>
     <p>Affairs did not proceed so rapidly as the triumphant Zenobia expected. They were out, no
      question about that; but it was not so certain who was in. A day passed and another day, and
      even Zenobia, who knew everything before anybody, remained in the dark. The suspense became
      protracted and even more mysterious. Almost a week had elapsed; noble lords and right
      honourable gentlemen were calling on Sir Robert every morning, according to the newspapers,
      but no one could hear from any authority of any appointments being really made. At last, there
      was a whisper very late one night at Crockford’s, which was always better informed on these
      matters than the political clubs, and people looked amazed, and stared incredulously in each
      other’s face. But it was true; there was a hitch, and in four-and-twenty hours the cause of
      the hitch was known. It seemed that the ministry really had resigned, but Berengaria, Countess
      of Montfort, had not followed their example.</p>
     <p>What a dangerous woman! even wicked! Zenobia was for sending her to the Tower at once. “It
      was clearly impossible,” she declared, “for Sir Robert to carry on affairs with such a
      Duchesse de Longueville always at the ear of our young Queen, under the pretence forsooth of
      being the friend of Her Majesty’s youth.”</p>
     <p>This was the famous Bed-Chamber Plot, in which the Conservative leaders, as is now generally
      admitted, were decidedly in error, and which terminated in the return of the Whigs to
      office.</p>
     <p>“But we must reconstruct,” said Lady Montfort to the prime minister. “Sidney Wilton must be
      Secretary of State. And you,” she said to Endymion, when she communicated to him the
      successful result of her interference, “you will go with him. It is a great thing at your age
      to be private secretary to a Secretary of State.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LIX</head>
     <p>Montfort Castle was the stronghold of England against the Scotch invader. It stood on a high
      and vast table-land, with the town of Montfort on one side at its feet, and on the other a
      wide-spreading and sylvan domain, herded with deer of various races, and terminating in pine
      forests; beyond them moors and mountains. The donjon keep, tall and grey, that had arrested
      the Douglas, still remained intact, and many an ancient battlement; but the long list of the
      Lords of Montfort had successively added to the great structure according to the genius of the
      times, so that still with the external appearance generally of a feudal castle, it combined in
      its various courts and quadrangle all the splendour and convenience of a modern palace.</p>
     <p>But though it had witnessed many scenes and sights, and as strange ones as any old walls in
      this ancient land, it may be doubted whether the keep of Montfort ever looked down on anything
      more rare than the life that was gathering and disporting itself in its towers and halls, and
      courts and parks, and forest chase, in the memorable autumn of this year.</p>
     <p>Berengaria had repaired to her castle full of triumph; her lord, in high good humour,
      admiring his wife for her energy, yet with a playful malice apparently enjoying the
      opportunity of showing that the chronology of her arrangements was confused, and her costume
      incorrect. They had good-naturedly taken Endymion down with them; for travelling to the Border
      in those times was a serious affair for a clerk in a public office. Day after day the other
      guests arrived; the rivals in the tourney were among the earliest, for they had to make
      themselves acquainted with the land which was to be the scene of their exploits. There came
      the Knights of the Griffin, and the Dragon, and the Black Lion and the Golden Lion, and the
      Dolphin and the Stag’s Head, and they were all always scrupulously addressed by their
      chivalric names, instead of by the Tommys and the Jemmys that circulated in the affectionate
      circle of White’s, or the Gusseys and the Regys of Belgravian tea-parties. After a time duly
      appeared the Knight of the White Rose, whose armour shielded the princely form of Florestan;
      and this portion of the company was complete when the Black Knight at length reached the
      castle, who had been detained by his attendance on a conference at St. James’, in the
      character of the Count of Ferroll.</p>
     <p>If anything could add to the delight and excitement of Berengaria, it would seem to be the
      arrival of the Count of Ferroll.</p>
     <p>Other guests gradually appeared, who were to sustain other characters in the great pageant.
      There was the Judge of Peace, and the Knight Marshal of the Lists, and the Jester, who was to
      ride on a caparisoned mule trapped with bells, and himself bearing a sceptre. Mr. Sidney
      Wilton came down, who had promised to be King of the Tournament; and, though rather late, for
      my lord had been detained by the same cause as the Count of Ferroll, at length arrived the
      Queen of Beauty herself.</p>
     <p>If the performance, to which all contiguous Britain intended to repair—for irrespective of
      the railroads, which now began sensibly to affect the communications in the North of England,
      steamers were chartering from every port for passengers to the Montfort tournament within one
      hundred miles’ distance—were equal to the preparation, the affair must be a great success. The
      grounds round the castle seemed to be filled every day with groups of busy persons in fanciful
      costume, all practising their duties and rehearsing their parts; swordsmen and bowmen, and
      seneschals and esquires, and grooms and pages, and heralds in tabards, and pursuivants, and
      banner-bearers. The splendid pavilions of the knights were now completed, and the gorgeous
      throne of the Queen of Beauty, surrounded by crimson galleries, tier above tier, for thousands
      of favoured guests, were receiving only their last stroke of magnificence. The mornings passed
      in a feverish whirl of curiosity, and preparation, and excitement, and some anxiety. Then
      succeeded the banquet, where nearly one hundred guests were every day present; but the company
      were so absorbed in the impending event that none expected or required, in the evenings, any
      of the usual schemes or sources of amusement that abound in country houses. Comments on the
      morning, and plans for the morrow, engrossed all thought and conversation, and my lord’s band
      was just a due accompaniment that filled the pauses when perplexities arrested talk, or deftly
      blended with some whispered phrase almost as sweet or thrilling as the notes of the
      cornet-a-piston.</p>
     <p>“I owe my knighthood to you,” said Prince Florestan to Lady Roehampton, “as I do everything
      in this country that is agreeable.”</p>
     <p>“You cannot be my knight,” replied Lady Roehampton, “because I am told I am the sovereign of
      all the chivalry, but you have my best wishes.”</p>
     <p>“All that I want in life,” said the prince, “are your good wishes.”</p>
     <p>“I fear they are barren.”</p>
     <p>“No, they are inspiring,” said the prince with unusual feeling. “You brought me good
      fortune. From the moment I saw you, light fell upon my life.”</p>
     <p>“Is not that an exaggerated phrase?” said Lady Roehampton with a smile, “because I happened
      to get you a ticket for a masquerade.”</p>
     <p>“I was thinking of something else,” said the prince pensively; “but life is a masquerade; at
      least mine has been.”</p>
     <p>“I think yours, sir, is a most interesting life,” said Lady Roehampton, “and, were I you, I
      would not quarrel with my destiny.”</p>
     <p>“My destiny is not fulfilled,” said the prince. “I have never quarrelled with it, and am
      least disposed to do so at this moment.”</p>
     <p>“Mr. Sidney Wilton was speaking to me very much the other day about your royal mother, sir,
      Queen Agrippina. She must have been fascinating.”</p>
     <p>“I like fascinating women,” said the prince, “but they are rare.”</p>
     <p>“Perhaps it is better it should be so,” said Lady Roehampton, “for they are apt—are they
      not?—to disturb the world.”</p>
     <p>“I confess I like to be bewitched,” said the prince, “and I do not care how much the world
      is disturbed.”</p>
     <p>“But is not the world very well as it is?” said Lady Roehampton. “Why should we not be happy
      and enjoy it?”</p>
     <p>“I do enjoy it,” replied Prince Florestan, “especially at Montfort Castle; I suppose there
      is something in the air that agrees with one. But enjoyment of the present is consistent with
      objects for the future.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! now you are thinking of your great affairs—of your kingdom. My woman’s brain is not
      equal to that.”</p>
     <p>“I think your brain is quite equal to kingdoms,” said the prince, with a serious expression,
      and speaking in even a lower voice, “but I was not thinking of my kingdom. I leave that to
      fate; I believe it is destined to be mine, and therefore occasions me thought but not anxiety.
      I was thinking of something else than kingdoms, and of which unhappily I am not so certain—of
      which I am most uncertain—of which I fear I have no chance—and yet which is dearer to me than
      even my crown.”</p>
     <p>“What can that be?” said Lady Roehampton, with unaffected wonderment.</p>
     <p>“‘Tis a secret of chivalry,” said Prince Florestan, “and I must never disclose it.”</p>
     <p>“It is a wonderful scene,” said Adriana Neuchatel to Endymion, who had been for some time
      conversing with her. “I had no idea that I should be so much amused by anything in society.
      But then, it is so unlike anything one has ever seen.”</p>
     <p>Mrs. Neuchatel had not accompanied her husband and her daughter to the Montfort Tournament.
      Mr. Neuchatel required a long holiday, and after the tournament he was to take Adriana to
      Scotland. Mrs. Neuchatel shut herself up at Hainault, which it seemed she had never enjoyed
      before. She could hardly believe it was the same place, freed from its daily invasions by the
      House of Commons and the Stock Exchange. She had never lived so long without seeing an
      ambassador or a cabinet minister, and it was quite a relief. She wandered in the gardens, and
      drove her pony-chair in forest glades. She missed Adriana very much, and for a few days always
      expected her to enter the room when the door opened; and then she sighed, and then she flew to
      her easel, or buried herself in some sublime cantata of her favourite master, Beethoven. Then
      came the most wonderful performance of the whole day, and that was the letter, never missed,
      to Adriana. Considering that she lived in solitude, and in a spot with which her daughter was
      quite familiar, it was really marvellous that the mother should every day be able to fill so
      many interesting and impassioned pages. But Mrs. Neuchatel was a fine penwoman; her feelings
      were her facts, and her ingenious observations of art and nature were her news. After the
      first fever of separation, reading was always a resource to her, for she was a great student.
      She was surrounded by all the literary journals and choice publications of Europe, and there
      scarcely was a branch of science and learning with which she was not sufficiently familiar to
      be able to comprehend the stir and progress of the European mind. Mrs. Neuchatel had contrived
      to get rid of the chief cook by sending him on a visit to Paris, so she could, without cavil,
      dine off a cutlet and seltzer-water in her boudoir. Sometimes, not merely for distraction, but
      more from a sense of duty, she gave festivals to her schools; and when she had lived like a
      princely prisoner of state alone for a month, or rather like one on a desert isle who sighs to
      see a sail, she would ask a great geologist and his wife to pay her a visit, or some
      professor, who, though himself not worth a shilling, had some new plans, which really sounded
      quite practical, for the more equal distribution of wealth.</p>
     <p>“And who is your knight?” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>Adriana looked distressed.</p>
     <p>“I mean, whom do you wish to win?”</p>
     <p>“Oh, I should like them all to win!”</p>
     <p>“That is good-natured, but then there would be no distinction. I know who is going to wear
      your colours—the Knight of the Dolphin.”</p>
     <p>“I hope nothing of that kind will happen,” said Adriana, agitated. “I know that some of the
      knights are going to wear ladies’ colours, but I trust no one will think of wearing mine. I
      know the Black Knight wears Lady Montfort’s.”</p>
     <p>“He cannot,” said Endymion hastily. “She is first lady to the Queen of Beauty; no knight can
      wear the colours of the Queen. I asked Sir Morte d’Arthur himself, and he told me there was no
      doubt about it, and that he had consulted Garter before he came down.”</p>
     <p>“Well, all I know is that the Count of Ferroll told me so,” said Adriana; “I sate next to
      him at dinner.”</p>
     <p>“He shall not wear her colours,” said Endymion quite angrily. “I will speak to the King of
      the Tournament about it directly.”</p>
     <p>“Why, what does it signify?” said Adriana.</p>
     <p>“You thought it signified when I told you Regy Sutton was going to wear your colours.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! that is quite a different business,” said Adriana, with a sigh.</p>
     <p>Reginald Sutton was a professed admirer of Adriana, rode with her whenever he could, and
      danced with her immensely. She gave him cold encouragement, though he was the best-looking and
      best-dressed youth in England; but he was a determined young hero, not gifted with too
      sensitive nerves, and was a votary of the great theory that all in life was an affair of will,
      and that endowed with sufficient energy he might marry whom he liked. He accounted for his
      slow advance in London by the inimical presence of Mrs. Neuchatel, who he felt, or fancied,
      did not sympathise with him; while, on the contrary, he got on very well with the father, and
      so he was determined to seize the present opportunity. The mother was absent, and he himself
      in a commanding position, being one of the knights to whose exploits the eyes of all England
      were attracted.</p>
     <p>Lord Roehampton was seated between an ambassadress and Berengaria, indulging in gentle and
      sweet-voiced raillery; the Count of Ferroll was standing beside Lady Montfort, and Mr. Wilton
      was opposite to the group. The Count of Ferroll rarely spoke, but listened to Lady Montfort
      with what she called one of his dark smiles.</p>
     <p>“All I know is, she will never pardon you for not asking her,” said Lord Roehampton. “I saw
      Bicester the day I left town, and he was very grumpy. He said that Lady Bicester was the only
      person who understood tournaments. She had studied the subject.”</p>
     <p>“I suppose she wanted to be the Queen of Beauty,” said Berengaria.</p>
     <p>“You are too severe, my dear lady. I think she would have been contented with a knight
      wearing her colours.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I cannot help it,” said Berengaria, but somewhat doubtingly. And then, after a
      moment’s pause, “She is too ugly.”</p>
     <p>“Why, she came to my fancy ball, and it is not five years ago, as Mary Queen of Scots!”</p>
     <p>“That must have been after the Queen’s decapitation,” said Berengaria.</p>
     <p>“I wonder you did not ask Zenobia,” said Mr. Wilton.</p>
     <p>“Of course I asked her, but I knew she would not come. She is in one of her hatreds now. She
      said she would have come, only she had half-promised to give a ball to the tenants at
      Merrington about that time, and she did not like to disappoint them. Quite touching, was it
      not?”</p>
     <p>“A touch beyond the reach of art,” said Mr. Wilton; “almost worthy of yourself, Lady
      Montfort.”</p>
     <p>“And what do you think of all this?” asked Lord Montfort of Nigel Penruddock, who, in a
      cassock that swept the ground, had been stalking about the glittering salons like a prophet
      who had been ordained in Mayfair, but who had now seated himself by his host.</p>
     <p>“I am thinking of what is beneath all this,” replied Nigel. “A great revivication. Chivalry
      is the child of the Church; it is the distinctive feature of Christian Europe. Had it not been
      for the revival of Church principles, this glorious pageant would never have occurred. But it
      is a pageant only to the uninitiated. There is not a ceremony, a form, a phrase, a costume,
      which is not symbolic of a great truth or a high purpose.”</p>
     <p>“I do not think Lady Montfort is aware of all this,” said her lord.</p>
     <p>“Oh yes!” said Nigel. “Lady Montfort is a great woman—a woman who could inspire crusades and
      create churches. She might, and she will, I trust, rank with the Helenas and the
      Matildas.”</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort gave a little sound, but so gentle that it was heard probably but by himself,
      which in common language would be styled a whistle—an articulate modulation of the breath
      which in this instance expressed a sly sentiment of humorous amazement.</p>
     <p>“Well, Mr. Ferrars,” said Mr. Neuchatel, with a laughing eye, to that young gentleman, as he
      encountered Endymion passing by, “and how are you getting on? Are we to see you to-morrow in a
      Milanese suit?”</p>
     <p>“I am only a page,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Well, well, the old Italian saying is, ‘A page beats a knight,’ at least with the
      ladies.”</p>
     <p>“Do you not think it very absurd,” said Endymion, “that the Count of Ferroll says he shall
      wear Lady Montfort’s colours? Lady Montfort is only the first lady of the Queen of Beauty, and
      she can wear no colours except the Queen’s. Do not you think somebody ought to interfere?”</p>
     <p>“Hem! The Count of Ferroll is a man who seldom makes a mistake,” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“So everybody says,” said Endymion rather testily; “but I do not see that.”</p>
     <p>“Now, you are a very young man,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “and I hope you will some day be a
      statesman. I do not see why you should not, if you are industrious and stick to your master,
      for Mr. Sidney Wilton is a man who will always rise; but, if I were you, I would keep my eyes
      very much on the Count of Ferroll, for, depend on it, he is one of those men who sooner or
      later will make a noise in the world.”</p>
     <p>Adriana came up at this moment, leaning on the arm of the Knight of the Dolphin, better
      known as Regy Sutton. They came from the tea-room. Endymion moved away with a cloud on his
      brow, murmuring to himself, “I am quite sick of the name of the Count of Ferroll.”</p>
     <p>The jousting-ground was about a mile from the castle, and though it was nearly encircled by
      vast and lofty galleries, it was impossible that accommodation could be afforded on this spot
      to the thousands who had repaired from many parts of the kingdom to the Montfort Tournament.
      But even a hundred thousand people could witness the procession from the castle to the scene
      of action. That was superb. The sun shone, and not one of the breathless multitude was
      disappointed.</p>
     <p>There came a long line of men-at-arms and musicians and trumpeters and banner-bearers of the
      Lord of the Tournament, and heralds in tabards, and pursuivants, and then the Herald of the
      Tournament by himself, whom the people at first mistook for the Lord Mayor.</p>
     <p>Then came the Knight Marshal on a caparisoned steed, himself in a suit of gilt armour, and
      in a richly embroidered surcoat. A band of halberdiers preceded the King of the Tournament,
      also on a steed richly caparisoned, and himself clad in robes of velvet and ermine, and
      wearing a golden crown.</p>
     <p>Then on a barded Arab, herself dressed in cloth of gold, parti-coloured with violet and
      crimson, came, amidst tremendous cheering, the Queen of Beauty herself. Twelve attendants bore
      aloft a silken canopy, which did not conceal from the enraptured multitude the lustre of her
      matchless loveliness. Lady Montfort, Adriana, and four other attendant ladies, followed her
      majesty, two by two, each in gorgeous attire, and on a charger that vied in splendour with its
      mistress. Six pages followed next, in violet and silver.</p>
     <p>The bells of a barded mule announced the Jester, who waved his sceptre with unceasing
      authority, and pelted the people with admirably prepared impromptus. Some in the crowd tried
      to enter into a competition of banter, but they were always vanquished.</p>
     <p>Soon a large army of men-at-arms and the sounds of most triumphant music stopped the general
      laughter, and all became again hushed in curious suspense. The tallest and the stoutest of the
      Border men bore the gonfalon of the Lord of the Tournament. That should have been Lord
      Montfort himself; but he had deputed the office to his cousin and presumptive heir. Lord
      Montfort was well represented, and the people cheered his cousin Odo heartily, as in his suit
      of golden armour richly chased, and bending on his steed, caparisoned in blue and gold, he
      acknowledged their fealty with a proud reverence.</p>
     <p>The other knights followed in order, all attended by their esquires and their grooms. Each
      knight was greatly applauded, and it was really a grand sight to see them on their barded
      chargers and in their panoply; some in suits of engraved Milanese armour, some in German suits
      of fluted polished steel; some in steel armour engraved and inlaid with gold. The Black Knight
      was much cheered, but no one commanded more admiration than Prince Florestan, in a suit of
      blue damascened armour, and inlaid with silver roses.</p>
     <p>Every procession must end. It is a pity, for there is nothing so popular with mankind. The
      splendid part of the pageant had passed, but still the people gazed and looked as if they
      would have gazed for ever. The visitors at the castle, all in ancient costume, attracted much
      notice. Companies of swordsmen and bowmen followed, till at last the seneschal of the castle,
      with his chamberlains and servitors, closed the spell-bound scene.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LX</head>
     <p>The jousting was very successful; though some were necessarily discomfited, almost every one
      contrived to obtain some distinction. But the two knights who excelled and vanquished every
      one except themselves were the Black Knight and the Knight of the White Rose. Their exploits
      were equal at the close of the first day, and on the second they were to contend for the
      principal prize of the tournament, for which none else were entitled to be competitors. This
      was a golden helm, to be placed upon the victor’s brow by the Queen of Beauty.</p>
     <p>There was both a banquet and a ball on this day, and the excitement between the adventures
      of the morning and the prospects of the morrow was great. The knights, freed from their
      armour, appeared in fanciful dresses of many-coloured velvets. All who had taken part in the
      pageant retained their costumes, and the ordinary guests, if they yielded to mediaeval
      splendour, successfully asserted the taste of Paris and its sparkling grace, in their
      exquisite robes, and wreaths and garlands of fantastic loveliness.</p>
     <p>Berengaria, full of the inspiration of success, received the smiling congratulations of
      everybody, and repaid them with happy suggestions, which she poured forth with inexhaustible
      yet graceful energy. The only person who had a gloomy air was Endymion. She rallied him. “I
      shall call you the Knight of the Woeful Countenance if you approach me with such a visage.
      What can be the matter with you?”</p>
     <p>“Nothing,” repeated Endymion, looking rather away.</p>
     <p>The Knight of the Dolphin came up and said, “This is a critical affair to-morrow, my dear
      Lady Montfort. If the Count Ferroll is discomfited by the prince, it may be a <hi>casus
       belli</hi>. You ought to get Lord Roehampton to interfere and prevent the encounter.”</p>
     <p>“The Count of Ferroll will not be discomfited,” said Lady Montfort. “He is one of those men
      who never fail.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not know,” said the Knight of the Dolphin musingly. “The prince has a stout
      lance, and I have felt it.”</p>
     <p>“He had the best of it this morning,” said Endymion rather bitterly. “Every one thought so,
      and that it was very fortunate for the Count of Ferroll that the heralds closed the
      lists.”</p>
     <p>“It might have been fortunate for others,” rejoined Lady Montfort. “What is the general
      opinion?” she added, addressing the Knight of the Dolphin. “Do not go away, Mr. Ferrars. I
      want to give you some directions about to-morrow.”</p>
     <p>“I do not think I shall be at the place to-morrow,” muttered Endymion.</p>
     <p>“What!” exclaimed Berengaria; but at this moment Mr. Sidney Wilton came up and said, “I have
      been looking at the golden helm. It is entrusted to my care as King of the Tournament. It is
      really so beautiful, that I think I shall usurp it.”</p>
     <p>“You will have to settle that with the Count of Ferroll,” said Berengaria.</p>
     <p>“The betting is about equal,” said the Knight of the Dolphin.</p>
     <p>“Well, we must have some gloves upon it,” said Berengaria.</p>
     <p>Endymion walked away.</p>
     <p>He walked away, and the first persons that met his eye were the prince and the Count of
      Ferroll in conversation. It was sickening. They seemed quite gay, and occasionally examined
      together a paper which the prince held in his hand, and which was an official report by the
      heralds of the day’s jousting. This friendly conversation might apparently have gone on for
      ever had not the music ceased and the count been obliged to seek his partner for the coming
      dance.</p>
     <p>“I wonder you can speak to him,” said Endymion, going up to the prince. “If the heralds had
      not—many think, too hastily—closed the lists this morning, you would have been the victor of
      the day.”</p>
     <p>“My dear child! what can you mean?” said the prince. “I believe everything was closed quite
      properly, and as for myself, I am entirely satisfied with my share of the day’s success.”</p>
     <p>“If you had thrown him,” said Endymion, “he could not with decency have contended for the
      golden helm.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! that is what you deplore,” said the prince. “The Count of Ferroll and I shall have to
      contend for many things more precious than golden helms before we die.”</p>
     <p>“I believe he is a very overrated man,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Why?” said the prince.</p>
     <p>“I detest him,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“That is certainly a reason why <hi>you</hi> should not overrate him,” said the prince.</p>
     <p>“There seems a general conspiracy to run him up,” said Endymion with pique.</p>
     <p>“The Count of Ferroll is the man of the future,” said the prince calmly.</p>
     <p>“That is what Mr. Neuchatel said to me yesterday. I suppose he caught it from you.”</p>
     <p>“It is an advantage, a great advantage, for me to observe the Count of Ferroll in this
      intimate society,” said the prince, speaking slowly, “perhaps even to fathom him. But I am not
      come to that yet. He is a man neither to love nor to detest. He has himself an intelligence
      superior to all passion, I might say all feeling; and if, in dealing with such a being, we
      ourselves have either, we give him an advantage.”</p>
     <p>“Well, all the same, I hope you will win the golden helm to-morrow,” said Endymion, looking
      a little perplexed.</p>
     <p>“The golden casque that I am ordained to win,” said the prince, “is not at Montfort Castle.
      This, after all, is but Mambrino’s helmet.”</p>
     <p>A knot of young dandies were discussing the chances of the morrow as Endymion was passing
      by, and as he knew most of them he joined the group.</p>
     <p>“I hope to heaven,” said one, “that the Count of Ferroll will beat that foreign chap
      to-morrow; I hate foreigners.”</p>
     <p>“So do I,” said a second, and there was a general murmur of assent.</p>
     <p>“The Count of Ferroll is as much a foreigner as the prince,” said Endymion rather
      sharply.</p>
     <p>“Oh! I don’t call him a foreigner at all,” said the first speaker. “He is a great favourite
      at White’s; no one rides cross country like him, and he is a deuced fine shot in the
      bargain.”</p>
     <p>“I will back Prince Florestan against him either in field or cover,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Well, I don’t know your friend,” said the young gentleman contemptuously, “so I cannot
      bet.”</p>
     <p>“I am sure your friend, Lady Montfort, my dear Dymy, will back the Count of Ferroll,” lisped
      a third young gentleman.</p>
     <p>This completed the programme of mortification, and Endymion, hot and then cold, and then
      both at the same time, bereft of repartee, and wishing the earth would open and Montfort
      Castle disappear in its convulsed bosom, stole silently away as soon as practicable, and
      wandered as far as possible from the music and the bursts of revelry.</p>
     <p>These conversations had taken place in the chief saloon, which was contiguous to the
      ball-room, and which was nearly as full of guests. Endymion, moving in the opposite direction,
      entered another drawing-room, where the population was sparse. It consisted of couples
      apparently deeply interested in each other. Some faces were radiant, and some pensive and a
      little agitated, but they all agreed in one expression, that they took no interest whatever in
      the solitary Endymion. Even their whispered words were hushed as he passed by, and they
      seemed, with their stony, unsympathising glance, to look upon him as upon some inferior being
      who had intruded into their paradise. In short, Endymion felt all that embarrassment, mingled
      with a certain portion of self contempt, which attends the conviction that we are what is
      delicately called <hi>de trop</hi>.</p>
     <p>He advanced and took refuge in another room, where there was only a single, and still more
      engrossed pair; but this was even more intolerable to him. Shrinking from a return to the
      hostile chamber he had just left, he made a frantic rush forward with affected ease and
      alacrity, and found himself alone in the favourite morning room of Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>He threw himself on a sofa, and hid his face in his hand, and gave a sigh, which was almost
      a groan. He was sick at heart; his extremities were cold, his brain was feeble. All hope, and
      truly all thought of the future, deserted him. He remembered only the sorrowful, or the
      humiliating, chapters in his life. He wished he had never left Hurstley. He wished he had been
      apprenticed to Farmer Thornberry, that he had never quitted his desk at Somerset House, and
      never known more of life than Joe’s and the Divan. All was vanity and vexation of spirit. He
      contemplated finishing his days in the neighbouring stream, in which, but a few days ago, he
      was bathing in health and joy.</p>
     <p>Time flew on; he was unconscious of its course; no one entered the room, and he wished never
      to see a human face again, when a voice sounded, and he heard his name.</p>
     <p>“Endymion!”</p>
     <p>He looked up; it was Lady Montfort. He did not speak, but gave her, perhaps unconsciously, a
      glance of reproach and despair.</p>
     <p>“What is the matter with you?” she said.</p>
     <p>“Nothing.”</p>
     <p>“That is nonsense. Something must have happened. I have missed you so long, but was
      determined to find you. Have you a headache?”</p>
     <p>“No.”</p>
     <p>“Come back; come back with me. It is so odd. My lord has asked for you twice.”</p>
     <p>“I want to see no one.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! but this is absurd—and on a day like this, when every thing has been so successful, and
      every one is so happy.”</p>
     <p>“I am not happy, and I am not successful.”</p>
     <p>“You perfectly astonish me,” said Lady Montfort; “I shall begin to believe that you have not
      so sweet a temper as I always supposed.”</p>
     <p>“It matters not what my temper is.”</p>
     <p>“I think it matters a great deal. I like, above all things, to live with good-tempered
      people.”</p>
     <p>“I hope you may not be disappointed. My temper is my own affair, and I am content always to
      be alone.”</p>
     <p>“Why! you are talking nonsense, Endymion.”</p>
     <p>“Probably; I do not pretend to be gifted. I am not one of those gentlemen who cannot fail. I
      am not the man of the future.”</p>
     <p>“Well! I never was so surprised in my life,” exclaimed Lady Montfort. “I never will pretend
      to form an opinion of human character again. Now, my dear Endymion, rouse yourself, and come
      back with me. Give me your arm. I cannot stay another moment; I dare say I have already been
      wanted a thousand times.”</p>
     <p>“I cannot go back,” said Endymion; “I never wish to see anybody again. If you want an arm,
      there is the Count of Ferroll, and I hope you may find he has a sweeter temper than I
      have.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort looked at him with a strange and startled glance. It was a mixture of
      surprise, a little disdain, some affection blended with mockery. And then exclaiming “Silly
      boy!” she swept out of the room.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXI</head>
     <p>“I do not like the prospect of affairs,” said Mr. Sidney Wilton to Endymion as they were
      posting up to London from Montfort Castle; a long journey, but softened in those days by many
      luxuries, and they had much to talk about.</p>
     <p>“The decline of the revenue is not fitful; it is regular. Our people are too apt to look at
      the state of the revenue merely in a financial point of view. If a surplus, take off taxes; if
      a deficiency, put them on. But the state of the revenue should also be considered as the index
      of the condition of the population. According to my impression, the condition of the people is
      declining; and why? because they are less employed. If this spreads, they will become
      discontented and disaffected, and I cannot help remembering that, if they become troublesome,
      it is our office that will have to deal with them.”</p>
     <p>“This bad harvest is a great misfortune,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Yes, but a bad harvest, though unquestionably a great, perhaps the greatest, misfortune for
      this country, is not the entire solution of our difficulties—I would say, our coming
      difficulties. A bad harvest touches the whole of our commercial system: it brings us face to
      face with the corn laws. I wish our chief would give his mind to that subject. I believe a
      moderate fixed duty of about twelve shillings a quarter would satisfy every one, and nothing
      then could shake this country.”</p>
     <p>Endymion listened with interest to other views of his master, who descanted on them at much
      length. Private secretaries know everything about their chiefs, and Endymion was not ignorant
      that among many of the great houses of the Whig party, and indeed among the bulk of what was
      called “the Liberal” party generally, Mr. Sidney Wilton was looked upon, so far as economical
      questions were concerned, as very crotchety, indeed a dangerous character. Lord Montfort was
      the only magnate who was entirely opposed to the corn laws, but then, as Berengaria would
      remark, “Simon is against all laws; he is not a practical man.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Sidney Wilton reverted to these views more than once in the course of their journey. “I
      was not alarmed about the Chartists last year. Political trouble in this country never
      frightens me. Insurrections and riots strengthen an English government; they gave a new lease
      even to Lord Liverpool when his ministry was most feeble and unpopular; but economical
      discontent is quite another thing. The moment sedition arises from taxation, or want of
      employment, it is more dangerous and more difficult to deal with in this country than any
      other.”</p>
     <p>“Lord Roehampton seemed to take rather a sanguine view of the situation after the
      Bed-Chamber business in the spring,” observed Endymion, rather in an inquiring than a dogmatic
      spirit.</p>
     <p>“Lord Roehampton has other things to think of,” said Mr. Wilton. “He is absorbed, and
      naturally absorbed, in his department, the most important in the state, and of which he is
      master. But I am obliged to look at affairs nearer home. Now, this Anti-Corn-Law League, which
      they established last year at Manchester, and which begins to be very busy, though nobody at
      present talks of it, is, in my mind, a movement which ought to be watched. I tell you what; it
      occurred to me more than once during that wondrous pageant, that we have just now been taking
      part in, the government wants better information than they have as to the state of the
      country, the real feelings and condition of the bulk of the population. We used to sneer at
      the Tories for their ignorance of these matters, but after all, we, like them, are mainly
      dependent on quarter sessions; on the judgment of a lord-lieutenant and the statistics of a
      bench of magistrates. It is true we have introduced into our subordinate administration at
      Whitehall some persons who have obtained the reputation of distinguished economists, and we
      allow them to guide us. But though ingenious men, no doubt, they are chiefly bankrupt
      tradesmen, who, not having been able to manage their own affairs, have taken upon themselves
      to advise on the conduct of the country—pedants and prigs at the best, and sometimes
      impostors. No; this won’t do. It is useless to speak to the chief; I did about the
      Anti-Corn-Law League; he shrugged his shoulders and said it was a madness that would pass. I
      have made up my mind to send somebody, quite privately, to the great scenes of national
      labour. He must be somebody whom nobody knows, and nobody suspects of being connected with the
      administration, or we shall never get the truth—and the person I have fixed upon is
      yourself.”</p>
     <p>“But am I equal to such a task?” said Endymion modestly, but sincerely.</p>
     <p>“I think so,” said Mr. Wilton, “or, of course, I would not have fixed upon you. I want a
      fresh and virgin intelligence to observe and consider the country. It must be a mind free from
      prejudice, yet fairly informed on the great questions involved in the wealth of nations. I
      know you have read Adam Smith, and not lightly. Well, he is the best guide, though of course
      we must adapt his principles to the circumstances with which we have to deal. You have good
      judgment, great industry, a fairly quick perception, little passion—perhaps hardly enough; but
      that is probably the consequence of the sorrows and troubles of early life. But, after all,
      there is no education like adversity.”</p>
     <p>“If it will only cease at the right time,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Well, in that respect, I do not think you have anything to complain of,” said Mr. Wilton.
      “The world is all before you, and I mistake if you do not rise. Perseverance and tact are the
      two qualities most valuable for all men who would mount, but especially for those who have to
      step out of the crowd. I am sure no one can say you are not assiduous, but I am glad always to
      observe that you have tact. Without tact you can learn nothing. Tact teaches you when to be
      silent. Inquirers who are always inquiring never learn anything.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER LXII</head>
     <p>Lancashire was not so wonderful a place forty years ago as it is at present, but, compared
      then with the rest of England, it was infinitely more striking. For a youth like Endymion,
      born and bred in our southern counties, the Berkshire downs varied by the bustle of Pall-Mall
      and the Strand—Lancashire, with its teeming and toiling cities, its colossal manufactories and
      its gigantic chimneys, its roaring engines and its flaming furnaces, its tramroads and its
      railroads, its coal and its cotton, offered a far greater contrast to the scenes in which he
      had hitherto lived, than could be furnished by almost any country of the European
      continent.</p>
     <p>Endymion felt it was rather a crisis in his life, and that his future might much depend on
      the fulfilment of the confidential office which had been entrusted to him by his chief. He
      summoned all his energies, concentrated his intelligence on the one subject, and devoted to
      its study and comprehension every moment of his thought and time. After a while, he had made
      Manchester his head-quarters. It was even then the centre of a network of railways, and gave
      him an easy command of the contiguous districts.</p>
     <p>Endymion had more than once inquired after the Anti-Corn-Law League, but had not as yet been
      so fortunate as to attend any of their meetings. They were rarer than they afterwards soon
      became, and the great manufacturers did not encourage them. “I do not like extreme views,”
      said one of the most eminent one day to Endymion. “In my opinion, we should always avoid
      extremes;” and he paused and looked around, as if he had enunciated a heaven-born truth, and
      for the first time. “I am a Liberal; so we all are here. I supported Lord Grey, and I support
      Lord Melbourne, and I am, in everything, for a liberal policy. I don’t like extremes. A wise
      minister should take off the duty on cotton wool. That is what the country really wants, and
      then everybody would be satisfied. No; I know nothing about this League you ask about, and I
      do not know any one—that is to say, any one respectable—who does. They came to me to lend my
      name. ‘No,’ I said, ‘gentlemen; I feel much honoured, but I do not like extremes;’ and they
      went away. They are making a little more noise now, because they have got a man who has the
      gift of the gab, and the people like to go and hear him speak. But as I said to a friend of
      mine, who seemed half inclined to join them, ‘Well; if I did anything of that sort, I would be
      led by a Lancashire lad. They have got a foreigner to lead them, a fellow out of Berkshire; an
      agitator—and only a print-work after all. No; that will never do.’”</p>
     <p>Notwithstanding these views, which Endymion found very generally entertained by the new
      world in which he mixed, he resolved to take the earliest opportunity of attending the meeting
      of the League, and it soon arrived.</p>
     <p>It was an evening meeting, so that workmen—or the operatives, as they were styled in this
      part of the kingdom—should be able to attend. The assembly took place in a large but temporary
      building; very well adapted to the human voice, and able to contain even thousands. It was
      fairly full to-night; and the platform, on which those who took a part in the proceedings, or
      who, by their comparatively influential presence, it was supposed, might assist the cause, was
      almost crowded.</p>
     <p>“He is going to speak to-night,” said an operative to Endymion. “That is why there is such
      an attendance.”</p>
     <p>Remembering Mr. Wilton’s hint about not asking unnecessary questions which often arrest
      information, Endymion did not inquire who “he” was; and to promote communication merely
      observed, “A fine speaker, then, I conclude?”</p>
     <p>“Well, he is in a way,” said the operative. “He has not got Hollaballoo’s voice, but he
      knows what he is talking about. I doubt their getting what they are after; they have not the
      working classes with them. If they went against truck, it would be something.”</p>
     <p>The chairman opened the proceedings; but was coldly received, though he spoke sensibly and
      at some length. He then introduced a gentleman, who was absolutely an alderman, to move a
      resolution condemnatory of the corn laws. The august position of the speaker atoned for his
      halting rhetoric, and a city which had only just for the first time been invested with
      municipal privileges was hushed before a man who might in time even become a mayor.</p>
     <p>Then the seconder advanced, and there was a general burst of applause.</p>
     <p>“There he is,” said the operative to Endymion; “you see they like him. Oh, Job knows how to
      do it!”</p>
     <p>Endymion listened with interest, soon with delight, soon with a feeling of exciting and not
      unpleasing perplexity, to the orator; for he was an orator, though then unrecognised, and
      known only in his district. He was a pale and slender man, with a fine brow and an eye that
      occasionally flashed with the fire of a creative mind. His voice certainly was not like
      Hollaballoo’s. It was rather thin, but singularly clear. There was nothing clearer except his
      meaning. Endymion never heard a case stated with such pellucid art; facts marshalled with such
      vivid simplicity, and inferences so natural and spontaneous and irresistible, that they
      seemed, as it were, borrowed from his audience, though none of that audience had arrived at
      them before. The meeting was hushed, was rapt in intellectual delight, for they did not give
      the speaker the enthusiasm of their sympathy. That was not shared, perhaps, by the moiety of
      those who listened to him. When his case was fairly before them, the speaker dealt with his
      opponents—some in the press, some in parliament—with much power of sarcasm, but this power was
      evidently rather repressed than allowed to run riot. What impressed Endymion as the chief
      quality of this remarkable speaker was his persuasiveness, and he had the air of being too
      prudent to offend even an opponent unnecessarily. His language, though natural and easy, was
      choice and refined. He was evidently a man who had read, and not a little; and there was no
      taint of vulgarity, scarcely a provincialism, in his pronunciation.</p>
     <p>He spoke for rather more than an hour; and frequently during this time, Endymion,
      notwithstanding his keen interest in what was taking place, was troubled, it might be
      disturbed, by pictures and memories of the past that he endeavoured in vain to drive away.
      When the orator concluded, amid cheering much louder than that which had first greeted him,
      Endymion, in a rather agitated voice, whispered to his neighbour, “Tell me—is his name
      Thornberry?”</p>
     <p>“That is your time of day,” said the operative. “Job Thornberry is his name, and I am on his
      works.”</p>
     <p>“And yet you do not agree with him?”</p>
     <p>“Well; I go as far as he goes, but he does not go so far as I go; that’s it.”</p>
     <p>“I do not see how a man can go much farther,” said Endymion. “Where are his works? I knew
      your master when he was in the south of England, and I should like to call on him.”</p>
     <p>“My employer,” said the operative. “They call themselves masters, but we do not. I will tell
      you. His works are a mile out of town; but it seems only a step, for there are houses all the
      way. Job Thornberry &amp; Co.‘s Print-works, Pendleton Road—any one can guide you—and when you
      get there, you can ask for me, if you like. I am his overlooker, and my name is ENOCH
      CRAGGS.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXIII</head>
     <p>“You are not much altered,” said Thornberry, as he retained Endymion’s hand, and he looked
      at him earnestly; “and yet you have become a man. I suppose I am ten years your senior. I have
      never been back to the old place, and yet I sometimes think I should like to be buried there.
      The old man has been here, and more than once, and liked it well enough; at least, I hope so.
      He told me a good deal about you all; some sorrows, and, I hope, some joys. I heard of Miss
      Myra’s marriage; she was a sweet young lady; the gravest person I ever knew; I never knew her
      smile. I remember they thought her proud, but I always had a fancy for her. Well; she has
      married a topsawyer—I believe the ablest of them all, and probably the most unprincipled;
      though I ought not to say that to you. However, public men are spoken freely of. I wish to
      Heaven you would get him to leave off tinkering those commercial treaties that he is always
      making such a fuss about. More pernicious nonsense was never devised by man than treaties of
      commerce. However, their precious most favoured nation clause will break down the whole
      concern yet. But you wish to see the works; I will show them to you myself. There is not much
      going on now, and the stagnation increases daily. And then, if you are willing, we will go
      home and have a bit of lunch—I live hard by. My best works are my wife and children: I have
      made that joke before, as you can well fancy.”</p>
     <p>This was the greeting, sincere but not unkind, of Job Thornberry to Endymion on the day
      after the meeting of the Anti-Corn-Law League. To Endymion it was an interesting, and, as he
      believed it would prove, a useful encounter.</p>
     <p>The print-works were among the most considerable of their kind at Manchester, but they were
      working now with reduced numbers and at half-time. It was the energy and the taste and
      invention of Thornberry that had given them their reputation, and secured them extensive
      markets. He had worked with borrowed capital, but had paid off his debt, and his establishment
      was now his own; but, stimulated by his success, he had made a consignment of large amount to
      the United States, where it arrived only to be welcomed by what was called the American
      crash.</p>
     <p>Turning from the high road, a walk of half a mile brought them to a little world of villas;
      varying in style and size, but all pretty, and each in its garden. “And this is my home,” said
      Thornberry, opening the wicket, “and here is my mistress and the young folks”—pointing to a
      pretty woman, but with an expression of no inconsiderable self-confidence, and with several
      children clinging to her dress and hiding their faces at the unexpected sight of a stranger.
      “My eldest is a boy, but he is at school,” said Thornberry. “I have named him, after one of
      the greatest men that ever lived, John Hampden.”</p>
     <p>“He was a landed proprietor,” observed Endymion rather drily; “and a considerable one.”</p>
     <p>“I have brought an old friend to take cheer with us,” continued Thornberry; “one whom I knew
      before any here present; so show your faces, little people;” and he caught up one of the
      children, a fair child like its mother, long-haired and blushing like a Worcestershire orchard
      before harvest time. “Tell the gentleman what you are.”</p>
     <p>“A free-trader,” murmured the infant.</p>
     <p>Within the house were several shelves of books well selected, and the walls were adorned
      with capital prints of famous works of art. “They are chiefly what are called books of
      reference,” said Thornberry, as Endymion was noticing his volumes; “but I have not much room,
      and, to tell you the truth, they are not merely books of reference to me—I like reading
      encyclopaedia. The ‘Dictionary of Dates’ is a favourite book of mine. The mind sometimes wants
      tone, and then I read Milton. He is the only poet I read—he is complete, and is enough. I have
      got his prose works too. Milton was the greatest of Englishmen.”</p>
     <p>The repast was simple, but plenteous, and nothing could be neater than the manner in which
      it was served.</p>
     <p>“We are teetotallers,” said Thornberry; “but we can give you a good cup of coffee.”</p>
     <p>“I am a teetotaller too at this time of the day,” said Endymion; “but a good cup of coffee
      is, they say, the most delicious and the rarest beverage in the world.”</p>
     <p>“Well,” continued Thornberry; “it is a long time since we met, Mr. Ferrars—ten years. I used
      to think that in ten years one might do anything; and a year ago, I really thought I had done
      it; but the accursed laws of this blessed country, as it calls itself, have nearly broken me,
      as they have broken many a better man before me.”</p>
     <p>“I am sorry to hear this,” said Endymion; “I trust it is but a passing cloud.”</p>
     <p>“It is not a cloud,” said Thornberry; “it is a storm, a tempest, a wreck—but not only for
      me. Your great relative, my Lord Roehampton, must look to it, I can tell you that. What is
      happening in this country, and is about to happen, will not be cured or averted by commercial
      treaties—mark my words.”</p>
     <p>“But what would cure it?” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“There is only one thing that can cure this country, and it will soon be too late for that.
      We must have free exchange.”</p>
     <p>“Free exchange!” murmured Endymion thoughtfully.</p>
     <p>“Why, look at this,” said Thornberry. “I had been driving a capital trade with the States
      for nearly five years. I began with nothing, as you know. I had paid off all my borrowed
      capital; my works were my own, and this house is a freehold. A year ago I sent to my
      correspondent at New York the largest consignment of goods I had ever made and the best, and I
      cannot get the slightest return for them. My correspondent writes to me that there is no end
      of corn and bread-stuffs which he could send, if we could only receive them; but he knows very
      well he might as well try and send them to the moon. The people here are starving and want
      these bread-stuffs, and they are ready to pay for them by the products of their labour—and
      your blessed laws prevent them!”</p>
     <p>“But these laws did not prevent your carrying on a thriving trade with America for five
      years, according to your own account,” said Endymion. “I do not question what you say; I am
      asking only for information.”</p>
     <p>“What you say is fairly said, and it has been said before,” replied Thornberry; “but there
      is nothing in it. We had a trade, and a thriving trade, with the States; though, to be sure,
      it was always fitful and ought to have been ten times as much, even during those five years.
      But the fact is, the state of affairs in America was then exceptional. They were embarked in
      great public works in which every one was investing his capital; shares and stocks abounded,
      and they paid us for our goods with them.”</p>
     <p>“Then it would rather seem that they have no capital now to spare to purchase our
      goods?”</p>
     <p>“Not so,” said Thornberry sharply, “as I have shown; but were it so, it does not affect my
      principle. If there were free exchange, we should find employment and compensation in other
      countries, even if the States were logged, which I don’t believe thirty millions of people
      with boundless territory ever can be.”</p>
     <p>“But after all,” said Endymion, “America is as little in favour of free exchange as we are.
      She may send us her bread-stuffs; but her laws will not admit our goods, except on the payment
      of enormous duties.”</p>
     <p>“Pish!” said Thornberry; “I do not care this for their enormous duties. Let me have free
      imports, and I will soon settle their duties.”</p>
     <p>“To fight hostile tariffs with free imports,” said Endymion; “is not that fighting against
      odds?”</p>
     <p>“Not a bit. This country has nothing to do but to consider its imports. Foreigners will not
      give us their products for nothing; but as for their tariffs, if we were wise men, and looked
      to our real interests, their hostile tariffs, as you call them, would soon be falling down
      like an old wall.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I confess,” said Endymion, “I have for some time thought the principle of free
      exchange was a sound one; but its application in a country like this would be very difficult,
      and require, I should think, great prudence and moderation.”</p>
     <p>“By prudence and moderation you mean ignorance and timidity,” said Thornberry
      scornfully.</p>
     <p>“Not exactly that, I hope,” said Endymion; “but you cannot deny that the home market is a
      most important element in the consideration of our public wealth, and it mainly rests upon the
      agriculture of the country.”</p>
     <p>“Then it rests upon a very poor foundation,” said Thornberry.</p>
     <p>“But if any persons should be more tempted than others by free exchange, it should be the
      great body of the consumers of this land, who pay unjust and excessive prices for every
      article they require. No, my dear Mr. Ferrars; the question is a very simple one, and we may
      talk for ever, and we shall never alter it. The laws of this country are made by the
      proprietors of land, and they make them for their own benefit. A man with a large estate is
      said to have a great stake in the country because some hundreds of people or so are more or
      less dependent on him. How has he a greater interest in the country than a manufacturer who
      has sunk 100,000 pounds in machinery, and has a thousand people, as I had, receiving from him
      weekly wages? No home market, indeed! Pah! it is an affair of rent, and nothing more or less.
      And England is to be ruined to keep up rents. Are you going? Well, I am glad we have met.
      Perhaps we shall have another talk together some day. I shall not return to the works. There
      is little doing there, and I must think now of other things. The subscriptions to the League
      begin to come in apace. Say what they like in the House of Commons and the vile London press,
      the thing is stirring.”</p>
     <p>Wishing to turn the conversation a little, Endymion asked Mrs. Thornberry whether she
      occasionally went to London.</p>
     <p>“Never was there,” she said, in a sharp, clear voice; “but I hope to go soon.”</p>
     <p>“You will have a great deal to see.”</p>
     <p>“All I want to see, and hear, is the Rev. Servetus Frost,” replied the lady. “My idea of
      perfect happiness is to hear him every Sunday. He comes here sometimes, for his sister is
      settled here; a very big mill. He preached here a month ago. Should not I have liked the
      bishop to have heard him, that’s all! But he would not dare to go; he could not answer a
      point.”</p>
     <p>“My wife is of the Unitarian persuasion,” said Thornberry. “I am not. I was born in our
      Church, and I keep to it; but I often go to chapel with my wife. As for religion generally, if
      a man believes in his Maker and does his duty to his neighbours, in my mind that is
      sufficient.”</p>
     <p>Endymion bade them good-bye, and strolled musingly towards his hotel.</p>
     <p>Just as he reached the works again, he encountered Enoch Craggs, who was walking into
      Manchester.</p>
     <p>“I am going to our institute,” said Enoch. “I do not know why, but they have put me on the
      committee.”</p>
     <p>“And, I doubt not, they did very wisely,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Master Thornberry was glad to see you?” said Enoch.</p>
     <p>“And I was glad to see him.”</p>
     <p>“He has got the gift of speech,” said Enoch.</p>
     <p>“And that is a great gift.”</p>
     <p>“If wisely exercised, and I will not say he is not exercising it wisely. Certainly for his
      own purpose, but whether that purpose is for the general good—query?”</p>
     <p>“He is against monopoly,” observed Endymion inquiringly.</p>
     <p>“Query again?” said Enoch.</p>
     <p>“Well; he is opposed to the corn laws.”</p>
     <p>“The corn laws are very bad laws,” said Enoch, “and the sooner we get rid of them the
      better. But there are worse things than the corn laws.”</p>
     <p>“Hem!” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“There are the money laws,” said Enoch.</p>
     <p>“I did not know you cared so much about them at Manchester,” said Endymion. “I thought it
      was Birmingham that was chiefly interested about currency.”</p>
     <p>“I do not care one jot about currency,” said Enoch; “and, so far as I can judge, the
      Birmingham chaps talk a deal of nonsense about the matter. Leastwise, they will never convince
      me that a slip of irredeemable paper is as good as the young queen’s head on a twenty-shilling
      piece. I mean the laws that secure the accumulation of capital, by which means the real
      producers become mere hirelings, and really are little better than slaves.”</p>
     <p>“But surely without capital we should all of us be little better than slaves?”</p>
     <p>“I am not against capital,” replied Enoch. “What I am against is capitalists.”</p>
     <p>“But if we get rid of capitalists we shall soon get rid of capital.”</p>
     <p>“No, no,” said Enoch, with his broad accent, shaking his head, and with a laughing eye.
      “Master Thornberry has been telling you that. He is the most inveterate capitalist of the
      whole lot; and I always say, though they keep aloof from him at present, they will be all
      sticking to his skirts before long. Master Thornberry is against the capitalists in land; but
      there are other capitalists nearer home, and I know more about them. I was reading a book the
      other day about King Charles—Charles the First, whose head they cut off—I am very liking to
      that time, and read a good deal about it; and there was Lord Falkland, a great gentleman in
      those days, and he said, when Archbishop Laud was trying on some of his priestly tricks, that,
      ‘if he were to have a pope, he would rather the pope were at Rome than at Lambeth.’ So I
      sometimes think, if we are to be ruled by capitalists, I would sooner, perhaps, be ruled by
      gentlemen of estate, who have been long among us, than by persons who build big mills, who
      come from God knows where, and, when they have worked their millions out of our flesh and
      bone, go God knows where. But perhaps we shall get rid of them all some day—landlords and
      mill-lords.”</p>
     <p>“And whom will you substitute for them?”</p>
     <p>“The producers,” said Enoch, with a glance half savage, half triumphant.</p>
     <p>“What can workmen do without capital?”</p>
     <p>“Why, they make the capital,” said Enoch; “and if they make the capital, is it not strange
      that they should not be able to contrive some means to keep the capital? Why, Job was saying
      the other day that there was nothing like a principle to work upon. It would carry all before
      it. So say I. And I have a principle too, though it is not Master Thornberry’s. But it will
      carry all before it, though it may not be in my time. But I am not so sure of that.”</p>
     <p>“And what is it?” asked Endymion.</p>
     <p>“CO-OPERATION.” </p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXIV</head>
     <p>This strangely-revived acquaintance with Job Thornberry was not an unfruitful incident in
      the life of Endymion. Thornberry was a man of original mind and singular energy; and, although
      of extreme views on commercial subjects, all his conclusions were founded on extensive and
      various information, combined with no inconsiderable practice. The mind of Thornberry was
      essentially a missionary one. He was always ready to convert people; and he acted with ardour
      and interest on a youth who, both by his ability and his social position, was qualified to
      influence opinion. But this youth was gifted with a calm, wise judgment, of the extent and
      depth of which he was scarcely conscious himself; and Thornberry, like all propagandists, was
      more remarkable for his zeal and his convictions, than for that observation and perception of
      character which are the finest elements in the management of men and affairs.</p>
     <p>“What you should do,” said Thornberry, one day, to Endymion, “is to go to Scotland; go to
      the Glasgow district; that city itself, and Paisley, and Kilmarnock—keep your eye on Paisley.
      I am much mistaken if there will not soon be a state of things there which alone will break up
      the whole concern. It will burst it, sir; it will burst it.”</p>
     <p>So Endymion, without saying anything, quietly went to Glasgow and its district, and noted
      enough to make him resolve soon to visit there again; but the cabinet reassembled in the early
      part of November, and he had to return to his duties.</p>
     <p>In his leisure hours, Endymion devoted himself to the preparation of a report, for Mr.
      Sidney Wilton, on the condition and prospects of the manufacturing districts of the North of
      England, with some illustrative reference to that of the country beyond the Tweed. He
      concluded it before Christmas, and Mr. Wilton took it down with him to Gaydene, to study it at
      his leisure. Endymion passed his holidays with Lord and Lady Montfort, at their southern seat,
      Princedown.</p>
     <p>Endymion spoke to Lady Montfort a little about his labours, for he had no secrets from her;
      but she did not much sympathise with him, though she liked him to be sedulous and to
      distinguish himself. “Only,” she observed, “take care not to be <hi>doctrinaire</hi>,
      Endymion. I am always afraid of that with you. It is Sidney’s fault; he always was
       <hi>doctrinaire</hi>. It was a great thing for you becoming his private secretary; to be the
      private secretary of a cabinet minister is a real step in life, and I shall always be most
      grateful to Sidney, whom I love for appointing you; but still, if I could have had my wish,
      you should have been Lord Roehampton’s private secretary. That is real politics, and he is a
      real statesman. You must not let Mr. Wilton mislead you about the state of affairs in the
      cabinet. The cabinet consists of the prime minister and Lord Roehampton, and, if they are
      united, all the rest is vapour. And they will not consent to any nonsense about touching the
      corn laws; you may be sure of that. Besides, I will tell you a secret, which is not yet
      Pulchinello’s secret, though I daresay it will be known when we all return to town—we shall
      have a great event when parliament meets; a royal marriage. What think you of that? The young
      queen is going to be married, and to a young prince, like a prince in a fairy tale. As Lord
      Roehampton wrote to me this morning, ‘Our royal marriage will be much more popular than the
      Anti-Corn-Law League.’”</p>
     <p>The royal marriage was very popular; but, unfortunately, it reflected no splendour on the
      ministry. The world blessed the queen and cheered the prince, but shook its head at the
      government. Sir Robert Peel also—whether from his own motive or the irresistible impulse of
      his party need not now be inquired into—sanctioned a direct attack on the government, in the
      shape of a vote of want of confidence in them, immediately the court festivities were over,
      and the attack was defeated by a narrow majority.</p>
     <p>“Nothing could be more unprincipled,” said Berengaria, “after he had refused to take office
      last year. As for our majority, it is, under such circumstances, twenty times more than we
      want. As Lord Roehampton says, one is enough.”</p>
     <p>Trade and revenue continued to decline. There was again the prospect of a deficiency. The
      ministry, too, was kept in by the Irish vote, and the Irish then were very unpopular. The
      cabinet itself generally was downcast, and among themselves occasionally murmured a regret
      that they had not retired when the opportunity offered in the preceding year. Berengaria,
      however, would not bate an inch of confidence and courage. “You think too much,” she said to
      Endymion, “of trade and finance. Trade always comes back, and finance never ruined a country,
      or an individual either if he had pluck. Mr. Sidney Wilton is a croaker. The things he fears
      will never happen; or, if they do, will turn out to be unimportant. Look to Lord Roehampton;
      he is the man. He does not care a rush whether the revenue increases or declines. He is
      thinking of real politics: foreign affairs; maintaining our power in Europe. Something will
      happen, before the session is over, in the Mediterranean;” and she pressed her finger to her
      lip, and then she added, “The country will support Lord Roehampton as they supported Pitt, and
      give him any amount of taxes that he likes.”</p>
     <p>In the meantime, the social world had its incidents as well as the political, and not less
      interesting. Not one of the most insignificant, perhaps, was the introduction into society of
      the Countess of Beaumaris. Her husband, sacrificing even his hunting, had come up to town at
      the meeting of parliament, and received his friends in a noble mansion on Piccadilly Terrace.
      All its equipments were sumptuous and refined, and everything had been arranged under the
      personal supervision of Mr. Waldershare. They commenced very quietly; dinners little but
      constant, and graceful and finished as a banquet of Watteau. No formal invitations; men were
      brought in to dinner from the House of Lords “just up,” or picked up, as it were carelessly,
      in the House of Commons by Mr. Waldershare, or were asked by Imogene, at a dozen hours’
      notice, in billets of irresistible simplicity. Soon it was whispered about, that the thing to
      do was to dine with Beaumaris, and that Lady Beaumaris was “something too delightful.” Prince
      Florestan frequently dined there; Waldershare always there, in a state of coruscation; and
      every man of fashion in the opposite ranks, especially if they had brains.</p>
     <p>Then, in a little time, it was gently hoped that Imogene should call on their wives and
      mothers, or their wives and mothers call on her; and then she received, without any formal
      invitation, twice a week; and as there was nothing going on in London, or nothing half so
      charming, everybody who was anybody came to Piccadilly Terrace; and so as, after long
      observation, a new planet is occasionally discovered by a philosopher, thus society suddenly
      and indubitably discovered that there was at last a Tory house.</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton, duly apprised of affairs by her brother, had called on Lord and Lady
      Beaumaris, and had invited them to her house. It was the first appearance of Imogene in
      general society, and it was successful. Her large brown eyes, and long black lashes, her
      pretty mouth and dimple, her wondrous hair—which, it was whispered, unfolded, touched the
      ground—struck every one, and the dignified simplicity of her carriage was attractive. Her
      husband never left her side; while Mr. Waldershare was in every part of the saloons, watching
      her from distant points, to see how she got on, or catching the remarks of others on her
      appearance. Myra was kind to her as well as courteous, and, when the stream of arriving guests
      had somewhat ceased, sought her out and spoke to her; and then put her arm in hers, walked
      with her for a moment, and introduced her to one or two great personages, who had previously
      intimated their wish or their consent to that effect. Lady Montfort was not one of these. When
      parties are equal, and the struggle for power is intense, society loses much of its sympathy
      and softness. Lady Montfort could endure the presence of Tories, provided they were her
      kinsfolk, and would join, even at their houses, in traditionary festivities; but she shrank
      from passing the line, and at once had a prejudice against Imogene, who she instinctively felt
      might become a power for the enemy.</p>
     <p>“I will not have you talk so much to that Lady Beaumaris,” she said to Endymion.</p>
     <p>“She is an old friend of mine,” he replied.</p>
     <p>“How could you have known her? She was a shop-girl, was not she, or something of that
      sort?”</p>
     <p>“She and her family were very kind to me when I was not much better than a shop-boy myself,”
      replied Endymion, with a mantling cheek. “They are most respectable people, and I have a great
      regard for her.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed! Well; I will not keep you from your Tory woman,” said Berengaria rudely; and she
      walked away.</p>
     <p>Altogether, this season of ‘40 was not a very satisfactory one in any respect, as regarded
      society or the country in general. Party passion was at its highest. The ministry retained
      office almost by a casting vote; were frequently defeated on important questions; and whenever
      a vacancy occurred, it was filled by their opponents. Their unpopularity increased daily, and
      it was stimulated by the general distress. All that Job Thornberry had predicted as to the
      state of manufacturing Scotland duly occurred. Besides manufacturing distress, they had to
      encounter a series of bad harvests. Never was a body of statesmen placed in a more
      embarrassing and less enviable position. There was a prevalent, though unfounded, conviction
      that they were maintained in power by a combination of court favour with Irish sedition.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort and Lord Roehampton were the only persons who never lost heart. She was
      defiant; and he ever smiled, at least in public. “What nonsense!” she would say. “Mr. Sidney
      Wilton talks about the revenue falling off! As if the revenue could ever really fall off! And
      then our bad harvests. Why, that is the very reason we shall have an excellent harvest this
      year. You cannot go on always having bad harvests. Besides, good harvests never make a
      ministry popular. Nobody thanks a ministry for a good harvest. What makes a ministry popular
      is some great <hi>coup</hi> in foreign affairs.”</p>
     <p>Amid all these exciting disquietudes, Endymion pursued a life of enjoyment, but also of
      observation and much labour. He lived more and more with the Montforts, but the friendship of
      Berengaria was not frivolous. Though she liked him to be seen where he ought to figure, and
      required a great deal of attention herself, she ever impressed on him that his present life
      was only a training for a future career, and that his mind should ever be fixed on the
      attainment of a high position. Particularly she impressed on him the importance of being a
      linguist. “There will be a reaction some day from all this political economy,” she would say,
      “and then there will be no one ready to take the helm.” Endymion was not unworthy of the
      inspiring interest which Lady Montfort took in him. The terrible vicissitudes of his early
      years had gravely impressed his character. Though ambitious, he was prudent; and, though born
      to please and be pleased, he was sedulous and self-restrained. Though naturally deeply
      interested in the fortunes of his political friends, and especially of Lord Roehampton and Mr.
      Wilton, a careful scrutiny of existing circumstances had prepared him for an inevitable
      change; and, remembering what was their position but a few years back, he felt that his sister
      and himself should be reconciled to their altered lot, and be content. She would still be a
      peeress, and the happy wife of an illustrious man; and he himself, though he would have to
      relapse into the drudgery of a public office, would meet duties the discharge of which was
      once the object of his ambition, coupled now with an adequate income and with many
      friends.</p>
     <p>And among those friends, there were none with whom he maintained his relations more
      intimately than with the Neuchatels. He was often their guest both in town and at Hainault,
      and he met them frequently in society, always at the receptions of Lady Montfort and his
      sister. Zenobia used sometimes to send him a card; but these condescending recognitions of
      late had ceased, particularly as the great dame heard he was “always at that Lady
      Beaumaris’s.” One of the social incidents of his circle, not the least interesting to him, was
      the close attendance of Adriana and her mother on the ministrations of Nigel Penruddock. They
      had become among the most devoted of his flock; and this, too, when the rapid and startling
      development of his sacred offices had so alarmed the easy, though sagacious, Lord Roehampton,
      that he had absolutely expressed his wish to Myra that she should rarely attend them, and,
      indeed, gradually altogether drop a habit which might ultimately compromise her. Berengaria
      had long ago quitted him. This was attributed to her reputed caprice, yet it was not so. “I
      like a man to be practical,” she said. “When I asked for a deanery for him the other day, the
      prime minister said he could hardly make a man a dean who believed in the Real Presence.”
      Nigel’s church, however, was more crowded than ever, and a large body of the clergy began to
      look upon him as the coming man.</p>
     <p>Towards the end of the year the “great <hi>coup</hi> in foreign affairs,” which Lady
      Montfort had long brooded over, and indeed foreseen, occurred, and took the world, who were
      all thinking of something else, entirely by surprise. A tripartite alliance of great powers
      had suddenly started into life; the Egyptian host was swept from the conquered plains of Asia
      Minor and Syria by English blue-jackets; St. Jean d’Acre, which had baffled the great
      Napoleon, was bombarded and taken by a British fleet; and the whole fortunes of the world in a
      moment seemed changed, and permanently changed.</p>
     <p>“I am glad it did not occur in the season,” said Zenobia. “I really could not stand Lady
      Montfort if it were May.”</p>
     <p>The ministry was elate, and their Christmas was right merrie. There seemed good cause for
      this. It was a triumph of diplomatic skill, national valour, and administrative energy. Myra
      was prouder of her husband than ever, and, amid all the excitement, he smiled on her with
      sunny fondness. Everybody congratulated her. She gave a little reception before the holidays,
      to which everybody came who was in town or passing through. Even Zenobia appeared; but she
      stayed a very short time, talking very rapidly. Prince Florestan paid his grave devoirs, with
      a gaze which seemed always to search into Lady Roehampton’s inmost heart, yet never lingering
      about her; and Waldershare, full of wondrous compliments and conceits, and really
      enthusiastic, for he ever sympathised with action; and Imogene, gorgeous with the Beaumaris
      sapphires; and Sidney Wilton, who kissed his hostess’s hand, and Adriana, who kissed her
      cheek.</p>
     <p>“I tell you what, Mr. Endymion,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “you should make Lord Roehampton your
      Chancellor of the Exchequer, and then your government might perhaps go on a little.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXV</head>
     <p>But, as Mr. Tadpole observed, with much originality, at the Carlton, they were dancing on a
      volcano. It was December, and the harvest was not yet all got in, the spring corn had never
      grown, and the wheat was rusty; there was, he well knew, another deficiency in the revenue, to
      be counted by millions; wise men shook their heads and said the trade was leaving the country,
      and it was rumoured that the whole population of Paisley lived on the rates.</p>
     <p>“Lord Roehampton thinks that something must be done about the corn laws,” murmured
      Berengaria one day to Endymion, rather crestfallen; “but they will try sugar and timber first.
      I think it all nonsense, but nonsense is sometimes necessary.”</p>
     <p>This was the first warning of that famous budget of 1841 which led to such vast
      consequences, and which, directly or indirectly, gave such a new form and colour to English
      politics. Sidney Wilton and his friends were at length all-powerful in the cabinet, because,
      in reality, there was nobody to oppose them. The vessel was waterlogged. The premier shrugged
      his shoulders; and Lord Roehampton said, “We may as well try it, because the alternative is,
      we shall have to resign.”</p>
     <p>Affairs went on badly for the ministry during the early part of the session. They were more
      than once in a minority, and on Irish questions, which then deeply interested the country; but
      they had resolved that their fate should be decided by their financial measures, and Mr.
      Sidney Wilton and his friends were still sanguine as to the result. On the last day of April
      the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced the budget, and proposed to provide for the
      deficiency by reducing the protective duties on sugar and timber. A few days after, the leader
      of the House of Commons himself announced a change in the corn laws, and the intended
      introduction of grain at various-priced duties per quarter.</p>
     <p>Then commenced the struggle of a month. Ultimately, Sir Robert Peel himself gave notice of a
      resolution of want of confidence in the ministry; and after a week’s debate, it was carried,
      in an almost complete house, by a majority of one!</p>
     <p>It was generally supposed that the ministry would immediately resign. Their new measures had
      not revived their popularity, and the parliament in which they had been condemned had been
      elected under their own advice and influence. Mr. Sidney Wilton had even told Endymion to get
      their papers in order; and all around the somewhat dejected private secretary there were
      unmistakable signs of that fatal flitting which is peculiarly sickening to the youthful
      politician.</p>
     <p>He was breakfasting in his rooms at the Albany with not a good appetite. Although he had for
      some time contemplated the possibility of such changes—and contemplated them, as he thought,
      with philosophy—when it came to reality and practice, he found his spirit was by no means so
      calm, or his courage so firm, as he had counted on. The charms of office arrayed themselves
      before him. The social influence, the secret information, the danger, the dexterity, the
      ceaseless excitement, the delights of patronage which everybody affects to disregard, the
      power of benefiting others, and often the worthy and unknown which is a real joy—in
      eight-and-forty hours or so, all these, to which he had now been used for some time, and which
      with his plastic disposition had become a second nature, were to vanish, and probably never
      return. Why should they? He took the gloomiest view of the future, and his inward soul
      acknowledged that the man the country wanted was Peel. Why might he not govern as long as
      Pitt? He probably would. Peel! his father’s friend! And this led to a train of painful but
      absorbing memories, and he sat musing and abstracted, fiddling with an idle egg-spoon.</p>
     <p>His servant came in with a note, which he eagerly opened. It ran thus: “I must see you
      instantly. I am here in the brougham, Cork Street end. Come directly. B. M.”</p>
     <p>Endymion had to walk up half the Albany, and marked the brougham the whole way. There was in
      it an eager and radiant face.</p>
     <p>“You had better get in,” said Lady Montfort, “for in these stirring times some of the enemy
      may be passing. And now,” she continued, when the door was fairly shut, “nobody knows it, not
      five people. They are going to dissolve.”</p>
     <p>“To dissolve!” exclaimed Endymion. “Will that help us?”</p>
     <p>“Very likely,” said Berengaria. “We have had our share of bad luck, and now we may throw in.
      Cheap bread is a fine cry. Indeed it is too shocking that there should be laws which add to
      the price of what everybody agrees is the staff of life. But you do nothing but stare,
      Endymion; I thought you would be in a state of the greatest excitement!”</p>
     <p>“I am rather stunned than excited.”</p>
     <p>“Well, but you must not be stunned, you must act. This is a crisis for our party, but it is
      something more for you. It is your climacteric. They may lose; but you must win, if you will
      only bestir yourself. See the whips directly, and get the most certain seat you can. Nothing
      must prevent your being in the new parliament.”</p>
     <p>“I see everything to prevent it,” said Endymion. “I have no means of getting into
      parliament—no means of any kind.”</p>
     <p>“Means must be found,” said Lady Montfort. “We cannot stop now to talk about means. That
      would be a mere waste of time. The thing must be done. I am now going to your sister, to
      consult with her. All you have got to do is to make up your mind that you will be in the next
      parliament, and you will succeed; for everything in this world depends upon will.”</p>
     <p>“I think everything in this world depends upon woman,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“It is the same thing,” said Berengaria.</p>
     <p>Adriana was with Lady Roehampton when Lady Montfort was announced.</p>
     <p>Adriana came to console; but she herself was not without solace, for, if there were a change
      of government, she would see more of her friend.</p>
     <p>“Well; I was prepared for it,” said Lady Roehampton. “I have always been expecting something
      ever since what they called the Bed-Chamber Plot.”</p>
     <p>“Well; it gave us two years,” said Lady Montfort; “and we are not out yet.”</p>
     <p>Here were three women, young, beautiful, and powerful, and all friends of Endymion—real
      friends. Property does not consist merely of parks and palaces, broad acres, funds in many
      forms, services of plate, and collections of pictures. The affections of the heart are
      property, and the sympathy of the right person is often worth a good estate.</p>
     <p>These three charming women were cordial, and embraced each other when they met; but the
      conversation flagged, and the penetrating eye of Myra read in the countenance of Lady Montfort
      the urgent need of confidence.</p>
     <p>“So, dearest Adriana,” said Lady Roehampton, “we will drive out together at three o’clock. I
      will call on you.” And Adriana disappeared.</p>
     <p>“You know it?” said Lady Montfort when they were alone. “Of course you know it. Besides, I
      know you know it. What I have come about is this; your brother must be in the new
      parliament.”</p>
     <p>“I have not seen him; I have not mentioned it to him,” said Myra, somewhat hesitatingly.</p>
     <p>“I have seen him; I have mentioned it to him,” said Lady Montfort decidedly. “He makes
      difficulties; there must be none. He will consult you. I came on at once that you might be
      prepared. No difficulty must be admitted. His future depends on it.”</p>
     <p>“I live for his future,” said Lady Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“He will talk to you about money. These things always cost money. As a general rule, nobody
      has money who ought to have it. I know dear Lord Roehampton is very kind to you; but, all his
      life, he never had too much money at his command; though why, I never could make out. And my
      lord has always had too much money; but I do not much care to talk to him about these affairs.
      The thing must be done. What is the use of a diamond necklace if you cannot help a friend into
      parliament? But all I want to know now is that you will throw no difficulties in his way. Help
      him, too, if you can.”</p>
     <p>“I wish Endymion had married,” replied Myra.</p>
     <p>“Well; I do not see how that would help affairs,” said Lady Montfort. “Besides, I dislike
      married men. They are very uninteresting.”</p>
     <p>“I mean, I wish,” said Lady Roehampton musingly, “that he had made a great match.”</p>
     <p>“That is not very easy,” said Lady Montfort, “and great matches are generally failures. All
      the married heiresses I have known have shipwrecked.”</p>
     <p>“And yet it is possible to marry an heiress and love her,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“It is possible, but very improbable.”</p>
     <p>“I think one might easily love the person who has just left the room.”</p>
     <p>“Miss Neuchatel?”</p>
     <p>“Adriana. Do not you agree with me?”</p>
     <p>“Miss Neuchatel will never marry,” said Lady Montfort, “unless she loses her fortune.”</p>
     <p>“Well; do you know, I have sometimes thought that she liked Endymion? I never could
      encourage such a feeling; and Endymion, I am sure, would not. I wish, I almost wish,” added
      Lady Roehampton, trying to speak with playfulness, “that you would use your magic influence,
      dear Lady Montfort, and bring it about. He would soon get into parliament then.”</p>
     <p>“I have tried to marry Miss Neuchatel once,” said Lady Montfort, with a mantling cheek, “and
      I am glad to say I did not succeed. My match-making is over.”</p>
     <p>There was a dead silence; one of those still moments which almost seem inconsistent with
      life, certainly with the presence of more than one human being. Lady Roehampton seemed buried
      in deep thought. She was quite abstracted, her eyes fixed, and fixed upon the ground. All the
      history of her life passed through her brain—all the history of their lives; from the nursery
      to this proud moment, proud even with all its searching anxiety. And yet the period of silence
      could be counted almost by seconds. Suddenly she looked up with a flushed cheek and a dazed
      look, and said, “It must be done.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort sprang forward with a glance radiant with hope and energy, and kissed her on
      both cheeks. “Dearest Lady Roehampton,” she exclaimed, “dearest Myra! I knew you would agree
      with me. Yes! it must be done.”</p>
     <p>“You will see him perhaps before I do?” inquired Myra rather hesitatingly.</p>
     <p>“I see him every day at the same time,” replied Lady Montfort. “He generally walks down to
      the House of Commons with Mr. Wilton, and when they have answered questions, and he has got
      all the news of the lobby, he comes to me. I always manage to get home from my drive to give
      him half an hour before dinner.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXVI</head>
     <p>Lady Montfort drove off to the private residence of the Secretary of the Treasury, who was
      of course in the great secret. She looked over his lists, examined his books, and seemed to
      have as much acquaintance with electioneering details as that wily and experienced gentleman
      himself. “Is there anything I can do?” she repeatedly inquired; “command me without
      compunction. Is it any use giving any parties? Can I write any letters? Can I see
      anybody?”</p>
     <p>“If you could stir up my lord a little?” said the secretary inquiringly.</p>
     <p>“Well, that is difficult,” said Lady Montfort, “perhaps impossible. But you have all his
      influence, and when there is a point that presses you must let me know.”</p>
     <p>“If he would only speak to his agents?” said the secretary, “but they say he will not, and
      he has a terrible fellow in ——shire, who I hear is one of the stewards for a dinner to Sir
      Robert.”</p>
     <p>“I have stopped all that,” said Lady Montfort. “That was Odo’s doing, who is himself not
      very sound; full of prejudices about O’Connell, and all that stuff. But he must go with his
      party. You need not fear about him.”</p>
     <p>“Well! it is a leap in the dark,” said the secretary.</p>
     <p>“Oh! no,” said Lady Montfort, “all will go right. A starving people must be in favour of a
      government who will give them bread for nothing. By the by, there is one thing, my dear Mr.
      Secretary, you must remember. I must have one seat, a certain seat, reserved for my
      nomination.”</p>
     <p>“A certain seat in these days is a rare gem,” said the secretary.</p>
     <p>“Yes, but I must have it nevertheless,” said Lady Montfort. “I don’t care about the cost or
      the trouble—but it must be certain.”</p>
     <p>Then she went home and wrote a line to Endymion, to tell him that it was all settled, that
      she had seen his sister, who agreed with her that it must be done, and that she had called on
      the Secretary of the Treasury, and had secured a certain seat. “I wish you could come to
      luncheon,” she added, “but I suppose that is impossible; you are always so busy. Why were you
      not in the Foreign Office? I am now going to call on the Tory women to see how they look, but
      I shall be at home a good while before seven, and of course count on seeing you.”</p>
     <p>In the meantime, Endymion by no means shared the pleasurable excitement of his fair friend.
      His was an agitated walk from the Albany to Whitehall, where he resumed his duties moody and
      disquieted. There was a large correspondence this morning, which was a distraction and a
      relief, until the bell of Mr. Sidney Wilton sounded, and he was in attendance on his
      chief.</p>
     <p>“It is a great secret,” said Mr. Wilton, “but I think I ought to tell you; instead of
      resigning, the government have decided to dissolve. I think it a mistake, but I stand by my
      friends. They believe the Irish vote will be very large, and with cheap bread will carry us
      through. I think the stronger we shall be in Ireland the weaker we shall be in England, and I
      doubt whether our cheap bread will be cheap enough. These Manchester associations have altered
      the aspect of affairs. I have been thinking a good deal about your position. I should like,
      before we broke up, to have seen you provided for by some permanent office of importance in
      which you might have been useful to the state, but it is difficult to manage these things
      suddenly. However, now we have time at any rate to look about us. Still, if I could have seen
      you permanently attached to this office in a responsible position, I should have been glad. I
      impressed upon the chief yesterday that you are most fit for it.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! do not think of me, dear sir; you have been always too kind to me. I shall be content
      with my lot. All I shall regret is ceasing to serve you.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort’s carriage drove up to Montfort House just as Endymion reached the door. She
      took his arm with eagerness; she seemed breathless with excitement. “I fear I am very late,
      but if you had gone away I should never have pardoned you. I have been kept by listening to
      all the new appointments from Lady Bellasyse. They quite think we are out; you may be sure I
      did not deny it. I have so much to tell you. Come into my lord’s room; he is away fishing.
      Think of fishing at such a crisis! I cannot tell you how pleased I was with my visit to Lady
      Roehampton. She quite agreed with me in everything. ‘It must be done,’ she said. How very
      right! and I have almost done it. I will have a certain seat; no chances. Let us have
      something to fall back upon. If not in office we shall be in opposition. All men must sometime
      or other be in opposition. There you will form yourself. It is a great thing to have had some
      official experience. It will save you from mares’ nests, and I will give parties without end,
      and never rest till I see you prime minister.”</p>
     <p>So she threw herself into her husband’s easy chair, tossed her parasol on the table, and
      then she said, “But what is the matter with you, Endymion? you look quite sad. You do not mean
      you really take our defeat—which is not certain yet—so much to heart. Believe me, opposition
      has its charms; indeed, I sometimes think the principal reason why I have enjoyed our
      ministerial life so much is, that it has been from the first a perpetual struggle for
      existence.”</p>
     <p>“I do not pretend to be quite indifferent to the probably impending change,” said Endymion,
      “but I cannot say there is anything about it which would affect my feelings very deeply.”</p>
     <p>“What is it, then?”</p>
     <p>“It is this business about which you and Myra are so kindly interesting yourselves,” said
      Endymion with some emotion; “I do not think I could go into parliament.”</p>
     <p>“Not go into parliament!” exclaimed Lady Montfort. “Why, what are men made for except to go
      into parliament? I am indeed astounded.”</p>
     <p>“I do not disparage parliament,” said Endymion; “much the reverse. It is a life that I think
      would suit me, and I have often thought the day might come”——</p>
     <p>“The day has come,” said Lady Montfort, “and not a bit too soon. Mr. Fox went in before he
      was of age, and all young men of spirit should do the same. Why! you are two-and-twenty!”</p>
     <p>“It is not my age,” said Endymion hesitatingly; “I am not afraid about that, for from the
      life which I have led of late years, I know a good deal about the House of Commons.”</p>
     <p>“Then what is it, dear Endymion?” said Lady Montfort impatiently.</p>
     <p>“It will make a great change in my life,” said Endymion calmly, but with earnestness, “and
      one which I do not feel justified in accepting.”</p>
     <p>“I repeat to you, that you need give yourself no anxiety about the seat,” said Lady
      Montfort. “It will not cost you a shilling. I and your sister have arranged all that. As she
      very wisely said, ‘It must be done,’ and it is done. All you have to do is to write an
      address, and make plenty of speeches, and you are M.P. for life, or as long as you like.”</p>
     <p>“Possibly; a parliamentary adventurer, I might swim or I might sink; the chances are it
      would be the latter, for storms would arise, when those disappear who have no root in the
      country, and no fortune to secure them breathing time and a future.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I did not expect, when you handed me out of my carriage to-day, that I was going to
      listen to a homily on prudence.”</p>
     <p>“It is not very romantic, I own,” said Endymion, “but my prudence is at any rate not a
      commonplace caught up from copy-books. I am only two-and-twenty, but I have had some
      experience, and it has been very bitter. I have spoken to you, dearest lady, sometimes of my
      earlier life, for I wished you to be acquainted with it, but I observed also you always seemed
      to shrink from such confidence, and I ceased from touching on what I saw did not interest
      you.”</p>
     <p>“Quite a mistake. It greatly interested me. I know all about you and everything. I know you
      were not always a clerk in a public office, but the spoiled child of splendour. I know your
      father was a dear good man, but he made a mistake, and followed the Duke of Wellington instead
      of Mr. Canning. Had he not, he would probably be alive now, and certainly Secretary of State,
      like Mr. Sidney Wilton. But <hi>you</hi> must not make a mistake, Endymion. My business in
      life, and your sister’s too, is to prevent your making mistakes. And you are on the eve of
      making a very great one if you lose this golden opportunity. Do not think of the past; you
      dwell on it too much. Be like me, live in the present, and when you dream, dream of the
      future.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! the present would be adequate, it would be fascination, if I always had such a
      companion as Lady Montfort,” said Endymion, shaking his head. “What surprises me most, what
      indeed astounds me, is that Myra should join in this counsel—Myra, who knows all, and who has
      felt it perhaps deeper even than I did. But I will not obtrude these thoughts on you, best and
      dearest of friends. I ought not to have made to you the allusions to my private position which
      I have done, but it seemed to me the only way to explain my conduct, otherwise
      inexplicable.”</p>
     <p>“And to whom ought you to say these things if not to me,” said Lady Montfort, “whom you
      called just now your best and dearest friend? I wish to be such to you. Perhaps I have been
      too eager, but, at any rate, it was eagerness for your welfare. Let us then be calm. Speak to
      me as you would to Myra. I cannot be your twin, but I can be your sister in feeling.”</p>
     <p>He took her hand and gently pressed it to his lips; his eyes would have been bedewed, had
      not the dreadful sorrows and trials of his life much checked his native susceptibility. Then
      speaking in a serious tone, he said, “I am not without ambition, dearest Lady Montfort; I have
      had visions which would satisfy even you; but partly from my temperament, still more perhaps
      from the vicissitudes of my life, I have considerable waiting powers. I think if one is
      patient and watches, all will come of which one is capable; but no one can be patient who is
      not independent. My wants are moderate, but their fulfilment must be certain. The break-up of
      the government, which deprives me of my salary as a private secretary, deprives me of luxuries
      which I can do without—a horse, a brougham, a stall at the play, a flower in my
      button-hole—but my clerkship is my freehold. As long as I possess it, I can study, I can work,
      I can watch and comprehend all the machinery of government. I can move in society, without
      which a public man, whatever his talents or acquirements, is in life playing at blind-man’s
      buff. I must sacrifice this citadel of my life if I go into parliament. Do not be offended,
      therefore, if I say to you, as I shall say to Myra, I have made up my mind not to surrender
      it. It is true I have the misfortune to be a year older than Charles Fox when he entered the
      senate, but even with this great disadvantage I am sometimes conceited enough to believe that
      I shall succeed, and to back myself against the field.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXVII</head>
     <p>Mr. Waldershare was delighted when the great secret was out, and he found that the ministry
      intended to dissolve, and not resign. It was on a Monday that Lord John Russell made this
      announcement, and Waldershare met Endymion in the lobby of the House of Commons. “I
      congratulate you, my dear boy; your fellows, at least, have pluck. If they lose, which I think
      they will, they will have gained at least three months of power, and irresponsible power. Why!
      they may do anything in the interval, and no doubt will. You will see; they will make their
      chargers consuls. It beats the Bed-Chamber Plot, and I always admired that. One hundred days!
      Why, the Second Empire lasted only one hundred days. But what days! what excitement! They were
      worth a hundred years at Elba.”</p>
     <p>“Your friends do not seem quite so pleased as you are,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“My friends, as you call them, are old fogies, and want to divide the spoil among the
      ancient hands. It will be a great thing for Peel to get rid of some of these old friends. A
      dissolution permits the powerful to show their power. There is Beaumaris, for example; now he
      will have an opportunity of letting them know who Lord Beaumaris is. I have a dream; he must
      be Master of the Horse. I shall never rest till I see Imogene riding in that golden coach, and
      breaking the line with all the honours of royalty.”</p>
     <p>“Mr. Ferrars,” said the editor of a newspaper, seizing his watched-for opportunity as
      Waldershare and Endymion separated, “do you think you could favour me this evening with Mr.
      Sidney Wilton’s address? We have always supported Mr. Wilton’s views on the corn laws, and if
      put clearly and powerfully before the country at this junction, the effect might be great,
      perhaps even, if sustained, decisive.”</p>
     <p>Eight-and-forty hours and more had elapsed since the conversation between Endymion and Lady
      Montfort; they had not been happy days. For the first time during their acquaintance there had
      been constraint and embarrassment between them. Lady Montfort no longer opposed his views, but
      she did not approve them. She avoided the subject; she looked uninterested in all that was
      going on around her; talked of joining her lord and going a-fishing; felt he was right in his
      views of life. “Dear Simon was always right,” and then she sighed, and then she shrugged her
      pretty shoulders. Endymion, though he called on her as usual, found there was nothing to
      converse about; politics seemed tacitly forbidden, and when he attempted small talk Lady
      Montfort seemed absent—and once absolutely yawned.</p>
     <p>What amazed Endymion still more was, that, under these rather distressing circumstances, he
      did not find adequate support and sympathy in his sister. Lady Roehampton did not question the
      propriety of his decision, but she seemed quite as unhappy and as dissatisfied as Lady
      Montfort.</p>
     <p>“What you say, dearest Endymion, is quite unanswerable, and I alone perhaps can really know
      that; but what I feel is, I have failed in life. My dream was to secure you greatness, and
      now, when the first occasion arrives, it seems I am more than powerless.”</p>
     <p>“Dearest sister! you have done so much for me.”</p>
     <p>“Nothing,” said Lady Roehampton; “what I have done for you would have been done by every
      sister in this metropolis. I dreamed of other things; I fancied, with my affection and my
      will, I could command events, and place you on a pinnacle. I see my folly now; others have
      controlled your life, not I—as was most natural; natural, but still bitter.”</p>
     <p>“Dearest Myra!”</p>
     <p>“It is so, Endymion. Let us deceive ourselves no longer. I ought not to have rested until
      you were in a position which would have made you a master of your destiny.”</p>
     <p>“But if there should be such a thing as destiny, it will not submit to the mastery of
      man.”</p>
     <p>“Do not split words with me; you know what I mean; you feel what I mean; I mean much more
      than I say, and you understand much more than I say. My lord told me to ask you to dine with
      us, if you called, but I will not ask you. There is no joy in meeting at present. I feel as I
      felt in our last year at Hurstley.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! don’t say that, dear Myra!” and Endymion sprang forward and kissed her very much.
      “Trust me; all will come right; a little patience, and all will come right.”</p>
     <p>“I have had patience enough in life,” said Lady Roehampton; “years of patience, the most
      doleful, the most dreary, the most dark and tragical. And I bore it all, and I bore it well,
      because I thought of you, and had confidence in you, and confidence in your star; and because,
      like an idiot, I had schooled myself to believe that, if I devoted my will to you, that star
      would triumph.”</p>
     <p>So, the reader will see, that our hero was not in a very serene and genial mood when he was
      buttonholed by the editor in the lobby, and, it is feared, he was unusually curt with that
      gentleman, which editors do not like, and sometimes reward with a leading article in
      consequence, on the character and career of our political chief, perhaps with some passing
      reference to jacks-in-office, and the superficial impertinence of private secretaries. These
      wise and amiable speculators on public affairs should, however, sometimes charitably remember
      that even ministers have their chagrins, and that the trained temper and imperturbable
      presence of mind of their aides-de-camp are not absolutely proof to all the infirmities of
      human nature.</p>
     <p>Endymion had returned home from the lobby, depressed and dispirited. The last incident of
      our life shapes and colours our feelings. Ever since he had settled in London, his life might
      be said to have been happy, gradually and greatly prosperous. The devotion of his sister and
      the eminent position she had achieved, the friendship of Lady Montfort, and the kindness of
      society, who had received him with open arms, his easy circumstances after painful narrowness
      of means, his honourable and interesting position—these had been the chief among many other
      causes which had justly rendered Endymion Ferrars a satisfied and contented man. And it was
      more than to be hoped that not one of these sources would be wanting in his future. And yet he
      felt dejected, even to unhappiness. Myra figured to his painful consciousness only as deeply
      wounded in her feelings, and he somehow the cause; Lady Montfort, from whom he had never
      received anything but smiles and inspiring kindness, and witty raillery, and affectionate
      solicitude for his welfare, offended and estranged. And as for society, perhaps it would make
      a great difference in his position if he were no longer a private secretary to a cabinet
      minister and only a simple clerk; he could not, even at this melancholy moment, dwell on his
      impending loss of income, though that increase at the time had occasioned him, and those who
      loved him, so much satisfaction. And yet was he in fault? Had his decision been a
      narrow-minded and craven one? He could not bring himself to believe so—his conscience assured
      him that he had acted rightly. After all that he had experienced, he was prepared to welcome
      an obscure, but could not endure a humiliating position.</p>
     <p>It was a long summer evening. The House had not sat after the announcement of the ministers.
      The twilight lingered with a charm almost as irresistible as among woods and waters. Endymion
      had been engaged to dine out, but had excused himself. Had it not been for the Montfort
      misunderstanding, he would have gone; but that haunted him. He had not called on her that day;
      he really had not courage to meet her. He was beginning to think that he might never see her
      again; never, certainly, on the same terms. She had the reputation of being capricious, though
      she had been constant in her kindness to him. Never see her again, or only see her changed! He
      was not aware of the fulness of his misery before; he was not aware, until this moment, that
      unless he saw her every day life would be intolerable.</p>
     <p>He sat down at his table, covered with notes in every female handwriting except the right
      one, and with cards of invitation to banquets and balls and concerts, and “very earlies,” and
      carpet dances—for our friend was a very fashionable young man—but what is the use of even
      being fashionable, if the person you love cares for you no more? And so out of very
      wantonness, instead of opening notes sealed or stamped with every form of coronet, he took up
      a business-like epistle, closed only with a wafer, and saying in drollery, “I should think a
      dun,” he took out a script receipt for 20,000 pounds consols, purchased that morning in the
      name of Endymion Ferrars, Esq. It was enclosed in half a sheet of note-paper, on which were
      written these words, in a handwriting which gave no clue of acquaintanceship, or even sex:
      “Mind—you are to send me your first frank.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER LXVIII</head>
     <p>It was useless to ask who could it be? It could only be one person; and yet how could it
      have been managed? So completely and so promptly! Her lord, too, away; the only being, it
      would seem, who could have effected for her such a purpose, and he the last individual to
      whom, perhaps, she would have applied. Was it a dream? The long twilight was dying away, and
      it dies away in the Albany a little sooner than it does in Park Lane; and so he lit the
      candles on his mantel-piece, and then again unfolded the document carefully, and read it and
      re-read it. It was not a dream. He held in his hand firmly, and read with his eyes clearly,
      the evidence that he was the uncontrolled master of no slight amount of capital, and which, if
      treated with prudence, secured to him for life an absolute and becoming independence. His
      heart beat and his cheek glowed.</p>
     <p>What a woman! And how true were Myra’s last words at Hurstley, that women would be his best
      friends in life! He ceased to think; and, dropping into his chair, fell into a reverie, in
      which the past and the future seemed to blend, with some mingling of a vague and almost
      ecstatic present. It was a dream of fair women, and even fairer thoughts, domestic tenderness
      and romantic love, mixed up with strange vicissitudes of lofty and fiery action, and
      passionate passages of eloquence and power. The clock struck and roused him from his musing.
      He fell from the clouds. Could he accept this boon? Was his doing so consistent with that
      principle of independence on which he had resolved to build up his life? The boon thus
      conferred might be recalled and returned; not legally indeed, but by a stronger influence than
      any law—the consciousness on his part that the feeling of interest in his life which had
      prompted it might change—would, must change. It was the romantic impulse of a young and
      fascinating woman, who had been to him invariably kind, but who had a reputation for caprice,
      which was not unknown to him. It was a wild and beautiful adventure; but only that.</p>
     <p>He walked up and down his rooms for a long time, sometimes thinking, sometimes merely
      musing; sometimes in a pleased but gently agitated state of almost unconsciousness. At last he
      sate down at his writing-table, and wrote for some time; and then directing the letter to the
      Countess of Montfort, he resolved to change the current of his thoughts, and went to a
      club.</p>
     <p>Morning is not romantic. Romance is the twilight spell; but morn is bright and joyous,
      prompt with action, and full of sanguine hope. Life has few difficulties in the morning, at
      least, none which we cannot conquer; and a private secretary to a minister, young and
      prosperous, at his first meal, surrounded by dry toast, all the newspapers, and piles of
      correspondence, asking and promising everything, feels with pride and delight the sense of
      powerful and responsible existence. Endymion had glanced at all the leading articles, had
      sorted in the correspondence the grain from the chaff, and had settled in his mind those who
      must be answered and those who must be seen. The strange incident of last night was of course
      not forgotten, but removed, as it were, from his consciousness in the bustle and pressure of
      active life, when his servant brought him a letter in a handwriting he knew right well. He
      would not open it till he was alone, and then it was with a beating heart and a burning
      cheek.</p>
     <p>LADY MONTFORT’S LETTER</p>
     <p>“What is it all about? and what does it all mean? I should have thought some great calamity
      had occurred if, however distressing, it did not appear in some sense to be gratifying. What
      is gratifying? You deal in conundrums, which I never could find out. Of course I shall be at
      home to you at any time, if you wish to see me. Pray come on at once, as I detest mysteries. I
      went to the play last night with your sister. We both of us rather expected to see you, but it
      seems neither of us had mentioned to you we were going. I did not, for I was too low-spirited
      about your affairs. You lost nothing. The piece was stupid beyond expression. We laughed
      heartily, at least I did, to show we were not afraid. My lord came home last night suddenly.
      Odo is going to stand for the county, and his borough is vacant. What an opportunity it would
      have been for you! a certain seat. But I care for no boroughs now. My lord will want you to
      dine with him to-day; I hope you can come. Perhaps he will not be able to see you this
      morning, as his agent will be with him about these elections. Adieu!”</p>
     <p>If Lady Montfort did not like conundrums, she had succeeded, however, in sending one
      sufficiently perplexing to Endymion. Could it be possible that the writer of this letter was
      the unknown benefactress of the preceding eve? Lady Montfort was not a mystifier. Her nature
      was singularly frank and fearless, and when Endymion told her everything that had occurred,
      and gave her the document which originally he had meant to bring with him in order to return
      it, her amazement and her joy were equal.</p>
     <p>“I wish I had sent it,” said Lady Montfort, “but that was impossible. I do not care who did
      send it; I have no female curiosity except about matters which, by knowledge, I may influence.
      This is finished. You are free. You cannot hesitate as to your course. I never could speak to
      you again if you did hesitate. Stop here, and I will go to my lord. This is a great day. If we
      can settle only to-day that you shall be the candidate for our borough, I really shall not
      much care for the change of ministry.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort was a long time away. Endymion would have liked to have gone forth on his
      affairs, but she had impressed upon him so earnestly to wait for her return that he felt he
      could not retire. The room was one to which he was not unaccustomed, otherwise, its contents
      would not have been uninteresting; her portrait by more than one great master, a miniature of
      her husband in a Venetian dress upon her writing-table—a table which wonderfully indicated
      alike the lady of fashion and the lady of business, for there seemed to be no form in which
      paper could be folded and emblazoned which was there wanting; quires of letter paper, and note
      paper, and notelet paper, from despatches of state to billet-doux, all were ready; great
      covers with arms and supporters, more moderate ones with “Berengaria” in letters of glittering
      fancy, and the destined shells of diminutive effusions marked only with a golden bee. There
      was another table covered with trinkets and precious toys; snuff-boxes and patch-boxes
      beautifully painted, exquisite miniatures, rare fans, cups of agate, birds glittering with
      gems almost as radiant as the tropic plumage they imitated, wild animals cut out of ivory, or
      formed of fantastic pearls—all the spoils of queens and royal mistresses.</p>
     <p>Upon the walls were drawings of her various homes; that of her childhood, as well as of the
      hearths she ruled and loved. There were a few portraits on the walls also of those whom she
      ranked as her particular friends. Lord Roehampton was one, another was the Count of
      Ferroll.</p>
     <p>Time went on; on a little table, by the side of evidently her favourite chair, was a book
      she had been reading. It was a German tale of fame, and Endymion, dropping into her seat,
      became interested in a volume which hitherto he had never seen, but of which he had heard
      much.</p>
     <p>Perhaps he had been reading for some time; there was a sound, he started and looked up, and
      then, springing from his chair, he said, “Something has happened!”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort was quite pale, and the expression of her countenance distressed, but when he
      said these words she tried to smile, and said, “No, no, nothing, nothing,—at least nothing to
      distress you. My lord hopes you will be able to dine with him to-day, and tell him all the
      news.” And then she threw herself into a chair and sighed. “I should like to have a good cry,
      as the servants say—but I never could cry. I will tell you all about it in a moment. You were
      very good not to go.”</p>
     <p>It seems that Lady Montfort saw her lord before the agent, who was waiting, had had his
      interview, and the opportunity being in every way favourable, she felt the way about obtaining
      his cousin’s seat for Endymion. Lord Montfort quite embraced this proposal. It had never
      occurred to him. He had no idea that Ferrars contemplated parliament. It was a capital idea.
      He could not bear reading the parliament reports, and yet he liked to know a little of what
      was going on. Now, when anything happened of interest, he should have it all from the
      fountain-head. “And you must tell him, Berengaria,” he continued, “that he can come and dine
      here whenever he likes, in boots. It is a settled thing that M.P.‘s may dine in boots. I think
      it a most capital plan. Besides, I know it will please you. You will have your own
      member.”</p>
     <p>Then he rang the bell, and begged Lady Montfort to remain and see the agent. Nothing like
      the present time for business. They would make all the arrangements at once, and he would ask
      the agent to dine with them to-day, and so meet Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>So the agent entered, and it was all explained to him, calmly and clearly, briefly by my
      lord, but with fervent amplification by his charming wife. The agent several times attempted
      to make a remark, but for some time he was unsuccessful; Lady Montfort was so anxious that he
      should know all about Mr. Ferrars, the most rising young man of the day, the son of the Right
      Honourable William Pitt Ferrars, who, had he not died, would probably have been prime
      minister, and so on.</p>
     <p>“Mr. Ferrars seems to be everything we could wish,” said the agent, “and as you say, my
      lady, though he is young, so was Mr. Pitt, and I have little doubt, after what you say, my
      lady, that it is very likely he will in time become as eminent. But what I came up to town
      particularly to impress upon my lord is, that if Mr. Odo will not stand again, we are in a
      very great difficulty.”</p>
     <p>“Difficulty about what?” said Lady Montfort impatiently.</p>
     <p>“Well, my lady, if Mr. Odo stands, there is great respect for him. The other side would not
      disturb him. He has been member for some years, and my lord has been very liberal. But the
      truth is, if Mr. Odo does not stand, we cannot command the seat.”</p>
     <p>“Not command the seat! Then our interest must have been terribly neglected.”</p>
     <p>“I hope not, my lady,” said the agent. “The fact is, the property is against us.”</p>
     <p>“I thought it was all my lord’s.”</p>
     <p>“No, my lady; the strong interest in the borough is my Lord Beaumaris. It used to be about
      equal, but all the new buildings are in Lord Beaumaris’ part of the borough. It would not have
      signified if things had remained as in the old days. The grandfather of the present lord was a
      Whig, and always supported the Montforts, but that’s all changed. The present earl has gone
      over to the other side, and, I hear, is very strong in his views.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort had to communicate all this to Endymion. “You will meet the agent at dinner,
      but he did not give me a ray of hope. Go now; indeed, I have kept you too long. I am so
      stricken that I can scarcely command my senses. Only think of our borough being stolen from us
      by Lord Beaumaris! I have brought you no luck, Endymion; I have done you nothing but mischief;
      I am miserable. If you had attached yourself to Lady Beaumaris, you might have been a member
      of parliament.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER I</head>
     <p>In the meantime, the great news being no longer a secret, the utmost excitement prevailed in
      the world of politics. The Tories had quite made up their minds that the ministry would have
      resigned, and were sanguine, under such circumstances, of the result. The parliament, which
      the ministry was going to dissolve, was one which had been elected by their counsel and under
      their auspices. It was unusual, almost unconstitutional, thus to terminate the body they had
      created. Nevertheless, the Whigs, never too delicate in such matters, thought they had a
      chance, and determined not to lose it. One thing they immediately succeeded in, and that was,
      frightening their opponents. A dissolution with the Tories in opposition was not pleasant to
      that party; but a dissolution with a cry of “Cheap bread!” amid a partially starving
      population, was not exactly the conjuncture of providential circumstances which had long been
      watched and wished for, and cherished and coddled and proclaimed and promised, by the
      energetic army of Conservative wire-pullers.</p>
     <p>Mr. Tadpole was very restless at the crowded Carlton, speaking to every one, unhesitatingly
      answering every question, alike cajoling and dictatorial, and yet, all the time, watching the
      door of the morning room with unquiet anxiety.</p>
     <p>“They will never be able to get up the steam, Sir Thomas; the Chartists are against them.
      The Chartists will never submit to anything that is cheap. In spite of their wild fancies,
      they are real John Bulls. I beg your pardon, but I see a gentleman I must speak to,” and he
      rushed towards the door as Waldershare entered.</p>
     <p>“Well, what is your news?” asked Mr. Tadpole, affecting unconcern.</p>
     <p>“I come here for news,” said Waldershare. “This is my Academus, and you, Tadpole, are my
      Plato.”</p>
     <p>“Well, if you want the words of a wise man, listen to me. If I had a great friend, which Mr.
      Waldershare probably has, who wants a great place, these are times in which such a man should
      show his power.”</p>
     <p>“I have a great friend whom I wish to have a great place,” said Waldershare, “and I think he
      is quite ready to show his power, if he knew exactly how to exercise it.”</p>
     <p>“What I am saying to you is not known to a single person in this room, and to only one out
      of it, but you may depend upon what I say. Lord Montfort’s cousin retires from Northborough to
      sit for the county. They think they can nominate his successor as a matter of course. A
      delusion; your friend Lord Beaumaris can command the seat.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I think you can depend on Beaumaris,” said Waldershare, much interested.</p>
     <p>“I depend upon you,” said Mr. Tadpole, with a glance of affectionate credulity. “The party
      already owes you much. This will be a crowning service.”</p>
     <p>“Beaumaris is rather a queer man to deal with,” said Waldershare; “he requires gentle
      handling.”</p>
     <p>“All the world says he consults you on everything.”</p>
     <p>“All the world, as usual, is wrong,” said Waldershare. “Lord Beaumaris consults no one
      except Lady Beaumaris.”</p>
     <p>“Well then we shall do,” rejoined Mr. Tadpole triumphantly. “Our man that I want him to
      return is a connection of Lady Beaumaris, a Mr. Rodney, very anxious to get into parliament,
      and rich. I do not know who he is exactly, but it is a good name; say a cousin of Lord Rodney
      until the election is over, and then they may settle it as they like.”</p>
     <p>“A Mr. Rodney,” said Waldershare musingly; “well, if I hear anything I will let you know. I
      suppose you are in pretty good spirits?”</p>
     <p>“I should like a little sunshine. A cold spring, and now a wet summer, and the certainty of
      a shocking harvest combined with manufacturing distress spreading daily, is not pleasant, but
      the English are a discriminating people. They will hardly persuade them that Sir Robert has
      occasioned the bad harvests.”</p>
     <p>“The present men are clearly responsible for all that,” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>There was a reception at Lady Roehampton’s this evening. Very few Tories attended it, but
      Lady Beaumaris was there. She never lost an opportunity of showing by her presence how
      grateful she was to Myra for the kindness which had greeted Imogene when she first entered
      society. Endymion, as was his custom when the opportunity offered, rather hung about Lady
      Beaumaris. She always welcomed him with unaffected cordiality and evident pleasure. He talked
      to her, and then gave way to others, and then came and talked to her again, and then he
      proposed to take her to have a cup of tea, and she assented to the proposal with a brightening
      eye and a bewitching smile.</p>
     <p>“I suppose your friends are very triumphant, Lady Beaumaris?” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Yes; they naturally are very excited. I confess I am not myself.”</p>
     <p>“But you ought to be,” said Endymion. “You will have an immense position. I should think
      Lord Beaumaris would have any office he chose, and yours will be the chief house of the
      party.”</p>
     <p>“I do not know that Lord Beaumaris would care to have office, and I hardly think any office
      would suit him. As for myself, I am obliged to be ambitious, but I have no ambition, or rather
      I would say, I think I was happier when we all seemed to be on the same side.”</p>
     <p>“Well, those were happy days,” said Endymion, “and these are happy days. And few things make
      me happier than to see Lady Beaumaris admired and appreciated by every one.”</p>
     <p>“I wish you would not call me Lady Beaumaris. That may be, and indeed perhaps is, necessary
      in society, but when we are alone, I prefer being called by a name which once you always and
      kindly used.”</p>
     <p>“I shall always love the name,” said Endymion, “and,” he added with some hesitation, “shall
      always love her who bears it.”</p>
     <p>She involuntarily pressed his arm, though very slightly; and then in rather a hushed and
      hurried tone she said, “They were talking about you at dinner to-day. I fear this change of
      government, if there is to be one, will be injurious to you—losing your private secretaryship
      to Mr. Wilton, and perhaps other things?”</p>
     <p>“Fortune of war,” said Endymion; “we must bear these haps. But the truth is, I think it is
      not unlikely that there may be a change in my life which may be incompatible with retaining my
      secretaryship under any circumstances.”</p>
     <p>“You are not going to be married?” she said quickly.</p>
     <p>“Not the slightest idea of such an event.”</p>
     <p>“You are too young to marry.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am older than you.”</p>
     <p>“Yes; but men and women are different in that matter. Besides, you have too many fair
      friends to marry, at least at present. What would Lady Roehampton say?”</p>
     <p>“Well, I have sometimes thought my sister wished me to marry.”</p>
     <p>“But then there are others who are not sisters, but who are equally interested in your
      welfare,” said Lady Beaumaris, looking up into his face with her wondrous eyes; but the lashes
      were so long, that it was impossible to decide whether the glance was an anxious one or one
      half of mockery.</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not think I shall ever marry,” said Endymion. “The change in my life I was
      alluding to is one by no means of a romantic character. I have some thoughts of trying my luck
      on the hustings, and getting into parliament.”</p>
     <p>“That would be delightful,” said Lady Beaumaris. “Do you know that it has been one of my
      dreams that you should be in parliament?”</p>
     <p>“Ah! dearest Imogene, for you said I might call you Imogene, you must take care what you
      say. Remember we are unhappily in different camps. You must not wish me success in my
      enterprise; quite the reverse; it is more than probable that you will have to exert all your
      influence against me; yes, canvass against me, and wear hostile ribbons, and use all your
      irresistible charms to array electors against me, or to detach them from my ranks.”</p>
     <p>“Even in jest, you ought not to say such things,” said Lady Beaumaris.</p>
     <p>“But I am not in jest, I am in dreadful earnest. Only this morning I was offered a seat,
      which they told me was secure; but when I inquired into all the circumstances, I found the
      interest of Lord Beaumaris so great, that it would be folly for me to attempt it.”</p>
     <p>“What seat?” inquired Lady Beaumaris in a low voice.</p>
     <p>“Northborough,” said Endymion, “now held by Lord Montfort’s cousin, who is to come in for
      his county. The seat was offered to me, and I was told I was to be returned without
      opposition.”</p>
     <p>“Lady Montfort offered it to you?” asked Imogene.</p>
     <p>“She interested herself for me, and Lord Montfort approved the suggestion. It was described
      to me as a family seat, but when I looked into the matter, I found that Lord Beaumaris was
      more powerful than Lord Montfort.”</p>
     <p>“I thought that Lady Montfort was irresistible,” said Imogene; “she carries all before her
      in society.”</p>
     <p>“Society and politics have much to do with each other, but they are not identical. In the
      present case, Lady Montfort is powerless.”</p>
     <p>“And have you formally abandoned the seat?” inquired Lady Beaumaris.</p>
     <p>“Not formally abandoned it; that was not necessary, but I have dismissed it from my mind,
      and for some time have been trying to find another seat, but hitherto without success. In
      short, in these days it is no longer possible to step into parliament as if you were stepping
      into a club.”</p>
     <p>“If I could do anything, however little?” said Imogene. “Perhaps Lady Montfort would not
      like me to interfere?”</p>
     <p>“Why not?”</p>
     <p>“Oh! I do not know,” and then after some hesitation she added, “Is she jealous?”</p>
     <p>“Jealous! why should she be jealous?”</p>
     <p>“Perhaps she has had no cause.”</p>
     <p>“You know Lady Montfort. She is a woman of quick and brilliant feeling, the best of friends
      and a dauntless foe. Her kindness to me from the first moment I made her acquaintance has been
      inexpressible, and I sincerely believe she is most anxious to serve me. But our party is not
      very popular at present; there is no doubt the country is against us. It is tired of us. I
      feel myself the general election will be disastrous. Liberal seats are not abundant just now,
      quite the reverse, and though Lady Montfort has done more than any one could under the
      circumstances, I feel persuaded, though you think her irresistible, she will not succeed.”</p>
     <p>“I hardly know her,” said Imogene. “The world considers her irresistible, and I think you
      do. Nevertheless, I wish she could have had her way in this matter, and I think it quite a
      pity that Northborough has turned out not to be a family seat.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER II</head>
     <p>There was a dinner-party at Mr. Neuchatel’s, to which none were asked but the high
      government clique. It was the last dinner before the dissolution: “The dinner of consolation,
      or hope,” said Lord Roehampton. Lady Montfort was to be one of the guests. She was dressed,
      and her carriage in the courtyard, and she had just gone in to see her lord before she
      departed.</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort was extremely fond of jewels, and held that you could not see them to
      advantage, or fairly judge of their water or colour, except on a beautiful woman. When his
      wife was in grand toilette, and he was under the same roof, he liked her to call on him in her
      way to her carriage, that he might see her flashing rivieres and tiaras, the lustre of her
      huge pearls, and the splendour of her emeralds and sapphires and rubies.</p>
     <p>“Well, Berengaria,” he said in a playful tone, “you look divine. Never dine out again in a
      high dress. It distresses me. Bertolini was the only man who ever caught the tournure of your
      shoulders, and yet I am not altogether satisfied with his work. So, you are going to dine with
      that good Neuchatel. Remember me kindly to him. There are few men I like better. He is so
      sensible, knows so much, and so much of what is going on. I should have liked very much to
      have dined with him, but he is aware of my unfortunate state. Besides, my dear, if I were
      better I should not have enough strength for his dinners. They are really banquets; I cannot
      stand those ortolans stuffed with truffles and those truffles stuffed with ortolans. Perhaps
      he will come and dine with us some day off a joint.”</p>
     <p>“The Queen of Mesopotamia will be here next week, Simon, and we must really give her what
      you call a joint, and then we can ask the Neuchatels and a few other people.”</p>
     <p>“I was in hopes the dissolution would have carried everybody away,” said Lord Montfort
      rather woefully. “I wish the Queen of Mesopotamia were a candidate for some borough; I think
      she would rather like it.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we could not return her, Simon; do not touch on the subject. But what have you got to
      amuse to-day?”</p>
     <p>“Oh! I shall do very well. I have got the head of the French detective police to dine with
      me, and another man or two. Besides, I have got here a most amusing book, ‘Topsy Turvy;’ it
      comes out in numbers. I like books that come out in numbers, as there is a little suspense,
      and you cannot deprive yourself of all interest by glancing at the last page of the last
      volume. I think you must read ‘Topsy Turvy,’ Berengaria. I am mistaken if you do not hear of
      it. It is very cynical, which authors, who know a little of the world, are apt to be, and
      everything is exaggerated, which is another of their faults when they are only a trifle
      acquainted with manners. A little knowledge of the world is a very dangerous thing, especially
      in literature. But it is clever, and the man writes a capital style; and style is everything,
      especially in fiction.”</p>
     <p>“And what is the name of the writer, Simon?”</p>
     <p>“You never heard of it; I never did; but my secretary, who lives much in Bohemia, and is a
      member of the Cosmopolitan and knows everything, tells me he has written some things before,
      but they did not succeed. His name is St. Barbe. I should like to ask him to dinner if I knew
      how to get at him.”</p>
     <p>“Well, adieu! Simon,” and, with an agitated heart, though apparent calmness, she touched his
      forehead with her lips. “I expect an unsatisfactory dinner.”</p>
     <p>“Adieu! and if you meet poor Ferrars, which I dare say you will, tell him to keep up his
      spirits. The world is a wheel, and it will all come round right.”</p>
     <p>The dinner ought not to have been unsatisfactory, for though there was no novelty among the
      guests, they were all clever and distinguished persons and united by entire sympathy. Several
      of the ministers were there, and the Roehamptons, and Mr. Sidney Wilton, and Endymion was also
      a guest. But the general tone was a little affected and unnatural; forced gaiety, and a levity
      which displeased Lady Montfort, who fancied she was unhappy because the country was going to
      be ruined, but whose real cause of dissatisfaction at the bottom of her heart was the affair
      of “the family seat.” Her hero, Lord Roehampton, particularly did not please her to-day. She
      thought him flippant and in bad taste, merely because he would not look dismal and talk
      gloomily.</p>
     <p>“I think we shall do very well,” he said. “What cry can be better than that of ‘Cheap
      bread?’ It gives one an appetite at once.”</p>
     <p>“But the Corn-Law League says your bread will not be cheap,” said Melchior Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“I wonder whether the League has really any power in the constituencies,” said Lord
      Roehampton. “I doubt it. They may have in time, but then in the interval trade will revive. I
      have just been reading Mr. Thornberry’s speech. We shall hear more of that man. You will not
      be troubled about any of your seats?” he said, in a lower tone of sympathy, addressing Mrs.
      Neuchatel, who was his immediate neighbour.</p>
     <p>“Our seats?” said Mrs. Neuchatel, as if waking from a dream. “Oh, I know nothing about them,
      nor do I understand why there is a dissolution. I trust that parliament will not be dissolved
      without voting the money for the observation of the transit of Venus.”</p>
     <p>“I think the Roman Catholic vote will carry us through,” said a minister.</p>
     <p>“Talking of Roman Catholics,” said Mr. Wilton, “is it true that Penruddock has gone over to
      Rome?”</p>
     <p>“No truth in it,” replied a colleague. “He has gone to Rome—there is no doubt of that, and
      he has been there some time, but only for distraction. He had overworked himself.”</p>
     <p>“He might have been a Dean if he had been a practical man,” whispered Lady Montfort to Mr.
      Neuchatel, “and on the high road to a bishopric.”</p>
     <p>“That is what we want, Lady Montfort,” said Mr. Neuchatel; “we want a few practical men. If
      we had a practical man as Chancellor of the Exchequer, we should not be in the scrape in which
      we now are.”</p>
     <p>“It is not likely that Penruddock will leave the Church with a change of government possibly
      impending. We could do nothing for him with his views, but he will wait for Peel.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! Peel will never stand those high-fliers. He put the Church into a Lay Commission during
      his last government.”</p>
     <p>“Penruddock will never give up Anglicanism while there is a chance of becoming a Laud. When
      that chance vanishes, trust my word, Penruddock will make his bow to the Vatican.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I must say,” said Lord Roehampton, “if I were a clergyman I should be a Roman
      Catholic.”</p>
     <p>“Then you could not marry. What a compliment to Lady Roehampton!”</p>
     <p>“Nay; it is because I could not marry that I am not a clergyman.”</p>
     <p>Endymion had taken Adriana down to dinner. She looked very well, and was more talkative than
      usual.</p>
     <p>“I fear it will be a very great confusion—this general election,” she said. “Papa was
      telling us that you think of being a candidate.”</p>
     <p>“I am a candidate, but without a seat to captivate at present,” said Endymion; “but I am not
      without hopes of making some arrangement.”</p>
     <p>“Well, you must tell me what your colours are.”</p>
     <p>“And will you wear them?”</p>
     <p>“Most certainly; and I will work you a banner if you be victorious.”</p>
     <p>“I think I must win with such a prospect.”</p>
     <p>“I hope you will win in everything.”</p>
     <p>When the ladies retired, Berengaria came and sate by the side of Lady Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“What a dreary dinner!” she said.</p>
     <p>“Do you think so?”</p>
     <p>“Well, perhaps it was my own fault. Perhaps I am not in good cue, but everything seems to me
      to go wrong.”</p>
     <p>“Things sometimes do go wrong, but then they get right.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not think anything will ever get right with me.”</p>
     <p>“Dear Lady Montfort, how can you say such things? You who have, and have always had, the
      world at your feet—and always will have.”</p>
     <p>“I do not know what you mean by having the world at my feet. It seems to me that I have no
      power whatever—I can do nothing. I am vexed about this business of your brother. Our people
      are so stupid. They have no resource. When I go to them and ask for a seat, I expect a seat,
      as I would a shawl at Howell and James’ if I asked for one. Instead of that they only make
      difficulties. What our party wants is a Mr. Tadpole; he out-manoeuvres them in every
      corner.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I shall be deeply disappointed—deeply pained,” said Lady Roehampton, “if Endymion is
      not in this parliament, but if we fail I will not utterly despair. I will continue to do what
      I have done all my life, exert my utmost will and power to advance him.”</p>
     <p>“I thought I had will and power,” said Lady Montfort, “but the conceit is taken out of me.
      Your brother was to me a source of great interest, from the first moment that I knew him. His
      future was an object in life, and I thought I could mould it. What a mistake! Instead of
      making his fortune I have only dissipated his life.”</p>
     <p>“You have been to him the kindest and the most valuable of friends, and he feels it.”</p>
     <p>“It is no use being kind, and I am valuable to no one. I often think if I disappeared
      to-morrow no one would miss me.”</p>
     <p>“You are in a morbid mood, dear lady. To-morrow perhaps everything will be right, and then
      you will feel that you are surrounded by devoted friends, and by a husband who adores
      you.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort gave a scrutinising glance at Lady Roehampton as she said this, then shook her
      head. “Ah! there it is, dear Myra. You judge from your own happiness; you do not know Lord
      Montfort. You know how I love him, but I am perfectly convinced he prefers my letters to my
      society.”</p>
     <p>“You see what it is to be a Madame de Sevigne,” said Lady Roehampton, trying to give a
      playful tone to the conversation.</p>
     <p>“You jest,” said Lady Montfort; “I am quite serious. No one can deceive me; would that they
      could! I have the fatal gift of reading persons, and penetrating motives, however deep or
      complicated their character, and what I tell you about Lord Montfort is unhappily too
      true.”</p>
     <p>In the meantime, while this interesting conversation was taking place, the gentleman who had
      been the object of Lady Montfort’s eulogium, the gentleman who always out-manoeuvred her
      friends at every corner, was, though it was approaching midnight, walking up and down Carlton
      Terrace with an agitated and indignant countenance, and not alone.</p>
     <p>“I tell you, Mr. Waldershare, I know it; I have it almost from Lord Beaumaris himself; he
      has declined to support our man, and no doubt will give his influence to the enemy.”</p>
     <p>“I do not believe that Lord Beaumaris has made any engagement whatever.”</p>
     <p>“A pretty state of affairs!” exclaimed Mr. Tadpole. “I do not know what the world has come
      to. Here are gentlemen expecting high places in the Household, and under-secretaryships of
      state, and actually giving away our seats to our opponents.”</p>
     <p>“There is some family engagement about this seat between the Houses of Beaumaris and
      Montfort, and Lord Beaumaris, who is a young man, and who does not know as much about these
      things as you and I do, naturally wants not to make a mistake. But he has promised nothing and
      nobody. I know, I might almost say I saw the letter, that he wrote to Lord Montfort this day,
      asking for an interview to-morrow morning on the matter, and Lord Montfort has given him an
      appointment for to-morrow. This I know.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I must leave it to you,” said Mr. Tadpole. “You must remember what we are fighting
      for. The constitution is at stake.”</p>
     <p>“And the Church,” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“And the landed interest, you may rely upon it,” said Mr. Tadpole.</p>
     <p>“And your Lordship of the Treasury <hi>in posse</hi>, Tadpole. Truly it is a great
      stake.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER III</head>
     <p>The interview between the heads of the two great houses of Montfort and Beaumaris, on which
      the fate of a ministry might depend, for it should always be recollected that it was only by a
      majority of one that Sir Robert Peel had necessitated the dissolution of parliament, was not
      carried on exactly in the spirit and with the means which would have occurred to and been
      practised by the race of Tadpoles and Tapers.</p>
     <p>Lord Beaumaris was a very young man, handsome, extremely shy, and one who had only very
      recently mixed with the circle in which he was born. It was under the influence of Imogene
      that, in soliciting an interview with Lord Montfort, he had taken for him an unusual, not to
      say unprecedented step. He had conjured up to himself in Lord Montfort the apparition of a
      haughty Whig peer, proud of his order, prouder of his party, and not over-prejudiced in favour
      of one who had quitted those sacred ranks, freezing with arrogant reserve and condescending
      politeness. In short, Lord Beaumaris was extremely nervous when, ushered by many servants
      through many chambers, there came forward to receive him the most sweetly mannered gentleman
      alive, who not only gave him his hand, but retained his guest’s, saying, “We are a sort of
      cousins, I believe, and ought to have been acquainted before, but you know perhaps my wretched
      state,” though what that was nobody exactly did know, particularly as Lord Montfort was
      sometimes seen wading in streams breast-high while throwing his skilful line over the rushing
      waters. “I remember your grandfather,” he said, “and with good cause. He pouched me at Harrow,
      and it was the largest pouch I ever had. One does not forget the first time one had a
      five-pound note.”</p>
     <p>And then when Lord Beaumaris, blushing and with much hesitation, had stated the occasion of
      his asking for the interview that they might settle together about the representation of
      Northborough in harmony with the old understanding between the families which he trusted would
      always be maintained, Lord Montfort assured him that he was personally obliged to him by his
      always supporting Odo, regretted that Odo would retire, and then said if Lord Beaumaris had
      any brother, cousin, or friend to bring forward, he need hardly say Lord Beaumaris might count
      upon him. “I am a Whig,” he continued, “and so was your father, but I am not particularly
      pleased with the sayings and doings of my people. Between ourselves, I think they have been in
      a little too long, and if they do anything very strong, if, for instance, they give office to
      O’Connell, I should not be at all surprised if I were myself to sit on the cross benches.”</p>
     <p>It seems there was no member of the Beaumaris family who wished at this juncture to come
      forward, and being assured of this, Lord Montfort remarked there was a young man of promise
      who much wished to enter the House of Commons, not unknown, he believed, to Lord Beaumaris,
      and that was Mr. Ferrars. He was the son of a distinguished man, now departed, who in his day
      had been a minister of state. Lord Montfort was quite ready to support Mr. Ferrars, if Lord
      Beaumaris approved of the selection, but he placed himself entirely in his hands.</p>
     <p>Lord Beaumaris, blushing, said he quite approved of the selection; knew Mr. Ferrars very
      well, and liked him very much; and if Lord Montfort sanctioned it, would speak to Mr. Ferrars
      himself. He believed Mr. Ferrars was a Liberal, but he agreed with Lord Montfort, that in
      these days gentlemen must be all of the same opinion if not on the same side, and so on. And
      then they talked of fishing appropriately to a book of very curious flies that was on the
      table, and they agreed if possible to fish together in some famous waters that Lord Beaumaris
      had in Hampshire, and then, as he was saying farewell, Lord Montfort added, “Although I never
      pay visits, because really in my wretched state I cannot, there is no reason why our wives
      should not know each other. Will you permit Lady Montfort to have the honour of paying her
      respects to Lady Beaumaris?”</p>
     <p>Talleyrand or Metternich could not have conducted an interview more skilfully. But these
      were just the things that Lord Montfort did not dislike doing. His great good nature was not
      disturbed by a single inconvenient circumstance, and he enjoyed the sense of his
      adroitness.</p>
     <p>The same day the cards of Lord and Lady Montfort were sent to Piccadilly Terrace, and on the
      next day the cards of Lord and Lady Beaumaris were returned to Montfort House. And on the
      following day, Lady Montfort, accompanied by Lady Roehampton, would find Lady Beaumaris at
      home, and after a charming visit, in which Lady Montfort, though natural to the last degree,
      displayed every quality which could fascinate even a woman, when she put her hand in that of
      Imogene to say farewell, added, “I am delighted to find that we are cousins.”</p>
     <p>A few days after this interview, parliament was dissolved. It was the middle of a wet June,
      and the season received its <hi>coup de grace</hi>. Although Endymion had no rival, and
      apparently no prospect of a contest, his labours as a candidate were not slight. The
      constituency was numerous, and every member of it expected to be called upon. To each Mr.
      Ferrars had to expound his political views, and to receive from each a cordial assurance of a
      churlish criticism. All this he did and endured, accompanied by about fifty of the principal
      inhabitants, members of his committee, who insisted on never leaving his side, and prompting
      him at every new door which he entered with contradictory reports of the political opinions of
      the indweller, or confidential informations how they were to be managed and addressed.</p>
     <p>The principal and most laborious incidents of the day were festivals which they styled
      luncheons, when the candidate and the ambulatory committee were quartered on some principal
      citizen with an elaborate banquet of several courses, and in which Mr. Ferrars’ health was
      always pledged in sparkling bumpers. After the luncheon came two or three more hours of what
      was called canvassing; then, in a state of horrible repletion, the fortunate candidate, who
      had no contest, had to dine with another principal citizen, with real turtle soup, and
      gigantic turbots, <hi>entrees</hi> in the shape of volcanic curries, and rigid venison, sent
      as a compliment by a neighbouring peer. This last ceremony was necessarily hurried, as
      Endymion had every night to address in some ward a body of the electors.</p>
     <p>When this had been going on for a few days, the borough was suddenly placarded with posting
      bills in colossal characters of true blue, warning the Conservative electors not to promise
      their votes, as a distinguished candidate of the right sort would certainly come forward. At
      the same time there was a paragraph in a local journal that a member of a noble family,
      illustrious in the naval annals of the country, would, if sufficiently supported, solicit the
      suffrages of the independent electors.</p>
     <p>“We think, by the allusion to the navy, that it must be Mr. Hood of Acreley,” said Lord
      Beaumaris’ agent to Mr. Ferrars, “but he has not the ghost of a chance. I will ride over and
      see him in the course of the day.”</p>
     <p>This placard was of course Mr. Tadpole’s last effort, but that worthy gentleman soon forgot
      his mortification about Northborough in the general triumph of his party. The Whigs were
      nowhere, though Mr. Ferrars was returned without opposition, and in the month of August, still
      wondering at the rapid, strange, and even mysterious incidents, that had so suddenly and so
      swiftly changed his position and prospects in life, took his seat in that House in whose
      galleries he had so long humbly attended as the private secretary of a cabinet minister.</p>
     <p>His friends were still in office, though the country had sent up a majority of ninety
      against them, and Endymion took his seat behind the Treasury bench, and exactly behind Lord
      Roehampton. The debate on the address was protracted for three nights, and then they divided
      at three o’clock in the morning, and then all was over. Lord Roehampton, who had vindicated
      the ministry with admirable vigour and felicity, turned round to Endymion, and smiling said in
      the sweetest tone, “I did not enlarge on our greatest feat, namely, that we had governed the
      country for two years without a majority. Peel would never have had the pluck to do that.”</p>
     <p>Notwithstanding the backsliding of Lord Beaumaris and the unprincipled conduct of Mr.
      Waldershare, they were both rewarded as the latter gentleman projected—Lord Beaumaris accepted
      a high post in the Household, and Mr. Waldershare was appointed Under-Secretary of State for
      Foreign Affairs. Tadpole was a little glum about it, but it was inevitable. “The fact is,” as
      the world agreed, “Lady Beaumaris is the only Tory woman. They have nobody who can receive
      except her.”</p>
     <p>The changes in the House of Commons were still greater than those in the administration.
      Never were so many new members, and Endymion watched them, during the first days, and before
      the debate on the address, taking the oaths at the table in batches with much interest. Mr.
      Bertie Tremaine was returned, and his brother, Mr. Tremaine Bertie. Job Thornberry was member
      for a manufacturing town, with which he was not otherwise connected. Hortensius was
      successful, and Mr. Vigo for a metropolitan borough, but what pleased Endymion more than
      anything was the return of his valued friend Trenchard, who a short time before had acceded to
      the paternal estate; all these gentlemen were Liberals, and were destined to sit on the same
      side of the House as Endymion.</p>
     <p>After the fatal vote, the Whigs all left town. Society in general had been greatly
      dispersed, but parliament had to remain sitting until October.</p>
     <p>“We are going to Princedown,” Lady Montfort said one day to Endymion, “and we had counted on
      seeing you there, but I have been thinking much of your position since, and I am persuaded,
      that we must sacrifice pleasure to higher objects. This is really a crisis in your life, and
      much, perhaps everything, depends on your not making a mistake now. What I want to see you is
      a great statesman. This is a political economy parliament, both sides alike thinking of the
      price of corn and all that. Finance and commerce are everybody’s subjects, and are most
      convenient to make speeches about for men who cannot speak French and who have had no
      education. Real politics are the possession and distribution of power. I want to see you give
      your mind to foreign affairs. There you will have no rivals. There are a great many subjects
      which Lord Roehampton cannot take up, but which you could very properly, and you will have
      always the benefit of his counsel, and, when necessary, his parliamentary assistance; but
      foreign affairs are not to be mastered by mere reading. Bookworms do not make chancellors of
      state. You must become acquainted with the great actors in the great scene. There is nothing
      like personal knowledge of the individuals who control the high affairs. That has made the
      fortune of Lord Roehampton. What I think you ought to do, without doubt ought to do, is to
      take advantage of this long interval before the meeting of parliament, and go to Paris. Paris
      is now the Capital of Diplomacy. It is not the best time of the year to go there, but you will
      meet a great many people of the diplomatic world, and if the opportunity offers, you can vary
      the scene, and go to some baths which princes and ministers frequent. The Count of Ferroll is
      now at Paris, and minister for his court. You know him; that is well. But he is my greatest
      friend, and, as you know, we habitually correspond. He will do everything for you, I am sure,
      for my sake. It is not pleasant to be separated; I do not wish to conceal that; I should have
      enjoyed your society at Princedown, but I am doing right, and you will some day thank me for
      it. We must soften the pang of separation by writing to each other every day, so when we meet
      again it will only be as if we had parted yesterday. Besides—who knows?—I may run over myself
      to Paris in the winter. My lord always liked Paris; the only place he ever did, but I am not
      very sanguine he will go; he is so afraid of being asked to dinner by our ambassador.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
     <p>In all lives, the highest and the humblest, there is a crisis in the formation of character,
      and in the bent of the disposition. It comes from many causes, and from some which on the
      surface are apparently even trivial. It may be a book, a speech, a sermon; a man or a woman; a
      great misfortune or a burst of prosperity. But the result is the same; a sudden revelation to
      ourselves of our secret purpose, and a recognition of our perhaps long shadowed, but now
      masterful convictions.</p>
     <p>A crisis of this kind occurred to Endymion the day when he returned to his chambers, after
      having taken the oaths and his seat in the House of Commons. He felt the necessity of being
      alone. For nearly the last three months he had been the excited actor in a strange and even
      mysterious drama. There had been for him no time to reflect; all he could aim at was to
      comprehend, and if possible control, the present and urgent contingency; he had been called
      upon, almost unceasingly, to do or to say something sudden and unexpected; and it was only
      now, when the crest of the ascent had been reached, that he could look around him and consider
      the new world opening to his gaze.</p>
     <p>The greatest opportunity that can be offered to an Englishman was now his—a seat in the
      House of Commons. It was his almost in the first bloom of youth, and yet after advantageous
      years of labour and political training, and it was combined with a material independence on
      which he never could have counted. A love of power, a passion for distinction, a noble pride,
      which had been native to his early disposition, but which had apparently been crushed by the
      enormous sorrows and misfortunes of his childhood, and which had vanished, as it were, before
      the sweetness of that domestic love which had been the solace of his adversity, now again
      stirred their dim and mighty forms in his renovated, and, as it were, inspired consciousness.
      “If this has happened at twenty-two,” thought Endymion, “what may not occur if the average
      life of man be allotted to me? At any rate, I will never think of anything else. I have a
      purpose in life, and I will fulfil it. It is a charm that its accomplishment would be the most
      grateful result to the two beings I most love in the world.”</p>
     <p>So when Lady Montfort shortly after opened her views to Endymion as to his visiting Paris,
      and his purpose in so doing, the seeds were thrown on a willing soil, and he embraced her
      counsels with the deepest interest. His intimacy with the Count of Ferroll was the completing
      event of this epoch of his life.</p>
     <p>Their acquaintance had been slight in England, for after the Montfort Tournament the Count
      had been appointed to Paris, where he was required; but he received Endymion with a cordiality
      which contrasted with his usual demeanour, which, though frank, was somewhat cynical.</p>
     <p>“This is not a favourable time to visit Paris,” he said, “so far as society is concerned.
      There is some business stirring in the diplomatic world, which has re-assembled the fraternity
      for the moment, and the King is at St. Cloud, but you may make some acquaintances which may be
      desirable, and at any rate look about you and clear the ground for the coming season. I do not
      despair of our dear friend coming over in the winter. It is one of the hopes that keep me
      alive. What a woman! You may count yourself fortunate in having such a friend. I do. I am not
      particularly fond of female society. Women chatter too much. But I prefer the society of a
      first-rate woman to that of any man; and Lady Montfort is a first-rate woman—I think the
      greatest since Louise of Savoy; infinitely beyond the Princess d’Ursins.”</p>
     <p>The “business that was then stirring in the diplomatic world,” at a season when the
      pleasures of Parisian society could not distract him, gave Endymion a rare opportunity of
      studying that singular class of human beings which is accustomed to consider states and
      nations as individuals, and speculate on their quarrels and misunderstandings, and the
      remedies which they require, in a tongue peculiar to themselves, and in language which often
      conveys a meaning exactly opposite to that which it seems to express. Diplomacy is hospitable,
      and a young Englishman of graceful mien, well introduced, and a member of the House of
      Commons—that awful assembly which produces those dreaded blue books which strike terror in the
      boldest of foreign statesmen—was not only received, but courted, in the interesting circle in
      which Endymion found himself.</p>
     <p>There he encountered men grey with the fame and wisdom of half a century of deep and lofty
      action, men who had struggled with the first Napoleon, and had sat in the Congress of Vienna;
      others, hardly less celebrated, who had been suddenly borne to high places by the
      revolutionary wave of 1830, and who had justly retained their exalted posts when so many
      competitors with an equal chance had long ago, with equal justice, subsided into the obscurity
      from which they ought never to have emerged. Around these chief personages were others not
      less distinguished by their abilities, but a more youthful generation, who knew how to wait,
      and were always prepared or preparing for the inevitable occasion when it arrived—fine and
      trained writers, who could interpret in sentences of graceful adroitness the views of their
      chiefs; or sages in precedents, walking dictionaries of diplomacy, and masters of every
      treaty; and private secretaries reading human nature at a glance, and collecting every shade
      of opinion for the use and guidance of their principals.</p>
     <p>Whatever their controversies in the morning, their critical interviews and their secret
      alliances, all were smiles and graceful badinage at the banquet and the reception; as if they
      had only come to Paris to show their brilliant uniforms, their golden fleeces, and their grand
      crosses, and their broad ribbons with more tints than the iris.</p>
     <p>“I will not give them ten years,” said the Count of Ferroll, lighting his cigarette, and
      addressing Endymion on their return from one of these assemblies; “I sometimes think hardly
      five.”</p>
     <p>“But where will the blow come from?”</p>
     <p>“Here; there is no movement in Europe except in France, and here it will always be a
      movement of subversion.”</p>
     <p>“A pretty prospect!”</p>
     <p>“The sooner you realise it the better. The system here is supported by journalists and
      bankers; two influential classes, but the millions care for neither; rather, I should say,
      dislike both.”</p>
     <p>“Will the change affect Europe?”</p>
     <p>“Inevitably. You rightly say Europe, for that is a geographical expression. There is no
      State in Europe; I exclude your own country, which belongs to every division of the globe, and
      is fast becoming more commercial than political, and I exclude Russia, for she is essentially
      oriental, and her future will be entirely the East.”</p>
     <p>“But there is Germany!”</p>
     <p>“Where? I cannot find it on the maps. Germany is divided into various districts, and when
      there is a war, they are ranged on different sides. Notwithstanding our reviews and annual
      encampments, Germany is practically as weak as Italy. We have some kingdoms who are allowed to
      play at being first-rate powers; but it is mere play. They no more command events than the
      King of Naples or the Duke of Modena.”</p>
     <p>“Then is France periodically to overrun Europe?”</p>
     <p>“So long as it continues to be merely Europe.”</p>
     <p>A close intimacy occurred between Endymion and the Count of Ferroll. He not only became a
      permanent guest at the official residence, but when the Conference broke up, the Count invited
      Endymion to be his companion to some celebrated baths, where they would meet not only many of
      his late distinguished colleagues, but their imperial and royal masters, seeking alike health
      and relaxation at this famous rendezvous.</p>
     <p>“You will find it of the first importance in public life,” said the Count of Ferroll, “to
      know personally those who are carrying on the business of the world; so much depends on the
      character of an individual, his habits of thought, his prejudices, his superstitions, his
      social weaknesses, his health. Conducting affairs without this advantage is, in effect, an
      affair of stationery; it is pens and paper who are in communication, not human beings.”</p>
     <p>The brother-in-law of Lord Roehampton was a sort of personage. It was very true that
      distinguished man was no longer minister, but he had been minister for a long time, and had
      left a great name. Foreigners rarely know more than one English minister at a time, but they
      compensated for their ignorance of the aggregate body by even exaggerating the qualities of
      the individual with whom they are acquainted. Lord Roehampton had conducted the affairs of his
      country always in a courteous, but still in a somewhat haughty spirit. He was easy and
      obliging, and conciliatory in little matters, but where the credit, or honour, or large
      interests of England were concerned, he acted with conscious authority. On the continent of
      Europe, though he sometimes incurred the depreciation of the smaller minds, whose self-love he
      may not have sufficiently spared, by the higher spirits he was feared and admired, and they
      knew, when he gave his whole soul to an affair, that they were dealing with a master.</p>
     <p>Endymion was presented to emperors and kings, and he made his way with these exalted
      personages. He found them different from what he had expected. He was struck by their intimate
      acquaintance with affairs, and by the serenity of their judgment. The life was a pleasant as
      well as an interesting one. Where there are crowned heads, there are always some charming
      women. Endymion found himself in a delightful circle. Long days and early hours, and a
      beautiful country, renovate the spirit as well as the physical frame. Excursions to romantic
      forests, and visits to picturesque ruins, in the noon of summer, are enchanting, especially
      with princesses for your companions, bright and accomplished. Yet, notwithstanding some
      distractions, Endymion never omitted writing to Lady Montfort every day.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER V</head>
     <p>The season at Paris, which commenced towards the end of the year, was a lively one, and
      especially interesting to Endymion, who met there a great many of his friends. After his visit
      to the baths he had travelled alone for a few weeks, and saw some famous places of which he
      had long heard. A poet was then sitting on the throne of Bavaria, and was realising his dreams
      in the creation of an ideal capital. The Black Forest is a land of romance. He saw Walhalla,
      too, crowning the Danube with the genius of Germany, as mighty as the stream itself. Pleasant
      it is to wander among the quaint cities here clustering together: Nuremberg with all its
      ancient art, imperial Augsburg, and Wurzburg with its priestly palace, beyond the splendour of
      many kings. A summer in Suabia is a great joy.</p>
     <p>But what a contrast to the Rue de la Paix, bright and vivacious, in which he now finds
      himself, and the companion of the Neuchatel family! Endymion had only returned to Paris the
      previous evening, and the Neuchatels had preceded him by a week; so they had seen everybody
      and could tell him everything. Lord and Lady Beaumaris were there, and Mrs. Rodney their
      companion, her husband detained in London by some mysterious business; it was thought a seat
      in parliament, which Mr. Tadpole had persuaded him might be secured on a vacancy occasioned by
      a successful petition. They had seen the Count of Ferroll, who was going to dine with them
      that day, and Endymion was invited to meet him. It was Adriana’s first visit to Paris, and she
      seemed delighted with it; but Mrs. Neuchatel preferred the gay capital when it was out of
      season. Mr. Neuchatel himself was always in high spirits,—sanguine and self-satisfied. He was
      an Orleanist, had always been so, and sympathised with the apparently complete triumph of his
      principles—“real liberal principles, no nonsense; there was more gold in the Bank of France
      than in any similar establishment in Europe. After all, wealth is the test of the welfare of a
      people, and the test of wealth is the command of the precious metals. Eh! Mr. Member of
      Parliament?” And his eye flashed fire, and he seemed to smack his lips at the very thought and
      mention of these delicious circumstances.</p>
     <p>They were in a jeweller’s shop, and Mrs. Neuchatel was choosing a trinket for a wedding
      present. She seemed infinitely distressed. “What do you think of this, Adriana? It is simple
      and in good taste. I should like it for myself, and yet I fear it might not be thought fine
      enough.”</p>
     <p>“This is pretty, mamma, and new,” and she held before her mother a bracelet of much
      splendour.</p>
     <p>“Oh, no! that will never do, dear Adriana; they will say we are purse-proud.”</p>
     <p>“I am afraid they will always say that, mamma,” and she sighed.</p>
     <p>“It is a long time since we all separated,” said Endymion to Adriana.</p>
     <p>“Months! Mr. Sidney Wilton said you were the first runaway. I think you were quite right.
      Your new life now will be fresh to you. If you had remained, it would only have been
      associated with defeat and discomfiture.”</p>
     <p>“I am so happy to be in parliament, that I do not think I could ever associate such a life
      with discomfiture.”</p>
     <p>“Does it make you very happy?” said Adriana, looking at him rather earnestly.</p>
     <p>“Very happy.”</p>
     <p>“I am glad of that.”</p>
     <p>The Neuchatels had a house at Paris—one of the fine hotels of the First Empire. It was
      inhabited generally by one of the nephews, but it was always ready to receive them with every
      luxury and every comfort. But Mrs. Neuchatel herself particularly disliked Paris, and she
      rarely accompanied her husband in his frequent but brief visits to the gay city. She had
      yielded on this occasion to the wish of Adriana, whom she had endeavoured to bring up in a
      wholesome prejudice against French taste and fashions.</p>
     <p>The dinner to-day was exquisite, in a chamber of many-coloured marbles, and where there was
      no marble there was gold, and when the banquet was over, they repaired to saloons hung with
      satin of a delicate tint which exhibited to perfection a choice collection of Greuse and
      Vanloo. Mr. Sidney Wilton dined there as well as the Count of Ferroll, some of the French
      ministers, and two or three illustrious Orleanist celebrities of literature, who acknowledged
      and emulated the matchless conversational powers of Mrs. Neuchatel. Lord and Lady Beaumaris
      and Mrs. Rodney completed the party.</p>
     <p>Sylvia was really peerless. She was by birth half a Frenchwoman, and she compensated for her
      deficiency in the other moiety, by a series of exquisite costumes, in which she mingled with
      the spell-born fashion of France her own singular genius in dress. She spoke not much, but
      looked prettier than ever; a little haughty, and now and then faintly smiling. What was most
      remarkable about her was her convenient and complete want of memory. Sylvia had no past. She
      could not have found her way to Warwick Street to save her life. She conversed with Endymion
      with ease and not without gratification, but from all she said, you might have supposed that
      they had been born in the same sphere, and always lived in the same sphere, that sphere being
      one peopled by duchesses and countesses and gentlemen of fashion and ministers of state.</p>
     <p>Lady Beaumaris was different from her sister almost in all respects, except in beauty,
      though her beauty even was of a higher style than that of Mrs. Rodney. Imogene was quite
      natural, though refined. She had a fine disposition. All her impulses were good and naturally
      noble. She had a greater intellectual range than Sylvia, and was much more cultivated. This
      she owed to her friendship with Mr. Waldershare, who was entirely devoted to her, and whose
      main object in life was to make everything contribute to her greatness. “I hope he will come
      here next week,” she said to Endymion. “I heard from him to-day. He is at Venice. And he gives
      me such lovely descriptions of that city, that I shall never rest till I have seen it and
      glided in a gondola.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that you can easily do.”</p>
     <p>“Not so easily. It will never do to interfere with my lord’s hunting—and when hunting is
      over there is always something else—Newmarket, or the House of Lords, or rook-shooting.”</p>
     <p>“I must say there is something delightful about Paris, which you meet nowhere else,” said
      Mr. Sidney Wilton to Endymion. “For my part, it has the same effect on me as a bottle of
      champagne. When I think of what we were doing at this time last year—those dreadful November
      cabinets—I shudder! By the by, the Count of Ferroll says there is a chance of Lady Montfort
      coming here; have you heard anything?”</p>
     <p>Endymion knew all about it, but he was too discreet even to pretend to exclusive information
      on that head. He thought it might be true, but supposed it depended on my lord.</p>
     <p>“Oh! Montfort will never come. He will bolt at the last moment when the hall is full of
      packages. Their very sight will frighten him, and he will steal down to Princedown and read
      ‘Don Quixote.’”</p>
     <p>Sidney Wilton was quite right. Lady Montfort arrived without her lord. “He threw me over
      almost as we were getting into the carriage, and I had quite given it up when dear Lady
      Roehampton came to my rescue. She wanted to see her brother, and—here we are.”</p>
     <p>The arrival of these two great ladies gave a stimulant to gaieties which were already
      excessive. The court and the ministers rivalled the balls and the banquets which were
      profusely offered by the ambassadors and bankers. Even the great faubourg relaxed, and its
      halls of high ceremony and mysterious splendour were opened to those who in London had
      extended to many of their order a graceful and abounding hospitality. It was with difficulty,
      however, that they persuaded Lady Montfort to honour with her presence the embassy of her own
      court.</p>
     <p>“I dined with those people once,” she said to Endymion, “but I confess when I thought of
      those dear Granvilles, their <hi>entrees</hi> stuck in my throat.”</p>
     <p>There was, however, no lack of diplomatic banquets for the successor of Louise of Savoy. The
      splendid hotel of the Count of Ferroll was the scene of festivals not to be exceeded in Paris,
      and all in honour of this wondrous dame. Sometimes they were feasts, sometimes they were
      balls, sometimes they were little dinners, consummate and select, sometimes large receptions,
      multifarious and amusing. Her pleasure was asked every morn, and whenever she was disengaged,
      she issued orders to his devoted household. His boxes at opera or play were at her constant
      disposal; his carriages were at her command, and she rode, in his society, the most beautiful
      horses in Paris.</p>
     <p>The Count of Ferroll had wished that both ladies should have taken up their residence at his
      mansion.</p>
     <p>“But I think we had better not,” said Lady Montfort to Myra. “After all, there is nothing
      like ‘my crust of bread and liberty,’ and so I think we had better stay at the Bristol.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
     <p>“Go and talk to Adriana,” said Lady Roehampton to her brother. “It seems to me you never
      speak to her.”</p>
     <p>Endymion looked a little confused.</p>
     <p>“Lady Montfort has plenty of friends here,” his sister continued. “You are not wanted, and
      you should always remember those who have been our earliest and kindest friends.”</p>
     <p>There was something in Lady Roehampton’s words and look which rather jarred upon him.
      Anything like reproach or dissatisfaction from those lips and from that countenance, sometimes
      a little anxious but always affectionate, not to say adoring, confused and even agitated him.
      He was tempted to reply, but, exercising successfully the self-control which was the result
      rather of his life than of his nature, he said nothing, and, in obedience to the intimation,
      immediately approached Miss Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>About this time Waldershare arrived at Paris, full of magnificent dreams which he called
      plans. He was delighted with his office; it was much the most important in the government, and
      more important because it was not in the cabinet. Well managed, it was power without
      responsibility. He explained to Lady Beaumaris that an Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
      Affairs, with his chief in the House of Lords, was “master of the situation.” What the
      situation was, and what the under-secretary was to master, he did not yet deign to inform
      Imogene; but her trust in Waldershare was implicit, and she repeated to Lord Beaumaris, and to
      Mrs. Rodney, with an air of mysterious self-complacency, that Mr. Waldershare was “master of
      the situation.” Mrs. Rodney fancied that this was the correct and fashionable title of an
      under-secretary of state. Mr. Waldershare was going to make a collection of portraits of
      Under-Secretaries for Foreign Affairs whose chiefs had been in the House of Lords. It would be
      a collection of the most eminent statesmen that England had ever produced. For the rest,
      during his Italian tour, Waldershare seemed to have conducted himself with distinguished
      discretion, and had been careful not to solicit an audience of the Duke of Modena in order to
      renew his oath of allegiance.</p>
     <p>When Lady Montfort successfully tempted Lady Roehampton to be her travelling companion to
      Paris, the contemplated visit was to have been a short one—“a week, perhaps ten days at the
      outside.” The outside had been not inconsiderably passed, and yet the beautiful Berengaria
      showed no disposition of returning to England. Myra was uneasy at her own protracted absence
      from her lord, and having made a last, but fruitless effort to induce Lady Montfort to
      accompany her, she said one day to Endymion, “I think I must ask you to take me back. And
      indeed you ought to be with my lord some little time before the meeting of Parliament.”</p>
     <p>Endymion was really of the same opinion, though he was conscious of the social difficulty
      which he should have to encounter in order to effect his purpose. Occasionally a statesman in
      opposition is assisted by the same private secretary who was his confidant when in office; but
      this is not always the case—perhaps not even generally. In the present instance, the principal
      of Lord Roehampton’s several secretaries had been selected from the permanent clerks in the
      Foreign Office itself, and therefore when his chief retired from his official duties, the
      private secretary resumed his previous post, an act which necessarily terminated all relations
      between himself and the late minister, save those of private, though often still intimate,
      acquaintance.</p>
     <p>Now one of the great objects of Lady Roehampton for a long time had been, that her brother
      should occupy a confidential position near her husband. The desire had originally been shared,
      and even warmly, by Lady Montfort; but the unexpected entrance of Endymion into the House of
      Commons had raised a technical difficulty in this respect which seemed to terminate the
      cherished prospect. Myra, however, was resolved not to regard these technical difficulties,
      and was determined to establish at once the intimate relations she desired between her husband
      and her brother. This purpose had been one of the principal causes which induced her to
      accompany Lady Montfort to Paris. She wanted to see Endymion, to see what he was about, and to
      prepare him for the future which she contemplated.</p>
     <p>The view which Lady Montfort took of these matters was very different from that of Lady
      Roehampton. Lady Montfort was in her riding habit, leaning back in an easy chair, with her
      whip in one hand and the “Charivari” in the other, and she said, “Are you not going to ride
      to-day, Endymion?”</p>
     <p>“I think not. I wanted to talk to you a little about my plans, Lady Montfort.”</p>
     <p>“Your plans? Why should you have any plans?”</p>
     <p>“Well, Lady Roehampton is about to return to England, and she proposes I should go with
      her.”</p>
     <p>“Why?”</p>
     <p>And then Endymion entered into the whole case, the desirableness of being with Lord
      Roehampton before the meeting of parliament, of assisting him, working with him, acting for
      him, and all the other expedient circumstances of the situation.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort said nothing. Being of an eager nature, it was rather her habit to interrupt
      those who addressed her, especially on matters she deemed disagreeable. Her husband used to
      say, “Berengaria is a charming companion, but if she would only listen a little more, she
      would have so much more to tell me.” On the present occasion, Endymion had no reason to
      complain that he had not a fair opportunity of stating his views and wishes. She was quite
      silent, changed colour occasionally, bit her beautiful lip, and gently but constantly lashed
      her beautiful riding habit. When he paused, she inquired if he had done, and he assenting, she
      said, “I think the whole thing preposterous. What can Lord Roehampton have to do before the
      meeting of parliament? He has not got to write the Queen’s speech. The only use of being in
      opposition is that we may enjoy ourselves. The best thing that Lord Roehampton and all his
      friends can do is travel for a couple of years. Ask the Count of Ferroll what he thinks of the
      situation. He will tell you that he never knew one more hopeless. Taxes and tariffs—that’s the
      future of England, and, so far as I can see, it may go on for ever. The government here
      desires nothing better than what they call Peace. What they mean by peace is agiotage, shares
      at a premium, and bubble companies. The whole thing is corrupt, as it ever must be when
      government is in the hands of a mere middle class, and that, too, a limited one; but it may
      last hopelessly long, and in the meantime, ‘Vive la bagatelle!’”</p>
     <p>“These are very different views from those which, I had understood, were to guide us in
      opposition,” said Endymion, amazed.</p>
     <p>“There is no opposition,” rejoined Lady Montfort, somewhat tartly. “For a real opposition
      there must be a great policy. If your friend, Lord Roehampton, when he was settling the
      Levant, had only seized upon Egypt, we should have been somewhere. Now, we are the party who
      wanted to give, not even cheap bread to the people, but only cheaper bread. Faugh!”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not think the occupation of Egypt in the present state of our finances”——</p>
     <p>“Do not talk to me about ‘the present state of our finances.’ You are worse than Mr. Sidney
      Wilton. The Count of Ferroll says that a ministry which is upset by its finances must be
      essentially imbecile. And that, too, in England—the richest country in the world!”</p>
     <p>“Well, I think the state of the finances had something to do with the French Revolution,”
      observed Endymion quietly.</p>
     <p>“The French Revolution! You might as well talk of the fall of the Roman Empire. The French
      Revolution was founded on nonsense—on the rights of man; when all sensible people in every
      country are now agreed, that man has no rights whatever.”</p>
     <p>“But, dearest Lady Montfort,” said Endymion, in a somewhat deprecating tone, “about my
      returning; for that is the real subject on which I wished to trouble you.”</p>
     <p>“You have made up your mind to return,” she replied. “What is the use of consulting me with
      a foregone conclusion? I suppose you think it a compliment.”</p>
     <p>“I should be very sorry to do anything without consulting you,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“The worst person in the world to consult,” said Lady Montfort impatiently. “If you want
      advice, you had better go to your sister. Men who are guided by their sisters seldom make very
      great mistakes. They are generally so prudent; and, I must say, I think a prudent man quite
      detestable.”</p>
     <p>Endymion turned pale, his lips quivered. What might have been the winged words they sent
      forth it is now impossible to record, for at that moment the door opened, and the servant
      announced that her ladyship’s horse was at the door. Lady Montfort jumped up quickly, and
      saying, “Well, I suppose I shall see you before you go,” disappeared.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
     <p>In the meantime, Lady Roehampton was paying her farewell visit to her former pupil. They
      were alone, and Adriana was hanging on her neck and weeping.</p>
     <p>“We were so happy,” she murmured.</p>
     <p>“And are so happy, and will be,” said Myra.</p>
     <p>“I feel I shall never be happy again,” sighed Adriana.</p>
     <p>“You deserve to be the happiest of human beings, and you will be.”</p>
     <p>“Never, never!”</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton could say no more; she pressed her friend to her heart, and left the room in
      silence.</p>
     <p>When she arrived at her hotel, her brother was leaving the house. His countenance was
      disquieted; he did not greet her with that mantling sunniness of aspect which was natural to
      him when they met.</p>
     <p>“I have made all my farewells,” she said; “and how have you been getting on?” And she
      invited him to re-enter the hotel.</p>
     <p>“I am ready to depart at this moment,” he said somewhat fiercely, “and was only thinking how
      I could extricate myself from that horrible dinner to-day at the Count of Ferroll’s.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that is not difficult,” said Myra; “you can write a note here if you like, at once. I
      think you must have seen quite enough of the Count of Ferroll and his friends.”</p>
     <p>Endymion sat down at the table, and announced his intended non-appearance at the Count’s
      dinner, for it could not be called an excuse. When he had finished, his sister said—</p>
     <p>“Do you know, we were nearly having a travelling companion to-morrow?”</p>
     <p>He looked up with a blush, for he fancied she was alluding to some previous scheme of Lady
      Montfort. “Indeed!” he said, “and who?”</p>
     <p>“Adriana.”</p>
     <p>“Adriana!” he repeated, somewhat relieved; “would she leave her family?”</p>
     <p>“She had a fancy, and I am sure I do not know any companion I could prefer to her. She is
      the only person of whom I could truly say, that every time I see her, I love her more.”</p>
     <p>“She seemed to like Paris very much,” said Endymion a little embarrassed.</p>
     <p>“The first part of her visit,” said Lady Roehampton, “she liked it amazingly. But my arrival
      and Lady Montfort’s, I fear, broke up their little parties. You were a great deal with the
      Neuchatels before we came?”</p>
     <p>“They are such a good family,” said Endymion; “so kind, so hospitable, such true friends.
      And Mr. Neuchatel himself is one of the shrewdest men that probably ever lived. I like talking
      with him, or rather, I like to hear him talk.”</p>
     <p>“O Endymion,” said Lady Roehampton, “if you were to marry Adriana, my happiness would be
      complete.”</p>
     <p>“Adriana will never marry,” said Endymion; “she is afraid of being married for her money. I
      know twenty men who would marry her, if they thought there was a chance of being accepted; and
      the best man, Eusford, did make her an offer—that I know. And where could she find a match
      more suitable?—high rank, and large estate, and a man that everybody speaks well of.”</p>
     <p>“Adriana will never marry except for the affections; there you are right, Endymion; she must
      love and she must be loved; but that is not very unreasonable in a person who is young,
      pretty, accomplished, and intelligent.”</p>
     <p>“She is all that,” said Endymion moodily.</p>
     <p>“And she loves you,” said Lady Roehampton.</p>
     <p>Endymion rather started, looked up for a moment at his sister, and then withdrew as hastily
      an agitated glance, and then with his eyes on the ground said, in a voice half murmuring, and
      yet scoffingly: “I should like to see Mr. Neuchatel’s face were I to ask permission to marry
      his daughter. I suppose he would not kick me downstairs; that is out of fashion; but he
      certainly would never ask me to dinner again, and that would be a sacrifice.”</p>
     <p>“You jest, Endymion; I am not jesting.”</p>
     <p>“There are some matters that can only be treated as a jest; and my marriage with Miss
      Neuchatel is one.”</p>
     <p>“It would make you one of the most powerful men in England,” said his sister.</p>
     <p>“Other impossible events would do the same.”</p>
     <p>“It is not impossible; it is very possible,” said his sister, “believe me, trust in me. The
      happiness of their daughter is more precious to the Neuchatels even than their fortune.”</p>
     <p>“I do not see why, at my age, I should be in such a hurry to marry,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“You cannot marry too soon, if by so doing you obtain the great object of life. Early
      marriages are to be deprecated, especially for men, because they are too frequently imprudent;
      but when a man can marry while he is young, and at once realise, by so doing, all the results
      which successful time may bring to him, he should not hesitate.”</p>
     <p>“I hesitate very much,” said Endymion. “I should hesitate very much, even if affairs were as
      promising as I think you may erroneously assume.”</p>
     <p>“But you must not hesitate, Endymion. We must never forget the great object for which we two
      live, for which, I believe, we were born twins—to rebuild our house; to raise it from poverty,
      and ignominy, and misery and squalid shame, to the rank and position which we demand, and
      which we believe we deserve. Did I hesitate when an offer of marriage was made to me, and the
      most unexpected that could have occurred? True it is, I married the best and greatest of men,
      but I did not know that when I accepted his hand. I married him for your sake, I married him
      for my own sake, for the sake of the house of Ferrars, which I wished to release and raise
      from its pit of desolation. I married him to secure for us both that opportunity for our
      qualities which they had lost, and which I believed, if enjoyed, would render us powerful and
      great.”</p>
     <p>Endymion rose from his seat and kissed his sister. “So long as you live,” he said, “we shall
      never be ignominious.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, but I am nothing; I am not a man, I am not a Ferrars. The best of me is that I may be
      a transient help to you. It is you who must do the deed. I am wearied of hearing you described
      as Lady Roehampton’s brother, or Lord Roehampton’s brother-in-law. I shall never be content
      till you are greater than we are, and there is but one and only one immediate way of
      accomplishing it, it is by this marriage—and a marriage with whom? with an angelic being!”</p>
     <p>“You take me somewhat by surprise, Myra. My thoughts have not been upon this matter. I
      cannot fairly describe myself at this moment as a marrying man.”</p>
     <p>“I know what you mean. You have female friendships, and I approve of them. They are
      invaluable to youth, and you have been greatly favoured in this respect. They have been a
      great assistance to you; beware lest they become a hindrance. A few years of such feelings in
      a woman’s life are a blazoned page, and when it is turned she has many other chapters, though
      they may not be as brilliant or adorned. But these few years in a man’s life may be, and in
      your case certainly would be, the very marrow of his destiny. During the last five or six
      years, ever since our emancipation, there has been a gradual but continuous development in
      your life. All has been preparatory for a position which you have acquired. That position may
      lead to anything—in your case, I will still believe, to everything—but there must be no
      faltering. Having crossed the Alps, you must not find a Capua. I speak to you as I have not
      spoken to you of late, because it was not necessary. But here is an opportunity which must not
      be lost. I feel half inspired, as when we parted in our misery at Hurstley, and I bade you,
      poor and obscure, go forth and conquer the world.”</p>
     <p>Late on the night of the day, their last day at Paris, on which this conversation took
      place, Endymion received a note in well-known handwriting, and it ran thus:</p>
     <p>“If it be any satisfaction to you to know that you made me very unhappy by not dining here
      to-day, you may be gratified. I am very unhappy. I know that I was unkind this morning, and
      rude, but as my anger was occasioned by your leaving me, my conduct might annoy but surely
      could not mortify you. I shall see you to-morrow, however early you may depart, as I cannot
      let your dear sister leave Paris without my embracing her.</p>
     <p>“Your faithful friend,</p>
     <p>“Berengaria.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
     <p>In old days, it was the habit to think and say that the House of Commons was an essentially
      “queer place,” which no one could understand until he was a member of it. It may, perhaps, be
      doubted whether that somewhat mysterious quality still altogether attaches to that assembly.
      “Our own Reporter,” has invaded it in all its purlieus. No longer content with giving an
      account of the speeches of its members, he is not satisfied unless he describes their persons,
      their dress, and their characteristic mannerisms. He tells us how they dine, even the wines
      and dishes which they favour, and follows them into the very mysteries of their smoking-room.
      And yet there is perhaps a certain fine sense of the feelings, and opinions, and humours of
      this assembly, which cannot be acquired by hasty notions and necessarily superficial remarks,
      but must be the result of long and patient observation, and of that quick sympathy with human
      sentiment, in all its classes, which is involved in the possession of that inestimable quality
      styled tact.</p>
     <p>When Endymion Ferrars first took his seat in the House of Commons, it still fully possessed
      its character of enigmatic tradition. It had been thought that this, in a great degree, would
      have been dissipated by the Reform Act of 1832, which suddenly introduced into the hallowed
      precinct a number of individuals whose education, manners, modes of thought, were different
      from those of the previous inhabitants, and in some instances, and in some respects, quite
      contrary to them. But this was not so. After a short time it was observed that the old
      material, though at first much less in quantity, had leavened the new mass; that the tone of
      the former House was imitated and adopted, and that at the end of five years, about the time
      Endymion was returned to Parliament, much of its serene, and refined, and even classical
      character had been recovered.</p>
     <p>For himself, he entered the chamber with a certain degree of awe, which, with use,
      diminished, but never entirely disappeared. The scene was one over which his boyhood even had
      long mused, and it was associated with all those traditions of genius, eloquence, and power
      that charm and inspire youth. His practical acquaintance with the forms and habits of the
      House from his customary attendance on their debates as private secretary to a cabinet
      minister, was of great advantage to him, and restrained that excitement which dangerously
      accompanies us when we enter into a new life, and especially a life of such deep and thrilling
      interests and such large proportions. This result was also assisted by his knowledge, at least
      by sight, of a large proportion of the old members, and by his personal and sometimes intimate
      acquaintance with those of his own party. There was much in his position, therefore, to soften
      that awkward feeling of being a freshman, which is always embarrassing.</p>
     <p>He took his place on the second bench of the opposition side of the House, and nearly behind
      Lord Roehampton. Mr. Bertie Tremaine, whom Endymion encountered in the lobby as he was
      escaping to dinner, highly disapproved of this step. He had greeted Endymion with affable
      condescension. “You made your first mistake to-night, my dear Ferrars. You should have taken
      your seat below the gangway and near me, on the Mountain. You, like myself, are a man of the
      future.”</p>
     <p>“I am a member of the opposition. I do not suppose it signifies much where I sit.”</p>
     <p>“On the contrary, it signifies everything. After this great Tory reaction there is nothing
      to be done now by speeches, and, in all probability, very little that can be effectually
      opposed. Much, therefore, depends upon where you sit. If you sit on the Mountain, the public
      imagination will be attracted to you, and when they are aggrieved, which they will be in good
      time, the public passion, which is called opinion, will look to you for representation. My
      advice to my friends now is to sit together and say nothing, but to profess through the press
      the most advanced opinions. We sit on the back bench of the gangway, and we call ourselves the
      Mountain.”</p>
     <p>Notwithstanding Mr. Bertie Tremaine’s oracular revelations, Endymion was very glad to find
      his old friend Trenchard generally his neighbour. He had a high opinion both of Trenchard’s
      judgment and acquirements, and he liked the man. In time they always managed to sit together.
      Job Thornberry took his seat below the gangway, on the opposition side, and on the floor of
      the House. Mr. Bertie Tremaine had sent his brother, Mr. Tremaine Bertie, to look after this
      new star, who he was anxious should ascend the Mountain; but Job Thornberry wishing to know
      whether the Mountain were going for “total and immediate,” and not obtaining a sufficiently
      distinct reply, declined the proffered intimation. Mr. Bertie Tremaine, being a landed
      proprietor as well as leader of the Mountain, was too much devoted to the rights of labour to
      sanction such middle-class madness.</p>
     <p>“Peel with have to do it,” said Job. “You will see.”</p>
     <p>“Peel now occupies the position of Necker,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine, “and will make the
      same <hi>fiasco</hi>. Then you will at last have a popular government.”</p>
     <p>“And the rights of labour?” asked Job. “All I hope is, I may have got safe to the States
      before that day.”</p>
     <p>“There will be no danger,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine. “There is this difference between the
      English Mountain and the French. The English Mountain has its government prepared. And my
      brother spoke to you because, when the hour arrives, I wished to see you a member of it.”</p>
     <p>“My dear Endymion,” said Waldershare, “let us dine together before we meet in mortal
      conflict, which I suppose will be soon. I really think your Mr. Bertie Tremaine the most
      absurd being out of Colney Hatch.”</p>
     <p>“Well, he has a purpose,” said Endymion; “and they say that a man with a purpose generally
      sees it realised.’</p>
     <p>“What I do like in him,” said Waldershare, “is this revival of the Pythagorean system, and a
      leading party of silence. That is rich.”</p>
     <p>One of the most interesting members of the House of Commons was Sir Fraunceys Scrope. He was
      the father of the House, though it was difficult to believe that from his appearance. He was
      tall, and had kept his distinguished figure; a handsome man, with a musical voice, and a
      countenance now benignant, though very bright, and once haughty. He still retained the same
      fashion of costume in which he had ridden up to Westminster more than half a century ago, from
      his seat in Derbyshire, to support his dear friend Charles Fox; real top-boots, and a blue
      coat and buff waistcoat. He was a great friend of Lord Roehampton, had a large estate in the
      same county, and had refused an earldom. Knowing Endymion, he came and sate by him one day in
      the House, and asked him, good-naturedly, how he liked his new life.</p>
     <p>“It is very different from what it was when I was your age. Up to Easter we rarely had a
      regular debate, never a party division; very few people came up indeed. But there was a good
      deal of speaking on all subjects before dinner. We had the privilege then of speaking on the
      presentation of petitions at any length, and we seldom spoke on any other occasion. After
      Easter there was always at least one great party fight. This was a mighty affair, talked of
      for weeks before it came off, and then rarely an adjourned debate. We were gentlemen, used to
      sit up late, and should have been sitting up somewhere else had we not been in the House of
      Commons. After this party fight, the House for the rest of the session was a mere club.”</p>
     <p>“There was not much business doing then,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“There was not much business in the country then. The House of Commons was very much like
      what the House of Lords is now. You went home to dine, and now and then came back for an
      important division.”</p>
     <p>“But you must always have had the estimates here,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Yes, but they ran through very easily. Hume was the first man who attacked the estimates.
      What are you going to do with yourself to-day? Will you take your mutton with me? You must
      come in boots, for it is now dinner-time, and you must return, I fancy. Twenty years ago, no
      man would think of coming down to the House except in evening dress. I remember so late as Mr.
      Canning, the minister always came down in silk stockings and pantaloons, or knee breeches. All
      things change, and quoting Virgil, as that young gentleman has just done, will be the next
      thing to disappear. In the last parliament we often had Latin quotations, but never from a
      member with a new constituency. I have heard Greek quoted here, but that was long ago, and a
      great mistake. The House was quite alarmed. Charles Fox used to say as to quotation—‘No Greek;
      as much Latin as you like; and never French under any circumstances. No English poet unless he
      had completed his century.’ These were like some other good rules, the unwritten orders of the
      House of Commons.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
     <p>While parliaments were dissolving and ministries forming, the disappointed seeking
      consolation and the successful enjoying their triumph, Simon, Earl of Montfort, who just
      missed being a great philosopher, was reading “Topsy Turvy,” which infinitely amused him; the
      style so picturesque and lambent! the tone so divertingly cynical! And if the knowledge of
      society in its pages was not so distinguished as that of human nature generally, this was a
      deficiency obvious only to a comparatively limited circle of its readers.</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort had reminded Endymion of his promise to introduce the distinguished author to
      him, and accordingly, after due researches as to his dwelling-place, Mr. Ferrars called in
      Jermyn Street and sent up his card, to know whether Mr. St. Barbe would receive him. This was
      evidently not a matter-of-course affair, and some little time had elapsed when the
      maid-servant appeared, and beckoned to Endymion to follow her upstairs.</p>
     <p>In the front drawing-room of the first floor, robed in a flaming dressing-gown, and standing
      with his back to the fire and to the looking-glass, the frame of which was encrusted with
      cards of invitation, the former colleague of Endymion received his visitor with a somewhat
      haughty and reserved air.</p>
     <p>“Well, I am delighted to see you again,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>No reply but a ceremonious bow.</p>
     <p>“And to congratulate you,” Endymion added after a moment’s pause. “I hear of nothing but of
      your book; I suppose one of the most successful that have appeared for a long time.”</p>
     <p>“Its success is not owing to your friends,” said Mr. St. Barbe tartly.</p>
     <p>“My friends!” said Endymion; “what could they have done to prevent it?”</p>
     <p>“They need not have dissolved parliament,” said Mr. St. Barbe with irritation. “It was
      nearly fatal to me; it would have been to anybody else. I was selling forty thousand a month;
      I believe more than Gushy ever reached; and so they dissolved parliament. The sale went down
      half at once—and now you expect me to support your party!”</p>
     <p>“Well, it was unfortunate, but the dissolution could hardly have done you any permanent
      injury, and you could scarcely expect that such an event could be postponed even for the
      advantage of an individual so distinguished as yourself.”</p>
     <p>“Perhaps not,” said St. Barbe, apparently a little mollified, “but they might have done
      something to show their regret at it.”</p>
     <p>“Something!” said Endymion, “what sort of thing?”</p>
     <p>“The prime minister might have called on me, or at least written to me a letter. I want none
      of their honours; I have scores of letters every day, suggesting that some high distinction
      should be conferred on me. I believe the nation expects me to be made a baronet. By the by, I
      heard the other day you had got into parliament. I know nothing of these matters; they do not
      interest me. Is it the fact?”</p>
     <p>“Well, I was so fortunate, and there are others of your old friends, Trenchard, for
      example.”</p>
     <p>“You do not mean to say that Trenchard is in parliament!” said St. Barbe, throwing off all
      his affected reserve. “Well, it is too disgusting! Trenchard in parliament, and I obliged to
      think it a great favour if a man gives me a frank! Well, representative institutions have seen
      their day. That is something.”</p>
     <p>“I have come here on a social mission,” said Endymion in a soothing tone. “There is a great
      admirer of yours who much wishes to make your acquaintance. Trusting to our old intimacy, of
      which of course I am very proud, it was even hoped that you might waive ceremony, and come and
      dine.”</p>
     <p>“Quite impossible!” exclaimed St. Barbe, and turning round, he pointed to the legion of
      invitations before him. “You see, the world is at my feet. I remember that fellow Seymour
      Hicks taking me to his rooms to show me a card he had from a countess. What would he say to
      this?”</p>
     <p>“Well, but you cannot be engaged to dinner every day,” said Endymion; “and you really may
      choose any day you like.”</p>
     <p>“Well, there are not many dinners among them, to be sure,” said St. Barbe. “Small and
      earlies. How I hate a ‘small and early’! Shown into a room where you meet a select few who
      have been asked to dinner, and who are chewing the cud like a herd of kine, and you are
      expected to tumble before them to assist their digestion! Faugh! No, sir; we only dine out
      now, and we think twice, I can tell you, before we accept even an invitation to dinner. Who’s
      your friend?”</p>
     <p>“Well, my friend is Lord Montfort.”</p>
     <p>“You do not mean to say that! And he is an admirer of mine?”</p>
     <p>“An enthusiastic admirer.”</p>
     <p>“I will dine with Lord Montfort. There is no one who appreciates so completely and so highly
      the old nobility of England as myself. They are a real aristocracy. None of the pinchbeck
      pedigrees and ormolu titles of the continent. Lord Montfort is, I think, an earl. A splendid
      title, earl! an English earl; count goes for nothing. The Earl of Montfort! An enthusiastic
      admirer of mine! The aristocracy of England, especially the old aristocracy, are highly
      cultivated. Sympathy from such a class is to be valued. I care for no other—I have always
      despised the million of vulgar. They have come to me, not I to them, and I have always told
      them the truth about themselves, that they are a race of snobs, and they rather like being
      told so. And now for your day?”</p>
     <p>“Why not this day if you be free? I will call for you about eight, and take you in my
      brougham to Montfort House.”</p>
     <p>“You have got a brougham! Well, I suppose so, being a member of parliament, though I know a
      good many members of parliament who have not got broughams. But your family, I remember,
      married into the swells. I do not grudge it you. You were always a good comrade to me. I never
      knew a man more free from envy than you, Ferrars, and envy is an odious vice. There are people
      I know, who, when they hear I have dined with the Earl of Montfort, will invent all sorts of
      stories against me, and send them to what they call the journals of society.”</p>
     <p>“Well, then, it shall be to-day,” said Endymion, rising.</p>
     <p>“It shall be to-day, and to tell the truth, I was thinking this morning where I should dine
      to-day. What I miss here are the cafes. Now in Paris you can dine every day exactly as it
      suits your means and mood. You may dine for a couple of francs in a quiet, unknown street, and
      very well; or you may dine for a couple of napoleons in a flaming saloon, with windows opening
      on a crowded boulevard. London is deficient in dining capability.”</p>
     <p>“You should belong to a club. Do you not?”</p>
     <p>“So I was told by a friend of mine the other day,—one of your great swells. He said I ought
      to belong to the Athenaeum, and he would propose me, and the committee would elect me as a
      matter of course. They rejected me and selected a bishop. And then people are surprised that
      the Church is in danger!”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER X</head>
     <p>The condition of England at the meeting of Parliament in 1842 was not satisfactory. The
      depression of trade in the manufacturing districts seemed overwhelming, and continued
      increasing during the whole of the year. A memorial from Stockport to the Queen in the spring
      represented that more than half the master spinners had failed, and that no less than three
      thousand dwelling-houses were untenanted. One-fifth of the population of Leeds were dependent
      on the poor-rates. The state of Sheffield was not less severe—and the blast furnaces of
      Wolverhampton were extinguished. There were almost daily meetings, at Liverpool, Manchester,
      and Leeds, to consider the great and increasing distress of the country, and to induce
      ministers to bring forward remedial measures; but as these were impossible, violence was soon
      substituted for passionate appeals to the fears or the humanity of the government. Vast bodies
      of the population assembled in Staleybridge, and Ashton, and Oldham, and marched into
      Manchester.</p>
     <p>For a week the rioting was unchecked, but the government despatched a strong military force
      to that city, and order was restored.</p>
     <p>The state of affairs in Scotland was not more favourable. There were food riots in several
      of the Scotch towns, and in Glasgow the multitude assembled, and then commenced what they
      called a begging tour, but which was really a progress of not disguised intimidation. The
      economic crisis in Ireland was yet to come, but the whole of that country was absorbed in a
      harassing and dangerous agitation for the repeal of the union between the two countries.</p>
     <p>During all this time, the Anti-Corn Law League was holding regular and frequent meetings at
      Manchester, at which statements were made distinguished by great eloquence and little scruple.
      But the able leaders of this confederacy never succeeded in enlisting the sympathies of the
      great body of the population. Between the masters and the workmen there was an alienation of
      feeling, which apparently never could be removed. This reserve, however, did not enlist the
      working classes on the side of the government; they had their own object, and one which they
      themselves enthusiastically cherished. And this was the Charter, a political settlement which
      was to restore the golden age, and which the master manufacturers and the middle classes
      generally looked upon with even more apprehension than Her Majesty’s advisers. It is hardly
      necessary to add, that in a state of affairs like that which is here faintly but still
      faithfully sketched, the rapid diminution of the revenue was inevitable, and of course that
      decline mainly occurred in the two all-important branches of the customs and excise.</p>
     <p>There was another great misfortune also which at this trying time hung over England. The
      country was dejected. The humiliating disasters of Afghanistan, dark narratives of which were
      periodically arriving, had produced a more depressing effect on the spirit of the country than
      all the victories and menaces of Napoleon in the heyday of his wild career. At home and
      abroad, there seemed nothing to sustain the national spirit; financial embarrassment,
      commercial and manufacturing distress, social and political agitation on the one hand, and on
      the other, the loss of armies, of reputation, perhaps of empire. It was true that these
      external misfortunes could hardly be attributed to the new ministry—but when a nation is
      thoroughly perplexed and dispirited, it soon ceases to make distinctions between political
      parties. The country is out of sorts, and the “government” is held answerable for the
      disorder.</p>
     <p>Thus it will be seen, that, though the new ministry were supported by a commanding majority
      in parliament, and that, too, after a recent appeal to the country, they were not popular, it
      may be truly said they were even the reverse. The opposition, on the other hand,
      notwithstanding their discomfiture, and, on some subjects, their disgrace, were by no means
      disheartened, and believed that there were economical causes at work, which must soon restore
      them to power.</p>
     <p>The minister brought forward his revision of the tariff, which was denounced by the League
      as futile, and in which anathema the opposition soon found it convenient to agree. Had the
      minister included in his measure that “total and immediate repeal” of the existing corn laws
      which was preached by many as a panacea, the effect would have been probably much the same. No
      doubt a tariff may aggravate, or may mitigate, such a condition of commercial depression as
      periodically visits a state of society like that of England, but it does not produce it. It
      was produced in 1842, as it had been produced at the present time, by an abuse of capital and
      credit, and by a degree of production which the wants of the world have not warranted.</p>
     <p>And yet all this time, there were certain influences at work in the great body of the
      nation, neither foreseen, nor for some time recognised, by statesmen and those great
      capitalists on whose opinion statesmen much depend, which were stirring, as it were, like the
      unconscious power of the forces of nature, and which were destined to baffle all the
      calculations of persons in authority and the leading spirits of all parties, strengthen a
      perplexed administration, confound a sanguine opposition, render all the rhetoric, statistics,
      and subscriptions of the Anti-Corn Law League fruitless, and absolutely make the Chartists
      forget the Charter.</p>
     <p>“My friends will not assist themselves by resisting the government measures,” said Mr.
      Neuchatel, with his usual calm smile, half sceptical, half sympathetic. “The measures will do
      no good, but they will do no harm. There are no measures that will do any good at this moment.
      We do not want measures; what we want is a new channel.”</p>
     <p>That is exactly what was wanted. There was abundant capital in the country and a mass of
      unemployed labour. But the markets on which they had of late depended, the American
      especially, were overworked and overstocked, and in some instances were not only overstocked,
      but disturbed by war, as the Chinese, for example—and capital and labour wanted “a new
      channel.”</p>
     <p>The new channel came, and all the persons of authority, alike political and commercial,
      seemed quite surprised that it had arrived; but when a thing or a man is wanted, they
      generally appear. One or two lines of railway, which had been long sleepily in formation,
      about this time were finished, and one or two lines of railway, which had been finished for
      some time and were unnoticed, announced dividends, and not contemptible ones. Suddenly there
      was a general feeling in the country, that its capital should be invested in railways; that
      the whole surface of the land should be transformed, and covered, as by a network, with these
      mighty means of communication. When the passions of the English, naturally an enthusiastic
      people, are excited on a subject of finance, their will, their determination, and resource,
      are irresistible. This was signally proved in the present instance, for they never ceased
      subscribing their capital until the sum entrusted to this new form of investment reached an
      amount almost equal to the national debt; and this too in a very few years. The immediate
      effect on the condition of the country was absolutely prodigious. The value of land rose, all
      the blast furnaces were relit, a stimulant was given to every branch of the home trade, the
      amount suddenly paid in wages exceeded that ever known in this country, and wages too at a
      high rate. Large portions of the labouring classes not only enjoyed comfort, but commanded
      luxury. All this of course soon acted on the revenue, and both customs and especially excise
      soon furnished an ample surplus.</p>
     <p>It cannot be pretended that all this energy and enterprise were free in their operation from
      those evils which, it seems, must inevitably attend any extensive public speculation, however
      well founded. Many of the scenes and circumstances recalled the days of the South Sea Scheme.
      The gambling in shares of companies which were formed only in name was without limit. The
      principal towns of the north established for that purpose stock exchanges of their own, and
      Leeds especially, one-fifth of whose population had been authoritatively described in the
      first session of the new parliament as dependent on the poor-rates, now boasted a stock
      exchange which in the extent of its transactions rivalled that of the metropolis. And the
      gambling was universal, from the noble to the mechanic. It was confined to no class and to no
      sex. The scene which took place at the Board of Trade on the last day on which plans could be
      lodged, and when midnight had arrived while crowds from the country were still filling the
      hall, and pressing at the doors, deserved and required for its adequate representation the
      genius of a Hogarth. This was the day on which it was announced that the total number of
      railway projects, on which deposits had been paid, had reached nearly to eight hundred.</p>
     <p>What is remarkable in this vast movement in which so many millions were produced, and so
      many more promised, is, that the great leaders of the financial world took no part in it. The
      mighty loan-mongers, on whose fiat the fate of kings and empires sometimes depended, seemed
      like men who, witnessing some eccentricity of nature, watch it with mixed feelings of
      curiosity and alarm. Even Lombard Street, which never was more wanted, was inactive, and it
      was only by the irresistible pressure of circumstances that a banking firm which had an
      extensive country connection was ultimately forced to take the leading part that was required,
      and almost unconsciously lay the foundation of the vast fortunes which it has realised, and
      organise the varied connection which it now commands. All seemed to come from the provinces,
      and from unknown people in the provinces.</p>
     <p>But in all affairs there must be a leader, and a leader appeared. He was more remarkable
      than the movement itself. He was a London tradesman, though a member of parliament returned
      for the first time to this House of Commons. This leader was Mr. Vigo.</p>
     <p>Mr. Vigo had foreseen what was coming, and had prepared for it. He agreed with Mr.
      Neuchatel, what was wanted was “a new channel.” That channel he thought he had discovered, and
      he awaited it. He himself could command no inconsiderable amount of capital, and he had a
      following of obscure rich friends who believed in him, and did what he liked. His daily visits
      to the City, except when he was travelling over England, and especially the north and midland
      counties, had their purpose and bore fruit. He was a director, and soon the chairman and
      leading spirit, of a railway which was destined to be perhaps our most important one. He was
      master of all the details of the business; he had arrived at conclusions on the question of
      the gauges, which then was a <hi>pons asinorum</hi> for the multitude, and understood all
      about rolling stock and permanent ways, and sleepers and branch lines, which were then
      cabalistic terms to the general. In his first session in parliament he had passed quietly and
      almost unnoticed several bills on these matters, and began to be recognised by the Committee
      of Selection as a member who ought to be “put on” for questions of this kind.</p>
     <p>The great occasion had arrived, and Mr. Vigo was equal to it. He was one of those few men
      who awake one day and find themselves famous. Suddenly it would seem that the name of Mr. Vigo
      was in everybody’s mouth. There was only one subject which interested the country, and he was
      recognised as the man who best understood it. He was an oracle, and, naturally, soon became an
      idol. The tariff of the ministers was forgotten, the invectives of the League were
      disregarded, their motions for the repeal of the corn laws were invariably defeated by large
      and contemptuous majorities. The House of Commons did nothing but pass railway bills, measures
      which were welcomed with unanimity by the House of Lords, whose estates were in consequence
      daily increasing in value. People went to the gallery to see Mr. Vigo introduce bills, and
      could scarcely restrain their enthusiasm at the spectacle of so much patriotic energy, which
      secured for them premiums for shares, which they held in undertakings of which the first sod
      was not yet cut. On one morning, the Great Cloudland Company, of which he was chairman, gave
      their approval of twenty-six bills, which he immediately introduced into parliament. Next day,
      the Ebor and North Cloudland sanctioned six bills under his advice, and affirmed deeds and
      agreements which affected all the principal railway projects in Lancashire and Yorkshire. A
      quarter of an hour later, just time to hurry from one meeting to another, where he was always
      received with rampant enthusiasm, Newcastle and the extreme north accepted his dictatorship.
      During a portion of two days, he obtained the consent of shareholders to forty bills,
      involving an expenditure of ten millions; and the engagements for one session alone amounted
      to one hundred and thirty millions sterling.</p>
     <p>Mr. Neuchatel shrugged his shoulders, but no one would listen even to Mr. Neuchatel, when
      the prime minister himself, supposed to be the most wary of men, and especially on financial
      subjects, in the very white heat of all this speculation, himself raised the first sod on his
      own estate in a project of extent and importance.</p>
     <p>Throughout these extraordinary scenes, Mr. Vigo, though not free from excitement, exhibited,
      on the whole, much self-control. He was faithful to his old friends, and no one profited more
      in this respect than Mr. Rodney. That gentleman became the director of several lines, and
      vice-chairman of one over which Mr. Vigo himself presided. No one was surprised that Mr.
      Rodney therefore should enter parliament. He came in by virtue of one of those petitions that
      Tadpole was always cooking, or baffling. Mr. Rodney was a supporter of the ministry, and Mr.
      Vigo was a Liberal, but Mr. Vigo returned Mr. Rodney to parliament all the same, and no one
      seemed astonished or complained. Political connection, political consistency, political
      principle, all vanished before the fascination of premiums.</p>
     <p>As for Endymion, the great man made him friendly and earnest overtures, and offered, if he
      would give his time to business, which, as he was in opposition, would be no great sacrifice,
      to promote and secure his fortune. But Endymion, after due reflection, declined, though with
      gratitude, these tempting proposals. Ferrars was an ambitious man, but not too imaginative a
      one. He had a main object in life, and that was to regain the position which had been
      forfeited, not by his own fault. His grandfather and his father before him had both been privy
      councillors and ministers of state. There had, indeed, been more than the prospect of his
      father filling a very prominent position. All had been lost, but the secret purpose of the
      life of Endymion was that, from being a clerk in a public office, he should arrive by his own
      energies at the station to which he seemed, as it were, born. To accomplish this he felt that
      the entire devotion of his labour and thought was requisite. His character was essentially
      tenacious, and he had already realised no inconsiderable amount of political knowledge and
      official experience. His object seemed difficult and distant, but there was nothing wild or
      visionary in its pursuit. He had achieved some of the first steps, and he was yet very young.
      There were friends about him, however, who were not content with what they deemed his moderate
      ambition, and thought they discerned in him qualities which might enable him to mount to a
      higher stage. However this might be, his judgment was that he must resist the offers of Mr.
      Vigo, though they were sincerely kind, and so he felt them.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, he frequently met that gentleman, and not merely in the House of Commons.
      Mr. St. Barbe would have been frantically envious could he have witnessed and perused the
      social invitations that fell like a continuous snow-storm on the favoured roof of Mr. Vigo.
      Mr. Vigo was not a party question. He dined with high patricians who forgot their political
      differences, while they agreed in courting the presence of this great benefactor of his
      country. The fine ladies were as eager in their homage to this real patriot, and he might be
      seen between rival countesses, who emulated each other in their appreciation of his public
      services. These were Mr. Vigo’s dangerous suitors. He confessed to Endymion one day that he
      could not manage the great ladies. “Male swells,” he would say laughingly, “I have measured
      physically and intellectually.” The golden youth of the country seemed fascinated by his
      society, repeated his sententious bons-mot, and applied for shares in every company which he
      launched into prosperous existence.</p>
     <p>Mr. Vigo purchased a splendid mansion in St. James’ Square, where invitations to his
      banquets were looked upon almost as commands. His chief cook was one of the celebrities of
      Europe, and though he had served emperors, the salary he received from Mr. Vigo exceeded any
      one he had hitherto condescended to pocket. Mr. Vigo bought estates, hired moors, lavished his
      money, not only with profusion, but with generosity. Everything was placed at his command, and
      it appeared that there was nothing that he refused. “When this excitement is over,” said Mr.
      Bertie Tremaine, “I hope to induce him to take India.”</p>
     <p>In the midst of this commanding effulgence, the calmer beam of Mr. Rodney might naturally
      pass unnoticed, yet its brightness was clear and sustained. The Rodneys engaged a dwelling of
      no mean proportion in that favoured district of South Kensington, which was then beginning to
      assume the high character it has since obtained. Their equipages were distinguished, and when
      Mrs. Rodney entered the Park, driving her matchless ponies, and attended by outriders, and
      herself bright as Diana, the world leaning over its palings witnessed her appearance with
      equal delight and admiration.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
     <p>We have rather anticipated, for the sake of the subject, in our last chapter, and we must
      now recur to the time when, after his return from Paris, Endymion entered into what was
      virtually his first session in the House of Commons. Though in opposition, and with all the
      delights of the most charming society at his command, he was an habitual and constant
      attendant. One might have been tempted to believe that he would turn out to be, though a
      working, only a silent member, but his silence was only prudence. He was deeply interested and
      amused in watching the proceedings, especially when those took part in them with whom he was
      acquainted. Job Thornberry occupied a leading position in the debates. He addressed the House
      very shortly after he took his seat, and having a purpose and a most earnest one, and being
      what is styled a representative man of his subject, the House listened to him at once, and his
      place in debate was immediately recognised. The times favoured him, especially during the
      first and second session, while the commercial depression lasted; afterwards, he was always
      listened to, because he had great oratorical gifts, a persuasive style that was winning, and,
      though he had no inconsiderable powers of sarcasm, his extreme tact wisely guided him to
      restrain for the present that dangerous, though most effective, weapon.</p>
     <p>The Pythagorean school, as Waldershare styled Mr. Bertie Tremaine and his following, very
      much amused Endymion. The heaven-born minister air of the great leader was striking. He never
      smiled, or at any rate contemptuously. Notice of a question was sometimes publicly given from
      this bench, but so abstruse in its nature and so quaint in its expression, that the House
      never comprehended it, and the unfortunate minister who had to answer, even with twenty-four
      hours’ study, was obliged to commence his reply by a conjectural interpretation of the query
      formally addressed to him. But though they were silent in the House, their views were
      otherwise powerfully represented. The weekly journal devoted to their principles was
      sedulously circulated among members of the House. It was called the “Precursor,” and
      systematically attacked not only every institution, but, it might be said, every law, and all
      the manners and customs, of the country. Its style was remarkable, never excited or
      impassioned, but frigid, logical, and incisive, and suggesting appalling revolutions with the
      calmness with which one would narrate the ordinary incidents of life. The editor of the
      “Precursor” was Mr. Jawett, selected by that great master of human nature, Mr. Bertie
      Tremaine. When it got about, that the editor of this fearful journal was a clerk in a public
      office, the indignation of the government, or at least of their supporters, was extreme, and
      there was no end to the punishments and disgrace to which he was to be subjected; but
      Waldershare, who lived a good deal in Bohemia, was essentially cosmopolitan, and dabbled in
      letters, persuaded his colleagues not to make the editor of the “Precursor” a martyr, and
      undertook with their authority to counteract his evil purposes by literary means alone.</p>
     <p>Being fully empowered to take all necessary steps for this object, Waldershare thought that
      there was no better mode of arresting public attention to his enterprise than by engaging for
      its manager the most renowned pen of the hour, and he opened himself on the subject in the
      most sacred confidence to Mr. St. Barbe. That gentleman, invited to call upon a minister,
      sworn to secrecy, and brimful of state secrets, could not long restrain himself, and with
      admirable discretion consulted on his views and prospects Mr. Endymion Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“But I thought you were one of us,” said Endymion; “you asked me to put you in the way of
      getting into Brooks’!”</p>
     <p>“What of that?” said Mr. St. Barbe; “and when you remember what the Whigs owe to literary
      men, they ought to have elected me into Brooks’ without my asking for it.”</p>
     <p>“Still, if you be on the other side?”</p>
     <p>“It is nothing to do with sides,” said Mr. St. Barbe; “this affair goes far beyond sides.
      The ‘Precursor’ wants to put down the Crown; I shall put down the ‘Precursor.’ It is an affair
      of the closet, not of sides—an affair of the royal closet, sir. I am acting for the Crown,
      sir; the Crown has appealed to me. I save the Crown, and there must be personal relations with
      the highest,” and he looked quite fierce.</p>
     <p>“Well, you have not written your first article yet,” said Endymion. “I shall look forward to
      it with much interest.”</p>
     <p>After Easter, Lord Roehampton said to Endymion that a question ought to be put on a subject
      of foreign policy of importance, and on which he thought the ministry were in difficulties;
      “and I think you might as well ask it, Endymion. I will draw up the question, and you will
      give notice of it. It will be a reconnaissance.”</p>
     <p>The notice of this question was the first time Endymion opened his mouth in the House of
      Commons. It was an humble and not a very hazardous office, but when he got on his legs his
      head swam, his heart beat so violently, that it was like a convulsion preceding death, and
      though he was only on his legs for a few seconds, all the sorrows of his life seemed to pass
      before him. When he sate down, he was quite surprised that the business of the House proceeded
      as usual, and it was only after some time that he became convinced that no one but himself was
      conscious of his sufferings, or that he had performed a routine duty otherwise than in a
      routine manner.</p>
     <p>The crafty question, however, led to some important consequences. When asked, to the
      surprise of every one the minister himself replied to it. Waldershare, with whom Endymion
      dined at Bellamy’s that day, was in no good humour in consequence.</p>
     <p>When Lord Roehampton had considered the ministerial reply, he said to Endymion, “This must
      be followed up. You must move for papers. It will be a good opportunity for you, for the House
      is up to something being in the wind, and they will listen. It will be curious to see whether
      the minister follows you. If so, he will give me an opening.”</p>
     <p>Endymion felt that this was the crisis of his life. He knew the subject well, and he had all
      the tact and experience of Lord Roehampton to guide him in his statement and his arguments. He
      had also the great feeling that, if necessary, a powerful arm would support him. It was about
      a week before the day arrived, and Endymion slept very little that week, and the night before
      his motion not a wink. He almost wished he was dead as he walked down to the House in the hope
      that the exercise might remedy, or improve, his languid circulation; but in vain, and when his
      name was called and he had to rise, his hands and feet were like ice.</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton and Lady Montfort were both in the ventilator, and he knew it.</p>
     <p>It might be said that he was sustained by his utter despair. He felt so feeble and generally
      imbecile, that he had not vitality enough to be sensible of failure.</p>
     <p>He had a kind audience, and an interested one. When he opened his mouth, he forgot his first
      sentence, which he had long prepared. In trying to recall it and failing, he was for a moment
      confused. But it was only for a moment; the unpremeditated came to his aid, and his voice, at
      first tremulous, was recognised as distinct and rich. There was a murmur of sympathy, and not
      merely from his own side. Suddenly, both physically and intellectually, he was quite himself.
      His arrested circulation flowed, and fed his stagnant brain. His statement was lucid, his
      arguments were difficult to encounter, and his manner was modest. He sate down amid general
      applause, and though he was then conscious that he had omitted more than one point on which he
      had relied, he was on the whole satisfied, and recollected that he might use them in reply, a
      privilege to which he now looked forward with feelings of comfort and confidence.</p>
     <p>The minister again followed him, and in an elaborate speech. The subject evidently, in the
      opinion of the minister, was of too delicate and difficult a character to trust to a
      subordinate. Overwhelmed as he was with the labours of his own department, the general conduct
      of affairs, and the leadership of the House, he still would undertake the representation of an
      office with whose business he was not familiar. Wary and accurate he always was, but in
      discussions on foreign affairs, he never exhibited the unrivalled facility with which he ever
      treated a commercial or financial question, or that plausible promptness with which, at a
      moment’s notice, he could encounter any difficulty connected with domestic administration.</p>
     <p>All these were qualities which Lord Roehampton possessed with reference to the affairs over
      which he had long presided, and in the present instance, following the minister, he was
      particularly happy. He had a good case, and he was gratified by the success of Endymion. He
      complimented him and confuted his opponent, and, not satisfied with demolishing his arguments,
      Lord Roehampton indulged in a little raillery which the House enjoyed, but which was never
      pleasing to the more solemn organisation of his rival.</p>
     <p>No language can describe the fury of Waldershare as to the events of this evening. He looked
      upon the conduct of the minister, in not permitting him to represent his department, as a
      decree of the incapacity of his subordinate, and of the virtual termination of the official
      career of the Under-Secretary of State. He would have resigned the next day had it not been
      for the influence of Lady Beaumaris, who soothed him by suggesting, that it would be better to
      take an early opportunity of changing his present post for another.</p>
     <p>The minister was wrong. He was not fond of trusting youth, but it is a confidence which
      should be exercised, particularly in the conduct of a popular assembly. If the under-secretary
      had not satisfactorily answered Endymion, which no one had a right to assume, for Waldershare
      was a brilliant man, the minister could have always advanced to the rescue at the fitting
      time. As it was, he made a personal enemy of one who naturally might have ripened into a
      devoted follower, and who from his social influence, as well as from his political talents,
      was no despicable foe.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
     <p>Notwithstanding the great political, and consequently social, changes that had taken place,
      no very considerable alteration occurred in the general life of those chief personages in
      whose existence we have attempted to interest the reader. However vast may appear to be the
      world in which we move, we all of us live in a limited circle. It is the result of
      circumstances; of our convenience and our taste. Lady Beaumaris became the acknowledged leader
      of Tory society, and her husband was so pleased with her position, and so proud of it, that he
      in a considerable degree sacrificed his own pursuits and pleasures for its maintenance. He
      even refused the mastership of a celebrated hunt, which had once been an object of his highest
      ambition, that he might be early and always in London to support his wife in her receptions.
      Imogene herself was universally popular. Her gentle and natural manners, blended with a due
      degree of self-respect, her charming appearance, and her ready but unaffected sympathy, won
      every heart. Lady Roehampton was her frequent guest. Myra continued her duties as a leader of
      society, as her lord was anxious that the diplomatic world should not forget him. These were
      the two principal and rival houses. The efforts of Lady Montfort were more fitful, for they
      were to a certain degree dependent on the moods of her husband. It was observed that Lady
      Beaumaris never omitted attending the receptions of Lady Roehampton, and the tone of almost
      reverential affection with which she ever approached Myra was touching to those who were in
      the secret, but they were few.</p>
     <p>No great change occurred in the position of Prince Florestan, except that in addition to the
      sports to which he was apparently devoted, he gradually began to interest himself in the turf.
      He had bred several horses of repute, and one, which he had named Lady Roehampton, was the
      favourite for a celebrated race. His highness was anxious that Myra should honour him by being
      his guest. This had never occurred before, because Lord Roehampton felt that so avowed an
      intimacy with a personage in the peculiar position of Prince Florestan was hardly becoming a
      Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; but that he was no longer, and being the most
      good-natured man that ever lived, and easily managed in little things, he could not refuse
      Myra when she consulted him, as they call it, on the subject, and it was settled that Lord and
      Lady Roehampton were to dine with Prince Florestan. The prince was most anxious that Mr.
      Sidney Wilton should take this occasion of consenting to a reconciliation with him, and Lady
      Roehampton exerted herself much for this end. Mr. Sidney Wilton was in love with Lady
      Roehampton, and yet on this point he was inexorable. Lord and Lady Beaumaris went, and Lady
      Montfort, to whom the prince had addressed a private note of his own that quite captivated
      her, and Mr. and Mrs. Neuchatel and Adriana. Waldershare, Endymion, and Baron Sergius
      completed the guests, who were received by the Duke of St. Angelo and a couple of
      aides-de-camp. When the prince entered all rose, and the ladies curtseyed very low. Lord
      Roehampton resumed his seat immediately, saying to his neighbour, “I rose to show my respect
      to my host; I sit down to show that I look upon him as a subject like myself.”</p>
     <p>“A subject of whom?” inquired Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“There is something in that,” said Lord Roehampton, smiling.</p>
     <p>The Duke of St. Angelo was much disturbed by the conduct of Lord Roehampton, which had
      disappointed his calculations, and he went about lamenting that Lord Roehampton had a little
      gout.</p>
     <p>They had assembled in the library and dined on the same floor. The prince was seated between
      Lady Montfort, whom he accompanied to dinner, and Lady Roehampton. Adriana fell to Endymion’s
      lot. She looked very pretty, was beautifully dressed, and for her, was even gay. Her companion
      was in good spirits, and she seemed interested and amused. The prince never spoke much, but
      his remarks always told. He liked murmuring to women, but when requisite, he could throw a fly
      over the table with adroitness and effect. More than once during the dinner he whispered to
      Lady Roehampton: “This is too kind—your coming here. But you have always been my best friend.”
      The dinner would have been lively and successful even if Waldershare had not been there, but
      he to-day was exuberant and irresistible. His chief topic was abuse of the government of which
      he was a member, and he lavished all his powers of invective and ridicule alike on the
      imbecility of their policy and their individual absurdities. All this much amused Lady
      Montfort, and gave Lord Roehampton an opportunity to fool the Under-Secretary of State to the
      top of his bent.</p>
     <p>“If you do not take care,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “they will turn you out.”</p>
     <p>“I wish they would,” said Waldershare. “That is what I am longing for. I should go then all
      over the country and address public meetings. It would be the greatest thing since
      Sacheverell.”</p>
     <p>“Our people have not behaved well to Mr. Waldershare,” whispered Imogene to Lord Roehampton,
      “but I think we shall put it all right.”</p>
     <p>“Do you believe it?” inquired Lady Montfort of Lord Roehampton. He had been speaking to her
      for some little time in a hushed tone, and rather earnestly.</p>
     <p>“Indeed I do; I cannot well see what there is to doubt about it. We know the father very
      well—an excellent man; he was the parish priest of Lady Roehampton before her marriage, when
      she lived in the country. And we know from him that more than a year ago something was
      contemplated. The son gave up his living then; he has remained at Rome ever since. And now I
      am told he returns to us, the Pope’s legate and an archbishop <hi>in partibus</hi>!”</p>
     <p>“It is most interesting,” said Lady Montfort. “I was always his great admirer.”</p>
     <p>“I know that; you and Lady Roehampton made me go and hear him. The father will be terribly
      distressed.”</p>
     <p>“I do not care at all about the father,” said Lady Montfort; “but the son had such a fine
      voice and was so very good-looking. I hope I shall see him.”</p>
     <p>They were speaking of Nigel Penruddock, whose movements had been a matter of much mystery
      during the last two years. Rumours of his having been received into the Roman Church had been
      often rife; sometimes flatly, and in time faintly, contradicted. Now the facts seemed
      admitted, and it would appear that he was about to return to England not only as a Roman
      Catholic, but as a distinguished priest of the Church, and, it was said, even the
      representative of the Papacy.</p>
     <p>All the guests rose at the same time—a pleasant habit—and went upstairs to the brilliantly
      lighted saloons. Lord Roehampton seated himself by Baron Sergius, with whom he was always glad
      to converse. “We seem here quiet and content?” said the ex-minister inquiringly.</p>
     <p>“I hope so, and I think so,” said Sergius. “He believes in his star, and will leave
      everything to its influence. There are to be no more adventures.”</p>
     <p>“It must be a great relief to Lord Roehampton to have got quit of office,” said Mrs.
      Neuchatel to Lady Roehampton. “I always pitied him so much. I never can understand why people
      voluntarily incur such labours and anxiety.”</p>
     <p>“You should join us,” said Mr. Neuchatel to Waldershare. “They would be very glad to see you
      at Brooks’.”</p>
     <p>“Brooks’ may join the October Club which I am going to revive,” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“I never heard of that club,” said Mr. Neuchatel.</p>
     <p>“It was a much more important thing than the Bill of Rights or the Act of Settlement,” said
      Waldershare, “all the same.”</p>
     <p>“I want to see his mother’s portrait in the farther saloon,” said Lady Montfort to Myra.</p>
     <p>“Let us go together.” And Lady Roehampton rose, and they went.</p>
     <p>It was a portrait of Queen Agrippina by a master hand, and admirably illumined by reflected
      light, so that it seemed to live.</p>
     <p>“She must have been very beautiful,” said Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Mr. Sidney Wilton was devotedly attached to her, my lord has told me,” said Lady
      Roehampton.</p>
     <p>“So many were devotedly attached to her,” said Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>“Yes; she was like Mary of Scotland, whom some men are in love with even to this day. Her
      spell was irresistible. There are no such women now.”</p>
     <p>“Yes; there is one,” said Lady Montfort, suddenly turning round and embracing Lady
      Roehampton; “and I know she hates me, because she thinks I prevent her brother from
      marrying.”</p>
     <p>“Dear Lady Montfort, how can you use such strong expressions? I am sure there can be only
      one feeling of Endymion’s friends to you, and that is gratitude for your kindness to him.”</p>
     <p>“I have done nothing for him; I can do nothing for him. I felt that when we were trying to
      get him into parliament. If he could marry, and be independent, and powerful, and rich, it
      would be better, perhaps, for all of us.”</p>
     <p>“I wish he were independent, and powerful, and rich,” said Myra musingly. “That would be a
      fairy tale. At present, he must be content that he has some of the kindest friends in the
      world.”</p>
     <p>“He interests me very much; no one so much. I am sincerely, even deeply attached to him; but
      it is like your love, it is a sister’s love. There is only one person I really love in the
      world, and alas! he does not love me!” And her voice was tremulous.</p>
     <p>“Do not say such things, dear Lady Montfort. I never can believe what you sometimes intimate
      on that subject. Do you know, I think it a little hallucination.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort shook her head with a truly mournful expression, and then suddenly, her
      beautiful face wreathed with smiles, she said in a gay voice, “We will not think of such
      sorrows. I wish them to be entombed in my heart, but the spectres will rise sometimes. Now
      about your brother. I do not mean to say that it would not be a great loss to me if he
      married, but I wish him to marry if you do. For myself, I must have a male friend, and he must
      be very clever, and thoroughly understand politics. You know you deprived me of Lord
      Roehampton,” she continued smilingly, “who was everything I could desire; and the Count of
      Ferroll would have suited me excellently, but then he ran away. Now Endymion could not easily
      run away, and he is so agreeable and so intelligent, that at last I thought I had found a
      companion worth helping—and I meant, and still mean, to work hard—until he is prime
      minister.”</p>
     <p>“I have my dreams too about that,” said Lady Roehampton, “but we are all about the same age,
      and can wait a little.”</p>
     <p>“He cannot be minister too soon,” said Lady Montfort. “It was not being minister soon that
      ruined Charles Fox.”</p>
     <p>The party broke up. The prince made a sign to Waldershare, which meant a confidential cigar,
      and in a few minutes they were alone together.</p>
     <p>“What women!” exclaimed the prince. “Not to be rivalled in this city, and yet quite unlike
      each other.”</p>
     <p>“And which do you admire most, sir?” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>The prince trimmed his cigar, and then he said, “I will tell you this day five years.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
     <p>The ecclesiastical incident mentioned at the dinner described in our last chapter, produced
      a considerable effect in what is called society. Nigel Penruddock had obtained great celebrity
      as a preacher, while his extreme doctrines and practices had alike amazed, fascinated, and
      alarmed a large portion of the public. For some time he had withdrawn from the popular gaze,
      but his individuality was too strong to be easily forgotten, even if occasional paragraphs as
      to his views and conduct, published, contradicted, and reiterated, were not sufficient to
      sustain, and even stimulate, curiosity. That he was about to return to his native land, as the
      Legate of His Holiness, was an event which made many men look grave, and some female hearts
      flutter.</p>
     <p>The memory of Lady Roehampton could not escape from the past, and she could not recall it
      and all the scenes at Hurstley without emotion; and Lady Montfort remembered with some pride
      and excitement, that the Legate of the Pope had been one of her heroes. It was evident that he
      had no wish to avoid his old acquaintances, for shortly after his arrival, and after he had
      assembled his suffragans, and instructed the clergy of his district, for dioceses did not then
      exist, Archbishop Penruddock, for so the Metropolitan of Tyre simply styled himself, called
      upon both these ladies.</p>
     <p>His first visit was to Myra, and notwithstanding her disciplined self-control, her intense
      pride, and the deep and daring spirit which always secretly sustained her, she was nervous and
      agitated, but only in her boudoir. When she entered the saloon to welcome him, she seemed as
      calm as if she were going to an evening assembly.</p>
     <p>Nigel was changed. Instead of that anxious and moody look which formerly marred the refined
      beauty of his countenance, his glance was calm and yet radiant. He was thinner, it might
      almost be said emaciated, which seemed to add height to his tall figure.</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton need not have been nervous about the interview, and the pain of its
      inevitable associations. Except one allusion at the end of his visit, when his Grace mentioned
      some petty grievance, of which he wished to relieve his clergy, and said, “I think I will
      consult your brother; being in the opposition, he will be less embarrassed than some of my
      friends in the government, or their supporters,” he never referred to the past. All he spoke
      of was the magnitude of his task, the immense but inspiring labours which awaited him, and his
      deep sense of his responsibility. Nothing but the Divine principle of the Church could sustain
      him. He was at one time hopeful that His Holiness might have thought the time ripe for the
      restoration of the national hierarchy, but it was decreed otherwise. Had it been accorded, no
      doubt it would have assisted him. A prelate <hi>in partibus</hi> is, in a certain sense, a
      stranger, whatever his duties, and the world is more willing when it is appealed to by one who
      has “a local habitation and a name;” he is identified with the people among whom he lives.
      There was much to do. The state of the Catholic poor in his own district was heartrending. He
      never could have conceived such misery, and that too under the shadow of the Abbey. The few
      schools which existed were wretched, and his first attention must be given to this capital
      deficiency. He trusted much to female aid. He meant to invite the great Catholic ladies to
      unite with him in a common labour of love. In this great centre of civilisation, and wealth,
      and power, there was need of the spirit of a St. Ursula.</p>
     <p>No one seemed more pleased by the return of Archbishop Penruddock than Lord Montfort. He
      appeared to be so deeply interested in his Grace’s mission, sought his society so often,
      treated him with such profound respect, almost ceremony, asked so many questions about what
      was happening at Rome, and what was going to be done here—that Nigel might have been pardoned
      if he did not despair of ultimately inducing Lord Montfort to return to the faith of his
      illustrious ancestors. And yet, all this time, Lord Montfort was only amusing himself; a new
      character was to him a new toy, and when he could not find one, he would dip into the “Memoirs
      of St. Simon.”</p>
     <p>Instead of avoiding society, as was his wont in the old days, the Archbishop sought it. And
      there was nothing exclusive in his social habits; all classes and all creeds, all conditions
      and orders of men, were alike interesting to him; they were part of the mighty community, with
      all whose pursuits, and passions, and interests, and occupations he seemed to sympathise, but
      respecting which he had only one object—to bring them back once more to that imperial fold
      from which, in an hour of darkness and distraction, they had miserably wandered. The
      conversion of England was deeply engraven on the heart of Penruddock; it was his constant
      purpose, and his daily and nightly prayer.</p>
     <p>So the Archbishop was seen everywhere, even at fashionable assemblies. He was a frequent
      guest at banquets which he never tasted, for he was a smiling ascetic, and though he seemed to
      be preaching or celebrating high mass in every part of the metropolis, organising schools,
      establishing convents, and building cathedrals, he could find time to move philanthropic
      resolutions at middle-class meetings, attend learned associations, and even occasionally send
      a paper to the Royal Society.</p>
     <p>The person who fell most under the influence of the archbishop was Waldershare. He was
      fairly captivated by him. Nothing would satisfy Waldershare till he had brought the archbishop
      and Prince Florestan together. “You are a Roman Catholic prince, sir,” he would say. “It is
      absolute folly to forego such a source of influence and power as the Roman Catholic Church.
      Here is your man; a man made for the occasion, a man who may be pope. Come to an understanding
      with him, and I believe you will regain your throne in a year.”</p>
     <p>“But, my dear Waldershare, it is very true I am a Roman Catholic, but I am also the head of
      the Liberal party in my country, and perhaps also on the continent of Europe, and they are not
      particularly affected to archbishops and popes.”</p>
     <p>“Old-fashioned twaddle of the Liberal party,” exclaimed Waldershare. “There is more true
      democracy in the Roman Catholic Church than in all the secret societies of Europe.”</p>
     <p>“There is something in that,” said the prince musingly, “and my friends are Roman Catholics,
      nominally Roman Catholics. If I were quite sure your man and the priests generally were
      nominally Roman Catholics, something might be done.”</p>
     <p>“As for that,” said Waldershare, “sensible men are all of the same religion.”</p>
     <p>“And pray what is that?” inquired the prince.</p>
     <p>“Sensible men never tell.”</p>
     <p>Perhaps there was no family which suited him more, and where the archbishop became more
      intimate, than the Neuchatels. He very much valued a visit to Hainault, and the miscellaneous
      and influential circles he met there—merchant princes, and great powers of Lombard Street and
      the Stock Exchange. The Governor of the Bank happened to be a high churchman, and listened to
      the archbishop with evident relish. Mrs. Neuchatel also acknowledged the spell of his society,
      and he quite agreed with her that people should be neither so poor nor so rich. She had long
      mused over plans of social amelioration, and her new ally was to teach her how to carry them
      into practice. As for Mr. Neuchatel, he was pleased that his wife was amused, and liked the
      archbishop as he liked all clever men. “You know,” he would say, “I am in favour of all
      churches, provided, my lord archbishop, they do not do anything very foolish. Eh? So I shall
      subscribe to your schools with great pleasure. We cannot have too many schools, even if they
      only keep young people from doing mischief.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
     <p>The prosperity of the country was so signal, while Mr. Vigo was unceasingly directing
      millions of our accumulated capital, and promises of still more, into the “new channel,” that
      it seemed beyond belief that any change of administration could even occur, at least in the
      experience of the existing generation. The minister to whose happy destiny it had fallen to
      gratify the large appetites and reckless consuming powers of a class now first known in our
      social hierarchy as “Navvies,” was hailed as a second Pitt. The countenance of the opposition
      was habitually dejected, with the exception of those members of it on whom Mr. Vigo graciously
      conferred shares, and Lady Montfort taunted Mr. Sidney Wilton with inquiries, why he and his
      friends had not made railroads, instead of inventing nonsense about cheap bread. Job
      Thornberry made wonderful speeches in favour of total and immediate repeal of the corn laws,
      and the Liberal party, while they cheered him, privately expressed their regret that such a
      capital speaker, who might be anything, was not a practical man. Low prices, abundant
      harvests, and a thriving commerce had rendered all appeals, varied even by the persuasive
      ingenuity of Thornberry, a wearisome irritation; and, though the League had transplanted
      itself from Manchester to the metropolis, and hired theatres for their rhetoric, the close of
      1845 found them nearly reduced to silence.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bertie Tremaine, who was always studying the spirit of the age, announced to the
      initiated that Mr. Vigo had something of the character and structure of Napoleon, and that he
      himself began to believe, that an insular nation, with such an enormous appetite, was not
      adapted to cosmopolitan principles, which were naturally of a character more spiritual and
      abstract. Mr. Bertie Tremaine asked Mr. Vigo to dinner, and introduced him to several
      distinguished youths of extreme opinions, who were dining off gold plate. Mr. Vigo was much
      flattered by his visit; his host made much of him; and he heard many things on the principles
      of government, and even of society, in the largest sense of the expression, which astonished
      and amused him. In the course of the evening he varied the conversation—one which became the
      classic library and busts of the surrounding statesmen—by promising to most of the guests
      allotments of shares in a new company, not yet launched, but whose securities were already at
      a high premium.</p>
     <p>Endymion, in the meantime, pursued the even tenor of his way. Guided by the experience,
      unrivalled knowledge, and consummate tact of Lord Roehampton, he habitually made inquiries, or
      brought forward motions, which were evidently inconvenient or embarrassing to the ministry;
      and the very circumstance, that he was almost always replied to by the prime minister,
      elevated him in the estimation of the House as much as the pertinence of his questions, and
      the accurate information on which he founded his motions. He had not taken the House with a
      rush like Job Thornberry, but, at the end of three sessions, he was a personage universally
      looked upon as one who was “certain to have office.”</p>
     <p>There was another new member who had also made way, though slowly, and that was Mr.
      Trenchard; he had distinguished himself on a difficult committee, on which he had guided a
      perplexed minister, who was chairman, through many intricacies. Mr. Trenchard watched the
      operations of Mr. Vigo, with a calm, cold scrutiny, and ventured one day to impart his
      conviction to Endymion that there were breakers ahead. “Vigo is exhausting the floating
      capital of the country,” he said, and he offered to give him all the necessary details, if he
      would call the attention of the House to the matter. Endymion declined to do this, chiefly
      because he wished to devote himself to foreign affairs, and thought the House would hardly
      brook his interference also in finance. So he strongly advised Trenchard himself to undertake
      the task. Trenchard was modest, and a little timid about speaking; so it was settled that he
      should consult the leaders on the question, and particularly the gentleman who it was supposed
      would be their Chancellor of the Exchequer, if ever they were again called upon to form a
      ministry. This right honourable individual listened to Trenchard with the impatience which
      became a man of great experience addressed by a novice, and concluded the interview by saying,
      that he thought “there was nothing in it;” at the same time, he would turn it in his mind, and
      consult some practical men. Accordingly the ex- and future minister consulted Mr. Vigo, who
      assured him that he was quite right; that “there was nothing in it,” and that the floating
      capital of the country was inexhaustible.</p>
     <p>In the midst of all this physical prosperity, one fine day in August, parliament having just
      been prorogued, an unknown dealer in potatoes wrote to the Secretary of State, and informed
      him that he had reason to think that a murrain had fallen over the whole of the potato crops
      in England, and that, if it extended to Ireland, the most serious consequences must ensue.</p>
     <p>This mysterious but universal sickness of a single root changed the history of the
      world.</p>
     <p>“There is no gambling like politics,” said Lord Roehampton, as he glanced at the “Times,” at
      Princedown; “four cabinets in one week; the government must be more sick than the
      potatoes.”</p>
     <p>“Berengaria always says,” said Lord Montfort, “that you should see Princedown in summer. I,
      on the contrary, maintain it is essentially a winter residence, for, if there ever be a
      sunbeam in England, Princedown always catches it. Now to-day, one might fancy one’s self at
      Cannes.”</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort was quite right, but even the most wilful and selfish of men was generally
      obliged to pass his Christmas at his northern castle. Montforts had passed their Christmas in
      that grim and mighty dwelling-place for centuries. Even he was not strong enough to contend
      against such tradition. Besides, every one loves power, even if they do not know what to do
      with it. There are such things as memberships for counties, which, if public feeling be not
      outraged, are hereditary, and adjacent boroughs, which, with a little management and much
      expense, become reasonable and loyal. If the flag were rarely to wave on the proud keep of
      Montfort, all these satisfactory circumstances would be greatly disturbed and baffled; and if
      the ancient ensign did not promise welcome and hospitality at Christmas, some of the principal
      uses even of Earls of Montfort might be questioned.</p>
     <p>There was another reason, besides the distance and the clime, why Lord Montfort disliked the
      glorious pile which every Englishman envied him for possession. The mighty domain of Montfort
      was an estate in strict settlement. Its lord could do nothing but enjoy its convenience and
      its beauty, and expend its revenues. Nothing could be sold or bought, not the slightest
      alteration—according to Lord Montfort—be made, without applying to trustees for their
      sanction. Lord Montfort spoke of this pitiable state of affairs as if he were describing the
      serfdom of the Middle Ages. “If I were to pull this bell-rope, and it came down,” he would
      say, “I should have to apply to the trustees before it could be arranged.”</p>
     <p>Such a humiliating state of affairs had induced his lordship, on the very first occasion, to
      expend half a million of accumulations, which were at his own disposal, in the purchase of
      Princedown, which certainly was a very different residence from Montfort Castle, alike in its
      clime and character.</p>
     <p>Princedown was situate in a southern county, hardly on a southern coast, for it was ten
      miles from the sea, though enchanting views of the Channel were frequent and exquisite. It was
      a palace built in old days upon the Downs, but sheltered and screened from every hostile wind.
      The full warmth of the south fell upon the vast but fantastic pile of the Renaissance style,
      said to have been built by that gifted but mysterious individual, John of Padua. The gardens
      were wonderful, terrace upon terrace, and on each terrace a tall fountain. But the most
      peculiar feature was the park, which was undulating and extensive, but its timber entirely
      ilex: single trees of an age and size not common in that tree, and groups and clumps of ilex,
      but always ilex. Beyond the park, and extending far into the horizon, was Princedown forest,
      the dominion of the red deer.</p>
     <p>The Roehamptons and Endymion were the only permanent visitors at Princedown at this moment,
      but every day brought guests who stayed eight-and-forty hours, and then flitted. Lady
      Montfort, like the manager of a theatre, took care that there should be a succession of
      novelties to please or to surprise the wayward audience for whom she had to cater. On the
      whole, Lord Montfort was, for him, in an extremely good humour; never very ill; Princedown was
      the only place where he never was very ill; he was a little excited, too, by the state of
      politics, though he did not exactly know why; “though, I suppose,” he would say to Lord
      Roehampton, “if you do come in again, there will be no more nonsense about O’Connell and all
      that sort of thing. If you are prudent on that head, and carry a moderate fixed duty, not too
      high, say ten shillings—that would satisfy everybody—I do not see why the thing might not go
      on as long as you liked.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Waldershare came down, exuberant with endless combinations of persons and parties. He
      foresaw in all these changes that most providential consummation, the end of the middle
      class.</p>
     <p>Mr. Waldershare had become quite a favourite with Lord Montfort, who delighted to talk with
      him about the Duke of Modena, and imbibe his original views of English History. “Only,” Lord
      Montfort would observe, “the Montforts have so much Church property, and I fancy the Duke of
      Modena would want us to disgorge.”</p>
     <p>St. Barbe had been invited, and made his appearance. There had been a degree of estrangement
      between him and his patron. St. Barbe was very jealous; he was indeed jealous of everybody and
      everything, and of late there was a certain Doctor Comeley, an Oxford don of the new school,
      who had been introduced to Lord Montfort, and was initiating him in all the mysteries of
      Neology. This celebrated divine, who, in a sweet silky voice, quoted Socrates instead of St.
      Paul, and was opposed to all symbols and formulas as essentially unphilosophical, had become
      the hero of “the little dinners” at Montfort House, where St. Barbe had been so long wont to
      shine, and who in consequence himself had become every day more severely orthodox.</p>
     <p>“Perhaps we may meet to-day,” said Endymion one morning to St. Barbe in Pall Mall as they
      were separating. “There is a little dinner at Montfort House.”</p>
     <p>“Confound your little dinners!” exclaimed the indignant St. Barbe; “I hope never to go to
      another little dinner, and especially at Montfort House. I do not want to be asked to dinner
      to tumble and play tricks to amuse my host. I want to be amused myself. One cannot be silent
      at these little dinners, and the consequence is, you say all the good things which are in your
      next number, and when it comes out, people say they have heard them before. No, sir, if Lord
      Montfort, or any other lord, wishes me to dine with him, let him ask me to a banquet of his
      own order, and where I may hold my tongue like the rest of his aristocratic guests.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Trenchard had come down and brought the news that the ministry had resigned, and that
      the Queen had sent for the leader of the opposition, who was in Scotland.</p>
     <p>“I suppose we shall have to go to town,” said Lady Roehampton to her brother, in a room,
      busy and full. “It is so difficult to be alone here,” she continued in a whisper; “let us get
      into the gardens.” And they escaped. And then, when they were out of hearing and of sight of
      any one, she said, “This is a most critical time of your life, Endymion; it makes me very
      anxious. I look upon it as certain that you will be in office, and in all probability under my
      lord. He has said nothing to me about it, but I feel quite assured it will happen. It will be
      a great event. Poor papa began by being an under-secretary of state!” she continued in a moody
      tone, half speaking to herself, “and all seemed so fair then, but he had no root. What I want,
      Endymion, is that you should have a root. There is too much chance and favour in your lot.
      They will fail you some day, some day too when I may not be by you. Even this great opening,
      which is at hand, would never have been at your command, but for a mysterious gift on which
      you never could have counted.”</p>
     <p>“It is very true, Myra, but what then?”</p>
     <p>“Why, then, I think we should guard against such contingencies. You know what is in my mind;
      we have spoken of it before, and not once only. I want you to marry, and you know whom.”</p>
     <p>“Marriage is a serious affair!” said Endymion, with a distressed look.</p>
     <p>“The most serious. It is the principal event for good or for evil in all lives. Had I not
      married, and married as I did, we should not have been here—and where, I dare not think.”</p>
     <p>“Yes; but you made a happy marriage; one of the happiest that was ever known, I think.”</p>
     <p>“And I wish you, Endymion, to make the same. I did not marry for love, though love came, and
      I brought happiness to one who made me happy. But had it been otherwise, if there had been no
      sympathy, or prospect of sympathy, I still should have married, for it was the only chance of
      saving you.”</p>
     <p>“Dearest sister! Everything I have, I owe to you.”</p>
     <p>“It is not much,” said Myra, “but I wish to make it much. Power in every form, and in
      excess, is at your disposal if you be wise. There is a woman, I think with every charm, who
      loves you; her fortune may have no limit; she is a member of one of the most powerful families
      in England—a noble family I may say, for my lord told me last night that Mr. Neuchatel would
      be instantly raised to the peerage, and you hesitate! By all the misery of the past—which
      never can be forgotten—for Heaven’s sake, be wise; do not palter with such a chance.”</p>
     <p>“If all be as you say, Myra, and I have no reason but your word to believe it is so—if, for
      example, of which I never saw any evidence, Mr. Neuchatel would approve, or even tolerate,
      this alliance—I have too deep and sincere a regard for his daughter, founded on much kindness
      to both of us, to mock her with the offer of a heart which she has not gained.”</p>
     <p>“You say you have a deep and sincere regard for Adriana,” said his sister. “Why, what better
      basis for enduring happiness can there be? You are not a man to marry for romantic sentiment,
      and pass your life in writing sonnets to your wife till you find her charms and your
      inspiration alike exhausted; you are already wedded to the State, you have been nurtured in
      the thoughts of great affairs from your very childhood, and even in the darkest hour of our
      horrible adversity. You are a man born for power and high condition, whose name in time ought
      to rank with those of the great statesmen of the continent, the true lords of Europe. Power,
      and power alone, should be your absorbing object, and all the accidents and incidents of life
      should only be considered with reference to that main result.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am only five-and-twenty after all. There is time yet to consider this.”</p>
     <p>“Great men should think of Opportunity, and not of Time. Time is the excuse of feeble and
      puzzled spirits. They make time the sleeping partner of their lives to accomplish what ought
      to be achieved by their own will. In this case, there certainly is no time like the present.
      The opportunity is unrivalled. All your friends would, without an exception, be delighted if
      you now were wise.”</p>
     <p>“I hardly think my friends have given it a thought,” said Endymion, a little flushed.</p>
     <p>“There is nothing that would please Lady Montfort more.”</p>
     <p>He turned pale. “How do you know that?” he inquired.</p>
     <p>“She told me so, and offered to help me in bringing about the result.”</p>
     <p>“Very kind of her! Well, dearest Myra, you and Lord Roehampton have much to think of at this
      anxious moment. Let this matter drop. We have discussed it before, and we have discussed it
      enough. It is more than pain for me to differ from you on any point, but I cannot offer to
      Adriana a heart which belongs to another.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
     <p>All the high expectations of December at Princedown were doomed to disappointment; they were
      a further illustration of Lord Roehampton’s saying, that there was no gambling like politics.
      The leader of the opposition came up to town, but he found nothing but difficulties, and a few
      days before Christmas he had resigned the proffered trust. The protectionist ministry were to
      remain in office, and to repeal the corn laws. The individual who was most baulked by this
      unexpected result was perhaps Lord Roehampton. He was a man who really cared for nothing but
      office and affairs, and being advanced in life, he naturally regretted a lost opportunity. But
      he never showed his annoyance. Always playful, and even taking refuge in a bantering spirit,
      the world seemed to go light with him when everything was dark and everybody despondent.</p>
     <p>The discontent or indignation which the contemplated revolution in policy was calculated to
      excite in the Conservative party generally were to a certain degree neutralised for the moment
      by mysterious and confidential communications, circulated by Mr. Tadpole and the managers of
      the party, that the change was to be accompanied by “immense compensations.” As parliament was
      to meet as soon as convenient after Christmas, and the statement of the regenerated ministry
      was then to be made immediately, every one held his hand, as they all felt the blow must be
      more efficient when the scheme of the government was known.</p>
     <p>The Montforts were obliged to go to their castle, a visit the sad necessity of which the
      formation of a new government, at one time, they had hoped might have prevented. The
      Roehamptons passed their Christmas with Mr. Sidney Wilton at Gaydene, where Endymion also and
      many of the opposition were guests. Waldershare took refuge with his friends the Beaumaris’,
      full of revenge and unceasing combinations. He took down St. Barbe with him, whose services in
      the session might be useful. There had been a little misunderstanding between these two
      eminent personages during the late season. St. Barbe was not satisfied with his position in
      the new journal which Waldershare had established. He affected to have been ill-treated and
      deceived, and this with a mysterious shake of the head which seemed to intimate state secrets
      that might hereafter be revealed. The fact is, St. Barbe’s political articles were so absurd
      that it was impossible to print them; but as his name stood high as a clever writer on matters
      with which he was acquainted, they permitted him, particularly as they were bound to pay him a
      high salary, to contribute essays on the social habits and opinions of the day, which he
      treated in a happy and taking manner. St. Barbe himself had such quick perception of
      peculiarities, so fine a power of observation, and so keen a sense of the absurd, that when he
      revealed in confidence the causes of his discontent, it was almost impossible to believe that
      he was entirely serious. It seems that he expected this connection with the journal in
      question to have been, to use his own phrase, “a closet affair,” and that he was habitually to
      have been introduced by the backstairs of the palace to the presence of Royalty to receive
      encouragement and inspiration. “I do not complain of the pay,” he added, “though I could get
      more by writing for Shuffle and Screw, but I expected a decoration. However, I shall probably
      stand for next parliament on the principles of the Mountain, so perhaps it is just as
      well.”</p>
     <p>Parliament soon met, and that session began which will long be memorable. The “immense
      compensations” were nowhere. Waldershare, who had only waited for this, resigned his office as
      Under-Secretary of State. This was a bad example and a blow, but nothing compared to the
      resignation of his great office in the Household by the Earl of Beaumaris. This involved
      unhappily the withdrawal of Lady Beaumaris, under whose bright, inspiring roof the Tory party
      had long assembled, sanguine and bold. Other considerable peers followed the precedent of Lord
      Beaumaris, and withdrew their support from the ministry. Waldershare moved the amendment to
      the first reading of the obnoxious bill; but although defeated by a considerable majority, the
      majority was mainly formed by members of the opposition. Among these was Mr. Ferrars, who it
      was observed never opened his lips during the whole session.</p>
     <p>This was not the case with Mr. Bertie Tremaine and the school of Pythagoras. The opportunity
      long waited for had at length arrived. There was a great parliamentary connection deserted by
      their leaders. This distinguished rank and file required officers. The cabinet of Mr. Bertie
      Tremaine was ready, and at their service. Mr. Bertie Tremaine seconded the amendment of
      Waldershare, and took the occasion of expounding the new philosophy, which seemed to combine
      the principles of Bentham with the practice of Lord Liverpool. “I offered to you this,” he
      said reproachfully to Endymion; “you might have been my secretary of state. Mr. Tremaine
      Bertie will now take it. He would rather have had an embassy, but he must make the
      sacrifice.”</p>
     <p>The debates during the session were much carried on by the Pythagoreans, who never ceased
      chattering. They had men ready for every branch of the subject, and the debate was often
      closed by their chief in mystical sentences, which they cheered like awestruck zealots.</p>
     <p>The great bill was carried, but the dark hour of retribution at length arrived. The
      ministry, though sanguine to the last of success, and not without cause, were completely and
      ignominiously defeated. The new government, long prepared, was at once formed. Lord Roehampton
      again became secretary of state, and he appointed Endymion to the post under him. “I shall not
      press you unfairly,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine to Endymion, with encouraging condescension. “I
      wish my men for a season to comprehend what is a responsible opposition. I am sorry Hortensius
      is your solicitor-general, for I had intended him always for my chancellor.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVI</head>
     <p>Very shortly after the prorogation of parliament, an incident occurred which materially
      affected the position of Endymion. Lord Roehampton had a serious illness. Having a fine
      constitution, he apparently completely rallied from the attack, and little was known of it by
      the public. The world also, at that moment, was as usual much dispersed and distracted;
      dispersed in many climes, and distracted by the fatigue and hardships they annually endure,
      and which they call relaxation. Even the colleagues of the great statesman were scattered, and
      before they had realised that he had been seriously ill, they read of him in the fulfilment of
      his official duties. But there was no mistake as to his state under his own roof. Lord
      Roehampton had, throughout the later period of his life, been in the habit of working at
      night. It was only at night that he could command that abstraction necessary for the
      consideration of great affairs. He was also a real worker. He wrote his own despatches,
      whenever they referred to matters of moment. He left to the permanent staff of his office
      little but the fulfilment of duties which, though heavy and multifarious, were duties of
      routine. The composition of these despatches was a source to Lord Roehampton of much
      gratification and excitement. They were of European fame, and their terse argument, their
      clear determination, and often their happy irony, were acknowledged in all the cabinets, and
      duly apprehended.</p>
     <p>The physicians impressed upon Lady Roehampton that this night-work must absolutely cease. A
      neglect of their advice must lead to serious consequences; following it, there was no reason
      why her husband should not live for years, and continue to serve the State. Lord Roehampton
      must leave the House of Commons; he must altogether change the order of his life; he must seek
      more amusement in society, and yet keep early hours; and then he would find himself fresh and
      vigorous in the morning, and his work would rather benefit than distress him. It was all an
      affair of habit.</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton threw all her energies into this matter. She entertained for her lord a
      reverential affection, and his life to her seemed a precious deposit, of which she was the
      trustee. She succeeded where the physicians would probably have failed. Towards the end of the
      year Lord Roehampton was called up to the House of Lords for one of his baronies, and Endymion
      was informed that when parliament met, he would have to represent the Foreign Office in the
      House of Commons.</p>
     <p>Waldershare heartily congratulated him. “You have got what I most wished to have in the
      world; but I will not envy you, for envy is a vile passion. You have the good fortune to serve
      a genial chief. I had to deal with a Harley,—cold, suspicious, ambiguous, pretending to be
      profound, and always in a state of perplexity.”</p>
     <p>It was not a very agreeable session. The potato famine did something more than repeal the
      corn laws. It proved that there was no floating capital left in the country; and when the
      Barings and Rothschilds combined, almost as much from public spirit as from private
      speculation, to raise a loan of a few millions for the minister, they absolutely found the
      public purse was exhausted, and had to supply the greater portion of the amount from their own
      resources. In one of the many financial debates that consequently occurred, Trenchard
      established himself by a clear and comprehensive view of the position of affairs, and by
      modestly reminding the House, that a year ago he had predicted the present condition of
      things, and indicated its inevitable cause.</p>
     <p>This was the great speech on a great night, and Mr. Bertie Tremaine walked home with
      Trenchard. It was observed that Mr. Bertie Tremaine always walked home with the member who had
      made the speech of the evening.</p>
     <p>“Your friends did not behave well to you,” he said in a hollow voice to Trenchard. “They
      ought to have made you Secretary of the Treasury. Think of this. It is an important post, and
      may lead to anything; and, so far as I am concerned, it would give me real pleasure to see
      it.”</p>
     <p>But besides the disquietude of domestic affairs, famine and failures competing in horrible
      catastrophe and the Bank Act suspended, as the year advanced matters on the Continent became
      not less dark and troubled. Italy was mysteriously agitated; the pope announced himself a
      reformer; there were disturbances in Milan, Ancona, and Ferrara; the Austrians threatened the
      occupation of several States, and Sardinia offered to defend His Holiness from the Austrians.
      In addition to all this, there were reform banquets in France, a civil war in Switzerland, and
      the King of Prussia thought it prudent to present his subjects with a Constitution.</p>
     <p>The Count of Ferroll about this time made a visit to England. He was always a welcome guest
      there, and had received the greatest distinction which England could bestow upon a foreigner;
      he had been elected an honorary member of White’s. “You may have troubles here,” he said to
      Lady Montfort, “but they will pass; you will have mealy potatoes again and plenty of bank
      notes, but we shall not get off so cheaply. Everything is quite rotten throughout the
      Continent. This year is tranquillity to what the next will be. There is not a throne in Europe
      worth a year’s purchase. My worthy master wants me to return home and be minister; I am to
      fashion for him a new constitution. I will never have anything to do with new constitutions;
      their inventors are always the first victims. Instead of making a constitution, he should make
      a country, and convert his heterogeneous domains into a patriotic dominion.”</p>
     <p>“But how is that to be done?”</p>
     <p>“There is only one way; by blood and iron.”</p>
     <p>“My dear count, you shock me!”</p>
     <p>“I shall have to shock you a great deal more before the inevitable is brought about.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I am glad that there is something,” said Lady Montfort, “which is inevitable. I hope
      it will come soon. I am sure this country is ruined. What with cheap bread at famine prices
      and these railroads, we seem quite finished. I thought one operation was to counteract the
      other; but they appear both to turn out equally fatal.”</p>
     <p>Endymion had now one of those rare opportunities which, if men be equal to them, greatly
      affect their future career. As the session advanced, debates on foreign affairs became
      frequent and deeply interesting. So far as the ministry was concerned, the burthen of these
      fell on the Under-Secretary of State. He was never wanting. The House felt that he had not
      only the adequate knowledge, but that it was knowledge perfectly digested; that his remarks
      and conduct were those of a man who had given constant thought to his duties, and was master
      of his subject. His oratorical gifts also began to be recognised. The power and melody of his
      voice had been before remarked, and that is a gift which much contributes to success in a
      popular assembly. He was ready without being too fluent. There were light and shade in his
      delivery. He repressed his power of sarcasm; but if unjustly and inaccurately attacked, he
      could be keen. Over his temper he had a complete control; if, indeed, his entire insensibility
      to violent language on the part of an opponent was not organic. All acknowledged his courtesy,
      and both sides sympathised with a young man who proved himself equal to no ordinary
      difficulties. In a word, Endymion was popular, and that popularity was not diminished by the
      fact of his being the brother of Lady Roehampton, who exercised great influence in society,
      and who was much beloved.</p>
     <p>As the year advanced external affairs became daily more serious, and the country
      congratulated itself that its interests were entrusted to a minister of the experience and
      capacity of Lord Roehampton. That statesman seemed never better than when the gale ran high.
      Affairs in France began to assume the complexion that the Count of Ferroll had prophetically
      announced. If a crash occurred in that quarter, Lord Roehampton felt that all Europe might be
      in a blaze. Affairs were never more serious than at the turn of the year. Lord Roehampton told
      his wife that their holidays must be spent in St. James’ Square, for he could not leave
      London; but he wished her to go to Gaydene, where they had been invited by Mr. Sidney Wilton
      to pass their Christmas as usual. Nothing, however, would induce her to quit his side. He
      seemed quite well, but the pressure of affairs was extreme; and sometimes, against all her
      remonstrances, he was again working at night. Such remonstrances on other subjects would
      probably have been successful, for her influence over him was extreme. But to a minister
      responsible for the interests of a great country they are vain, futile, impossible. One might
      as well remonstrate with an officer on the field of battle on the danger he was incurring. She
      said to him one night in his library, where she paid him a little visit before she retired,
      “My heart, I know it is no use my saying anything, and yet—remember your promise. This
      night-work makes me very unhappy.”</p>
     <p>“I remember my promise, and I will try not to work at night again in a hurry, but I must
      finish this despatch. If I did not, I could not sleep, and you know sleep is what I
      require.”</p>
     <p>“Good night, then.”</p>
     <p>He looked up with his winning smile, and held out his lips. “Kiss me,” he said; “I never
      felt better.”</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton after a time slumbered; how long she knew not, but when she woke, her lord
      was not at her side. She struck a light and looked at her watch. It was past three o’clock;
      she jumped out of bed, and, merely in her slippers and her <hi>robe de chambre</hi>, descended
      to the library. It was a large, long room, and Lord Roehampton worked at the extreme end of
      it. The candles were nearly burnt out. As she approached him, she perceived that he was
      leaning back in his chair. When she reached him, she observed he was awake, but he did not
      seem to recognise her. A dreadful feeling came over her. She took his hand. It was quite cold.
      Her intellect for an instant seemed to desert her. She looked round her with an air void
      almost of intelligence, and then rushing to the bell she continued ringing it till some of the
      household appeared. A medical man was near at hand, and in a few minutes arrived, but it was a
      bootless visit. All was over, and all had been over, he said, “for some time.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
     <p>“Well, you have made up your government?” asked Lady Montfort of the prime minister as he
      entered her boudoir. He shook his head.</p>
     <p>“Have you seen her?” he inquired.</p>
     <p>“No, not yet; I suppose she will see me as soon as any one.”</p>
     <p>“I am told she is utterly overwhelmed.”</p>
     <p>“She was devoted to him; it was the happiest union I ever knew; but Lady Roehampton is not
      the woman to be utterly overwhelmed. She has too imperial a spirit for that.”</p>
     <p>“It is a great misfortune,” said the prime minister. “We have not been lucky since we took
      the reins.”</p>
     <p>“Well, there is no use in deploring. There is nobody else to take the reins, so you may defy
      misfortunes. The question now is, what are you going to do?”</p>
     <p>“Well, there seems to me only one thing to do. We must put Rawchester there.”</p>
     <p>“Rawchester!” exclaimed Lady Montfort, “what, ‘Niminy-Piminy’?”</p>
     <p>“Well, he is conciliatory,” said the premier, “and if you are not very clever, you should be
      conciliatory.”</p>
     <p>“He never knows his own mind for a week together.”</p>
     <p>“We will take care of his mind,” said the prime minister, “but he has travelled a good deal,
      and knows the public men.”</p>
     <p>“Yes,” said Lady Montfort, “and the public men, I fear, know him.”</p>
     <p>“Then he can make a good House of Lords’ speech, and we have a first-rate man in the
      Commons; so it will do.”</p>
     <p>“I do not think your first-rate man in the House of Commons will remain,” said Lady Montfort
      drily.</p>
     <p>“You do not mean that?” said the prime minister, evidently alarmed.</p>
     <p>“His health is delicate,” said Lady Montfort; “had it not been for his devotion to Lord
      Roehampton, I know he thought of travelling for a couple of years.”</p>
     <p>“Ferrars’ health delicate?” said the premier; “I thought he was the picture of health and
      youthful vigour. Health is one of the elements to be considered in calculating the career of a
      public man, and I have always predicted an eminent career for Ferrars, because, in addition to
      his remarkable talents, he had apparently such a fine constitution.”</p>
     <p>“No health could stand working under Lord Rawchester.”</p>
     <p>“Well, but what am I to do? I cannot make Mr. Ferrars secretary of state.”</p>
     <p>“Why not?”</p>
     <p>The prime minister looked considerably perplexed. Such a promotion could not possibly have
      occurred to him. Though a man of many gifts, and a statesman, he had been educated in high
      Whig routine, and the proposition of Lady Montfort was like recommending him to make a curate
      a bishop.</p>
     <p>“Well,” he said, “Ferrars is a very clever fellow. He is our rising young man, and there is
      no doubt that, if his health is not so delicate as you fear, he will mount high; but though
      our rising young man, he is a young man, much too young to be a secretary of state. He wants
      age, larger acquaintance with affairs, greater position, and more root in the country.”</p>
     <p>“What was Mr. Canning’s age, who held Mr. Ferrars’ office, when he was made secretary of
      state? and what root in the country had he?”</p>
     <p>When the prime minister got back to Downing Street, he sent immediately for his head whip.
      “Look after Ferrars,” he said; “they are trying to induce him to resign office. If he does,
      our embarrassments will be extreme. Lord Rawchester will be secretary of state; send a
      paragraph at once to the papers announcing it. But look after Ferrars, and immediately, and
      report to me.”</p>
     <p>Lord Roehampton had a large entailed estate, though his affairs were always in a state of
      confusion. That seems almost the inevitable result of being absorbed in the great business of
      governing mankind. If there be exceptions among statesmen of the highest class, they will
      generally be found among those who have been chiefly in opposition, and so have had leisure
      and freedom of mind sufficient to manage their estates. Lord Roehampton had, however,
      extensive powers of charging his estate in lieu of dower, and he had employed them to their
      utmost extent; so his widow was well provided for. The executors were Mr. Sidney Wilton and
      Endymion.</p>
     <p>After a short period, Lady Roehampton saw Adriana, and not very long after, Lady Montfort.
      They both of them, from that time, were her frequent, if not constant, companions, but she saw
      no one else. Once only, since the terrible event, was she seen by the world, and that was when
      a tall figure, shrouded in the darkest attire, attended as chief mourner at the burial of her
      lord in Westminster Abbey. She remained permanently in London, not only because she had no
      country house, but because she wished to be with her brother. As time advanced, she frequently
      saw Mr. Sidney Wilton, who, being chief executor of the will, and charged with all her
      affairs, had necessarily much on which to consult her. One of the greatest difficulties was to
      provide her with a suitable residence, for of course, she was not to remain in the family
      mansion in St. James’ Square. That difficulty was ultimately overcome in a manner highly
      interesting to her feelings. Her father’s mansion in Hill Street, where she had passed her
      prosperous and gorgeous childhood, was in the market, and she was most desirous to occupy it.
      “It will seem like a great step towards the restoration,” she said to Endymion. “My plans are,
      that you should give up the Albany, and that we should live together. I should like to live
      together in Hill Street; I should like to see our nursery once more. The past then will be a
      dream, or at least all the past that is disagreeable. My fortune is yours; as we are twins, it
      is likely that I may live as long as you do. But I wish you to be the master of the house, and
      in time receive your friends in a manner becoming your position. I do not think that I shall
      ever much care to go out again, but I may help you at home, and then you can invite women; a
      mere bachelor’s house is always dull.”</p>
     <p>There was one difficulty still in this arrangement. The mansion in Hill Street was not to be
      let, it was for sale, and the price naturally for such a mansion in such a situation, was
      considerable; quite beyond the means of Lady Roehampton who had a very ample income, but no
      capital. This difficulty, however, vanished in a moment. Mr. Sidney Wilton purchased the
      house; he wanted an investment, and this was an excellent one; so Lady Roehampton became his
      tenant.</p>
     <p>The change was great in the life of Myra, and she felt it. She loved her lord, and had cut
      off her beautiful hair, which reached almost to her feet, and had tied it round his neck in
      his coffin. But Myra, notwithstanding she was a woman, and a woman of transcendent beauty, had
      never had a romance of the heart. Until she married, her pride and love for her brother, which
      was part of her pride, had absorbed her being. When she married, and particularly as time
      advanced, she felt all the misery of her existence had been removed, and nothing could exceed
      the tenderness and affectionate gratitude, and truly unceasing devotion, which she extended to
      the gifted being to who she owed this deliverance. But it was not in the nature of things that
      she could experience those feelings which still echo in the heights of Meilleraie, and
      compared with which all the glittering accidents of fortune sink into insignificance.</p>
     <p>The year rolled on, an agitated year of general revolution. Endymion himself was rarely in
      society, for all the time which the House of Commons spared to him he wished chiefly to
      dedicate to his sister. His brougham was always ready to take him up to Hill Street for one of
      those somewhat hurried, but amusing little dinners, which break the monotony of parliamentary
      life. And sometimes he brought a companion, generally Mr. Wilton, and sometimes they met Lady
      Montfort or Adriana, now ennobled as the daughter of Lord Hainault. There was much to talk
      about, even if they did not talk about themselves and their friends, for every day brought
      great events, fresh insurrections, new constitutions, changes of dynasties, assassinations of
      ministers, states of siege, evanescent empires, and premature republics.</p>
     <p>On one occasion, having previously prepared his sister, who seemed not uninterested by the
      suggestion, Endymion brought Thornberry to dine in Hill Street. There was no one else present
      except Adriana. Job was a great admirer of Lady Roehampton, but was a little awestruck by her.
      He remembered her in her childhood, a beautiful being who never smiled. She received him very
      graciously, and after dinner, inviting him to sit by her on the sofa, referred with delicacy
      to old times.</p>
     <p>“Your ladyship,” said Thornberry, “would not know that I live myself now at Hurstley.”</p>
     <p>“Indeed!” said Myra, unaffectedly surprised.</p>
     <p>“Well, it happened in this way; my father now is in years, and can no longer visit us as he
      occasionally did in Lancashire; so wishing to see us all, at least once more, we agreed to pay
      him a visit. I do not know how it exactly came about, but my wife took a violent fancy to the
      place. They all received us very kindly. The good rector and his dear kind wife made it very
      pleasant, and the archbishop was there—whom we used to call Mr. Nigel—only think! That is a
      wonderful affair. He is not at all high and mighty, but talked with us, and walked with us,
      just the same as in old days. He took a great fancy to my boy, John Hampden, and, after all,
      my boy is to go to Oxford, and not to Owens College, as I had first intended.”</p>
     <p>“That is a great change.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I wanted him to go to Owens College, I confess, but I did not care so much about Mill
      Hill. That was his mother’s fancy; she was very strong about that. It is a Nonconformist
      school, but I am not a Nonconformist. I do not much admire dogmas, but I am a Churchman as my
      fathers were. However, John Hampden is not to go to Mill Hill. He has gone to a sort of
      college near Oxford, which the archbishop recommended to us; the principal, and all the tutors
      are clergyman—of course of our Church. My wife was quite delighted with it all.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that is a good thing.”</p>
     <p>“And so,” continued Thornberry, “she got it into her head she should like to live at
      Hurstley, and I took the place. I am afraid I have been foolish enough to lay out a great deal
      of money there—for a place not my own. Your ladyship would not know the old hall. I have, what
      they call, restored it, and upon my word, except the new hall of the Clothworkers’ Company,
      where I dined the other day, I do not know anything of the kind that is prettier.”</p>
     <p>“The dear old hall!” murmured Lady Roehampton.</p>
     <p>In time, though no one mentioned it, everybody thought that if an alliance ultimately took
      place between Lady Roehampton and Mr. Sidney Wilton, it would be the most natural thing in the
      world, and everybody would approve it. True, he was her father’s friend, and much her senior,
      but then he was still good-looking, very clever, very much considered, and lord of a large
      estate, and at any rate he was a younger man than her late husband.</p>
     <p>When these thoughts became more rife in society, and began to take the form of speech, the
      year was getting old, and this reminds us of a little incident which took place many months
      previously, at the beginning of the year, and which we ought to record.</p>
     <p>Shortly after the death of Lord Roehampton, Prince Florestan called one morning in St.
      James’ Square. He said he would not ask Lady Roehampton to see him, but he was obliged
      suddenly to leave England, and he did not like to depart without personally inquiring after
      her. He left a letter and a little packet. And the letter ran thus:</p>
     <p>“I am obliged, madam, to leave England suddenly, and it is probable that we shall never meet
      again. I should be happy if I had your prayers! This little jewel enclosed belonged to my
      mother, the Queen Agrippina. She told me that I was never to part with it, except to somebody
      I loved as much as herself. There is only one person in the world to whom I owe affection. It
      is to her who from the first was always kind to me, and who, through dreary years of danger
      and anxiety, has been the charm and consolation of the life of</p>
     <p>“Florestan.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
     <p>On the evening of the day on which Prince Florestan personally left the letter with Lady
      Roehampton, he quitted London with the Duke of St. Angelo and his aides-de-camp, and,
      embarking in his steam yacht, which was lying at Southampton, quitted England. They pursued a
      prosperous course for about a week, when they passed through the Straits of Gibraltar, and,
      not long afterwards, cast anchor in a small and solitary bay. There the prince and his
      companions, and half-a-dozen servants, well armed and in military attire, left the yacht, and
      proceeded on foot into the country for a short distance, when they arrived at a large
      farmhouse. Here, it was evident, they were expected. Men came forward with many horses, and
      mounted, and accompanied the party which had arrived. They advanced about ten miles, and
      halted as they were approaching a small but fortified town.</p>
     <p>The prince sent the Duke of St. Angelo forward to announce his arrival to the governor, and
      to require him to surrender. The governor, however, refused, and ordered the garrison to fire
      on the invaders. This they declined to do; the governor, with many ejaculations, and stamping
      with rage, broke his sword, and the prince entered the town. He was warmly received, and the
      troops, amounting to about twelve hundred men, placed themselves at his disposal. The prince
      remained at this town only a couple of hours, and at the head of his forces advanced into the
      country. At a range of hills he halted, sent out reconnoitring parties, and pitched his camp.
      In the morning, the Marquis of Vallombrosa, with a large party of gentlemen well mounted,
      arrived, and were warmly greeted. The prince learnt from them that the news of his invasion
      had reached the governor of the province, who was at one of the most considerable cities of
      the kingdom, with a population exceeding two hundred thousand, and with a military division
      for its garrison. “They will not wait for our arrival,” said Vallombrosa, “but, trusting to
      their numbers, will come out and attack us.”</p>
     <p>The news of the scouts being that the mountain passes were quite unoccupied by the enemy,
      the prince determined instantly to continue his advance, and take up a strong position on the
      other side of the range, and await his fate. The passage was well effected, and on the fourth
      day of the invasion the advanced guard of the enemy were in sight. The prince commanded that
      no one should attend him, but alone and tying a white handkerchief round his sword, he
      galloped up to the hostile lines, and said in a clear, loud voice, “My men, this is the sword
      of my father!”</p>
     <p>“Florestan for ever!” was the only and universal reply. The cheers of the advanced guard
      reached and were re-echoed by the main body. The commander-in-chief, bareheaded, came up to
      give in his allegiance and receive his majesty’s orders. They were for immediate progress, and
      at the head of the army which had been sent out to destroy him, Florestan in due course
      entered the enthusiastic city which recognised him as its sovereign. The city was illuminated,
      and he went to the opera in the evening. The singing was not confined to the theatre. During
      the whole night the city itself was one song of joy and triumph, and that night no one
      slept.</p>
     <p>After this there was no trouble and no delay. It was a triumphal march. Every town opened
      its gates, and devoted municipalities proffered golden keys. Every village sent forth its
      troop of beautiful maidens, scattering roses, and singing the national anthem which had been
      composed by Queen Agrippina. On the tenth day of the invasion King Florestan, utterly
      unopposed, entered the magnificent capital of his realm, and slept in the purple bed which had
      witnessed his princely birth.</p>
     <p>Among all the strange revolutions of this year, this adventure of Florestan was not the
      least interesting to the English people. Although society had not smiled on him, he had always
      been rather a favourite with the bulk of the population. His fine countenance, his capital
      horsemanship, his graceful bow that always won a heart, his youth, and love of sport, his
      English education, and the belief that he was sincere in his regard for the country where he
      had been so long a guest, were elements of popularity that, particularly now he was
      successful, were unmistakable. And certainly Lady Roehampton, in her solitude, did not
      disregard his career or conduct. They were naturally often in her thoughts, for there was
      scarcely a day in which his name did not figure in the newspapers, and always in connection
      with matters of general interest and concern. The government he established was liberal, but
      it was discreet, and, though conciliatory, firm. “If he declares for the English alliance,”
      said Waldershare, “he is safe;” and he did declare for the English alliance, and the English
      people were very pleased by his declaration, which in their apprehension meant national
      progress, the amelioration of society, and increased exports.</p>
     <p>The main point, however, which interested his subjects was his marriage. That was both a
      difficult and a delicate matter to decide. The great continental dynasties looked with some
      jealousy and suspicion on him, and the small reigning houses, who were all allied with the
      great continental dynasties, thought it prudent to copy their example. All these reigning
      families, whether large or small, were themselves in a perplexed and alarmed position at this
      period, very disturbed about their present, and very doubtful about their future. At last it
      was understood that a Princess of Saxe-Babel, though allied with royal and imperial houses,
      might share the diadem of a successful adventurer, and then in time, and when it had been
      sufficiently reiterated, paragraphs appeared unequivocally contradicting the statement,
      followed with agreeable assurances that it was unlikely that a Princess of Saxe-Babel, allied
      with royal and imperial houses, should unite herself to a parvenu monarch, however powerful.
      Then in turn these articles were stigmatised as libels, and entirely unauthorised, and no less
      a personage than a princess of the house of Saxe-Genesis was talked of as the future queen;
      but on referring to the “Almanach de Gotha,” it was discovered that family had been extinct
      since the first French Revolution. So it seemed at last that nothing was certain, except that
      his subjects were very anxious that King Florestan should present them with a queen.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
     <p>As time flew on, the friends of Lady Roehampton thought and spoke, with anxiety about her
      re-entrance into society. Mr. Sidney Wilton had lent Gaydene to her for the autumn, when he
      always visited Scotland, and the winter had passed away uninterruptedly, at a charming and
      almost unknown watering-place, where she seemed the only visitant, and where she wandered
      about in silence on the sands. The time was fast approaching when the inevitable year of
      seclusion would expire, and Lady Roehampton gave no indication of any change in her life and
      habits. At length, after many appeals, and expostulations, and entreaties, and little scenes,
      the second year of the widowhood having advanced some months, it was decided that Lady
      Roehampton should re-enter society, and the occasion on which this was to take place was no
      mean one.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort was to give a ball early in June, and Royalty itself was to be her guests. The
      entertainments at Montfort House were always magnificent, but this was to exceed accustomed
      splendour. All the world was to be there, and all the world, who were not invited, were in as
      much despair as if they had lost their fortune or their character.</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton had a passion for light, provided the light was not supplied by gas or oil.
      Her saloons, even when alone, were always brilliantly illuminated. She held that the moral
      effect of such a circumstance on her temperament was beneficial, and not slight. It is a rare,
      but by no means a singular, belief. When she descended into her drawing-room on the critical
      night, its resplendence was some preparation for the scene which awaited her. She stood for a
      moment before the tall mirror which reflected her whole person. What were her thoughts? What
      was the impression that the fair vision conveyed?</p>
     <p>Her countenance was grave, but it was not sad. Myra had now completed, or was on the point
      of completing, her thirtieth year. She was a woman of transcendent beauty; perhaps she might
      justly be described as the most beautiful woman then alive. Time had even improved her
      commanding mien, the graceful sweep of her figure and the voluptuous undulation of her
      shoulders; but time also had spared those charms which are more incidental to early youth, the
      splendour of her complexion, the whiteness of her teeth, and the lustre of her violet eyes.
      She had cut off in her grief the profusion of her dark chestnut locks, that once reached to
      her feet, and she wore her hair as, what was then and perhaps is now called, a crop, but it
      was luxuriant in natural quantity and rich in colour, and most effectively set off her arched
      brow, and the oval of her fresh and beauteous cheek. The crop was crowned to-night by a
      coronet of brilliants.</p>
     <p>“Your carriage is ready, my lady,” said a servant; “but there is a gentleman below who has
      brought a letter for your ladyship, and which, he says, he must personally deliver to you,
      madam. I told him your ladyship was going out and could not see him, but he put his card in
      this envelope, and requested that I would hand it to you, madam. He says he will only deliver
      the letter to your ladyship, and not detain you a moment.”</p>
     <p>Lady Roehampton opened the envelope, and read the card, “The Duke of St. Angelo.”</p>
     <p>“The Duke of St. Angelo!” she murmured to herself, and looked for a moment abstracted. Then
      turning to the servant, she said, “He must be shown up.”</p>
     <p>“Madam,” said the duke as he entered, and bowed with much ceremony, “I am ashamed of
      appearing to be an intruder, but my commands were to deliver this letter to your ladyship
      immediately on my arrival, whatever the hour. I have only this instant arrived. We had a bad
      passage. I know your ladyship’s carriage is at the door. I will redeem my pledge and not
      trespass on your time for one instant. If your ladyship requires me, I am ever at your
      command.”</p>
     <p>“At Carlton Gardens?”</p>
     <p>“No; at our embassy.”</p>
     <p>“His Majesty, I hope, is well?”</p>
     <p>“In every sense, my lady,” and bowing to the ground the duke withdrew.</p>
     <p>She broke the seal of the letter while still standing, and held it to a sconce that was on
      the mantel-piece, and then she read:</p>
     <p>“You were the only person I called upon when I suddenly left England. I had no hope of
      seeing you, but it was the homage of gratitude and adoration. Great events have happened since
      we last met. I have realised my dreams, dreams which I sometimes fancied you, and you alone,
      did not depreciate or discredit, and, in the sweetness of your charity, would not have been
      sorry were they accomplished.</p>
     <p>“I have established what I believe to be a strong and just government in a great kingdom. I
      have not been uninfluenced by the lessons of wisdom I gained in your illustrious land. I have
      done some things which it was a solace for me to believe you would not altogether
      disapprove.</p>
     <p>“My subjects are anxious that the dynasty I have re-established should not be evanescent. Is
      it too bold to hope that I may find a companion in you to charm and to counsel me? I can offer
      you nothing equal to your transcendent merit, but I can offer you the heart and the throne
      of</p>
     <p>“Florestan.”</p>
     <p>Still holding the letter in one hand, she looked around as if some one might be present. Her
      cheek was scarlet, and there was for a moment an expression of wildness in her glance. Then
      she paced the saloon with an agitated step, and then she read the letter again and again, and
      still she paced the saloon. The whole history of her life revolved before her; every scene,
      every character, every thought, and sentiment, and passion. The brightness of her nursery
      days, and Hurstley with all its miseries, and Hainault with its gardens, and the critical
      hour, which had opened to her a future of such unexpected lustre and happiness.</p>
     <p>The clock had struck more than once during this long and terrible soliloquy, wherein she had
      to search and penetrate her inmost heart, and now it struck two. She started, and hurriedly
      rang the bell.</p>
     <p>“I shall not want the carriage to-night,” she said, and when again alone, she sat down and,
      burying her face in her alabaster arms, for a long time remained motionless.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
     <p>Had he been a youth about to make a <hi>debut</hi> in the great world, Sidney Wilton could
      not have been more agitated than he felt at the prospect of the fete at Montfort House. Lady
      Roehampton, after nearly two years of retirement, was about to re-enter society. During this
      interval she had not been estranged from him. On the contrary, he had been her frequent and
      customary companion. Except Adriana, and Lady Montfort, and her brother, it might almost be
      said, her only one. Why then was he agitated? He had been living in a dream for two years,
      cherishing wild thoughts of exquisite happiness. He would have been content, had the dream
      never been disturbed; but this return to hard and practical life of her whose unconscious
      witchery had thrown a spell over his existence, roused him to the reality of his position, and
      it was one of terrible emotion.</p>
     <p>During the life of her husband, Sidney Wilton had been the silent adorer of Myra. With every
      accomplishment and every advantage that are supposed to make life delightful—a fine
      countenance, a noble mien, a manner natural and attractive, an ancient lineage, and a vast
      estate—he was the favourite of society, who did more than justice to his talents, which,
      though not brilliant, were considerable, and who could not too much appreciate the high tone
      of his mind; his generosity and courage, and true patrician spirit which inspired all his
      conduct, and guided him ever to do that which was liberal, and gracious, and just.</p>
     <p>There was only one fault which society found in Sidney Wilton; he would not marry. This was
      provoking, because he was the man of all others who ought to marry, and make a heroine happy.
      Society did not give it up till he was forty, about the time he became acquainted with Lady
      Roehampton; and that incident threw no light on his purposes or motives, for he was as
      discreet as he was devoted, and Myra herself was unconscious of his being anything to her save
      the dearest friend of her father, and the most cherished companion of her husband.</p>
     <p>When one feels deeply, one is apt to act suddenly, perhaps rashly. There are moments in life
      when suspense can be borne no longer. And Sidney Wilton, who had been a silent votary for more
      than ten years, now felt that the slightest delay in his fate would be intolerable. It was the
      ball at Montfort House that should be the scene of this decision of destiny.</p>
     <p>She was about to re-enter society, radiant as the morn, amid flowers and music, and all the
      accidents of social splendour. His sympathetic heart had been some solace to her in her sorrow
      and her solitude. Now, in the joyous blaze of life, he was resolved to ask her whether it were
      impossible that they should never again separate, and in the crowd, as well as when alone,
      feel their mutual devotion.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilton was among those who went early to Montfort House, which was not his wont; but he
      was restless and disquieted. She could hardly have arrived; but there would be some there who
      would speak of her. That was a great thing. Sidney Wilton had arrived at that state when
      conversation can only interest on one subject. When a man is really in love, he is disposed to
      believe that, like himself, everybody is thinking of the person who engrosses his brain and
      heart.</p>
     <p>The magnificent saloons, which in half an hour would be almost impassable, were only
      sprinkled with guests, who, however, were constantly arriving. Mr. Wilton looked about him in
      vain for the person who, he was quite sure, could not then be present. He lingered by the side
      of Lady Montfort, who bowed to those who came, but who could spare few consecutive words, even
      to Mr. Wilton, for her watchful eye expected every moment to be summoned to descend her marble
      staircase and receive her royal guests.</p>
     <p>The royal guests arrived; there was a grand stir, and many gracious bows, and some cordial,
      but dignified, shake-hands. The rooms were crowded; yet space in the ball-room was well
      preserved, so that the royal vision might range with facility from its golden chairs to the
      beauteous beings, and still more beautiful costumes, displaying with fervent loyalty their
      fascinating charms.</p>
     <p>There was a new band to-night, that had come from some distant but celebrated capital;
      musicians known by fame to everybody, but whom nobody had ever heard. They played wonderfully
      on instruments of new invention, and divinely upon old ones. It was impossible that anything
      could be more gay and inspiring than their silver bugles, and their carillons of tinkling
      bells.</p>
     <p>They found an echo in the heart of Sidney Wilton, who, seated near the entrance of the
      ball-room, watched every arrival with anxious expectation. But the anxiety vanished for a
      moment under the influence of the fantastic and frolic strain. It seemed a harbinger of
      happiness and joy. He fell into a reverie, and wandered with a delightful companion in castles
      of perpetual sunshine, and green retreats, and pleasant terraces.</p>
     <p>But the lady never came.</p>
     <p>“Where can your sister be?” said Lady Montfort to Endymion. “She promised me to come early;
      something must have happened. Is she ill?”</p>
     <p>“Quite well; I saw her before I left Hill Street. She wished me to come alone, as she would
      not be here early.</p>
     <p>“I hope she will be in time for the royal supper table; I quite count on her.”</p>
     <p>“She is sure to be here.”</p>
     <p>Lord Hainault was in earnest conversation with Baron Sergius, now the minister of King
      Florestan at the Court of St. James’s. It was a wise appointment, for Sergius knew intimately
      all the English statesmen of eminence, and had known them for many years. They did not look
      upon him as the mere representative of a revolutionary and parvenu sovereign; he was quite one
      of themselves, had graduated at the Congress of Vienna, and, it was believed, had softened
      many subsequent difficulties by his sagacity. He had always been a cherished guest at Apsley
      House, and it was known the great duke often consulted him. “As long as Sergius sways his
      councils, He will indulge in no adventures,” said Europe. “As long as Sergius remains here,
      the English alliance is safe,” said England. After Europe and England, the most important
      confidence to obtain was that of Lord Hainault, and Baron Sergius had not been unsuccessful in
      that respect.</p>
     <p>“Your master has only to be liberal and steady,” said Lord Hainault, with his accustomed
      genial yet half-sarcastic smile, “and he may have anything he likes. But we do not want any
      wars; they are not liked in the City.”</p>
     <p>“Our policy is peace,” said Sergius.</p>
     <p>“I think we ought to congratulate Sir Peter,” said Mr. Waldershare to Adriana, with whom he
      had been dancing, and whom he was leading back to Lady Hainault. “Sir Peter, here is a lady
      who wishes to congratulate you on your deserved elevation.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I do not know what to say about it,” said the former Mr. Vigo, highly gratified, but
      a little confused; “my friends would have it.”</p>
     <p>“Ay, ay,” said Waldershare, “‘at the request of friends;’ the excuse I gave for publishing
      my sonnets.” And then, advancing, he delivered his charge to her <hi>chaperon</hi>, who looked
      dreamy, abstracted, and uninterested.</p>
     <p>“We have just been congratulating the new baronet, Sir Peter Vigo,” said Waldershare.</p>
     <p>“Ah!” said Lady Hainault with a contemptuous sigh, “he is, at any rate, not obliged to
      change his name. The desire to change one’s name does indeed appear to me to be a singular
      folly. If your name had been disgraced, I could understand it, as I could understand a man
      then going about in a mask. But the odd thing is, the persons who always want to change their
      names are those whose names are the most honoured.”</p>
     <p>“Oh, you are here!” said Mr. St. Barbe acidly to Mr. Seymour Hicks. “I think you are
      everywhere. I suppose they will make you a baronet next. Have you seen the batch? I could not
      believe my eyes when I read it. I believe the government is demented. Not a single literary
      man among them. Not that I wanted their baronetcy. Nothing would have tempted me to accept
      one. But there is Gushy; he, I know, would have liked it. I must say I feel for Gushy; his
      works only selling half what they did, and then thrown over in this insolent manner!”</p>
     <p>“Gushy is not in society,” said Mr. Seymour Hicks in a solemn tone of contemptuous pity.</p>
     <p>“That is society,” said St. Barbe, as he received a bow of haughty grace from Mrs. Rodney,
      who, fascinating and fascinated, was listening to the enamoured murmurs of an individual with
      a very bright star and a very red ribbon.</p>
     <p>“I dined with the Rodneys yesterday,” said Mr. Seymour Hicks; “they do the thing well.”</p>
     <p>“You dined there!” exclaimed St. Barbe. “It is very odd, they have never asked me. Not that
      I would have accepted their invitation. I avoid parvenus. They are too fidgety for my taste. I
      require repose, and only dine with the old nobility.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
     <p>The Right Honourable Job Thornberry and Mrs. Thornberry had received an invitation to the
      Montfort ball. Job took up the card, and turned it over more than once, and looked at it as if
      it were some strange animal, with an air of pleased and yet cynical perplexity; then he
      shrugged his shoulders and murmured to himself, “No, I don’t think that will do. Besides, I
      must be at Hurstley by that time.”</p>
     <p>Going to Hurstley now was not so formidable an affair as it was in Endymion’s boyhood. Then
      the journey occupied a whole and wearisome day. Little Hurstley had become a busy station of
      the great Slap-Bang railway, and a despatch train landed you at the bustling and flourishing
      hostelry, our old and humble friend, the Horse Shoe, within the two hours. It was a rate that
      satisfied even Thornberry, and almost reconciled him to the too frequent presence of his wife
      and family at Hurstley, a place to which Mrs. Thornberry had, it would seem, become
      passionately attached.</p>
     <p>“There is a charm about the place, I must say,” said Job to himself, as he reached his
      picturesque home on a rich summer evening; “and yet I hated it as a boy. To be sure, I was
      then discontented and unhappy, and now I have every reason to be much the reverse. Our
      feelings affect even scenery. It certainly is a pretty place; I really think one of the
      prettiest places in England.”</p>
     <p>Job was cordially welcomed. His wife embraced him, and the younger children clung to him
      with an affection which was not diminished by the remembrance that their father never visited
      them with empty hands. His eldest son, a good-looking and well-grown stripling, just home for
      the holidays, stood apart, determined to show he was a man of the world, and superior to the
      weakness of domestic sensibility. When the hubbub was a little over, he advanced and shook
      hands with his father with a certain dignity.</p>
     <p>“And when did you arrive, my boy? I was looking up your train in Bradshaw as I came along. I
      made out you should get the branch at Culvers Gate.”</p>
     <p>“I drove over,” replied the son; “I and a friend of mine drove tandem, and I’ll bet we got
      here sooner than we should have done by the branch.”</p>
     <p>“Hem!” said Job Thornberry.</p>
     <p>“Job,” said Mrs. Thornberry, “I have made two engagements for you this evening. First, we
      will go and see your father, and then we are to drink tea at the rectory.”</p>
     <p>“Hem!” said Job Thornberry; “well, I would rather the first evening should have been a quiet
      one; but let it be so.”</p>
     <p>The visit to the father was kind, dutiful, and wearisome. There was not a single subject on
      which the father and son had thoughts in common. The conversation of the father took various
      forms of expressing his wonder that his son had become what he was, and the son could only
      smile, and turn the subject, by asking after the produce of some particular field that had
      been prolific or obstinate in the old days. Mrs. Thornberry looked absent, and was thinking of
      the rectory; the grandson who had accompanied them was silent and supercilious; and everybody
      felt relieved when Mrs. Thornberry, veiling her impatience by her fear of keeping her
      father-in-law up late, made a determined move and concluded the domestic ceremony.</p>
     <p>The rectory afforded a lively contrast to the late scene. Mr. and Mrs. Penruddock were full
      of intelligence and animation. Their welcome of Mr. Thornberry was exactly what it ought to
      have been; respectful, even somewhat deferential, but cordial and unaffected. They conversed
      on all subjects, public and private, and on both seemed equally well informed, for they not
      only read more than one newspaper, but Mrs. Penruddock had an extensive correspondence, the
      conduct of which was one of the chief pleasures and excitements of her life. Their
      tea-equipage, too, was a picture of abundance and refinement. Such pretty china, and such
      various and delicious cakes! White bread, and brown bread, and plum cakes, and seed cakes, and
      no end of cracknels, and toasts, dry or buttered. Mrs. Thornberry seemed enchanted and gushing
      with affection,—everybody was dear or dearest. Even the face of John Hampden beamed with
      condescending delight as he devoured a pyramid of dainties.</p>
     <p>Just before the tea-equipage was introduced Mrs. Penruddock rose from her seat and whispered
      something to Mrs. Thornberry, who seemed pleased and agitated and a little blushing, and then
      their hostess addressed Job and said, “I was mentioning to your wife that the archbishop was
      here, and that I hope you would not dislike meeting him.”</p>
     <p>And very shortly after this, the archbishop, who had been taking a village walk, entered the
      room. It was evident that he was intimate with the occupiers of Hurstley Hall. He addressed
      Mrs. Thornberry with the ease of habitual acquaintance, while John Hampden seemed almost to
      rush into his arms. Job himself had seen his Grace in London, though he had never had the
      opportunity of speaking to him, but yielded to his cordiality, when the archbishop, on his
      being named, said, “It is a pleasure to meet an old friend, and in times past a kind one.”</p>
     <p>It was a most agreeable evening. The archbishop talked to every one, but never seemed to
      engross the conversation. He talked to the ladies of gardens, and cottages, and a little of
      books, seemed deeply interested in the studies and progress of the grandson Thornberry, who
      evidently idolised him; and in due course his Grace was engaged in economical speculations
      with Job himself, who was quite pleased to find a priest as liberal and enlightened as he was
      able and thoroughly informed. An hour before midnight they separated, though the archbishop
      attended them to the hall.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Thornberry’s birthday was near at hand, which Job always commemorated with a gift. It
      had commenced with some severe offering, like “Paradise Lost,” then it fell into the gentler
      form of Tennyson, and, of late, unconsciously under the influence of his wife, it had taken
      the shape of a bracelet or a shawl.</p>
     <p>This evening, as he was rather feeling his way as to what might please her most, Mrs.
      Thornberry embracing him, and hiding her face on his breast, murmured, “Do not give me any
      jewel, dear Job. What I should like would be that you should restore the chapel here.”</p>
     <p>“Restore the chapel here! oh, oh!” said Job Thornberry.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>
     <p>The archbishop called at Hurstley House the next day. It was a visit to Mr. Thornberry, but
      all the family were soon present, and clustered round the visitor. Then they walked together
      in the gardens, which had become radiant under the taste and unlimited expenditure of Mrs.
      Thornberry; beds glowing with colour or rivalling mosaics, choice conifers with their green or
      purple fruit, and rare roses with their fanciful and beauteous names; one, by the by, named
      “Mrs. Penruddock,” and a very gorgeous one, “The Archbishop.”</p>
     <p>As they swept along the terraces, restored to their pristine comeliness, and down the green
      avenues bounded by copper beeches and ancient yews, where men were sweeping away every leaf
      and twig that had fallen in the night and marred the consummate order, it must have been
      difficult for the Archbishop of Tyre not to recall the days gone by, when this brilliant and
      finished scene, then desolate and neglected, the abode of beauty and genius, yet almost of
      penury, had been to him a world of deep and familiar interest. Yes, he was walking in the same
      glade where he had once pleaded his own cause with an eloquence which none of his most
      celebrated sermons had excelled. Did he think of this? If he did, it was only to wrench the
      thought from his memory. Archbishops who are yet young, who are resolved to be cardinals, and
      who may be popes, are superior to all human weakness.</p>
     <p>“I should like to look at your chapel,” said his Grace to Mr. Thornberry; “I remember it a
      lumber room, and used to mourn over its desecration.”</p>
     <p>“I never was in it,” said Job, “and cannot understand why my wife is so anxious about it as
      she seems to be. When we first went to London, she always sate under the Reverend Socinus
      Frost, and seemed very satisfied. I have heard him; a sensible man—but sermons are not much in
      my way, and I do not belong to his sect, or indeed any other.”</p>
     <p>However, they went to the chapel all the same, for Mrs. Thornberry was resolved on the
      visit. It was a small chamber but beautifully proportioned, like the mansion itself—of a
      blended Italian and Gothic style. The roof was flat, but had been richly gilt and painted, and
      was sustained by corbels of angels, divinely carved. There had been some pews in the building;
      some had fallen to pieces, and some remained, but these were not in the original design. The
      sacred table had disappeared, but two saintly statues, sculptured in black oak, seemed still
      to guard the spot which it had consecrated.</p>
     <p>“I wonder what became of the communion table?” said Job.</p>
     <p>“Oh! my dear father, do not call it a communion table,” exclaimed John Hampden
      pettishly.</p>
     <p>“Why, what should I call it, my boy?”</p>
     <p>“The altar.”</p>
     <p>“Why, what does it signify what we call it? The thing is the same.”</p>
     <p>“Ah!” exclaimed the young gentleman, in a tone of contemptuous enthusiasm, “it is all the
      difference in the world. There should be a stone altar and a reredos. We have put up a reredos
      in our chapel at Bradley. All the fellows subscribed; I gave a sovereign.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I must say,” said the archbishop, who had been standing in advance with Mrs.
      Thornberry and the children, while this brief and becoming conversation was taking place
      between father and son, “I think you could hardly do a better thing than restore this chapel,
      Mr. Thornberry, but there must be no mistake about it. It must be restored to the letter, and
      it is a style that is not commonly understood. I have a friend, however, who is a master of
      it, the most rising man in his profession, as far as church architecture is concerned, and I
      will get him just to run down and look at this, and if, as I hope, you resolve to restore it,
      rest assured he will do you justice, and you will be proud of your place of worship.”</p>
     <p>“I do not care how much we spend on our gardens,” said Job, “for they are transitory
      pleasures, and we enjoy what we produce; but why I should restore a chapel in a house which
      does not belong to myself is not so clear to me.”</p>
     <p>“But it should belong to yourself,” rejoined the archbishop. “Hurstley is not in the market,
      but it is to be purchased. Take it altogether, I have always thought it one of the most
      enviable possessions in the world. The house, when put in order, would be one of the ornaments
      of the kingdom. The acreage, though considerable, is not overwhelming, and there is a range of
      wild country of endless charm. I wandered about it in my childhood and my youth, and I have
      never known anything equal to it. Then as to the soil and all that, you know it. You are a son
      of the soil. You left it for great objects, and you have attained those objects. They have
      given you fame as well as fortune. There would be something wonderfully dignified and graceful
      in returning to the land after you have taken the principal part in solving the difficulties
      which pertained to it, and emancipating it from many perils.”</p>
     <p>“I am sure it would be the happiest day of my life, if Job would purchase Hurstley,” said
      Mrs. Thornberry.</p>
     <p>“I should like to go to Oxford, and my father purchase Hurstley,” said the young gentleman.
      “If we have not landed property, I would sooner have none. If we have not land, I should like
      to go into the Church, and if I may not go to Oxford, I would go to Cuddesdon at once. I know
      it can be done, for I know a fellow who has done it.”</p>
     <p>Poor Job Thornberry! He had ruled multitudes, and had conquered and commanded senates. His
      Sovereign had made him one of her privy councillors, and half a million of people had returned
      him their representative to parliament. And here he stood silent, and a little confused;
      sapped by his wife, bullied by his son, and after having passed a great part of his life in
      denouncing sacerdotalism, finding his whole future career chalked out, without himself being
      consulted, by a priest who was so polite, sensible, and so truly friendly, that his manner
      seemed to deprive its victims of every faculty of retort or repartee. Still he was going to
      say something when the door opened, and Mrs. Penruddock appeared, exclaiming in a cheerful
      voice, “I thought I should find you here. I would not have troubled your Grace, but this
      letter marked ‘private, immediate, and to be forwarded,’ has been wandering about for some
      time, and I thought it was better to bring it to you at once.”</p>
     <p>The Archbishop of Tyre took the letter, and seemed to start as he read the direction. Then
      he stood aside, opened it, and read its contents. The letter was from Lady Roehampton,
      desiring to see him as soon as possible on a matter of the utmost gravity, and entreating him
      not to delay his departure, wherever he might be.</p>
     <p>“I am sorry to quit you all,” said his Grace; “but I must go up to town immediately. The
      business is urgent.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
     <p>Endymion arrived at home very late from the Montfort ball, and rose in consequence at an
      unusually late hour. He had taken means to become sufficiently acquainted with the cause of
      his sister’s absence the night before, so he had no anxiety on that head. Lady Roehampton had
      really intended to have been present, was indeed dressed for the occasion; but when the moment
      of trial arrived, she was absolutely unequal to the effort. All this was amplified in a little
      note from his sister, which his valet brought him in the morning. What, however, considerably
      surprised him in this communication was her announcement that her feelings last night had
      proved to her that she ought not to remain in London, and that she intended to find solitude
      and repose in the little watering-place where she had passed a tranquil autumn during the
      first year of her widowhood. What completed his astonishment, however, was the closing
      intimation that, in all probability, she would have left town before he rose. The moment she
      had got a little settled she would write to him, and when business permitted, he must come and
      pay her a little visit.</p>
     <p>“She was always capricious,” exclaimed Lady Montfort, who had not forgotten the disturbance
      of her royal supper-table.</p>
     <p>“Hardly that, I think,” said Endymion. “I have always looked on Myra as a singularly
      consistent character.”</p>
     <p>“I know, you never admit your sister has a fault.”</p>
     <p>“You said the other day yourself that she was the only perfect character you knew.”</p>
     <p>“Did I say that? I think her capricious.”</p>
     <p>“I do not think you are capricious,” said Endymion, “and yet the world sometimes says you
      are.”</p>
     <p>“I change my opinion of persons when my taste is offended,” said Lady Montfort. “What I
      admired in your sister, though I confess I sometimes wished not to admire her, was that she
      never offended my taste.”</p>
     <p>“I hope satisfied it,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Yes, satisfied it, always satisfied it. I wonder what will be her lot, for, considering her
      youth, her destiny has hardly begun. Somehow or other, I do not think she will marry Sidney
      Wilton.”</p>
     <p>“I have sometimes thought that would be,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Well, it would be, I think, a happy match. All the circumstances would be collected that
      form what is supposed to be happiness. But tastes differ about destinies as well as about
      manners. For my part, I think to have a husband who loved you, and he clever, accomplished,
      charming, ambitious, would be happiness; but I doubt whether your sister cares so much about
      these things. She may, of course does, talk to you more freely; but with others, in her most
      open hours, there seems a secret fund of reserve in her character which I never could
      penetrate, except, I think, it is a reserve which does not originate in a love of
      tranquillity, but quite the reverse. She is a strong character.”</p>
     <p>“Then, hardly a capricious one.”</p>
     <p>“No, not capricious; I only said that to tease you. I am capricious; I know it. I disregard
      people sometimes that I have patronised and flattered. It is not merely that I have changed my
      opinion of them, but I positively hate them.”</p>
     <p>“I hope you will never hate me,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“You have never offended my taste yet,” said Lady Montfort with a smile.</p>
     <p>Endymion was engaged to dine to-day with Mr. Bertie Tremaine. Although now in hostile
      political camps, that great leader of men never permitted their acquaintance to cease. “He is
      young,” reasoned Mr. Bertie Tremaine; “every political party changes its principles on an
      average once in ten years. Those who are young must often then form new connections, and
      Ferrars will then come to me. He will be ripe and experienced, and I could give him a good
      deal. I do not want numbers. I want men. In opposition, numbers often only embarrass. The
      power of the future is ministerial capacity. The leader with a cabinet formed will be the
      minister of England. He is not to trouble himself about numbers; that is an affair of the
      constituencies.”</p>
     <p>Male dinners are in general not amusing. When they are formed, as they usually are, of men
      who are supposed to possess a strong and common sympathy—political, sporting, literary,
      military, social—there is necessarily a monotony of thought and feeling, and of the materials
      which induce thought and feeling. In a male dinner of party politicians, conversation soon
      degenerates into what is termed “shop;” anecdotes about divisions, criticism of speeches,
      conjectures about office, speculations on impending elections, and above all, that heinous
      subject on which enormous fibs are ever told, the registration. There are, however, occasional
      glimpses in their talk which would seem to intimate that they have another life outside the
      Houses of Parliament. But that extenuating circumstance does not apply to the sporting dinner.
      There they begin with odds and handicaps, and end with handicaps and odds, and it is doubtful
      whether it ever occurs to any one present, that there is any other existing combination of
      atoms than odds and handicaps. A dinner of wits is proverbially a place of silence; and the
      envy and hatred which all literary men really feel for each other, especially when they are
      exchanging dedications of mutual affection, always ensure, in such assemblies, the agreeable
      presence of a general feeling of painful constraint. If a good thing occurs to a guest, he
      will not express it, lest his neighbour, who is publishing a novel in numbers, shall
      appropriate it next month, or he himself, who has the same responsibility of production, be
      deprived of its legitimate appearance. Those who desire to learn something of the manoeuvres
      at the Russian and Prussian reviews, or the last rumour at Aldershot or the military clubs,
      will know where to find this feast of reason. The flow of soul in these male festivals is
      perhaps, on the whole, more genial when found in a society of young gentlemen, graduates of
      the Turf and the Marlborough, and guided in their benignant studies by the gentle experience
      and the mild wisdom of White’s. The startling scandal, the rattling anecdote, the astounding
      leaps, and the amazing shots, afford for the moment a somewhat pleasing distraction, but when
      it is discovered that all these habitual flim-flams are, in general, the airy creatures of
      inaccuracy and exaggeration—that the scandal is not true, the anecdote has no foundation, and
      that the feats and skill and strength are invested with the organic weakness of tradition, the
      vagaries lose something of the charm of novelty, and are almost as insipid as claret from
      which the bouquet has evaporated.</p>
     <p>The male dinners of Mr. Bertie Tremaine were an exception to the general reputation of such
      meetings. They were never dull. In the first place, though to be known at least by reputation
      was an indispensable condition of being present, he brought different classes together, and
      this, at least for once, stimulates and gratifies curiosity. His house too was open to
      foreigners of celebrity, without reference to their political parties or opinions. Every one
      was welcome except absolute assassins. The host too had studied the art of developing
      character and conversation, and if sometimes he was not so successful in this respect as he
      deserved, there was no lack of amusing entertainment, for in these social encounters Mr.
      Bertie Tremaine was a reserve in himself, and if nobody else would talk, he would avail
      himself of the opportunity of pouring forth the treasures of his own teeming intelligence. His
      various knowledge, his power of speech, his eccentric paradoxes, his pompous rhetoric,
      relieved by some happy sarcasm, and the obvious sense, in all he said and did, of innate
      superiority to all his guests, made these exhibitions extremely amusing.</p>
     <p>“What Bertie Tremaine will end in,” Endymion would sometimes say, “perplexes me. Had there
      been no revolution in 1832, and he had entered parliament for his family borough, I think he
      must by this time have been a minister. Such tenacity of purpose could scarcely fail. But he
      has had to say and do so many odd things, first to get into parliament, and secondly to keep
      there, that his future now is not so clear. When I first knew him, he was a Benthamite; at
      present, I sometimes seem to foresee that he will end by being the leader of the
      Protectionists and the Protestants.”</p>
     <p>“And a good strong party too,” said Trenchard, “but query whether strong enough?”</p>
     <p>“That is exactly what Bertie Tremaine is trying to find out.”</p>
     <p>Mr. Bertie Tremaine’s manner in receiving his guests was courtly and ceremonious; a contrast
      to the free and easy style of the time. But it was adopted after due reflection. “No man can
      tell you what will be the position he may be called upon to fill. But he has a right to assume
      he will always be ascending. I, for example, may be destined to be the president of a
      republic, the regent of a monarchy, or a sovereign myself. It would be painful and
      disagreeable to have to change one’s manner at a perhaps advanced period of life, and become
      liable to the unpopular imputation that you had grown arrogant and overbearing. On the
      contrary, in my case, whatever my elevation, there will be no change. My brother, Mr. Tremaine
      Bertie, acts on a different principle. He is a Sybarite, and has a general contempt for
      mankind, certainly for the mob and the middle class, but he is ‘Hail fellow, well met!’ with
      them all. He says it answers at elections; I doubt it. I myself represent a popular
      constituency, but I believe I owe my success in no slight measure to the manner in which I
      gave my hand when I permitted it to be touched. As I say sometimes to Mr. Tremaine Bertie,
      ‘You will find this habit of social familiarity embarrassing when I send you to St. Petersburg
      or Vienna.’”</p>
     <p>Waldershare dined there, now a peer, though, as he rejoiced to say, not a peer of
      parliament. An Irish peer, with an English constituency, filled, according to Waldershare, the
      most enviable of positions. His rank gave him social influence, and his seat in the House of
      Commons that power which all aspire to obtain. The cynosure of the banquet, however, was a
      gentleman who had, about a year before, been the president of a republic for nearly six weeks,
      and who being master of a species of rhapsodical rhetoric, highly useful in troubled times,
      when there is no real business to transact, and where there is nobody to transact it, had
      disappeared when the treasury was quite empty, and there were no further funds to reward the
      enthusiastic citizens who had hitherto patriotically maintained order at wages about double in
      amount to what they had previously received in their handicrafts. This great reputation had
      been brought over by Mr. Tremaine Bertie, now introducing him into English political society.
      Mr. Tremaine Bertie hung upon the accents of the oracle, every word of which was intended to
      be picturesque or profound, and then surveyed his friends with a glance of appreciating
      wonder. Sensible Englishmen, like Endymion and Trenchard, looked upon the whole exhibition as
      fustian, and received the revelations with a smile of frigid courtesy.</p>
     <p>The presence, however, of this celebrity of six weeks gave occasionally a tone of foreign
      politics to the conversation, and the association of ideas, which, in due course, rules all
      talk, brought them, among other incidents and instances, to the remarkable career of King
      Florestan.</p>
     <p>“And yet he has his mortifications,” said a sensible man. “He wants a wife, and the
      princesses of the world will not furnish him with one.”</p>
     <p>“What authority have you for saying so?” exclaimed the fiery Waldershare. “The princesses of
      the world would be great fools if they refused such a man, but I know of no authentic instance
      of such denial.”</p>
     <p>“Well, it is the common rumour.”</p>
     <p>“And, therefore, probably a common falsehood.”</p>
     <p>“Were he wise,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine, “King Florestan would not marry. Dynasties are
      unpopular; especially new ones. The present age is monarchical, but not dynastic. The king,
      who is a man of reach, and who has been pondering such circumstances all his life, is probably
      well aware of this, and will not be such a fool as to marry.”</p>
     <p>“How is the monarchy to go on, if there is to be no successor?” inquired Trenchard. “You
      would not renew the Polish constitution?”</p>
     <p>“The Polish constitution, by the by, was not so bad a thing,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine.
      “Under it a distinguished Englishman might have mixed with the crowned heads of Europe, as Sir
      Philip Sidney nearly did. But I was looking to something superior to the Polish constitution,
      or perhaps any other; I was contemplating a monarchy with the principle of adoption. That
      would give you all the excellence of the Polish constitution, and the order and constancy in
      which it failed. It would realise the want of the age; monarchical, not dynastical,
      institutions, and it would act independent of the passions and intrigues of the multitude. The
      principle of adoption was the secret of the strength and endurance of Rome. It gave Rome alike
      the Scipios and the Antonines.”</p>
     <p>“A court would be rather dull without a woman at its head.”</p>
     <p>“On the contrary,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine. “It was Louis Quatorze who made the court; not
      his queen.”</p>
     <p>“Well,” said Waldershare, “all the same, I fear King Florestan will adopt no one in this
      room, though he has several friends here, and I am one; and I believe that he will marry, and
      I cannot help fancying that the partner of this throne will not be as insignificant as Louis
      the Fourteenth’s wife, or Catherine of Braganza.”</p>
     <p>Jawett dined this day with Mr. Bertie Tremaine. He was a frequent guest there, and still was
      the editor of the “Precursor,” though it sometimes baffled all that lucidity of style for
      which he was celebrated to reconcile the conduct of the party, of which the “Precursor” was
      alike the oracle and organ, with the opinions with which that now well-established journal
      first attempted to direct and illuminate the public mind. It seemed to the editor that the
      “Precursor” dwelt more on the past than became a harbinger of the future. Not that Mr. Bertie
      Tremaine ever for a moment admitted that there was any difficulty in any case. He never
      permitted any dogmas that he had ever enunciated to be surrendered, however contrary at their
      first aspect.</p>
     <p>“All are but parts of one stupendous whole,”</p>
     <p>and few things were more interesting than the conference in which Mr. Bertie Tremaine had to
      impart his views and instructions to the master of that lucid style, which had the merit of
      making everything so very clear when the master himself was, as at present, extremely
      perplexed and confused. Jawett lingered after the other guests, that he might have the
      advantage of consulting the great leader on the course which he ought to take in advocating a
      measure which seemed completely at variance with all the principles they had ever upheld.</p>
     <p>“I do not see your difficulty,” wound up the host. “Your case is clear. You have a principle
      which will carry you through everything. That is the charm of a principle. You have always an
      answer ready.”</p>
     <p>“But in this case,” somewhat timidly inquired Mr. Jawett, “what would be the principle on
      which I should rest?”</p>
     <p>“You must show,” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine, “that democracy is aristocracy in disguise; and
      that aristocracy is democracy in disguise. It will carry you through everything.”</p>
     <p>Even Jawett looked a little amazed.</p>
     <p>“But”—he was beginning, when Mr. Bertie Tremaine arose. “Think of what I have said, and if
      on reflection any doubt or difficulty remain in your mind, call on me to-morrow before I go to
      the House. At present, I must pay my respects to Lady Beaumaris. She is the only woman the
      Tories can boast of; but she is a first-rate woman, and is a power which I must secure.”</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXIV</head>
     <p>A month had nearly elapsed since the Montfort ball; the season was over and the session was
      nearly finished. The pressure of parliamentary life for those in office is extreme during this
      last month, yet Endymion would have contrived, were it only for a day, to have visited his
      sister, had Lady Roehampton much encouraged his appearance. Strange as it seemed to him, she
      did not, but, on the contrary, always assumed that the prorogation of parliament would alone
      bring them together again. When he proposed on one occasion to come down for four-and-twenty
      hours, she absolutely, though with much affection, adjourned the fulfilment of the offer. It
      seemed that she was not yet quite settled.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort lingered in London even after Goodwood. She was rather embarrassed, as she
      told Endymion, about her future plans. Lord Montfort was at Princedown, where she wished to
      join him, but he did not respond to her wishes; on the contrary, while announcing that he was
      indisposed, and meant to remain at Princedown for the summer, he suggested that she should
      avail herself of the opportunity, and pay a long visit to her family in the north. “I know
      what he means,” she observed; “he wants the world to believe that we are separated. He cannot
      repudiate me—he is too great a gentleman to do anything coarsely unjust; but he thinks, by
      tact and indirect means, he may achieve our virtual separation. He has had this purpose for
      years, I believe now ever since our marriage, but hitherto I have baffled him. I ought to be
      with him; I really believe he is indisposed, his face has become so pale of late; but were I
      to persist in going to Princedown I should only drive him away. He would go off into the night
      without leaving his address, and something would happen—dreadful or absurd. What I had best
      do, I think, is this. You are going at last to pay your visit to your sister; I will write to
      my lord and tell him that as he does not wish me to go to Princedown, I propose to go to
      Montfort Castle. When the flag is flying at Montfort, I can pay a visit of any length to my
      family. It will only be a neighbouring visit from Montfort to them; perhaps, too, they might
      return it. At any rate, then they cannot say my lord and I are separated. We need not live
      under the same roof, but so long as I live under his roof the world considers us united. It is
      a pity to have to scheme in this manner, and rather degrading, particularly when one might be
      so happy with him. But you know, my dear Endymion, all about our affairs. Your friend is not a
      very happy woman, and if not a very unhappy one, it is owing much to your dear friendship, and
      a little to my own spirit which keeps me up under what is frequent and sometimes bitter
      mortification. And now adieu! I suppose you cannot be away less than a week. Probably on your
      return you will find me here. I cannot go to Montfort without his permission. But he will give
      it. I observe that he will always do anything to gain his immediate object. His immediate
      object is, that I shall not go to Princedown, and so he will agree that I shall go to
      Montfort.”</p>
     <p>For the first time in his life, Endymion felt some constraint in the presence of Myra. There
      was something changed in her manner. No diminution of affection, for she threw her arms around
      him and pressed him to her heart; and then she looked at him anxiously, even sadly, and kissed
      both his eyes, and then she remained for some moments in silence with her face hid on his
      shoulder. Never since the loss of Lord Roehampton had she seemed so subdued.</p>
     <p>“It is a long separation,” she at length said, with a voice and smile equally faint, “and
      you must be a little wearied with your travelling. Come and refresh yourself, and then I will
      show you my boudoir I have made here; rather pretty, out of nothing. And then we will sit down
      and have a long talk together, for I have much to tell you, and I want your advice.”</p>
     <p>“She is going to marry Sidney Wilton,” thought Endymion; “that is clear.”</p>
     <p>The boudoir was really pretty, “made out of nothing;” a gay chintz, some shelves of
      beautiful books, some fanciful chairs, and a portrait of Lord Roehampton.</p>
     <p>It was a long interview, very long, and if one could judge by the countenance of Endymion,
      when he quitted the boudoir and hastened to his room, of grave import. Sometimes his face was
      pale, sometimes scarlet; the changes were rapid, but the expression was agitated rather than
      one of gratification.</p>
     <p>He sent instantly for his servant, and then penned this telegram to Lady Montfort: “My visit
      here will be short. I am to see you immediately. Nothing must prevent your being at home when
      I call to-morrow, about four o’clock. Most, most important.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
     <p>“Well, something has happened at last,” said Lady Montfort with a wondering countenance; “it
      is too marvellous.”</p>
     <p>“She goes to Osborne to-day,” continued Endymion, “and I suppose after that, in due course,
      it will be generally known. I should think the formal announcement would be made abroad. It
      has been kept wonderfully close. She wished you to know it first, at least from her. I do not
      think she ever hesitated about accepting him. There was delay from various causes; whether
      there should be a marriage by proxy first in this country, and other points; about religion,
      for example.”</p>
     <p>“Well?”</p>
     <p>“She enters the Catholic Church, the Archbishop of Tyre has received her. There is no
      difficulty and no great ceremonies in such matters. She was re-baptized, but only by way of
      precaution. It was not necessary, for our baptism, you know, is recognised by Rome.”</p>
     <p>“And that was all!”</p>
     <p>“All, with a first communion and confession. It is all consummated now; as you say, ‘It is
      too wonderful.’ A first confession, and to Nigel Penruddock, who says life is flat and
      insipid!”</p>
     <p>“I shall write to her: I must write to her. I wonder if I shall see her before she
      departs.”</p>
     <p>“That is certain if you wish it; she wishes it.”</p>
     <p>“And when does she go? And who goes with her?”</p>
     <p>“She will be under my charge,” said Endymion. “It is fortunate that it should happen at a
      time when I am free. I am personally to deliver her to the king. The Duke of St. Angelo, Baron
      Sergius, and the archbishop accompany her, and Waldershare, at the particular request of his
      Majesty.”</p>
     <p>“And no lady?”</p>
     <p>“She takes Adriana with her.”</p>
     <p>“Adriana!” repeated Lady Montfort, and a cloud passed over her brow. There was a momentary
      pause, and then Lady Montfort said, “I wish she would take me.”</p>
     <p>“That would be delightful,” said Endymion, “and most becoming—to have for a companion the
      greatest lady of our court.”</p>
     <p>“She will not take me with her,” said Lady Montfort, sorrowfully but decisively, and shaking
      her head. “Dear woman! I loved her always, often most when I seemed least affectionate—but
      there was between us something”—and she hesitated. “Heigho! I may be the greatest lady of our
      court, but I am a very unhappy woman, Endymion, and what annoys and dispirits me most,
      sometimes quite breaks me down, is that I cannot see that I deserve my lot.”</p>
     <p>It happened as Endymion foresaw; the first announcement came from abroad. King Florestan
      suddenly sent a message to his parliament, that his Majesty was about to present them with a
      queen. She was not the daughter of a reigning house, but she came from the land of freedom and
      political wisdom, and from the purest and most powerful court in Europe. His subjects soon
      learnt that she was the most beautiful of women, for the portrait of the Countess of
      Roehampton, as it were by magic, seemed suddenly to fill every window in every shop in the
      teeming and brilliant capital where she was about to reign.</p>
     <p>It was convenient that these great events should occur when everybody was out of town. Lady
      Montfort alone remained, the frequent, if not constant, companion of the new sovereign.
      Berengaria soon recovered her high spirits. There was much to do and prepare in which her
      hints and advice were invaluable. Though she was not to have the honour of attending Myra to
      her new home, which, considering her high place in the English court, was perhaps hardly
      consistent with etiquette, for so she now cleverly put it, she was to pay her Majesty a visit
      in due time. The momentary despondency that had clouded her brilliant countenance had not only
      disappeared, but she had quite forgotten, and certainly would not admit, that she was anything
      but the most sanguine and energetic of beings, and rallied Endymion unmercifully for his
      careworn countenance and too frequent air of depression. The truth is, the great change that
      was impending was one which might well make him serious, and sometimes sad.</p>
     <p>The withdrawal of a female influence, so potent on his life as that of his sister, was
      itself a great event. There had been between them from the cradle, which, it may be said, they
      had shared, a strong and perfect sympathy. They had experienced together vast and strange
      vicissitudes of life. Though much separated in his early youth, there had still been a
      constant interchange of thought and feeling between them. For the last twelve years or so,
      ever since Myra had become acquainted with the Neuchatel family, they may be said never to
      have separated—at least they had maintained a constant communication, and generally a personal
      one. She had in a great degree moulded his life. Her unfaltering, though often unseen,
      influence had created his advancement. Her will was more powerful than his. He was more
      prudent and plastic. He felt this keenly. He was conscious that, left to himself, he would
      probably have achieved much less. He remembered her words when they parted for the first time
      at Hurstley, “Women will be your best friends in life.” And that brought his thoughts to the
      only subject on which they had ever differed—her wished-for union between himself and Adriana.
      He felt he had crossed her there—that he had prevented the fulfilment of her deeply-matured
      plans. Perhaps, had that marriage taken place, she would never have quitted England. Perhaps;
      but was that desirable? Was it not fitter that so lofty a spirit should find a seat as exalted
      as her capacity? Myra was a sovereign! In this age of strange events, not the least strange.
      No petty cares and griefs must obtrude themselves in such majestic associations. And yet the
      days at Hainault were very happy, and the bright visits to Gaydene, and her own pleasant
      though stately home. His heart was agitated, and his eyes were often moistened with emotion.
      He seemed to think that all the thrones of Christendom could be no compensation for the loss
      of this beloved genius of his life, whom he might never see again. Sometimes, when he paid his
      daily visit to Berengaria, she who knew him by heart, who studied every expression of his
      countenance and every tone of his voice, would say to him, after a few minutes of desultory
      and feeble conversation, “You are thinking of your sister, Endymion?”</p>
     <p>He did not reply, but gave a sort of faint mournful smile.</p>
     <p>“This separation is a trial, a severe one, and I knew you would feel it,” said Lady
      Montfort. “I feel it; I loved your sister, but she did not love me. Nobody that I love ever
      does love me.”</p>
     <p>“Oh! do not say that, Lady Montfort.”</p>
     <p>“It is what I feel. I cannot console you. There is nothing I can do for you. My friendship,
      if you value it, which I will not doubt you do, you fully possessed before your sister was a
      Queen. So that goes for nothing.”</p>
     <p>“I must say, I feel sometimes most miserable.”</p>
     <p>“Nonsense, Endymion; if anything could annoy your sister more than another, it would be to
      hear of such feelings on your part. I must say she has courage. She has found her fitting
      place. Her brother ought to do the same. You have a great object in life, at least you had,
      but I have no faith in sentimentalists. If I had been sentimental, I should have gone into a
      convent long ago.”</p>
     <p>“If to feel is to be sentimental, I cannot help it.”</p>
     <p>“All feeling which has no object to attain is morbid and maudlin,” said Lady Montfort. “You
      say you are very miserable, and at the same time you do not know what you want. Would you have
      your sister dethroned? And if you would, could you accomplish your purpose? Well, then, what
      nonsense to think about her except to feel proud of her elevation, and prouder still that she
      is equal to it!”</p>
     <p>“You always have the best of every argument,” said Endymion.</p>
     <p>“Of course,” said Lady Montfort. “What I want you to do is to exert yourself. You have now a
      strong social position, for Sidney Wilton tells me the Queen has relinquished to you her
      mansion and the whole of her income, which is no mean one. You must collect your friends about
      you. Our government is not too strong, I can tell you. We must brush up in the recess. What
      with Mr. Bertie Tremaine and his friends joining the Protectionists, and the ultra-Radicals
      wanting, as they always do, something impossible, I see seeds of discomfiture unless they are
      met with energy. You stand high, and are well spoken of even by our opponents. Whether we
      stand or fall, it is a moment for you to increase your personal influence. That is the element
      now to encourage in your career, because you are not like the old fogies in the cabinet, who,
      if they go out, will never enter another again. You have a future, and though you may not be
      an emperor, you may be what I esteem more, prime minister of this country.”</p>
     <p>“You are always so sanguine.”</p>
     <p>“Not more sanguine than your sister. Often we have talked of this. I wish she were here to
      help us, but I will do my part. At present let us go to luncheon.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVI</head>
     <p>There was a splendid royal yacht, though not one belonging to our gracious Sovereign, lying
      in one of Her Majesty’s southern ports, and the yacht was convoyed by a smart frigate. The
      crews were much ashore, and were very popular, for they spent a great deal of money. Everybody
      knew what was the purpose of their bright craft, and every one was interested in it. A
      beautiful Englishwoman had been selected to fill a foreign and brilliant throne occupied by a
      prince, who had been educated in our own country, who ever avowed his sympathies with “the
      inviolate island of the sage and free.” So in fact there was some basis for the enthusiasm
      which was felt on this occasion by the inhabitants of Nethampton. What every one wanted to
      know was when she would sail. Ah! that was a secret that could hardly be kept for the
      eight-and-forty hours preceding her departure, and therefore, one day, with no formal notice,
      all the inhabitants of Nethampton were in gala; streets and ships dressed out with the flags
      of all nations; the church bells ringing; and busy little girls running about with huge
      bouquets.</p>
     <p>At the very instant expected, the special train was signalled, and drove into the crimson
      station amid the thunder of artillery, the blare of trumpets, the beating of drums, and cheers
      from thousands even louder and longer than the voices of the cannon. Leaning on the arm of her
      brother, and attended by the Princess of Montserrat, and the Honourable Adriana Neuchatel,
      Baron Sergius, the Duke of St. Angelo, the Archbishop of Tyre, and Lord Waldershare, the
      daughter of William Ferrars, gracious, yet looking as if she were born to empire, received the
      congratulatory address of the mayor and corporation and citizens of Nethampton, and permitted
      her hand to be kissed, not only by his worship, but by at least two aldermen.</p>
     <p>They were on the waters, and the shores of Albion, fast fading away, had diminished to a
      speck. It is a melancholy and tender moment, and Myra was in her ample and splendid cabin and
      alone. “It is a trial,” she felt, “but all that I love and value in this world are in this
      vessel,” and she thought of Endymion and Adriana. The gentlemen were on deck, chiefly smoking
      or reconnoitring their convoy through their telescopes.</p>
     <p>“I must say,” said Waldershare, “it was a grand idea of our kings making themselves
      sovereigns of the sea. The greater portion of this planet is water; so we at once became a
      first-rate power. We owe our navy entirely to the Stuarts. King James the Second was the true
      founder and hero of the British navy. He was the worthy son of his admirable father, that
      blessed martyr, the restorer at least, if not the inventor, of ship money; the most patriotic
      and popular tax that ever was devised by man. The Nonconformists thought themselves so wise in
      resisting it, and they have got the naval estimates instead!”</p>
     <p>The voyage was propitious, the weather delightful, and when they had entered the southern
      waters Waldershare confessed that he felt the deliciousness of life. If the scene and the
      impending events, and their own fair thoughts, had not been adequate to interest them, there
      were ample resources at their command; all the ladies were skilled musicians, their concerts
      commenced at sunset, and the sweetness of their voices long lingered over the moonlit
      waters.</p>
     <p>Adriana, one evening, bending over the bulwarks of the yacht, was watching the track of
      phosphoric light, struck into brilliancy from the dark blue waters by the prow of their rapid
      vessel. “It is a fascinating sight, Miss Neuchatel, and it seems one might gaze on it for
      ever.”</p>
     <p>“Ah! Lord Waldershare, you caught me in a reverie.”</p>
     <p>“What more sweet?”</p>
     <p>“Well, that depends on its subject. To tell the truth, I was thinking that these lights
      resembled a little your conversation; all the wondrous things you are always saying or telling
      us.”</p>
     <p>The archbishop was a man who never recurred to the past. One could never suppose that
      Endymion and himself had been companions in their early youth, or, so far as their intercourse
      was concerned, that there was such a place in the world as Hurstley. One night, however, as
      they were pacing the deck together, he took the arm of Endymion, and said, “I trace the hand
      of Providence in every incident of your sister’s life. What we deemed misfortunes, sorrows,
      even calamities, were forming a character originally endowed with supreme will, and destined
      for the highest purposes. There was a moment at Hurstley when I myself was crushed to the
      earth, and cared not to live; vain, short-sighted mortal! Our great Master was at that moment
      shaping everything to His ends, and preparing for the entrance into His Church of a woman who
      may be, who will be, I believe, another St. Helena.”</p>
     <p>“We have not spoken of this subject before,” said Endymion, “and I should not have cared had
      our silence continued, but I must now tell you frankly, the secession of my sister from the
      Church of her fathers was to me by no means a matter of unmixed satisfaction.”</p>
     <p>“The time will come when you will recognise it as the consummation of a Divine plan,” said
      the archbishop.</p>
     <p>“I feel great confidence that my sister will never be the slave of superstition,” said
      Endymion. “Her mind is too masculine for that; she will remember that the throne she fills has
      been already once lost by the fatal influence of the Jesuits.”</p>
     <p>“The influence of the Jesuits is the influence of Divine truth,” said his companion. “And
      how is it possible for such influence not to prevail? What you treat as defeats,
      discomfitures, are events which you do not comprehend. They are incidents all leading to one
      great end—the triumph of the Church—that is, the triumph of God.”</p>
     <p>“I will not decide what are great ends; I am content to ascertain what is wise conduct. And
      it would not be wise conduct, in my opinion, for the King to rest upon the Jesuits.”</p>
     <p>“The Jesuits never fell except from conspiracy against them. It is never the public voice
      that demands their expulsion or the public effort that accomplishes it. It is always the
      affair of sovereigns and statesmen, of politicians, of men, in short, who feel that there is a
      power at work, and that power one not favourable to their schemes or objects of
      government.”</p>
     <p>“Well, we shall see,” said Endymion; “I candidly tell you, I hope the Jesuits will have as
      little influence in my brother-in-law’s kingdom as in my own country.”</p>
     <p>“As little!” said Nigel, somewhat sarcastically; “I should be almost content if the holy
      order in every country had as much influence as they now have in England.”</p>
     <p>“I think your Grace exaggerates.”</p>
     <p>“Before two years are past,” said the archbishop, speaking very slowly, “I foresee that the
      Jesuits will be privileged in England, and the hierarchy of our Church recognised.”</p>
     <p>It was a delicious afternoon; it had been sultry, but the sun had now greatly declined, when
      the captain of the yacht came down to announce to the Queen that they were in sight of her new
      country, and she hastened on deck to behold the rapidly nearing shore. A squadron of ships of
      war had stood out to meet her, and in due time the towers and spires of a beautiful city
      appeared, which was the port of the capital, and itself almost worthy of being one. A royal
      barge, propelled by four-and-twenty rowers, and bearing the lord chamberlain, awaited the
      queen, and the moment her Majesty and the Princess of Montserrat had taken their seats,
      salutes thundered from every ship of war, responded to by fort and battery ashore.</p>
     <p>When they landed, they were conducted by chief officers of the court to a pavilion which
      faced the western sky, now glowing like an opal with every shade of the iris, and then
      becoming of a light green colour varied only by some slight clouds burnished with gold. A
      troop of maidens brought flowers as bright as themselves, and then a company of pages
      advanced, and kneeling, offered to the Queen chocolate in a crystal cup.</p>
     <p>According to the programme drawn up by the heralds, and every tittle of it founded on
      precedents, the King and the royal carriages were to have met the travellers on their arrival
      at the metropolis; but there are feelings which heralds do not comprehend, and which defy
      precedents. Suddenly there was a shout, a loud cheer, and a louder salute. Some one had
      arrived unexpectedly. A young man, stately but pale, moved through the swiftly receding crowd,
      alone and unattended, entered the pavilion, advanced to the Queen, kissed her hand, and then
      both her cheeks, just murmuring, “My best beloved, this, this indeed is joy.”</p>
     <p>The capital was fortified, and the station was without the walls; here the royal carriages
      awaited them. The crowd was immense; the ramparts on this occasion were covered with people.
      It was an almost sultry night, with every star visible, and clear and warm and sweet. As the
      royal carriage crossed the drawbridge and entered the chief gates, the whole city was in an
      instant suddenly illuminated—in a flash. The architectural lines of the city walls, and of
      every street, were indicated, and along the ramparts at not distant intervals were tripods,
      each crowned with a silver flame, which cast around the radiance of day.</p>
     <p>He held and pressed her hand as in silence she beheld the wondrous scene. They had to make a
      progress of some miles; the way was kept throughout by soldiery and civic guards, while beyond
      them was an infinite population, all cheering and many of them waving torches. They passed
      through many streets, and squares with marvellous fountains, until they arrived at the chief
      and royal street, which has no equal in the world. It is more than a mile long, never swerving
      from a straight line, broad, yet the houses so elevated that they generally furnish the shade
      this ardent clime requires. The architecture of this street is so varied that it never becomes
      monotonous, some beautiful church, or palace, or ministerial hotel perpetually varying the
      effect. All the windows were full on this occasion, and even the roofs were crowded. Every
      house was covered with tapestry, and the line of every building was marked out by artificial
      light. The moon rose, but she was not wanted; it was as light as day.</p>
     <p>They were considerate enough not to move too rapidly through this heart of the metropolis,
      and even halted at some stations, where bands of music and choirs of singers welcomed and
      celebrated them. They moved on more quickly afterwards, made their way through a pretty
      suburb, and then entered a park. At the termination of a long avenue was the illumined and
      beautiful palace of the Prince of Montserrat, where Myra was to reside and repose until the
      momentous morrow, when King Florestan was publicly to place on the brow of his affianced bride
      the crown which to his joy she had consented to share.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVII</head>
     <p>There are very few temperaments that can resist an universal and unceasing festival in a
      vast and beautiful metropolis. It is inebriating, and the most wonderful of all its accidents
      is how the population can ever calm and recur to the monotony of ordinary life. When all this
      happens, too, in a capital blessed with purple skies, where the moonlight is equal to our
      sunshine, and where half the population sleep in the open air and wish for no roof but the
      heavens, existence is a dream of phantasy and perpetual loveliness, and one is at last forced
      to believe that there is some miraculous and supernatural agency that provides the
      ever-enduring excitement and ceaseless incidents of grace and beauty.</p>
     <p>After the great ceremony of the morrow in the cathedral, and when Myra, kneeling at the
      altar with her husband, received, under a canopy of silver brocade, the blessings of a
      cardinal and her people, day followed day with court balls and municipal banquets, state
      visits to operas, and reviews of sumptuous troops. At length the end of all this pageantry and
      enthusiasm approached, and amid a blaze of fireworks, the picturesque population of this
      fascinating city tried to return to ordinary feeling and to common sense.</p>
     <p>If amid this graceful hubbub and this glittering riot any one could have found time to
      remark the carriage and conduct of an individual, one might have observed, and perhaps been
      surprised at, the change in those of Miss Neuchatel. That air of pensive resignation which
      distinguished her seemed to have vanished. She never wore that doleful look for which she was
      too remarkable in London saloons, and which marred a countenance favoured by nature and a form
      intended for gaiety and grace. Perhaps it was the influence of the climate, perhaps the
      excitement of the scene, perhaps some rapture with the wondrous fortunes of the friend whom
      she adored, but Adriana seemed suddenly to sympathise with everybody and to appreciate
      everything; her face was radiant, she was in every dance, and visited churches and museums,
      and palaces and galleries, with keen delight. With many charms, the intimate friend of their
      sovereign, and herself known to be noble and immensely rich, Adriana became the fashion, and a
      crowd of princes were ever watching her smiles, and sometimes offering her their sighs.</p>
     <p>“I think you enjoy our visit more than any one of us,” said Endymion to her one day, with
      some feeling of surprise.</p>
     <p>“Well, one cannot mope for ever,” said Miss Neuchatel; “I have passed my life in thinking of
      one subject, and I feel now it made me very stupid.”</p>
     <p>Endymion felt embarrassed, and, though generally ready, had no repartee at command. Lord
      Waldershare, however, came to his relief, and claimed Adriana for the impending dance.</p>
     <p>This wondrous marriage was a grand subject for “our own correspondents,” and they abounded.
      Among them were Jawett and St. Barbe. St. Barbe hated Jawett, as indeed he did all his
      brethren, but his appointment in this instance he denounced as an infamous job. “Merely to
      allow him to travel in foreign parts, which he has never done, without a single qualification
      for the office! However, it will ruin his paper, that is some consolation. Fancy sending here
      a man who has never used his pen except about those dismal statistics, and what he calls first
      principles! I hate his style, so neat and frigid. No colour, sir. I hate his short sentences,
      like a dog barking; we want a word-painter here, sir. My description of the wedding sold one
      hundred and fifty thousand, and it is selling now. If the proprietors were gentlemen, they
      would have sent me an unlimited credit, instead of their paltry fifty pounds a day and my
      expenses; but you never meet a liberal man now,—no such animal known. What I want you to do
      for me, Lord Waldershare, is to get me invited to the Villa Aurea when the court moves there.
      It will be private life there, and that is the article the British public want now. They are
      satiated with ceremonies and festivals. They want to know what the royal pair have for dinner
      when they are alone, how they pass their evenings, and whether the queen drives ponies.”</p>
     <p>“So far as I am concerned,” said Waldershare, “they shall remain state secrets.”</p>
     <p>“I have received no special favours here,” rejoined St. Barbe, “though, with my claims, I
      might have counted on the uttermost. However, it is always so. I must depend on my own
      resources. I have a retainer, I can tell you, my lord, from the ‘Rigdum Funidos,’ in my
      pocket, and it is in my power to keep up such a crackling of jokes and sarcasms that a very
      different view would soon be entertained in Europe of what is going on here than is now the
      fashion. The ‘Rigdum Funidos’ is on the breakfast-table of all England, and sells thousands in
      every capital of the world. You do not appreciate its power; you will now feel it.”</p>
     <p>“I also am a subscriber to the ‘Rigdum Funidos,’” said Waldershare, “and tell you frankly,
      Mr. St. Barbe, that if I see in its columns the slightest allusion to any persons or incident
      in this country, I will take care that you be instantly consigned to the galleys; and, this
      being a liberal government, I can do that without even the ceremony of a primary inquiry.”</p>
     <p>“You do not mean that?” said St. Barbe; “of course, I was only jesting. It is not likely
      that I should say or do anything disagreeable to those whom I look upon as my patrons—I may
      say friends—through life. It makes me almost weep when I remember my early connection with Mr.
      Ferrars, now an under-secretary of state, and who will mount higher. I never had a chance of
      being a minister, though I suppose I am not more incapable than others who get the silver
      spoon into their mouths. And then his divine sister! Quite an heroic character! I never had a
      sister, and so I never had even a chance of being nearly related to royalty. But so it has
      been throughout my life. No luck, my lord; no luck. And then they say one is misanthropical.
      Hang it! who can help being misanthropical when he finds everybody getting on in life except
      himself?”</p>
     <p>The court moved to their favourite summer residence, a Palladian palace on a blue lake, its
      banks clothed with forests abounding with every species of game, and beyond them loftier
      mountains. The king was devoted to sport, and Endymion was always among his companions.
      Waldershare rather attached himself to the ladies, who made gay parties floating in gondolas,
      and refreshed themselves with picnics in sylvan retreats. It was supposed Lord Waldershare was
      a great admirer of the Princess of Montserrat, who in return referred to him as that “lovable
      eccentricity.” As the autumn advanced, parties of guests of high distinction, carefully
      arranged, periodically arrived. Now, there was more ceremony, and every evening the circle was
      formed, while the king and queen exchanged words, and sometimes ideas, with those who were so
      fortunate as to be under their roof. Frequently there were dramatic performances, and
      sometimes a dance. The Princess of Montserrat was invaluable in these scenes; vivacious,
      imaginative, a consummate mimic, her countenance, though not beautiful, was full of charm.
      What was strange, Adriana took a great fancy to her Highness, and they were seldom separated.
      The only cloud for Endymion in this happy life was, that every day the necessity of his return
      to England was more urgent, and every day the days vanished more quickly. That return to
      England, once counted by weeks, would soon be counted by hours. He had conferred once or twice
      with Waldershare on the subject, who always turned the conversation; at last Endymion reminded
      him that the time of his departure was at hand, and that, originally, it had been agreed they
      should return together.</p>
     <p>“Yes, my dear Ferrars, we did so agree, but the agreement was permissive, not compulsory. My
      views are changed. Perhaps I shall never return to England again; I think of being naturalised
      here.”</p>
     <p>The queen was depressed at the prospect of being separated from her brother. Sometimes she
      remonstrated with him for his devotion to sport which deprived her of his society; frequently
      in a morning she sent for him to her boudoir, that they might talk together as in old times.
      “The king has invited Lord and Lady Beaumaris to pay us a visit, and they are coming at once.
      I had hoped the dear Hainaults might have visited us here. I think she would have liked it.
      However, they will certainly pass the winter with us. It is some consolation to me not to lose
      Adriana.”</p>
     <p>“The greatest,” said Endymion, “and she seems so happy here. She seems quite changed.”</p>
     <p>“I hope she is happier,” said the queen, “but I trust she is not changed. I think her nearly
      perfection. So pure, even so exalted a mind, joined with so sweet a temper, I have never met.
      And she is very much admired too, I can tell you. The Prince of Arragon would be on his knees
      to her to-morrow, if she would only give a single smile. But she smiles enough with the
      Princess of Montserrat. I heard her the other day absolutely in uncontrollable laughter. That
      is a strange friendship; it amuses me.”</p>
     <p>“The princess has immense resource.”</p>
     <p>The queen suddenly rose from her seat; her countenance was disturbed.</p>
     <p>“Why do we talk of her, or of any other trifler of the court, when there hangs over us so
      great a sorrow, Endymion, as our separation? Endymion, my best beloved,” and she threw her
      arms round his neck, “my heart! my life! Is it possible that you can leave me, and so
      miserable as I am?”</p>
     <p>“Miserable!”</p>
     <p>“Yes! miserable when I think of your position—and even my own. Mine own has risen like a
      palace in a dream, and may vanish like one. But that would not be a calamity if you were safe.
      If I quitted this world to-morrow, where would you be? It gives me sleepless nights and
      anxious days. If you really loved me as you say, you would save me this. I am haunted with the
      perpetual thought that all this glittering prosperity will vanish as it did with our father.
      God forbid that, under any circumstances, it should lead to such an end—but who knows? Fate is
      terribly stern; ironically just. O Endymion! if you really love me, your twin, half of your
      blood and life, who have laboured for you so much, and thought for you so much, and prayed for
      you so much—and yet I sometimes feel have done so little—O Endymion! my adored, my own
      Endymion, if you wish to preserve my life—if you wish me not only to live, but really to be
      happy as I ought to be and could be, but for one dark thought, help me, aid me, save me—you
      can, and by one single act.”</p>
     <p>“One single act!”</p>
     <p>“Yes! marry Adriana.”</p>
     <p>“Ah!” and he sighed.</p>
     <p>“Yes, Adriana, to whom we both of us owe everything. Were it not for Adriana, you would not
      be here, you would be nothing,” and she whispered some words which made him start, and
      alternately blush and look pale.</p>
     <p>“Is it possible?” he exclaimed. “My sister, my beloved sister, I have tried to keep my brain
      cool in many trials. But I feel, as it were, as if life were too much for me. You counsel me
      to that which we should all repent.”</p>
     <p>“Yes, I know it; you may for a moment think it a sacrifice, but believe me, that is all
      phantasy. I know you think your heart belongs to another. I will grant everything, willingly
      grant everything you could say of her. Yes, I admit, she is beautiful, she has many charms,
      has been to you a faithful friend, you delight in her society; such things have happened
      before to many men, to every man they say they happen, but that has not prevented them from
      being wise, and very happy too. Your present position, if you persist in it, is one most
      perilous. You have no root in the country; but for an accident you could not maintain the
      public position you have nobly gained. As for the great crowning consummation of your life,
      which we dreamed over at unhappy Hurstley, which I have sometimes dared to prophesy, that must
      be surrendered. The country at the best will look upon you only as a reputable adventurer to
      be endured, even trusted and supported, in some secondary post, but nothing more. I touch on
      this, for I see it is useless to speak of myself and my own fate and feelings; only remember,
      Endymion, I have never deceived you. I cannot endure any longer this state of affairs. When in
      a few days we part, we shall never meet again. And all the devotion of Myra will end in your
      destroying her.”</p>
     <p>“My own, my beloved Myra, do with me what you like. If ——”</p>
     <p>At this moment there was a gentle tap at the door, and the king entered.</p>
     <p>“My angel,” he said, “and you too, my dear Endymion. I have some news from England which I
      fear may distress you. Lord Montfort is dead.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
     <p>There was ever, when separated, an uninterrupted correspondence between Berengaria and
      Endymion. They wrote to each other every day, so that when they met again there was no void in
      their lives and mutual experience, and each was acquainted with almost every feeling and
      incident that had been proved, or had occurred, since they parted. The startling news,
      however, communicated by the king had not previously reached Endymion, because he was on the
      eve of his return to England, and his correspondents had been requested to direct their future
      letters to his residence in London.</p>
     <p>His voyage home was an agitated one, and not sanguine or inspiriting. There was a terrible
      uncertainty in the future. What were the feelings of Lady Montfort towards himself? Friendly,
      kind, affectionate, in a certain sense, even devoted, no doubt; but all consistent with a deep
      and determined friendship which sought and wished for no return more ardent. But now she was
      free. Yes, but would she again forfeit her freedom? And if she did, would it not be to attain
      some great end, probably the great end of her life? Lady Montfort was a woman of far-reaching
      ambition. In a certain degree, she had married to secure her lofty aims; and yet it was only
      by her singular energy, and the playfulness and high spirit of her temperament, that the
      sacrifice had not proved a failure; her success, however, was limited, for the ally on who she
      had counted rarely assisted and never sympathised with her. It was true she admired and even
      loved her husband; her vanity, which was not slight, was gratified by her conquest of one whom
      it had seemed no one could subdue, and who apparently placed at her feet all the power and
      magnificence which she appreciated.</p>
     <p>Poor Endymion, who loved her passionately, over whom she exercised the influence of a
      divinity, who would do nothing without consulting her, and who was moulded, and who wished to
      be moulded, by her inspiring will, was also a shrewd man of the world, and did not permit his
      sentiment to cloud his perception of life and its doings. He felt that Lady Montfort had
      fallen from a lofty position, and she was not of a temperament that would quietly brook her
      fate. Instead of being the mistress of castles and palaces, with princely means, and all the
      splendid accidents of life at her command, she was now a dowager with a jointure! Still young,
      with her charms unimpaired, heightened even by the maturity of her fascinating qualities,
      would she endure this? She might retain her friendship for one who, as his sister ever
      impressed upon him, had no root in the land, and even that friendship, he felt conscious, must
      yield much of its entireness and intimacy to the influence of new ties; but for their lives
      ever being joined together, as had sometimes been his wild dreams, his cheek, though alone,
      burned with the consciousness of his folly and self-deception.</p>
     <p>“He is one of our rising statesmen,” whispered the captain of the vessel to a passenger, as
      Endymion, silent, lonely, and absorbed, walked, as was his daily custom, the quarterdeck. “I
      daresay he has a good load on his mind. Do you know, I would sooner be a captain of a ship
      than a minister of state?”</p>
     <p>Poor Endymion! Yes, he bore his burthen, but it was not secrets of state that overwhelmed
      him. If his mind for a moment quitted the contemplation of Lady Montfort, it was only to
      encounter the recollection of a heart-rending separation from his sister, and his strange and
      now perplexing relations with Adriana.</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort had passed the summer, as he had announced, at Princedown, and alone; that is
      to say, without Lady Montfort. She wrote to him frequently, and if she omitted doing so for a
      longer interval than usual, he would indite to her a little note, always courteous, sometimes
      even almost kind, reminding her that her letters amused him, and that of late they had been
      rarer than he wished. Lady Montfort herself made Montfort Castle her home, paying sometimes a
      visit to her family in the neighbourhood, and sometimes receiving them and other guests. Lord
      Montfort himself did not live in absolute solitude. He had society always at command. He
      always had a court about him; equerries, and secretaries, and doctors, and odd and amusing men
      whom they found out for him, and who were well pleased to find themselves in his beautiful and
      magnificent Princedown, wandering in woods and parks and pleasaunces, devouring his choice
       <hi>entrees</hi>, and quaffing his curious wines. Sometimes he dined with them, sometimes a
      few dined with him, sometimes he was not seen for weeks; but whether he were visible or not,
      he was the subject of constant thought and conversation by all under his roof.</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort, it may be remembered, was a great fisherman. It was the only sport which
      retained a hold upon him. The solitude, the charming scenery, and the requisite skill,
      combined to please him. He had a love for nature, and he gratified it in this pursuit. His
      domain abounded in those bright chalky streams which the trout love. He liked to watch the
      moor-hens, too, and especially a kingfisher.</p>
     <p>Lord Montfort came home late one day after much wading. It had been a fine day for anglers,
      soft and not too bright, and he had been tempted to remain long in the water. He drove home
      rapidly, but it was in an open carriage, and when the sun set there was a cold autumnal
      breeze. He complained at night, and said he had been chilled. There was always a doctor under
      the roof, who felt his patient’s pulse, ordered the usual remedies, and encouraged him. Lord
      Montfort passed a bad night, and his physician in the morning found fever, and feared there
      were symptoms of pleurisy. He prescribed accordingly, but summoned from town two great
      authorities. The great authorities did not arrive until the next day. They approved of
      everything that had been done, but shook their heads. “No immediate danger, but serious.”</p>
     <p>Four-and-twenty hours afterwards they inquired of Lord Montfort whether they should send for
      his wife. “On no account whatever,” he replied. “My orders on this head are absolute.”
      Nevertheless, they did send for Lady Montfort, and as there was even then a telegraph to the
      north, Berengaria, who departed from her castle instantly, and travelled all night, arrived in
      eight-and-forty hours at Princedown. The state of Lord Montfort then was critical.</p>
     <p>It was broken to Lord Montfort that his wife had arrived.</p>
     <p>“I perceive then,” he replied, “that I am going to die, because I am disobeyed.”</p>
     <p>These were the last words he uttered. He turned in his bed as it were to conceal his
      countenance, and expired without a sigh or sound.</p>
     <p>There was not a single person at Princedown in whom Lady Montfort could confide. She had
      summoned the family solicitor, but he could not arrive until the next day, and until he came
      she insisted that none of her late lord’s papers should be touched. She at first thought he
      had made a will, because otherwise all his property would go to his cousin, whom he
      particularly hated, and yet on reflection she could hardly fancy his making a will. It was a
      trouble to him—a disagreeable trouble; and there was nobody she knew whom he would care to
      benefit. He was not a man who would leave anything to hospitals and charities. Therefore, on
      the whole, she arrived at the conclusion he had not made a will, though all the guests at
      Princedown were of a different opinion, and each was calculating the amount of his own
      legacy.</p>
     <p>At last the lawyer arrived, and he brought the will with him. It was very short, and not
      very recent. Everything he had in the world except the settled estates, Montfort Castle and
      Montfort House, he bequeathed to his wife. It was a vast inheritance; not only Princedown, but
      great accumulations of personal property, for Lord Montfort was fond of amassing, and admired
      the sweet simplicity of the three per cents.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXIX</head>
     <p>When Endymion arrived in London he found among his letters two brief notes from Lady
      Montfort; one hurriedly written at Montfort Castle at the moment of her departure, and another
      from Princedown, with these words only, “All is over.” More than a week had elapsed since the
      last was written, and he had already learnt from the newspapers that the funeral had taken
      place. It was a painful but still necessary duty to fulfil, to write to her, which he did, but
      he received no answer to his letter of sympathy, and to a certain degree, of condolence. Time
      flew on, but he could not venture to write again, and without any absolute cause for his
      discomfort, he felt harassed and unhappy. He had been so accustomed all his life to exist
      under the genial influence of women that his present days seemed lone and dark. His sister and
      Berengaria, two of the most gifted and charming beings in the world, had seemed to agree that
      their first duty had ever been to sympathise with his fortunes and to aid them. Even his
      correspondence with Myra was changed. There was a tone of constraint in their communications;
      perhaps it was the great alteration in her position that occasioned it? His heart assured him
      that such was not the case. He felt deeply and acutely what was the cause. The subject most
      interesting to both of them could not be touched on. And then he thought of Adriana, and
      contrasted his dull and solitary home in Hill Street with what it might have been, graced by
      her presence, animated by her devotion, and softened by the sweetness of her temper.</p>
     <p>Endymion began to feel that the run of his good fortune was dried. His sister, when he had a
      trouble, would never hear of this; she always held that the misery and calamities of their
      early years had exhausted the influence of their evil stars, and apparently she had been
      right, and perhaps she would have always been right had he not been perverse, and thwarted her
      in the most important circumstances of his life.</p>
     <p>In this state of mind, there was nothing for him to do but to plunge into business; and
      affairs of state are a cure for many cares and sorrows. What are our petty annoyances and
      griefs when we have to guard the fortunes and the honour of a nation?</p>
     <p>The November cabinets had commenced, and this brought all the chiefs to town, Sidney Wilton
      among them; and his society was always a great pleasure to Endymion; the only social pleasure
      now left to him was a little dinner at Mr. Wilton’s, and little dinners there abounded. Mr.
      Wilton knew all the persons that he was always thinking about, but whom, it might be noticed,
      they seemed to agree now rarely to mention. As for the rest, there was nobody to call upon in
      the delightful hours between official duties and dinner. No Lady Roehampton now, no brilliant
      Berengaria, and not even the gentle Imogene with her welcome smile. He looked in at the
      Coventry Club, a club of fashion, and also much frequented by diplomatists. There were a good
      many persons there, and a foreign minister immediately buttonholed the Under-Secretary of
      State.</p>
     <p>“I called at the Foreign Office to-day,” said the foreign minister. “I assure you it is very
      pressing.”</p>
     <p>“I had the American with me,” said Endymion, “and he is very lengthy. However, as to your
      business, I think we might talk it over here, and perhaps settle it.” And so they left the
      room together.</p>
     <p>“I wonder what is going to happen to that gentleman,” said Mr. Ormsby, glancing at Endymion,
      and speaking to Mr. Cassilis.</p>
     <p>“Why?” replied Mr. Cassilis, “is anything up?”</p>
     <p>“Will he marry Lady Montfort?”</p>
     <p>“Poh!” said Mr. Cassilis.</p>
     <p>“You may poh!” said Mr. Ormsby, “but he was a great favourite.”</p>
     <p>“Lady Montfort will never marry. She had always a poodle, and always will have. She was
      never so <hi>liee</hi> with Ferrars as with the Count of Ferroll, and half a dozen others. She
      must have a slave.”</p>
     <p>“A very good mistress with thirty thousand a year.”</p>
     <p>“She has not that,” said Mr. Cassilis doubtingly.</p>
     <p>“What do you put Princedown at?” said Mr. Ormsby.</p>
     <p>“That I can tell you to a T,” replied Mr. Cassilis, “for it was offered to me when old
      Rambrooke died. You will never get twelve thousand a year out of it.”</p>
     <p>“Well, I will answer for half a million consols,” said Ormsby, “for my lawyer, when he made
      a little investment for me the other day, saw the entry himself in the bank-books; our names
      are very near, you know—M, and O. Then there is her jointure, something like ten thousand a
      year.”</p>
     <p>“No, no; not seven.”</p>
     <p>“Well, that would do.”</p>
     <p>“And what is the amount of your little investment in consols altogether, Ormsby?”</p>
     <p>“Well, I believe I top Montfort,” said Mr. Ormsby with a complacent smile, “but then you
      know, I am not a swell like you; I have no land.”</p>
     <p>“Lady Montfort, thirty thousand a year,” said Mr. Cassilis musingly. “She is only thirty.
      She is a woman who will set the Thames on fire, but she will never marry. Do you dine to-day,
      by any chance, with Sidney Wilton?”</p>
     <p>When Endymion returned home this evening, he found a letter from Lady Montfort. It was a
      month since he had written to her. He was so nervous that he absolutely for a moment could not
      break the seal, and the palpitation of his heart was almost overpowering.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort thanked him for his kind letter, which she ought to have acknowledged before,
      but she had been very busy—indeed, quite overwhelmed with affairs. She wished to see him, but
      was sorry she could not ask him to come down to Princedown, as she was living in complete
      retirement, only her aunt with her, Lady Gertrude, whom, she believed, he knew. He was aware,
      probably, how good Lord Montfort had been to her. Sincerely she could say, nothing could have
      been more unexpected. If she could have seen her husband before the fatal moment, it would
      have been a consolation to her. He had always been kind to Endymion; she really believed
      sometimes that Lord Montfort was even a little attached to him. She should like Endymion to
      have some souvenir of her late husband. Would he choose something, or would he leave it to
      her?</p>
     <p>One would rather agree, from the tone of this letter, that Mr. Cassilis knew what he was
      talking about. It fell rather odd on Endymion’s heart, and he passed a night of some
      disquietude; not one of those nights, exactly, when we feel that the end of the world has at
      length arrived, and that we are the first victim, but a night when you slumber rather than
      sleep, and wake with the consciousness of some indefinable chagrin.</p>
     <p>This was a dull Christmas for Endymion Ferrars. He passed it, as he had passed others, at
      Gaydene, but what a contrast to the old assemblies there! Every source of excitement that
      could make existence absolutely fascinating seemed then to unite in his happy fate. Entrancing
      love and the very romance of domestic affection, and friendships of honour and happiness, and
      all the charms of an accomplished society, and the feeling of a noble future, and the present
      and urgent interest in national affairs—all gone, except some ambition which might tend to
      consequences not more successful than those that had ultimately visited his house with
      irreparable calamity.</p>
     <p>The meeting of parliament was a great relief to Endymion. Besides his office, he had now the
      House of Commons to occupy him. He was never absent from his place; no little runnings up to
      Montfort House or Hill Street just to tell them the authentic news, or snatch a hasty repast
      with furtive delight, with persons still more delightful, and flattering one’s self all the
      time that, so far as absence was concerned, the fleetness of one’s gifted brougham horse
      really made it no difference between Mayfair and Bellamy’s.</p>
     <p>Endymion had replied, but not very quickly, to Lady Montfort’s letter, and he had heard from
      her again, but her letter requiring no reply, the correspondence had dropped. It was the
      beginning of March when she wrote to him to say, that she was obliged to come to town to see
      her lawyer and transact some business; that she would be “at papa’s in Grosvenor Square,”
      though the house was shut up, on a certain day, that she much wished to see Endymion, and
      begged him to call on her.</p>
     <p>It was a trying moment when about noon he lifted the knocker to Grosvenor Square. The door
      was not opened rapidly, and the delay made him more nervous. He almost wished the door would
      never open. He was shown into a small back room on the ground floor in which was a bookcase,
      and which chamber, in the language of Grosvenor Square, is called a library.</p>
     <p>“Her ladyship will see you presently,” said the servant, who had come up from
      Princedown.</p>
     <p>Endymion was standing before the fire, and as nervous as a man could well be. He sighed, and
      he sighed more than once. His breathing was oppressed; he felt that life was too short to
      permit us to experience such scenes and situations. He heard the lock of the door move, and it
      required all his manliness to endure it.</p>
     <p>She entered; she was in weeds, but they became her admirably; her countenance was grave and
      apparently with an effort to command it. She did not move hurriedly, but held out both her
      hands to Endymion and retained his, and all without speaking. Her lips then seemed to move,
      when, rather suddenly, withdrawing her right hand, and placing it on his shoulder and burying
      her face in her arm, she wept.</p>
     <p>He led her soothingly to a seat, and took a chair by her side. Not a word had yet been
      spoken by either of them; only a murmur of sympathy on the part of Endymion. Lady Montfort
      spoke first.</p>
     <p>“I am weaker than I thought, but it is a great trial.” And then she said how sorry she was,
      that she could not receive him at Princedown; but she thought it best that he should not go
      there. “I have a great deal of business to transact—you would not believe how much. I do not
      dislike it, it occupies me, it employs my mind. I have led so active a life, that solitude is
      rather too much for me. Among other business, I must buy a town house, and that is the most
      difficult of all affairs. There never was so great a city with such small houses. I shall feel
      the loss of Montfort House, though I never used it half so much as I wished. I want a mansion;
      I should think you could help me in this. When I return to society, I mean to receive. There
      must be therefore good reception rooms; if possible, more than good. And now let us talk about
      our friends. Tell me all about your royal sister, and this new marriage; it rather surprised
      me, but I think it excellent. Ah! you can keep a secret, but you see it is no use having a
      secret with me. Even in solitude everything reaches me.”</p>
     <p>“I assure you most seriously, that I can annex no meaning to what you are saying.”</p>
     <p>“Then I can hardly think it true; and yet it came from high authority, and it was not told
      me as a real secret.”</p>
     <p>“A marriage, and whose?”</p>
     <p>“Miss Neuchatel’s,—Adriana.”</p>
     <p>“And to whom?” inquired Endymion, changing colour.</p>
     <p>“To Lord Waldershare.”</p>
     <p>“To Lord Waldershare!”</p>
     <p>“And has not your sister mentioned it to you?”</p>
     <p>“Not a word; it cannot be true.”</p>
     <p>“I will give to you my authority,” said Lady Montfort. “Though I came here in the twilight
      of a hired brougham, and with a veil, I was caught before I could enter the house by, of all
      people in the world, Mrs. Rodney. And she told me this in what she called ‘real confidence,’
      and it was announced to her in a letter from her sister, Lady Beaumaris. They seem all
      delighted with the match.”</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXX</head>
     <p>The marriage of Adriana was not an event calculated to calm the uneasy and dissatisfied
      temperament of Endymion. The past rendered it impossible that this announcement should not in
      some degree affect him. Then the silence of his sister on such a subject was too significant;
      the silence even of Waldershare. Somehow or other, it seemed that all these once dear and
      devoted friends stood in different relations to him and to each other from what they once
      filled. They had become more near and intimate together, but he seemed without the pale; he,
      that Endymion, who once seemed the prime object, if not the centre, of all their thoughts and
      sentiment. And why was this? What was the influence that had swayed him to a line contrary to
      what was once their hopes and affections? Had he an evil genius? And was it she? Horrible
      thought!</p>
     <p>The interview with Lady Montfort had been deeply interesting—had for a moment restored him
      to himself. Had it not been for this news, he might have returned home, soothed, gratified,
      even again indulging in dreams. But this news had made him ponder; had made him feel what he
      had lost, and forced him to ask himself what he had gained.</p>
     <p>There was one thing he had gained, and that was the privilege of calling on Lady Montfort
      the next day. That was a fact that sometimes dissipated all the shadows. Under the immediate
      influence of her presence, he became spell-bound as of yore, and in the intoxication of her
      beauty, the brightness of her mind, and her ineffable attraction, he felt he would be content
      with any lot, provided he might retain her kind thoughts and pass much of his life in her
      society.</p>
     <p>She was only staying three or four days in town, and was much engaged in the mornings; but
      Endymion called on her every afternoon, and sate talking with her till dinner-time, and they
      both dined very late. As he really on personal and domestic affairs never could have any
      reserve with her, he told her, in that complete confidence in which they always indulged, of
      the extraordinary revelation which his sister had made to him about the parliamentary
      qualification. Lady Montfort was deeply interested in this; she was even agitated, and looked
      very grave.</p>
     <p>“I am sorry,” she said, “we know this. Things cannot remain now as they are. You cannot
      return the money, that would be churlish; besides, you cannot return all the advantages which
      it gained for you, and they must certainly be considered part of the gift, and the most
      precious; and then, too, it would betray what your sister rightly called a ‘sacred
      confidence.’ And yet something must be done—you must let me think. Do not mention it again.”
      And then they talked a little of public affairs. Lady Montfort saw no one, and heard from no
      one now; but judging from the journals, she thought the position of the government feeble.
      “There cannot be a Protectionist government,” she said; “and yet that is the only
      parliamentary party of importance. Things will go on till some blow, and perhaps a slight one,
      will upset you all. And then who is to succeed? I think some queer <hi>melange</hi> got up
      perhaps by Mr. Bertie Tremaine.”</p>
     <p>The last day came. She parted from Endymion with kindness, but not with tenderness. He was
      choking with emotion, and tried to imitate her calmness.</p>
     <p>“Am I to write to you?” he asked in a faltering voice.</p>
     <p>“Of course you are,” she said, “every day, and tell me all the news.”</p>
     <p>The Hainaults, and the Beaumaris, and Waldershare, did not return to England until some time
      after Easter. The marriage was to take place in June—Endymion was to be Waldershare’s best
      man. There were many festivities, and he was looked upon as an indispensable guest in all.
      Adriana received his congratulations with animation, but with affection. She thanked him for a
      bracelet which he had presented to her; “I value it more,” she said, “than all my other
      presents together, except what dear Waldershare has given to me.” Even with that exception,
      the estimate was high, for never a bride in any land ever received the number of splendid
      offerings which crowded the tables of Lord Hainault’s new palace, which he had just built in
      Park Lane. There was not a Neuchatel in existence, and they flourished in every community, who
      did not send her, at least, a riviere of brilliants. King Florestan and his queen sent
      offerings worthy of their resplendent throne and their invaluable friendship. But nothing
      surpassed, nothing approached, the contents of a casket, which, a day before the wedding,
      arrived at Hainault House. It came from a foreign land, and Waldershare superintended the
      opening of the case, and the appearance of a casket of crimson velvet, with genuine
      excitement. But when it was opened! There was a coronet of brilliants; a necklace of
      brilliants and emeralds, and all the stones more than precious; gems of Golconda no longer
      obtainable, and lustrous companions which only could have been created in the hot earth of
      Asia. From whom? Not a glimpse of meaning. All that was written, in a foreign handwriting on a
      sheet of notepaper, was, “For the Lady Viscountess Waldershare.”</p>
     <p>“When the revolution comes,” said Lord Hainault, “Lord Waldershare and my daughter must turn
      jewellers. Their stock in trade is ready.”</p>
     <p>The correspondence between Lady Montfort and Endymion had resumed its ancient habit. They
      wrote to each other every day, and one day she told him that she had purchased a house, and
      that she must come up to town to examine and to furnish it. She probably should be a month in
      London, and remaining there until the end of the season, in whose amusements and business, of
      course, she could not share. She should “be at papa’s,” though he and his family were in town;
      but that was no reason why Endymion should not call on her. And he came, and called every day.
      Lady Montfort was full of her new house; it was in Carlton Gardens, the house she always
      wished, always intended to have. There is nothing like will; everybody can do exactly what
      they like in this world, provided they really like it. Sometimes they think they do, but in
      general, it is a mistake. Lady Montfort, it seemed, was a woman who always could do what she
      liked. She could do what she liked with Endymion Ferrars; that was quite certain. Supposed by
      men to have a strong will and a calm judgment, he was a nose of wax with this woman. He was
      fascinated by her, and he had been fascinated now for nearly ten years. What would be the
      result of this irresistible influence upon him? Would it make or mar those fortunes that once
      seemed so promising? The philosophers of White’s and the Coventry were generally of opinion
      that he had no chance.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort was busy every morning with her new house, but she never asked Endymion to
      accompany her, though it seemed natural to do so. But he saw her every day, and “papa,” who
      was a most kind and courtly gentleman, would often ask him, “if he had nothing better to do,”
      to dine there, and he dined there frequently; and if he were engaged, he was always of opinion
      that he had nothing better to do.</p>
     <p>At last, however, the season was over; the world had gone to Goodwood, and Lady Montfort was
      about to depart to Princedown. It was a dreary prospect for Endymion, and he could not conceal
      his feelings. He could not help saying one day, “Do you know, now that you are going I almost
      wish to die.”</p>
     <p>Alas! she only laughed. But he looked grave. “I am very unhappy,” he sighed rather than
      uttered.</p>
     <p>She looked at him with seriousness. “I do not think our separation need be very long. Papa
      and all my family are coming to me in September to pay me a very long visit. I really do not
      see why you should not come too.”</p>
     <p>Endymion’s countenance mantled with rapture. “If I might come, I think I should be the
      happiest of men!”</p>
     <p>The month that was to elapse before his visit, Endymion was really, as he said, the happiest
      of men; at least, the world thought him so. He seemed to walk upon tip-toe. Parliament was
      prorogued, office was consigned to permanent secretaries, and our youthful statesman seemed
      only to live to enjoy, and add to, the revelry of existence. Now at Cowes, now stalking in the
      Highlands, dancing at balls in the wilderness, and running races of fantastic feats, full of
      health, and frolic, and charm; he was the delight of society, while, the whole time, he had
      only one thought, and that was the sacred day when he should again see the being whom he
      adored, and that in her beautiful home, which her presence made more lovely.</p>
     <p>Yes! he was again at Princedown, in the bosom of her family; none others there; treated like
      one of themselves. The courtly father pressed his hand; the amiable and refined mother smiled
      upon him; the daughters, pretty, and natural as the air, treated him as if they were sisters,
      and even the eldest son, who generally hates you, after a little stiffness, announced in a
      tone never questioned under the family roof, that “Ferrars was a first-rate shot.”</p>
     <p>And so a month rolled on; immensely happy, as any man who has loved, and loved in a
      beautiful scene, alone can understand. One morning Lady Montfort said to him, “I must go up to
      London about my house. I want to go and return the same day. Do you know, I think you had
      better come with me? You shall give me a luncheon in Hill Street, and we shall be back by the
      last train. It will be late, but we shall wake in the morning in the country, and that I
      always think a great thing.”</p>
     <p>And so it happened; they rose early and arrived in town in time to give them a tolerably
      long morning. She took him to her house in Carlton Gardens, and showed to him exactly how it
      was all she wanted; accommodation for a first-rate establishment; and then the reception
      rooms, few houses in London could compare with them; a gallery and three saloons. Then they
      descended to the dining-room. “It is a dining-room, not a banqueting hall,” she said, “which
      we had at Montfort House, but still it is much larger than most dining-rooms in London. But, I
      think this room, at least I hope you do, quite charming,” and she took him to a room almost as
      large as the dining-room, and looking into the garden. It was fitted up with exquisite taste;
      calm subdued colouring, with choice marble busts of statesmen, ancient and of our times, but
      the shelves were empty.</p>
     <p>“They are empty,” she said, “but the volumes to fill them are already collected. Yes,” she
      added in a tremulous voice, and slightly pressing the arm on which she leant. “If you will
      deign to accept it, this is the chamber I have prepared for you.”</p>
     <p>“Dearest of women!” and he took her hand.</p>
     <p>“Yes,” she murmured, “help me to realise the dream of my life;” and she touched his forehead
      with her lips.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXI</head>
     <p>The marriage of Mr. Ferrars with Lady Montfort surprised some, but, on the whole, pleased
      everybody. They were both of them popular, and no one seemed to envy them their happiness and
      prosperity. The union took place at a season of the year when there was no London world to
      observe and to criticise. It was a quiet ceremony; they went down to Northumberland to Lady
      Montfort’s father, and they were married in his private chapel. After that they went off
      immediately to pay a visit to King Florestan and his queen; Myra had sent her a loving
      letter.</p>
     <p>“Perhaps it will be the first time that your sister ever saw me with satisfaction,” remarked
      Lady Montfort, “but I think she will love me now! I always loved her; perhaps because she is
      so like you.”</p>
     <p>It was a happy meeting and a delightful visit. They did not talk much of the past. The
      enormous change in the position of their host and hostess since the first days of their
      acquaintance, and, on their own part, some indefinite feeling of delicate reserve, combined to
      make them rather dwell on a present which was full of novelty so attractive and so absorbing.
      In his manner, the king was unchanged; he was never a demonstrative person, but simple,
      unaffected, rather silent; with a sweet temper and a tender manner, he seemed to be gratified
      that he had the power of conferring happiness on those around him. His feeling to his queen
      was one of idolatry, and she received Berengaria as a sister and a much-loved one. Their
      presence and the season of the year made their life a festival, and when they parted, there
      were entreaties and promises that the visit should be often repeated.</p>
     <p>“Adieu! my Endymion,” said Myra at the last moment they were alone. “All has happened for
      you beyond my hopes; all now is safe. I might wish we were in the same land, but not if I lost
      my husband, whom I adore.”</p>
     <p>The reason that forced them to curtail their royal visit was the state of politics at home,
      which had suddenly become critical. There were symptoms, and considerable ones, of disturbance
      and danger when they departed for their wedding tour, but they could not prevail on themselves
      to sacrifice a visit on which they had counted so much, and which could not be fulfilled on
      another occasion under the same interesting circumstances. Besides, the position of Mr.
      Ferrars, though an important, was a subordinate one, and though cabinet ministers were not
      justified in leaving the country, an under-secretary of state and a bridegroom might, it would
      seem, depart on his irresponsible holiday. Mr. Sidney Wilton, however, shook his head; “I do
      not like the state of affairs,” he said, “I think you will have to come back sooner than you
      imagine.”</p>
     <p>“You are not going to be so foolish as to have an early session?” inquired Lady
      Montfort.</p>
     <p>He only shrugged his shoulders, and said, “We are in a mess.”</p>
     <p>What mess? and what was the state of affairs?</p>
     <p>This had happened. At the end of the autumn, his Holiness the Pope had made half a dozen new
      cardinals, and to the surprise of the world, and the murmurs of the Italians, there appeared
      among them the name of an Englishman, Nigel Penruddock, archbishop <hi>in partibus</hi>.
      Shortly after this, a papal bull, “given at St. Peter’s, Rome, under the seal of the
      fisherman,” was issued, establishing a Romish hierarchy in England. This was soon followed by
      a pastoral letter by the new cardinal “given out of the Appian Gate,” announcing that
      “Catholic England had been restored to its orbit in the ecclesiastical firmament.”</p>
     <p>The country at first was more stupefied than alarmed. It was conscious that something
      extraordinary had happened, and some great action taken by an ecclesiastical power, which from
      tradition it was ever inclined to view with suspicion and some fear. But it held its breath
      for a while. It so happened that the prime minister was a member of a great house which had
      become illustrious by its profession of Protestant principles, and even by its sufferings in a
      cause which England had once looked on as sacred. The prime minister, a man of distinguished
      ability, not devoid even of genius, was also a wily politician, and of almost unrivalled
      experience in the management of political parties. The ministry was weak and nearly worn out,
      and its chief, influenced partly by noble and historical sentiments, partly by a conviction
      that he had a fine occasion to rally the confidence of the country round himself and his
      friends, and to restore the repute of his political connection, thought fit, without
      consulting his colleagues, to publish a manifesto denouncing the aggression of the Pope upon
      our Protestantism as insolent and insidious, and as expressing a pretension of supremacy over
      the realm of England which made the minister indignant.</p>
     <p>A confused public wanted to be led, and now they were led. They sprang to their feet like an
      armed man. The corporation of London, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge had audiences
      of the Queen; the counties met, the municipalities memorialised; before the first of January
      there had been held nearly seven thousand public meetings, asserting the supremacy of the
      Queen and calling on Her Majesty’s Government to vindicate it by stringent measures.</p>
     <p>Unfortunately, it was soon discovered by the minister that there had been nothing illegal in
      the conduct of the Pope or the Cardinal, and a considerable portion of the Liberal party began
      to express the inconvenient opinion, that the manifesto of their chief was opposed to those
      principles of civil and religious liberty of which he was the hereditary champion. Some
      influential members of his own cabinet did not conceal their disapprobation of a step on which
      they had not been consulted.</p>
     <p>Immediately after Christmas, Endymion and Lady Montfort settled in London. She was anxious
      to open her new mansion as soon as parliament met, and to organise continuous receptions. She
      looked upon the ministry as in a critical state, and thought it was an occasion when social
      influences might not inconsiderably assist them.</p>
     <p>But though she exhibited for this object her wonted energy and high spirit, a fine
      observer—Mr. Sidney Wilton, for example—might have detected a change in the manner of
      Berengaria. Though the strength of her character was unaltered, there was an absence of that
      restlessness, it might be said, that somewhat feverish excitement, from which formerly she was
      not always free. The truth is, her heart was satisfied, and that brought repose. Feelings of
      affection, long mortified and pent up, were now lavished and concentrated on a husband of her
      heart and adoration, and she was proud that his success and greatness might be avowed as the
      objects of her life.</p>
     <p>The campaign, however, for which such preparations were made, ended almost before it began.
      The ministry, on the meeting of parliament, found themselves with a discontented House of
      Commons, and discordant counsels among themselves. The anti-papal manifesto was the secret
      cause of this evil state, but the prime minister, to avoid such a mortifying admission, took
      advantage of two unfavourable divisions on other matters, and resigned.</p>
     <p>Here was a crisis—another crisis! Could the untried Protectionists, without men, form an
      administration? It was whispered that Lord Derby had been sent for, and declined the attempt.
      Then there was another rumour, that he was going to try. Mr. Bertie Tremaine looked
      mysterious. The time for the third party had clearly arrived. It was known that he had the
      list of the next ministry in his breast-pocket, but it was only shown to Mr. Tremaine Bertie,
      who confided in secrecy to the initiated that it was the strongest government since “All the
      Talents.”</p>
     <p>Notwithstanding this great opportunity, “All the Talents” were not summoned. The leader of
      the Protectionists renounced the attempt in despair, and the author of the anti-papal
      manifesto was again sent for, and obliged to introduce the measure which had already destroyed
      a government and disorganised a party.</p>
     <p>“Sidney Wilton,” said Lady Montfort to her husband, “says that they are in the mud, and he
      for one will not go back—but he will go. I know him. He is too soft-hearted to stand an appeal
      from colleagues in distress. But were I you, Endymion, I would not return. I think you want a
      little rest, or you have got a great deal of private business to attend to, or something of
      that kind. Nobody notices the withdrawal of an under-secretary except those in office. There
      is no necessity why you should be in the mud. I will continue to receive, and do everything
      that is possible for our friends, but I think my husband has been an under-secretary long
      enough.”</p>
     <p>Endymion quite agreed with his wife. The minister offered him preferment and the Privy
      Council, but Lady Montfort said it was really not so important as the office he had resigned.
      She was resolved that he should not return to them, and she had her way. Ferrars himself now
      occupied a rather peculiar position, being the master of a great fortune and of an
      establishment which was the headquarters of the party of which he was now only a private
      member; but, calm and collected, he did not lose his head; always said and did the right
      thing, and never forgot his early acquaintances. Trenchard was his bosom political friend.
      Seymour Hicks, who, through Endymion’s kindness, had now got into the Treasury, and was quite
      fashionable, had the run of the House, and made himself marvellously useful, while St. Barbe,
      who had become by mistake a member of the Conservative Club, drank his frequent claret cup
      every Saturday evening at Lady Montfort’s receptions with many pledges to the welfare of the
      Liberal administration.</p>
     <p>The flag of the Tory party waved over the magnificent mansion of which Imogene Beaumaris was
      the graceful life. As parties were nearly equal, and the ministry was supposed to be in decay,
      the rival reception was as well attended as that of Berengaria. The two great leaders were
      friends, intimate, but not perhaps quite so intimate as a few years before. “Lady Montfort is
      very kind to me,” Imogene would say, “but I do not think she now quite remembers we are
      cousins.” Both Lord and Lady Waldershare seemed equally devoted to Lady Beaumaris. “I do not
      think,” he would say, “that I shall ever get Adriana to receive. It is an organic gift, and
      very rare. What I mean to do is to have a first-rate villa and give the party strawberries. I
      always say Adriana is like Nell Gwyn, and she shall go about with a pottle. One never sees a
      pottle of strawberries now. I believe they went out, like all good things, with the
      Stuarts.”</p>
     <p>And so, after all these considerable events, the season rolled on and closed tranquilly.
      Lord and Lady Hainault continued to give banquets, over which the hostess sighed; Sir Peter
      Vigo had the wisdom to retain his millions, which few manage to do, as it is admitted that it
      is easier to make a fortune than to keep one. Mrs. Rodney, supremely habited, still drove her
      ponies, looking younger and prettier than ever, and getting more fashionable every day, and
      Mr. Ferrars and Berengaria, Countess of Montfort, retired in the summer to their beautiful and
      beloved Princedown.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
     <p>Although the past life of Endymion had, on the whole, been a happy life, and although he was
      destined also to a happy future, perhaps the four years which elapsed from the time he quitted
      office, certainly in his experience had never been exceeded, and it was difficult to imagine
      could be exceeded, in felicity. He had a great interest, and even growing influence in public
      life without any of its cares; he was united to a woman whom he had long passionately loved,
      and who had every quality and a fortune which secured him all those advantages which are
      appreciated by men of taste and generosity. He became a father, and a family name which had
      been originally borne by a courtier of the elder Stuarts was now bestowed on the future lord
      of Princedown.</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort herself had no thought but her husband. His happiness, his enjoyment of
      existence, his success and power in life, entirely absorbed her. The anxiety which she felt
      that in everything he should be master was touching. Once looked upon as the most imperious of
      women, she would not give a direction on any matter without his opinion and sanction. One
      would have supposed from what might be observed under their roof, that she was some beautiful
      but portionless maiden whom Endymion had raised to wealth and power.</p>
     <p>All this time, however, Lady Montfort sedulously maintained that commanding position in
      social politics for which she was singularly fitted. Indeed, in that respect, she had no
      rival. She received the world with the same constancy and splendour, as if she were the wife
      of a minister. Animated by Waldershare, Lady Beaumaris maintained in this respect a certain
      degree of rivalry. She was the only hope and refuge of the Tories, and rich, attractive, and
      popular, her competition could not be disregarded. But Lord Beaumaris was a little freakish.
      Sometimes he would sail in his yacht to odd places, and was at Algiers or in Egypt when,
      according to Tadpole, he ought to have been at Piccadilly Terrace. Then he occasionally got
      crusty about his hunting. He would hunt, whatever were the political consequences, but whether
      he were in Africa or Leicestershire, Imogene must be with him. He could not exist without her
      constant presence. There was something in her gentleness, combined with her quick and ready
      sympathy and playfulness of mind and manner, which alike pleased and soothed his life.</p>
     <p>The Whigs tottered on for a year after the rude assault of Cardinal Penruddock, but they
      were doomed, and the Protectionists were called upon to form an administration. As they had no
      one in their ranks who had ever been in office except their chief, who was in the House of
      Lords, the affair seemed impossible. The attempt, however, could not be avoided. A dozen men,
      without the slightest experience of official life, had to be sworn in as privy councillors,
      before even they could receive the seals and insignia of their intended offices. On their
      knees, according to the constitutional custom, a dozen men, all in the act of genuflexion at
      the same moment, and headed, too, by one of the most powerful peers in the country, the Lord
      of Alnwick Castle himself, humbled themselves before a female Sovereign, who looked serene and
      imperturbable before a spectacle never seen before, and which, in all probability, will never
      be seen again.</p>
     <p>One of this band, a gentleman without any official experience whatever, was not only placed
      in the cabinet, but was absolutely required to become the leader of the House of Commons,
      which had never occurred before, except in the instance of Mr. Pitt in 1782. It has been said
      that it was unwise in the Protectionists assuming office when, on this occasion and on
      subsequent ones, they were far from being certain of a majority in the House of Commons. It
      should, however, be remembered, that unless they had dared these ventures, they never could
      have formed a body of men competent, from their official experience and their practice in
      debate, to form a ministry. The result has rather proved that they were right. Had they
      continued to refrain from incurring responsibility, they must have broken up and merged in
      different connections, which, for a party numerically so strong as the Protectionists, would
      have been a sorry business, and probably have led to disastrous results.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bertie Tremaine having been requested to call on the Protectionist prime minister,
      accordingly repaired to headquarters with the list of his colleagues in his pocket. He was
      offered for himself a post of little real importance, but which secured to him the dignity of
      the privy council. Mr. Tremaine Bertie and several of his friends had assembled at his house,
      awaiting with anxiety his return. He had to communicate to them that he had been offered a
      privy councillor’s post, and to break to them that it was not proposed to provide for any
      other member of his party. Their indignation was extreme; but they naturally supposed that he
      had rejected the offer to himself with becoming scorn. Their leader, however, informed them
      that he had not felt it his duty to be so peremptory. They should remember that the
      recognition of their political status by such an offer to their chief was a considerable
      event. For his part, he had for some time been painfully aware that the influence of the House
      of Commons in the constitutional scheme was fast waning, and that the plan of Sir William
      Temple for the reorganisation of the privy council, and depositing in it the real authority of
      the State, was that to which we should be obliged to have recourse. This offer to him of a
      seat in the council was, perhaps, the beginning of the end. It was a crisis; they must look to
      seats in the privy council, which, under Sir William Temple’s plan, would be accompanied with
      ministerial duties and salaries. What they had all, at one time, wished, had not exactly been
      accomplished, but he had felt it his duty to his friends not to shrink from responsibility. So
      he had accepted the minister’s offer.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bertie Tremaine was not long in the busy enjoyment of his easy post. Then the country
      was governed for two years by all its ablest men, who, by the end of that term, had succeeded,
      by their coalesced genius, in reducing that country to a state of desolation and despair. “I
      did not think it would have lasted even so long,” said Lady Montfort; “but then I was
      acquainted with their mutual hatreds and their characteristic weaknesses. What is to happen
      now? Somebody must be found of commanding private character and position, and with as little
      damaged a public one as in this wreck of reputations is possible. I see nobody but Sidney
      Wilton. Everybody likes him, and he is the only man who could bring people together.”</p>
     <p>And everybody seemed to be saying the same thing at the same time. The name of Sidney Wilton
      was in everybody’s mouth. It was unfortunate that he had been a member of a defunct ministry,
      but then it had always been understood that he had always disapproved of all their measures.
      There was not the slightest evidence of this, but everybody chose to believe it.</p>
     <p>Sidney Wilton was chagrined with life, and had become a martyr to the gout, which that
      chagrin had aggravated; but he was a great gentleman, and too chivalric to refuse a royal
      command when the Sovereign was in distress. Sidney Wilton became Premier, and the first
      colleague he recommended to fill the most important post after his own, the Secretaryship of
      State for Foreign Affairs, was Mr. Ferrars.</p>
     <p>“It ought to last ten years,” said Lady Montfort. “I see no danger except his health. I
      never knew a man so changed. At his time of life five years ought to make no difference in a
      man. I cannot believe he is the person who used to give us those charming parties at Gaydene.
      Whatever you may say, Endymion, I feel convinced that something must have passed between your
      sister and him. Neither of them ever gave me a hint of such a matter, or of the possibility of
      its ever happening, but feminine instinct assures me that something took place. He always had
      the gout, and his ancestors have had the gout for a couple of centuries; and all prime
      ministers have the gout. I dare say you will not escape, darling, but I hope it will never
      make you look as if you had just lost paradise, or, what would be worst, become the last
      man.”</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort was right. The ministry was strong and it was popular. There were no
      jealousies in it; every member was devoted to his chief, and felt that he was rightly the
      chief, whereas, as Lady Montfort said, the Whigs never had a ministry before in which there
      were not at least a couple of men who had been prime ministers, and as many more who thought
      they ought to be.</p>
     <p>There were years of war, and of vast and critical negotiations. Ferrars was equal to the
      duties, for he had much experience, and more thought, and he was greatly aided by the
      knowledge of affairs, and the clear and tranquil judgment of the chief minister. There was
      only one subject on which there was not between them that complete and cordial unanimity which
      was so agreeable and satisfactory. And even in this case, there was no difference of opinion,
      but rather of sentiment and feeling. It was when Prince Florestan expressed his desire to join
      the grand alliance, and become our active military ally. It was perhaps impossible, under any
      circumstances, for the Powers to refuse such an offer, but Endymion was strongly in favour of
      accepting it. It consolidated our interests in a part of Europe where we required sympathy and
      support, and it secured for us the aid and influence of the great Liberal party of the
      continent as distinguished from the secret societies and the socialist republicans. The Count
      of Ferroll, also, whose opinion weighed much with Her Majesty’s Government, was decidedly in
      favour of the combination. The English prime minister listened to their representations
      frigidly; it was difficult to refute the arguments which were adverse to his own feelings, and
      to resist the unanimous opinion not only of his colleagues, but of our allies. But he was cold
      and silent, or made discouraging remarks.</p>
     <p>“Can you trust him?” he would say. “Remember he himself has been, and still is, a member of
      the very secret societies whose baneful influence we are now told he will neutralise or
      subdue. Whatever the cabinet decides, and I fear that with this strong expression of opinion
      on the part of our allies we have little option left, remember I gave you my warning. I know
      the gentleman, and I do not trust him.”</p>
     <p>After this, the prime minister had a most severe attack of the gout, remained for weeks at
      Gaydene, and saw no one on business except Endymion and Baron Sergius.</p>
     <p>While the time is elapsing which can alone decide whether the distrust of Mr. Wilton were
      well-founded or the reverse, let us see how the world is treating the rest of our friends.</p>
     <p>Lord Waldershare did not make such a pattern husband as Endymion, but he made a much better
      one than the world ever supposed he would. Had he married Berengaria, the failure would have
      been great; but he was united to a being capable of deep affection and very sensitive, yet
      grateful for kindness from a husband to a degree not easily imaginable. And Waldershare had
      really a good heart, though a bad temper, and he was a gentleman. Besides, he had a great
      admiration and some awe of his father-in-law, and Lord Hainault, with his good-natured irony,
      and consummate knowledge of men and things, quite controlled him. With Lady Hainault he was a
      favourite. He invented plausible theories and brilliant paradoxes for her, which left her
      always in a state of charmed wonder, and when she met him again, and adopted or refuted them,
      for her intellectual power was considerable, he furnished her with fresh dogmas and tenets,
      which immediately interested her intelligence, though she generally forgot to observe that
      they were contrary to the views and principles of the last visit. Between Adriana and Imogene
      there was a close alliance, and Lady Beaumaris did everything in her power to develop Lady
      Waldershare advantageously before her husband; and so, not forgetting that Waldershare, with
      his romance, and imagination, and fancy, and taste, and caprice, had a considerable element of
      worldliness in his character, and that he liked to feel that, from living in lodgings, he had
      become a Monte Cristo, his union with Adriana may be said to be a happy and successful
      one.</p>
     <p>The friendship between Sir Peter Vigo and his brother M.P., Mr. Rodney, never diminished,
      and Mr. Rodney became richer every year. He experienced considerable remorse at sitting in
      opposition to the son of his right honourable friend, the late William Pitt Ferrars, and
      frequently consulted Sir Peter on his embarrassment and difficulty. Sir Peter, who never
      declined arranging any difficulty, told his friend to be easy, and that he, Sir Peter, saw his
      way. It became gradually understood, that if ever the government was in difficulties, Mr.
      Rodney’s vote might be counted on. He was peculiarly situated, for, in a certain sense, his
      friend the Right Honourable William Pitt Ferrars had entrusted the guardianship of his child
      to his care. But whenever the ministry was not in danger, the ministry must not depend upon
      his vote.</p>
     <p>Trenchard had become Secretary of the Treasury in the Wilton administration, had established
      his reputation, and was looked upon as a future minister. Jawett, without forfeiting his post
      and promotion at Somerset House, had become the editor of a new periodical magazine, called
      the “Privy Council.” It was established and maintained by Mr. Bertie Tremaine, and was chiefly
      written by that gentleman himself. It was full of Greek quotations, to show that it was not
      Grub Street, and written in a style as like that of Sir William Temple, as a paper in
      “Rejected Addresses” might resemble the classic lucubrations of the statesman-sage who, it is
      hoped, will be always remembered by a grateful country for having introduced into these
      islands the Moor Park apricot. What the pages of the “Privy Council” meant no human being had
      the slightest conception except Mr. Tremaine Bertie.</p>
     <p>Mr. Thornberry remained a respected member of the cabinet. It was thought his presence there
      secured the sympathies of advanced Liberalism throughout the country; but that was a tradition
      rather than a fact. Statesmen in high places are not always so well acquainted with the
      changes and gradations of opinion in political parties at home as they are with those abroad.
      We hardly mark the growth of the tree we see every day. Mr. Thornberry had long ceased to be
      popular with his former friends, and the fact that he had become a minister was one of the
      causes of this change of feeling. That was unreasonable, but in politics unreasonable
      circumstances are elements of the problem to be solved. It was generally understood that, on
      the next election, Mr. Thornberry would have to look out for another seat; his chief
      constituents, those who are locally styled the leaders of the party, were still faithful to
      him, for they were proud of having a cabinet minister for their member, to be presented by him
      at court, and occasionally to dine with him; but the “masses,” who do not go to court, and are
      never asked to dinner, required a member who would represent their whims, and it was quite
      understood that, on the very first occasion, this enlightened community had resolved to send
      up to Westminster—Mr. Enoch Craggs.</p>
     <p>It is difficult to say, whether in his private life Job found affairs altogether more
      satisfactory than in his public. His wife had joined the Roman Communion. An ingrained
      perverseness which prevented his son from ever willingly following the advice or example of
      his parents, had preserved John Hampden in the Anglican faith, but he had portraits of Laud
      and Strafford over his mantelpiece, and embossed in golden letters on a purple ground the
      magical word “THOROUGH.” His library chiefly consisted of the “Tracts for the Times,” and a
      colossal edition of the Fathers gorgeously bound. He was a very clever fellow, this young
      Thornberry, a natural orator, and was leader of the High Church party in the Oxford Union. He
      brought home his friends occasionally to Hurstley, and Job had the opportunity of becoming
      acquainted with a class and school of humanity—with which, notwithstanding his considerable
      experience of life, he had no previous knowledge—young gentlemen, apparently half-starved and
      dressed like priests, and sometimes an enthusiastic young noble, in much better physical
      condition, and in costume becoming a cavalier, ready to raise the royal standard at Edgehill.
      What a little annoyed Job was that his son always addressed him as “Squire,” a habit even
      pedantically followed by his companions. He was, however, justly entitled to this ancient and
      reputable honour, for Job had been persuaded to purchase Hurstley, was a lord of several
      thousand acres, and had the boar’s head carried in procession at Christmas in his ancient
      hall. It is strange, but he was rather perplexed than annoyed by all these marvellous
      metamorphoses in his life and family. His intelligence was as clear as ever, and his views on
      all subjects unchanged; but he was, like many other men, governed at home by his affections.
      He preferred the new arrangement, if his wife and family were happy and contented, to a
      domestic system founded on his own principles, accompanied by a sullen or shrewish partner of
      his own life and rebellious offspring.</p>
     <p>What really vexed him, among comparatively lesser matters, was the extraordinary passion
      which in time his son exhibited for game-preserving. He did at last interfere on this matter,
      but in vain. John Hampden announced that he did not value land if he was only to look at it,
      and that sport was the patriotic pastime of an English gentleman. “You used in old days never
      to be satisfied with what I got out of the land,” said the old grandfather to Job, with a
      little amiable malice; “there is enough, at any rate now for the hares and rabbits, but I
      doubt for anybody else.”</p>
     <p>We must not forget our old friend St. Barbe. Whether he had written himself out or had
      become lazy in the luxurious life in which he now indulged, he rarely appealed to the literary
      public, which still admired him. He was, by way of intimating that he was engaged in a great
      work, which, though written in his taking prose, was to be really the epogee of social life in
      this country. Dining out every day, and ever arriving, however late, at those “small and
      earlies,” which he once despised; he gave to his friends frequent intimations that he was not
      there for pleasure, but rather following his profession; he was in his studio, observing and
      reflecting on all the passions and manners of mankind, and gathering materials for the great
      work which was eventually to enchant and instruct society, and immortalise his name.</p>
     <p>“The fact is, I wrote too early,” he would say. “I blush when I read my own books, though
      compared with those of the brethren, they might still be looked on as classics. They say no
      artist can draw a camel, and I say no author ever drew a gentleman. How can they, with no
      opportunity of ever seeing one? And so with a little caricature of manners, which they catch
      second-hand, they are obliged to have recourse to outrageous nonsense, as if polished life
      consisted only of bigamists, and that ladies of fashion were in the habit of paying black mail
      to returned convicts. However, I shall put an end to all this. I have now got the materials,
      or am accumulating them daily. You hint that I give myself up too much to society. You are
      talking of things you do not understand. A dinner party is a chapter. I catch the Cynthia of
      the minute, sir, at a <hi>soiree</hi>. If I only served a grateful country, I should be in the
      proudest position of any of its sons; if I had been born in any country but this, I should
      have been decorated, and perhaps made secretary of state like Addison, who did not write as
      well as I do, though his style somewhat resembles mine.”</p>
     <p>Notwithstanding these great plans, it came in time to Endymion’s ear, that poor St. Barbe
      was in terrible straits. Endymion delicately helped him and then obtained for him a pension,
      and not an inconsiderable one. Relieved from anxiety, St. Barbe resumed his ancient and
      natural vein. He passed his days in decrying his friend and patron, and comparing his
      miserable pension with the salary of a secretary of state, who, so far as his experience went,
      was generally a second-rate man. Endymion, though he knew St. Barbe was always decrying him,
      only smiled, and looked upon it all as the necessary consequence of his organisation, which
      involved a singular combination of vanity and envy in the highest degree. St. Barbe was not
      less a guest in Carlton Terrace than heretofore, and was even kindly invited to Princedown to
      profit by the distant sea-breeze. Lady Montfort, whose ears some of his pranks had reached,
      was not so tolerant as her husband. She gave him one day her views of his conduct. St. Barbe
      was always a little afraid of her, and on this occasion entirely lost himself; vented the most
      solemn affirmations that there was not a grain of truth in these charges; that he was the
      victim, as he had been all his life, of slander and calumny—the sheer creatures of envy, and
      then began to fawn upon his hostess, and declared that he had ever thought there was something
      godlike in the character of her husband.</p>
     <p>“And what is there in yours, Mr. St. Barbe?” asked Lady Montfort.</p>
     <p>The ministry had lasted several years; its foreign policy had been successful; it had
      triumphed in war and secured peace. The military conduct of the troops of King Florestan had
      contributed to these results, and the popularity of that sovereign in England was for a
      foreigner unexampled. During this agitated interval, Endymion and Myra had met more than once
      through the providential medium of those favoured spots of nature—German baths.</p>
     <p>There had arisen a public feeling, that the ally who had served us so well should be invited
      to visit again a country wherein he had so long sojourned, and where he was so much
      appreciated. The only evidence that the Prime Minister gave that he was conscious of this
      feeling was an attack of gout. Endymion himself, though in a difficult and rather painful
      position in this matter, did everything to shield and protect his chief, but the general
      sentiment became so strong, sanctioned too, as it was understood, in the highest quarter, that
      it could no longer be passed by unnoticed; and, in due time, to the great delight and
      satisfaction of the nation, an impending visit from our faithful ally King Florestan and his
      beautiful wife, Queen Myra, was authoritatively announced.</p>
     <p>Every preparation was made to show them honour. They were the guests of our Sovereign; but
      from the palace which they were to inhabit, to the humblest tenement in the meanest back
      street, there was only one feeling of gratitude, and regard, and admiration. The English
      people are the most enthusiastic people in the world; there are other populations which are
      more excitable, but there is no nation, when it feels, where the sentiment is so profound and
      irresistible.</p>
     <p>The hour arrived. The season and the weather were favourable. From the port where they
      landed to their arrival at the metropolis, the whole country seemed poured out into the open
      air; triumphal arches, a way of flags and banners, and bits of bunting on every hovel. The
      King and Queen were received at the metropolitan station by Princes of the blood, and
      accompanied to the palace, where the great officers of state and the assembled ministry were
      gathered together to do them honour. A great strain was thrown upon Endymion throughout these
      proceedings, as the Prime Minister, who had been suffering the whole season, and rarely
      present in his seat in parliament, was, at this moment, in his worst paroxysm. He could not
      therefore be present at the series of balls and banquets, and brilliant public functions,
      which greeted the royal guests. Their visit to the City, when they dined with the Lord Mayor,
      and to which they drove in royal carriages through a sea of population tumultuous with
      devotion, was the most gratifying of all these splendid receptions, partly from the
      associations of mysterious power and magnificence connected with the title and character of
      LORD MAYOR. The Duke of St. Angelo, the Marquis of Vallombrosa, and the Prince of Montserrat,
      quite lost their presence of mind. Even the Princess of Montserrat, with more quarterings on
      her own side than any house in Europe, confessed that she trembled when Her Serene Highness
      courtesied before the Lady Mayoress. Perhaps, however, the most brilliant, the most fanciful,
      infinitely the most costly entertainment that was given on this memorable occasion, was the
      festival at Hainault. The whole route from town to the forest was lined with thousands,
      perhaps hundreds of thousands, of spectators; a thousand guests were received at the banquet,
      and twelve palaces were raised by that true magician, Mr. Benjamin Edgington, in the park, for
      the countless visitors in the evening. At night the forest was illuminated. Everybody was glad
      except Lady Hainault, who sighed, and said, “I have no doubt the Queen would have preferred
      her own room, and that we should have had a quiet dinner, as in old days, in the little
      Venetian parlour.”</p>
     <p>When Endymion returned home at night, he found a summons to Gaydene; the Prime Minister
      being, it was feared, in a dangerous state.</p>
     <p>The next day, late in the afternoon, there was a rumour that the Prime Minister had
      resigned. Then it was authoritatively contradicted, and then at night another rumour rose that
      the minister had resigned, but that the resignation would not be accepted until after the
      termination of the royal visit. The King and Queen had yet to remain a short week.</p>
     <p>The fact is, the resignation had taken place, but it was known only to those who then could
      not have imparted the intelligence. The public often conjectures the truth, though it clothes
      its impression or information in the vague shape of a rumour. In four-and-twenty hours the
      great fact was authoritatively announced in all the journals, with leading articles
      speculating on the successor to the able and accomplished minister of whose services the
      Sovereign and the country were so unhappily deprived. Would his successor be found in his own
      cabinet? And then several names were mentioned; Rawchester, to Lady Montfort’s disgust.
      Rawchester was a safe man, and had had much experience, which, as with most safe men, probably
      left him as wise and able as before he imbibed it. Would there be altogether a change of
      parties? Would the Protectionists try again? They were very strong, but always in a minority,
      like some great continental powers, who have the finest army in the world, and yet get always
      beaten. Would that band of self-admiring geniuses, who had upset every cabinet with whom they
      were ever connected, return on the shoulders of the people, as they always dreamed, though
      they were always the persons of whom the people never seemed to think?</p>
     <p>Lady Montfort was in a state of passive excitement. She was quite pale, and she remained
      quite pale for hours. She would see no one. She sat in Endymion’s room, and never spoke, while
      he continued writing and transacting his affairs. She thought she was reading the “Morning
      Post,” but really could not distinguish the advertisements from leading articles.</p>
     <p>There was a knock at the library door, and the groom of the chambers brought in a note for
      Endymion. He glanced at the handwriting of the address, and then opened it, as pale as his
      wife. Then he read it again, and then he gave it to her. She threw her eyes over it, and then
      her arms around his neck.</p>
     <p>“Order my brougham at three o’clock.”</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXXIII</head>
     <head>Endymion was with his sister.</head>
     <p>“How dear of you to come to me,” she said, “when you cannot have a moment to yourself.”</p>
     <p>“Well, you know,” he replied, “it is not like forming a government. That is an affair. I
      have reason to think all my colleagues will remain with me. I shall summon them for this
      afternoon, and if we agree, affairs will go on as before. I should like to get down to Gaydene
      to-night.”</p>
     <p>“To-night!” said the queen musingly. “We have only one day left, and I wanted you to do
      something for me.”</p>
     <p>“It shall be done, if possible; I need not say that.”</p>
     <p>“It is not difficult to do, if we have time—if we have to-morrow morning, and early. But if
      you go to Gaydene you will hardly return to-night, and I shall lose my chance,—and yet it is
      to me a business most precious.”</p>
     <p>“It shall be managed; tell me then.”</p>
     <p>“I learnt that Hill Street is not occupied at this moment. I want to visit the old house
      with you, before I leave England, probably for ever. I have only got the early morn to-morrow,
      but with a veil and your brougham, I think we might depart unobserved, before the crowd begins
      to assemble. Do you think you could be here at nine o’clock?”</p>
     <p>So it was settled, and being hurried, he departed.</p>
     <p>And next morning he was at the palace before nine o’clock; and the queen, veiled, entered
      his brougham. There were already some loiterers, but the brother and sister passed through the
      gates unobserved.</p>
     <p>They reached Hill Street. The queen visited all the principal rooms, and made many remarks
      appropriate to many memories. “But,” she said, “it was not to see these rooms I came, though I
      was glad to do so, and the corridor on the second story whence I called out to you when you
      returned, and for ever, from Eton, and told you there was bad news. What I came for was to see
      our old nursery, where we lived so long together, and so fondly! Here it is; here we are. All
      I have desired, all I have dreamed, have come to pass. Darling, beloved of my soul, by all our
      sorrows, by all our joys, in this scene of our childhood and bygone days, let me give you my
      last embrace.”</p>
