  <head>CHAPTER I. THE LADY ISABEL.</head>
  <p><hi>In</hi> an easy-chair of the spacious and handsome
          library of his town-house, sat William, Earl of
          Mount Severn. His hair was grey, the smoothness of
          his expansive brow was defaced by premature
          wrinkles, and his once attractive face bore the
          pale, unmistakable look of dissipation. One of his
          feet was cased in folds of linen, as it rested on a
          soft velvet ottoman, speaking of gout as plainly as
          any foot ever spoke yet. It would seem—to look at
          the man as he sat there—that he had grown old before
          his time. And so he had. His years were barely
          nine-and-forty; yet in all, save years, he was an
          aged man.</p>
  <p>A noted character had been he, Earl of Mount Severn. Not
          that he had been a renowned politician, or a great
          general, or an eminent statesman, or even an active
          member of the Upper House: not for any of these had
          the earl's name been in the mouths of men. But for
          the most reckless among the reckless, for the
          spendthrift among spendthrifts, for the gamester
          above all gamesters, and for a gay man outstripping
          the gay; by these characteristics did the world know
          Lord Mount Severn <pb/> It was said his faults were
          those of the head; that a better heart or more
          generous spirit never beat in human form; and there
          was much of truth in this. It had been well for him
          had he lived and died plain William Vane. Up to his
          five-and-twentieth year he had been industrious and
          steady, had kept his terms in the Temple, and
          studied late and early. The sober application of
          William Vane had been a byword with the embryo
          barristers around; Judge Vane, they ironically
          called him, and they strove ineffectually to allure
          him away to idleness and pleasure. But young Vane
          was ambitious, and he knew that on his own talents
          and exertions must depend his rising in the world.
          He was poor, of excellent family, but counting a
          relative in the old Earl of Mount Severn. The
          possibility of his succeeding to the earldom never
          occurred to him, for three healthy lives, two of
          them young, stood between him and the title. Yet
          those lives died off; one of apoplexy, one of fever
          in Africa, the third boating at Oxford; and the
          young Temple student, William Vane, suddenly found
          himself Earl of Mount Severn, and the lawful
          possessor of sixty thousand pounds a year.</p>
  <p>His first idea was, that he should never know how to
          spend his money: that such a sum, year by year,
          could <hi>not</hi> be spent. It was a wonder his
          head was not turned by adulation at the onset; he
          was courted, flattered, and caressed by all classes.
          He became the most attractive man of his day; for,
          independent of his newly acquired wealth and title,
          he was of distinguished appearance and fascinating
          manners. Unfortunately, the prudence which had
          sustained William Vane, the poor-law student, in his
          solitary Temple chambers, entirely forsook William
          Vane, the young Earl of Mount Severn, and he
          commenced <pb/> his career at a speed so great, that
          all staid people said he was going to ruin and the
          deuce headlong.</p>
  <p>But a peer of the realm, and one whose rent-roll is sixty
          thousand per annum, does not go to ruin in a day.
          There sat the earl in his library now, in his
          nine-and-fortieth year, and ruin had not come
          yet—that is, it had not overwhelmed him. But the
          embarrassments which had clung to him, and been the
          destruction of his tranquillity, the bane of his
          existence, who shall describe them? The public knew
          them pretty well, his private friends better, his
          creditors best; but none, save himself, knew, or
          could ever know, the worrying torment that was his
          portion; well-nigh driving him to distraction. Years
          ago, by dint of looking things steadily in the face,
          and by economising, he might have retrieved his
          position; but he had done what most people will do
          in such cases—put off the evil day <hi>sine die</hi>
          , and gone on increasing his enormous list of debts.
          The hour of exposure and ruin was now advancing
          fast.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the earl himself was thinking so, as he sat there
          before an ominous mass of papers which strewed the
          library table. His thoughts were back in the past.
          That was a foolish marriage of his, that Gretna
          Green match for love, foolish so far as prudence
          went; but the countess had been an affectionate wife
          to him, had borne with his follies and his neglect,
          and been an admirable mother to their only child.
          One child alone had been theirs, and in her
          thirteenth year the countess had died. If they had
          but been blessed with a son—the earl groaned over
          the long-continued disappointment still— he might
          then have seen a way out of his difficulties. <pb/>
          The boy, as soon as he was of age, would have joined
          with him in cutting off the entail, and—</p>
  <p>"My lord," said a servant, entering the room and
          interrupting the earl's castles in the air, "a
          gentleman is asking to see you."</p>
  <p>"Who?" cried the earl, sharply, not perceiving the card
          the man was bringing. No unknown person, although
          wearing the externals of a foreign ambassador, was
          ever admitted unceremoniously to the presence of
          Lord Mount Severn. Years of duns had taught the
          servants caution.</p>
  <p>"His card is here, my lord. It is Mr. Carlyle of West
          Lynne."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle of West Lynne," groaned the earl, whose foot
          just then had an awful twinge, "what does he want?
          Show him up."</p>
  <p>The servant did as he was bid, and introduced Mr.
          Carlyle. He was a very tall man of seven-and-twenty,
          of remarkably noble presence. He was somewhat given
          to stooping his head when he spoke to any one
          shorter than himself; it was a peculiar habit,
          almost to be called a bowing habit, and his father
          had possessed it before him: when told of it, he
          would laugh, and say he was unconscious of doing it.
          His features were good, his complexion was pale and
          clear, his hair dark, and his full eye-lids drooped
          over his deep grey eyes. Altogether it was a
          countenance that both men and women liked to look
          upon, the index of an honourable, sincere nature;
          not that it would have been called a handsome face,
          so much as a pleasing and distinguished one. Though
          but the son of a country lawyer, and destined to be
          a lawyer himself, he had received the training of a
          gentleman, had been educated at Rugby, <pb/> and
          taken his degree at Oxford. He advanced at once to
          the earl in the straightforward way of a man who has
          come on business.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle," said the latter, holding out his had —he
          was always deemed the most affable peer of the
          age—"I am happy to see you. You perceive I cannot
          rise; at least without great pain and inconvenience:
          my enemy, the gout, has possession of me again. Take
          a seat. Are you staying in town?"</p>
  <p>"I have just arrived from West Lynne. The chief object of
          my journey was to see your lordship."</p>
  <p>"What can I do for you?" asked the earl, uneasily, for a
          suspicion now crossed his mind that Mr. Carlyle
          might be acting for some one of his many troublesome
          creditors.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle drew his chair nearer to the earl, and spoke
          in a low tone:</p>
  <p>"A rumour came to my ears, my lord, that East Lynne was
          in the market."</p>
  <p>"A moment, sir," exclaimed the earl, with reserve, not to
          say hauteur, in his tone, for his suspicions were
          gaining ground; "are we to converse confidentially
          together, as men of honour, or is there something
          concealed behind?"</p>
  <p>"I do not understand you," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"In a word—excuse my speaking plainly, but I must feel my
          ground—are you here on the part of some of my
          rascally creditors, to pump information out of me
          that otherwise they would not get?"</p>
  <p>"My lord!" said the visitor, "I know that a lawyer gets
          credit for possessing but lax notions on the score
          of honour, but you can scarcely suspect I should be
          guilty of underhand work towards you. I never was
          <pb/> guilty of a mean trick in my life, to my
          recollection, and I do not think I ever shall
          be."</p>
  <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Carlyle. If you knew half the tricks and
            <hi>ruses</hi> played upon me, you would not
          wonder at my suspecting all the world. Proceed with
          your business."</p>
  <p>"I heard that East Lynne was for private sale: your agent
          dropped half a word to me in confidence. If so, I
          should wish to be the purchaser."</p>
  <p>"For whom?" inquired the earl.</p>
  <p>"Myself."</p>
  <p>"You!" laughed the earl. "Egad! lawyering can't be such
          bad work, Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Nor is it," rejoined Mr. Carlyle, "with an extensive
          first-class connexion, such as ours. But you must
          remember that a good fortune was left me by my
          uncle, and a large one by my father."</p>
  <p>"I know. The proceeds of lawyering also."</p>
  <p>"Not altogether. My mother brought a fortune on her
          marriage, and it enabled my father to speculate
          successfully. I have been looking out for an
          eligible property to invest my money upon, and East
          Lynne will suit me well, provided I can have the
          refusal of it, and we can agree about terms."</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn mused for a few moments before he
          spoke. "Mr. Carlyle," he began, "my affairs are very
          bad, and ready money I must find somewhere. Now East
          Lynne is not entailed; neither is it mortgaged to
          anything like its value, though the latter fact, as
          you may imagine, is not patent to the world. When I
          bought it a bargain, eighteen years ago, you were
          the lawyer on the other side, I remember."</p>
  <pb/>
  <p>"My father," smiled Mr. Carlyle. "I was a child at the
          time."</p>
  <p>"Of course: I ought to have said your father. By selling
          East Lynne, a few thousands will come into my hands,
          after claims on it are settled; I have no other
          means of raising the wind, and that is why I have
          resolved to part with it. But now, understand: if it
          were known abroad that East Lynne is going from me,
          I should have a hornet's nest about my ears: so that
          it must be disposed of <hi>privately</hi> . Do you
          comprehend?"</p>
  <p>"Perfectly," replied Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I would as soon you bought it as anyone else, if, as you
          say, we can agree about terms."</p>
  <p>"What does your lordship expect for it—at a rough
          estimate?"</p>
  <p>"For particulars I must refer you to my men of business,
          Warburton and Ware. Not less than seventy thousand
          pounds."</p>
  <p>"Too much, my lord," cried Mr. Carlyle, decisively.</p>
  <p>"And that's not its value," returned the earl.</p>
  <p>"These forced sales never do fetch their value," answered
          the plain-speaking lawyer. "I had thought, until
          this hint was given me by Beauchamp, that East Lynne
          was settled on your lordship's daughter."</p>
  <p>"There's nothing settled on her," rejoined the earl, the
          contraction on his brow standing out more plainly.
          "That comes of your thoughtless, runaway marriages.
          I fell in love with General Conway's daughter, and
          she ran away with me, like a fool: that is, we were
          both fools together for our pains. The general
          objected to me; and said I must sow my wild oats
          before he would give me Mary: so I took her to
          Gretna Green, and she became Countess of Mount
          Severn, without a settlement. <pb/> It was an
          unfortunate affair, taking one thing with another.
          When her elopement was made known to the general, it
          killed him."</p>
  <p>"Killed him!" interrupted Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It did. He had disease of the heart, and the excitement
          brought on the crisis. My poor wife never was happy
          from that hour: she blamed herself for her father's
          death; and I believe it led to her own. She was ill
          for years: the doctors called it consumption; but it
          was more like a wasting insensibly away, and
          consumption never had been in her family. No luck
          ever attends runaway marriages: I have noticed it
          since, in many, many instances: something bad is
          sure to turn up from it."</p>
  <p>"There might have been a settlement executed after the
          marriage," observed Mr. Carlyle, for the earl had
          stopped, and seemed lost in thought.</p>
  <p>"I know there might: but there was not. My wife had
          possessed no fortune; I was already deep in my
          career of extravagance; and neither of us thought of
          making provision for our future children: or, if we
          thought of it, we did not do it. There is an old
          saying, Mr. Carlyle, that what may be done at any
          time, is never done."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle bowed.</p>
  <p>"So my child is portionless," resumed the earl, with a
          suppressed sigh. "The thought, that it may be an
          embarrassing thing for her, were I to die before she
          is settled in life, crosses my mind when I am in a
          serious mood. That she will marry well, there is
          little doubt, for she possesses beauty in a rare
          degree, and has been reared as an English girl
          should be, not to frivolity and foppery. She was
          trained by her mother, who (save for <pb/> the mad
          act she was persuaded into by me) was all goodness
          and refinement, for the first twelve years of her
          life, and, since then, by an admirable governess. No
          fear that she will be decamping to Gretna
          Green."</p>
  <p>"She was a very lovely child," observed the lawyer. "I
          remember that."</p>
  <p>"Ay; you have seen her at East Lynne, in her mother's
          lifetime. But, to return to business. If you become
          the purchaser of the East Lynne estate, Mr. Carlyle,
          it must be under the rose. The money that it brings,
          after paying off the mortgage, I must have, as I
          tell you, for my private use; and you know I should
          not be able to touch a farthing of it, if the
          confounded public got an inkling of the transfer. In
          the eyes of the world, the proprietor of East Lynne
          must still be Lord Mount Severn—at least for some
          little time afterwards. Perhaps you will not object
          to that."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle considered before replying: and then the
          conversation was resumed, when it was decided that
          he should see Warburton and Ware the first thing in
          the morning, and confer with them. It was growing
          late when he rose to leave.</p>
  <p>"Stay and dine with me," said the earl.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle hesitated, and looked down at his dress:
          plain, gentlemanly morning attire, but certainly not
          dinner costume for a peer's table.</p>
  <p>"Oh, that's nothing," said the earl; "we shall be quite
          alone, except my daughter. Mrs. Vane of Castle
          Marling is staying with us; she came up to present
          my child at the last Drawing-room, but I think I
          heard something about her dining out to-day. If not,
          we will have it by ourselves here. Oblige me by
          touching the bell, Mr. Carlyle, and set the trouble
          down to the score of my unfortunate foot."</p>
  <pb n="10"/>
  <p>The servant entered.</p>
  <p>"Inquire whether Mrs. Vane dines at home," said the
          earl.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Vane dines out, my lord," was the man's immediate
          reply. "The carriage is at the door now, waiting to
          take her."</p>
  <p>"Very well. Mr. Carlyle remains."</p>
  <p>At seven o'clock the dinner was announced, and the earl
          was wheeled into the adjoining room. As he and Mr.
          Carlyle entered it at one door, some one else came
          in by the opposite one. Who—what—was it? Mr. Carlyle
          looked, not quite sure whether it was a human being:
          he almost thought it more like an angel.</p>
  <p>A light, graceful, girlish form, a face of surpassing
          beauty, beauty that is rarely seen, save from the
          imagination of a painter, dark shining curls falling
          on her neck and shoulders smooth as a child's, fair
          delicate arms decorated with pearls, and a flowing
          dress of costly white lace. Altogether, the vision
          did indeed look to the lawyer as one from a fairer
          world than this.</p>
  <p>"My daughter, Mr. Carlyle; the Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>They took their seats at the table. Lord Mount Severn at
          its head, in spite of his gout and his footstool,
          and the young lady and Mr. Carlyle opposite each
          other. Mr. Carlyle had not deemed himself a
          particular admirer of woman's beauty, but the
          extraordinary loveliness of the young girl before
          him nearly took away his senses and his
          self-possession. It was not so much the perfect
          contour of the exquisite features that struck him,
          or the rich damask of the delicate cheek, or the
          luxuriant falling hair; no, it was the sweet
          expression of the soft dark eyes. Never in his life
          had he seen eyes so pleasing. He could not keep his
          gaze from <pb n="11"/> her, and he became conscious,
          as he grew more familiar with her face, that there
          was in its character a sad, sorrowful look; only at
          times was it to be noticed, when the features were
          in repose, and it lay chiefly in the very eyes he
          was admiring. Never does this unconsciously mournful
          expression exist, but it is a sure index of sorrow
          and suffering: but Mr. Carlyle understood it not.
          And who could connect sorrow with the anticipated
          brilliant future of Isabel Vane?</p>
  <p>"Isabel," observed the earl, "you are dressed."</p>
  <p>"Yes, papa. Not to keep old Mrs. Levison waiting tea. She
          likes to take it early, and I know Mrs. Vane must
          have kept her waiting dinner. It was past six when
          she drove from here."</p>
  <p>"I hope you will not be late to-night, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"It depends upon Mrs. Vane."</p>
  <p>"Then I am sure you will be. When the young ladies, in
          this fashionable world of ours, turn night into day,
          it is a bad thing for their roses. What say you, Mr.
          Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced at the roses on the cheeks opposite
          to him: they looked too fresh and bright to fade
          lightly.</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of dinner, a maid entered the room with
          a white cashmere mantle, placing it over the
          shoulders of her young lady, as she said the
          carriage was waiting.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel advanced to the earl. "Good bye, papa."</p>
  <p>"Good night, my love," he answered, drawing her towards
          him, and kissing her sweet face. "Tell Mrs. Vane I
          will not have you kept out till morning hours: you
          are but a child yet. Mr. Carlyle, will you ring. <pb n="12"/> I am debarred from seeing my daughter to
          the carriage."</p>
  <p>"If your lordship will allow me—if Lady Isabel will
          pardon the attendance of one, little used to wait
          upon young ladies, I shall be proud to see her to
          her carriage," was the somewhat confused answer of
          Mr. Carlyle, as he touched the bell.</p>
  <p>The earl thanked him, the young lady smiled, and Mr.
          Carlyle conducted her down the broad lighted
          staircase, and stood bareheaded by the door of the
          luxurious chariot, and handed her in. She put out
          her hand in her frank pleasant manner, as she wished
          him good night. The carriage rolled on its way, and
          Mr. Carlyle returned to the earl.</p>
  <p>"Well, is she not a handsome girl?" he demanded.</p>
  <p>"Handsome is not the word for beauty such as hers," was
          Mr. Carlyle's reply, in a low warm tone. "I never
          saw a face half so beautiful."</p>
  <p>"She caused quite a sensation at the Drawing-room last
          week—as I hear. This everlasting gout kept me
          in-doors all day. And she is as good as she is
          beautiful."</p>
  <p>The earl was not partial. Lady Isabel was wondrously
          gifted by nature, not only in mind and person, but
          in heart. She was as little like a fashionable young
          lady as it was well possible to be, partly because
          she had hitherto been secluded from the great world,
          partly from the care bestowed upon her training.
          During the lifetime of her mother, she had lived
          occasionally at East Lynne, but mostly at a larger
          seat of the earl's in Wales, Mount Severn: since her
          mother's death, she had remained entirely at Mount
          Severn, under the charge of a judicious governess, a
          very small establishment <pb n="13"/> being kept up
          for them, and the earl paying them impromptu and
          flying visits. Generous and benevolent she was;
          timid and sensitive to a degree; gentle and
          considerate to all. Do not cavil at her being thus
          praised: admire and love her whilst you may, she is
          worthy of it now, in her innocent girlhood: the time
          will come when such praise would be misplaced. Could
          the fate, that was to overtake his child, have been
          foreseen by the earl, he would have struck her down
          to death, in his love, as she stood before him,
          rather than suffer her to enter upon it.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER II. THE BROKEN CROSS.</head>
  <p><hi>Lady Isabel's</hi> carriage continued its way, and
          deposited her at the residence of Mrs. Levison. Mrs.
          Levison was nearly eighty years of age, and very
          severe in speech and manner; or, as Mrs. Vane
          expressed it, "crabbed." She looked the image of
          impatience when Isabel entered, with her cap pushed
          all awry as she pulled at her black satin gown, for
          Mrs. Vane had kept her waiting dinner, and Isabel
          was keeping her from her tea: and that does not
          agree with the aged, with their health or their
          temper.</p>
  <p>"I fear I am late," exclaimed Lady Isabel, as she
          advanced to Mrs. Levison, "but a gentleman dined
          with papa to-day, and it made us rather longer at
          table."</p>
  <p>"You are twenty-five minutes behind your time," cried the
          old lady, sharply, "and I want my tea. Emma, order
          it in."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Vane rang the bell, and did as she was bid. She was
          a little woman of six-and-twenty, very plain in
          face, but elegant in figure, vastly accomplished,
          and vain to her finger's ends. Her mother, who was
          dead, had been Mrs. Levison's daughter, and her
          husband, Raymond Vane, was presumptive heir to the
          earldom of Mount Severn.</p>
  <pb n="15"/>
  <p>"Won't you take that tippet off, child?" asked Mrs.
          Levison, who knew nothing of the new-fashioned names
          for such articles; mantle, bernous, and all the
          string of them. Isabel threw it off and sat down by
          her.</p>
  <p>"The tea is not made, grandmamma!" exclaimed Mrs. Vane,
          in an accent of astonishment, as the servants
          appeared with the tray and the silver urn. "You
          surely do not have it made in the room!"</p>
  <p>"Where should I have it made?" inquired Mrs. Levison.</p>
  <p>"It is much more convenient to have it brought in, ready
          made," said Mrs. Vane. "I dislike the
            <hi>embarras</hi> of making it."</p>
  <p>"Indeed!" was the reply of the old lady: "and get it
          slopped over in the saucers, and as cold as milk!
          You always were lazy, Emma—and given to use those
          French words. I'd rather stick a printed label on my
          forehead, for my part, 'I speak French,' and let the
          world know it that way."</p>
  <p>"Who makes tea for you in general?" asked Mrs. Vane,
          telegraphing a contemptuous grimace to Isabel behind
          her grandmother.</p>
  <p>But the eyes of Lady Isabel fell timidly, and a blush
          rose to her cheeks. She did not like to appear to
          differ from Mrs. Vane, her senior, and her father's
          guest; but her mind revolted at the bare idea of
          ingratitude or ridicule, cast to an aged parent.</p>
  <p>"Harriet comes in and makes it for me," replied Mrs.
          Levison: "ay, and sits down and takes it with me
          when I am alone, which is pretty often. What do you
          say to that, Madam Emma; you, with your fine
          notions?"</p>
  <p>"Just as you please, of course, grandmamma."</p>
  <pb n="16"/>
  <p>"And there's the tea-caddy at your elbow, and the urn's
          fizzing away, and if we are to have any tea
          to-night, it had better be made."</p>
  <p>"I don't know how much to put in," grumbled Mrs. Vane,
          who had the greatest horror of soiling her hands or
          her gloves: who, in short, had a particular
          antipathy to doing anything useful.</p>
  <p>"Shall I make it, dear Mrs. Levison?" said Isabel, rising
          with alacrity. "I used to make it at Mount Severn,
          and I make it for papa."</p>
  <p>"Do, child," replied the old lady. "You are worth ten of
          her."</p>
  <p>Isabel laughed merrily, drew off her gloves, and sat down
          to the table: and at that moment a young and elegant
          man lounged into the room. He was deemed handsome,
          with his clearly-cut features, his dark eyes, his
          raven hair, and his white teeth: but, to a keen
          observer, those features had not an attractive
          expression, and the dark eyes had a great knack of
          looking away while he spoke to you. It was Francis,
          Captain Levison.</p>
  <p>He was grandson to the old lady, and first cousin to Mrs.
          Vane. Few men were so fascinating in manners (at
          times and seasons), in face, and in form, few men
          won so completely upon their hearers' ears, and few
          were so heartless in their heart of hearts. The
          world courted him, and society humoured him: for,
          though he was a graceless spendthrift, and it was
          known that he was, he was the presumptive heir to
          the old and rich Sir Peter Levison.</p>
  <p>The ancient lady spoke up. "Captain Levison; Lady Isabel
          Vane." They both acknowledged the introduction: and
          Isabel, a child yet in the ways of <pb n="17"/> the
          world, blushed crimson at the admiring looks cast
          upon her by the young Guardsman. Strange—strange
          that she should make the acquaintance of those two
          men in the same day, almost in the same hour: the
          two, of all the human race, who were to exercise so
          powerful an influence over her future life!</p>
  <p>"That's a pretty cross, child," cried Mrs. Levison, as
          Isabel stood by her when tea was over, and she and
          Mrs. Vane were about to depart on their evening
          visit.</p>
  <p>She alluded to a golden cross, set with seven emeralds,
          which Isabel wore round her neck. It was of light,
          delicate texture, and was suspended from a thin,
          short gold chain.</p>
  <p>"Is it not pretty!" answered Isabel. "It was given me by
          my dear mamma just before she died. Stay, I will
          take it off for you. I only wear it upon great
          occasions."</p>
  <p>This, her first grand party at a duke's, seemed a very
          great occasion to the simply reared and
          inexperienced girl. She unclasped the chain, and
          placed it with the cross in the hands of Mrs.
          Levison.</p>
  <p>"Why, I declare you have nothing on, but that cross and
          some rubbishing pearl bracelets!" uttered Mrs. Vane
          to Isabel. "I did not look at you before."</p>
  <p>"Mamma gave me both. The bracelets are those she used
          frequently to wear."</p>
  <p>"You old-fashioned child! Because your mamma wore those
          bracelets, years ago, is that a reason for your
          doing so?" retorted Mrs. Vane. "Why did you not put
          on your diamonds?"</p>
  <p>"I—did—put on my diamonds; but I—took them off again,"
          stammered Isabel.</p>
  <pb n="18"/>
  <p>"What on earth for?"</p>
  <p>"I did not like to be too fine," answered Isabel, with a
          laugh and a blush. "They glittered so! I feared it
          might be thought I had put them on <hi>to look</hi>
          fine."</p>
  <p>"Ah! I see you mean to set up in that class of people who
          pretend to despise ornaments," scornfully remarked
          Mrs. Vane. "It is the refinement of affectation,
          Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>The sneer fell harmlessly on Isabel's ear. She only
          believed something had put Mrs. Vane out of temper.
          It certainly had: and that something, though Isabel
          little suspected it, was the evident admiration
          Captain Levison evinced for her fresh young beauty.
          It quite absorbed him, and rendered him neglectful
          even of Mrs. Vane.</p>
  <p>"Here, child, take your cross," said the old lady. "It is
          very pretty; prettier on your neck than diamonds
          would be. You don't want embellishing: never mind
          what Emma says."</p>
  <p>Francis Levison took the cross and chain from her hand to
          pass them to Lady Isabel. Whether he was awkward, or
          whether her hands were full, for she held her
          gloves, her handkerchief, and had just taken up her
          mantle, certain it is, that it fell; and the
          gentleman, in his too quick effort to regain it,
          managed to set his foot upon it, and the cross was
          broken in two.</p>
  <p>"There! Now whose fault was that?" cried Mrs.
          Levison.</p>
  <p>Isabel did not answer: her heart was very full. She took
          the broken cross, and the tears dropped from her
          eyes: she could not help it.</p>
  <p>"Why! you are never crying over a stupid bauble <pb n="19"/> of a cross!" uttered Mrs. Vane,
          interrupting Captain Levison's expressions of regret
          at his awkwardness.</p>
  <p>"You can have it mended, dear," interposed Mrs.
          Levison.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel chased away the tears, and turned to Captain
          Levison with a cheerful look. "Pray do not blame
          yourself," she good-naturedly said; "the fault was
          as much mine as yours: and, as Mrs. Levison says, I
          can get it mended."</p>
  <p>She disengaged the upper part of the cross from the chain
          as she spoke, and clasped the latter round her
          neck.</p>
  <p>"You will not go with that thin string of gold on, and
          nothing else!" uttered Mrs. Vane.</p>
  <p>"Why not?" returned Isabel. "If people say anything, I
          can tell them an accident happened to the
          cross."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Vane burst into a laugh of mocking ridicule. "'If
          people say anything!'" she repeated, in a tone
          according with the laugh. "They are not likely to
          'say anything,' but they will deem Lord Mount
          Severn's daughter unfortunately short of
          jewellery."</p>
  <p>Isabel smiled, and shook her head. "They saw my diamonds
          at the Drawing-room."</p>
  <p>"If you had done such an awkward thing for me, Francis
          Levison," burst forth the old lady, "my doors should
          have been closed against you for a month. There! if
          you are to go, Emma, you had better go: dancing off
          to begin an evening at ten o'clock at night! In my
          time we used to go at seven: but it's the custom now
          to turn night into day."</p>
  <p>"When George the Third dined at one o'clock upon boiled
          mutton and turnips," put in the graceless captain,
            <pb n="20"/> who certainly held his grandmother in
          no greater reverence than did Mrs. Vane.</p>
  <p>He turned to Isabel as he spoke, to hand her down stairs.
          Thus she was conducted to her carriage the second
          time that night by a stranger. Mrs. Vane got down by
          herself, as she best could, and her temper was not
          improved by the process.</p>
  <p>"Good night," said she to the captain.</p>
  <p>"I shall not say good night. You will find me there
          almost as soon as you."</p>
  <p>"You told me you were not coming. Some bachelors' party
          in the way."</p>
  <p>"Yes, but I have changed my mind. Farewell for the
          present, Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"What an object you will look, with nothing on your neck
          but a school-girl's chain!" began Mrs. Vane,
          returning to the grievance as the carriage drove
          on.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Mrs. Vane, what does it signify! I can only think of
          my broken cross. I am sure it must be an evil
          omen."</p>
  <p>"An evil—what?"</p>
  <p>"An evil omen. Mamma gave me that cross when she was
          dying. She told me to let it be to me as a talisman,
          always to keep it safely; and when I was in any
          distress, or in need of counsel, to look at it, and
          strive to recal what her advice would be, and to act
          accordingly. And now it is broken—broken!"</p>
  <p>A glaring gas-light flashed into the carriage, right into
          the face of Isabel. "I declare," uttered Mrs. Vane,
          "you are crying again! I tell you what, Isabel: I am
          not going to chaperone red eyes to the Duchess of
          Dartford's, so if you can't put a stop to this, I
          shall order the carriage home, and go on alone."</p>
  <pb n="21"/>
  <p>Isabel meekly dried her eyes, sighing deeply as she did
          so. "I can have the pieces joined, I dare say; but
          it will never be the same cross to me again."</p>
  <p>"What have you done with the pieces?" irascibly asked
          Mrs. Vane.</p>
  <p>"I folded them in the thin paper Mrs. Levison gave me,
          and put it inside my frock. Here it is," touching
          the body. "I have no pocket on."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Vane gave vent to a groan. She never had been a girl
          herself, she had been a woman at ten; and she
          complimented Isabel upon being little better than an
          imbecile. "'Put it inside my frock!'" she uttered,
          in a tone of scorn. "And you eighteen years of age!
          I fancied you left off 'frocks' when you left the
          nursery."</p>
  <p>"I meant to say my dress," corrected Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Meant to say you are a baby idiot!" was the inward
          comment of Mrs. Vane.</p>
  <p>A few minutes, and Isabel forgot her grievance. The
          brilliant rooms were to her as an enchanting scene
          of dreamland, for her heart was in its spring-tide
          of early freshness, and the satiety of experience
          had not come. How could she remember even the broken
          cross, as she bent to the homage offered her, and
          drank in the honeyed words poured forth into her
          ear?</p>
  <p>"Halloa!" cried an Oxford student, with a long rent-roll
          in prospective, who was screwing himself against the
          wall, not to be in the way of the waltzers, "I
          thought you had given up coming to these
          places."</p>
  <p>"So I had," replied the fast nobleman addressed; "but I
          am on the look out, so am forced into them again. I
          think a ball-room the greatest bore in life."</p>
  <p>"On the look-out for what?"</p>
  <pb n="22"/>
  <p>"For a wife. My governor has stopped supplies, and has
          vowed, by his beard, not to advance another
          shilling, or pay a debt, till I reform. As a
          preliminary step towards it, he insists upon a wife,
          and I am trying to choose one, for I am deeper in
          than you can imagine."</p>
  <p>"Take the new beauty, then."</p>
  <p>"Who is she?"</p>
  <p>"Lady Isabel Vane."</p>
  <p>"Much obliged for the suggestion," replied the earl. "But
          one likes a respectable father-in-law. Mount Severn
          and I are too much in the same line, and might clash
          in the long run."</p>
  <p>"One can't have everything: the girl's beauty is beyond
          common. I saw that rake, Levison, make up to her. He
          fancies he can carry all before him, where women are
          concerned."</p>
  <p>"So he does, often," was the quiet reply.</p>
  <p>"I hate the fellow! He thinks so much of himself, with
          his curled hair, and his shining teeth, and his
          white hands; he's as heartless as an owl. What was
          that hushed-up business about Miss Charteris?"</p>
  <p>"Who's to know? Levison slipped out of the escapade like
          an eel, and the women protested that he was more
          sinned against than sinning. Three-fourths of the
          world believed them. Here he comes! And Mount
          Severn's daughter with him."</p>
  <p>They were approaching at that moment, Francis Levison and
          Lady Isabel. He was expressing his regret at the
          untoward accident of the cross, for the tenth time
          that night. "I feel that it can never be atoned
          for," whispered he; "that the heartfelt homage of my
          whole life would not be sufficient
          compensation."</p>
  <pb n="23"/>
  <p>He spoke in a tone of thrilling gentleness, gratifying to
          the ear but dangerous to the heart. Lady Isabel
          glanced up, and caught his eyes fixed upon her with
          the deepest tenderness, a language hers had never
          yet encountered. A vivid blush again rose to her
          cheek, her eyelids fell, and her timid words died
          away in silence.</p>
  <p>"Take care, take care my young Lady Isabel," murmured the
          Oxonian under his breath as they passed him, "that
          man is as false as he is high."</p>
  <p>"I think he's a rascal," remarked the earl.</p>
  <p>"I know he is: I know a thing or two about him. He would
          ruin her heart for the renown of the exploit,
          because she's a beauty, and then fling it away
          broken. He has none to give in return for the
          gift."</p>
  <p>"Just as much as my race-horse has," concluded the earl.
          "She is very beautiful."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER III. BARBARA HARE.</head>
  <p><hi>West Lynne</hi> was a town of some importance,
          particularly in its own eyes, though being neither a
          manufacturing town nor a cathedral town, nor even
          the chief town of the county, it was somewhat
          primitive in its manners and customs. It sent two
          members to parliament, and it boasted a good
          market-place, covered over, and a large room above
          that, which was called the "town-hall," where the
          justices met and transacted their business—for the
          county magistrates still retained, there, that
          nearly obsolete name. Passing out at the town,
          towards the east, you came upon several detached
          gentlemen's houses, in the vicinity of which stood
          the church of St. Jude, which was more aristocratic
          (in the matter of its congregation) than the other
          churches of West Lynne. For about a mile these
          houses were scattered, the church being situated at
          their commencement close to the busy part of the
          place, and about a mile further on, you came upon
          the beautiful estate which was called East Lynne. As
          you drove along the road you might admire its green,
          undulating park; not as you walked, for an envious
          wall, mounting itself unconscionably high,
          obstructed your view. Large, beautiful trees
          affording a shelter, alike for human beings <pb n="25"/> and for the deer, on a day of summer's
          heat, rose in that park, and a great gate between
          two lodges on the right-hand side the road, gave you
          entrance to it, and conducted you to the house. It
          was not a very large house, compared with some
          country seats, but it was built in the villa style,
          was white and remarkably cheerful, altogether a
          desirable place to look upon.</p>
  <p>Between the gentlemen's houses mentioned, and East Lynne,
          the mile of road was very solitary, much
          overshadowed by trees. One house alone stood there,
          and that was about three-quarters of a mile before
          you came to East Lynne, and full a quarter of a mile
          after you had passed the houses. It was on the
          left-hand side, a square ugly red brick house with a
          weathercock on the top, standing some little
          distance from the road. A flat lawn extended before
          it, and close to the palings, which divided it from
          the road, was a grove of trees, some yards in depth.
          The lawn was divided by a narrow middle gravel path,
          to which you gained access from the road by a narrow
          iron gate, which took you to the rustic portico of
          the house. You entered upon a large flagged hall
          with a reception-room on either hand, and the
          staircase, a wide one, facing you; by the side of
          the staircase you passed on to the servants'
          apartments and offices. This place was called the
          Grove, and was the property and residence of Richard
          Hare, Esquire, commonly called Mr. Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>The room to the left hand, as you went in, was the
          general sitting-room, the other was very much kept
          boxed up in lavender and brown holland, to be opened
          on state occasions. Justice and Mrs. Hare had three
          children, a son and two daughters. Anne was the
          elder of the girls, and had married young; Barbara,
          the <pb n="26"/> younger, was now nineteen; and
          Richard, the eldest— But we shall come to him
          hereafter.</p>
  <p>In this sitting-room, on a chilly evening early in May, a
          few days subsequent to that which had witnessed the
          visit of Mr. Carlyle to the Earl of Mount Severn,
          sat Mrs. Hare, a pale, delicate woman, buried in
          shawls and cushions: her arm-chair was drawn to the
          hearth, though there was no fire: but the day had
          been warm. At the window sat a pretty girl, very
          fair, with blue eyes, light hair, a bright
          complexion, and small aquiline features. She was
          listlessly turning over the leaves of a book.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, I am sure it must be tea-time now."</p>
  <p>"Time seems to move slowly with you, mamma. It is
          scarcely a quarter of an hour since I told you it
          was but ten minutes past six."</p>
  <p>"I am so thirsty," murmured the poor invalid. "Do go and
          look at the clock again, Barbara."</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare rose with a gesture of impatience, opened
          the door, and glanced at the large clock in the
          hall. "It wants nine-and-twenty minutes to seven,
          mamma. I wish you would put your watch on of a day:
          four times you have sent me to look at that clock
          since dinner."</p>
  <p>"I am so thirsty," repeated Mrs. Hare, with a sort of
          sob. "If seven o'clock would but strike! I am dying
          for my tea."</p>
  <p>It may occur to the reader that a lady in her own house,
          "dying for her tea," might surely order it brought
          in, although the customary hour had not struck. Not
          so Mrs. Hare. Since her husband had first brought
          her home to that house, four-and-twenty years ago,
          she had never dared to express a will in it; <pb n="27"/> scarcely, on her own responsibility, to
          give an order. Justice Hare was stern, imperative,
          obstinate, and self-conceited; she, timid, gentle,
          and submissive. She had loved him with all her
          heart, and her life had been one long yielding of
          her will to his: in fact, she had no will; his, was
          all in all. Far was she from feeling the servitude a
          yoke: some natures do not: and, to do Mr. Hare
          justice, his powerful will, that <hi>must</hi> bear
          down all before it, was in fault; not his kindness:
          he never meant to be unkind to his wife. Of his
          three children, Barbara alone had inherited this
          will, but in her it was softened down.</p>
  <p>"Barbara," began Mrs. Hare again, when she thought
          another quarter of an hour at least must have
          elapsed.</p>
  <p>"Well, mamma."</p>
  <p>"Ring, and tell them to be getting it in readiness, so
          that when seven strikes there may be no delay."</p>
  <p>"Goodness, mamma! you know they always do have it ready.
          And there's no such hurry, for papa may not be
          home." But she rose, and rang the bell with a
          petulant motion, and when the man answered it, told
          him to have tea in to its time.</p>
  <p>"If you knew, dear, how dry my throat is, how parched my
          mouth, you would have more patience with me."</p>
  <p>Barbara closed her book, kissed her mamma with a
          repentant air, and turned listlessly to the window.
          She seemed tired, not with fatigue, but with what
          the French express by the word <hi>ennui</hi> .
          "Here comes papa," she presently said.</p>
  <p>"Oh, I am so glad!" cried poor Mrs. Hare. "Perhaps he
          will not mind having the tea in at once, if I tell
          him how thirsty I am."</p>
  <pb n="28"/>
  <p>The justice came in. A middle-sized man, with pompous
          features, a pompous walk, and a flaxen wig. In his
          aquiline nose, compressed lips, and pointed chin,
          might be traced a resemblance to his daughter:
          though he never could have been half so good-looking
          as was pretty Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Richard," said Mrs. Hare from between her shawls, the
          instant he opened the door.</p>
  <p>"Well?"</p>
  <p>"Would you please let me have tea in now? Would you very
          much mind taking it a little earlier this evening? I
          am feverish again, and my tongue is so parched, I
          don't know how to speak."</p>
  <p>"Oh, it's near seven: you won't have long to wait."</p>
  <p>With this exceedingly gracious answer to an invalid's
          request, Mr. Hare quitted the room again, and banged
          the door. He had not spoken unkindly or roughly,
          simply with indifference. But, ere Mrs. Hare's meek
          sigh of disappointment was over, the door was
          re-opened, and the flaxen wig thrust in again.</p>
  <p>"I don't mind if I do have it now. It will be a fine
          moonlight night, and I am going with Pinner as far
          as Beauchamp's, to smoke a pipe. Order it in,
          Barbara."</p>
  <p>The tea was made, and partaken of, and the justice
          departed for Mr. Beauchamp's, Squire Pinner calling
          for him at the gate. Mr. Beauchamp was a gentleman
          who farmed a great deal of land, and who was also
          Lord Mount Severn's agent, or steward, for East
          Lynne. He lived higher up the road, some little
          distance beyond East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"I am so cold, Barbara," shivered Mrs. Hare, as she
          watched the justice down the gravel path. "I <pb n="29"/> wonder if your papa would say it was
          foolish of me, if I told them to light a bit of
          fire?"</p>
  <p>"Have it lighted if you like," responded Barbara, ringing
          the bell. "Papa will know nothing about it, one way
          or the other, for he won't be home till after
          bedtime. Jasper, mamma is cold, and would like a
          fire lighted."</p>
  <p>"Plenty of sticks, Jasper, that it may burn up quickly,"
          said Mrs. Hare, in a pleading voice; as if the
          sticks were Jasper's, and not hers.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare got her fire, and she drew her chair in front,
          and put her feet on the fender, to catch its warmth.
          Barbara, listless still, went into the hall, took a
          woollen shawl from the stand there, threw it over
          her shoulders, and went out. She strolled down the
          straight, formal path, and stood at the iron gate,
          looking over it into the public road. Not very
          public in that spot, and at that hour, but as lonely
          as one could wish. The night was calm and pleasant,
          though somewhat chilly for the beginning of May, and
          the moon was getting high in the sky.</p>
  <p>"When will he come home?" she murmured, as she leaned
          head upon the gate. "Oh, what would life be, without
          him? How miserable these few days have been! I
          wonder what took him there! I wonder what is
          detaining him! Cornelia said he was only gone for a
          day."</p>
  <p>The faint echo of footsteps in the distance stole upon
          her ear, and Barbara drew a little back, and hid
          herself under shelter of the trees, not choosing to
          be seen by any stray passer-by. But, as they drew
          near, a sudden change came over her; her eyes
          lighted up, her cheeks were dyed with crimson, and
          her veins tingled with <pb n="30"/> excess of
          rapture—for she knew those footsteps, and loved
          them, only too well.</p>
  <p>Cautiously peeping over the gate again, she looked down
          the road. A tall form, whose very height and
          strength bore a grace of which its owner was
          unconscious, was advancing rapidly towards her from
          the direction of West Lynne. Again she shrank away:
          true love is ever timid: and whatever may have been
          Barbara Hare's other qualities, her love at least
          was true and deep. But, instead of the gate opening,
          with the firm, quick motion peculiar to the hand
          which guided it, the footsteps seemed to pass, and
          not to have turned at all towards it. Barbara's
          heart sank, and she stole to the gate again, and
          looked out with a yearning look.</p>
  <p>Yes, sure enough, he was striding on, not thinking of
          her, not coming to her; and she, in the
          disappointment and impulse of the moment, called to
          him.</p>
  <p>"Archibald!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle—it was no other—turned on his heel, and
          approached the gate.</p>
  <p>"Is it you, Barbara! Watching for thieves and poachers?
          How are you?</p>
  <p>"How are you?" she returned, holding the gate open for
          him to enter, as he shook hands, and striving to
          calm down her agitation. "When did you return?"</p>
  <p>"Only now: by the eight o'clock train. Which got in
          beyond its time, having dawdled unpardonably at the
          stations. They little thought they had me in it, as
          their looks betrayed, when I got out. I have not
          been home yet."</p>
  <p>"No! What will Cornelia say?"</p>
  <p>"I went into the office for five minutes. But I have <pb n="31"/> a few words to say to Beauchamp, and am
          going up at once. Thank you, I cannot come in now: I
          intend to do so on my return."</p>
  <p>"Papa has gone up to Mr. Beauchamp's."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Hare! Has he?"</p>
  <p>"He and Squire Pinner," continued Barbara. "They are gone
          to have a smoking bout. And if you wait there with
          papa, it will be too late to come in, for he is sure
          not to be home before eleven or twelve."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle bent his head in deliberation. "Then I think
          it is of little use my going on," said he, "for my
          business with Beauchamp is private. I must defer it
          until to-morrow."</p>
  <p>He took the gate out of her hand, closed it, and placed
          the hand within his own arm, to walk with her to the
          house. It was done in a matter-of-fact, real sort of
          way, with nothing of romance or sentiment: but
          Barbara Hare felt that she was in Eden.</p>
  <p>"And how have you all been, Barbara, these few days?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, very well. What made you start off so suddenly? You
          never said you were going, or came to wish us good
          bye."</p>
  <p>"You have just expressed it, Barbara—'suddenly.' A matter
          of business suddenly arose, and I suddenly went up
          upon it."</p>
  <p>"Cornelia said you were only gone for a day."</p>
  <p>"Did she. When in London I find many things to do. Is
          Mrs. Hare better?"</p>
  <p>"Just the same. I think mamma's ailments are fancies,
          half of them: if she would but rouse herself, she
          would be better. What is in that parcel?"</p>
  <p>"You are not to inquire, Miss Barbara. It does not
          concern you. It only concerns Mrs. Hare."</p>
  <pb n="32"/>
  <p>"It is something you have brought for mamma,
          Archibald!"</p>
  <p>"Of course. A countryman's visit to London entails buying
          presents for his friends: at least, it used to do so
          in the old-fashioned days."</p>
  <p>"When people made their wills before starting, and were a
          fortnight doing the journey in the waggon," laughed
          Barbara. "Grandpapa used to tell us tales of that,
          when we were children. But is it really something
          for mamma?"</p>
  <p>"Don't I tell you so? I have brought something for
          you."</p>
  <p>"Oh! What is it?" she uttered, her colour rising, and
          wondering whether he was in jest or earnest.</p>
  <p>"There's an impatient girl! 'What is it?' Wait a moment,
          and you shall see what it is."</p>
  <p>He put the parcel, or roll, he was carrying, upon a
          garden-chair, and proceeded to search his pockets.
          Every pocket was visited, apparently in vain.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, I think it is gone. I must have lost it
          somehow."</p>
  <p>Her heart beat as she stood there silently, looking up at
          him in the moonlight. <hi>Was</hi> it lost?
            <hi>What</hi> had it been?</p>
  <p>But, upon a second search, he came upon something in the
          pocket of his coat-tail. "Here it is, I believe:
          what brought it in there?" He opened a small box,
          and taking out a long gold chain, threw it round her
          neck. A locket was attached to it.</p>
  <p>Her cheeks' crimson went and came, her heart beat more
          rapidly. She could not speak a word of thanks; and
          Mr. Carlyle took up the roll, and walked on into the
          presence of Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <pb n="33"/>
  <p>Barbara followed in a few minutes. Her mother was
          standing up, watching with pleased expectation the
          movements of Mr. Carlyle. No candles were in the
          room, but it was bright with firelight.</p>
  <p>"Now don't you laugh at me," quoth he, untying the string
          of the parcel. "It is not a roll of velvet for a
          dress, and it is not a roll of parchment, conferring
          twenty thousand pounds a year. But it is—an
          aircushion!"</p>
  <p>It was what poor Mrs. Hare, so worn with sitting and
          lying, had often longed for: she had heard such a
          luxury was to be bought in London, but never
          remembered to have seen one. She took it almost with
          a greedy hand, casting a grateful look at Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"How am I to thank you for it?" she murmured through her
          tears.</p>
  <p>"If you thank me at all, I will never bring you anything
          again," cried he, gaily, pleased to see her so
          pleased; for, whatever the justice and Barbara may
          have done, <hi>he</hi> felt lively pity for Mrs.
          Hare, sympathising with her sufferings. "I have
          heard you wish for the comfort of an air-cushion,
          and happening to see some displayed in a window in
          the Strand, it put me in mind to bring you one."</p>
  <p>"How thin it is!" exclaimed Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"Thin! Oh yes, thin at present, because it is not
          'fixed,' as our friends over the Atlantic say. See:
          this is the way to fill it with air. There; it is
          thick now."</p>
  <p>"It was so truly kind of you to think of me,
          Archibald!"</p>
  <p>"I have been telling Barbara that a visit to London
          entails bringing gifts for friends," returned Mr.
          Carlyle. "Do you see how smart I have made
          Barbara?"</p>
  <pb n="34"/>
  <p>Barbara hastily took off the chain, and laid it before
          her mother.</p>
  <p>"What a beautiful chain!" uttered Mrs. Hare, in surprise.
          "Archibald, you are too good, too generous! This
          must have cost a great deal: this is beyond a
          trifle."</p>
  <p>"Nonsense!" laughed Mr. Carlyle. "I'll tell you both how
          I came to buy it. I went into a jeweller's about my
          watch, which has taken to lose lately in a most
          unceremonious fashion, and there I saw a whole
          display of chains, hanging up; some ponderous enough
          for a sheriff, some light and elegant enough for
          Barbara: I dislike to see a thick chain on a lady's
          neck. They put me in mind of the chain she lost the
          day she and Cornelia went with me to Lynneborough;
          which loss Barbara persisted in declaring was my
          fault, for dragging her through the town,
          sight-seeing, while Cornelia did her shopping."</p>
  <p>"But I was only joking, when I said so," was the
          interruption of Barbara. "Of course it would have
          happened had you not been with me: the links were
          always snapping."</p>
  <p>"Well: these chains in the shop in London put me in mind
          of Barbara's misfortune, and I chose one. Then the
          shopman brought forth some lockets, and enlarged
          upon their convenience for holding deceased
          relatives' hair, not to speak of sweethearts', until
          I told him he might attach one. I thought it might
          hold that piece of hair you prize, Barbara," he
          concluded, dropping his voice.</p>
  <p>"What piece?" asked Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced round the room, as if fearful the
          very walls might hear his whisper. "Richard's.
          Barbara <pb n="35"/> showed it me one day when she
          was turning out her desk, and said it was a curl cut
          off in that illness."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare sank back in her chair, and hid her face in her
          hands shivering visibly. The words evidently awoke
          some poignant source of deep sorrow. "Oh, my boy! my
          boy!" she wailed: "my boy! my unhappy boy! Mr. Hare
          wonders at my ill-health, Archibald; Barbara
          ridicules it; but there lies the source of all my
          misery, mental and bodily. Oh, Richard!
          Richard!"</p>
  <p>There was a distressing pause; for the topic admitted of
          neither hope nor consolation. "Put your chain on
          again, Barbara," Mr. Carlyle said, after a while,
          "and I wish you health to wear it out. Health and
          reformation, young lady."</p>
  <p>Barbara smiled, and glanced at him with her pretty blue
          eyes, so full of love. "What have you brought for
          Cornelia?" she resumed.</p>
  <p>"Something splendid," he answered, with a mock serious
          face; "only, I hope I have not been taken in. I
          bought her a shawl. The vendors vowed it was true
          Parisian cashmere: I hope it won't turn out to be
          common Manchester."</p>
  <p>"If it does, Cornelia will not know the difference."</p>
  <p>"I can't answer for that. But, for my part, I don't see
          why foreign goods should bear the palm over
          British," observed Mr. Carlyle, becoming national.
          "If I wore shawls, I would discard the best French
          one ever made, for a good honest one from our own
          manufactories, Norwich or Paisley."</p>
  <p>"Wait till you do wear them, you would soon tell a
          different tale," said Barbara, significantly.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare took her hands from her pale face. "What was
          the price?" she inquired.</p>
  <pb n="36"/>
  <p>"If I tell you, you must promise not to betray it to
          Cornelia. She would rail at me for extravagance, and
          lay it up between folds of tissue paper, and never
          bring it out again. I gave eighteen guineas."</p>
  <p>"That is a great deal," observed Mrs. Hare. "It ought to
          be a very good one. I never gave more than six
          guineas for a shawl in all my life."</p>
  <p>"And Cornelia, I dare say, never more than half six,"
          laughed Mr. Carlyle. "Well, I shall wish you good
          evening and go to her, for if she knows I am back,
          all this while, I shall be lectured."</p>
  <p>He shook hands with them both. Barbara, however,
          accompanied him to the front door, and stepped
          outside with him.</p>
  <p>"You will catch cold, Barbara. You have left your shawl
          in-doors."</p>
  <p>"Oh no, I shall not. How very soon you are leaving: you
          have scarcely stayed ten minutes."</p>
  <p>"But you forget I have not been home."</p>
  <p>"You were on your road to Beauchamp's, and would not have
          been home for an hour or two in that case," spoke
          Barbara, in a tone that savoured of resentment.</p>
  <p>"That was different: that was upon business: and nobody
          allows for business more readily than Cornelia. But
          I shall not hear the last of it, if I suffer
          anything, but business, to keep me away from her:
          she has five hundred inquiries, touching London, at
          her tongue's end this instant, be you very sure.
          Barbara, I think your mamma looks unusually
          ill."</p>
  <p>"You know how she suffers a little thing to upset her,
          and last night she had what she calls one of her
          dreams," answered Barbara. "She says it is a warning
            <pb n="37"/> that something bad is going tò
          happen, and she has been in the most unhappy,
          feverish state possible all day. Papa has been quite
          angry about her being so weak and nervous, declaring
          that she ought to rouse herself out of 'nerves.' Of
          course we dare not tell him about the dream."</p>
  <p>"It related to—the—"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stopped, and Barbara glanced round with a
          shudder, and drew closer to him as she whispered. He
          had not given her his arm this time.</p>
  <p>"Yes; to the murder. You know mamma has always declared
          that Bethel had something to do with it, she says
          her dreams would have convinced her of it, if
          nothing else did, and she dreamt she saw him
          with—with—you know."</p>
  <p>"Hallijohn?" whispered Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"With Hallijohn," assented Barbara, with a shiver. "He
          appeared to be standing over him, as he lay on the
          floor; just as he <hi>did</hi> lie on it. And that
          wretched Afy was standing at the end of the kitchen,
          looking on."</p>
  <p>"But Mrs. Hare ought not to suffer dreams to disturb her
          peace by day," remonstrated Mr. Carlyle. "It is not
          to be surprised at, that she dreams of the murder,
          because she is always dwelling upon it, but she
          should strive and throw the feeling from her with
          the night."</p>
  <p>"You know what mamma is. Of course she ought to do so,
          but she cannot. Papa wonders what makes her get up
          so ill and trembling of a morning, and mamma has to
          make all sorts of excuses, for not a hint, as you
          aware, must be breathed to him about the
          murder."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle gravely nodded.</p>
  <p>"Mamma does so harp upon Bethel. And I know <pb n="38"/>
          that this dream arose from nothing in the world but
          because she saw him pass the gate yesterday. Not
          that she thinks it was he who did it; unfortunately,
          there is no room for that: but she will persist that
          he had a hand in it in some way: and he haunts her
          dreams."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle walked on in silence: indeed, there was no
          reply that he could make. A cloud had fallen upon
          the house of Mr. Hare, and it was an unhappy
          subject. Barbara continued:</p>
  <p>"But, for mamma to have taken it into her head that 'some
          evil is going to happen' because she has had this
          dream, and to make herself miserable over it, is so
          very absurd, that I have felt quite cross with her
          all day. Such nonsense, you know, Archibald, to
          believe that dreams give signs of what is going to
          happen? so far behind these enlightened days!"</p>
  <p>"Your mamma's trouble is great, Barbara; and she is not
          strong."</p>
  <p>"I think all our troubles have been great since— since
          that dark evening," responded Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Have you heard from Anne?" inquired Mr. Carlyle, willing
          to change the subject.</p>
  <p>"Yes, she is very well. What do you think they are going
          to name the baby? Anne: after her and mamma. So very
          ugly a name! Anne!"</p>
  <p>"I do not think so," said M. Carlyle. "It is simple and
          unpretending; I like it much. Look at the long,
          pretentious names in our family—Archibald! Cornelia!
          And your's, too—Barbara! What a mouthful they all
          are!"</p>
  <p>Barbara contracted her eyebrows. It was equivalent to
          saying that he did not like her name.</p>
  <p>"Had the magistrates a busy day yesterday, do you know?"
          he resumed.</p>
  <pb n="39"/>
  <p>"Very much so, I believe. But you have not remained long
          enough for me to tell you any news."</p>
  <p>They reached the gate, and Mr. Carlyle was about to pass
          out of it, when Barbara laid her hand on his arm to
          detain him, and spoke in a timid voice.
          "Archibald."</p>
  <p>"What is it?"</p>
  <p>"I have not said a word of thanks to you for this," she
          said, touching the chain and locket: "my tongue
          seemed tied. Do not deem me ungrateful."</p>
  <p>"You foolish girl!—it is not worth thanks. There! now I
          am paid. Good night, Barbara."</p>
  <p>He had bent down and kissed her cheek; swung through the
          gate, laughing, and strode away. "Don't say I never
          give you anything," he turned his head round to say.
          "Good night."</p>
  <p>All her veins were tingling, all her pulses beating; her
          heart was throbbing with its sense of bliss. He had
          never kissed her, that she could remember, since she
          was a child. And when she returned in-doors, her
          spirits were so extravagantly high, that Mrs. Hare
          wondered.</p>
  <p>"Ring for the lamp, Barbara, and you can get to your
          work. But don't have the shutters closed: I like to
          look out on these light nights."</p>
  <p>Barbara, however, did not get to her work: she also
          perhaps liked "looking out, on a light night," for
          she sat down at the window. She was living the last
          half hour over again. "'Don't say I never give you
          anything,'" she murmured: "did he allude to the
          chain, or to the—the kiss? Oh Archibald! why don't
          you say that you love me?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle had been all his life upon intimate terms <pb n="40"/> with the Hares. His father's first
          wife—for the late Lawyer Carlyle had been twice
          married—had been a cousin of Justice Hare's, and
          this had caused the families to be much together.
          Archibald, the child of the second Mrs. Carlyle, had
          alternately teased and petted Anne and Barbara Hare,
          boy fashion. Sometimes he quarrelled with the pretty
          little girls, sometimes he caressed them, as he
          would have done had they been his sisters; and he
          made no scruple of declaring publicly to the pair,
          that Anne was his favourite. A gentle, yielding girl
          she was, like her mother; whereas Barbara displayed
          her own will, and it sometimes clashed with young
          Carlyle's.</p>
  <p>The clock struck ten. Mrs. Hare took her customary sup of
          brandy-and-water, a small tumbler three parts full.
          Without it, she believed she could never get to
          sleep: it deadened unhappy thought, she said.
          Barbara, after making it had turned again to the
          window, but she did not resume her seat. She stood
          right in front of it, her forehead bent forward
          against the middle pane. The lamp, casting a bright
          light, was behind her, so that her figure might be
          distinctly observable from the lawn, had any one
          been there to look upon it.</p>
  <p>She stood there in the midst of dreamland, giving way to
          all its enchanting and most delusive fascinations.
          She saw herself, in anticipation, the wife of Mr.
          Carlyle, the envied, thrice envied of all West
          Lynne: for, like as he was the dearest on earth to
          her heart, so was he the greatest match in the
          neighbourhood around. Not a mother but coveted him
          for her child; not a daughter but would have said
          "Yes, and thank you" to an offer from the attractive
          Archibald Carlyle. "I never <pb n="41"/> was sure,
          quite sure, of it till to-night," murmured Barbara,
          caressing the locket, and holding it to her cheek:
          "I always thought he might mean something, or he
          might mean nothing: but to give me this—to kiss
          me—oh Archibald!"</p>
  <p>A pause. Barbara's eyes were fixed upon the
          moonlight.</p>
  <p>"If he would but say he loved me! if he would but ease my
          aching heart! But it must come; I know it will; and
          if that cantankerous, cross, old Corny—"</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare stopped. What was that, at the far end of
          the lawn, just in advance of the shade of the thick
          trees? Their leaves were not causing the movement,
          for it was a still night. It had been there some
          minutes; it was evidently a human form. What
            <hi>was</hi> it? Surely it was making signs to
          her!</p>
  <p>Or else it looked as though it was. That was certainly
          its arm moving, and now it advanced a pace nearer,
          and raised something which it wore on its head —a
          battered hat with a broad brim, a "wide-awake,"
          encircled with a wisp of straw.</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare's heart leaped, as the saying runs, into her
          mouth, and her face became deadly white in the
          moonlight. Her first thought was to alarm the
          servants; her second, to be still; for she
          remembered the fear and mystery that attached to the
          house. She went into the hall, shutting her mamma in
          the parlour, and stood in the shade of the portico,
          gazing still. But the figure evidently followed her
          movements with its sight, and the hat was again
          taken off, and waved violently.</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare turned sick with utter terror; <hi>she</hi>
          must fathom it; she must see who and what it was;
            <pb n="42"/> for the servants she dared not call,
          and those movements were imperative, and might not
          be disregarded; but she possessed more innate
          courage than falls to the lot of some young
          ladies.</p>
  <p>"Mamma," she said, returning to the parlour and catching
          up her shawl, while striving to speak without
          emotion, "I shall just walk down the path, and see
          if papa is coming."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare did not reply. She was musing upon other
          things, in that quiescent, happy mood. which a small
          portion of spirits will impart to one weak in body;
          and Barbara softly closed the door, and stole out
          again to the portico. She stood a moment to rally
          her courage, and again the hat was waved
          impatiently.</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare commenced her walk towards it; an undefined
          sense of evil filling her sinking heart: mingling
          with which came, with a rush of terror, a fear of
          that other undefined evil—the evil Mrs. Hare had
          declared was foreboded in her dream.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER IV. THE MOONLIGHT INTERVIEW.</head>
  <p><hi>Cold</hi> and still looked the old house in the
          moonbeams. Never was the moon brighter; it lighted
          the far-stretching garden, it illumined even the
          weathercock aloft, it shone upon the portico, and
          upon Barbara as she had appeared in it. Stealing
          from the portico, walked Barbara, her eyes strained
          in dread affright on that grove of trees, at the
          foot of the garden. What was it that had stepped out
          of the trees, and mysteriously beckoned to her as
          she stood at the window, turning her heart to
          sickness as she gazed? Was it a human being, one to
          bring more evil on the house, where so much evil had
          already fallen; was it a supernatural visitant; or
          was it but a delusion of her own eyesight? Not the
          latter, certainly, for the figure was now emerging
          again, motioning to her as before; and, with a white
          face and shaking limbs, Barbara clutched her shawl
          round her and went down the path in the moonlight.
          The beckoning form retreated within the dark trees
          as she neared it, and Barbara halted.</p>
  <p>"Who and what are you?" she asked under her breath. "What
          do you want?"</p>
  <pb n="44"/>
  <p>"Barbara," was the whispered, eager answer, "don't you
          recognise me?"</p>
  <p>Too surely she did, the voice at any rate, and a cry
          escaped her, telling more of terror than of joy,
          though betraying both. She penetrated the trees, and
          burst into tears as one, in the dress of a farm
          labourer, caught her in his arms. In spite of his
          smock-frock and his straw-wisped hat, and his false
          whiskers, black as Erebus, she knew him for her
          brother.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard! where have you come from? What brings you
          here?"</p>
  <p>"Did you know me, Barbara?" was his rejoinder.</p>
  <p>"How was it likely—in this disguise! A thought crossed my
          mind that it might be some one from you, and even
          that made me sick with terror. How could you be so
          hazardous as to come here?" she added, wringing her
          hands. "If you are discovered, it is certain death;
          death—upon—you know!"</p>
  <p>"Upon the gallows," returned Richard Hare. "I do know it,
          Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Then why risk it? Should mamma see you, it will kill her
          outright."</p>
  <p>"I can't live on as I am living," he answered, gloomily.
          "I have been working in London ever since—"</p>
  <p>"In London!" interrupted Barbara.</p>
  <p>"In London: and have never stirred out of it. But it is
          hard work for me, and now I have an opportunity of
          doing better, if I can get a little money. Perhaps
          my mother can let me have it; it is what I have come
          to ask for."</p>
  <p>"How are you working? What at?"</p>
  <p>"In a stable-yard."</p>
  <pb n="45"/>
  <p>"A stable-yard!" she uttered, in a deeply shocked tone.
          "Richard!"</p>
  <p>"Did you expect it would be as a merchant; or a banker;
          or perhaps as secretary to one of her Majesty's
          ministers—or that I was a gentleman at large, living
          on my fortune?" retorted Richard Hare, in a tone of
          chafed anguish, painful to hear. "I get twelve
          shillings a week, Barbara, and that has to find me
          in everything."</p>
  <p>"Poor Richard! poor Richard!" she wailed, caressing his
          hand, and weeping over it. "Oh, what a miserable
          night's work that was! Our only comfort is, Richard,
          that you must have committed the deed in
          madness."</p>
  <p>"I did not commit it at all," he replied.</p>
  <p>"What!" she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, I swear that I am innocent; I swear I was not
          present when the man was murdered; I swear that,
          from my own positive knowledge, my eyesight, I know
          no more who did it than you. The guessing at it is
          enough for me; and my guess is as sure and true a
          one as that that moon is in the heavens."</p>
  <p>Barbara shivered as she drew closer to him. It was a
          shivering subject. "You surely do not mean to throw
          the guilt on Bethel?"</p>
  <p>"Bethel!" slightly returned Richard Hare. "He had nothing
          to do with it. He was after his gins and his snares
          that night, though, poacher that he is!"</p>
  <p>"Bethel is no poacher, Richard."</p>
  <p>"Is he not," rejoined Richard Hare, significantly. "The
          truth, as to what he is, may come out some time. Not
          that I wish it to come out: the man has done no harm
          to me, and he may go on poaching with <pb n="46"/>
          impunity till doomsday for all I care. He and
          Locksley—"</p>
  <p>"Richard," interrupted his sister, in a hushed voice,
          "mamma entertains one fixed idea, which she cannot
          put from her. She says she is certain Bethel had
          something to do with the murder."</p>
  <p>"Then she is wrong. Why should she think so?"</p>
  <p>"How the conviction arose at first, I cannot tell you: I
          do not think she knows herself. But you remember how
          weak and fanciful she is, and since that dreadful
          night she is always having what she calls 'dreams,'
          meaning that she dreams of the murder. In all these
          dreams Bethel is prominent; and she says she feels
          an absolute certainty that he was, in some way,
          mixed up in it."</p>
  <p>"Barbara, he was no more mixed up in it than you."</p>
  <p>"And—you say that you were not?"</p>
  <p>"I was not even at the cottage at the time; I swear it to
          you. The man who did the deed was Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Thorn!" echoed Barbara, lifting her head. "Who is
          Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know who. I wish I did: I wish I could unearth
          him. He was a friend of Afy's."</p>
  <p>Barbara threw back her neck with a haughty gesture.
          "Richard!"</p>
  <p>"What?"</p>
  <p>"You forget yourself, when you mention that name to
          me."</p>
  <p>"Well," returned Richard, "it was not to discuss these
          things that I put myself in jeopardy. And to assert
          my innocence can do no good: it cannot set aside the
          coroner's verdict of 'Wilful Murder against Richard
          Hare, the younger.' Is my father as bitter against
          me as ever?"</p>
  <pb n="47"/>
  <p>"Quite. He never mentions your name, or suffers it to be
          mentioned: he gave his orders to the servants that
          it never was to be spoken in the house again. Eliza
          could not, or would not, remember, and she persisted
          in still calling your room 'Mr. Richard's.' I think
          the woman did it heedlessly; not mischievously to
          provoke papa: she was a good servant, and had been
          with us three years, you know. The first time she
          transgressed, papa warned her; the second, he
          thundered at her, as I believe nobody else in the
          world can thunder; and the third time he turned her
          from the doors, never allowing her to get her
          bonnet: one of the others carried her bonnet and
          shawl out to the gate, and her boxes were sent away
          the same day. Papa took an oath that—Did you hear of
          it?"</p>
  <p>"What oath? He takes many."</p>
  <p>"This was a solemn one, Richard. After the delivery of
          the verdict, he took an oath in the justice-room, in
          the presence of his brother magistrates, that if he
          could find you he would deliver you up to justice,
          and that he <hi>would</hi> do it, though you might
          not turn up for ten years to come. You know his
          disposition, Richard, and therefore may be sure that
          he will keep it. Indeed, it is most dangerous for
          you to be here."</p>
  <p>"I know that he never treated me as he ought," cried
          Richard, bitterly. "If my health was delicate,
          causing my poor mother to indulge me, ought that to
          have been a reason for his ridiculing me on every
          possible occasion, public and private? Had my home
          been made happier, I should not have sought the
          society I did elsewhere. Barbara, I must be allowed
          an interview with my mother."</p>
  <pb n="48"/>
  <p>Barbara Hare reflected before she spoke. "I do not see
          how it could be managed."</p>
  <p>"Why can't she come out to me, as you have done? Is she
          up, or in bed?"</p>
  <p>"It is impossible to think of it to-night," returned
          Barbara, in an alarmed tone. "Papa may be in at any
          moment: he is spending the evening at
          Beauchamp's."</p>
  <p>"It is hard to have been separated from her for eighteen
          months, and to go back without seeing her," returned
          Richard. "And about the money? It is a hundred
          pounds that I want."</p>
  <p>"You must be here again to-morrow night, Richard: the
          money, no doubt, can be yours, but I am not so sure
          about your seeing mamma. I am terrified for your
          safety. But, if it as you say, that you are
          innocent," she added, after a pause, "could it not
          be proved?"</p>
  <p>"Who is to prove it? The evidence is strong against me:
          and Thorn, did I mention him, would be as a myth to
          other people: nobody knew anything of him."</p>
  <p>"Is he a myth?" asked Barbara, in a low tone.</p>
  <p>"Are you and I myths?" retorted Richard. "So! even
            <hi>you</hi> doubt me?"</p>
  <p>"Richard," she suddenly exclaimed, "why not tell the
          whole circumstances to Archibald Carlyle? If any one
          can help you, or take means to establish your
          innocence, he can. And you know that he is true as
          steel."</p>
  <p>"There's no other man living should be trusted with the
          secret, that I am here, except Carlyle. Where is it
          supposed that I am, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"Some think you are dead, some that you are in Australia:
          the very uncertainly has nearly killed <pb n="49"/>
          mamma. A report arose that you had been seen at
          Liverpool, in an Australian-bound ship, but we could
          not trace it to any foundation."</p>
  <p>"It had none. I dodged my way to London, and there I have
          been."</p>
  <p>"Working in a stable-yard!"</p>
  <p>"I could not do better. I was not brought up to anything;
          and I did understand horses. Besides, a man that the
          police-runners were after, could be more safe in
          obscurity, considering he was a gentleman,
          than—"</p>
  <p>Barbara turned suddenly and placed her hand upon her
          brother's mouth. "Be silent for your life," she
          whispered: "here's papa."</p>
  <p>Voices were heard approaching the gate, that of Justice
          Hare and of Squire Pinner. The latter walked on, the
          former came in. The brother and sister cowered
          together, scarcely daring to breathe: you might have
          heard Barbara's heart beating. Mr. Hare closed the
          gate, and walked on, up the path.</p>
  <p>"I must go, Richard," she hastily said; "I dare not stay
          another minute. Be here again to-morrow night, and
          meanwhile I will see what can be done."</p>
  <p>She was speeding away, but Richard held her back. "You
          did not seem to believe my assertion of innocence.
          Barbara, we are here alone in the still night, with
          God above us: as truly as that you and I must some
          time meet Him face to face, I told you truth. It was
          Thorn murdered Hallijohn, and I had nothing whatever
          to do with it."</p>
  <p>Barbara broke out of the trees and flew along, but Mr.
          Hare was already in, locking and barring the door.
          "Let me in, papa," she called out.</p>
  <pb n="50"/>
  <p>The justice opened the door again, and his flaxen wig,
          his aquiline nose, and his amazed eyes gazed at
          Barbara. "Halloa! what brings you out at this time
          of night, young lady?"</p>
  <p>"I went down to the gate to look for you," she panted,
          "and had—had—strolled over to the side path. Did you
          not see me?"</p>
  <p>Barbara was truthful by nature and habit; but, in such a
          cause, how could she avoid dissimulation? "Thank
          you, papa," she said, as she went in.</p>
  <p>"You ought to have been in bed an hour ago," angrily
          responded Mr. Justice Hare.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER V. MR. CARLYLE'S OFFICE.</head>
  <p><hi>In</hi> the centre of West Lynne stood two houses
          adjoining each other, one large, the other much
          smaller. The large one was the Carlyle residence,
          and the small one was devoted to the Carlyle
          offices. The name of Carlyle bore a lofty standing
          in the country; Carlyle and Davidson were known as
          first-class practitioners; no pettifogging lawyers
          were they. It was Carlyle and Davidson in the days
          gone by; now it was Archibald Carlyle. The old firm
          were brothers-in-law, the first Mrs. Carlyle having
          been Mr. Davidson's sister. She had died and left
          one child, Cornelia, who was grown up when her
          father married again. The second Mrs. Carlyle died
          when her son, Archibald, was born, and his
          half-sister reared him, loved him, and ruled him.
          She bore for him all the authority of a mother; the
          boy had known no other, and when a little child, he
          had called her Mamma Corny. Mamma Corny had done her
          duty by him, that was undoubted; but Mamma Corny had
          never relaxed her rule; with an iron hand she liked
          to rule him now, in great things as in small, just
          as she had done in the days of his babyhood. And
          Archibald generally submitted, for the force of
          habit is strong. She was a woman of strong sense,
          but, in <pb n="52"/> some things, weak of judgment:
          and the ruling passions of her were love of
          Archibald, and love of saving money. Mr. Davidson
          had died earlier than Mr. Carlyle, and his
          fortune—he had never married—was left equally
          divided between Cornelia and Archibald. Archibald
          was no blood relation to him, but he loved the
          open-hearted boy better than he did his niece
          Cornelia. Of Mr. Carlyle's property, a small portion
          only was bequeathed to his daughter, the rest to his
          son: and in this perhaps there was justice, since
          the £20,000 brought to Mr. Carlyle by his second
          wife, had been chiefly instrumental in the
          accumulation of his large fortune.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle, or, as she was called in the town, Miss
          Corny, had never married; it was pretty certain she
          never would; people thought that her intense love of
          her young brother kept her single, for it was not
          likely that the daughter of the rich Mr. Carlyle had
          wanted for offers. Other maidens confess to soft and
          tender impressions; to a hope of being, some time or
          another, solicited to abandon their father's name,
          and become somebody's better half. Not so Miss
          Carlyle: all who had approached her with the
          love-lorn tale, she sent quickly to the right-about.
          The last venture was from the new curate, and
          occurred when she was in her fortieth year. He made
          his appearance at her house one morning betimes, in
          his white Sunday necktie, and a pair of new gloves
          drawn on for the occasion, colou lavender. Miss
          Corny, who was an exceedingly active housekeeper in
          her own house, a great deal more so than the
          servants liked, had just been giving her orders for
          dinner. They comprised, amongst other things, a
          treacle-pudding for the kitchen, and she went
          herself <pb n="53"/> to the store-closet with a
          basin, to lade out the necessary treacle. The closet
          opened from the dining-room, and it was while she
          was in it that the curate was ushered in. Miss
          Carlyle, who completely ignored ceremony, and had
          never stood upon it in her life, came out, basin of
          treacle in hand, which she deposited on the table
          while she disposed herself to the listen to the
          reverend gentleman, who was twelve years her junior,
          and very diffident, so that he was some time getting
          his business out. Miss Corny wished him and his
          stammering somewhere, for she knew the pudding was
          waiting for the treacle, and helped him out as much
          as she could, putting in words when he seemed at
          fault for them. She supposed he wanted her name to
          some subscription, and she stood looking down at him
          with impatience, he being at least a foot shorter
          than she. When the starting truth at length
          disclosed itself, that he had come begging for
            <hi>her</hi> , and not for money, Miss Carlyle for
          once lost her temper. She screamed out that he ought
          to be ashamed of himself for a raw boy as he was,
          and she flung the contents of the basin over his
          spotless shirt-front. How the crestfallen divine got
          out of the house and down West Lynne to his
          lodgings, he never cared to recal. Sundry juveniles
          of both sexes, nursing babies or carrying out
          parcels, collected at his heels and escorted him,
          openly surmising, with various degrees of envy, that
          he had been caught dipping his head for a sly lick
          into the grocer's treacle-barrel, and the indignant
          owner had soused him in. The story got wind, and
          Miss Corny was not troubled with any more
          offers.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was seated in his own private room in his
          office the morning after his return from town. His
          confidential clerk and manager stood near him, one
          who <pb n="54"/> had far more to do with the
          management than Mr. Carlyle himself. It was Mr.
          Dill, a little, meek-looking man with a bald head.
          He was on the rolls, had been admitted years and
          years ago, but had never set up for himself: perhaps
          he deemed the post of head manager in the office of
          Carlyle and Davidson, with its substantial salary,
          sufficient for his ambition; and manager he had been
          to them when the present Mr. Carlyle was in long
          petticoats. He was a single man, and occupied
          handsome apartments near: a shrewd surmise obtained
          weight in West Lynne that he was a devoted admirer
          of Miss Carlyle, humbly worshipping her at a
          distance. Whether this was so, or not certain it is
          that he was very fond of his present master, Mr.
          Archibald, as he generally styled him. He was now
          giving an account of what had transpired during the
          few days of absence.</p>
  <p>"Jones and Rushworth have come to an outbreak at last,"
          cried he, when he had pretty nearly arrived at the
          end of his catalogue, "and the upshot will be an
          action at the summer assizes. They were both here
          yesterday, one after the other, each wanting you to
          act for him, and will be here to-day for an
          answer."</p>
  <p>"I will not act for either," said Mr. Carlyle; "I will
          have nothing to do with them. They are a bad lot,
          and it was an iniquitous piece of business their
          obtaining the money in the first instance. When
          rogues fall out, honest men get their own. I decline
          it altogether: let them carry themselves to somebody
          else."</p>
  <p>"Very good," replied Mr. Dill.</p>
  <p>"Colonel Bethel's here, sir," said a clerk, opening the
          door and addressing Mr. Carlyle. "Can you see
          him?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill turned round to the clerk. "Ask the <pb n="55"/>
          colonel to wait. I think that's about all," he added
          to his master, as the man withdrew.</p>
  <p>"Very well. Dill, certain papers will be down in a few
          days, relating to mortgages and claims on the East
          Lynne estate; they are coming with the title-deeds.
          I want them carefully looked over <hi>by you</hi> ,
          and nothing said."</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill gave a quiet nod.</p>
  <p>"East Lynne is about to change hands. And, in purchasing
          property from an embarrassed man like Mount Severn,
          it is necessary to be keen and cautious," continued
          Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It is. Has he come to the end of his tether?"</p>
  <p>"Not far short of it, I fancy; but East Lynne will be
          disposed of <hi>sub rosâ</hi> . Not a syllable
          abroad, you understand."</p>
  <p>"All right, Mr. Archibald. Who is the purchaser? It is a
          fine property."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle smiled. "You will know who, long before the
          world does. Examine the deeds with a Jew's eye. And
          now send in Bethel."</p>
  <p>Between the room of Mr. Carlyle and that of the clerk's
          was a small square space, or hall, having ingress
          also from the house passage; another room opened
          from it, a narrow one, which was Mr. Dill's own
          peculiar sanctum. Here he saw clients when Mr.
          Carlyle was out or engaged, and here he issued
          private orders. A little window, not larger than a
          pane of glass, looked out from it on the clerks'
          office; they called it Old Dill's peep-hole, and
          wished it anywhere else, for his spectacles might be
          discerned at it more often than was agreeable. The
          old gentleman had a desk also in their office, and
          there he frequently sat. He was sitting <pb n="56"/>
          there in state, this same morning, keeping a sharp
          look-out around him, when the door timidly opened,
          and the pretty face of Barbara Hare appeared at it,
          rosy with blushes.</p>
  <p>"Can I see Mr. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill rose from his seat and shook hands with her. She
          drew him into the passage, and he closed the door.
          Perhaps he felt surprised, for it was <hi>not</hi>
          the custom for ladies, young and single, to come
          there after Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Presently, Miss Barbara. He is engaged just now. The
          justices are with him."</p>
  <p>"The justices!" uttered Barbara, in alarm, "and papa one?
          Whatever shall I do? He must not see me: I would not
          have him see me here for the world."</p>
  <p>An ominous sound of talking: the justices were evidently
          coming forth. Mr. Dill laid hold of Barbara, whisked
          her through the clerks' room, not daring to take her
          the other way lest he should encounter them, and
          shut her in his own. "What brought papa here at this
          moment?" thought Barbara, whose face was
          crimson.</p>
  <p>A few minutes and Mr. Dill opened the door again. "They
          are gone now, and the coast's clear, Miss
          Barbara."</p>
  <p>"I don't know what opinion you must form of me, Mr.
          Dill," she whispered, "but I will tell you in
          confidence that I am here on some business for
          mamma, who was not well enough to come herself. It
          is a little private matter that she does not wish
          papa to know of."</p>
  <p>"Child," answered the manager, "a lawyer receives visits
          from many people; and it is not the place of those
          about him to 'think.'"</p>

  <p>He opened the door as he spoke, ushered her into the
          presence of Mr. Carlyle, and left her. The latter
          rose in astonishment.</p>
  <p>"You must regard me as a client, and pardon the
          intrusion," said Barbara, with a forced laugh to
          hide her agitation. "I am here on the part of mamma:
          and I nearly met papa in your passage, which
          terrified me out of my senses. Mr. Dill shut me into
          his room."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle motioned to Barbara to seat herself, and then
          resumed his own seat, beside his table. Barbara
          could not avoid noticing how different his manners
          were in his office, from his evening manners when he
          was "off duty." Here he was the staid, calm man of
          business.</p>
  <p>"I have a strange thing to tell you," she began, in a
          whisper, "but—is it impossible that any one can hear
          us?" she broke off, with a look of dread. "It would
          be—it might be—death."</p>
  <p>"It is quite impossible," calmly replied Mr. Carlyle.
          "The doors are double doors: did you not notice that
          they were?"</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, she left her chair, and stood close to Mr.
          Carlyle, resting her hand upon the table. He rose,
          of course.</p>
  <p>"Richard is here."</p>
  <p>"Richard!" repeated Mr. Carlyle. "At West Lynne!"</p>
  <p>"He appeared at the house last night in disguise, and
          made signs to me from the grove of trees. You may
          imagine my alarm. He has been in London all this
          while, half starving, working—I feel ashamed to
          mention it to you—in a stable-yard. And oh,
          Archibald! he says he is innocent."</p>
  <pb n="58"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle made no reply to this: he probably had no
          faith in the assertion. "Sit down, Barbara," he
          said, drawing her chair closer.</p>
  <p>Barbara sat down again, but her manner was hurried and
          nervous. "Is it quite sure that no stranger will be
          coming in? It would look so peculiar to see me here.
          But mamma was too unwell to come herself—or, rather,
          she feared papa's questioning, if he found out that
          she came."</p>
  <p>"Be at ease," replied Mr. Carlyle: "this room is sacred
          from the intrusion of strangers. What of
          Richard?"</p>
  <p>"He says that he was not in the cottage at the time the
          murder was committed. That the person who really did
          it was a man of the name of Thorn."</p>
  <p>"What Thorn?" asked Mr. Carlyle, suppressing all sign of
          incredulity.</p>
  <p>"I don't know: a friend of Afy's, he said. Archibald, he
          swore to it in the most solemn manner: and I
          believe, as truly as that I am now repeating it to
          you, that he was speaking truth. I want you to see
          Richard, if possible: he is coming to the same place
          to-night. If he can tell his own tale to you,
          perhaps you may find out a way by which his
          innocence may be made manifest. You are so clever;
          you can do anything."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle smiled. "Not quite anything, Barbara. Was
          this the purport of Richard's visit—to say
          this?"</p>
  <p>"Oh no: he thinks it is of no use to say it, for nobody
          would believe him against the evidence. He came to
          ask for a hundred pounds; he say he has an
          opportunity of doing better, if he can have that
          sum. Mamma has sent me to you: she has not the money
          by her, and she dare not ask papa for it, as it is
          for <pb n="59"/> Richard. She bade me say that if
          you will kindly oblige her with the money to-day,
          she will arrange with you about the repayment."</p>
  <p>"Do you want it now?" asked Mr. Carlyle. "If so, I must
          send to the bank. Dill never keeps much in the house
          when I am away."</p>
  <p>"Not until evening. Can you manage to see Richard?"</p>
  <p>"It is hazardous," mused Mr. Carlyle: "for him, I mean.
          Still, if he is to be in the grove to-night, I may
          as well be there also. What disguise is he in?"</p>
  <p>"A farm labourer's; the best he could adopt about here,
          with large black whiskers. He is stopping about
          three miles off, he said, in some obscure
          hiding-place. And now," continued Barbara, "I want
          you to advise me: had I better inform mamma that
          Richard is here, or not?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle did not understand: and said so.</p>
  <p>"I declare I am bewildered," she exclaimed. "I should
          have premised that I have not yet told mamma it is
          Richard himself who is here: but that he had sent a
          messenger to beg for this money. Would it be
          advisable to acquaint her?"</p>
  <p>"Why should you not? I think you ought to do so."</p>
  <p>"Then I will. I was fearing the hazard, for she is sure
          to insist upon seeing him. Richard also wishes for
          an interview."</p>
  <p>"It is only natural. Mrs. Hare must be thankful to hear,
          so far, that he is safe."</p>
  <p>"I never saw anything like it," returned Barbara; "the
          change is akin to magic: she says it has put life
          into her anew. And now for the last thing: how can
            <pb n="60"/> we secure papa's absence from home
          to-night? It must be accomplished in some way. You
          know his temper: were I or mamma to suggest to him
          to go and see any friend, or to go to the club, he
          would immediately stop at home. Can you devise any
          plan? You see I appeal to you in all my troubles,"
          she added, "as I and Anne used to do, when we were
          children."</p>
  <p>It may be questioned if Mr. Carlyle heard the last
          remark. He had drooped his eyelids in thought. "Have
          you told me all?" he asked presently, lifting
          them.</p>
  <p>"I think so."</p>
  <p>"Then I will consider it over, and—"</p>
  <p>"I shall not like to come here again," interrupted
          Barbara. "It—it—might excite suspicion; some one
          might see me, too, and mention it to papa. Neither
          ought you to send to our house."</p>
  <p>"Well—contrive to be in the street at four this
          afternoon. Stay, that's your dinner-hour; be walking
          up the street at three, three precisely; I will meet
          you."</p>
  <p>He rose, shook hands, and escorted Barbara through the
          small hall, along the passage to the house door: a
          courtesy probably not yet shown to any client, by
          Mr. Carlyle. The door closed upon her, and Barbara
          had taken one step from it, when something large
          loomed down upon her, like a ship in full sail.</p>
  <p>She must have been the tallest lady in the world— out of
          a caravan. A fine woman in her day, but angular and
          bony now. Still, in spite of the angles and the
          bones, there was majesty in the appearance of Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Why—what on earth!" began she—"have <hi>you</hi> been
          with Archibald?"</p>
  <pb n="61"/>
  <p>Barbara Hare stammered out the excuse she had given Mr.
          Dill.</p>
  <p>"Your mamma sent you on business! I never heard of such a
          thing. Twice have I been in to see Archibald, and
          twice did Dill answer that he was engaged and must
          not be interrupted. I shall make old Dill explain
          his meaning for observing a mystery to me."</p>
  <p>"There is no mystery," answered Barbara, feeling quite
          sick lest Miss Carlyle should proclaim there was,
          before the clerks, or to her father. "Mamma wanted
          Mr. Carlyle's opinion upon a little private
          business, and, not feeling well enough to come
          herself, she sent me."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle did not believe a word. "What business?"
          asked she, unceremoniously.</p>
  <p>"It is nothing that could interest you. A trifling
          matter, relating to a little money. It's nothing,
          indeed."</p>
  <p>"Then, if it's nothing, why were you closeted so long
          with Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"He was asking the particulars," replied Barbara,
          recovering her equanimity.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle sniffed: as she invariably did, when
          dissenting from a problem. She was sure there was
          some mystery astir. She turned and walked down the
          street with Barbara, but she was none the more
          likely to get anything out of her.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle returned to his room, deliberated a few
          moments, and then rang his bell. A clerk answered
          it.</p>
  <p>"Go to the Buck's Head. If Mr. Hare and the other
          magistrates are there, ask them to step over to
          me."</p>
  <pb n="62"/>
  <p>The young man did as he was bid, and came back with the
          noted justices as his heels. They obeyed the summons
          with alacrity: for they believed they had got
          themselves into a judicial scrape, and that Mr.
          Carlyle alone could get them out of it.</p>
  <p>"I will not request you to sit down," began Mr. Carlyle,
          "for it is barely a moment I shall detain you. The
          more I think about this man's having been put in
          prison, the less I like it; and I have been
          considering that you had better, all five, come and
          smoke your pipes at my house this evening, when we
          shall have time to discuss what must be done. Come
          at seven, not later; and you will find my father's
          old jar replenished with the best broad-cut, and
          half a dozen churchwarden pipes. Shall it be
          so?"</p>
  <p>The whole five accepted the invitation eagerly. And they
          were filing out, when Mr. Carlyle laid his finger on
          the arm of Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>" <hi>You</hi> will be sure to come, Mr. Hare," he
          whispered. "We could not get on without you: all
          heads," with a slight inclination towards those
          going out, "are not gifted with the clear good sense
          of yours."</p>
  <p>"Sure and certain," responded the gratified justice:
          "fire and water shouldn't keep me away."</p>
  <p>Soon after Mr. Carlyle was left alone, another clerk
          entered. "Miss Carlyle is asking to see you, sir,
          and Colonel Bethel's come again."</p>
  <p>"Send in Miss Carlyle first," was the answer. "What is
          it, Cornelia?"</p>
  <p>"Ah! You may well ask what! Saying this morning that you
          could not dine at six, as usual, and then marching
          off, and never fixing the hour. How can I give my
          orders?"</p>
  <pb n="63"/>
  <p>"I thought business would have called me out, but I am
          not going now. We will dine a little earlier,
          Cornelia; say a quarter before six. I have
          invit—"</p>
  <p>"What's up, Archibald?" interrupted Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Up! Nothing, that I know of. I am very busy, Cornelia,
          and Colonel Bethel is waiting; I will talk to you at
          dinner time."</p>
  <p>In reply to this plain hint, Miss Carlyle deliberately
          seated herself in the client's chair, and crossed
          her legs, her shoes and her white stockings in full
          view: for Miss Corny disdained long dresses as much
          as she disdained crinoline; or, as the inflating
          machines were called then, corded petticoats,
          crinoline not having come in. "I mean, what's up at
          the Hares', that Barbara should come here and be
          closeted with you? Business for her mother, she
          said."</p>
  <p>"Why, you know the mess that Hare and the other justices
          have got into; committing that poor fellow to
          prison, because he was seen to pull up a weed in his
          garden on the Sunday," returned Mr. Carlyle, after
          an almost imperceptible pause. "Mrs. Hare—"</p>
  <p>"A set of bumber-headed old donkeys!" was the
          complimentary interruption of Miss Carlyle. "The
          whole bench have not an ounce of sense between
          them."</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Hare is naturally anxious for my opinion, for there
          may be some trouble over it, the man having appealed
          to the Secretary of State. She was too ill, Barbara
          said, to come to me herself. Cornelia, I have
          invited a party for to-night."</p>
  <p>"A party!" echoed Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Four or five of the justices; they are coming in to <pb n="64"/> smoke their pipes. You must put out my
          father's leaden tobacco-box, and—"</p>
  <p>"They shan't come," screamed Miss Carlyle. "Do you think
          I'll be poisoned with tobacco-smoke from a
          dozen-pipes?"</p>
  <p>"You need not sit in the room."</p>
  <p>"Nor they either. Clean curtains are just put up
          throughout the house, and I'll have no horrid pipes
          to blacken them."</p>
  <p>"Cornelia," returned Mr. Carlyle, in a grave, firm tone,
          which, opinionated as she was, never failed in its
          effect upon her, "my having them is a matter of
          business; of business, you understand; and, come
          they must. If you object to their being in the
          sitting-rooms, they must be in my bed-room."</p>
  <p>The word "business" always bore for Miss Carlyle one
          meaning, that of money-making. Mr. Carlyle knew her
          weak point, and sometimes played upon it, when he
          could gain his end by no other means. Her love for
          money amounted almost to a passion; to acquire it,
          or to hear that he was acquiring it, was very dear
          to her. The same could not be said of him: many and
          many a dispute, that would have brought him in
          pounds and pounds, had it gone on to an action, did
          he labour to soothe down; and had reconciled his
          litigants by his plain, sincere advice.</p>
  <p>"I'll buy you some new curtains, Cornelia, if their pipes
          spoil these," he quietly resumed. "And I really must
          beg you to leave me."</p>
  <p>"When I have come to the bottom of this affair with
          Barbara Hare," resolutely returned Miss Corny,
          dropping the point of contest as to the pipes. "You
          are very clever, Archie, but you can't deceive me. I
          asked <pb n="65"/> Barbara what she came here for:
          business for her mamma, touching money matters, was
          her reply. I ask you: to hear your opinion about the
          scrape the bench have got into, is yours. Now, it's
          neither one nor the other, and I tell you,
          Archibald, I'll hear what it is. I should like to
          know what you and Barbara do with a secret between
          you."</p>
  <p>She sat bolt upright in her chair and stared at him, her
          lofty figure drawn to its full height. Not in
          features were they alike; some resemblance, perhaps,
          there might be in the expanse of the forehead and
          the way in which the hair grew, arched from the
          temples: Miss Carlyle's hair was going grey now, and
          she wore it in curls which were rarely smooth,
          fastened back by combs which were rarely in their
          places. Her face was pale, well-shaped, and
          remarkable for nothing but a hard, decisive
          expression, her eyes, wide open and penetrating,
          were of the shade called "green." But, though she
          could not boast her brother's good looks, there were
          many plainer women in West Lynne than Cornelia
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle knew her and her resolute expression well,
          and he took his course, to tell her the truth. She
          was, to borrow the words Barbara had used to her
          brother with regard to him, true as steel. Confide
          to Miss Carlyle a secret, and she was trustworthy
          and impervious as he could be: but, let her once
          suspect that there was a secret which was being kept
          from her, and she would set to work like a ferret,
          and never stop till it was unearthed.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle bent forward and spoke in a whisper. "I will
          tell you if you wish, Cornelia, but it is not a
          pleasant thing to hear. Richard Hare has
          returned."</p>
  <pb n="66"/>
  <p>Miss Carlyle looked perfectly aghast. "Richard Hare! Is
          he mad?"</p>
  <p>"It is not a very sane proceeding. He wants money from
          his mother, and Mrs. Hare sent Barbara to ask me to
          manage it for her. No wonder poor Barbara was
          flurried and nervous, for there's danger on all
          sides."</p>
  <p>"Is he at their house?"</p>
  <p>"How could he be there, and his father in it? He is in
          hiding two or three miles off, disguised as a
          labourer, and will be at the Grove to-night to
          receive this money. I have invited the justices, to
          get Mr. Hare safe away from his own house: if he saw
          Richard, he would undoubtedly give him up to
          justice, and—putting graver considerations
          aside—that would be pleasant neither for you nor for
          me. To have a connexion hanged for wilful murder,
          would be an ugly blot on the Carlyle escutcheon,
          Cornelia."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle sat in silence, revolving the news, a
          contraction on her ample brow.</p>
  <p>"And now you know all, Cornelia, and I do beg you to
          leave me, for I am overwhelmed with work today."</p>
  <p>She rose without a word, passed out, and left her brother
          in peace. He snatched up a note, the first
          apparently that lay to hand, put it in an envelope,
          sealed and addressed it to himself. Then he called
          in Mr. Dill, and gave it to him. The latter looked
          in surprise at the superscription.</p>
  <p>"At eight o'clock to-night, Dill, bring this to my house.
          Don't send it in, ask for me. You understand."</p>
  <p>The old gentleman replied by a nod, and put the note in
          his pocket.</p>
  <pb n="67"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was walking down the street at three o'clock
          that afternoon, when he met Barbara Hare. "It is all
          arranged," he said to her in passing. "I entertain
          the bench of justices to-night, Barbara, to pipes
          and ale, Mr. Hare being one."</p>
  <p>She looked up in doubt. "Then—if you entertain them, you
          will not be able to come and meet Richard."</p>
  <p>"Trust to me," was all his answer, as he hurried on.</p>
  <pb n="68"/>
                                </div>

  <head>CHAPTER VI. RICHARD HARE, THE YOUNGER.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> bench of justices did not fail to keep their
          appointment: at seven o'clock they arrived at Miss
          Carlyle's, one following closely upon the heels of
          another. The reader may dissent from the expression
          "Miss Carlyle's," but it is the correct one, for the
          house was hers, not her brother's. Though it
          remained his home, as it had been in his father's
          time, the house was amongst the property bequeathed
          to Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle chose to be present, in spite of the pipes
          and the smoke, and she was soon as deep in the
          discussion as the justices were. It was said in the
          town that she was as good a lawyer as her father had
          been: she undoubtedly possessed sound judgment in
          legal matters, and quick penetration. At eight
          o'clock a servant entered the room and addressed his
          master.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Dill is asking to see you, sir."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle rose, and came back with an open note in his
          hand.</p>
  <p>"I am sorry to find that I must leave you for half an
          hour. Some important business has arisen, but I will
          be back as soon as I can."</p>
  <p>"Who has sent for you?" immediately demanded Miss
          Corny.</p>
  <pb n="69"/>
  <p>He gave her a quiet look, which she interpreted into a
          warning not to question. "Mr. Dill is here, and will
          join you to talk the affair over," he said to his
          guests. "He knows the law better than I do: but I
          shall not be long."</p>
  <p>He quitted his house, and walked with a rapid step
          towards the Grove. The moon was bright, as on the
          previous evening. After he had left the town behind
          him, and was passing the scattered villas already
          mentioned, he cast an involuntary glance at the
          wood, which rose behind them on his left hand. It
          was called Abbey Wood, from the circumstance that in
          old days an abbey had stood in its vicinity, all
          trace of which, save tradition, had long passed
          away. There was one small house, or cottage, just
          within the wood, and in that cottage had occurred
          the murder for which Richard Hare's life was in
          jeopardy. It was no longer occupied, for nobody
          would rent it or live in it.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle opened the gate of the Grove, and glanced at
          the trees on either side him, but he neither saw nor
          heard any signs of Richard's being concealed there.
          Barbara was at the window, looking out, and she came
          herself and opened the door to Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Mamma is in the most excited state," she whispered to
          him as he entered. "I knew how it would be."</p>
  <p>"Has he come yet?"</p>
  <p>"I have no doubt of it, but he has made no signal."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare, feverish and agitated, with a burning spot on
          her delicate cheeks, stood by her chair, not
          occupying it. Mr. Carlyle placed a pocket-book in
          her hands. "I have brought it chiefly in notes," he
          said, "they will be easier for him to carry than
          gold."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare answered only by a look of gratitude, and <pb n="70"/> clasped Mr. Carlyle's hand in both of
          hers. "Archibald, I <hi>must</hi> see my boy; how
          can it be managed? Must I go into the garden to him,
          or may he come in here?"</p>
  <p>"I think he might come in; you know how very bad the
          night air is for you. Are the servants astir much
          this evening?"</p>
  <p>"Things seem to have turned out quite kindly," said
          Barbara. "It happens to be Anne's brithday, so mamma
          sent me just now into the kitchen with a cake and a
          bottle of wine, desiring them to drink her health. I
          shut the door and told them to make themselves
          comfortable; that if we wanted anything, we would
          ring."</p>
  <p>"Then they are safe," observed Mr. Carlyle, "and Richard
          may come in."</p>
  <p>"I will go and ascertain whether he is come," said
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Stay where you are, Barbara, I will go myself,"
          interposed Mr. Carlyle. "Have the door open when you
          see us coming up the path."</p>
  <p>Barbara gave a faint cry, and, trembling, clutched the
          arm of Mr. Carlyle. "There he is! See: standing out
          from the trees, just opposite this window."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle turned to Mrs. Hare. "I shall not bring him
          in immediately. For, if I am to have an interview
          with him, it must be got over first, that I may go
          back home to the justices, and keep Mr. Hare all
          safe."</p>
  <p>He proceeded on his way, gained the trees, and plunged
          into them; and, leaning against one, stood Richard
          Hare. Apart from his disguise, and the false and
          fierce black whiskers, he was a blue-eyed, fair,
          pleasant-looking young man, slight, and of middle
            <pb n="71"/> height, and quite as yielding and
          gentle as his mother. In her, his mild yieldingness
          of disposition was rather a graceful quality; in
          Richard it was regarded as a contemptible
          misfortune. In his boyhood he had been nicknamed
          Leafy Dick, and when a stranger inquired why, the
          answer was, that as a leaf is swayed by the wind, so
          he was swayed by everybody about him, never
          possessing a will of his own. In short, Richard
          Hare, though of an amiable, loving nature, was not
          overburdened with what the world calls brains.
          Brains he certainly had, but they were not sharp
          ones.</p>
  <p>"Is my mother coming out to me?" asked Richard, after a
          few interchanged sentences with Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"No. You are to go in-doors. Your father is away, and the
          servants are shut up in the kitchen and will not see
          you. Though if they did, they could never recognise
          you in that trim. A fine pair of whiskers,
          Richard."</p>
  <p>"Let us go in, then. I am all in a twitter till I get
          away. Am I to have the money?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, yes. But, Richard, your sister says you wish to
          disclose to me the true history of that lamentable
          night. You had better speak while we are here."</p>
  <p>"It was Barbara who wanted you to hear it; I think it of
          little moment. If the whole place heard the truth
          from me, it would do no good, for I should get no
          belief: not even from you."</p>
  <p>"Try me, Richard: in as few words as possible."</p>
  <p>"Well—there was a row at home about my going so much to
          Hallijohn's. The governor and my mother thought I
          went after Afy: perhaps I did, perhaps I didn't.
          Hallijohn had asked me to lend him my gun, <pb n="72"/> and that evening, when I went to see
          Af—when I went to see some one—never mind—"</p>
  <p>"Richard," interrupted Mr. Carlyle," there's an old
          saying, and it is sound advice, 'Tell the whole
          truth to your lawyer and your doctor.' If I am to
          judge whether anything can be attempted for you, you
          must tell it to me; otherwise, I would rather hear
          nothing. It shall be sacred trust."</p>
  <p>"Then, if I must, I must," returned the yielding Richard.
          "I did love the girl; I would have waited till I was
          my own master to make her my wife, though it had
          been for years and years. I could not do it, you
          know, in the face of my father's opposition."</p>
  <p>"Your wife?" rejoined Mr. Carlyle, with some
          emphasis.</p>
  <p>Richard looked surprised. "Why, you don't suppose I meant
          anything else! I wouldn't have been such a
          blackguard."</p>
  <p>"Well, go on, Richard. Did she return your love?"</p>
  <p>"I can't be certain. Sometimes I thought she did,
          sometimes not; she used to play and shuffle, and she
          liked too much to be with—him. I thought her
          capricious—telling me I must not come this evening,
          and I must not come the other; but I found out they
          were the evenings she expected him. We were never
          there together."</p>
  <p>"You forget that you have not indicated 'him' by any
          name, Richard. I am at fault."</p>
  <p>Richard, Hare bent forward till his black whiskers
          brushed Mr. Carlyle's shoulder. "It was that cursed
          Thorn."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle remembered the name Barbara had <pb n="73"/>
          mentioned. "Who was Thorn? I never heard of
          him."</p>
  <p>"Neither did anybody else, I expect, in West Lynne. He
          took precious good care of that. He lived some miles
          away, and use to come over in secret."</p>
  <p>"Courting Afy?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, he did come courting her," returned Richard, in a
          savage tone. "Distance was no barrier. He would come
          galloping over at dusk, tie his horse to a tree in
          the wood, and pass an hour or two with Afy. In the
          house, when her father was not at home; roaming
          about the wood with her, when he was."</p>
  <p>"Come to the point, Richard: to the evening."</p>
  <p>"Hallijohn's gun was out of order, and he requested the
          loan of mine. I had made an appointment with Afy to
          be at her house that evening, and I went down after
          dinner, carrying the gun with me. My father called
          after me to know where I was going: I said, out with
          young Beauchamp, not caring to meet with his
          opposition; and the lie told against me at the
          inquest. When I reached Hallijohn's, going the back
          way along the fields and through the wood path as I
          generally did go, Afy came out, all reserve, as she
          could be at times, and said she was unable to
          receive me then, that I must go back home. We had a
          few words about it, and as we were speaking,
          Locksley passed, and saw me with the gun in my hand;
          I gave way to her, she could do just what she liked
          with me, for I loved the very ground she trod on. I
          gave her the gun, telling her it was loaded, and she
          took it in-doors, shutting me out. I did not go
          away; I had a suspicion that she had got Thorn
          there, though she denied it to me; and I hid myself
          in some trees near the house. Again Locksley came in
            <pb n="74"/> view and saw me there, and called out
          to know why I was hiding. I went farther off, and
          did not answer him—what were my private movements to
          him?—and that also told against me at the inquest.
          Not long afterwards, twenty minutes, perhaps, I
          heard a shot, which seemed to be in the direction of
          the cottage. 'Somebody having a late pop at the
          partridges,' thought I: for the sun was then
          setting, and at the moment I saw Bethel emerge from
          the trees, and run in the direction of the cottage.
          That was the shot that killed Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Mr. Carlyle looked keenly at Richard
          Hare in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>"Very soon, almost in the same minute, as it seemed, one
          came panting and tearing along the path leading from
          the cottage. It was Thorn. His appearance startled
          me: I had never seen a man show more utter terror.
          His face was livid, his eyes seemed starting, and
          his lips were drawn back from his teeth. Had I been
          a strong man, I should surely have attacked him; I
          was mad with jealousy; for I then saw that Afy had
          sent me away that she might entertain him."</p>
  <p>"I thought you said this Thorn never came but at dusk?"
          observed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I never knew him to do so until that evening. All I can
          say is, he was there then. He flew along swiftly,
          and I afterwards heard the sound of his horse's
          hoofs, galloping away. I wondered what was up, that
          he should look so scared; I wondered whether he had
          quarrelled with Afy. I ran to the house, leaped up
          the two steps, and—Carlyle—I fell over the prostrate
          body of Hallijohn! He was lying just within, on the
          kitchen floor, dead. Blood was round about him, and
          my gun, <pb n="75"/> just discharged, was thrown
          near: he had been shot in the side."</p>
  <p>Richard stopped for breath. Mr. Carlyle did not
          speak.</p>
  <p>"I called to Afy. No one answered. No one was in the
          lower rooms; and it seemed that no one was in the
          upper. A sort of panic came over me, a fear: you
          know they always said at home I was a coward: I
          could not have remained another minute with that
          dead man, had it been to save my own life. I caught
          up the gun, and was making off, when—"</p>
  <p>"Why did you catch up the gun?" interrupted Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Ideas pass through our minds quicker than we can speak
          them, especially in these sort of moments," was the
          reply of Richard Hare. "Some vague notion flashed on
          my brain that <hi>my gun</hi> ought not to be found
          near the murdered body of Hallijohn. I was flying
          from the door, I say, when Locksley emerged from the
          wood, full in view, and, what possessed me I can't
          tell, but I did the worst thing I could do—flung the
          gun in-doors again, and got away, although Locksley
          called after me to stop."</p>
  <p>"Nothing told so much against you as that," observed Mr.
          Carlyle. "Locksley deposed that he had seen you
          leave the cottage, gun in hand, apparently in great
          commotion; that the moment you saw him, you
          hesitated, as from fear, flung back the gun, and
          escaped."</p>
  <p>Richard stamped his foot. "Ay; and all owing to my cursed
          cowardice. They had better have made a woman of me,
          and brought me up in petticoats. But let me go on. I
          came upon Bethel: he was standing <pb n="76"/> in
          that half-circle where the trees have been cut. Now
          I knew that Bethel, if he had gone straight in the
          direction of the cottage, must have met Thorn
          quitting it. 'Did you encounter that hound?' I asked
          him. 'What hound?' returned Bethel. 'That fine
          fellow, that Thorn, who comes after Afy,' I
          answered, for I did not mind mentioning her name in
          my passion. 'I don't know any Thorn,' returned
          Bethel, 'and I did not know anybody was after Afy,
          but yourself.' 'Did you hear a shot?' I went on.
          'Yes I did,' he replied; 'I suppose it was Locksley,
          for he's about this evening.' 'And I saw you,' I
          continued, 'just in the moment the shot was fired,
          turn round the corner in the direction of
          Hallijohn's.' 'So I did,' he said, 'but only to
          strike into the wood, a few paces up. What's your
          drift?' 'Did you not encounter Thorn, running from
          the cottage?' I persisted. 'I have encountered no
          one,' he said, 'and I don't believe anybody's about
          but ourselves and Locksley.' I quitted him and came
          off," concluded Richard Hare; "he evidently had not
          seen Thorn, and knew nothing."</p>
  <p>"And you decamped the same night, Richard. It was a fatal
          step."</p>
  <p>"Yes, I was a fool. I thought I'd wait quiet, and see how
          things turned out: but you don't know all. Three or
          four hours later, I went to the cottage again, and I
          managed to get a minute's speech with Afy. I never
          shall forget it; before I could say a syllable she
          flew out at me, accusing me of being the murderer of
          her father, and she fell into hysterics out there on
          the grass. The noise brought people from the house—
          plenty were in it then—and I retreated. 'If
            <hi>she</hi> can think me guilty, the world will
          think me guilty,' was <pb n="77"/> my argument, and
          that night I went right off, to stop in hiding for a
          day or two, till I saw my way clear. It never came
          clear: the coroner's inquest sat, and the verdict
          floored me for ever. And Afy—but I won't curse
          her—fanned the flame against me, by denying that any
          one had been there that night. She had been at home
          alone, she said, and had strolled out at the back
          door, to the path that led from West Lynne, and was
          lingering there when she heard a shot. Five minutes
          afterwards she returned to the house, and found
          Locksley standing over her dead father."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle remained silent, rapidly running over in his
          mind the chief points of Richard Hare's
          communication. "Four of you, as I understand it,
          were in the vicinity of the cottage that night, and
          from one or other the shot no doubt proceeded. You
          were at a distance, you say, Richard; Bethel also
          could not have been—"</p>
  <p>"It was not Bethel who did it," interrupted Richard; "it
          is an impossibility. I saw him, as I tell you, in
          the same moment that the gun was fired."</p>
  <p>"But now, where was Locksley?"</p>
  <p>"It is equally impossible that it could have been
          Locksley. He was within my view at the time, at
          right angles from me, deep in the wood, away from
          the paths altogether. It was Thorn did the deed,
          beyond all doubt, and the verdict ought to have been
          wilful murder against him. Carlyle, I see you don't
          believe my story."</p>
  <p>"What you say has startled me, and I must take time to
          consider whether I believe it or not," replied Mr.
          Carlyle, in his straightforward manner. "The most
          singular thing, if you witnessed Thorn's running
          away from the cottage in the manner you <pb n="78"/>
          describe, is, that you did not come forward and
          denounce him."</p>
  <p>"I didn't do it because I was a fool, a weak coward, as I
          have been all my life," rejoined Richard. "I can't
          help it: it was born with me, and will go with me to
          my grave. What would have been my word, that it was
          Thorn, when there was nobody to corroborate it? and
          the discharged gun, mine, was a damnatory proof
          against me."</p>
  <p>"Another thing strikes me as curious," cried Mr. Carlyle.
          "If this man, Thorn, was in the habit of coming to
          West Lynne, evening after evening, how was it that
          he was never observed? This is the first time I have
          heard any stranger's name mentioned in connexion
          with the affair, or with Afy."</p>
  <p>"Thorn chose by-roads, and he never came, save that once,
          but at dusk or dark. It was evident to me at the
          time that he was courting her in secret. I told Afy
          so; and that it argued no good for her. You are not
          attaching credit to what I say, and it is only what
          I expected; nevertheless, I swear that I have
          related facts. As surely as that we—I, Thorn, Afy,
          and Hallijohn—must one day meet together before our
          Maker, I have told you truth."</p>
  <p>The words were solemn, their tone earnest, and Mr.
          Carlyle remained silent, his thoughts full.</p>
  <p>"To what end, else, should I say this?" went on Richard.
          "It can do me no service: all the assertion I could
          put forth, would not go a jot towards clearing
          me."</p>
  <p>"No, it would not," assented Mr. Carlyle. "If ever you
          are cleared, it must be by proofs. But—I <pb n="79"/> will keep my thoughts on the matter, and should
          anything arise—What sort of a man was this
          Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"In age he might have been three or four-and-twenty, tall
          and slender; an out-and-out aristocrat."</p>
  <p>"And his connections? Where did he live?"</p>
  <p>"I never knew. Afy, in her boasting way, would say he had
          to come from Swainson, a ten-mile ride."</p>
  <p>"From Swainson!" quickly interrupted Mr. Carlyle. "Could
          it be one of the Thorns of Swainson?"</p>
  <p>"None of the Thorns there that I know. He was a totally
          different man, with his perfumed hands, and his
          rings, and his dainty gloves. That he was an
          aristocrat, I believe, but of bad taste and style,
          displaying a profusion of jewellery."</p>
  <p>A half smile flitted over Mr. Carlyle's face. "Was it
          real, Richard?"</p>
  <p>"It was. He would wear diamond shirt-studs, diamond
          rings, diamond pins; brilliants, all, of the first
          water. My impression was, that he put them on to
          dazzle Afy. She told me once that she could be a
          grander lady, if she chose, than I could ever make
          her. A lady on the cross, I answered her, but never
          on the square. Thorn was not a man to entertain
          honest intentions to one in the station of Afy
          Hallijohn; but girls are as simple as geese."</p>
  <p>"By your description it could not have been one of the
          Thorns of Swainson. Wealthy tradesmen, fathers of
          young families, short, stout, and heavy as Dutchmen,
          staid and most respectable. Very unlikely men, are
          they, to run into an expedition of the sort."</p>
  <p>"What expedition?" questioned Richard. "The murder?"</p>
  <p>"The riding after Afy. Richard, where is Afy?"</p>
  <pb n="80"/>
  <p>Richard Hare lifted his face in surprise. "How should I
          know? I was just going to ask you."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle paused. He thought Richard's answer an
          evasive one. "She disappeared immediately after the
          funeral; and it was thought—in short, Richard, the
          neighbourhood gave her credit for having gone after
          and joined you."</p>
  <p>"No! did they? what a pack of idiots! I have never seen
          or heard of her, Carlyle, since that unfortunate
          night. If she went after anybody, it was after
          Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Was the man good-looking?"</p>
  <p>"I suppose the world would call him so. Afy thought such
          an Adonis had never been coined, out of fable. He
          had shiny black hair and whiskers, dark eyes and
          handsome features. But his vain dandyism spoilt
          him."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle could ascertain no more particulars, and it
          was time Richard went in-doors. They proceeded up
          the path. "What a blessing it is the servants'
          windows don't look this way," shivered Richard,
          treading on Mr. Carlyle's heels. "If they should be
          looking out, up-stairs!"</p>
  <p>His apprehensions were groundless, and he entered unseen.
          Mr. Carlyle's part was over; he left the poor banned
          exile to his short interview with his hysterical and
          tearful mother, Richard nearly as hysterical as she,
          and made the best of his way home again, pondering
          over what he had heard.</p>
  <p>Not a shadow of doubt had hitherto existed in his mind
          that George Hallijohn had met his death at the hands
          of Richard Hare. But, in defiance of the coroner's
          jury, and the universal opinion, he had never
          believed it <pb n="81"/> to be <hi>wilful</hi>
          murder. Richard was mild, kind, inoffensive, the
          last man to be guilty of cruelty, or to commit a
          deliberate crime; and Mr. Carlyle had always thought
          that, could the truth be brought to light, the fatal
          shot would be found to have been the result of an
          accident, or, at worst, a scuffle, in which the gun
          might have gone off. It was rumoured that Hallijohn
          had objected to Richard's visits to his daughter,
          and it might have come, that night, to an
          outbreak.</p>
  <p>Who was this Thorn? He certainly could not be a creation
          of Richard's inventive faculties; still, it was
          strange that his name had never been mentioned; that
          himself and his visits were unknown to the
          neighbourhood. Was the fellow an aristocrat, as
          Richard had called him, shallow-pated and
          contemptible, with his shiny hair and his bejewelled
          fingers, or was he a member of the swell mob? And
          was he in truth the real author of the murder? Be it
          as it would, sufficient food had been supplied to
          call forth all Mr. Carlyle's acumen—and he possessed
          no slight share.</p>
  <p>The magistrates made a good evening of it, Mr. Carlyle
          entertaining them to supper, mutton-chops and
          bread-and-cheese. They took up their pipes for
          another whiff when the meal was over, but Miss
          Carlyle retired to bed: the smoke, to which she had
          not been accustomed since her father's death, had
          made her head ache and her eyes smart. About eleven
          they wished Mr. Carlyle good night and departed, but
          Mr. Dill, in obedience to a nod from his superior,
          remained.</p>
  <p>"Sit down again a moment, Dill; I want to ask you a
          question. You are intimate with the Thorns of
          Swainson: do they happen to have any relative, a
          nephew, or cousin perhaps, a dandy young
          fellow?"</p>
  <pb n="82"/>
  <p>"I went over last Sunday fortnight to spend the day with
          young Jacob," was the answer of Mr. Dill, one wider
          from the point than he generally gave. Mr. Carlyle
          smiled.</p>
  <p>" <hi>Young</hi> Jacob! He must be forty, I suppose."</p>
  <p>"About that. But you and I estimate age differently, Mr.
          Archibald. They have no nephew: the old man never
          had but those two children, Jacob and Edward.
          Neither have they any cousin. Rich men they are
          growing now: Jacob has set up his carriage."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle mused, but he expected the answer, for
          neither had he heard of the brothers Thorn, tanners,
          curriers, and leather-dressers, possessing a
          relative of the name. "Dill," said he, "something
          has arisen which, in my mind, casts a doubt upon
          Richard Hare's guilt. I question whether he had
          anything to do with the murder."</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill opened his eyes. "But his flight, Mr. Archibald?
          And his stopping away?"</p>
  <p>"Suspicious circumstances, I grant: still, I have good
          cause to doubt. At the time it happened, some dandy
          fellow used to come courting Afy Hallijohn in
          secret: a tall, slender man, as he is described to
          me, bearing the name of Thorn, and living at
          Swainson. Could it have been one of the Thorn
          family?"</p>
  <p>"Mr. Archibald!" remonstrated the old clerk: "as if those
          two respected gentlemen with wives and babies, would
          come sneaking after that fly-away Afy?"</p>
  <p>"No reflection on them," returned Mr. Carlyle. "This was
          a young man, three or four-and-twenty, a head taller
          than either. I thought it might be a relative."</p>
  <p>"I have repeatedly heard them say that they are <pb n="83"/> alone in the world; that they are the two
          last of the name. Depend upon it, it was nobody
          connected with them. Who says anybody came over
          after Afy, Mr. Archibald? I never knew but of one
          doing so, and that was Richard Hare."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle could not say "Richard himself told me," so
          he left the question unanswered. "Sufficient grounds
          have been furnished me to cast a doubt upon Richard
          Hare's guilt, and to lay it upon this Thorn," he
          observed. "And I intend to institute a little
          private investigation, under the rose, and see if
          any fact can be brought to light. You must help
          me."</p>
  <p>"With all my heart," responded Mr. Dill. "Not that I
          believe it could have been any one but Richard."</p>
  <p>"The next time you go to Swainson, try and discover
          whether a young fellow named Thorn (whether
          connected with the Thorns or not) was living there
          at the time. Good-looking, black hair, whiskers, and
          eyes, and given to deck himself out in diamond pins,
          studs, and rings. He has been called an aristocrat
          to me, but I think it equally likely that he was a
          member of the swell mob, doing the fine
          gentleman—which they always overdo. See if you can
          ferret out anything."</p>
  <p>"I will," said Mr. Dill. And he wished Mr. Carlyle good
          night.</p>
  <p>The servant came in to remove the glasses and the
          obnoxious pipes, which latter Miss Carlyle had
          ordered consigned to the open air the instant they
          were done with. Mr. Carlyle sat in a brown study:
          presently he looked round at the man.</p>
  <p>"Is Joyce gone to bed?"</p>
  <p>"No, sir. She's just going."</p>
  <pb n="84"/>
  <p>"Send her here when you have taken away those
          things."</p>
  <p>Joyce came in, the upper servant at Miss Carlyle's. She
          was of middle height, and would never see
          five-and-thirty again; her forehead was broad, her
          grey eyes were deeply set, and her face was pale.
          Altogether she was plain, but sensible-looking. She
          was the half-sister to the Afy Hallijohn.</p>
  <p>"Shut the door, Joyce."</p>
  <p>Joyce did as she was bid, came forward, and stood by the
          table.</p>
  <p>"Have you ever heard from your sister, Joyce?" began Mr.
          Carlyle, somewhat abruptly.</p>
  <p>"No, sir," was the reply. "I think it would be a wonder
          if I did hear."</p>
  <p>"Why so?"</p>
  <p>"If she could go off after Richard Hare, who had sent her
          father into his grave, she would be more likely to
          hide herself and her doings, than to proclaim them
          to me, sir."</p>
  <p>"Who was that other, that fine gentleman, who came after
          her?"</p>
  <p>The colour mantled in Joyce's cheeks, and she dropped her
          voice. "Sir! did you hear of him?"</p>
  <p>"Not at the time. Since. He came from Swainson, did he
          not?"</p>
  <p>"I believe so, sir. Afy never would say much about him.
          We did not agree upon the point: I said a person of
          his rank would do her no good; and Afy flew out when
          I spoke against him."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle caught her up. "His rank! what was his
          rank?"</p>
  <p>"Afy bragged of his being next door to a lord; and <pb n="85"/> he looked liked it. I only saw him once;
          I had gone home early, and there he sat with Afy.
          His white hands were all glittering with rings, and
          his shirt was finished off with shining stones,
          where the buttons ought to be."</p>
  <p>"Have you seen him since?"</p>
  <p>"Never since, never but that once, and I don't think I
          should know him if I did see him. He got up, sir, as
          soon as I went into the parlour, shook hands with
          Afy, and left. A fine upright man he was, nearly as
          tall as you, sir, but very thin; those soldiers
          always do carry themselves well."</p>
  <p>"How do you know he was a soldier?" quickly rejoined Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Afy told me so. 'The captain,' she had used to call him;
          but she said he was not a captain yet a while the
          next grade below it. A—a—"</p>
  <p>"Lieutenant?" suggested Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir, that was it; Lieutenant Thorn. As he was going
          through the kitchen that evening he dropped his
          handkerchief, such a beauty, it was. I picked it up,
          but Afy snatched it from me, and, running to the
          door, called after him, 'Captain Thorn, you have
          dropped your handkerchief,' and he turned and took
          it from her. And when he was fairly off, she began
          upon me for coming home and spoiling sport, and we
          had a quarrel. I had seen young Hare also the same
          evening in the wood, dodging about as if he waited
          for the other to go. 'She'll come to no good between
          the two,' was my thought, and I said it to her, and
          a fine passion it put her in. It was but a week
          afterwards that—the evil happened to poor
          father."</p>
  <p>"Joyce," said Mr. Carlyle, "has it never struck you <pb n="86"/> that Afy is more likely to have followed
          this Lientenant Thorn, than Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>"No, sir," answered Joyce; "I have felt certain always
          that she is with Richard Hare, and nothing can turn
          me from the belief. All West Lynne is convinced of
          it."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle did not attempt to "turn her from the
          belief." He dismissed her, and sat on still
          revolving the case in all its bearings.</p>
  <p>Richard Hare's short interview with his mother had soon
          terminated. It lasted but a quarter of an hour, both
          dreading interruption from the servants. And with
          the hundred pounds in his pocket and desolation at
          his heart, the ill-fated young man once more quitted
          his childhood's home. Mrs. Hare and Barbara watched
          him steal down the path in the tell-tale moonlight,
          and gain the road, both feeling that those farewell
          kisses, they had pressed upon his lips, would not be
          renewed for years, and might be never.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VII. MISS CARLYLE AT HOME.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> church clocks of West Lynne struck eight one
          lovely morning in July, and then the bells chimed
          out, giving token that it was Sunday. Simultaneously
          with the bells, Miss Carlyle burst out of her
          bed-room in one of her ordinary morning costumes,
          but not the one in which she was wont to be seen on
          a Sunday. She wore a buff gingham gown, reaching
          nearly to her ankles, and a lavender print
          "bedgown," which was tied round the waist with a
          cord and tassels, and ornamented off below it with a
          frill. It had been the morning costume of her mother
          in the old-fashioned days, and Miss Carlyle despised
          new fashions too much to discard it. Modern ladies
          might cavil at the style, but they could not at the
          quality and freshness of the materials, for in that
          Miss Carlyle was scrupulously particular. On Sunday
          mornings it was her custom to appear attired for the
          day, and her not doing so now proved that she must
          have some domestic work in prospect. Her head-dress
          cannot be described; it was like nothing in the mode
          book or out of it: some might have called it a
          turban, some a night-cap, and some might have
          thought it was taken from a model of the dunce's cap
          and bells in the parish school; at any rate, it was
          something <pb n="88"/> very high, and expansive, and
          white, and stern, and imposing.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle stepped across the corridor to a door
          opposite her own, and gave a thump at it,
          sufficiently loud to awaken the seven sleepers. "Get
          up, Archibald."</p>
  <p>"Up!" cried a drowsy voice within. "What for? It's only
          eight o'clock."</p>
  <p>"If it's only six, you must get up," repeated Miss
          Carlyle, in her authoritative manner. "The breakfast
          is waiting, and I must have it over, for we are all
          at sixes and sevens."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle descended the stairs, and entered the
          breakfast-room, where all appeared in readiness for
          the meal. She had a sharp tongue on occasion, and a
          sharp eye always, which saw everything. The room
          looked on to the street, and the windows were up,
          their handsome white curtains, spotless as Miss
          Carlyle's head-dress, waving gently in the summer
          breeze. Miss Carlyle's eyes peered round the room,
          and they caught sight of some dust. She strode into
          the kitchen to salute Joyce with the information.
          Joyce stood at the kitchen fire, superintending the
          toasting of some bacon.</p>
  <p>"How dare you be so negligent, Joyce? You have never
          dusted the breakfast-parlour."</p>
  <p>"Never dusted it!" returned Joyce, where could your eyes
          have been ma'am, to see that?"</p>
  <p>"On the dust," replied Miss Carlyle. "Go and put yours on
          it, and take the duster with you. I cannot sit down
          in an untidy room. Just because you have a little
          extra work to do this morning, you are turning
          lazy."</p>
  <p>"No, ma'am," retorted Joyce, with spirit, for she <pb n="89"/> felt the charge was perfectly unfounded,
          "I have exerted myself to the utmost this morning. I
          was up at five o'clock to get the double work
          comfortably over, that you might have no occasion to
          find fault, and I was as particular over the
          breakfast-parlour as I always am. You insist upon
          having the windows thrown up, and of course the dust
          will fly in."</p>
  <p>Joyce retreated with her duster just as a bell was heard
          to ring, and a most respectable-looking servingman
          of middle height, portly form, fair complexion, and
          a scant portion of hair that was turning grey,
          entered the kitchen.</p>
  <p>"Do you want anything, Peter?" inquired Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Master's shaving water, ma'am. He has rung for it."</p>
  <p>"Master can't have it, then," was the retort of Miss
          Carlyle. "Go and say so. Tell him that the
          breakfast's waiting, and he must shave
          afterwards."</p>
  <p>Peter retired with the message, most probably softening
          it in the delivery, and Miss Carlyle presently
          returned to the breakfast-parlour and seated herself
          at the table to wait for her brother.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle, the previous evening, had embroiled herself
          in a dispute with her cook. The latter, who was of a
          fiery temper, retorted insolently, and her mistress
          gave her warning, for insolence from a servant she
          never put up with, and rarely indeed was it offered
          her. The girl, in her heat of passion, said she did
          not want to wait for warning, she'd go at once; and
          off she went. Miss Carlyle pronounced the house well
          rid of her. Miss Carlyle was rigid upon one
          point—that of having as little work done upon a
          Sunday as possible, and when the Sunday's dinner was
          of a nature that could be put <pb n="90"/> forward
          upon the Saturday, it was required to be done: upon
          this rock, had Miss Carlyle and the cook split. To
          add to the inconvenience, the housemaid was from
          home, enjoying a holiday.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle came into the breakfast-room, completely
          dressed: he had an invincible dislike to appear like
          a sloven, and he had shaved in cold water. "Why are
          we breakfasting at eight this morning?" he
          inquired.</p>
  <p>"Because I have so much to do. And if I cannot get
          breakfast over early I shall never finish it in time
          for church," was the reply of Miss Carlyle. "The
          cook's gone."</p>
  <p>"The cook gone!" repeated Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It all happened after you went out to spend the evening,
          and I did not sit up to tell you. We are to have
          ducks for dinner to-day, and she knew they were to
          be stuffed and prepared yesterday, the gravy made,
          and the giblet-pie made and baked; in short,
          everything done, except just the roasting. I asked
          her last night if it was done. 'Oh yes, it was all
          done;' she said, and I told her to bring me the
          giblet-pie to look at, knowing she has a knack of
          burning the crust of her pies. Well, she could not;
          she had told me a falsehood, Archibald, and had got
          no pie to bring, for the ducks were untouched, just
          as they came into the house; she had idly put it all
          off till to-day, thinking I should never find her
          out, but my asking for the pie floored her. She was
          insolent, and what with that and the lie, I gave her
          warning, but she chose to leave last night. I have
          got it all to do myself this morning."</p>
  <p>"Can't Joyce do it?" returned Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Joyce! Much she knows about cooking; Joyce's <pb n="91"/> cooking won't do for my table. Barbara Hare is
          going to spend the day here."</p>
  <p>"Indeed."</p>
  <p>"Barbara called last evening, full of trouble. She and
          the justice had been having a dispute, and she said
          she wished I would invite her for to-day. Barbara
          has been laying in a stock of finery; the justice
          caught sight of it as it came home, and Barbara
          suffered. Serve her right, vain little minx. Just
          hark at the bells, clattering out!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle lifted his head. The bells of St. Jude's
          church were ringing out a merry peal, as for a
          wedding, or for any other festivity. "What can that
          be for?" he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, you are not half as sharp as I was at your
          age. What should they be ringing for, but out of
          compliment to the arrival of Lord Mount Severn?"</p>
  <p>"Ay; no doubt. The East Lynne pew is in St. Jude's
          church."</p>
  <p>East Lynne had changed owners, and was now the property
          of Mr. Carlyle. He had bought it as it stood,
          furniture and all; but the transfer had been
          conducted with secrecy, and was suspected by none.
          Whether Lord Mount Severn thought it might prevent
          any one getting on the scent, or whether he wished
          to take farewell of a place he had formerly been
          fond of, certain it is, that he desired to visit it
          for a week or two. Mr. Carlyle most readily and
          graciously acquiesced; and the earl, his daughter,
          and retinue had arrived the previous day.</p>
  <p>West Lynne was in ecstasies. It called itself an
          aristocratic place, and it indulged hopes that the
          earl might be intending to confer upon it
          permanently the <pb n="92"/> light of his presence,
          by taking up his residence again at East Lynne. The
          toilettes prepared to greet his admiring eyes were
          prodigious, and pretty Barbara Hare was not the only
          young lady who had thereby to encounter the paternal
          storm.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle completed her dinner preparations, all she
          did not choose to trust to Joyce, and was ready for
          church at the usual time, plainly but well-dressed.
          As she and Archibald were leaving their house, they
          saw something looming up the street, flashing and
          gleaming in the sun. A pink parasol came first, a
          pink bonnet and feather came behind it, a grey
          brocaded dress, and white gloves.</p>
  <p>"The little vain idiot!" ejaculated Miss Carlyle. But
          Barbara sailed up the street towards them,
          unconscious of the apostrophe.</p>
  <p>"Well done, Barbara!" was the salutation of Miss Carlyle.
          "The justice might well call out! you are finer than
          a sunbeam."</p>
  <p>"Not half so fine as many another in the church will be
          to-day," responded Barbara, as she lifted her shy
          blue eyes and blushing face to answer the greeting
          of Mr. Carlyle. "West Lynne seems bent on
          outdressing the Lady Isabel. You should have been in
          at the milliner's yesterday morning, Miss
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Is all the finery coming out to-day?" gravely inquired
          Mr. Carlyle, as Barbara turned with them towards the
          church and he walked by her side and his sister's,
          for he had an objection, almost as invincible as a
          Frenchman's, to give his arm to two ladies.</p>
  <p>"Of course," replied Barbara. "The earl and his daughter
          will be coming to church."</p>
  <pb n="93"/>
  <p>"Suppose she should not be in peacock's plumes," cried
          Miss Carlyle, with an imperturbable face.</p>
  <p>"Oh, but she's sure to be—if you mean richly dressed,"
          cried Barbara, hastily.</p>
  <p>"Or, suppose they should not come to church?" laughed Mr.
          Carlyle. "What a disappointment to the bonnets and
          feathers!"</p>
  <p>"After all, Barbara, what are they to us, or we to them?"
          resumed Miss Carlyle. "We may never meet. We
          insignificant West Lynne gentry shall not intrude
          ourselves into East Lynne. It would scarcely be
          fitting: or be deemed so by the earl and Lady
          Isabel."</p>
  <p>"That's just what papa said," grumbled Barbara. "He
          caught sight of this bonnet yesterday, and when, by
          way of excuse, I said I had it to call on them, he
          asked whether I thought the obscure West Lynne
          families would venture to thrust their calls on Lord
          Mount Severn, as though they were of the county
          aristocracy. It was the feather put him out."</p>
  <p>"It is a very long one," remarked Miss Carlyle, grimly
          surveying it.</p>
  <p>Barbara was to sit in the Carlyle pew that day, for she
          thought the farther she was off the justice, the
          better: there was no knowing but he might take a sly
          revengeful cut at the feather in the middle of
          service, and so dock its beauty. Scarcely were they
          seated, when some strangers came quietly up the
          aisle; a gentleman who limped as he walked, with a
          furrowed brow, and grey hair; and a young lady.
          Barbara looked round with eagerness, but looked away
          again: they could not be the expected strangers, the
          young lady's dress was too plain. A clear muslin
          dress with small lilac sprigs upon it, and a straw
          bonnet: Miss <pb n="94"/> Corny might have worn it
          herself on a week day, and not have found herself
          too smart; but it was a pleasant dress for a hot
          summer's day. But the old beadle, in his many-caped
          coat, was walking before them sideways with his
          marshalling bâton, and he marshalled them into the
          East Lynne pew, unoccupied for so many years.</p>
  <p>"Who in the world can they be?" whispered Barbara to Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"The earl and Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>The colour flushed into Barbara's face, and she stared at
          Miss Corny. "Why—she has no silks, and no feathers,
          and no anything!" cried Barbara. "She's plainer than
          anybody in the church!"</p>
  <p>"Plainer than any of the fine ones—than you, for
          instance. The earl is much altered, but I should
          have known them both anywhere. I should have known
          her from her likeness to her poor mother; just the
          same eyes, and sweet expression."</p>
  <p>Ay, those brown eyes, so full of sweetness and
          melancholy: few, who had once seen, could mistake or
          forget them, and Barbara Hare, forgetting where she
          was, looked at them much that day. "She is very
          lovely," thought Barbara, "and her dress is
          certainly that of a lady. I wish I had not had this
          streaming pink feather. What fine jackdaws she must
          deem us all!"</p>
  <p>The earl's carriage, an open barouche, was waiting at the
          gate at the conclusion of the service. He handed his
          daughter in, and was putting his gouty foot upon the
          step to follow her, when he observed Mr. Carlyle.
          The earl turned and held out his hand. A man who
          could purchase East Lynne was worthy of being
          received as an equal, though he was but a country
          lawyer.</p>
  <pb n="95"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle shook hands with the earl, approached the
          carriage, and raised his hat to Lady Isabel. She
          bent forward with her pleasant smile, and put her
          hand into his.</p>
  <p>"I have many things to say to you," said the earl. "I
          wish you would go home with us. If you have nothing
          better to do, be East Lynne's guest for the
          remainder of the day."</p>
  <p>He smiled peculiarly as he spoke, and Mr. Carlyle echoed
          it. East Lynne's guest! that is what the earl was,
          at present. Mr. Carlyle turned aside to tell his
          sister.</p>
  <p>"Cornelia, I shall not be home to dinner, I am going with
          Lord Mount Severn. Good day, Barbara."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stepped into the carriage, was followed by
          the earl, and it drove away. The sun shone still,
          but the day's brightness had gone out for Barbara
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"How does he know the earl so well? how does he know Lady
          Isabel?" she reiterated in her astonishment.</p>
  <p>"Archibald knows something of most people," replied Miss
          Corny. "He saw the earl frequently when he was in
          town in the spring, and Lady Isabel once or twice.
          What a lovely face she has."</p>
  <p>Barbara made no reply. She returned with Miss Carlyle to
          the attractions of the ducks and the gibletpie, but
          her manner was as absent as her heart, and that had
          run away to East Lynne.</p>
  <p>Oh, the refinement of courtly life, the unnecessary
          profusion of splendour! thought Mr. Carlyle, as he
          sat down to the earl's dinner-table that day. The
          display of shining silver, of glittering glass, of
          costly china; <pb n="96"/> the various wines and the
          rich viands, too varied and rich for the earl's
          gout; the many servants in their handsome livery;
          the table's pleasant master, and its refined young
          mistress! In spite of the earl's terrible
          embarrassments, he had never yet curtailed the pomp
          of home expenditure: how he had maintained it, was a
          marvel; how long he would succeed in maintaining it,
          was another. Very unnecessary and unjustifiable was
          the splendour, under the circumstances, but it had
          its attractions. Exceeding great were the
          attractions that day, all things combined. Take care
          of your senses, Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Isabel left them after dinner, and sat alone, her
          thoughts running on many things. On her dear mother,
          with whom she was last at East Lynne, on the
          troublesome gout that would not quite leave her
          father, and on the scenes she had lately mixed in in
          London. She had met one there so constantly that he
          had almost become dangerous to her peace, or would
          have done so, had she remained much longer; even
          now, as she thought of him, a thrill quickened her
          veins; it was Francis Levison. Mrs. Vane had been
          guilty of worse than thoughtlessness, to throw them
          so frequently together. Mrs. Vane was a cold,
          selfish, and a bad woman; bad, inasmuch as, save her
          own heartless self, she cared for no human being on
          the face of the wide earth.</p>
  <p>With a sigh, Isabel rose, and scattered her reflections
          to the winds. Her father and his guest did not
          appear to be in a haste to come in to tea, and she
          sat down to the piano.</p>
  <p>The earl was certainly not in a haste; he never was in a
          haste to quit his wine; every glass was little less
            <pb n="97"/> than poison to him in his state of
          health, but he would not forego it. They were deep
          in conversation, when Mr. Carlyle, who was speaking,
          broke off in the middle of a sentence and
          listened.</p>
  <p>A strain of the sweetest music had arisen; it seemed
          almost close to his ear, but he knew not whence it
          came; a voice, low and clear and sweet, was
          accompanying it, and Mr. Carlyle held his breath. It
          was the Benedictus, sung to Mornington's chant.</p>
  <p>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: for he hath visited
          and redeemed his people. And hath raised up a mighty
          salvation for us: in the house of his servant
          David."</p>
  <p>The conversation of the earl and Mr. Carlyle had been of
          the eager bustling world, of money getting and money
          spending, money owing and money paying, and that
          sacred chant broke in upon them with strange
          contrast, soothing to the ear, but reproving to the
          heart.</p>
  <p>"It is Isabel," explained the earl. "Her singing carries
          a singular charm with it; and I think that charm
          lies in her subdued, quiet style: I hate squalling
          display. Her playing is the same. Are you fond of
          music?"</p>
  <p>"I have been reproached by scientific performers with
          having neither ear nor taste for what they style
          good music," smiled Mr. Carlyle; "but I like
            <hi>that</hi> ."</p>
  <p>"The instrument is placed against the wall, and the
          partition is thin," remarked the earl. "Isabel
          little thinks she is entertaining us, as well as
          herself."</p>
  <p>Indeed she did not. She sang chant after chant, now one
          psalm to them, now another. Then she sang the
          collect for the seventh Sunday after Trinity, and
          then she went back again to the chants. And Mr.
          Carlyle sat on, drinking in that delightful music,
          and never heeding how the evening was running on
          into night.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VIII. MR. KANE'S CONCERT.</head>
  <p><hi>Before</hi> Lord Mount Severn had completed the
          fortnight of his proposed stay, the gout came back
          seriously. It was impossible for him to move away
          from East Lynne. Mr. Carlyle assured him he was only
          too pleased that he should remain as long as might
          be convenient, and the earl expressed his
          acknowledgments; he hoped soon to be re-established
          on his legs.</p>
  <p>But he was not. The gout came and the gout went; not
          positively laying him up in bed, but rendering him
          unable to leave his rooms: and this continued till
          October, when he grew much better. The county
          families had been neighbourly, calling on the
          invalid earl, and occasionally carrying off Lady
          Isabel, but his chief and constant visitor had been
          Mr. Carlyle. The earl had grown to like him in no
          common degree, and was disappointed if Mr. Carlyle
          spent an evening away from him, so that he had
          become, as it were, quite domesticated with the earl
          and Isabel. "I am not equal to general society," he
          observed to his daughter, "and it is considerate and
          kind of Carlyle to come here and cheer my
          loneliness."</p>
  <p>"Extremely kind," said Isabel. "I like him very much,
          papa."</p>
  <pb n="99"/>
  <p>"I don't know anybody whom I like half as well," was the
          rejoinder of the earl.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle went up as usual that same evening, and in
          the course of it the earl asked Isabel to sing.</p>
  <p>"I will if you wish, papa," was the reply, "but the piano
          is so much out of tune that it is not pleasant to
          sing to it. Is there nobody in West Lynne who could
          come here and tune my piano, Mr. Carlyle?" she
          added, turning to him.</p>
  <p>"Certainly there is. Kane would do it. Shall I send him
          to-morrow?"</p>
  <p>"I should be glad; if it would not be giving you too much
          trouble. Not that tuning will benefit it greatly,
          old thing that it is. Were we to be much at East
          Lynne, I should get papa to exchange it for a good
          one."</p>
  <p>Little thought Lady Isabel that very piano was Mr.
          Carlyle's, and not hers. The earl coughed, and
          exchanged a smile and a glance with his guest.</p>
  <p>Mr. Kane was the organist of St. Jude's church, a man of
          embarrassment and sorrow, who had long had a sore
          fight with the world. When he arrived at East Lynne
          the following day, Lady Isabel happened to be
          playing, and she stood by and watched him begin his
          work. She was courteous and affable; she was so to
          every one; and the poor music-master took courage to
          speak of his own affairs, and to prefer an humble
          request —that she and Lord Mount Severn would
          patronise and personally attend a concert he was
          about to give the following week. A scarlet blush
          came into his thin cheeks as he confessed that he
          was very poor, could scarcely live, and that he was
          getting up this concert in his desperate need. If it
          succeeded—well: he could <pb n="100"/> then go on
          again: if not, he should be turned out of his home,
          and his furniture sold for the two years' rent he
          owed—and he had seven children.</p>
  <p>Isabel, all her sympathies awakened, sought the earl.
          "Oh, papa! I have to ask you the greatest favour!
          Will you grant it?"</p>
  <p>"Ay, child, you don't ask them often. What is it?"</p>
  <p>"I want you to take me to a concert at West Lynne."</p>
  <p>The earl fell back in surprise and stared at Isabel. "A
          concert at West Lynne!" he laughed. "To hear rustics
          scraping the fiddle! My dear Isabel!"</p>
  <p>She poured out what she had just heard, with her own
          comments and additions. "Seven children, papa! and
          if the concert does not succeed he must give up his
          home, and turn out into the streets with them—it is,
          you see, almost as a matter of life or death to him.
          He is very poor."</p>
  <p>"I am poor myself," said the earl.</p>
  <p>"I was so sorry for him when he was speaking. He kept
          turning red and white, and catching up his breath in
          agitation: it was painful to him to tell of his
          embarrassments. I am sure he is a gentleman."</p>
  <p>"Well, you may take a pound's worth of tickets, Isabel,
          and give them to the upper servants. A village
          concert!"</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa, it is not that; can't you see it is not? If
          you and I promise to be present, all the families
          round West Lynne will attend, and he will have the
          room full. They will go because we do; he said so:
          if they thought it was our servants who were going,
          they would keep away. Just think, papa, how you
          would <pb n="101"/> like for this furniture to be
          taken away from you! and his having a full concert
          would stop it. Make a sacrifice for once, dearest
          papa, and go, if it be only for an hour: <hi>I</hi>
          shall enjoy it, if there's nothing but a fiddle and
          a tambourine."</p>
  <p>"You gipsy! you are as bad as a professional beggar.
          There; go and tell the fellow we will look in for
          half an hour."</p>
  <p>She flew back to Mr. Kane, her eyes dancing. She spoke
          quietly, as she always did, but her own satisfaction
          gladdened her voice.</p>
  <p>"I am happy to tell you that papa has consented. He will
          take four tickets, and we will attend the
          concert."</p>
  <p>The tears rushed into Mr. Kane's eyes: Isabel was not
          sure but they were in her own. He was a tall, thin,
          delicate-looking man, with long white fingers, and a
          long neck. He faltered forth his thanks, and an
          inquiry whether he might be allowed to state openly
          that they would be present.</p>
  <p>"Tell everybody," said she eagerly—"everybody you meet,
          if you think it will be the means of inducing people
          to attend. I shall tell all friends who call upon
          me, and ask them to go."</p>
  <p>When Mr. Carlyle came up in the evening, the earl was
          temporarily absent from the room. Isabel began to
          speak of the concert.</p>
  <p>"It is a hazardous venture for Kane," observed Mr.
          Carlyle. "I fear he will only lose money, and add to
          his embarrassments."</p>
  <p>"Why do you fear that?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Because, Lady Isabel, nothing gets patronised at West
          Lynne; nothing native; and people have heard <pb n="102"/> so long of poor Kane's necessities, that
          they think little of them. If some foreign artist,
          with an unpronounceable name, came flashing down to
          give a concert, West Lynne would flock to it."</p>
  <p>"Is he so very, very poor?"</p>
  <p>"Very. He is half-starved."</p>
  <p>"Starved!" repeated Isabel, an expression of perplexity
          arising to her face as she looked at Mr. Carlyle,
          for she scarcely understood him. "Do you mean that
          he does not have enough to eat?"</p>
  <p>"Of bread he may, but not of much better nourishment. His
          salary, as organist, is thirty pounds, and he gets a
          little stray teaching. But he has his wife and
          children to keep, and no doubt serves them before
          himself. I dare say he scarcely knows what it is to
          taste meat."</p>
  <p>The words brought a bitter pang to Lady Isabel. Not
          enough to eat! Never to taste meat! And she, in her
          carelessness, her ignorance, her indifference—she
          scarcely knew what term to give it—had not thought
          to order him a meal in their house of plenty! He had
          walked from West Lynne, occupied himself an hour
          with her piano, and set off to walk back again,
          battling with his hunger. A word from her, and a
          repast had been set before him out of their
          superfluities, such as he never now sat down to: and
          that word she had not spoken.</p>
  <p>"You are looking grave, Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"I am taking contrition to myself. Never mind; it cannot
          now be helped; but it will always be a dark spot on
          my memory."</p>
  <p>"What is it?"</p>
  <p>She lifted her repentant face to his, and smiled. <pb n="103"/> Never mind, I say, Mr. Carlyle; what is
          past cannot be recalled. He looks like a
          gentleman."</p>
  <p>"Who? Kane? A gentleman bred: his father was a clergyman.
          Kane's ruin was his love of music; it prevented his
          settling to any better-paid profession; his early
          marriage also was a drawback, and kept him down. He
          is young still."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle, I would not be one of your West Lynne
          people for the world. Here is a poor gentleman
          struggling with adversity, and you won't put your
          hands out to help him!"</p>
  <p>He smiled at her warmth. "Some of us will take tickets, I
          for one, but I don't know about attending the
          concert. I fear few will do that."</p>
  <p>"Because that's just the thing that would serve him! if
          one went, another would. Well, I shall try and show
          West Lynne that I don't take a lesson from their
          book; I shall be there before it begins, and never
          come out till the last song is over. I am not too
          grand to go, if West Lynne is."</p>
  <p>"You surely do not think of going!"</p>
  <p>"I surely do think of it. And papa goes with me; I
          persuaded him. And I have given Mr. Kane the
          promise."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle paused. "I am glad to hear it; it will be a
          perfect boon to Kane. If it once gets abroad that
          Lord Mount Severn and Lady Isabel intend to honour
          the concert, there won't be standing room."</p>
  <p>She danced round with a little gleeful step. "What high
          and mighty personages Lord Mount Severn and Lady
          Isabel seem to be! If you had any goodness of heart,
          Mr. Carlyle, you would enlist yourself in the cause
          also."</p>
  <pb n="104"/>
  <p>"I think I will," he smiled.</p>
  <p>"Papa says you hold sway at West Lynne. If you proclaim
          that you mean to go, you will induce others."</p>
  <p>"I will proclaim that you do," he answered. "That will be
          sufficient. But, Lady Isabel, you must not expect
          much gratification from the performances."</p>
  <p>"A tambourine will be quite enough for me; I told papa
          so. I shan't think of the music, I shall think of
          poor Mr. Kane. Mr. Carlyle, I know you can be kind
          if you like; I know you would rather be kind than
          otherwise, it is to be read in your face; try and do
          what you can for him."</p>
  <p>"Yes, I will, he warmly answered.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle sold many tickets the following day; or,
          rather, caused them to be sold. He praised the
          concert far and wide, and proclaimed that Lord Mount
          Severn and his daughter would not think of missing
          it. Mr. Kane's house was besieged for tickets,
          faster than he could write his signature in their
          corner, and when Mr. Carlyle went home to luncheon
          at mid-day, which he did not often do, he laid down
          two at Miss Corny's elbow.</p>
  <p>"What's this? Concert tickets! Archibald, you have never
          gone and bought these!"</p>
  <p>What would she have said had she known that the two were
          not the extent of his investment!</p>
  <p>"Ten shillings to throw away upon two paltry bits of
          cardboard!" chafed Miss Carlyle. "You always were a
          noodle in money matters, Archibald, and always will
          be. I wish I had the keeping of your purse!"</p>
  <p>"What I have given will not hurt me, Cornelia. And Kane
          is badly off. Think of his troop of children."</p>
  <pb n="105"/>
  <p>"Oh dear," said Miss Corny, "I imagine he should think of
          them; I suppose it was his own fault they came.
          That's always it: poor folks get a heap of children
          about them, and then ask for pity. I should say it
          would be more just if they asked for blame."</p>
  <p>"Well, there the tickets are, bought and paid for, so
          they may as well be used. You will go with me
          Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"And stick ourselves there upon empty benches, like two
          geese, and sit staring and counting the candles! A
          pleasant evening!"</p>
  <p>"You need not fear empty benches. The Mount Severns are
          going, and West Lynne is in a fever, racing after
          tickets. I suppose you have got a—a— cap," looking
          at the nondescript article decorating his sister's
          head, "that will be suitable to go in, Cornelia: if
          not, you had better order one."</p>
  <p>This suggestion put up Miss Carlyle. "Hadn't you better
          have your hair curled, and your coat-tails lined
          with white satin, and buy a gold opera-glass, and a
          cocked-hat?" retorted she. "My gracious me! a fine
          new cap to go to their mess of a concert in, after
          paying ten shillings for the tickets! The world's
          coming to something."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle left her and her grumbling to return to the
          office. Lord Mount Severn's carriage was passing at
          the moment, and Isabel Vane was within it. She
          caused it to stop when she saw Mr. Carlyle, and he
          advanced to her.</p>
  <p>"I have been to Mr. Kane's myself for the tickets," said
          she, with a beaming look; "I came into West Lynne on
          purpose. I told the coachman to find out <pb n="106"/> where he lived, and he did. I thought if the
          people saw me and the carriage there, they would
          guess what I wanted. I do hope he will have a full
          concert."</p>
  <p>"I am sure he will," replied Mr. Carlyle, as he released
          her hand. And Lady Isabel signed to the carriage to
          drive on.</p>
  <p>As Mr. Carlyle turned away, he met Otway Bethel, a nephew
          of Colonel Bethel's, who was tolerated in the
          colonel's house because he had no other home, and
          appeared incapable of making himself one. Some
          persons persisted in calling him a gentleman—as he
          was by birth—others called him a <hi>mauvais
            sujet</hi> . The two are united some times. He was
          dressed in a velveteen suit, and had a gun in his
          hand; indeed, he was rarely seen without a gun,
          being inordinately fond of sport; but, if all tales
          whispered were true, he supplied himself with game
          in other ways than by shooting, which had the credit
          of going up to London dealers. For the last six
          months, or near upon it, he had been away from West
          Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Why, where have you been hiding yourself?" exclaimed Mr.
          Carlyle. "The colonel has been inconsolable."</p>
  <p>"Come, no gammon, Carlyle. I have been on the tramp
          through France and Germany. Man likes a change
          sometimes. As to the revered colonel, he would not
          be inconsolable if he saw me nailed up in a six-foot
          box, and carried out feet foremost."</p>
  <p>"Bethel, I have a question to ask you," continued Mr.
          Carlyle, dropping his light manner and his voice
          together. "Take you thoughts back to the night of
          Hallijohn's murder."</p>
  <pb n="107"/>
  <p>"I wish you may get it," cried Mr. Bethel. "The
          reminiscence is not attractive."</p>
  <p>"You'll do it," quietly said Mr. Carlyle. "It has been
          told to me, though it did not appear at the inquest,
          that Richard Hare held a conversation with you in
          the wood, a few minutes after the deed was done.
          Now—"</p>
  <p>"Who told you that?" interrupted Bethel.</p>
  <p>"That is not the question. My authority is
          indisputable."</p>
  <p>"It is true that he did. I said nothing about it, for I
          did not want to make the case worse against Dick
          Hare than it, already was. He certainly did accost
          me, like a man flurried out of his life."</p>
  <p>"Asking if you had seen a certain lover of Afy's fly from
          the cottage. One Thorn."</p>
  <p>"That was the purport. Thorn? Thorn?—I think Thorn was
          the name he mentioned. My opinion was, that Dick was
          either wild, or acting a part."</p>
  <p>"Now, Bethel, I want you to answer me truly. The question
          cannot affect you either way, but I must know
          whether you did see this Thorn leave the
          cottage."</p>
  <p>Bethel shook his head. "I know nothing whatever about any
          Thorn, and I saw nobody but Dick Hare. Not but what
          a dozen Thorns might have run from the cottage
          without my seeing them."</p>
  <p>"You heard this shot fired?"</p>
  <p>"Yes; but I never gave a thought to mischief. I knew
          Locksley was in the wood, and supposed it came from
          him. I ran across the path, bearing towards the
          cottage, and struck into the wood on the other side.
            <pb n="108"/> By-and-bye, Dick Hare pitched upon
          me; like one startled out of his senses, and asked
          if I had seen Thorn leave the cottage. Thorn—that
            <hi>was</hi> the name."</p>
  <p>"And you had not?"</p>
  <p>"I had seen nobody but Dick, excepting Locksley. My
          impression was, that nobody was about; I think so
          still."</p>
  <p>"But Richard—"</p>
  <p>"Now look you here, Carlyle, I won't do Dick Hare an
          injury, even by a single word, if I can help it. And
          it is of no use setting me on to it."</p>
  <p>"I should be the last to set you on to injure any one,
          especially Richard Hare," rejoined Mr. Carlyle, "and
          my motive is to do Richard good, not harm. I hold a
          suspicion, no matter whence gathered, that it was
          not Richard Hare who committed the murder, but
          another. Can you throw any light upon the
          subject?"</p>
  <p>"No, I can't. I have always thought poor wavering Dick
          was nobody's enemy but his own: but, as to throwing
          any light upon that night's work, I can't do it.
          Cords should not have dragged me to the inquest to
          give evidence against Dick, and for that reason I
          was glad Locksley never let out that I was on the
          spot. How the deuce it got about afterwards that I
          was, I can't tell; but that was no matter;
            <hi>my</hi> evidence did not help on the verdict.
          And, talking of that, Carlyle, how has it come to
          your knowledge that Richard Hare accosted me? I have
          not opened my lips upon it to mortal man."</p>
  <p>"It is of no consequence how," repeated Mr. Carlyle; "I
          do know it, and that is sufficient. I was in <pb n="109"/> hopes you had really seen this Thorn
          leave the cottage."</p>
  <p>Otway Bethel shook his head. "I should not lay too much
          stress upon any 'Thorn's' having been there, were I
          you, Carlyle. Dick Hare was as one crazy that night,
          and might see shapes and forms where there were
          none."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER IX. THE BATS AT THE WINDOW.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> concert was to take place on a Thursday, and
          on the following Saturday Lord Mount Severn intended
          finally to quit East Lynne. The necessary
          preparations for departure were in progress, but
          when Thursday morning dawned, it appeared a question
          whether they would not once more be rendered
          nugatory. The house was roused betimes, and Mr.
          Wainwright, the surgeon from West Lynne, summoned to
          the earl's bedside: he had experienced another and a
          violent attack. The peer was exceedingly annoyed and
          vexed, and very irritable.</p>
  <p>"I may be kept here a week—a fortnight—a month longer,
          now!" he uttered fretfully to Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I am very sorry, papa. I dare say you do find East Lynne
          dull."</p>
  <p>"Dull! that's not it: I have other reasons for wishing
          East Lynne to be quit of us. And now you can't go to
          this fine concert."</p>
  <p>Isabel's face flushed. "Not go, papa?"</p>
  <p>"Why, who is take you? I can't get out of bed."</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa, I must be there. Otherwise it would look
          almost as though—as though we had announced what we
          did not mean to perform. You know it was arranged
          that we should join the Ducies: the carriage <pb n="111"/> can still take me to the concert-room,
          and I can go in with them."</p>
  <p>"Just as you please. I thought you would have jumped at
          any plea for staying away."</p>
  <p>"Not at all," laughed Isabel. "I should like West Lynne
          to see that I don't despise Mr. Kane and his
          concert."</p>
  <p>Later in the day, the earl grew alarmingly worse: his
          paroxysms of pain were awful. Isabel, who was kept
          from the room, knew nothing of the danger, and the
          earl's groans did not penetrate to her ears. She
          dressed herself in a gleeful mood, full of laughing
          wilfulness, Marvel, her maid, superintending in
          stiff displeasure, for the attire chosen did not
          meet her approbation. When ready, she went into the
          earl's room.</p>
  <p>"Shall I do, papa?"</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn raised his swollen eyelids and drew the
          clothes from his flushed face. A shining vision was
          standing before him, a beauteous queen, a gleaming
          fairy; he hardly knew what she looked like. She had
          put on a white lace dress and her diamonds; the
          dress was rich, and the jewels gleamed from her
          hair, from her pretty neck, from her delicate arms;
          and her cheeks were flushed and her curls were
          flowing.</p>
  <p>The earl stared at her in amazement. "How could you dress
          yourself like that for a concert? You are out of
          your senses, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Marvel thinks so too," was the gay answer; "she has had
          a cross face since I told her what to put out. But I
          did it on purpose, papa; I thought I would show <pb n="112"/> those West Lynne people that <hi>I</hi>
          think the poor man's concert worth going to, and
          worth dressing for."</p>
  <p>"You will have the whole room gaping at you."</p>
  <p>"I don't mind. I'll bring you word all about it. Let them
          gape."</p>
  <p>"You vain child! You have dressed yourself to please your
          vanity. "But, Isabel, you—ooooooh!"</p>
  <p>Isabel started as she stood: the earl's groan of pain was
          dreadful.</p>
  <p>"An awful twinge, child. There, go along: talking makes
          me worse."</p>
  <p>"Papa, shall I stay at home with you?" she gravely asked.
          "Every consideration should give way to illness. If
          you would like me to remain, or if I can do any
          good, pray let me."</p>
  <p>"Quite the contrary; I had rather you were away. You can
          do no earthly good, for I could not have you in the
          room. Good bye, darling. If you see Carlyle, tell
          him I shall hope to see him to-morrow."</p>
  <p>Marvel threw a mantle over her shoulders, and she went
          down to the carriage, which waited.</p>
  <p>The concert was held in the noted justice-room, over the
          market-place, called by courtesy the town-hall. It
          was large, commodious, and good for sound; many a
          town of far greater importance cannot boast so good
          a music-room. In the way of performers, Mr. Kane had
          done his poor best; a lady, quite fourth rate, was
          engaged from London, and the rest were local
          artistes.</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare would not have missed the concert for the
          world, but Mrs. Hare had neither health nor spirits
          for it. It was arranged that the justice and Barbara
          should accompany the Carlyles, and they proceeded to
          Miss Carlyle's in time for coffee. Something <pb n="113"/> was said about a fly, but Miss Carlyle
          negatived it, asking what had come to their legs: it
          was a fine night, and the distance very short.
          Barbara had no objection to the walk with Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"How is it that we see so little of you now?" she began,
          as they went along, Mr. Justice Hare and Miss
          Carlyle preceding them.</p>
  <p>"I have been so much engaged at East Lynne: the earl
          finds his evenings dull. They go on Saturday, and my
          time will be my own again."</p>
  <p>"You were expected at the parsonage last night; we were
          looking for you all the evening."</p>
  <p>"Not expected by Mr. and Mrs. Little, I think. I told
          them I was engaged to dine at East Lynne."</p>
  <p>"They were saying—some of them—that you might as well
          take up your abode at East Lynne, and wondered what
          your attraction could be. They said"—Barbara
          compelled her voice to calmness—"that if Isabel Vane
          were not the Lady Isabel, they should think you went
          there courting."</p>
  <p>"I am much obliged at their interesting themselves so
          much about me," equably returned Mr. Carlyle. "More
          so than Lady Isabel Vane would probably be. I am
          surprised that you should retail such nonsense,
          Barbara."</p>
  <p>"They said it; I did not," answered Barbara, with a
          swelling heart. "Is it true that Lady Isabel sings
          so well? They were making out that her singing is
          divine."</p>
  <p>"You had better not let Cornelia hear you say that, or
          you will get a reproof," laughed Mr. Carlyle. "Like
          I did, when I said she had an angel's face."</p>
  <p>Barbara turned her own face full upon him: it <pb n="114"/> looked pale in the gaslight. "Did you say she had
          an angel's face? Do you think it one?"</p>
  <p>"I really believe I did say so, but I can't be quite
          sure, Cornelia snapped me up so quickly," he
          answered, laughing. "Barbara," he added, dropping
          his voice, "we have still not heard from
          Richard."</p>
  <p>"No. You and mamma both think we shall hear; I say not,
          for I feel sure he will be afraid to write. I know
          he promised, but I have never thought he would
          perform."</p>
  <p>"There would be no risk, sending the letters under cover
          to me, and it would be a relief and a comfort to
          Mrs. Hare."</p>
  <p>"You know how timorous Richard is. Otway Bethel is home
          again," she continued. "You said you should question
          him when he returned, Archibald."</p>
  <p>"I have done so, but he appears to know nothing. He seems
          well disposed to Richard, but casts doubt on the
          assertion that Thorn, or any stranger, was in the
          wood that night."</p>
  <p>"It is very strange what Thorn it could have been."</p>
  <p>"Very," assented Mr. Carlyle. "I can make out nothing
          from Swainson. No person whatever, answering the
          description and named Thorn, was living there at the
          time, so far as I am able to ascertain. All we can
          do is to wait, and hope that time may bring
          elucidation with it."</p>
  <p>They reached the town-hall as he spoke. A busy crowd was
          gathered round the entrance; people going in to
          attend the concert, and the mob watching them. Drawn
          up at a short distance, so as not to obstruct other
          vehicles, was the aristocratic carriage of Lord
          Mount <pb n="115"/> Severn: the coachman sat on his
          hammercloth, and two powdered footmen waited with
          it.</p>
  <p>"Lady Isabel Vane is sitting there," exclaimed Barbara as
          she passed.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt surprised. What could she be waiting
          there for? where could the earl be? A doubt came
          over him, he could not define why, that something
          was wrong.</p>
  <p>"Will you pardon me if I quit you for one moment,
          Barbara, whilst I speak to Lady Isabel?"</p>
  <p>He waited for neither acquiescence nor dissent, but left
          Barbara standing where she was, and accosted Isabel.
          The diamonds gleamed in her shining curls, as she
          bent towards him.</p>
  <p>"I am waiting for Mrs. Ducie, Mr. Carlyle. I did not like
          to remain all alone in the ante-room, so I stayed
          here. When Mrs. Ducie's carriage comes up, I shall
          get out. I am going in with her, you know."</p>
  <p>"And the earl?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, have you not heard? Papa is ill again."</p>
  <p>"Ill again!" repeated Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Very ill indeed. Mr. Wainwright was sent for at five
          o'clock this morning, and has been with him a good
          deal of the day. Papa bade me say that he hoped to
          see you to-morrow."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle rejoined Barbara: they entered the hall and
          began to ascend the stairs, just as another
          aristocratic equipage dashed up, to scatter and
          gratify the mob. Barbara turned her head to look: it
          was that of the Honourable Mrs. Ducie.</p>
  <p>The room was pretty full then, and Mrs. Ducie, her two
          daughters, and Isabel were conducted to seats by Mr.
          Kane—seats he had reserved for them at the upper <pb n="116"/> end, near the orchestra. The same
          dazzling vision which had burst on the sight of Lord
          Mount Severn, fell on that of the audience, in
          Isabel, with her rich white dress, her glittering
          diamonds, her flowing curls, and her wondrous
          beauty. The Miss Ducies, plain girls, in brown
          silks, turned up their noses worse than ever nature
          had done it for them, and Mrs. Ducie heaved an
          audible sigh. "The poor motherless girl is to be
          pitied, my dears," she whispered; "she has nobody to
          point out to her suitable attire: this ridiculous
          decking out must have been Marvel's idea."</p>
  <p>But she looked like a lily amidst poppies and sunflowers,
          whether the "decking out" was ridiculous or not. Was
          Lord Mount Severn right, when he accused her of so
          dressing in self-gratification? Very likely: for,
          has not the great preacher said, that childhood and
          youth are vanity?</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle, the justice, and Barbara also had seats
          near the orchestra, for Miss Carlyle in West Lynne
          was a person to be considered, and not hidden behind
          others. Mr. Carlyle, however, preferred to join the
          gentlemen who congregated and stood round about the
          door, inside and out. There was scarcely standing
          room in the place: Mr. Kane had, as was anticipated,
          a bumper, and the poor man could have worshipped
          Lady Isabel, for he knew he owed it to her.</p>
  <p>It was very long: country concerts generally are: and was
          about three parts over when a powdered head, larger
          than any cauliflower ever grown, was discerned
          ascending the stairs behind the group of gentlemen;
          which head, when it brought its body in full view,
          was discovered to belong to one of the footmen of
          Lord Mount Severn. The calves alone, cased in their
          silk <pb n="117"/> stockings, were a sight to be
          seen; and these calves betook themselves inside the
          concert-room, with a deprecatory bow for permission
          to the gentlemen they had to steer through, and
          there they came to a stand-still, the cauliflower
          extending forward, and turning itself about from
          right to left.</p>
  <p>"Well, I'll be jiffied!" cried an astonished old
          foxhunter, who had been elbowed by the footman. "The
          cheek these fellows have!"</p>
  <p>The fellow in question did not appear, however, to be
          enjoying any great amount of cheek just then, for he
          looked perplexed, humble, and uneasy. Suddenly his
          eye fell on Mr. Carlyle, and it lightened up.</p>
  <p>"Beg pardon, sir: could you happen to inform me
          whereabouts my young lady is sitting?"</p>
  <p>"At the other end of the room, near the orchestra."</p>
  <p>"I'm sure I don't know how ever I am to get to her,
          then," returned the man, more in self-soliloquy,
          than to Mr. Carlyle. "The room's choke full, and I
          don't like crushing by. My lord is taken alarmingly
          worse, sir," he explained, in an awe-struck tone:
          "it is feared he is dying."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was painfully startled.</p>
  <p>"His screams of pain are awful, sir. Mr. Wainwright and
          another doctor from West Lynne are with him, and an
          express has gone to Lynneborough for physicians.
          Mrs. Mason said we were to fetch my young lady home,
          and not lose a moment; and we brought the carriage,
          sir, Wells galloping his horses all the way."</p>
  <p>"I will bring Lady Isabel," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I'm sure, sir, I should be under everlasting obligation
          if you would," returned the man.</p>
  <pb n="118"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle worked his way through the crowded room, he
          was tall and slender, many looking daggers at him,
          for a pathetic song was just then being given by the
          London lady. He disregarded all, and stood before
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I thought you were not coming to speak to me to-night.
          Is it not a famous room! I am so pleased."</p>
  <p>"More than famous, Lady Isabel. But," continued he
          gravely, "Lord Mount Severn does not find himself so
          well, and he has sent the carriage for you."</p>
  <p>"Papa not so well!" she quickly exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"Not quite. At any rate, he wishes you to go home. Will
          you allow me to pilot you through the room?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, my dear, considerate papa!" she laughed. "He fears I
          shall be weary, and would emancipate me before the
          time. Thank you, Mr. Carlyle, but I will wait till
          the conclusion."</p>
  <p>"No, no, Lady Isabel, it is not that. Lord Mount Severn
          is indeed worse."</p>
  <p>Her countenance changed to seriousness; but she was not
          alarmed. "Very well. When this song is over: not to
          disturb the room."</p>
  <p>"I think you had better lose no time," he urged. "Never
          mind the song and the room."</p>
  <p>She rose instantly, and put her arm within Mr. Carlyle's.
          A hasty word of explanation to Mrs. Ducie, and he
          led her away, the room, in its surprise, making for
          them what space it might. Many an eye followed them,
          but none more curiously and eagerly than Barbara
          Hare's. "Where is he going to take her?"
          involuntarily uttered Barbara.</p>
  <p>"How should I know?" retorted Miss Corny. "Barbara, you
          have done nothing but fidget all the <pb n="119"/>
          night: what's the matter with you? Folks come to a
          concert to listen, not to talk and fidget."</p>
  <p>Isabel's mantle was procured from the ante-room, where it
          had been left, and she descended the stairs with Mr.
          Carlyle. The carriage was drawn up close to the
          entrance, and the coachman had his reins gathered
          ready to start. The footman, not the one who had
          gone up-stairs, threw open the chariot door as soon
          as he saw her. He was new in the service; a simple
          country native, just engaged. She withdrew her arm
          from Mr. Carlyle's, and stood a moment before
          stepping in, looking at the man.</p>
  <p>"Is papa much worse?"</p>
  <p>"Oh yes, my lady: he was screaming shocking. But they
          think he'll live till morning."</p>
  <p>With a sharp cry, she seized the arm of Mr. Carlyle,
          seized it for support in her shock of agony. Mr.
          Carlyle rudely thrust the man away: he could
          willingly have flung him at full length on the
          pavement.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Mr. Carlyle, why did you not tell me?" she
          shivered.</p>
  <p>"My dear Lady Isabel, I am grieved that you are told now.
          But, take comfort: you know how ill he frequently
          is, and this may be but an ordinary attack. Step in.
          I trust we shall find it nothing more."</p>
  <p>"Are you going home with me?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly. I shall not leave you to go alone."</p>
  <p>She moved to the other side of the chariot, making room
          for him.</p>
  <p>"Thank you: I will sit outside."</p>
  <p>"But the night is cold."</p>
  <p>"Oh no." He closed the door, and took his seat by the
          coachman: the footmen got up behind, and the <pb n="120"/> carriage sped away. Isabel gathered
          herself into her corner, and moaned aloud in her
          suspense and helplessness.</p>
  <p>"Do not spare your horses," said Mr. Carlyle to Wells.
          "Lady Isabel will be ill with anxiety."</p>
  <p>"She'll be worse before morning, poor child," returned
          the coachman. "I have lived in the service fifteen
          year, sir, and have watched her grow up from a
          little thing," he hastened to add, as if in apology
          for his familiarity.</p>
  <p>"Is the earl really in danger?"</p>
  <p>"Ay, sir, that he is. I have seen two cases in my life of
          gout in the stomach, and a few hours closed both. I
          heard a word dropped, as I came out, that Mr.
          Wainwright thought it was going on to the
          heart."</p>
  <p>"The earl's former attacks have been alarming and
          painful," remarked Mr. Carlyle, clinging to
          hope.</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir, I know; but this bout is different. Besides,"
          resumed Wells, in a confidential tone, "them bats
          didn't come for nothing."</p>
  <p>"Bats!" uttered Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"And it's a sure sign, sir, that death is on its road to
          the house, safe and speedy."</p>
  <p>"Wells, what are you talking about?"</p>
  <p>"The bats have been round the house this evening, sir.
          Nasty things! I hate 'em at all times."</p>
  <p>"Bats are fond of flying about at night-time," remarked
          Mr. Carlyle, glancing aside at the steady old
          coachman with a half suspicion that he might not
          have been keeping himself quite so steady as usual.
          "It is their nature."</p>
  <p>"But they don't come in shoals, sir, round about you, and
          in at the windows. To-night, when we got <pb n="121"/> back, after leaving my young lady at the concert,
          I told Joe just to take out the horses and leave the
          carriage outside, as it would be required again. I
          went in-doors, and there they told me that Mrs.
          Mason wanted me, and I was to go up to the library
          to her. She was sitting there, sir, you see, to be
          close at hand, if anything was needed in my lord's
          room. So I wiped my shoes, and up to the library I
          went, and knocked at the door. 'Come in,' she called
          out, and in I walked, and there she was by herself,
          standing at the open window. 'You are airy to-night,
          ma'am,' says I; 'it's hardly weather for open
          windows:' for, as you see, sir, it's quite a
          frost."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced down at the road and at the
          hedges.</p>
  <p>"'Come in, Wells,' Mrs. Mason called out, sharply, 'come
          and look here.' I went and stood by her side, sir,
          and I never saw such a sight in my life. The bats
          were flying about in scores, in hundreds, a cloud of
          them, diving down at the window, and flapping their
          wings. Right inside they came, and would have
          touched our faces, only we drew back. Where on earth
          they had come from, I can't think, for I had not
          been in-doors a minute, and there was not one about
          outside, that I had seen. 'What does all this mean,
          Wells?' cried Mrs. Mason, 'the bats must have turned
          wild to-night. I opened the window to look at them,
          for they quite startled me. Did you ever see them so
          thick?' 'No, ma'am, nor so near,' I answered her.
          'And I don't like to see them, for it betokens no
          good: it's a sign.' Well, sir, with that she burst
          out laughing," continued Wells, "for she's one of
          those who ridicule signs and dreams, and the like.
          She's an educated <pb n="122"/> woman, perhaps you
          know, sir, and, years ago, was nursery governess to
          Lady Isabel; and those educated people are mighty
          hard of belief."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle nodded.</p>
  <p>"'What is it a sign of, Wells?' Mrs. Mason went on to me,
          in a jesting sort of way. 'Mrs. Mason, ma'am,' said
          I, 'I can't say that I ever saw the bats clanned
          together and making their visit, like this; but I
          have heard, times out of number, that they have been
          known to do it, and that it is a sure sign death is
          at the very door of the house.' 'I hope death is not
          at the door of this house,' sighed Mrs. Mason,
          thinking, no doubt, of my lord, and she closed the
          window as she spoke, and the nasty things beat
          against it with their wings. Mrs. Mason then spoke
          to me of the business she had wanted me upon; she
          was talking to me three minutes, perhaps, and when
          she had finished, I turned to look at the window
          again. But there was not a single bat there; they
          had all gone, all disappeared in that little space
          of time. 'What has become of them?' cried Mrs.
          Mason; and I opened the window, and looked up and
          down, but they were clean gone, and the air and the
          sky were as clear as they are at this moment."</p>
  <p>"Gone to flap at somebody else's window, perhaps,"
          remarked Mr. Carlyle, with a very disbelieving
          smile.</p>
  <p>"Not long after that, sir, the house was in commotion. My
          lord was in mortal agony, and Mr. Wainwright said
          (so the word ran in the servants'-hall) that the
          gout had reached the stomach, and might be rushing
          on to the heart. Denis went galloping off to
          Lynneborough for physicians, and we put-to the
          horses and came tearing off for my young lady."</p>
  <pb n="123"/>
  <p>"Well," observed Mr. Carlyle, "I hope he will recover the
          attack, Wells, in spite of the gout and the
          bats."</p>
  <p>The coachman shook his head, and turning his horses
          sharply round, whipped them up through the lodge
          gates.</p>
  <p>The housekeeper, Mrs. Mason, waited at the hall door to
          receive Lady Isabel. Mr. Carlyle helped her out of
          the carriage, and gave her his arm up the steps. She
          scarcely dared to inquire.</p>
  <p>"Is he better? May I go to his room?" she panted.</p>
  <p>Yes, the earl was better; better, in so far as that he
          was quiet and senseless. She moved hastily towards
          his chamber. Mr. Carlyle drew the housekeeper
          aside.</p>
  <p>"Is there any hope?"</p>
  <p>"Not the slightest, sir. He is dying."</p>
  <p>The earl knew no one: pain was gone for the present, and
          he lay on his bed, calm; but his face, which had
          death in it all too plainly, startled Isabel. She
          did not scream or cry; she was perfectly quiet, save
          that she had a fit of shivering. "Will he soon be
          better?" she whispered to Mr. Wainwright, who stood
          there.</p>
  <p>The surgeon coughed. "Well, he—he—we must hope it, my
          lady."</p>
  <p>"But why does his face look like that? It is pale— grey:
          I never saw anybody else look so."</p>
  <p>"He has been in great pain, my lady; and pain leaves its
          traces on the countenance."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, who had come in and was standing by the
          surgeon, touched his arm to draw him from the room.
          He noticed the look on the earl's face, and did not
          like it; he wished to question the surgeon. Lady <pb n="124"/> Isabel saw that Mr. Carlyle was about to
          quit the room, and beckoned to him.</p>
  <p>"Do not leave the house, Mr. Carlyle. When he wakes up,
          it may cheer him to see you here; he liked you very
          much."</p>
  <p>"I will not leave it, Lady Isabel. I did not think of
          doing so."</p>
  <p>In time—it seemed an age—the medical men arrived from
          Lynneborough; three of them; the groom had thought
          he could not summons too many. It was a strange
          scene they entered upon: the ghastly peer, growing
          restless again now, battling with his departing
          spirit; and the gala robes, the sparkling gems
          adorning the young girl, watching at his side. They
          comprehended the case without difficulty: that she
          had been suddenly called from some scene of
          gaiety.</p>
  <p>They stooped to look at the earl, and felt his pulse, and
          touched his heart, and exchanged a few murmured
          words with Mr. Wainwright. Isabel had stood back to
          give them place, but her anxious eyes followed their
          every movement. They did not seem to notice her, and
          she stepped forward.</p>
  <p>"Can you do anything for him? Will he recover?"</p>
  <p>They all turned at the address, and looked at her. One
          spoke: it was an evasive answer.</p>
  <p>"Tell me the truth," she implored, with feverish
          impatience; "you must not trifle with me. Do you not
          know me? I am his only child, and I am here
          alone."</p>
  <p>The first thing was to get her away from the room, for
          the great change was approaching, and the parting
          struggle between the body and the spirit might be
          one of warfare; no sight for her. But, in answer to
          their suggestions that she should go, she only
          leaned her <pb n="125"/> head upon the pillow by her
          father, and moaned in despair.</p>
  <p>"She must be got out of the room," cried one of the
          physicians, almost angrily. "Ma'am"—turning suddenly
          upon Mrs. Mason—"are there are no relatives in the
          house, no one, who can exert influence over the
          young lady?"</p>
  <p>"She has scarcely any relatives in the world," replied
          the housekeeper; "no near ones. And we happen to be,
          just now, quite alone."</p>
  <p>But Mr. Carlyle, seeing the urgency of the case, for the
          earl with every minute grew more excited, approached
          and whispered her. "You are as anxious as we can be
          for your father's recovery."</p>
  <p>" <hi>As</hi> anxious!" she uttered, reproachfully.</p>
  <p>"You know what I would imply. Of course our anxiety can
          be as nothing to yours."</p>
  <p>"As nothing; <hi>as nothing</hi> . I think my heart will
          break."</p>
  <p>"Then—forgive me—you should not oppose the wishes of his
          medical attendants. They wish to be alone with him;
          and time is being lost."</p>
  <p>She rose up; she placed her hands on her brow as if to
          collect the sense of the words; and then she
          addressed the doctors.</p>
  <p>"Is it really necessary that I should leave the room;
          necessary <hi>for him?</hi> "</p>
  <p>"It is necessary, my lady; absolutely essential."</p>
  <p>She quitted the room without another word, and turned
          into the library, an apartment in the same wing,
          where the bats had paid their visits earlier in the
          evening. A large fire burnt in the grate, and she
            <pb n="126"/> walked up to it, and leaned her hand
          and forehead on the mantel-piece.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle," she said, without raising it.</p>
  <p>"I am here," he answered, for he had followed her in.
          "What can I do for you?"</p>
  <p>"I have come away, you see. Until I may go in again will
          you bring me word how he is—continually?"</p>
  <p>"Indeed I will."</p>
  <p>As he quitted the room, Marvel sailed into it, a very
          fine lady's maid. "Would my lady change her
          dress?"</p>
  <p>No, my lady would not. "They might be calling me to papa
          at the moment the dress was off."</p>
  <p>"But so very unsuitable, my lady—that rich dress for a
          night scene, such as this."</p>
  <p>"Unsuitable! What does it signify? Who thinks of my
          dress?"</p>
  <p>But, bye-and-bye, Mrs. Mason quietly took off the
          diamonds, and threw a warm shawl over her neck and
          arms, for she was shivering still.</p>
  <p>Some of the medical men left; Mr. Wainwright remained.
          Nothing more could be done for Lord Mount Severn in
          this world, and the death scene was prolonged and
          terrible. He was awake to pain again of some sort;
          whether of mind or body they could not say. Pain!
          mortal, shrieking, writhing agony. Is it, or is it
          not the case, that a badly-spent life entails one of
          these awful death-beds?</p>
  <p>Very rebellious, very excited grew Isabel towards
          morning. Mr. Carlyle had brought her perpetual
          tidings from the sick-room, softening down the
          actual facts. She could not understand that she need
          be <pb n="127"/> kept away from it, and she had
          nearly a battle with Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It is cruel, so to treat me," she exclaimed, pride alone
          enabling her to suppress her sobs. "Pent up here,
          the night has seemed to me as long as ten. When your
          father was dying, were you kept away from him?"</p>
  <p>"My dear young lady—a hardy, callous man may go where you
          may not."</p>
  <p>"You are not hardy and callous."</p>
  <p>"I spoke of man's general nature."</p>
  <p>"I shall act upon my own responsibility. I am obliged by
          all your kindness, Mr. Carlyle," she hastily added,
          "but you really have no right to keep me from my
          father. And I shall go to him."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle placed himself before her, his back against
          the door. His grave, kind face looked into hers with
          the deepest sympathy and tenderness. "Forgive me,
          dear Lady Isabel; I cannot let you go."</p>
  <p>She broke into a passion of tears and sobs as he led her
          back to the fire, and stood there with her.</p>
  <p>"He is my dear father, I have but him in the wide
          world."</p>
  <p>"I know; I know: I feel for you all that you are feeling.
          Twenty times this night I have wished, forgive me
          the thought, that you were my sister, so that I
          might express my sympathy more freely, and comfort
          you."</p>
  <p>"Tell me the truth, then, why I am kept away. If you can
          show me a sufficient cause, I will be reasonable and
          obey; but do not say again I should be disturbing
          him, for it is not true."</p>
  <p>"He is too ill for you to see him, his symptoms are <pb n="128"/> too painful; were you to go in, in
          defiance of advice, you would regret it all your
          after life."</p>
  <p>"Is he dying?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle hesitated. Ought he to dissemble with her as
          the doctors had done? A strong feeling was upon him
          that he ought not.</p>
  <p>"I trust to you not to deceive me," she simply said.</p>
  <p>"I fear he is. I believe he is."</p>
  <p>She rose up; she grasped his arm in the sudden fear that
          flashed over her. "You are deceiving me, and he is
          dead!"</p>
  <p>"I am not deceiving you, Lady Isabel. He is not dead:
          but—it may be very near."</p>
  <p>She laid her face down upon the sofa pillow. "Going for
          ever from me! going for ever. Oh, Mr. Carlyle, let
          me see him for a minute! just one farewell! will you
          not try for me?"</p>
  <p>He knew how hopeless it was, but he turned to leave the
          room. "I will go and see. But you will remain here
          quietly: you will not come."</p>
  <p>She bowed her head in acquiescence, and he closed the
          door. Had she indeed been his sister, he would
          probably have turned the key upon her. He entered
          the earl's chamber, but not many seconds did he
          remain in it.</p>
  <p>"It is over," he whispered to Mrs. Mason, whom he met in
          the corridor. "And Mr. Wainwright is asking for
          you."</p>
  <p>"You are soon back," cried Isabel, lifting her head. "May
          I go?"</p>
  <p>He sat down and took her hand, shrinking from his task.
          "I wish I could comfort you!" he exclaimed, in a
          tone of deep emotion.</p>
  <pb n="129"/>
  <p>Her face turned of a ghastly whiteness, as white as
          another's not far away. "Tell me the worst," she
          breathed.</p>
  <p>"I have nothing to tell you, but the worst. May God
          support you, dear Lady Isabel!"</p>
  <p>She turned to hide her face and its misery from him, and
          a low wail of anguish broke from her, betraying its
          own tale of despair.</p>
  <p>The grey dawn of morning was breaking over the world,
          advent of another bustling day in life's history;
          but the spirit of William Vane, Earl of Mount
          Severn, had soared away from it for ever.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER X. THE KEEPERS OF THE DEAD.</head>
  <p><hi>Events</hi> , between the death of Lord Mount Severn
          and his interment, occurred quickly; to one of them
          the reader may feel inclined to demur, as believing
          that it could have no foundation in fact, in the
          actions of real life. He would be wrong. The
          circumstance really occurred.</p>
  <p>The earl died on Friday morning, at daylight. The news
          spread rapidly; it generally does, on the death of a
          peer, if he have been of note (whether good or bad)
          in the world. It was known in London before the day
          was over; the consequence of which was, that by
          Saturday morning early, a shoal of what the late
          earl would have called harpies, had arrived to
          surround East Lynne. There were creditors for small
          sums and for great, for five or ten pounds, up to
          five or ten thousand. Some were civil; some,
          impatient; some, loud and rough and angry; some came
          to put in executions on the effects, and some—
            <hi>to arrest the body!</hi></p>
  <p>This last act was accomplished cleverly. Two men, each
          with a remarkably hooked nose, stole away from the
          hubbub of the clamourers, and, peering cunningly
          about, made their way to the side, or tradesman's
            <pb n="131"/> entrance. A kitchen-maid answered
          their gentle appeal at the bell.</p>
  <p>"Is the coffin come yet?" said they.</p>
  <p>"Coffin? no!" was the girl's reply. "The shell ain't here
          yet. Mr. Jones didn't promise that till nine
          o'clock, and it haven't gone eight."</p>
  <p>"It won't be long," quoth they, "it's on its road. We'll
          go up to his lordship's room, and be getting ready
          for it."</p>
  <p>The girl called the butler. "Two men from Jones's, the
          undertaker's, sir," announced she. "The shell's a
          coming on, and they want to go up and make ready for
          it."</p>
  <p>The butler marshalled them up-stairs himself, and
          introduced them to the room. "That will do," said
          they, as he was about to enter with them, "we won't
          trouble you to wait." And, closing the door upon the
          unsuspicious butler, they took up their station on
          either side the dead, like a couple of ill-omened
          mutes. They had placed an arrest upon the corpse; it
          was theirs, until their claim was satisfied, and
          they sat down to thus watch and secure it. Pleasant
          occupation!</p>
  <p>It may have been an hour later that Lady Isabel, leaving
          her own chamber, opened noiselessly that of the
          dead. She had been in it several times the previous
          day; at first with the housekeeper; afterwards, when
          the nameless dread was somewhat effaced, alone. But
          she felt nervous again this morning, and had gained
          the bed before she ventured to lift her eyes from
          the carpet and encounter the sight. Then she
          started, for there sat two strange-looking men—and
          not attractive men, either.</p>
  <pb n="132"/>
  <p>It darted through her mind that they must be people from
          the neighbourhood, come to gratify an idle and
          unpardonable curiosity: her first impulse was to
          summons the butler; her second, to speak to them
          herself.</p>
  <p>"Do you want anything here?" she quietly said.</p>
  <p>"Much obleeged for the inquiry, miss. We are all
          right."</p>
  <p>The words and the tone struck her as being singular in
          the extreme: and they kept their seats, too, as
          though they had a right to be there.</p>
  <p>"Why are you here?" she repeated. "What are you
          doing?"</p>
  <p>"Well, miss, I don't mind telling you, for I suppose you
          are his daughter"—pointing his left thumb over his
          shoulder at the late peer—"and we hear he have got
          no other relative anigh him. We have been obleeged,
          miss, to perform a unpleasant dooty, and secure
          him."</p>
  <p>The words were like Greek to her: and the men saw that
          they were.</p>
  <p>"He unfort'nately owed a sight of money, miss—as you
          perhaps be aware on, and our employers is in, deep.
          So, as soon as they heard what had happened, they
          sent us down to arrest the dead corpse: and we have
          done it."</p>
  <p>Amazement, horror, fear, struggled together in the
          shocked mind of Lady Isabel. Arrest the dead! She
          had never heard of a like calamity: nor could she
          have believed in such. Arrest it for what purpose?
          What to do? To disfigure it?—to sell it? With a
          panting heart and ashy lips she turned from the
          room. Mrs. Mason happened to be passing near the
          stairs, and <pb n="133"/> Isabel flew to her, laying
          hold of her with both hands in her terror, as she
          burst into a fit of nervous tears.</p>
  <p>"Those men—in there!" she gasped.</p>
  <p>"What men, my lady?" returned Mrs. Mason, in
          surprise.</p>
  <p>"I don't know; I don't know. I think they are going to
          stop there: they say they have taken papa."</p>
  <p>After a pause of bewildered astonishment, the housekeeper
          left her standing where she was, and went to the
          earl's chamber, to see if she could fathom the
          mystery of the words. Isabel leaned against the
          balustrades; partly for support, partly that she
          seemed afraid to stir from them; and the ominous
          disturbance, down stairs, reached her ears.
          Strangers, interlopers, appeared to be in the hall,
          talking vehemently, and complaining in bitter tones.
          More and more terrified, she held her breath to
          listen.</p>
  <p>"Where's the good of your seeing the young lady?" cried
          the butler, in a tone of remonstrance. "She knows
          nothing about the earl's affairs; she is in grief
          enough, just now, without any other worry."</p>
  <p>"I will see her," retorted a dogged voice. "If she's too
          start-up and mighty to come down and answer a
          question or two, why I'll find my way on to her.
          Here we are, a shameful crowd of us, swindled out of
          our own, told there's nobody we can speak to; nobody
          here but the young lady, and she must not be
          troubled! She didn't find it trouble to help to
          spend our money! She has got no honour and no
          feelings of a lady, if she don't come and speak to
          us."</p>
  <p>Repressing her rebellious emotion, Lady Isabel glided
          partly down the staircase, and softly called to the
          butler.</p>
  <p>"What is all this?" she asked. "I must know."</p>
  <pb n="134"/>
  <p>"Oh, my lady, don't go amongst those rough men! You
          cannot do any good; pray go back before they see
          you. I have sent for Mr. Carlyle, and expect him
          here every moment."</p>
  <p>"Did papa owe them <hi>all</hi> money?" she shivered.</p>
  <p>"I'm afraid he did, my lady."</p>
  <p>She went swiftly on; and, passing through the few
          stragglers in the hall, entered the dining-room,
          where the chief mass had congregated, and the hubbub
          was loudest. All anger, at least all external anger,
          was hushed at her sight. She looked so young, so
          innocent, so childlike in her pretty morning dress
          of peachcoloured muslin, her fair face shaded by its
          falling curls, so little fit to combat with, or
          understand <hi>their</hi> business, that instead of
          pouring forth complaints, they hushed them into
          silence.</p>
  <p>"I heard some one calling out that I ought to see you,"
          she began, her agitation causing the words to come
          forth in a jerking manner. "What did you want with
          me?"</p>
  <p>Then they poured out their complaints, but not angrily,
          and she listened till she grew sick. There were many
          and formidable claims; promissory notes and IOUs,
          overdue bills and underdue bills; heavy outstanding
          debts of all sorts, and trifles (comparatively
          speaking) for housekeeping, servants' liveries,
          out-door servants' wages, bread and meat.</p>
  <p>What was Isabel Vane to answer? what excuse to offer?
          what hope or promise to give? She stood in
          bewilderment, unable to speak, turning from one to
          the other, her sweet eyes full of pity and
          contrition.</p>
  <p>"The fact is, young lady," said one who bore the exterior
          of a gentleman, "we should not have come <pb n="135"/> down to trouble you—at least, I can answer for
          myself —but his lordship's men of business,
          Warburton and Ware, to whom many of us hastened last
          evening, told us there would not be a shilling for
          anybody, unless it could be got from the furniture.
          When it comes to that, it is, 'first come, first
          served, and I got down by morning light, and levied
          an execution."</p>
  <p>"Which was levied before you came," put in a man, who
          might be brother to the two up-stairs, to judge by
          his nose. "But what's such furniture as this, to our
          claims—if you come to combine 'em? no more than a
          bucket of water is to the Thames."</p>
  <p>"What can I do?" shivered Lady Isabel. "What is it you
          wish me to do? I have no money to give you. I—"</p>
  <p>"No, miss," broke in a quiet, pale man; "if report tells
          true, you are worse wronged than we are, for you
          won't have a roof to put your head under, or a
          guinea to call your own."</p>
  <p>"He has been a scoundrel to everybody," interrupted an
          intemperate voice; "he has ruined thousands."</p>
  <p>The speech was hissed down: even they were not men,
          gratuitously to insult a delicate young lady.</p>
  <p>"Perhaps you'll just answer us a question, miss,"
          persisted the voice, in spite of the hisses. "Is
          there any ready money that can—"</p>
  <p>But another person had entered the room—Mr. Carlyle. He
          caught sight of the white face and trembling hands
          of Isabel, and interrupted the last speaker with
          scant ceremony.</p>
  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he demanded, in a tone of
          authority. "What do you want?"</p>
  <p>"If you are a friend of the late peer's, you ought to <pb n="136"/> know what we want," was the response.
          "We want our debts paid."</p>
  <p>"But this is not the place to come to," returned Mr.
          Carlyle: "your flocking here, in this extraordinary
          manner, will do no good. You must go to Warburton
          and Ware."</p>
  <p>"We have been to them—and received their answer. A cool
          assurance that there'll be nothing for anybody."</p>
  <p>"At any rate, you will get nothing here," observed Mr.
          Carlyle, to the assembly collectively. "Allow me to
          request you to leave the house at once."</p>
  <p>It was little likely that they would go for his bidding.
          And they said it.</p>
  <p>"Then I warn you of the consequences of a refusal,"
          quietly said Mr. Carlyle: "you are trespassing upon
          a stranger's property. This house was not Lord Mount
          Severn's: he sold it some time back."</p>
  <p>They knew better. Some laughed, and said these tricks
          were stale.</p>
  <p>"Listen, gentlemen," rejoined Mr. Carlyle, in the plain,
          straightforward manner that carried its own truth.
          "To make an assertion that could be disproved when
          the earl's affairs came to be investigated, would be
          simply foolish. I give you my word of honour as a
          man—that this estate, with the house and all that it
          contains, passed legally, months ago, from the hands
          of Lord Mount Severn: and, during his recent sojourn
          here, he was but a visitor in it. Go and ask his men
          of business."</p>
  <p>"Who purchased it?" was the inquiry.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle, of West Lynne. Some of you may possibly
          know him by reputation."</p>
  <pb n="137"/>
  <p>Some of them did. "A cute young lawyer," observed a
          voice; "as his father was before him."</p>
  <p>"I am he," proceeded Mr. Carlyle. "And being a 'cute
          lawyer,' as you do me the honour to decide, you
          cannot suppose I should risk my money upon any sale,
          not perfectly safe and legal. I was not an agent in
          the affair; I employed agents: for it was my own
          money that I invested, and East Lynne is mine."</p>
  <p>"Is the purchase-money paid over?" inquired more than
          one.</p>
  <p>"It was paid over at the time: last June."</p>
  <p>"What did Lord Mount Severn do with the money?"</p>
  <p>"I do not know," replied Mr. Carlyle. "I am not cognisant
          of Lord Mount Severn's private affairs."</p>
  <p>Significant murmurs arose: "Strange that the earl should
          stop two or three months at a place that wasn't
          his!"</p>
  <p>"It may appear so to you, but allow me to explain,"
          returned Mr. Carlyle. "The earl expressed a wish to
          pay East Lynne a few days' visit, by way of
          farewell, and I acceded. Before the few days were
          over, he was taken ill, and remained, from that
          time, too ill to quit it. This very day, this day,
          gentlemen, was at length fixed for his
          departure."</p>
  <p>"And you tell us you bought the furniture!"</p>
  <p>"Everything as it stands. You need not doubt my word, for
          the proofs will be forthcoming. East Lynne was in
          the market for sale: I heard of it, and became the
          purchaser—just as I might have bought an estate from
          any of you. And now, as this is my house, and you
          have no claim upon me, I shall be obliged to you to
          withdraw."</p>
  <pb n="138"/>
  <p>"Perhaps you will claim the horses and carriages next,
          sir," cried the man with the hooked nose.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle lifted his head haughtily. "What is mine, is
          mine; legally purchased and paid for; a fair, just
          price. The carriages and horses I have nothing to do
          with: Lord Mount Severn brought them down with
          him."</p>
  <p>"And I have got a safe watcher over them in the out
          premises, to see as they don't run away," nodded the
          man, complacently: "and, if I dont mistake, there's
          a safe watcher over something else up-stairs."</p>
  <p>"What a cursed scoundrel Mount Severn was!"</p>
  <p>"Whatever he may have been, it does not give you the
          right to outrage the feelings of his daughter,"
          warmly interrupted Mr. Carlyle: "and I should have
          thought that men, calling themselves Englishmen,
          would have disdained the shame. Allow me, Lady
          Isabel," he added, imperatively taking her hand to
          lead her from the room. "I will remain and deal with
          this business."</p>
  <p>But she hesitated, and stopped. The injury her father had
          done these men was telling painfully on her sense of
          right, and she essayed to speak a word of apology,
          of sorrow: she thought she ought to do so; she did
          not like them to deem her quite heartless. But it
          was a painful task, and the colour went and came in
          her pale face, and her breath was laboured with the
          excess of her tribulation.</p>
  <p>"I am very sorry," she stammered; and, with the effort of
          speaking, emotion quite got the better of her, and
          she burst into tears. "I did not know anything of
          all this: my father's affairs were not spoken of
          before me. I believe I have not anything: if I had,
          I <pb n="139"/> would divide it amongst you as
          equally as I could. But, should the means ever be in
          my power, should money ever be mine, I will
          thankfully pay all your claims."</p>
  <p><hi>All</hi> your claims! Lady Isabel little thought what
          that "all" would comprise. However, such promises,
          made at such a moment, fall heedlessly on the ear.
          Scarcely one present but felt sympathy and sorrow
          for her, and Mr. Carlyle drew her from the room. He
          closed the door upon the noisy crew, and then her
          sobs came forth hysterically.</p>
  <p>"I am so grieved, Lady Isabel! Had I foreseen this
          annoyance, you should have been spared it. Can you
          go up-stairs alone?—or shall I call Mrs. Mason?"</p>
  <p>"Oh yes, I can go alone: I am not ill, only frightened
          and sick. This is not the worst," she shivered.
          "There are two men up—up—with—with papa."</p>
  <p>Up with papa! Mr. Carlyle was puzzled. He saw that she
          was shaking from head to foot as she stood before
          him.</p>
  <p>"I cannot understand it, and it terrifies me," she
          continued, attempting an explanation. "They are
          sitting in the room, close to him; they have taken
          him, they say."</p>
  <p>A blank, thunderstruck pause. Mr. Carlyle looked at her,
          he did not speak; and then he turned and looked at
          the butler, who was standing near. But the man only
          responded by giving his head a half-shake, and Mr.
          Carlyle saw that it was an ominous one.</p>
  <p>"I will clear the house of these," he said to Lady
          Isabel, pointing back to the dining-room, "and then
          join you up-stairs."</p>
  <p>"Two ruffians, sir, and they have got possession of <pb n="140"/> the body," whispered the butler into Mr.
          Carlyle's ear, as Lady Isabel departed. "They
          obtained entrance to the chamber by a sly, deceitful
          trick, saying they were the undertakers' men, and
          that he can't be buried, unless their claims are
          paid, if it's for a month to come. It has upset all
          our stomachs, sir; Mrs. Mason, while telling me—for
          she was the first to know it—was as sick as she
          could be."</p>
  <p>At present Mr. Carlyle returned to the dining-room, and
          bore the brunt of the anger of those savage, and— it
          may be said—ill used men. Not that it was vented
          upon him; quite the contrary; but on the memory of
          the unhappy peer, who lay overhead. A few had taken
          the precaution to ensure the earl's life, and they
          were the best off. They left the house after a short
          space of time, for Mr. Carlyle's statement was
          indisputable, and they knew the law better than to
          remain, trespassers, on his property.</p>
  <p>But the custodians of the dead could not be so got rid
          of. Mr. Carlyle proceeded to the death-chamber, and
          examined their authority. A similar case had never
          occurred under his own observation: though it had
          under his father's, and Mr. Carlyle remembered
          hearing of it. The body of a church dignitary, who
          had died deeply in debt, was arrested as it was
          being carried through the cloisters to its grave in
          the cathedral. These men, sitting over Lord Mount
          Severn, enforced heavy claims, and there they must
          sit, until the arrival of Mr. Vane from Castle
          Marling—now the Earl of Mount Severn.</p>
  <p>On the following morning, Sunday, Mr. Carlyle proceeded
          again to East Lynne, and found, to his surprise,
          that there was no arrival. Isabel was in the
          breakfast-room <pb n="141"/> alone, the meal on the
          table untouched, and she shivering—on a low ottoman
          before the fire. She looked so ill, that Mr. Carlyle
          could not forbear remarking upon it.</p>
  <p>"I have not slept, and I am very cold," she answered. "I
          did not close my eyes all night; I was too
          terrified."</p>
  <p>"Terrified at what?" he asked.</p>
  <p>"At those men," she whispered. "It is strange that Mr.
          Vane is not come."</p>
  <p>"Is the post in?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know," she apathetically replied. "I have
          received nothing."</p>
  <p>She had scarcely spoken when the butler entered with his
          salver full of letters; most of them bearing
          condolence to Lady Isabel. She singled out one, and
          hastened to opened it, for it bore the Castle
          Marling post-mark. "It is Mrs. Vane's handwriting,"
          she remarked to Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Castle Marling, Saturday.</p>
  <p>"My dear Isabel,—I am dreadfully grieved and shocked at
          the news conveyed in Mr. Carlyle's letter to my
          husband, for he is gone cruising in his yacht, and I
          opened it. Goodness knows where he may be, round the
          coast somewhere; but he said he should be home by
          Sunday, and as he is pretty punctual generally in
          keeping his word, I expect him. Be assured he will
          not lose a moment in hastening to East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"I cannot express what I feel for you, and am too
          bouleversée to write more. Try and keep up your <pb n="142"/> spirits, and believe me, dear Isabel,
          with sincere sympathy and regret, faithfully
          yours,</p>
  <p><hi>"Emma Mount Severn</hi> ."</p>
  <p>The colour came into Isabel's pale cheek when she read
          the signature. She thought, had she been the writer,
          she should, in that first, early letter, have still
          signed herself Emma Vane. Isabel handed the note to
          Mr. Carlyle. "It is very unfortunate," she
          sighed.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced over it, as quickly as Mrs. Vane's
          illegible writing allowed him, and drew in his lips
          in a peculiar manner when he came to the signature.
          Perhaps at the same thought which had struck
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Had Mrs. Vane been worth a rush, she would have come
          herself, knowing your lonely situation," he uttered,
          impulsively.</p>
  <p>Isabel leaned her head upon her hand. All the
          difficulties and embarrassments of her position came
          crowding upon her mind. No orders had been given in
          preparation for the funeral, and she felt that she
          had no right to give any. The Earls of Mount Severn
          were buried at Mount Severn, but to take her father
          thither would involve great expense: would the
          present earl sanction that? Since the previous
          morning, she seemed to have grown old in the world's
          experiences; her ideas were changed, the bent of her
          thoughts had been violently turned from its course.
          Instead of being a young lady of high position, of
          wealth and rank, she appeared to herself more in the
          light of an unfortunate pauper; an interloper in the
          house she was inhabiting. It has been the custom in
          romance to represent young ladies, especially if
          they be handsome and interesting, as being <pb n="143"/> entirely oblivious of matter-of-fact
          cares and necessities, supremely indifferent to
          future prospects of poverty— poverty that brings
          hunger and thirst and cold and nakedness; but, be
          assured, this apathy never exists in real life.
          Isabel Vane's grief for her father—whom, whatever
          may have been the aspect he wore for others,
            <hi>she</hi> had deeply loved and reverenced—was
          sharply poignant: but in the midst of that grief,
          and of the singular troubles his death had brought
          forth, she could not shut her eyes to her own
          future. Its uncertainty, its shadowed-forth
          embarrassments did obtrude themselves, and the words
          of that plain-speaking creditor kept ringing in her
          ears—"You won't have a roof to put your head under,
          or a guinea to call your own." Where was she to
          go?—with whom to live? she was in Mr. Carlyle's
          house now. And how was she to pay the servants?
          Money was owing to them all.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle, how long has this house been yours?" she
          asked, breaking the silence.</p>
  <p>"It was in June that the purchase was completed. Did Lord
          Mount Severn never tell you he had sold it to
          me?"</p>
  <p>"No; never. All these things are yours?" glancing round
          the room.</p>
  <p>"The furniture was sold with the house. Not these sort of
          things," he added, his eye falling on the silver on
          the breakfast-table, "not the plate and linen."</p>
  <p>"Not the plate and linen! Then those poor men, who were
          here yesterday, have a right to them," she quickly
          cried.</p>
  <p>"I scarcely know. I believe the plate goes with the
          entail—and the jewels go also. The linen cannot be
          of much consequence, either way."</p>
  <pb n="144"/>
  <p>"Are my clothes my own?"</p>
  <p>He smiled at her simplicity; and assured her that they
          were nobody else's.</p>
  <p>"I did not know," she sighed; "I did not understand. So
          many strange things have happened in the last day or
          two, that I seem to understand nothing."</p>
  <p>Indeed she could not understand. She had no definite
          ideas on the subject of this transfer of East Lynne
          to Mr. Carlyle: plenty of indefinite ones, and they
          were haunting her. Fears of debt to him, and of the
          house and its contents being handed over to him in
          liquidation, perhaps only partial, were working in
          her brain.</p>
  <p>"Does my father owe you any money?" she breathed in a
          timid tone.</p>
  <p>"Not any," he replied. "Lord Mount Severn was never
          indebted to me in his life."</p>
  <p>"Yet you purchased East Lynne!"</p>
  <p>"As any one else might have done," he answered,
          discerning the drift of her thoughts. "I was in
          search of an eligible estate to invest money in, and
          East Lynne suited me."</p>
  <p>"I feel my position, Mr. Carlyle," she resumed, the
          rebellious tears forcing themselves to her eyes,
          "thus to be intruding upon you for a shelter. And I
          cannot help myself."</p>
  <p>"You can help grieving me," he gently answered, "which
          you do when you talk of obligation. The obligation
          is on my side, Lady Isabel; and when I express a
          hope that you will continue at East Lynne while it
          can be of service, however prolonged that period may
          be, I assure you I say it in all sincerity."</p>
  <p>"You are truly kind," she faltered, "and for a few <pb n="145"/> days; until I can think; until—Oh, Mr.
          Carlyle, are papa's affairs really so bad as they
          said yesterday?" she broke off, her perplexities
          recurring to her with vehement force. "Is there
          nothing left?"</p>
  <p>Now Mr. Carlyle might have given the evasive assurance
          that there would be plenty left, just to
          tranquillise her. But to use deceit with her would
          have pricked against every feeling of his nature;
          and he saw how implicitly she relied upon his
          truth.</p>
  <p>"I fear things are not very bright," he answered. "That
          is, so far as we can see at present. But there may
          be some settlement effected for you that you do not
          know of. Warburton and Ware—"</p>
  <p>"No," she interrupted; "I never heard of a settlement,
          and I am sure there is none. I see the worst
          plainly: I have no home; no home, and no money. This
          house is yours; the town-house and Mount Severn go
          to Mr. Vane. And I have nothing."</p>
  <p>"But surely Mr. Vane will be delighted to welcome you to
          your old home. The houses pass to him—it almost
          seems as though you had the greater right in them,
          than he or Mrs. Vane."</p>
  <p>"My home with them!" she retorted, as if the words had
          stung her. "What are you saying, Mr. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"I beg your pardon, Lady Isabel. I should not have
          presumed to touch upon these points myself,
          but—"</p>
  <p>"Nay, I think I ought to beg yours," she interrupted,
          more calmly. "I am only grateful for the interest
          you take in them; the kindness you have shown. But I
          could never make my home with Mrs. Vane."</p>
  <pb n="146"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle rose. He could do no good by remaining, and
          did not think well to intrude longer. He suggested
          that it might be more pleasant if Isabel had a
          friend with her: Mrs. Ducie would, no doubt, be
          willing to come, and she was a kind and motherly
          woman.</p>
  <p>Isabel shook her head, with a passing shudder. "Have
          strangers here, with—all—that—in papa's chamber!"
          she uttered. "Mrs. Ducie drove over yesterday;
          perhaps to remain; I don't know; but I was afraid of
          questions, and would not see her. When I think
          of—that—I feel thankful that I am alone."</p>
  <p>The housekeeper stopped Mr. Carlyle as he was going out.
          "Sir, what is the news from Castle Marling? Pound
          said there was a letter. Is Mr. Vane coming?"</p>
  <p>"He was out yachting. Mrs. Vane expected him home
          yesterday, so it is to be hoped he will be here
          to-day."</p>
  <p>"Whatever will be done, if he does not come?" she
          breathed. "The leaden coffin ought to be soldered
          down—for you know, sir, the state he was in when he
          died."</p>
  <p>"It can be soldered down without Mr. Vane."</p>
  <p>"Of course—without Mr. Vane. It's not that, sir. Will
          those men allow it to be done? The undertakers were
          here this morning at day-break, and those men
          intimated that they were not going to <hi>lose
            sight</hi> of the dead. The words sounded
          significant to us, but we asked them no questions.
          Have they a right to prevent it, sir?"</p>
  <pb n="147"/>
  <p>"Upon my word I cannot tell," replied Mr. Carlyle. "The
          proceeding is so rare a one that I know little what
          right of law they have, or have not. Do not mention
          this fear to Lady Isabel. And when Mr. Va—when Lord
          Mount Severn arrives, send down to apprise me of
          it."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XI. THE NEW PEER. AND THE BANK-NOTE.</head>
  <p><hi>A Post-Chaise</hi> was driving furiously up the
          avenue that Sunday afternoon. It contained the new
          peer, Lord Mount Severn. The more direct line of
          rail from Castle Marling brought him within five
          miles of West Lynne, and thence he had travelled in
          a hired chaise. Mr. Carlyle soon joined him, and
          almost at the same time Mr. Warburton arrived from
          London. Absence from town at the period of the
          earl's death, had prevented Mr. Warburton's earlier
          attendance. Business was entered upon
          immediately.</p>
  <p>The present earl knew that his predecessor had been an
          embarrassed man, but he had no conception of the
          extent of the evil: they had not been intimate, and
          rarely came in contact. As the various items of news
          were now detailed to him—the wasteful expenditure,
          the disastrous ruin, the total absence of provision
          for Isabel, he stood petrified and aghast. He was a
          tall, stout man of three-and-forty years, his nature
          honourable, his manners cold, and his countenance
          severe.</p>
  <p>"It is the most iniquitous piece of business I ever heard
          of," he exclaimed to the two lawyers. "Of all
          reckless fools, Mount Severn must have been the
          worst!"</p>
  <pb n="149"/>
  <p>"Unpardonably improvident, as regards his daughter," was
          the assenting remark.</p>
  <p>"Improvident! it must have been rank madness," retorted
          the earl. "No man in his senses could leave a child
          to the mercy of the world, as he has left her. She
          has not a shilling; literally not a shilling in her
          possession. I put the question to her—what money
          there was in the house when the earl died. Twenty or
          twentyfive pounds, she answered, which she had since
          given to Mason, who required it for housekeeping
          purposes. If the girl wants a yard of ribbon for
          herself, she has not the pence to pay for it! Can
          you realise such a case to the mind?" continued the
          excited peer. "I will stake my veracity that such a
          one never occurred yet."</p>
  <p>"No money for her own personal wants!" exclaimed Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Not a halfpenny in the world. And there are no funds,
          and will be none, that I can see, for her to draw
          upon."</p>
  <p>"Quite correct, my lord," nodded Mr. Warburton. "The
          entailed estates go to you, and what trifling
          matters of personal property may be left, the
          creditors will take care of."</p>
  <p>"I understand East Lynne is yours," cried the earl,
          turning sharply upon Mr. Carlyle. "Isabel has just
          said so."</p>
  <p>"It is," was the reply. "It became mine last June. I
          believe his lordship kept the fact a close
          secret."</p>
  <p>"He was obliged to keep it secret," interposed Mr.
          Warburton, adressing Lord Mount Severn, "for not a
          stiver of the purchase-money could he have fingered,
          had it got wind. Except ourselves and Mr. Carlyle's
          agents, the fact was made known to none."</p>
  <pb n="150"/>
  <p>"It is strange, sir, that you could not urge the claims
          of his child upon the earl," rejoined the new peer
          to Mr. Warburton, his tone one of harsh reproof.
          "You were in his confidence, you knew the state of
          his affairs; it was in your line of duty to do
          it."</p>
  <p>"And, knowing the state of his affairs, my lord, we knew
          how useless the urging it would be," returned Mr.
          Warburton. "He had let the time slip by, when he
          could have made a provision for her: the power, to
          do so, was past, years ago. Once or twice, I have
          called it to his notice, but it was a sore point
          with him, and he would not pursue it. I do not think
          he was uneasy about her: he depended upon her making
          a good marriage during his lifetime; not expecting
          to die so young."</p>
  <p>"Out of his power!" repeated the earl, stopping in his
          impatient pacings of the room and facing Mr.
          Warburton. "Don't tell me, sir! he should have done
          something. He might have insured his life for a few
          thousands, if nothing else. The child is without
          anything; without even pocket-money! Do you
          understand?"</p>
  <p>"Unfortunately I understand, only too well," returned the
          lawyer. "But your lordship has but a faint idea of
          the burdens Lord Mount Severn had upon him. The
          interest alone on his debts was frightful—and the
          deuce's own work there used to be to get it. Not to
          speak of the kites he let loose: he would fly them,
          and nothing could stop him; and they had to be
          provided for."</p>
  <p>"Oh, I know," replied the earl, with a gesture of
          contempt. "Drawing one bill to cover another: that
          was his system."</p>
  <pb n="151"/>
  <p>"Draw!" echoed Mr. Warburton, "he would have drawn a bill
          upon Aldgate pump. It was a downright mania with
          him."</p>
  <p>"Urged to it by his necessities, I conclude," put in Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"He had no business to have such necessities, sir," cried
          the earl, wrathfully. "But let us proceed to
          business. What money is there, lying at his
          bankers', Mr. Warburton? Do you know?"</p>
  <p>"None," was the blank reply. "We overdrew the account
          ourselves, a fortnight ago, to meet one of his
          pressing liabilities. We hold a little; and, had he
          lived a week or two longer, the autumn rents would
          have been paid in—though they must have been as
          quickly paid out again."</p>
  <p>"I'm glad there's something. What is the amount?"</p>
  <p>"My lord," answered Mr. Warburton, shaking his head in a
          self-condoling manner, "I am sorry to tell you that
          what we hold will not half satisfy our own claims:
          money actually paid out of our pockets."</p>
  <p>"Then where on earth is the money to come from, sir? For
          the funeral; for the servants' wages; for
          everything, in short?"</p>
  <p>"There is none to come from anywhere," was the reply of
          Mr. Warburton.</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn strode the carpet more fiercely.
          "Wicked improvidence! shameful profligacy!
          callous-hearted man! To live a rogue, and die a
          beggar, leaving his daughter to the charity of
          strangers!"</p>
  <p>"Her case presents the worst feature of the whole,"
          remarked Mr. Carlyle. "What will she do for a
          home?"</p>
  <p>"She must, of course, find it with me," replied his <pb n="152"/> lordship. "And, I should hope, a better
          one than this. With all these debts and duns at his
          elbow, Mount Severn's house could not have been a
          bower of roses."</p>
  <p>"I fancy she knew nothing of the state of affairs; had
          seen little, if anything, of the embarrassments,"
          returned Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Nonsense!" said the peer.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle is right, my lord," observed Mr. Warburton,
          looking over his spectacles. "Lady Isabel was in
          safety at Mount Severn till the spring, and the
          purchase money from East Lynne was a stop-gap for
          many things, and made matters easy for the moment.
          However, his imprudences are at an end now."</p>
  <p>"No, they are not at an end," returned Lord Mount Severn:
          "they leave their effects behind them. I hear there
          was a fine scene yesterday morning: some of the
          unfortunate wretches he has taken in, made their
          appearance here, all the way from town."</p>
  <p>"Oh, they are Jews, half of them," slightingly spoke Mr.
          Warburton. "If they do lose a little, it will be an
          agreeable novelty to them."</p>
  <p>"Jews have as much right to their own as we have, Mr.
          Warburton," was the peer's angry reprimand. "And if
          they were Turks and infidels, it would not excuse
          Mount Severn's practices. Isabel says it was you,
          Mr. Carlyle, who contrived to get rid of them."</p>
  <p>"By convincing them that East Lynne and its furniture
          belonged to me. But there are those two men
          up-stairs, in possession of—of him: I could not get
          rid of them."</p>
  <p>The earl looked at him. "I do not understand you."</p>
  <p>"Did you not know that they have seized the corpse?"
          asked Mr. Carlyle, dropping his voice.</p>
  <pb n="153"/>
  <p>"Two men have been posted over it, like sentinels, since
          yesterday morning. And there's a third in the house,
          I hear, who relieves each by turn, that they may go
          down in the hall and take their meals."</p>
  <p>The earl had halted in his walk and drawn near to Mr.
          Carlyle, his mouth open, his face a marvel of
          consternation. "By George!" was all Mr. Warburton
          uttered, and snatched off his glasses.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle, do I understand you aright—that the body of
          the late earl has been seized for debt?" demanded
          the peer, solemnly. "Seize a dead body! Am I awake,
          or dreaming?"</p>
  <p>"It is what they have done. They got into the room by
          stratagem."</p>
  <p>"Is it possible that transactions so infamous are
          permitted by our law?" ejaculated the earl. "Arrest
          a dead man! I never heard of such a thing: I am
          shocked beyond expression. Isabel said something
          about two men, I remember: but she was so full of
          grief and agitation altogether, that I but half
          comprehended what she said upon any subject. Why,
          what will be done? Cannot we bury him?"</p>
  <p>"I fancy not. The housekeeper told me this morning, she
          feared they would not even suffer the coffins to be
          closed down. And that ought to be done with all
          convenient speed."</p>
  <p>"It is perfectly horrible," uttered the earl.</p>
  <p>"Who has done it? do you know?" inquired Mr.
          Warburton.</p>
  <p>"Somebody of the name of Anstey," replied Mr. Carlyle.
          "In the absence of any member of the family, I took
          upon myself to pay the chamber a visit, and <pb n="154"/> examine into the men's authority. The
          claim is about three thousand pounds."</p>
  <p>"If it's Anstey who has done it, it is a personal debt of
          the earl's, really owing, every pound of it,"
          observed Mr. Warburton. "A sharp man, though, that
          Anstey, to hit upon such a scheme."</p>
  <p>"And a shameless and a scandalous man," added Lord Mount
          Severn. "Well, this is a pretty thing! What's to be
          done?"</p>
  <p>While they consult, let us look for a moment at Lady
          Isabel. She sat alone, in great perplexity,
          indulging the deepest grief. Lord Mount Severn had
          intimated to her, kindly and affectionately, that
          henceforth she must find her home with him and his
          wife. Isabel returned a faint thank you, and as soon
          as he left her, burst into a paroxysm of rebellious
          tears. "Have her home with Mrs. Vane!" she uttered
          to her own heart. "No, never: rather would she die,
          rather would she work for her living, rather would
          she eat a crust and drink water!" And so on, and so
          on. Young demoiselles are somewhat prone to indulge
          in these flights of fancy: but they are in most
          cases impracticable and foolish, exceedingly so were
          they in that of Lady Isabel Vane. Work for their
          living! It may appear very feasible in theory; but
          theory and practice are as opposite as light and
          dark. The plain fact was, that Isabel had no
          alternative whatever: she must accept a home with
          Lady Mount Severn: and the conviction, that it must
          be so, stole over her spirit, even while her hasty
          lips were protesting that she would not. Lord Mount
          Severn wished to despatch her to Castle Marling at
          once, but this she successfully resisted, and it was
          decided <pb n="155"/> that she should travel the day
          subsequent to the funeral.</p>
  <p>Mr. Warburton, authorised by the earl, relieved the
          death-chamber of its two intruders: though—very much
          to the surprise of the household—the obnoxious men
          still remained in the house. Mr. Warburton no doubt
          had his reasons; he was a cautious practitioner: and
          the men continued, ostensibly; in charge, until the
          earl was buried. Some said that if the lawyer
          released them, another arrest might be expected.</p>
  <p>On Friday morning the interment took place—in St. Jude's
          churchyard, at West Lynne. Isabel's heart again
          rebelled bitterly: she thought it would have been at
          Mount Severn. The earl remarked, but not in her
          hearing, that he should have too much expense upon
          him, to go to unnecessary outlay over the funeral.
          Certainly he performed honourably all that could be
          required from him. He paid all tradesmen's debts,
          and those owing to the servants, gave them each a
          month's wages and a month's board wages, in lieu of
          the customary warning of dismissal, and paid for
          their mourning. Pound, the butler, he retained in
          his own service. With regard to Isabel's mourning,
          he had desired her to have everything suited to her
          degree. The carriages and horses, on which a
          detainer had been placed, he bought in for his own
          use: they were in excellent condition.</p>
  <p>Two mourners only attended the funeral, the earl and Mr.
          Carlyle: the latter was no relative of the deceased,
          and but a recent friend: but the earl had invited
          him, probably not liking to parade alone his
          trappings of woe. Some of the county aristocracy
          were pall-bearers, and many private carriages
          followed.</p>
  <pb n="156"/>
  <p>All was bustle on the following morning. The earl was to
          depart, and Isabel was to depart; but not together.
          In the course of the day, the domestics would
          disperse. The earl was speeding to London, and the
          chaise, to convey him to the railway station at West
          Lynne, was already at the door, when Mr. Carlyle
          arrived.</p>
  <p>"I was beginning to fear you would not be here, I have
          barely five minutes to spare," observed the earl, as
          he shook hands. "You are sure you fully understood
          about the tombstone?"</p>
  <p>"Perfectly," replied Mr. Carlyle. "How is Lady
          Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"Very down-hearted, I fear, poor child, for she did not
          breakfast with me," returned the earl. "Mason told
          me that she was in a convulsion of grief. A bad man,
          a <hi>bad</hi> man was Mount Severn," he
          emphatically added, as he rose and rang the
          bell.</p>
  <p>"Let Lady Isabel be informed that I am ready to depart,
          and that I wait to see her," he said to the servant
          who answered it. "And while she is coming, Mr.
          Carlyle," he added, "allow me to express my
          obligations to you. How I should have got through
          this worrying business without you, I cannot divine.
          You have promised, mind, to pay me a visit, and I
          shall expect it speedily."</p>
  <p>"Promised conditionally—that I find myself in your
          neighbourhood," smiled Mr. Carlyle. "Should—"</p>
  <p>Isabel entered, dressed also, and ready, for she was to
          depart immediately after the earl. Her crape veil
          was over her face, but she threw it back.</p>
  <p>"My time is up, Isabel, and I must go. Is there anything
          you wish to say to me?"</p>
  <pb n="157"/>
  <p>She opened her lips to speak, but glanced at Mr. Carlyle,
          and hesitated. He was standing at the window, with
          his back towards them.</p>
  <p>"I suppose not," said the earl, answering himself, for he
          was in a hurry to be off, like many others are when
          starting on a journey. "You will have no trouble
          whatever, my dear; Pound will see to everything,
          only mind you get some refreshment in the middle of
          the day, for you won't be at Castle Marling before
          dinner-time. Tell Mrs. Va—tell Lady Mount Severn
          that I had no time to write, but will do so from
          town."</p>
  <p>But Isabel stood before him in an attitude of uncertainty
          —of expectancy, it may be said, her colour
          varying.</p>
  <p>"What is it? You wish to say something."</p>
  <p>She certainly did wish to say something, but she did not
          know how. It was a moment of embarrassment to her,
          intensely painful; and the presence of Mr. Carlyle
          did not tend to lessen it. The latter had no idea
          his absence was wished for.</p>
  <p>"I—I—do not like to ask you, but I—have—no money," she
          stammered, her delicate features flushing
          crimson.</p>
  <p>"Bless me, Isabel! I declare I forgot all about it,"
          cried the earl, in a tone of vexation. "Not being
          accustomed to—this aspect of affairs is so new—" He
          broke off his disjointed sentences, and unbuttoned
          his coat, drew out his purse, and paused over its
          contents.</p>
  <p>"Isabel, I have run myself very short, and have but
          little beyond what will take me to town. You must
          make three pounds do for the present my dear. Pound
          has the funds for the journey. Once at Castle <pb n="158"/> Marling, Lady Mount Severn will supply
          you: but you must tell her, or she will not
          know."</p>
  <p>He shot some gold out of his purse as he spoke, and left
          two sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns on the
          table. "Farewell, my dear; make yourself happy at
          Castle Marling; I shall be home soon."</p>
  <p>Passing from the room with Mr. Carlyle, he stood talking
          with that gentleman a minute, his foot on the step
          of the chaise; and, the next, was being whirled
          away. Mr. Carlyle returned to the breakfast-room,
          where Isabel, an ashy whiteness having replaced the
          crimson on her cheeks, was picking up the gold.</p>
  <p>"Will you do me a favour, Mr. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"I will do anything I can for you."</p>
  <p>She pushed a sovereign and a half towards him. "It is for
          Mr. Kane. I told Marvel to send and pay him, but it
          seems she forgot it, or put it off, and he is not
          paid. The tickets were a sovereign: the rest is for
          tuning the piano. Will you kindly give it to him? If
          I trust one of the servants, it may be forgotten
          again in the hurry of their departure."</p>
  <p>"Kane's charge for tuning a piano is five shillings,"
          remarked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"But he was a long time occupied with it, and he did
          something to the leathers. It is not too much:
          besides, I never ordered him anything to eat. He
          wants money even worse than I do," she added, with a
          poor attempt at a smile. "But for thinking of him, I
          should not have mustered the courage to beg of Lord
          Mount Severn—as you have just heard me do. In that
          case, do you know what I should have done?"</p>
  <p>"What should you have done?" he smiled.</p>
  <p>"I should have asked you to pay him for me, and <pb n="159"/> I would have repaid you as soon as I had
          any money. I had a great mind to ask you, do you
          know; it would have seemed less painful than the
          being obliged to beg of Lord Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"I hope it would," he answered, in a low, earnest tone.
          "What else can I do for you?"</p>
  <p>She was about to answer "Nothing; that he had done
          enough:" but at that moment their attention was
          attracted by a bustle outside, and they moved to the
          window.</p>
  <p>It was the carriage coming round for Lady Isabel. The
          late earl's chariot, which was to convey her to the
          railway station six or seven miles off. It had four
          post-horses to it, the number having been designated
          by Lord Mount Severn, who appeared to wish Isabel to
          leave the neighbourhood in as much state as she had
          entered it. The carriage was packed, and Marvel was
          perched outside.</p>
  <p>"All is ready," she said, "and the time is come for me to
          go. Mr. Carlyle, I am going to leave you a
          legacy—those pretty gold and silver fish, that I
          bought a few weeks back."</p>
  <p>"But why do you not take them?"</p>
  <p>"Take them to Lady Mount Severn's! No, I would rather
          leave them with you. Throw a few crumbs into the
          globe now and then."</p>
  <p>Her face was wet with tears, and he knew she was talking
          hurriedly to cover her emotion.</p>
  <p>"Sit down a few minutes," he said.</p>
  <p>"No—no. I had better go at once."</p>
  <p>He took her hand to conduct her to the carriage. The
          servants were gathered in the hall, waiting for her;
          some had grown grey in her father's service. She <pb n="160"/> put out her hand, she strove to say a
          word of thanks and of farewell, and she thought she
          should choke at the effort of keeping down the sobs.
          At length it was over; a kind look around, a
          yearning wave of the hand, and she passed on with
          Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Pound had ascended to his place by Marvel, and the
          post-boys were waiting the signal to start, but Mr.
          Carlyle had the carriage-door open again, and was
          bending in, holding her hand.</p>
  <p>"I have not said a word of thanks to you for all your
          kindness, Mr. Carlyle," she cried, her breath very
          laboured. "I am sure you have seen that I could
          not."</p>
  <p>"I wish I could have done more; I wish I could have
          shielded you from the annoyances you have been
          obliged to endure!" he answered. "Should we never
          meet again—"</p>
  <p>"Oh, but we shall meet again," she interrupted. "You
          promised Lord Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"True: we may so meet; casually; once in a way: but our
          ordinary paths in life lie far and wide apart. God
          for ever bless you, dear Lady Isabel!"</p>
  <p>The post-boys touched their horses, and the carriage sped
          on. She drew down the blinds, and leaned back in an
          agony of tears: tears for the home she was leaving,
          for the father she had lost. Her last thoughts had
          been of gratitude to Mr. Carlyle; but she had more
          cause to be grateful to him than she yet knew of.
          Emotion soon spends itself, and as her eyes cleared,
          she saw a bit of crumpled paper lying on her lap,
          which appeared to-have fallen from her hand.
          Mechanically she took it up and opened it: it was a
          bank-note for one hundred pounds.</p>
  <pb n="161"/>
  <p>Ah! reader, you will say this is a romance of fiction,
          and a far-fetched one, but it is verily and indeed
          true. Mr. Carlyle had taken it with him to East
          Lynne, that morning, with its destined purpose.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel strained her eyes and gazed at the note:
          gazed, and gazed again. Where could it come from?
          What brought it there? Suddenly the undoubted truth
          flashed upon her: Mr. Carlyle had left it in her
          hand.</p>
  <p>Her cheeks burnt, her fingers trembled, her angry spirit
          was up in arms. In that first moment of discovery,
          she was ready to resent it as an insult; but when
          she came to remember the sober facts of the last few
          days, her anger subsided into admiration of his
          wondrous kindness. Did he not know that she was
          without a home to call her own, without money—
          absolutely without money, save what would be given
          her in charity?</p>
  <p>Well now, what should she do? Of course she could not use
          the note, that was out of the question; and to
          re-enclose it to him would pain him; she felt that a
          nature, capable of generosity so delicate, would be
          deeply wounded at having its generosity thrown back
          upon itself. Should she so pain him? Did he deserve
          it at her hands? No. She would keep the note until
          she had an opportunity of personally returning it to
          him.</p>
  <p>Leaning over the entrance-gate of their house, between
          the grove of dark trees, was Barbara Hare. She had
          heard the hour of Lady Isabel's departure named;
          and, woman-like, <hi>rival</hi> -like—for in that
          light had Barbara's fanciful and jealous heart grown
          to regard Lady Isabel —posted herself there, to
          watch for it. Little saw she. <pb n="162"/> Nothing
          but the carriage, the horses, and the attendants;
          for the blinds were down.</p>
  <p>She stood there long, long after the carriage had passed;
          and presently her father came up from the direction
          of West Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, have you seen Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"No, papa."</p>
  <p>"I have been to his office, but they thought he had gone
          up to East Lynne. Perhaps he will be coming by. I
          want to catch him if I can."</p>
  <p>Mr. Hare stood outside, and rested his elbow on the gate:
          Barbara stood inside. It is probable the one was
          quite as anxious as the other to meet Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"What do you think the report is?" suddenly exclaimed the
          justice. "The place is full of it. That
          Carlyle—"</p>
  <p>Justice Hare took a step into the road, to obtain a
          better view of the way from East Lynne. Barbara's
          face flushed, in the suspense created by his
          unfinished words.</p>
  <p>"That Mr. Carlyle, what, papa?" she asked, as he stepped
          back again.</p>
  <p>"It is Carlyle coming," observed the justice; "I thought
          they were his long legs. That he has bought East
          Lynne, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa! Can it be true? Mr. Carlyle bought East
          Lynne!"</p>
  <p>"As likely as not. He and Miss Corny have got a pretty
          nest of golden eggs laid by, between them. I put the
          question to Dill just now; but he was as close as he
          always is, and said neither one way nor the other.
          Good morning!" called out the justice, as Mr.
          Carlyle approached. "We are impatient on the bench
          to know <pb n="163"/> if you have news from the
          Ipsley Union, because our Union vows the paupers
          shan't stop over to-day."</p>
  <p>"Yes," answered Mr. Carlyle; "they admit the claim, so
          you may despatch them at once. How are you,
          Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"That's all right, then," returned Mr. Hare. "Carlyle,
          people are saying that you have purchased East
          Lynne."</p>
  <p>"Are they? Well, they are not far wrong. East Lynne is
          mine, I believe."</p>
  <p>"Let you lawyers alone for speed, when you have
          yourselves for clients. Here is the earl, dead
          scarcely a week, and East Lynne already transferred
          to you."</p>
  <p>"Not so, justice. East Lynne was mine, months before the
          earl died."</p>
  <p>"What, when he was stopping there? To think of that! A
          pretty rent you charged him, I'll be bound."</p>
  <p>"No rent at all," responded Mr. Carlyle, with a smile.
          "He was an honorary tenant for the time being."</p>
  <p>"Then you were a great fool," observed the justice. "Beg
          pardon, Carlyle—you are a young man, and I am an old
          one; or soon shall be. The earl was another fool to
          get himself so awfully embarrassed."</p>
  <p>"Sadly embarrassed," chimed in Barbara. "I heard, last
          night, that there was nothing left for Lady Isabel;
          that she had actually no money to pay for her
          mourning. The Smiths told the Herberts, and the
          Herberts told me. Do you fancy it is true,
          Archibald?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle appeared much amused. "I wonder they did not
          say Lady Isabel had no mourning, as well as no <pb n="164"/> money: it would have been but a little
          stretch further. What would East Lynne do without
          its marvels?"</p>
  <p>"Ah, what indeed?" cried Justice Hare. "I met her
          carriage, spanking along with four horses, her maid
          and man outside. A young lady, travelling in that
          state, would not be at a loss for mourning money,
          Miss Barbara."</p>
  <p>"People must gossip, you know, sir," said Mr. Carlyle.
          "My East Lynne purchase will be magnified into the
          purchase of West Lynne also, before the day is over.
          Good morning; good morning, Barbara."</p>
  <p>When Lord Mount Severn reached London, and the hotel
          which the Vanes were in the habit of using, the
          first object his eyes lighted on was his own wife,
          whom he had believed to be safe at Castle Marling.
          He inquired the cause.</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn gave herself little trouble to explain.
          She had been up a day or two—could order her
          mourning so much better in person—and William did
          not seem well, so she brought him up for a
          change.</p>
  <p>"I am sorry you came to town, Emma," remarked the earl,
          after listening. "Isabel is gone to-day to Castle
          Marling."</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn quickly lifted her head. "What's she
          gone there for?"</p>
  <p>"It is the most disgraceful piece of business
          altogether," returned the earl, without replying to
          the immediate question. "Mount Severn has died worse
          than a beggar, and there's not a shilling for
          Isabel."</p>
  <p>"It was not expected there would be much."</p>
  <p>"But there's nothing; not a penny; nothing for her own
          personal expenses. I gave her a pound or two today,
          for she was completely without."</p>
  <pb n="165"/>
  <p>The countess opened her eyes. "Where will she live? What
          will become of her?"</p>
  <p>"She must live with us. She—"</p>
  <p>"With us!" interrupted Lady Mount Severn, her voice
          almost reaching a scream. "That she never
          shall."</p>
  <p>"She must, Emma. There is nowhere else for her to live. I
          have been obliged to decide it so; and she is gone,
          as I tell you, to Castle Marling to-day."</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn grew pale with anger. She rose from her
          seat, and confronted her husband, the table being
          between them. "Listen, Raymond: I <hi>will not</hi>
          have Isabel Vane under my roof. I hate her. How
          could you be cajoled into sanctioning such a
          thing?"</p>
  <p>"I was not cajoled, and my sanction was not asked," he
          coldly replied: "I proposed it. Where else is she to
          be?"</p>
  <p>"I don't care where," was the obstinate retort. "Never
          with us."</p>
  <p>"Consider the thing dispassionately," returned his
          lordship. "She has no other relatives, no claim on
          any one. I, the succeeding peer (who might not have
          come into the estates for twenty years hence, had
          Mount Severn's been a good life), am bound in
          courtesy, in good feeling, to afford her a home. Do
          you not see it?"</p>
  <p>"No, I do not," returned the countess. "And I will not
          have her."</p>
  <p>"She is at Castle Marling now, gone to it as her home,"
          resumed the earl; "and even you, when you return,
          will scarcely venture to turn her out again, into
          the road, or send her to the workhouse, or solicit
          her Majesty's ministers for a grant for her from the
          pension <pb n="166"/> fund, and draw down upon
          yourself the censure of the world. I think you might
          show better feeling, Emma."</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn did not retort openly. She possessed
          her share of common sense, and the argument of the
          earl was certainly difficult to answer—"Where was
          Isabel to go, if not to them?" But she muttered
          angry words, and her face looked ready to spit
          fire.</p>
  <p>"She will not trouble you long," carelessly remarked the
          earl. "One, so lovely as Isabel, will be sure to
          marry early; and she appears as gentle and
          sweet-tempered a girl as I ever saw, so whence can
          arise your dislike to her, I don't pretend to guess.
          Many a man will be too ready to forget her want of
          fortune for the sake of her face."</p>
  <p>"She shall marry the first who asks her," snapped the
          angry lady. "I'll take care of that."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XII. LIFE AT CASTLE MARLING.</head>
  <p><hi>Isabel</hi> had been in her new home about ten days
          when Lord and Lady Mount Severn arrived at Castle
          Marling. Which was not a castle, you may as well be
          told, but only the name of a town, nearly contiguous
          to which was their residence, a small estate. Lord
          Mount Severn welcomed Isabel: Lady Mount Severn,
          also, after a fashion; but her manner was so
          repellant, so insolently patronising, that it
          brought the indignant crimson to the cheeks of
          Isabel. And, if this was the case at the first
          meeting, what do you suppose it must have been as
          time went on? Galling slights, petty vexations,
          chilling annoyances were put upon her, trying her
          powers of endurance to the very length of their
          tether: she would wring her hands when alone, and
          passionately wish the she could find another
          refuge.</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn lived but in admiration, and she
          gathered around her those who would offer its
          incense. She carried her flirtations to the very
          verge of propriety; no further: there existed not a
          woman less likely to forget herself, or peril her
          fair fame, than Emma, Countess of Mount Severn; and
          no woman was more scornfully unforgiving to those
          who did forget themselves. She was the very essence
          of envy, of <pb n="168"/> selfishness: she had never
          been known to invite a young and attractive woman to
          her house; she would as soon have invited a leper:
          and now you can understand her wrath, when she heard
          that Isabel Vane was to be her permanent inmate;
          Isabel, with her many charms, her youth, and her
          unusual beauty. At Christmas some visitors were
          down; mostly young men, and they were not wary
          enough to dissemble the fact, that the young beauty
          was a far greater attraction than the exacting
          countess. Then broke forth, beyond bounds, her
          passion, and in a certain private scene, when she
          forgot all but passion, and lost sight of the
          proprieties of life, Isabel was <hi>told</hi> that
          she was a hated intruder, her presence only suffered
          because there was no help for it.</p>
  <p>The earl and countess had two children, both boys, and in
          February, the younger one, always a delicate child,
          died. This somewhat altered their plans. Instead of
          proceeding to London after Easter, as had been
          decided upon, they would not go until May. The earl
          had passed part of the winter at Mount Severn,
          looking after the repairs and renovations that were
          being made there. In March he went to Paris, full of
          grief for the loss of his boy; far greater grief
          than was experienced by Lady Mount Severn.</p>
  <p>April approached; and, with it, Easter. To the
          unconcealed dismay of Lady Mount Severn, her
          grandmother, Mrs. Levison, wrote her word that she
          required change, and should pass Easter with her at
          Castle Marling. Lady Mount Severn would have given
          her diamonds to have got out of it, but there was no
          escape: diamonds that were once Isabel's; at least,
          what Isabel had worn. On the Monday in Passion Week
          the old <pb n="169"/> lady arrived: and, with her,
          Francis Levison. They had no other guests.</p>
  <p>Things went on pretty smoothly till Good Friday, but it
          was a deceitful calm: my lady's jealousy was
          kindling, for Captain Levison's attentions to Isabel
          were driving her wild. At Christmas, his admiration
          had been open enough, but it was more so now. Better
          from any one else could Lady Mount Severn have borne
          this, than from Francis Levison: she had suffered
          the young Guardsman, cousin though he was, to grow
          rather dear; dangerously dear it might have become
          had she been a less cautious woman. More welcome to
          her that all the world, rather than he, had given
          admiration to Isabel. Why did she have him there,
          throwing him into Isabel's companionship, as she had
          done the previous year in London? asks the reader.
          It is more than I can tell: why do people do foolish
          things?</p>
  <p>On Good Friday afternoon, Isabel strolled out with little
          William Vane: Captain Levison joined them, and they
          never came in till nearly dinner-time, when the
          three entered together. Lady Mount Severn doing
          penance all the time, and nursing her rage against
          Isabel, for Mrs. Levison kept her in-doors. There
          was barely time to dress for dinner, and Isabel went
          straight to her room. Her dress was off, her
          dressing-gown on, Marvel was busy with her hair, and
          William chattering at her knee, when the door was
          flung open, and my lady entered.</p>
  <p>"Where have you been?" demanded she, shaking with
          passion. Isabel knew the signs.</p>
  <p>"Strolling about in the shrubberies and grounds,"
          answered Isabel.</p>
  <pb n="170"/>
  <p>"How dare you so disgrace yourself?"</p>
  <p>"I do not understand you," said Isabel, her heart
          beginning to beat unpleasantly. "Marvel, you are
          pulling my hair."</p>
  <p>When women, liable to intemperate fits of passion, give
          the reins to them, they neither know nor care what
          they say. Lady Mount Severn broke into a torrent of
          reproach and abuse, most degrading and
          unjustifiable.</p>
  <p>"Is it not sufficient that you are allowed an asylum in
          my house, but you must also disgrace it? Three hours
          have you been hiding yourself with Francis Levison!
          You have done nothing but flirt with him from the
          moment he came; you did nothing else at
          Christmas."</p>
  <p>The attack was longer and broader, but that was the
          substance of it, and Isabel was goaded to
          resistance, to anger little less great than that of
          the countess. This! —and before her attendant! She,
          an earl's daughter, so much better born than Emma
          Mount Severn, to be thus insultingly accused in the
          other's mad jealousy. Isabel tossed her hair from
          the hands of Marvel, rose up, and confronted the
          countess, constraining her voice to calmness.</p>
  <p>"I do not flirt," she said; "I have never flirted. I
          leave that"—and she could not wholly suppress in
          tone the scorn she felt—"to married women: though it
          seems to me that it is a fault less venial in them,
          than in single ones. There is but one inmate of this
          house who flirts, so far as I have seen since I have
          lived in it: it is you, not I, Lady Mount
          Severn."</p>
  <p>The home truth told on her ladyship. She turned white
          with rage, forgot her manners, and, raising her
          right hand, struck Isabel a stinging blow upon the
          left <pb n="171"/> cheek. Confused and terrified,
          Isabel stood in pain, and before she could speak or
          act, my lady's left hand was raised to the other
          cheek, and a blow left on that. Lady Isabel shivered
          as with a sudden chill, and cried out, a sharp,
          quick cry; covered her outraged face and sank down
          upon the dressing-chair. Marvel threw up her hands
          in dismay, and William Vane could not have burst
          into a louder roar had he been beaten himself. The
          boy was of a sensitive nature—and he was
          frightened.</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn finished up the scene by boxing William
          for his noise, jerked him out of the room, and told
          him he was a monkey.</p>
  <p>Isabel Vane lay through the livelong night, weeping tears
          of anguish and indignation. She could not remain at
          Castle Marling: who would, after so great an
          outrage?—Yet, where was she to go? Fifty times in
          the course of the night, did she wish that she was
          laid beside her father; for her feelings obtained
          the mastery of her reason: in her calm moments she
          would have shrunk from the idea of death, as the
          young and healthy must do. Various schemes crossed
          her brain: that she would take flight to France, and
          lay her case before Mount Severn; that she would beg
          an asylum with old Mrs. Levison; that she would find
          out Mason, and live with her. Daylight rejected them
          all. She had not flirted with Captain Levison, but
          she had received his attention, and suffered his
          admiration: a woman never flirts where she loves;
          and it had come to love, or something very near it,
          in Isabel's heart.</p>
  <p>She rose on the Saturday morning, weak and languid, the
          effects of the night of grief, and Marvel brought
          her breakfast up. William Vane stole into <pb n="172"/> her room afterwards: he was attached to
          her in a remarkable degree.</p>
  <p>"Mamma's going out," he exclaimed in the course of the
          morning. "Look, Isabel."</p>
  <p>Isabel went to the window. Lady Mount Severn was in the
          pony carriage, Francis Levison driving.</p>
  <p>"We can go down now, Isabel. Nobody will be there."</p>
  <p>She assented, and went down with William. But scarcely
          were they in the drawing-room when a servant entered
          with a card on a salver.</p>
  <p>"A gentleman, my lady, wishes to see you."</p>
  <p>"To see me?" returned Isabel, in surprise. "Or Lady Mount
          Severn?"</p>
  <p>"He asked for you, my lady."</p>
  <p>She took up the card. "Mr. Carlyle." "Oh!" she uttered,
          in a tone of joyful surprise, "show him in."</p>
  <p>It is curious, nay, appalling, to trace the thread in a
          human life; how the most trivial occurrences lead to
          the great events of existence, bringing forth
          happiness or misery, weal or woe. A client of Mr.
          Carlyle's, travelling from one part of England to
          the other, was arrested by illness at Castle
          Marling: grave illness it appeared to be, inducing
          fears of death. He had not as the phrase goes,
          settled his affairs, and Mr. Carlyle was telegraphed
          for in haste, to make his will, and for other
          private matters. This journey appeared to Mr.
          Carlyle a very simple occurrence, and yet it was
          destined to lead to events that would end only with
          his own life.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle entered, unaffected and gentlemanly as ever,
          with his noble form, his attractive face, and his
          drooping eyelids. She advanced to meet him, holding
            <pb n="173"/> out her hand, her countenance
          betraying her pleasure. "This is indeed unexpected,"
          she exclaimed. "How very glad I am to see you."</p>
  <p>"Business brought me yesterday to Castle Marling. I could
          not leave it again without calling on you. I hear
          that Lord Mount Severn is absent."</p>
  <p>"He is in France," she rejoined. "I said we should be
          sure to meet again: do you remember, Mr. Carlyle?
          You—"</p>
  <p>Isabel suddenly stopped, for with the word "remember,"
          she also remembered something—the hundred-pound
          note; and what she was saying faltered on her
          tongue. She grew confused indeed, for alas! she had
          changed and partly spent it. <hi>How</hi> was it
          possible to ask Lady Mount Severn for money? and the
          earl was nearly always away. Mr. Carlyle saw her
          embarrassment: though he did not detect its
          cause.</p>
  <p>"What a fine boy!" exclaimed he, looking at the
          child.</p>
  <p>"It is Lord Vane," said Isabel.</p>
  <p>"A truthful, earnest spirit, I am sure," he continued,
          gazing at his open countenance. "How old are you, my
          little man?"</p>
  <p>"I am six, sir; and my brother was four."</p>
  <p>Isabel bent over the child; an excuse to cover her
          embarrassment. "You do not know this gentleman,
          William. It is Mr. Carlyle, and he has been very
          kind to me."</p>
  <p>The little lord turned his thoughtful eyes on Mr.
          Carlyle, apparently studying his countenance. "I
          shall like you, sir, if you are kind to Isabel. Are
          you kind to her?</p>
  <p>"Very, very kind," murmured Isabel, leaving William <pb n="174"/> and turning to Mr. Carlyle, but not
          looking at him. "I don't know what to say; I ought
          to thank you: I did not intend to use the—to use
          it—but I— I—"</p>
  <p>"Hush!" he interrupted, laughing at her confusion; "I do
          not know what you are talking of. I have a great
          misfortune to break to you, Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>She lifted her eyes and her glowing cheeks, somewhat
          aroused from her own thoughts.</p>
  <p>"Two of your fish are dead. The gold ones."</p>
  <p>"Are they?"</p>
  <p>"I believe it was the frost killed them: I don't know
          what else it could have been. You may remember those
          bitter days we had in January: they died then."</p>
  <p>"You are very good to take care of them, all this while.
          How is East Lynne looking? Dear East Lynne! Is it
          occupied?"</p>
  <p>"Not yet. I have spent some money upon it, and it repays
          the outlay."</p>
  <p>The excitement of his arrival had worn off, and she was
          looking herself again, pale and sad: he could not
          help observing that she was changed.</p>
  <p>"I cannot expect to look so well at Castle Marling as I
          did at East Lynne," she answered.</p>
  <p>"I trust it is a happy home to you?" said Mr. Carlyle,
          speaking upon impulse.</p>
  <p>She glanced up at him, a look that he would never forget:
          it certainly told of despair. "No," she said,
          shaking her head, "it is a miserable home, and I
          cannot remain in it. I have been awake all night,
          thinking where I can go, but I cannot tell. I have
          not a friend in the wide world."</p>
  <p>Never let people talk secrets before children, for be <pb n="175"/> assured that they comprehend a vast deal
          more than is expedient: the saying that "Little
          pitchers have great ears" is wonderfully true. Lord
          Vane held up his head to Mr. Carlyle:</p>
  <p>"Isabel told me this morning that she should go away from
          us. Shall I tell you why? Mamma beat her yesterday
          when she was angry."</p>
  <p>"Be quiet, William!" interrupted Lady Isabel, her face in
          a flame.</p>
  <p>"Two great slaps upon her cheeks," continued the young
          viscount; "and Isabel cried so, and I screamed, and
          then mamma hit me. But boys are made to be hit;
          nurse says they are. Marvel came into the nursery
          when we were at tea, and told nurse about it. She
          says Isabel's too good-looking, and that's why
          mamma—"</p>
  <p>Isabel stopped the child's tongue, rang a peal on the
          bell, and marshalled him to the door; despatching
          him to the nursery by the servant who answered
          it.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle's eyes were full of indignant sympathy. "Can
          this be true?" he asked, in a low tone, when she
          returned to him. "You do, indeed, want a
          friend."</p>
  <p>"I must bear my lot," she replied, obeying the impulse
          which prompted her to confide in Mr. Carlyle. "At
          least till Lord Mount Severn returns."</p>
  <p>"And then?"</p>
  <p>"I really do not know," she said, the rebellious tears
          rising faster than she could choke them down. "He
          has no other home to offer me; but with Lady Mount
          Severn I cannot and will not remain. She would break
          my heart, as she has already well-nigh broken my
          spirit. I have not deserved it of her, Mr.
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"No, I am sure you have not," he warmly answered. "I wish
          I could help you! What can I do?"</p>
  <pb n="176"/>
  <p>"You can do nothing," she said. "What can any one
          do?"</p>
  <p>"I wish, I wish I could help you!" he repeated. "East
          Lynne was not, take it for all in all, a pleasant
          home to you, but it seems you changed for the worse
          when you left it."</p>
  <p>"Not a pleasant home!" she echoed, its reminiscences
          appearing delightful in that moment, for it must be
          remembered that all things are estimated by
          comparison. "Indeed it was; I may never have so
          pleasant a one again. Oh, Mr. Carlyle, do not
          disparage East Lynne to me! Would I could awake, and
          find the last few months but a hideous dream!—that I
          could find my dear father alive again!—that we were
          still living peacefully at East Lynne! It would be a
          very Eden to me now."</p>
  <p>What was Mr. Carlyle about to say? What emotion was it
          that agitated his countenance, impeded his breath,
          and dyed his face blood-red? His better genius was
          surely not watching over him, or those words had
          never been spoken.</p>
  <p>"There is but one way," he began, taking her hand and
          nervously playing with it, probably unconscious that
          he did so; "only one way in which you could return
          to East Lynne. And that way—I may not presume,
          perhaps, to point it out."</p>
  <p>She looked at him, and waited for an explanation.</p>
  <p>"If my words offend you, Lady Isabel, check them, as
          their presumption deserves, and pardon me. May I
          —dare I—offer you to return to East Lynne as its
          mistress?"</p>
  <p>She did not comprehend him in the slightest degree; the
          drift of his meaning never dawned upon her. <pb n="177"/> "Return to East Lynne as its mistress?"
          she repeated, in bewilderment.</p>
  <p>"And as my wife."</p>
  <p>No possibility of misunderstanding him now, and the shock
          and surprise were great. She had stood there by Mr.
          Carlyle's side, conversing confidentially with him,
          esteeming him greatly, feeling as if he were her
          truest friend on earth, clinging to him in her heart
          as to a powerful haven of refuge, loving him almost
          as she would love a brother, suffering her hand to
          remain in his. <hi>But, to be his wife!</hi> —the
          idea had never presented itself to her in any shape
          until this moment, and her first emotion was one of
          entire opposition, her first movement to express it,
          as she essayed to withdraw herself and her hand away
          from him.</p>
  <p>But Mr. Carlyle did not suffer it. He not only retained
          that hand, but took the other also, and spoke, now
          the ice was broken, eloquent words of love. Not
          unmeaning phrases of rhapsody, about hearts and
          darts and dying for her, like somebody else might
          have spoken, but earnest-hearted words of deep
          tenderness, calculated to win upon the mind's good
          sense, as well as upon the ear and heart: and, it
          may be, that had her imagination not been filled up
          with that "somebody else," she would have said Yes
          there and then.</p>
  <p>They were suddenly interrupted. Lady Mount Severn
          entered, and took in the scene at a glance: Mr.
          Carlyle's bent attitude of devotion, his
          imprisonment of the hands, and Isabel's perplexed
          and blushing countenance. She threw up her head and
          her little inquisitive nose, and stopped short on
          the carpet; her freezing looks demanding an
          explanation, as plainly as looks can do it. Mr.
          Carlyle turned to her, and, by way of <pb n="178"/>
          sparing Isabel, proceeded to introduce himself.
          Isabel had just presence of mind left to name her:
          "Lady Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"I am sorry that Lord Mount Severn should be absent, to
          whom I have the honour of being known," he said. "I
          am Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"I have heard of you," replied her ladyship, scanning his
          good looks, and feeling cross that his homage should
          be given where she saw it was given, "but I had
            <hi>not</hi> heard that you and Lady Isabel Vane
          were on the extraordinary terms of intimacy
          that—that—"</p>
  <p>"Madam," he interrupted, as he handed a chair to her
          ladyship and took another himself, "we have never
          yet been on terms of extraordinary intimacy. I was
          begging the Lady Isabel to grant that we might be: I
          was asking her to become my wife."</p>
  <p>The avowal was as a shower of incense to the countess,
          and her ill-humour melted into sunshine. It was a
          solution to her great difficulty, a loophole by
          which she might get rid of her bête noire, the hated
          Isabel. A flush of gratification lighted her face,
          and she became full of graciousness to Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"How very grateful Isabel must feel to you," quoth she.
          "I speak openly, Mr, Carlyle, because I know that
          you were cognisant of the unprotected state in which
          she was left by the earl's improvidence, putting
          marriage for her; at any rate, a high marriage;
          nearly out of the question. East Lynne is a
          beautiful place, I have heard."</p>
  <p>"For its size: it is not large," replied Mr. Garlyle, as
          he rose: for Isabel had also risen and was coming
          forward.</p>
  <pb n="179"/>
  <p>"And pray what is Lady Isabel's answer?" quickly asked
          the countess, turning to her.</p>
  <p>Not to her did Isabel condescend to give an answer, but
          she approached Mr. Carlyle, and spoke in a low
          tone.</p>
  <p>"Will you give me a few hours for consideration?"</p>
  <p>"I am only too happy that you should accord it
          consideration, for it speaks to me of hope," was his
          reply, as he opened the door for her to pass out. "I
          will be here again this afternoon."</p>
  <p>It was a perplexing debate that Lady Isabel held with
          herself in the solitude of her chamber, whilst Mr.
          Carlyle touched upon ways and means to Lady Mount
          Severn. Isabel was little more than a child, and as
          a child she reasoned, looking neither far nor deep:
          the shallow, palpable aspect of affairs alone
          presenting itself to her view. That Mr. Carlyle was
          not of rank equal to her own, she scarcely
          remembered: East Lynne seemed a very fair settlement
          in life, and in point of size, beauty, and
          importance, it was superior to the home she was now
          in. She forgot that her position at East Lynne as
          Mr. Carlyle's wife, would not be what it had been as
          Lord Mount Severn's daughter; she forgot that she
          would be tied to a quiet home, shut out from the
          great world, from the pomps and vanities to which
          she was born. She liked Mr. Carlyle much, she liked
          to be with him, she experienced pleasure in
          conversing with him; in short, but for that other
          ill-omened fancy which had crept over her, there
          would have been a danger of her falling in love with
          Mr. Carlyle. And oh! to be removed for ever from the
          bitter dependence on Lady Mount Severn—East Lynne
          would, after that, seem what she had called it,
          Eden.</p>
  <pb n="180"/>
  <p>"So far it looks favourable," mentally exclaimed poor
          Isabel, "but there is the other side of the
          question. It is not only that I do not love Mr.
          Carlyle, but I fear I do love, or very nearly love,
          Francis Levison. I wish <hi>he</hi> would ask me to
          be his wife!—or that I had never seen him."</p>
  <p>Isabel's soliloquy was interrupted by the entrance of
          Mrs. Levison and the countess. What the latter had
          said to the old lady to win her to the cause, was
          best known to herself, but she was eloquent in it.
          They both used every possible argument to induce her
          to accept Mr. Carlyle: the old lady declaring that
          he was worth a dozen empty-headed men of the great
          world.</p>
  <p>Isabel listened, now swayed one way, now the other, and
          when the afternoon came, her head was aching with
          perplexity. The stumbling-block that she could not
          get over was Francis Levison. She saw Mr. Carlyle's
          approach from her window, and went down to the
          drawing-room, not in the least knowing what her
          answer was to be, a shadowy idea was presenting
          itself that she would ask him for longer time, and
          write her answer.</p>
  <p>In the drawing-room was Francis Levison, and her heart
          beat wildly: which said beating might have convinced
          her that she ought not to marry another.</p>
  <p>"Where have you been hiding yourself?" cried he. "Did you
          hear of our mishap with the pony carriage?"</p>
  <p>"No," was her answer.</p>
  <p>"I was driving Emma into town. The pony took fright,
          kicked, plunged, and went down upon his knees: she
          took fright in her turn, got out, and walked back. I
          gave the brute some chastisement and a race, and
          brought him to the stables, getting home in time <pb n="181"/> to be introduced to Mr. Carlyle. He
          seems an out-and out good fellow, Isabel, and I
          congratulate you."</p>
  <p>She looked up at him.</p>
  <p>"Don't start. We are all in the family, and my lady told
          me: I won't betray it abroad. She says East Lynne is
          a place to be coveted. I wish you happiness,
          Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Thank you," she returned, in a sarcastic tone, though
          her throat beat and her lips quivered. "You are
          premature in your congratulations, Captain
          Levison."</p>
  <p>"Am I? Keep my good wishes, then, till the right man
          comes. I am beyond the pale myself, and dare not
          think of entering the happy state," he added, in a
          pointed tone. "I have indulged dreams of it, like
          others, but I cannot afford to indulge them
          seriously: a poor man, with uncertain prospects, can
          only play the butterfly, perhaps to his life's
          end."</p>
  <p>He quitted the room as he spoke. It was impossible for
          Isabel to misunderstand him, but a feeling shot
          across her mind, for the first time, that he was
          false and heartless. One of the servants appeared,
          showing in Mr. Carlyle: nothing false or heartless
          about <hi>him</hi> . He closed the door, and
          approached her. She did not speak, and her lips were
          white and trembling. Mr. Carlyle waited.</p>
  <p>"Well?" he said, at length, in a gentle tone. "Have you
          decided to grant my prayer?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. But—" She could not go on. What with one agitation
          and another, she had difficulty in conquering her
          emotion. "But—I was going to tell you—"</p>
  <p>"Presently," he whispered, leading her to a sofa; <pb n="182"/> "we can both afford to wait now. Isabel,
          you have made me very happy!"</p>
  <p>"I ought to tell you, I must tell you," she began again,
          in the midst of hysterical tears. "Though I have
          said yes to your proposal, I do not—yet—It has come
          upon me by surprise," she stammered. "I like you
          very much; I esteem and respect you: but I do not
          yet love you."</p>
  <p>"I should wonder if you did. But you will let me earn
          your love, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Oh yes," she earnestly answered. "I hope so."</p>
  <p>He drew her closer to him, bent his face, and took from
          her lips his first kiss. Isabel was passive; she
          supposed he had gained the right. "My dearest! it is
          all I ask."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stayed over the following day, and before he
          departed in the evening, arrangements had been
          discussed. The marriage was to take place
          immediately: all concerned had a motive for hurrying
          it on. Mr. Carlyle was anxious that the fair flower
          should be his; Isabel was sick of Castle Marling,
          sick of some of the people in it; my lady was sick
          of Isabel. In less than a month it was to be, and
          Francis Levison sneered over the "indecent haste."
          Mr. Carlyle wrote to the earl. Lady Mount Severn
          announced that she should present Isabel with the
          trousseau, and wrote to London to order it. It is a
          positive fact that when he was taking leave of
          Isabel she clung to him.</p>
  <p>"I wish I could take you now, my darling!" he uttered. "I
          cannot bear to leave you here."</p>
  <p>"I wish you could!" she sighed. "You have seen only the
          sunny side of Lady Mount Severn."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIII. MR. DILL'S SHAKING.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> sensations of Mr. Carlyle when he returned
          to West Lynne were very much like those of an Eton
          boy, who knows he has been in mischief, and dreads
          detection. Always open as to his own affairs, for he
          had nothing to conceal, he yet deemed it expedient
          to disemble now. He felt that his sister would be
          bitter at the prospect of his marrying; instinct had
          taught him that, years past; and he believed that,
          of all women, the most objectionable to her, would
          be Lady Isabel, for Miss Carlyle looked to the
          useful, and had neither sympathy nor admiration for
          the beautiful. He was not sure but she might be
          capable of endeavouring to frustrate the marriage,
          should news of it reach her ears, and her
          indomitable will had carried many strange things in
          her life: therefore you will not blame Mr. Carlyle
          for observing entire reticence as to his future
          plans.</p>
  <p>A family of the name of Carew had been about taking East
          Lynne: they wished to rent it, furnished, for three
          years. Upon some of the minor arrangements they and
          Mr. Carlyle were opposed, but the latter declined to
          give way. During his absence at Castle Marling, news
          had arrived from them—that they acceded <pb n="184"/> to all his terms, and would enter upon East Lynne
          as soon as was convenient. Miss Carlyle was full of
          congratulation; it was off their hands, she said:
          but the first letter Mr. Carlyle wrote was—to
          decline them. He did not tell this to Miss Carlyle.
          The final touches of the house were given,
          preparatory to the reception of its inhabitants,
          three maid and two men-servants hired and sent
          there, upon board wages, until the family should
          arrive.</p>
  <p>One evening, three weeks subsequent to Mr. Carlyle's
          visit to Castle Marling, Barbara Hare called at Miss
          Carlyle's, and found them going to tea, much earlier
          than usual.</p>
  <p>"We dined earlier," said Miss Corny, "and I ordered tea
          in as soon as the dinner went away. Otherwise
          Archibald would have taken none."</p>
  <p>"I am as well without tea," said he. "I have a mass of
          business to get through yet."</p>
  <p>"You are not so well without it," cried Miss Corny, "and
          I don't choose that you should go without it. Take
          off your bonnet, Barbara. He does things like nobody
          else: he is off to Castle Marling tomorrow, and
          never could open his lips till just now that he was
          going."</p>
  <p>"Is that invalid—Brewster, or whatever his name is—laid
          up at Castle Marling still?" asked Barbara.</p>
  <p>"He is there still," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Barbara sat down to the tea-table, though protesting that
          she ought not to remain, for she had told her mamma
          she should be home to make tea. Miss Carlyle
          interrupted what she was saying, by telling her
          brother she should go presently and pack his
          things.</p>
  <p>"Oh no," returned he, with alarming quickness, "I <pb n="185"/> will pack them myself, thank you. Peter,
          you can put the portmanteau in my room. The large
          one."</p>
  <p>"The large one!" echoed Miss Corny, who never could let
          anything pass without her interference, "why, it's
          as big as a house. What in the world can you want,
          dragging that with you?"</p>
  <p>"I have papers and things to take, besides clothes."</p>
  <p>"I am sure I could pack all your things in the small
          one," persisted Miss Corny. "I'll try. You only tell
          me what you want put in. Take the small portmanteau
          to your master's room, Peter."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced at Peter, and Peter glanced back
          again with an imperceptible nod. "I prefer to pack
          my things myself, Cornelia. What have you done
          now?"</p>
  <p>"A stupid trick," she answered—for, in fidgeting with a
          knife, Miss Corny had cut her finger. "Have you any
          sticking-plaster, Archibald?"</p>
  <p>He opened his pocket-book, and laid it on the table while
          he took from it some black plaster. Miss Carlyle's
          inquisitive eyes caught sight of a letter lying
          there; <hi>sans cérémonie</hi> , she stretched out
          her hand, caught it up, and opened it.</p>
  <p>"Who is this from? It is a lady's writing."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laid his hand flat upon it, as if to hide it
          from her view. "Excuse me, Cornelia; that is a
          private letter."</p>
  <p>"Private nonsense!" retorted Miss Corny. "I am sure you
          get no letters that I may not read. It bears
          yesterday's postmark."</p>
  <p>"Oblige me with the letter," he returned; and Miss
          Carlyle, in her astonishment at the calmly
          authoritative tone, yielded it to him.</p>
  <pb n="186"/>
  <p>"Archibald, what is the matter with you?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing," answered he, shutting the letter in the
          pocket-book, and returning it to his pocket, leaving
          out the sticking-plaster for Miss Corny's benefit.
          "It's not fair to look into a man's private letters,
          is it, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>He laughed good humouredly as he looked at Barbara. But
          she had seen with surprise that a deep flush of
          emotion had risen to his face—he, so calm a man!
          Miss Carlyle was not one to be put down easily, and
          she returned to the charge.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, if ever I saw the Vane crest, it is on the
          seal of that letter."</p>
  <p>"Whether the Vane crest is on the letter, or not, the
          contents of it were written for my eye alone," he
          rejoined. And, somehow, Miss Carlyle did not like
          the firm tone. Barbara broke the silence.</p>
  <p>"Shall you call on the Mount Severns this time?"</p>
  <p>"Yes," he answered.</p>
  <p>"Do they talk yet of Lady Isabel's marrying?" pursued
          Barbara. "Did you hear anything of it?"</p>
  <p>"I cannot charge my memory with all I heard or did not
          hear, Barbara. Your tea wants more sugar, does it
          not?"</p>
  <p>"A little," she answered, and Mr. Carlyle drew the
          sugar-basin towards her cup, and dropped four or
          five large lumps in, before anybody could stop
          him.</p>
  <p>"What's that for?" asked Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>He burst out laughing. "I forgot what I was doing.
          Really, Barbara, I beg your tea's pardon. Cornelia
          will give you another cup."</p>
  <p>"But it's a cup of tea and so much good sugar wasted,"
          tartly responded Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>Barbara sprang up the moment tea was over. "I <pb n="187"/> don't know what mamma will say to me. And it is
          beginning to grow dusk! She will think it is late
          for me to be out alone."</p>
  <p>"Archibald can walk with you," said Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I don't know that," cried he, in his plain, open way.
          "Dill is waiting for me in the office, and I have
          some hours' work before me. However—I suppose you
          won't care to put up with Peter's attendance; so
          make haste with your bonnet, Barbara."</p>
  <p>No need to tell Barbara that, when the choice between him
          and Peter depended on the speed she should make. She
          wished good evening to Miss Carlyle, and went out
          with him, he taking her parasol from her hand. It
          was a calm, lovely night, very light yet, and they
          took the field way.</p>
  <p>Barbara could not forget Isabel Vane. She never had
          forgotten her, or the jealous feeling that arose in
          her heart at Mr. Carlyle's constant visits to East
          Lynne when she inhabited it. She returned to the
          subject now.</p>
  <p>"I asked you, Archibald, whether you had heard that Lady
          Isabel was likely to marry."</p>
  <p>"And I answered you, Barbara: that my memory could not
          carry all I may have heard."</p>
  <p>"But did you?" persisted Barbara.</p>
  <p>"You are perserving," he smiled. "I believe Lady Isabel
          is likely to marry."</p>
  <p>Barbara drew a relieved sigh. "To whom?"</p>
  <p>The same amused smile played on his lips. "Do you suppose
          I could put premature questions? I may be able to
          tell you more about it after my next return from
          Castle Marling."</p>
  <p>"Do try and find out," said she. "Perhaps it is to <pb n="188"/> Lord Vane. Who is it says that more
          marriages arise from habitual association than—"</p>
  <p>She stopped, for Mr. Carlyle had turned his eyes upon
          her, and was laughing.</p>
  <p>"You are a clever guesser, Barbara. Lord Vane is a little
          fellow five or six years old.</p>
  <p>"Oh," returned Barbara, considerably discomfited.</p>
  <p>"And the nicest child," he warmly continued: "open
          tempered, generous hearted, earnest spirited. Should
          I have children of my own," he added, switching the
          hedge with the parasol, and speaking in an
          abstracted manner, as if forgetful of his companion,
          "I could wish them to be like William Vane."</p>
  <p>"A very important confession," gaily returned Barbara.
          "After contriving to impress West Lynne with the
          conviction that you would be an old bachelor."</p>
  <p>"I don't know that I ever promised West Lynne anything of
          the sort," cried Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Barbara laughed now. "I suppose West Lynne judges by
          appearances. When a man owns to thirty years—"</p>
  <p>"Which I don't do," interrupted Mr. Carlyle, considerably
          damaging the hedge and the parasol. "I may be an old
          married man before I count thirty: the chances are,
          that I shall be."</p>
  <p>"Then you must have fixed upon your wife," she quickly
          cried.</p>
  <p>"I do not say I have not, Barbara. All in good time to
          proclaim it, though."</p>
  <p>Barbara withdrew her arm from Mr. Carlyle's, under
          pretence of repinning her shawl. Her heart was
          beating, her whole frame trembling, and she feared
          he might <pb n="189"/> detect her emotion. She never
          thought he could allude to any one but herself. Poor
          Barbara!</p>
  <p>"How flushed you look, Barbara!" he exclaimed. "Have I
          walked too fast?"</p>
  <p>She seemed not to hear, intent upon her shawl. Then she
          took his arm again, and they walked on, Mr. Carlyle
          striking the hedge and the grass more industriously
          than ever. Another minute, and—the handle was in
          two.</p>
  <p>"I thought you would do it," said Barbara, while he was
          regarding the parasol with ludicrous dismay. "Never
          mind; it is an old one."</p>
  <p>"I will bring you another to replace it. What is the
          colour? Brown. I won't forget. Hold the relics a
          minute, Barbara."</p>
  <p>He put the pieces in her hand, and taking out a
          note-case, made a note in pencil.</p>
  <p>"What's that for?" she inquired.</p>
  <p>He held it close to her eyes that she might discern what
          he had written; "Brown parasol. B. H." "A reminder
          for me, Barbara, in case I forget."</p>
  <p>Barbara's eye detected another item or two, already
          entered in the note-case. "Piano." "Plate." "I jot
          down the things, as they occur to me, that I must
          get in London," he explained. "Otherwise I should
          forget half."</p>
  <p>"In London! I thought you were going in an opposite
          direction: to Castle Marling."</p>
  <p>It was a slip of the tongue, but Mr. Carlyle repaired it.
          "I may probably have to visit London as well as
          Castle Marling. How bright the moon looks, rising
          there, Barbara!"</p>
  <p>"So bright—that, or the sky—that I saw your <pb n="190"/>
          secrets," answered she. "Piano! Plate! What can you
          want with either, Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"They are for East Lynne," he quietly replied.</p>
  <p>"Oh, for the Carews." And Barbara's interest in the items
          was gone.</p>
  <p>They turned into the road just below the Grove, and
          reached it. Mr. Carlyle held the gate open for
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"You will come in and say good night to mamma. She was
          saying to-day what a stranger you have made of
          yourself lately."</p>
  <p>"I have been busy. And I really have not the time
          to-night. You must remember me to her instead."</p>
  <p>He closed the gate again. But Barbara leaned over it,
          unwilling to let him go.</p>
  <p>"Shall you be away a week?"</p>
  <p>"I dare say I may. Here, take the wreck of the parasol,
          Barbara: I was about to carry it off with me. I can
          buy you a new one without stealing the old one."</p>
  <p>"Archibald, I have long wished to ask you something,"
          said she, in a tone of suppressed agitation, as she
          took the pieces and flung them on the path by the
          thick trees. "You will not deem me foolish?"</p>
  <p>"What is it?"</p>
  <p>"When you gave me the gold chain and locket a year
          ago—you remember?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. Well?"</p>
  <p>"I put some of that hair of Richard's in it, and a bit of
          Anne's, and of mamma's: a tiny little bit of each.
          And there is room for more, you see."</p>
  <p>She held it to him as she spoke, for she always wore it
          round her neck, attached to the chain.</p>
  <pb n="191"/>
  <p>"I cannot see well by this light, Barbara. If there is
          room for more, what of that?"</p>
  <p>"I like to think that I possess a memento of my best
          friends, or of those who were dear to me. I wish you
          to give me a bit of your hair to put with the rest—
          as it was you who gave me the locket."</p>
  <p>"My hair!" returned Mr. Carlyle, in a tone of as much
          astonishment as if she had asked for his head. "What
          good would that do you, Barbara, or the locket
          either?"</p>
  <p>Her face flushed painfully: her heart beat. "I like to
          have a remembrance of the friends I—I care for," she
          stammered. "Nothing more, Archibald."</p>
  <p>He detected neither the emotion nor the depth of feeling,
          the <hi>sort</hi> of feeling that had prompted the
          request, and he met it with good-natured
          ridicule.</p>
  <p>"What a pity you did not tell me yesterday, Barbara! I
          had my hair cut and might have sent you the
          snippings. Don't be a goose, child, and exalt me
          into a Wellington, to bestow hair and autographs. I
          can't stop a minute longer. Good night."</p>
  <p>He hastened away with quick strides, and Barbara covered
          her face with her hands. "What have I done? what
          have I done?" she reiterated aloud. "Is it in his
          nature to be thus indifferent—matter of fact? Has he
          no sentiment? But it will come. Oh, the bliss this
          night has brought forth! there was truth in his tone
          beneath its vein of mockery, when he spoke of his
          chosen wife. I need not go far to guess who it is—he
          has told no one else, and he pays attention to none
          but me. Archibald, when once I am your wife you
          shall know how fondly I love you; you cannot know
          till then."</p>
  <pb n="192"/>
  <p>She lifted her fair young face, beautiful in its
          radiance, and gazed at the deepening moonlight; then
          turned away and pursued her path up the garden-walk,
          unconscious that something, wearing a bonnet, pushed
          its head beyond the trees to steal a look after her.
          Barbara would have said less, had she divined there
          was a third party to the interview.</p>
  <p>It was three mornings after the departure of Mr. Carlyle
          that Mr. Dill appeared before Miss Carlyle, bearing
          a letter. She was busy regarding the effect of some
          new muslin curtains, just put up, and did not pay
          attention to him.</p>
  <p>"Will you please take the letter, Miss Cornelia. The
          postman left it in the office with ours. It is from
          Mr. Archibald."</p>
  <p>"Why, what has he got to write to me about?" retorted
          Miss Corny. "Does he say when he is coming
          home?"</p>
  <p>"You had better see, Miss Cornelia. He does not say
          anything about his return in mine."</p>
  <p>She opened the letter, glanced at it, and sank down on a
          chair: more overcome, more stupified than she had
          felt in her whole life.</p>
  <p>"Castle Marling, May 1st.</p>
  <p>"My dear Cornelia,—I was married this morning to Lady
          Isabel Vane, and hasten briefly to acquaint you with
          the fact. I will write you more fully to-morrow or
          the next day, and explain all things.</p>
  <p>"Ever your affectionate brother,</p>
  <p>" <hi>Archibald Carlyle</hi> ."</p>
  <p>"It is a hoax," were the first guttural sounds that <pb n="193"/> escaped from Miss Carlyle's throat, when
          speech came to her.</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill only stood like a stone image.</p>
  <p>"It is a hoax, I say," raved Miss Carlyle. "What are you
          standing there for, like a gander, on one leg?" she
          reiterated, venting her anger upon the unoffending
          man. " <hi>Is</hi> it a hoax, or not?"</p>
  <p>"I am overdone with amazement, Miss Corny. It is not a
          hoax: I have had a letter too."</p>
  <p>"It can't be true; it <hi>can't</hi> be true. He had no
          more thought of being married when he left here,
          three days ago, than I have."</p>
  <p>"How can we tell that, Miss Corny? How are we to know he
          did not go to be married? I fancy he did."</p>
  <p>"Go to be married!" shrieked Miss Corny, in a passion,
          "he would not be such a fool. And to that fine
          lady-child! No; no."</p>
  <p>"He has sent this to be put in the county journals," said
          Mr. Dill, holding forth a scrap of paper. "They are
          married, sure enough."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle took it and held it before her; her hand was
          cold as ice, and shook as if with palsy.</p>
  <p>"Married.—On the 1st inst., at Castle Marling, by the
          chaplain to the Earl of Mount Severn, Archibald
          Carlyle, Esquire, of East Lynne, to the Lady Isabel
          Mary Vane, only child of William, late Earl of Mount
          Severn."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle tore the paper to atoms and scattered it.
          Mr. Dill afterwards made copies from memory, and
          sent them to the journal offices. But let that
          pass.</p>
  <p>"I will never forgive him," she deliberately uttered,
          "and I will never forgive or tolerate her. The
          senseless <pb n="194"/> idiot! to go and marry Mount
          Severn's expensive daughter! a thing who goes to
          court in feathers and a train—streaming out three
          yards behind her!"</p>
  <p>"He is not an idiot, Miss Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"He is worse; he is a wicked madman," she retorted, in a
          midway state between rage and tears. "He must have
          been stark staring mad to go and do it; and had I
          gathered an inkling of the project I would have
          taken out a commission of lunacy against him. Ay,
          you may stare, old Dill, but I would, as truly as I
          hope to have my sins forgiven. Where are they to
          live?"</p>
  <p>"I expect they will live at East Lynne."</p>
  <p>"What?" screamed Miss Corny. "Live at East Lynne with the
          Carews! You are going mad too, I think."</p>
  <p>"The negociation with the Carews is off, Miss Cornelia.
          When Mr. Archibald returned from Castle Marling at
          Easter, he wrote to decline them. I saw the copy of
          the letter in the copying-book. I expect he had
          settled matters then with Lady Isabel, and had
          decided to keep East Lynne for himself."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle's mouth had opened with consternation.
          Recovering partially, she rose from her seat, and
          drawing herself to her full and majestic height, she
          advanced behind the astounded gentleman, seized the
          collar of his coat with both hands, and shook him
          for several minutes. Poor old Dill, short and
          slight, was as a puppet in her hands, and thought
          his breath had gone for ever.</p>
  <p>"I would have had out a lunacy commission for you also,
          you sly villain! You are in the plot; you have been
          aiding and abetting him: you knew as much of it as
          he did."</p>
  <pb n="195"/>
  <p>"I declare solemnly, to the Goodness that made me, I did
          not," gasped the ill-treated man, when he could
          gather speech. "I am as innocent as a baby, Miss
          Corny. When I got the letter just now in the office,
          you might have knocked me down with a feather."</p>
  <p>"What has he gone and done it for? an expensive girl
          without a shilling! And how dared you be privy to
          the refusing of East Lynne to the Carews? You
            <hi>have</hi> abetted him. But he never can be
          fool enough to think of living there!"</p>
  <p>"I was not privy to it, Miss Corny, before it was done.
          And, had I been—I am only Mr. Archibald's servant.
          Had he not intended to take East Lynne for his
          residence, he would not announce himself as
          Archibald Carlyle, <hi>of East Lynne</hi> . And he
          can well afford it, Miss Corny; you know he can; and
          he only takes up his suitable position in going to
          it," added the faithful clerk, soothingly, "and she
          is a sweet, pretty, lovable creature, though she is
          a noble lady."</p>
  <p>"I hope his folly will come home to him!" was the
          wrathful rejoinder.</p>
  <p>"Heaven forbid!" cried old Dill.</p>
  <p>"Idiot! idiot! WHAT possessed him?" cried the exasperated
          Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>"Well, Miss Corny, I must hasten back to the office,"
          concluded Mr. Dill, by way of terminating the
          conference. "And I am truly vexed, ma'am, that you
          should have fancied there was cause to fall out upon
          me."</p>
  <p>"I shall do it again before the day's over, if you come
          in my way," hotly responded Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>She sat down as soon as she was alone, and her face
          assumed a stony, rigid look, Her hands fell upon her
            <pb n="196"/> knees, and Mr. Carlyle's letter
          dropped to the ground. After a while her features
          began to work, and she nodded her head, and lifted,
          now one hand, now the other, apparently debating
          various points in her own mind. By-and-bye she rose,
          attired herself in her bonnet and shawl, and took
          the way to Justice Hare's. She felt that the news
          which would be poured out to West Lynne before the
          day was over, did reflect a slight upon herself: her
          much-loved brother had forsaken her, to take to
          himself one, nearer and dearer, and had done it in
          dissimulation: therefore she herself would be the
          first to proclaim it, far and wide.</p>
  <p>Barbara was at the window in the usual sitting-room, as
          Miss Corny entered the Grove. A grim smile, in spite
          of her outraged feelings, crossed that lady's lips,
          when she thought of the blow about to be dealt out
          to Barbara. Very clearly had she penetrated to the
          love of that young lady for Archibald; to her hopes
          of becoming his wife.</p>
  <p>"What brings Cornelia here?" thought Barbara, who was
          looking very pretty in her summer attire, for the
          weather was unusually warm, and she had assumed it.
          "How are you?" she said, leaning from the window.
          "Would you believe it? the warm day has actually
          tempted mamma forth; papa is driving her to
          Lynneborough. Come in; the hall door is open."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle came in, without answering; and seating
          herself upon a chair, emitted a few dismal groans,
          by way of preliminary.</p>
  <p>Barbara turned to her quickly. "Are you ill? Has anything
          upset you?"</p>
  <p>"Upset me! you may say that," ejaculated Miss Corny, in
          wrath. "It has turned my heart and my <pb n="197"/>
          feelings inside out. What do you say? A glass of
          wine? Nonsense! don't talk of wine to me. A heavy
          misfortune has befallen us, Barbara. Archibald—"</p>
  <p>"Upon Archibald!" interrupted Barbara, in her quick
          alarm. "Oh! some accident has happened to him—to the
          railway train! Perhaps he—he—has got his legs
          broken!"</p>
  <p>"I wish to my heart he had!" warmly returned Miss Corny.
          "He and his legs are all right, more's the pity! It
          is worse than that, Barbara."</p>
  <p>Barbara ran over various disasters in her mind; and,
          knowing the bent of Miss Carlyle's disposition,
          began to refer to some pecuniary loss. "Perhaps it
          is about East Lynne," hazarded she. "The Carews may
          not be coming to it."</p>
  <p>"No, they are not coming to it," was the tart retort.
          "Somebody else is, though: my wise brother.
          Archibald has gone and made a fool of himself,
          Barbara, and now he is coming home to live at East
          Lynne."</p>
  <p>Though there was much that was unintelligible to Barbara
          in this, she could not suppress the flush of
          gratification that rose to her cheek and dyed it
          with blushes. "You are going to be taken down a
          notch or two, my lady," thought the clear-sighted
          Miss Carlyle. "The news fell upon me this morning
          like a thunderbolt," she said, aloud. "Old Dill
          brought it to me. I shook him for his pains."</p>
  <p>"Shook old Dill!" reiterated the wondering Barbara.</p>
  <p>"I shook him till my arms ached: he won't forget it in a
          hurry. He has been abetting Archibald in his
          wickedness; concealing things from me that he ought
            <pb n="198"/> to have come and declared; and I am
          not sure that I can't have the two indicted for
          conspiracy."</p>
  <p>Barbara sat, all amazement; without the faintest idea of
          what Miss Corny could be driving at.</p>
  <p>"You remember that child, Mount Severn's daughter? I
          think I see her now, coming into the concertroom, in
          her white robes, and her jewels, and her flowing
          hair, looking like a young princess in a
          fairy-tale—all very well for her, for what she is,
          but not for us."</p>
  <p>"What of her?" uttered Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Archibald has married her."</p>
  <p>In spite of Barbara's full consciousness that she was
          before the penetrating eyes of Miss Corny, and in
          spite of her own efforts for calmness, every feature
          in her face turned of a ghastly whiteness. But, like
          Miss Carlyle, she at first took refuge in
          disbelief.</p>
  <p>"It is not true, Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"It is quite true. They were married yesterday at Castle
          Marling, by Lord Mount Severn's chaplain. Had I
          known it then, and could I have got there, I might
          have contrived to part them, though the Church
          ceremony had passed: I should have tried. But,"
          added the plain-speaking Miss Corny, "yesterday was
          one thing, and to day's another; and of course
          nothing can be done now."</p>
  <p>"Excuse me an instant," gasped Barbara, in a low tone, "I
          forgot to give an order mamma left for the
          servants."</p>
  <p>An order for the servants! She swiftly passed upstairs to
          her own room, and flung herself down on its floor in
          utter anguish. The past had cleared itself of its
          mists; the scales that were before Barbara's eyes
          had fallen from them. She saw now that while she had
            <pb n="199"/> cherished false and delusive hopes,
          in her almost idolatrous passion for Archibald
          Carlyle, she had never been cared for by him. Even
          the previous night she had lain awake some of its
          hours, indulging dreams of the sweetest phantasy—and
          that was the night of his wedding day! With a sharp
          wail of despair, Barbara flung her arms up and
          closed her aching eyes: she knew that from that hour
          her life's sunshine had departed.</p>
  <p>The cry had been louder than she heeded, and one of the
          maids, who was outside the door, opened it gently
          and looked in. There lay Barbara, and there was no
          mistaking that she lay in dire anguish; not of body,
          but of mind. The servant judged it an inopportune
          moment to intrude, and quickly reclosed the
          door.</p>
  <p>Barbara heard the click of the latch, and it recalled her
          to herself; recalled her to reality; to the
          necessity of outwardly surmounting the distress at
          the present moment. She rose up, drank a glass of
          water, mechanically smoothed her hair and her brow,
          so contracted with pain, and forced her manner to
          calmness.</p>
  <p>"Married to another! married to another!" she moaned, as
          she went down the stairs, "and, that other,
            <hi>her!</hi> Oh, fortitude! oh, dissimulation! at
          least come to my aid before his sister!"</p>
  <p>There was actually a smile on her face as she entered the
          room. Miss Carlyle broke open her grievance again
          without delay, as if to compensate for the few
          minutes' imposed silence.</p>
  <p>"As sure as we are living here, I would have tried for a
          commission of lunacy against him, had I known this,
          and so I told Dill. Better have confined him as a
          harmless lunatic for a couple of years, than suffer
          him to go free and obtain his fling in this mad
          manner.</p>
  <pb n="200"/>
  <p>I never thought he would marry: I have warned him against
          it ever since he was in leading-strings."</p>
  <p>"It is an unsuitable match," said Barbara.</p>
  <p>"It is just as suitable as Beauty and the Beast in the
          children's story. She, a high-born beauty, brought
          up to revel in expense, in jewels, in feasts, in
          show; and he, a—a—a—dull bear of a lawyer, like the
          beast in the tale."</p>
  <p>Had Barbara been less miserable, she would have laughed
          outright. Miss Carlyle continued:</p>
  <p>"I have taken my resolution. I go to East Lynne
          to-morrow, and discharge those five dandies of
          servants. I was up there on Saturday, and there were
          all three of my damsels cocketed up in fine
          mousseline-de-laine gowns, with peach bows in their
          caps, and the men in striped jackets, playing at
          footmen. Had I known then that they were Archibald's
          servants, and not hired for the Carews!"</p>
  <p>Barbara said nothing.</p>
  <p>"I shall go up and dismiss the lot, and remove myself and
          servants to East Lynne, and let my own house
          furnished. Expenses will be high enough with
            <hi>her</hi> extravagant habits, too high to keep
          on two households. And a fine sort of household
          Archibald would have of it at East Lynne, with that
          ignorant baby, befrilled, and bejewelled, and
          becurled, to direct it."</p>
  <p>"But will she like that?"</p>
  <p>"If she does not like it, she can lump it," replied Miss
          Carlyle. "And, now that I have told you the news,
          Barbara, I am going back: and I had almost as soon
          have had to tell you that he was put into his
          coffin."</p>
  <p>"Are you sure you are not jealous?" asked Barbara, <pb n="201"/> some uncontrollable impulse prompting
          her to say it.</p>
  <p>"Perhaps I am," returned Miss Carlyle, with asperity.
          "Perhaps, had you brought up a lad as I have brought
          up Archibald, and loved nothing else in the world,
          far or near, you would be jealous, when you found
          him discarding you with contemptuous indifference,
          and taking a young wife to his bosom, to be more to
          him than you had been."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIV. THE EARL'S ASTONISHMENT.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> announcement of the marriage in the
          newspapers was the first intimation of it Lord Mount
          Severn received. He was little less thunderstruck
          than Miss Corny, and came steaming to England the
          same day, thereby missing his wife's letter, which
          gave <hi>her</hi> version of the affair. He met Mr.
          Carlyle and Lady Isabel in London, where they were
          staying, at one of the West-end hotels, for a day or
          two; they were going farther. Isabel was alone when
          the earl was announced.</p>
  <p>"What is the meaning of this, Isabel?" began he, without
          circumlocution of greeting. "You are married!"</p>
  <p>"Yes," she answered, with her pretty, innocent blush.
          "Some days ago."</p>
  <p>"And to Carlyle the lawyer! How did it come about?"</p>
  <p>Isabel began to think how it had come about, sufficiently
          to give a clear answer. "He asked me," she said,
          "and I accepted him. He came to Castle Marling at
          Easter, and asked me then. I was very much
          surprised."</p>
  <p>The earl looked at her attentively. "Why was I kept in
          ignorance of this, Isabel?"</p>
  <pb n="203"/>
  <p>"I did not know you were kept in ignorance of it. Mr.
          Carlyle wrote to you, as did Lady Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn was as a man in the dark, and looked
          like it. "I suppose this comes," soliloquised he
          aloud, "of your father's having allowed the
          gentleman to dance daily attendance at East Lynne.
          And so you fell in love with him."</p>
  <p>"Indeed no," answered she, in an amused tone. "I never
          thought of such a thing as falling in love with Mr.
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Then don't you love him?" abruptly asked the earl.</p>
  <p>"No!" she whispered, timidly. "But I like him much—oh,
          very much. And he is so good to me!"</p>
  <p>The earl stroked his chin, and mused. Isabel had
          destroyed the only conclusion he had been able to
          come to, as to the motives for the hasty marriage.
          "If you do not love Mr. Carlyle, how comes it that
          you are so wise in the distinction between 'liking'
          and 'love?' It cannot be that you love anybody
          else!"</p>
  <p>The question told home, and Isabel turned crimson. "I
          shall love my husband in time," was all she
          answered, as she bent her head, and played nervously
          with her watch-chain.</p>
  <p>"My poor child!" involuntarily exclaimed the earl. But he
          was one who liked to fathom the depth of everything.
          "Who has been staying at Castle Marling since I
          left?" he asked sharply.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Levison came down."</p>
  <p>"I alluded to gentlemen—young men."</p>
  <p>"Only Francis Levison," she replied.</p>
  <p>"Francis Levison! You have never been so foolish as to
          fall in love with <hi>him!</hi> "</p>
  <pb n="204"/>
  <p>The question was so pointed, so abrupt, and Isabel's
          self-consciousness moreover so great, that she
          betrayed lamentable confusion; and the earl had no
          further need to ask. Pity stole into his hard eyes
          as they fixed themselves on her downcast, glowing
          face.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," he gravely began, "Captain Levison is not a
          good man: if ever you were inclined to think him
          one, dispossess your mind of the idea, and hold him
          at arm's distance. Drop his acquaintance; encourage
          no intimacy with him."</p>
  <p>"I have already dropped it," said Isabel, "and I shall
          not take it up again. But Lady Mount Severn must
          think well of him, or she would not have him
          there."</p>
  <p>"She thinks none too well of him; none can, of Francis
          Levison," returned the earl, significantly. "He is
          her cousin, and is one of those idle, vain,
          empty-headed flatterers whom it is her pleasure to
          group about her. Do you be wiser, Isabel. But this
          does not solve the enigma of your marriage with
          Carlyle; on the contrary, it renders it the more
          unaccountable. He must have cajoled you into
          it."</p>
  <p>Before Isabel could reply, Mr. Carlyle entered. He held
          out his hand to the earl: the earl did not appear to
          see it.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," said he, "I am sorry to turn you out, I suppose
          you have only this one sitting-room. I wish to say a
          few words to Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>She quitted them, and the earl wheeled round and faced
          Mr. Carlyle, speaking in a stern, haughty tone.</p>
  <p>"How came this marriage about, sir? Do you possess so
          little honour, that, taking advantage of my <pb n="205"/> absence, you must intrude yourself into
          my family, and clandestinely espouse Lady Isabel
          Vane?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stood confounded, <hi>not</hi> confused. He
          drew himself up to his full height, looking every
          whit as fearless, and far more noble than the peer.
          "My lord, I do not understand you."</p>
  <p>"Yet I speak plainly. What is it but a clandestine
          procedure, to take advantage of a guardian's
          absence, and beguile a young girl into a marriage
          beneath her?"</p>
  <p>"There has been nothing clandestine in my conduct towards
          Lady Isabel Vane; there shall be nothing but honour
          in my conduct towards Lady Isabel Carlyle. Your
          lordship has been misinformed."</p>
  <p>"I have not been informed at all," retorted the earl. "I
          was allowed to learn this from the public papers; I,
          the only relative of Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"When I proposed for Lady Isabel—"</p>
  <p>"But a month ago," sarcastically interrupted the
          earl.</p>
  <p>"But a month ago," calmly repeated Mr. Carlyle, "my first
          action, after Isabel accepted me, was to write to
          you. But, that I imagine you may not have received
          the letter, by stating you first heard of our
          marriage through the papers, I should say the want
          of courtesy lay on your lordship's side, for having
          vouchsafed me no reply to it."</p>
  <p>"What were the contents of the letter?"</p>
  <p>"I stated what had occurred, mentioning what I was able
          to do in the way of settlements, also that both
          Isabel and myself wished that the ceremony might
          take place as soon as might be."</p>
  <p>"And pray where did you address the letter?"</p>
  <p>"Lady Mount Severn could not give me the address. <pb n="206"/> She said, if I would entrust the letter
          to her she would forward it, for she expected daily
          to hear from you. I did give her the letter, and I
          heard no more of the matter, except that her
          ladyship sent me a message, when Isabel was writing
          to me, that as you had returned no reply, you of
          course approved."</p>
  <p>"Is this the fact?" cried the earl.</p>
  <p>"My lord!" coldly replied Mr. Carlyle. "Whatever may be
          my defects in your eyes, I am at least a man of
          truth. Until this moment, the suspicion that you
          were in ignorance of the contemplated marriage never
          occurred to me."</p>
  <p>"So far, then, I beg your pardon, Mr. Carlyle. But how
          came the marriage about at all?—how came it to be
          hurried over in this unseemly fashion? You made the
          offer at Easter, Isabel tells me, and you married
          her three weeks after it."</p>
  <p>"And I would have married her and brought her away the
          day I did make it, had it been practicable,"
          returned Mr. Carlyle. "I have acted throughout for
          her comfort and happiness."</p>
  <p>"Oh, indeed!" returned the earl, returning to his
          disagreeable tone. "Perhaps you will put me in
          possession of the facts, and of your motives."</p>
  <p>"I warn you that the facts, to you, will not bear a
          pleasant sound, Lord Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"Allow me to be the judge of that," said the earl.</p>
  <p>"Business took me to Castle Marling on Good Friday. On
          the following day I called at your house: after your
          own and Isabel's invitation, it was natural I should
          call: in fact, it would have been a breach of good
          feeling not to do so. I found Isabel ill-treated <pb n="207"/> and miserable: far from enjoying a happy
          home in your house—"</p>
  <p>"What, sir?" interrupted the earl. "Ill-treated and
          miserable!"</p>
  <p>"Ill-treated, even to blows, my lord."</p>
  <p>The earl stood as one petrified, staring at Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I learnt it, I must premise, through the chattering
          revelations of your little son; Isabel of course
          would not have mentioned it to me: but when the
          child had spoken, she did not deny it. In short, she
          was too broken-hearted, too completely bowed in
          spirit, to deny it. It aroused all my feelings of
          indignation: it excited in me an irresistible desire
          to emancipate her from this cruel life, and take her
          where she would find affection and—I hope—happiness.
          There was only one way in which I could do this, and
          I risked it. I asked her to become my wife, and to
          return to her home at East Lynne."</p>
  <p>The earl was slowly recovering from his petrifaction.
          "Then—am I to understand, that when you called that
          day at my house, you carried no intention with you
          of proposing to Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"Not any. It was a sudden step, the circumstances under
          which I found her calling it forth."</p>
  <p>The earl paced the room, perplexed still, and evidently
          disturbed. "May I inquire if you love her?" he
          abruptly said.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle paused ere he spoke, and a red flush dyed his
          face. "Those are feelings man rarely acknowledges to
          man, Lord Mount Severn, but I will answer you. I do
          love her, passionately and sincerely. I learnt to
          love her at East Lynne; but I could have <pb n="208"/> carried my love silently within me to the end of
          my life, and never betrayed it; but for that
          unexpected visit to Castle Marling. If the idea of
          making her my wife had not previously occurred to me
          as practicable, it was that I deemed her rank
          incompatible with my own."</p>
  <p>"As it was," said the earl.</p>
  <p>"Country solicitors have married peers' daughters before
          now," remarked Mr. Carlyle. "I only add another to
          the list."</p>
  <p>"But you cannot keep her as a peer's daughter, I
          presume?"</p>
  <p>"East Lynne will be her home. Our establishment will be
          small and quiet, as compared with her father's. I
          explained to Isabel how quiet at the first, and she
          might have retracted, had she wished: I explained
          also in full to Lady Mount Severn. East Lynne will
          descend to our eldest son, should we have children.
          My profession is most lucrative, my income good:
          were I to die to-morrow, Isabel would enjoy East
          Lynne, and about three thousand pounds per annum. I
          gave these details in the letter which appears to
          have miscarried."</p>
  <p>The earl made no immediate reply: he was absorbed in
          thought.</p>
  <p>"Your lordship perceives, I hope, that there has been
          nothing 'clandestine' in my conduct to Lady
          Isabel."</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn held out his hand. "I refused your hand
          when I came in, Mr. Carlyle, as you may have
          observed: perhaps you will refuse yours now, though
          I should be proud to shake it. When I find myself in
          the wrong, I am not above acknowledging the fact:
          and I must state my opinion that you have behaved
          most kindly and honourably."</p>
  <pb n="209"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle smiled and put his hand into the earl's. The
          latter retained it, while he spoke in a whisper.</p>
  <p>"Of course I cannot be ignorant that, in speaking of
          Isabel's ill-treatment, you alluded to my wife. Has
          it transpired beyond yourselves?"</p>
  <p>"You may be sure that neither Isabel nor myself would
          mention it: we shall dismiss it from amongst our
          reminiscences. Let it be as though you had never
          heard it: it is past and done with."</p>
  <p>"Isabel," said the earl, as he was departing that
          evening, for he remained to spend the day with them,
          "I came here this morning almost prepared to strike
          your husband, and I go away honouring him. Be a good
          and faithful wife to him, for he deserves it."</p>
  <p>"Of course I shall," she answered, in surprise.</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn went on to Castle Marling, and there he
          had a stormy interview with his wife: so stormy that
          the sounds penetrated to the ears of the domestics.
          He left again the same day, in anger, and proceeded
          to Mount Severn.</p>
  <p>"He will have time to cool down before we meet in
          London," was the comment of my lady.</p>
  <pb n="210"/>
                                </div>
                                <div type="chapter">
  <head>CHAPTER XV. COMING HOME.</head>
  <p><hi>Miss Carlyle</hi> was as good as her word. She
          quitted her own house, and removed to East Lynne
          with Peter and two of her handmaidens. In spite of
          Mr. Dill's grieved remonstrances, she discharged the
          servants whom Mr. Carlyle had engaged, all save one
          man: she might have retained one of the maids also,
          but for the episode of the mousseline-de-laine
          dresses and the caps with peach bows: for she had
          the sense to remember, in spite of her prejudices,
          that East Lynne would require more hands in its
          service than her own home.</p>
  <p>On a Friday night, about a month after the wedding, Mr.
          Carlyle and his wife came home. They were expected,
          and Miss Carlyle went through the hall to receive
          them, and stood on the upper steps, between the
          pillars of the portico. An elegant chariot with
          four-post horses was drawing up: Miss Carlyle
          compressed her lips as she scanned it. She was
          attired in a handsome dark silk dress and a new cap:
          her anger had had time to cool down in the last
          month, and her strong common sense told her that the
          wiser plan would be to make the best of it. Mr.
          Carlyle came up the steps with Isabel.</p>
  <pb n="211"/>
  <p>"You here, Cornelia! that was kind. How are you? Isabel,
          this is my sister.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel put forth her hand, and Miss Carlyle
          condescended to touch the tips of her fingers. "I
          hope you are well, ma'am," she jerked out.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle left them together, and went back to search
          for some trifles which had been left in the
          carriage. Miss Carlyle led the way to a
          sitting-room, where the supper-tray was laid. "You
          would like to go up-stairs and take your things off
          before supper, ma'am?" she said, in the same jerking
          tone to Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Thank you. I will go to my rooms, but I do not require
          supper. We have dined."</p>
  <p>"Then what would you like to take?" asked Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>"Some tea, if you please. I am very thirsty."</p>
  <p>"Tea!" ejaculated Miss Corny. "So late as this! I don't
          know that they have boiling water. You'd never sleep
          a wink all night, ma'am, if you took tea at eleven
          o'clock."</p>
  <p>"Oh—then never mind," replied Lady Isabel. "It is of no
          consequence. Do not let me give trouble."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle whisked out of the room; upon what errand
          was best known to herself; and in the hall she and
          Marvel came to an encounter. No words passed, but
          each eyed the other grimly. Marvel was very stylish,
          with five flounces to her dress, a veil and a
          parasol. Meanwhile, Lady Isabel sat down and burst
          into tears and sobs. A chill had come over her: it
          did not seem like coming home to East Lynne. Mr.
          Carlyle entered and witnessed the grief.</p>
  <pb n="212"/>
  <p>"Isabel!" he uttered in amazement, as he hastened up to
          her. "My darling, what ails you?"</p>
  <p>"I am tired, I think," she gently answered; "and coming
          into the house again made me think of papa. I should
          like to go to my-rooms, Archibald, but I don't know
          which they are."</p>
  <p>Neither did Mr. Carlyle know, but Miss Carlyle came
          whisking in again, and said, "The best rooms; those
          next the library. Should she go up with my
          lady?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle preferred to go himself, and he held out his
          arm to Isabel. She drew her veil over her face as
          she passed Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>The branches were not lighted, and the room looked cold
          and comfortless. "Things seem all at sixes and
          sevens in the house," remarked Mr. Carlyle. "I fancy
          the servants must have misunderstood my letter, and
          not have expected us until to-morrow night."</p>
  <p>"Archibald," she said, taking off her bonnet, "I do feel
          very tired, and—and—low spirited: may I undress at
          once, and not go down again to-night?"</p>
  <p>He looked at her and smiled. " <hi>May</hi> you not go
          down again! Have you forgotten that you are at last
          in your own home? A happy home, I trust, it will be
          to you, my darling: I will strive to render it
          so."</p>
  <p>She leaned upon him and sobbed aloud. He tenderly bore
          with her mood, soothing her to composure, gently
          kissing the face he held to him, now and then. Oh,
          his was a true heart; he fervently intended to
          cherish this fair flower he had won: but, alas! it
          was just possible he might miss the way, unless he
          could emancipate himself from his sister's thraldom.
          Isabel did not love him; of that she was conscious;
          but her deep and <pb n="213"/> earnest hope by night
          and by day was, that she might learn to love him,
          for she knew that he deserved it.</p>
  <p>They heard Marvel's voice, and Isabel turned, poured out
          some water, and began dashing it over her face and
          eyes. She did not care that Marvel, who was
          haughtily giving orders about some particular trunk,
          should see her grief.</p>
  <p>"What will you take, Isabel?" asked Mr. Carlyle. "Some
          tea?"</p>
  <p>"No, thank you," replied she, remembering Miss Carlyle's
          answer.</p>
  <p>"But you must take something. You complained of thirst in
          the carriage."</p>
  <p>"Water will do—will be the best for me, I mean. Marvel
          can get if for me."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle quitted the room, and the lady's-maid
          undressed her mistress in swelling silence, her
          tongue quivering with its own rage and wrongs.
          Marvel deemed herself worse used than any lady's
          maid ever had been yet. From the very hour of the
          wedding her anger had been gathering, for there had
          been no gentleman-valet to take care of <hi>her</hi>
          during the wedding journey. Bad enough! but she had
          come home to find that there was no staff of upper
          servants at all: no housekeeper; no steward; no, as
          she expressed it, nobody. Moreover, she and Miss
          Carlyle had just come to a clash. Marvel was loftily
          calling about her in the hall for somebody to carry
          up a small parcel, which contained, in fact, her
          lady's dressing-case, and Miss Carlyle had desired
          her to carry it up herself. But that she had learnt
          who the lady was, Marvel in her indignation might
          have felt inclined to throw the dressing-case at her
          head.</p>
  <pb n="214"/>
  <p>"Anything else, my lady?"</p>
  <p>"No," replied Lady Isabel. "You may go."</p>
  <p>Isabel, wrapped in her dressing-gown, her warm slippers
          on, sat with a book; and Marvel, wishing her good
          night, retired. Mr. Carlyle, meanwhile, had sought
          his sister, who, finding she was to be the only one
          to take supper, was then helping herself to the wing
          of a fowl. She had chosen, that day, to dine
          early.</p>
  <p>"Cornelia," he began, "I do not understand all this. I
          don't see my servants, and I see yours. Where are
          mine?"</p>
  <p>"Gone away," said Miss Carlyle, in her decisive, off-hand
          manner.</p>
  <p>"Gone away!" responded Mr. Carlyle. "What for? I believe
          they were excellent servants."</p>
  <p>"Very excellent! Decking themselves out in buff
          mousseline-de-laine dresses on a Saturday morning,
          and fine caps garnished with peach. Never attempt to
          dabble in domestic matters again, Archibald, for you
          only get taken in. Cut me a slice of that
          tongue."</p>
  <p>"But in what did they do wrong?" he repeated, as he
          obeyed her.</p>
  <p>"Archibald Carlyle, how could you go and make a fool of
          yourself? If you must have married, were there not
          plenty of young ladies in your own sphere of
          society—"</p>
  <p>"Stay," he interrupted. "I wrote you a full statement of
          my motives and actions, Cornelia; I concealed
          nothing that it was necessary you should know: I am
          not disposed to enter upon a further discussion of
          the subject, and you must pardon my saying so. Let
          us return to the topic of the servants. Where are
          they?"</p>
  <p>"I sent them away. Because they were superfluous <pb n="215"/> encumbrances," she hastily added, as he
          would have interrupted her. "We have four in the
          house, and my lady has brought a fine maid, I see,
          making five. I have come up here to live."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt checkmated. He had always bowed to the
          will of Miss Corny, but he had an idea that he and
          his wife would be better without her. "And your own
          house?" he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"I have let it furnished: the people entered to-day. You
          cannot turn me out of East Lynne, into the road, or
          to furnished lodgings, Archibald. There will be
          enough expense, without our keeping on two houses:
          and most people, in your place, would jump at the
          prospect of my living here. Your wife will be
          mistress: I do not intend to take her honours from
          her; but I shall save her a world of trouble in
          management, and be as useful to her as a
          housekeeper. She will be glad of that, inexperienced
          as she is: I dare say she never gave a domestic
          order in her life."</p>
  <p>This was a view of the case to Mr. Carlyle, so plausibly
          put, that he began to think it might be all for the
          best. He had great reverence for his sister's
          judgment: force of habit is strong upon all of us.
          Still—he did not know.</p>
  <p>"There is certainly room for you at East Lynne, Cornelia,
          but—"</p>
  <p>"A little too much," put in Miss Corny. "I think a house
          half its size might content us all, and still have
          been grand enough for Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"East Lynne is mine," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"So is your folly," rejoined Miss Cornelia.</p>
  <p>"And with regard to servants," proceeded Mr. Carlyle,
          passing over the remark, "I shall certainly keep as
          many as I deem necessary. I cannot give my wife <pb n="216"/> splendour, but I will give her comfort.
          The horses and carriages will take one man's—"</p>
  <p>Miss Corny turned faint all over. "What on earth are you
          talking of?"</p>
  <p>"I bought a pretty open carriage in town, and a pair of
          ponies for it. The carriage we came home in was Lord
          Mount Severn's present. Post-horses will do for that
          at present, but—"</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald! the sins that you are committing!"</p>
  <p>"Sins!" echoed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Wilful waste makes woful want. I taught that to you as a
          child. To be thrifty is a virtue; to squander is a
          sin."</p>
  <p>"It may be a sin where you cannot afford it. To spend
          wisely is neither a squander nor a sin. Never you
          fear, Cornelia, that I shall run beyond my
          income."</p>
  <p>"Say at once an empty pocket is better than a full one,"
          angrily returned Miss Carlyle. "Did you buy that
          fine piano which has arrived?"</p>
  <p>"It was my present to Isabel."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny groaned. "What did it cost?"</p>
  <p>"The cost is of no consequence. The old piano here was a
          bad one, and I bought a better."</p>
  <p>"What did it cost?" repeated Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"A hundred and twenty guineas," he answered. Obedience to
          her will was yet powerful within him.</p>
  <p>Miss Corny threw up her hands and eyes. At that moment
          Peter entered with some hot water which his master
          had rung for. Mr. Carlyle rose, and looked on the
          sideboard.</p>
  <p>"Where's the wine, Peter?"</p>
  <p>The servant put it out, port and sherry. Mr. Carlyle <pb n="217"/> drank a glass, and then proceeded to mix
          some wine and water. "Shall I mix some for you,
          Cornelia?" he asked.</p>
  <p>"I'll mix for myself if I want any. Who is that for?"</p>
  <p>"Isabel."</p>
  <p>He quitted the room, carrying the wine-and-water, and
          entered his wife's. She was sitting half buried it
          seemed in the arm-chair, her face muffled up. As she
          raised it he saw that it was flushed and agitated,
          that her eyes were bright and her frame was
          trembling.</p>
  <p>"What is the matter?" he hastily asked.</p>
  <p>"I got nervous after Marvel went," she whispered, laying
          hold of him, as if for protection from terror. "I
          could not find the bell, and that made me worse; so
          I came back to the chair and covered my head over,
          hoping somebody would come up."</p>
  <p>"I have been talking to Cornelia. But what made you
          nervous?"</p>
  <p>"Oh! I was very foolish. I kept thinking of frightful
          things; they would come into my mind. Do not blame
          me, Archibald. This is the room papa died in."</p>
  <p>"Blame you, my darling!" he uttered, with deep
          feeling.</p>
  <p>"I thought of a dreadful story about the bats, that the
          servants told—I dare say you never heard it; and I
          kept thinking, 'Suppose they were at the windows
          now, behind the blinds.' And then I was afraid to
          look at the bed: I fancied I might see—You are
          laughing!"</p>
  <p>Yes, he was smiling; for he knew that these moments of
          nervous fear are best met jestingly. He made her <pb n="218"/> drink the wine-and-water, and then he
          showed her where the bell was, ringing it as he did
          so. Its position had been moved in some late
          alternations to the house.</p>
  <p>"Your rooms shall be changed to-morrow, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"No, let us remain in these. I shall like to feel that
          papa was once their occupant. I won't get nervous
          again."</p>
  <p>But, even as she spoke, her actions belied her words. Mr.
          Carlyle had gone to the door and opened it, and she
          flew close up to him, cowering behind him.</p>
  <p>"Shall you be very long, Archibald?" she whispered.</p>
  <p>"Not more than an hour," he answered. But he hastily put
          back one of his hands, and held her tightly in his
          protecting grasp. Marvel was coming along the
          corridor in answer to the bell.</p>
  <p>"Have the goodness to let Miss Carlyle know that I am not
          coming down again to-night," he said.</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle shut the door, and then looked at his wife
          and laughed. "He is very kind to me," thought
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>With the morning began the perplexities of Lady Isabel
          Carlyle. But first of all, just fancy the group at
          breakfast. Miss Carlyle descended in the startling
          costume the reader has seen; took her seat at the
          breakfast-table, and there sat bolt upright. Mr.
          Carlyle came down next; and then Lady Isabel
          entered, in an elegant half-mourning dress with
          flowing black ribbons.</p>
  <p>"Good morning, ma'am. I hope you slept well?" was Miss
          Carlyle's salutation.</p>
  <p>"Quite well, thank you," she answered, as she took her
          seat opposite Miss Carlyle. Miss Carlyle pointed to
          the top of the table.</p>
  <pb n="219"/>
  <p>"That is your place, ma'am. But I will pour out the
          coffee, and save you the trouble, if you wish
          it."</p>
  <p>"I should be glad if you would," answered Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>So Miss Carlyle proceeded to her duties, very stern and
          grim. The meal was nearly over, when Peter came in,
          and said the butcher had come up for orders. Miss
          Carlyle looked at Lady Isabel, waiting, of course,
          for her to give them. Isabel was silent with
          perplexity: she had never given such an order in her
          life. Totally ignorant was she of the requirements
          of a household; and did not know whether to suggest
          a few pounds of meat, or a whole cow. It was the
          presence of that grim Miss Corny which put her out:
          alone with her husband, she would have said, "What
          ought I to order, Archibald? Tell me." Peter
          waited.</p>
  <p>"A—Something to roast and boil, if you please," stammered
          Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>She spoke in a low tone; embarrassment makes cowards of
          the best of us; and Mr. Carlyle repeated it after
          her. He knew no more about housekeeping than she
          did.</p>
  <p>"Something to roast and boil, tell the man, Peter."</p>
  <p>Up started Miss Corny: she could not stand that. "Are you
          aware, Lady Isabel, that an order, such as that,
          would only puzzle the butcher? Shall I give the
          necessary orders for to-day? The fishmonger will be
          up presently."</p>
  <p>"Oh! I wish you would!" cried the relieved Lady Isabel.
          "I have not been accustomed to it; but I must learn.
          I don't think I know anything about
          housekeeping."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny's answer was to stalk from the room.</p>
  <pb n="220"/>
  <p>Isabel rose from her chair, like a bird released from its
          cage, and stood by her husband's side. "Have you
          finished, Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"I think I have, dear. Oh! here's my coffee. There; I
          have finished now."</p>
  <p>"Let us go round the grounds."</p>
  <p>He rose, laid his hands playfully on her slender waist,
          and looked at her. "You may as well ask me to take a
          journey to the moon. It is past nine, and I have not
          been to the office for a month."</p>
  <p>The tears rose in her eyes. "I wish you could stay with
          me! I wish you could be always with me! East Lynne
          will not be East Lynne without you."</p>
  <p>"I will be with you as much as ever I can, my dearest,"
          he whispered. "Come and walk with me through the
          park."</p>
  <p>She ran for her bonnet, gloves, and parasol. Mr. Carlyle
          waited for her in the hall, and they went out
          together.</p>
  <p>He thought it a good opportunity to speak about his
          sister. "She wishes to remain with us," he said. "I
          do not know what to decide. On the one hand, I think
          she might save you the worry of household
          management: on the other, I fancy we shall be
          happier by ourselves."</p>
  <p>Isabel's heart sank within her at the idea of that stern
          Miss Corny, mounted over her as resident guard; but,
          refined and sensitive, almost painfully considerate
          of the feelings of others, she raised no word of
          objection. As he and Miss Carlyle pleased, she
          answered.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," he said, with grave earnestness, "I wish it to
          be as you please: that is, I wish matters to be
          arranged as may best please you; and I will have
          them <pb n="221"/> so arranged. My chief object in
          life now, is your happiness."</p>
  <p>He spoke in all the sincerity of truth, and Isabel knew
          it; and the thought came across her that with him by
          her side, her loving protector, Miss Carlyle could
          not mar her life's peace. "Let her stay, Archibald:
          she will not incommode us."</p>
  <p>"At any rate, it can be tried for a month or two, and we
          shall see how it works," he musingly observed.</p>
  <p>They reached the park gates. "I wish I could go with you
          and be your clerk," she cried, unwilling to release
          his hand. "I should not have all that long way to go
          back by myself."</p>
  <p>He laughed and shook his head, telling her that she
          wanted to bribe him into taking her back, but it
          could not be. And away he went, after saying
          farewell.</p>
  <p>Isabel wandered back: and then wandered through the
          rooms: they looked lonely, not as they had seemed to
          look in her father's time. In her dressing-room
          knelt Marvel, unpacking. She rose when Lady Isabel
          entered.</p>
  <p>"Can I speak to you a moment, if you please, my
          lady?"</p>
  <p>"What is it?"</p>
  <p>Then Marvel poured forth her tale. That she feared so
          small an establishment would not suit her, and if my
          lady pleased she would like to leave at once; that
          day. Anticipating it, she had not unpacked her
          things.</p>
  <p>"There has been some mistake about the servants, Marvel,
          but it will be remedied as soon as possible. And I
          told you, before I married, that Mr. Carlyle's
          establishment would be a limited one."</p>
  <p>"My lady, perhaps I could put up with that; but I never
          could stop in the house with"—that female Guy, <pb n="222"/> had been on the tip of Marvel's tongue;
          but she remembered in time of whom she was
          speaking—"with Miss Carlyle. I fear, my lady, we
          have both got tempers that would clash, and might be
          flying at each other: I could not stop, my lady, for
          untold gold. And if you please to make me forfeit my
          running quarter's salary, why I must do it. So when
          I have set your ladyship's things to rights, I hope
          you'll allow me to go."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel would not condescend to ask her to remain,
          but she wondered how she should manage without a
          maid. She drew her desk towards her. "What is the
          amount due to you?" she inquired, as she unlocked
          it.</p>
  <p>"Up to the end of the quarter, my lady?" cried Marvel, in
          a brisk tone.</p>
  <p>"No," coldly replied Lady Isabel. "Up to to-day."</p>
  <p>"I have not had time to reckon, my lady."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel took a pencil and paper, made out the
          account, and laid it down in gold and silver on the
          table. "It is more than you deserve, Marvel," she
          remarked, "and more than you would get in most
          places. You ought to have given me proper
          notice."</p>
  <p>Marvel melted into tears, and began a string of excuses.
          "She should never have wished to leave so kind a
          lady, but for attendant ill-conveniences, and she
          hoped my lady would not object to testify to her
          character." Lady Isabel quitted the room in the
          midst of it: and in the course of the day Marvel
          took her departure, Joyce telling her that she ought
          to be ashamed of herself.</p>
  <p>"I couldn't help myself," retorted Marvel, "and I'm <pb n="223"/> sorry to leave her, for she's pleasant
          young lady to serve."</p>
  <p>"Well, I know I'd have helped myself," was Joyce's
          remark. "I would not go off in this unhandsome way
          from a good mistress."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps you wouldn't," loftily returned Marvel, "but my
          inside feelings are delicate, and can't bear to be
          trampled upon. The same house is not going to hold
          me and that tall female image, who's more fit to be
          carried about at a foreign carnival than some that
          they do carry."</p>
  <p>So Marvel left. And when Lady Isabel went to her room to
          dress for dinner, Joyce entered it.</p>
  <p>"I am not much accustomed to a lady's maid's duties,"
          said she, "but Miss Carlyle has sent me, my lady, to
          do what I can for you, if you will allow me."</p>
  <p>Isabel thought it was kind of Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"And if you please to trust me with the keys of your
          things, I will take charge of them for you, my lady,
          until you are suited with a maid," Joyce
          resumed.</p>
  <p>"I don't know anything about the keys," answered Isabel.
          "I never keep them."</p>
  <p>Joyce did her best, and Lady Isabel went down. It was
          nearly six o'clock, the dinner hour, and she
          strolled to the park gates, hoping to meet Mr.
          Carlyle. Taking a few steps out, she looked down the
          road, but could not see him coming; so she turned in
          again, and sat down under a shady tree and out of
          view of the road. It was remarkably warm weather for
          the closing days of May.</p>
  <p>Half an hour, and then Mr. Carlyle came pelting up,
          passed the gates, and turned on to the grass. There
            <pb n="224"/> was his wife. She had fallen asleep,
          her head leaning against the trunk of the tree. Her
          bonnet and parasol lay at her feet, her scarf had
          dropped, and she looked like a lovely child, her
          lips partly open, her cheeks flushed, and her
          beautiful hair falling around. It was an exquisite
          picture, and his heart beat quicker within him as he
          felt it was his own. A smile stole over his lips as
          he stood looking at her. She opened her eyes, and
          for a moment could not remember where she was. Then
          she started up.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald! have I been asleep?"</p>
  <p>"Ay; and might have been stolen and carried off. I could
          not afford that, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"I don't know how I came to fall asleep. I was listening
          for you."</p>
  <p>"What have you been doing all day?" he asked, as he drew
          her arm within his, and they walked on.</p>
  <p>"Oh, I hardly know," she sighed. "Trying the new piano,
          and looking at my watch, wishing the time would go
          quicker, that you might come home. The ponies and
          carriage have arrived, Archibald."</p>
  <p>"I know they have, my dear. Have you been out of doors
          much?"</p>
  <p>"No, I waited for you," And then she told him about
          Marvel. He felt vexed, saying she must replace her
          with all speed. Isabel said she knew of one, a young
          woman who had left Lady Mount Severn while she,
          Isabel, was at Castle Marling: her health was
          delicate, and Lady Mount Severn's place too hard for
          her.</p>
  <p>"Write to her," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"You have kept dinner waiting more than half an hour,"
          began Miss Corny, in a loud tone of complaint, <pb n="225"/> to her brother, meeting them in the
          hall. "And I thought you must be lost, ma'am," she
          added, to Isabel.</p>
  <p>Why in the world did she tack on that objectionable
          "ma'am," to every sentence? It was out of place in
          all respects to Isabel: more especially considering
          her own age and Isabel's youth. Mr. Carlyle knitted
          his brow whenever it came out, and Joyce felt sure
          that Miss Corny did it "in her temper." He hastily
          answered her that he could not get away from the
          office earlier, and went up to his dressing-room.
          Isabel hurried after him, probably dreading some
          outbreak of Miss Carlyle's displeasure, but the door
          was shut, and, scarcely at home yet as a wife, she
          did not like to open it. When he appeared, there she
          was, leaning against the door-post.</p>
  <p>"Isabel! Are you there?</p>
  <p>"I am waiting for you. Are you ready?"</p>
  <p>"Nearly." He drew her inside, caught her to him, and held
          her against his heart.</p>
  <p>There was an explosion on the following morning. Mr.
          Carlyle ordered the pony-carriage for church, but
          his sister interrupted him.</p>
  <p>"Archibald! what are you thinking of? I will not permit
          it."</p>
  <p>"Permit what?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"The cattle to be taken out on a Sunday. I am a religious
          woman, ma'am," she added, turning sharply to Isabel,
          "and I cannot countenance Sunday travelling. I was
          taught my catechism, Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>Isabel did not feel comfortable. She knew that a walk to
          St. Jude's church and back in the present heat would
          knock her up for the day, but she shrank from <pb n="226"/> offending Miss Carlyle's prejudices. She
          was standing at the window with her husband; Miss
          Carlyle being seated at a distant table, with the
          Bible before her.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, perhaps if we walk very slowly it will not
          hurt me," she softly whispered.</p>
  <p>He smiled and nodded, and whispered in return. "Be quite
          ready by half-past ten."</p>
  <p>"Well—is she going to walk?" snapped Miss Corny, as
          Isabel left the room.</p>
  <p>"No. She could not bear the walk in this heat, and I
          shall certainly not allow her to attempt it. We
          shall go early. John will put up the ponies, and be
          at church before the service begins."</p>
  <p>"Is she made of glass, that she'd melt?" retorted Miss
          Corny,</p>
  <p>"She is a gentle, tender plant; one that I have taken to
          my bosom and vowed before my Maker to love and to
          cherish: and, by His help, I will do so."</p>
  <p>He spoke in a firm tone, almost as sharp as Miss Corny's,
          and quitted the room. Miss Carlyle raised her hand
          and pressed it upon her temples: as if something
          pained her there.</p>
  <p>The carriage came round, a beautiful little equipage, and
          Isabel was ready. As Mr. Carlyle drove slowly down
          the dusty road they came upon Miss Corny striding
          along in the sun, with a great umbrella over her
          head. She would not turn to look at them.</p>
  <p>Once more, as in the year gone by, St Jude's church was
          in a flutter of expectation. It expected to see a
          whole paraphernalia of bridal finery, and again it
          was doomed to disappointment, for Isabel had not put
          off the mourning for her father. She was in black, a
          thin gauze dress, and her white bonnet had small
          black flowers <pb n="227"/> inside and out. For the
          first time in his life Mr. Carlyle took possession
          of the pew belonging to East Lynne, filling the
          place where the poor earl used to sit. Not so Miss
          Corny: she sat in her own.</p>
  <p>Barbara was there with the justice and Mrs. Hare. Her
          face wore a grey, dusky hue, of which she was only
          too conscious, but could not subdue. Her covetous
          eyes would wander to that other face with its
          singular loveliness and its sweetly earnest eyes,
          sheltered under the protection of him, for whose
          sheltering protection she had so long yearned. Poor
          Barbara did not benefit much by the services that
          day.</p>
  <p>Afterwards, they went across the churchyard to the west
          corner, where stood the tomb of Lord Mount Severn.
          Isabel looked at the inscription, her veil shading
          her face.</p>
  <p>"Not here, and now, my darling," he whispered, pressing
          her arm to his side, for he felt her silent sobs.
          "Strive for calmness."</p>
  <p>"It seems but the other day he was at church with me, and
          now—here!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle suddenly changed their places, so that they
          stood with their backs to the hedge, and to any
          staring stragglers who might be lingering in the
          road.</p>
  <p>"There ought to be railings round the tomb," she
          presently said, after a successful battle with her
          emotion.</p>
  <p>"I thought so, and I suggested it to Lord Mount Severn,
          but he appeared to think differently. I will have it
          done."</p>
  <p>"I put you to great expense," she said.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced quickly at her, a dim fear
          penetrating <pb n="228"/> his mind that his sister
          might have been <hi>talking</hi> in her hearing. "An
          expense I would not be without for the whole world.
          You know it, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"And I have nothing to repay you with," she sighed.</p>
  <p>He looked excessively amused; and, gazing into her face,
          the expression of his eyes made her smile. "Here is
          John with the carriage," she exclaimed. "Let us go,
          Archibald."</p>
  <p>Standing outside the gates, talking to the rector's
          family, were several ladies, one of them Barbara
          Hare. She watched Mr. Carlyle place his wife in the
          carriage, she watched him drive away. Barbara's very
          lips were white as she bowed in return to his
          greeting.</p>
  <p>"The heat is so great," murmured Barbara, when those
          around noticed her paleness.</p>
  <p>"Ah! you ought to have gone home in the phaeton with Mr.
          and Mrs. Hare—as they desired you."</p>
  <p>"I wished to walk," returned the unhappy Barbara.</p>
  <p>"What a pretty girl!" said Lady Isabel to her husband.
          "What is her name?"</p>
  <p>"Barbara Hare."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVI. BARBARA HARE'S REVELATION.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> county carriages began to arrive at East
          Lynne, to pay the wedding visit to Mr. and Lady
          Isabel Carlyle. Some appeared with all the pomp of
          coronets and hammercloths, and bedizened footmen
          with calves and wigs and gold-headed canes; some
          came with four horses, and some even with outriders.
          It is the custom still in certain localities to be
          preceded by outriders when paying visits of
          ceremony, and there are people who like the dash.
          Mr. Carlyle might have taken up his abode at East
          Lynne without any such honours being paid him, but
          his marriage with Lady Isabel had sent him up in
          county estimation. Amongst the rest, went Justice
          and Mrs. Hare and Barbara. The oldfashioned, large
          yellow chariot was brought out, and the fat, sleek,
          long-tailed coach-horses: only on state occasions
          was that chariot awakened out of its repose.</p>
  <p>Isabel happened to be in her dressing-room talking to
          Joyce. She had grown to like Joyce very much, and
          was asking her whether she would continue to wait
          upon her—as the maid, for whom she had written, was
          not well enough to come.</p>
  <p>Joyce's face lighted up with pleasure at the proposal.
          "Oh, my lady, you are very kind! I should so like
          it. <pb n="230"/> I would serve you faithfully to
          the best of my ability: and I know I could do your
          hair well, if you allowed me to try: I have been
          practising upon my own, night and morning."</p>
  <p>Isabel laughed. "But Miss Carlyle may not be inclined to
          transfer you."</p>
  <p>"I think she would be, my lady. She said, a day or two
          ago, that I appeared to suit you, and you might have
          me altogether if you wished, provided I could still
          make her gowns. Which I could very well do, for
          yours is an easy service. I make them to please her,
          you see, my lady."</p>
  <p>"Do you make her caps also?" demurely asked Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>Joyce smiled. "Yes, my lady: but I am allowed to make
          them only according to her own pattern."</p>
  <p>"Joyce, if you become my maid, you must wear smarter caps
          yourself."</p>
  <p>"I know that, my lady—at least, different ones. But Miss
          Carlyle is very particular, and only allows muslin
          caps to her servants. I would wear plain white net
          ones, if you don't object, my lady: neat and close,
          with a little quilled white ribbon."</p>
  <p>"They are the best that you can wear. I do not wish you
          to be fine, like Marvel."</p>
  <p>"Oh, my lady! I shall never be fine," shuddered Joyce.
          And Joyce believed she had cause to shudder at
          finery. She was about to speak further, when a knock
          came to the dressing-room door. Joyce went to open
          it, and saw one of the housemaids, a girl who had
          recently been engaged, a native of West Lynne.
          Isabel heard the colloquy:</p>
  <p>"Is my lady there?"</p>
  <pb n="231"/>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Some visitors. Peter ordered me to come and tell you. I
          say, Joyce, it's the Hares. And <hi>she's</hi> with
          them. Her bonnet's got blue convolvulums inside, and
          a white feather on the out, as long as Martha's
          back'us hearth-broom. I watched her get out of the
          carriage."</p>
  <p>"Who?" sharply returned Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Why, Miss Barbara. Only fancy her coming to pay the
          wedding visit <hi>here</hi> . My lady had better
          take care that she don't get a bowl of poison mixed
          for her. Master's out, or else I'd have given a
          shilling to see the interview between the
          three."</p>
  <p>Joyce sent the girl away, shut the door, and turned to
          her mistress, quite unconscious that the
          halfwhispered conversation had been audible.</p>
  <p>"Some visitors in the drawing-room, my lady, Susan says.
          Mr. Justice Hare and Mrs. Hare, and Miss
          Barbara."</p>
  <p>Isabel descended, her mind full of the mysterious words
          spoken by Susan. The justice was in a new flaxen
          wig, obstinate-looking and pompous; Mrs. Hare pale,
          delicate, and lady-like; Barbara, beautiful: such
          was the impression they made upon Isabel.</p>
  <p>They paid rather a long visit. Isabel quite fell in love
          with the gentle and suffering Mrs. Hare, who had
          risen to leave when Miss Carlyle entered. Miss
          Carlyle wished them to remain longer, had something,
          she said, to show Barbara. The justice declined: he
          had a brother justice coming to dine with him at
          five; it was then half-past four: Barbara might stay
          if she liked.</p>
  <p>Barbara's face turned crimson: but nevertheless she
          accepted the invitation, proffered her by Miss
          Carlyle, to remain at East Lynne for the rest of the
          day.</p>
  <pb n="232"/>
  <p>Dinner-time approached, and Isabel went up to dress for
          it. Joyce was waiting, and entered upon the subject
          of the service.</p>
  <p>"My lady, I have spoken to Miss Carlyle, and she is
          willing that I should be transferred to you, but she
          says I ought first of all to acquaint you with
          certain unpleasant facts in my history, and the same
          thought had occurred to me. Miss Carlyle is not over
          pleasant in manner, my lady, but she is very upright
          and just."</p>
  <p>"What facts?" asked Lady Isabel, sitting down to have her
          hair brushed.</p>
  <p>"My lady, I'll tell you as shortly as I can. My father
          was a clerk in Mr. Carlyle's office—of course I mean
          the late Mr. Carlyle. My mother died when I was
          eight years old, and my father afterwards married
          again, a sister of Mr. Kane's wife—"</p>
  <p>"Mr. Kane the music-master?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, my lady. She was a governess; she and Mrs. Kane had
          both been governesses, they were quite ladies, so
          far as education and manners went, and West Lynne
          said that in stooping to marry my father she lowered
          herself dreadfully. But he was a very handsome man,
          and a clever man also, though self-taught. Well,
          they married, and at the end of a year Afy was
          born—"</p>
  <p>"Who?" interrupted Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"My half-sister, Afy. In another year her mother died,
          and an aunt of her mother sent for the child, and
          said she should bring her up. I remained at home
          with my father, going to school by day, and when I
          grew up, I went by day to learn millinery and
          dressmaking. We lived in the prettiest cottage, my
          lady, it was in the wood, and it was my father's
          own. After I was out of my time, I used to go round
          to different <pb n="233"/> ladies' houses to work,
          seeing to my father's comforts night and morning,
          for the woman who did the house-work only came in
          for a few hours in the day. That went on for years,
          and then Afy came home. Her aunt had died, and her
          money died with her, so that though she had brought
          up Afy well, she could leave her nothing. Afy quite
          frightened us. Her notions were fine, and her dress
          was fine; she was gay and giddy and very pretty, and
          would do nothing all day but read books, which she
          used to get at the West Lynne library. My father did
          not like it: we were only plain working people, and
          she wanted to set up for a lady—the effect of
          bringing her up above her station. Many a breeze had
          she and I together, chiefly about her dress. The
          next thing, she got acquainted with young Richard
          Hare."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Justice Hare's only son; own brother to Miss
          Barbara," proceeded Joyce, dropping her voice, as
          though Barbara could hear her in the drawing-room.
          "Oh, she was very flighty; she encouraged Mr.
          Richard, and he soon grew to love her with quite a
          wild sort of love; he was rather simple, and Afy
          used to laugh at him behind his back. She encouraged
          others, too, and would have them there in an
          evening, when the house was free. My father was
          secretary to the literary institution, and had to be
          there two evenings in the week, after office hours
          at Mr. Carlyle's; he was fond of shooting, too, and,
          if home in time, would go out with his gun; and as I
          scarcely ever got home before nine o'clock, Afy was
          often alone, and she took the opportunity to have
          one or other of her admirers there."</p>
  <pb n="234"/>
  <p>"Had she many admirers?" asked Lady Isabel, who seemed
          inclined to treat the tale in a joking spirit.</p>
  <p>"The chief one, my lady, was Richard Hare. She got
          acquainted with somebody else, a stranger, who used
          to ride over from a distance to see her; but I fancy
          there was nothing in it; Mr. Richard was the one.
          And it went on, and on, till—till—he killed her
          father."</p>
  <p>"Who?" uttered the startled Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Richard Hare, my lady. My father had told Afy that Mr.
          Richard should not come there any longer, for when
          gentlemen go in secret after poor girls, it is well
          known they have not marriage in their thoughts: my
          father would have interfered more than he did, but
          that he judged well of Mr. Richard, and did not
          think he was one to do Afy real harm—but he did not
          know how flighty she was. However, one day he heard
          people talking about it in. West Lynne, coupling her
          name and Mr. Richard's offensively together, and at
          night he told Afy, before me, that it should not go
          on any longer, and she must not encourage him. My
          lady, the next night Richard Hare shot my
          father."</p>
  <p>"How very dreadful!"</p>
  <p>"Whether it was done on purpose, or whether the gun went
          off in in a scuffle, I can't tell: people think it
          was wilful murder. I never shall forget the scene,
          my lady, when I got home that night: it was at
          Justice Hare's that I had been working. My father
          was lying on the floor, dead; and the house and was
          full of people, Afy could give no particulars: she
          had gone out to the wood path at the back, and never
          heard or saw anything amiss; but when she went in
          again, there lay <pb n="235"/> father. Mr. Locksley
          was leaning over him; he told Afy that he had heard
          the shot, and came up in time to see Richard Hare
          fling the gun away, and fly from the house with his
          shoes stained with blood."</p>
  <p>"Oh Joyce! I do not like to hear this. What was done to
          Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>"He escaped, my lady. He went off that same night and has
          never been heard of since. There's a judgment of
          murder out against him, and his own father would be
          the first to deliver him up to justice. It is a
          dreadful thing to have befallen the Hare family, who
          are most high and respectable people: it is killing
          Mrs. Hare by inches. Afy—"</p>
  <p>"What is it, that name, Joyce?"</p>
  <p>"My lady, she was christened by a very fine name—
          Aphrodite: so I and my father never called her
          anything but Afy. But I have got the worst to tell
          you yet, my lady—the worst as regards her. As soon
          as the inquest was over she went off, after Richard
          Hare."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel uttered an exclamation.</p>
  <p>"She did indeed, my lady," returned Joyce, turning away
          her moist eyelashes and her shamed cheeks from the
          gaze of her mistress. "Nothing has been heard of
          either of them: and it is hardly likely but what
          they went out of England—perhaps to Australia;
          perhaps to America; nobody knows. What with the
          shame of that, and the shock of my poor father's
          murder, I had an attack of illness. It was a nervous
          fever, and it lasted long: Miss Carlyle had me at
          her house, and she and her servants nursed me
          through it. She's good at heart, my lady, is Miss
          Carlyle, only her manners are against her, and she
          will think herself better than other <pb n="236"/>
          people. After that illness, I stayed with her as
          upper maid, and never went out to work again."</p>
  <p>"How long is it since this happened?"</p>
  <p>"It will be four years next September, my lady. The
          cottage has stood empty ever since, for nobody will
          live in it; they say it smells of murder. And I
          can't sell it, because Afy has a right in it as well
          as I. I go to it sometimes, and open the windows,
          and air it. And this was what I had to tell you, my
          lady, before you decide to take me into your
          service: it is not every lady would like to engage
          one, whose sister has turned out so badly."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel did not see that it ought to make any
          difference. She said so; and then leaned back in her
          chair, and mused.</p>
  <p>"Which dress, my lady?"</p>
  <p>"Joyce, what was that I heard you and Susan gossiping
          over at the door?" Lady Isabel suddenly asked.
          "About Miss Hare giving me a bowl of poison. You
          should tell Susan not to make her whispers so
          loud."</p>
  <p>Joyce smiled; though she was rather confused. "It was
          only a bit of nonsense, of course, my lady. The fact
          is, that people think Miss Barbara was much attached
          to Mr. Carlyle, regularly in love with him, and many
          thought it would be a match. But I don't fancy she
          would have been the one to make him happy, with all
          her love."</p>
  <p>A hot flush passed over the brow of Lady Isabel; a
          sensation very like jealousy flew to her heart. No
          woman likes to hear that another woman either is or
          has been attached to her husband: a doubt always
          arises whether the feeling may not have been
          reciprocated.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel descended. She wore a costly black <pb n="237"/> lace dress its low body and sleeves
          trimmed with white lace as costly: and ornaments of
          jet. She looked inexpressibly beautiful, and Barbara
          turned from her with a feeling of sickening
          jealousy; from her beauty, from her attire, even
          from the fine, soft handkerchief, which displayed
          the badge of her rank—the coronet of an earl's
          daughter. Barbara looked well too: she was in a
          light blue silk robe, and her pretty cheeks were
          damask with her mind's excitement. On her neck she
          wore the gold chain given to her by Mr. Carlyle—she
          had not discarded that.</p>
  <p>They stood together at the window looking at Mr. Carlyle
          as he came up the avenue. He saw them, and nodded.
          Lady Isabel watched the damask cheeks turn to
          crimson at sight of him.</p>
  <p>"How do you do, Barbara?" he cried, as he shook hands.
          "Come to pay us a visit at last! you have been tardy
          over it. And how are you, my darling?" he whispered,
          bending over his wife: but she missed his kiss of
          greeting. Well; would she have had him give it her
          in public? No: but she was in the mood to notice the
          omission.</p>
  <p>Dinner over, Miss Carlyle beguilded Barbara out of doors.
          To exhibit the beauties of the East Lynne
          pleasure-grounds, the rarities of the conservatory,
          thinks the reader. Not at all: she was anxious to
          show off the stock of vegetables, the asparagus and
          cucumber beds; worth a hundred acres of flowers in
          Miss Carlyle's estimation. Barbara went unwillingly:
          she would rather be in <hi>his</hi> presence than
          away from it; and she could not help feeling this,
          although he was the husband of another. Isabel
          remained in-doors: Barbara was Miss Carlyle's
          guest.</p>
  <pb n="238"/>
  <p>"How do you like her?" abruptly asked Barbara, alluding
          to Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Better than I thought I should," acknowledged Miss
          Carlyle. "I had expected airs and graces and
          pretence, and I must say she is free from them. She
          seems quite wrapped up in Archibald, and watches for
          his coming home like a cat watches for a mouse. She
          is dull without him."</p>
  <p>Barbara plucked a rose as they passed a bush, and began
          pulling it to pieces, leaf by leaf. "Dull! how does
          she employ her time?"</p>
  <p>"In doing nothing," snappishly retorted Miss Carlyle.
          "Sings a bit, and plays a bit, and reads a bit, and
          receives her visitors, and idles away her days in
          that manner. She coaxes Archibald out here after
          breakfast, and he ought not to let himself be
          coaxed, making him late at his office; and then she
          dances down to the park gates with him, hindering
          him still further, for he would go alone in half the
          time. One morning it poured with rain; she actually
          went all the same. I told her she would spoil her
          dress: oh, that was nothing, she said: and Archibald
          wrapped a shawl round her and took her. Of course
          the spoiling of dresses is nothing to her! And in an
          evening she goes down to meet him again; she would
          have gone to-day if you had not been here. Oh, she
          is first with him now; business is second."</p>
  <p>Barbara compelled her manner to indifference. "I suppose
          it is natural."</p>
  <p>"I suppose it is absurd," was the retort of Miss Carlyle.
          "I give them very little of my company, especially
          in an evening. They go strolling out together, or
          she sings to him, he hanging over her as if <pb n="239"/> she were gold; to judge by appearances,
          she is more precious to him than any gold that ever
          was coined into money. I'll tell you what I saw last
          night. They had post-horses to the close carriage
          yesterday, and went to return some visits, never
          getting home till past seven, and keeping me and
          dinner waiting. Archibald had what he is not often
          subject to, a severe headache, and he went in the
          next room after dinner, and lay on the sofa. She
          carried a cup of tea to him, and never came back,
          leaving her own on the table till it was perfectly
          cold. I pushed open the door to tell her so. There
          was my lady's cambric handkerchief, soaked in
          eau-de-Cologne lying on his forehead; and there was
          my lady herself, kneeling down and looking at him,
          he with his arm thrown round her to hold her there.
          Now I just ask you, Barbara, whether there's any
          sense in fadding with a man like that? If ever he
          had the headache before he was married, I used to
          mix him up a good dose of salts and senna, and tell
          him to go to bed early and sleep the pain off."</p>
  <p>Barbara made no reply: but she turned her face from Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>They came upon the gardener, and Miss Carlyle got into a
          discussion with him, a somewhat warm one; she
          insisting upon having certain work done in a certain
          way; he standing to it that Mr. Carlyle had ordered
          it done in another. Barbara grew tired, and returned
          to the house.</p>
  <p>Isabel and her husband were in the adjoining room, at the
          piano, and Barbara had an opportunity of hearing
          that sweet voice. She did as Miss Carlyle confessed
          to have done, pushed open the door between the two
          rooms, and looked in. It was the twilight hour, <pb n="240"/> almost too dusk to see; but she could
          distinguish Isabel seated at the piano, and Mr.
          Carlyle standing behind her. She was singing one of
          the ballads from the opera of the "Bohemian Girl,"
          "When other lips."</p>
  <p>"Why do you like the song so much, Archibald?" she asked,
          when she had finished it.</p>
  <p>"I don't know. I never liked it so much until I heard it
          from you."</p>
  <p>"I wonder if they are come in. Shall we go into the next
          room?"</p>
  <p>"Just this one first, this translation from the German,
          ''Twere vain to tell thee all I feel.' There's real
          music in that song."</p>
  <p>"Yes, there is. Do you know, Archibald, your taste is
          just like papa's. He liked all these quiet,
          imaginative songs, and so do you. And so do I," she
          laughingly added, "if I must speak the truth. Mrs.
          Vane used to stop her ears and make a face, when
          papa made me sing them. Papa returned the
          compliment; for he would walk out of the room if she
          began her loud Italian songs. I speak of the time
          when she was with us in London."</p>
  <p>She ceased, and began the song, singing it exquisitely,
          in a low, sweet, earnest tone, the chords of the
          accompaniment, at its conclusion, dying off
          gradually into silence.</p>
  <p>"There, Archibald! I am sure I have sung you ten songs at
          least," she said, leaning her head back against him
          and looking at him from her upturned face.</p>
  <p>"You ought to pay me."</p>
  <p>He did pay her; holding the dear face to him, and taking
          from it some impassioned kisses. Barbara turned <pb n="241"/> to the window, a low moan of pain
          escaping her, as she pressed her forehead on one of
          its panes, and looked forth at the dusky night.
          Isabel came in on her husband's arm.</p>
  <p>"Are you here alone, Miss Hare? I really beg your pardon.
          I supposed you were with Miss Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Where is Cornelia, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"I have but just come in," was Barbara's reply. "I dare
          say she is following me."</p>
  <p>So she was, for she came upon them as they were speaking,
          her voice raised to tones of anger.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, what have you been telling Blair about that
          geranium bed? He says you have been ordering him to
          make it oval. We decided that it should be
          square."</p>
  <p>"Isabel would prefer it oval," was his reply.</p>
  <p>"But it will be best square," repeated Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It is all right, Cornelia; Blair has his orders. I wish
          it to be oval."</p>
  <p>"He is a regular muff, is that Blair, and as obstinate as
          a mule," cried Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Indeed then, Cornelia, I think him a very civil, good
          servant."</p>
  <p>"Oh, of course," snapped Miss Carlyle. "You never can see
          faults in anybody. You always were a simpleton in
          some things, Archibald."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed good humouredly; he was of an even,
          calm temper: and he had, all his life, been
          subjected to the left handed compliments of his
          sister. Isabel resented these speeches in her heart;
          she was growing more attached to her husband day by
          day. "It is well everybody does not think so," cried
          he, <pb n="242"/> with a glance at his wife and
          Barbara, as they drew round the tea-table.</p>
  <p>The evening went on to ten, and as the time-piece struck
          the hour, Barbara rose from her chair in amazement.
          "I did not think it was so late. Surely some one
          must have come for me."</p>
  <p>"I will inquire," was Lady Isabel's answer; and Mr.
          Carlyle rang the bell. No one had come for Miss
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"Then I fear I must trouble Peter," cried Barbara. "Mamma
          may be gone to rest, tired, and papa must have
          forgotten me. It would never do for me to get locked
          out," she gaily added.</p>
  <p>"Like you were one night before," said Mr. Carlyle,
          significantly.</p>
  <p>He alluded to the night when Barbara was in the grove of
          trees with her unfortunate brother, and Mr. Hare was
          on the point, unconsciously, of locking her out. She
          had given Mr. Carlyle the history; but its
          recollection now called up a smart pain, and a
          change passed over her face.</p>
  <p>"Oh! don't Archibald!" she uttered, in the impulse of the
          moment; "don't recall it." Isabel wondered.</p>
  <p>"Can Peter take me?" continued Barbara.</p>
  <p>"I had better take you," said Mr. Carlyle. "It is
          late."</p>
  <p>Barbara's heart beat at the words; it beat as she put her
          things on; as she said good night to Lady Isabel and
          Miss Carlyle; it beat to throbbing as she went out
          with him and took his arm. All just as it used to
          be—only that he was now the husband of another.
          Only!</p>
  <p>It was a warm lovely June night, not moonlight, but <pb n="243"/> bright with its summer's twilight. They
          went down the park into the road, which they
          crossed, and soon came to a stile. From that stile
          there led a path through the fields which would pass
          the back of Justice Hare's. Barbara stopped at
          it.</p>
  <p>"Would you choose the field way, to-night, Barbara? The
          grass will be damp. And this is the longest
          way."</p>
  <p>"But we shall escape the dust of the road."</p>
  <p>"Oh! very well, if you prefer it. It will not make three
          minutes' difference."</p>
  <p>"He is very anxious to get home to <hi>her!</hi> "
          mentally exclaimed Barbara. "I shall fly out upon
          him presently, or my heart will burst."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle crossed the stile, helped over Barbara, and
          then gave her his arm again. He had taken her
          parasol, he had taken it the last night they had
          walked together; an elegant little parasol, this
          was, of blue silk and white lace, and he did not
          switch the hedges with it. That night was present to
          Barbara now, with all its words and its delusive
          hopes; terribly present to her was their bitter
          ending.</p>
  <p>There are moments in a woman's life when she is betrayed
          into forgetting the ordinary rules of conduct and
          propriety; when she is betrayed into making a scene.
          It may not often occur; perhaps never to a cold,
          secretive nature, where impulse, feeling, and above
          all, temper, are under strict control. Barbara
          Hare's temper was not under strict control. Her
          love, her jealousy, the never-dying pain always
          preying on her heart-strings since the marriage took
          place, her keen sense of the humiliation which had
          come home to her, were all rising fiercely, bubbling
          up with fiery <pb n="244"/> heat. The evening she
          had just passed in their company, their evident
          happiness, the endearments she had seen him lavish
          upon his wife, were working her up to that state of
          nervous excitement when temper, tongue, and
          imagination fly off at a mad tangent. She felt like
          one isolated for ever, shut out from all that could
          make life dear; <hi>they</hi> were the world, she
          was out of it: what was her existence to him? A
          little self-control and Barbara would not have
          uttered words that must remain on her mind hereafter
          like an incubus, dyeing her cheeks red whenever she
          recalled them. It must be remembered too (if
          anything in the shape of excuse can be allowed) that
          she was upon terms of close intimacy with Mr.
          Carlyle. Independent of her own sentiments for him,
          they had been reared in free intercourse, the one
          with the other, almost as brother and sister. Mr.
          Carlyle walked on, utterly unconscious of the storm
          that was raging within her; more than that, he was
          unconscious of having given cause for one; and
          dashed into topics, indifferent and common-place, in
          the most provoking manner.</p>
  <p>"When does the justice begin haymaking, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>There was no reply; Barbara was trying to keep down her
          emotion. Mr. Carlyle tried again:</p>
  <p>"Barbara, I asked you which day your papa cuts his
          hay?"</p>
  <p>Still no reply. Barbara was literally incapable of making
          one. Her throat was working, the muscles of her
          mouth began to twitch, and a convulsive sob, or what
          sounded like it, broke from her. Mr. Carlyle turned
          his head hastily.</p>
  <p>"Barbara! are you ill? What is it?"</p>
  <pb n="245"/>
  <p>On it came, passion, temper, wrongs, and nervousness, all
          boiling over together. She was in strong hysterics.
          Mr. Carlyle half carried, half dragged her to the
          second stile, and placed her against it, his arm
          supporting her; and an old cow and two calves,
          wondering what the disturbance could mean at that
          sober time of night, walked up and stared at
          them.</p>
  <p>Barbara struggled with her emotion, struggled bravely,
          and the sobs and the hysterical symptoms subsided;
          not the excitement or the passion. She put away his
          arm, and stood with her back to the stile, leaning
          against it. Mr. Carlyle felt inclined to fly to the
          pond for water, only he had nothing but his hat to
          get it in.</p>
  <p>"Are you better, Barbara? What can have caused all
          this?</p>
  <p>"What can have caused it!" she burst forth in passionate
          uncontrol. " <hi>You</hi> can ask me that?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was struck dumb; but by some inexplicable
          laws of sympathy, a dim and very unpleasant
          consciousness of the truth began to steal over
          him.</p>
  <p>"I don't understand you, Barbara. If I have offended you
          in any way I am truly sorry."</p>
  <p>"Truly sorry, no doubt! What do you care for me? If I go
          under the sod to-morrow," stamping it with her foot,
          "you have your wife to care for: what am I?"</p>
  <p>"Hush!" he interposed, glancing round, more mindful for
          her than she was for herself.</p>
  <p>"Hush, yes! what is my misery to you? I would rather be
          in my grave, Archibald Carlyle, than endure the life
          I lead. My pain is greater than I know how to
          bear."</p>
  <pb n="246"/>
  <p>"I cannot affect to misunderstand you," he said, feeling
          extremely annoyed and vexed. "But, my dear Barbara,
          I never gave you cause to think that I—that I—cared
          for you more than I did care."</p>
  <p>"Never gave me cause!" she gasped. "When you have been
          coming to our house constantly, almost like my
          shadow; when you gave me this"—dashing open her
          mantle, and holding up the locket to his view; "when
          you have been more intimate with me than a
          brother!"</p>
  <p>"Stay, Barbara. There it is—a brother. I have been
          nothing else: it never occurred to me to be anything
          else," he added, in his straightforward truth.</p>
  <p>"Ay, as a brother, nothing else!" and her voice rose once
          more with her excitement; it seemed that she would
          not long control it. "What cared you for my
          feelings? what recked you that you gained my
          love?"</p>
  <p>"Barbara, hush!" he implored: "do be calm and reasonable.
          If I ever gave you cause to think I regarded you
          with deeper feeling, I can only express to you my
          deep regret, and assure you it was done
          unconsciously."</p>
  <p>She was growing calmer. The passion was fading, leaving
          her face still and white. She lifted it towards Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"If <hi>she</hi> had not come between us, should you have
          loved me?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know. How can I know? Do I not say to you,
          Barbara, that I only thought of you as a friend, as
          a sister? I cannot tell what might have been."</p>
  <p>"I could bear it better, but that it was known," she
          murmured. "All West Lynne had coupled us together in
          their prying gossip, and they have only pity <pb n="247"/> to cast to me now. I would far rather
          you had killed me, Archibald."</p>
  <p>"I can but express to you my deep regret," he repeated.
          "I can only hope you will soon forget it all, Let
          the remembrance of this conversation pass away with
          to-night; let us still be to each other as friends
          —as brother and sister. Believe me," he concluded,
          in a deeper tone, "the confession has not lessened
          you in my estimation."</p>
  <p>He made a movement as though he would get over the stile,
          but Barbara did not stir: tears were silently
          coursing down her pallid face. At that moment there
          was an interruption.</p>
  <p>"Is that you Miss Barbara?"</p>
  <p>Barbara started as if she had been shot. On the other
          side of the stile stood Wilson, their upper maid.
          How long might she have been there? She began to
          explain that Mr. Hare had sent Jasper out, and Mrs.
          Hare had thought it better to wait no longer for the
          man's return, so had despatched her, Wilson, for
          Miss Barbara. Mr. Carlyle got over the stile, and
          handed over Barbara.</p>
  <p>"You need not come any further now," she said to him, in
          a low tone.</p>
  <p>"I shall see you home," was his reply: and he held out
          his arm. Barbara took it.</p>
  <p>They walked on in silence. Arrived at the back gate of
          the Grove, which gave entrance to the
          kitchen-garden, Wilson went forward. Mr. Carlyle
          took both Barbara's hands in his.</p>
  <p>"Good night, Barbara. God bless you."</p>
  <p>She had had time for reflection; and, the excitement
          gone, she saw her outbreak in all its shame and
          folly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Carlyle noticed how subdued and white she looked.</p>
  <p>"I think I have been mad," she groaned. "I must have been
          mad to say what I did. Forget that it was
          uttered."</p>
  <p>"I told you I would."</p>
  <p>"You will not betray me to—to—your wife?" she panted.</p>
  <p>"Barbara!"</p>
  <p>"Thank you. Good night."</p>
  <p>But he still retained her hands. "In a short time,
          Barbara, I trust you will find one more worthy to
          receive your love than I have been."</p>
  <p>"Never," she impulsively answered. "I do not love and
          forget so lightly. In the years to come, in my old
          age, I shall still be nothing but Barbara Hare."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle walked away in a fit of musing. The
          revelation had given him pain (and possibly a little
          flattery), for he was fond of pretty Barbara. Fond
          in his way; not in hers; not with the sort of
          fondness he felt for his wife. He asked his
          conscience whether his manner to her in the past
          days had been a tinge warmer than we bestow upon a
          sister, and he decided that it might have been, but
          that he most certainly had never cast a suspicion to
          the mischief it was doing.</p>
  <p>"I heartily hope she will soon find somebody to her
          liking, and forget me," was his concluding thought.
          "As to living and dying Barbara Hare, that is all
          moonshine; the sentimental rubbish that girls like
          to—"</p>
  <p>"Archibald!"</p>
  <p>He was passing the very last tree in the park, the <pb n="249"/> nearest to his house, and the
          interruption came from a dark form standing under
          it.</p>
  <p>"Is it you, my dearest?"</p>
  <p>"I came out to meet you. Have you not been very
          long?"</p>
  <p>"I think I have," he answered, as he drew his wife to his
          side, and walked on with her. "We met one of the
          servants at the second stile, but I went all the
          way."</p>
  <p>"You have been intimate with the Hares?"</p>
  <p>"Quite so. Cornelia is related to them."</p>
  <p>"Do you think Barbara pretty?"</p>
  <p>"Very."</p>
  <p>"Then—intimate as you were—I wonder you never fell in
          love with her."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed; a very conscious laugh, considering
          the recent interview.</p>
  <p>"Did you, Archibald?"</p>
  <p>The words were spoken in a low tone, almost, or he
          fancied it, a tone of emotion, and he looked at her
          in amazement. "Did I what, Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"You never loved Barbara Hare?"</p>
  <p>"Loved <hi>her!</hi> What is your head running on,
          Isabel? I never loved but one woman: and that one I
          made my wife."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVII. DEATH OR LIFE.</head>
  <p><hi>Another</hi> year came in. Isabel would have been
          altogether happy but for Miss Carlyle: that lady
          still inflicted her presence upon East Lynne, and
          made the bane of its household. She deferred
          outwardly to Lady Isabel as the mistress; but the
          real mistress was herself, Isabel little more than
          an automaton. Her impulses were checked, her wishes
          frustrated, her actions tacitly condemned by the
          imperiously-willed Miss Carlyle: poor Isabel, with
          her refined manners and her timid and sensitive
          temperament, had no chance against the strongminded
          woman, and she was in a state of galling subjection
          in her own house. Mr. Carlyle suspected it not. At
          home but morning and evening, and then generally
          alone with his wife, and becoming gradually more
          absorbed with the cares of his business, which
          increased upon him, he saw not that anything was
          wrong. Once, certain counter-orders of the two
          ladies had clashed, and caused a commotion in the
          household: Miss Carlyle immediately withdrew hers,
          but, in doing so, her peculiarly ungracious manner
          was more ungracious than ever. Isabel had then
          hinted to her husband that they might be happier if
          they lived alone, hinted it with a changing cheek
          and beating heart, as <pb n="251"/> if she were
          committing a wrong upon Miss Carlyle. He proposed to
          his sister that she should return to her own home;
          she turned round and accused him of speaking for
          Isabel. In his truthful, open way, he acknowledged
          the fact, making no secret of it. Miss Carlyle
          bounced off and presented herself before Lady
          Isabel, demanding to know what offence she had
          committed, and why the house was not large enough
          for her to have a corner in it. Isabel, shrinkingly
          tenacious of hurting the feelings, even of an enemy,
          absolutely made a sort of apology, and afterwards
          begged her husband to think no more of what she had
          said. He did not; he was easy and unsuspicious; but
          had he but gained the faintest inkling of the truth,
          he would not have lost a moment in emancipating his
          wife from the thraldom of Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>Not a day passed but Miss Carlyle, by dint of hints and
          innuendoes, contrived to impress upon Lady Isabel
          the unfortunate blow to his own interests that Mr.
          Carlyle's marriage had been, the ruinous expense she
          had entailed upon the family. It struck a complete
          chill to Isabel's heart, and she became painfully
          imbued with the incubus she must be to Mr. Carlyle—
          so far as his pocket was concerned. Lord Mount
          Severn, with his little son, had paid them a short
          visit at Christmas, and Isabel had asked him,
          apparently with unconcern, whether Mr. Carlyle had
          put himself very much out of the way to marry her;
          whether it had entailed on him an expense and a
          style of living he would not otherwise have deemed
          himself justified in affording. Lord Mount Severn's
          reply was an unfortunate one: he said, his opinion
          was that it had, and that Isabel ought to feel
          grateful to him for his generosity. She sighed as
          she listened, and from thenceforth determined <pb n="252"/> to <hi>put up</hi> with Miss Carlyle.
          That lady contributed a liberal share to the
          maintenance of the household, and <hi>would</hi> do
          it, quite as much as would have kept up her
          establishment at home. She was not at East Lynne to
          save her own pocket, and there lay a greater
          difficulty in getting rid of her. Whether she spent
          her money at East Lynne or not, it would come to the
          same in the end, for it was known that all she had
          would go to Archibald.</p>
  <p>More timid and sensitive by nature than many would
          believe or can imagine, reared in seclusion more
          simply and quietly than falls to the general lot of
          peers' daughters, and completely inexperienced,
          Isabel was unfit to battle with the world, totally
          unfit to battle with Miss Carlyle. The penniless
          state in which she was left at her father's death;
          the want of a home, save that accorded her at Castle
          Marling, even the hundred poundnote left in her hand
          by Mr. Carlyle, all had imbued her with a deep
          consciousness of humiliation; and, far from
          rebelling at or despising the small establishment
          (comparatively speaking) provided for her by Mr.
          Carlyle, she felt thankful to him for it. But to be
          told continually that this was more than he could
          afford, that she was in fact a blight upon his
          prospects, was enough to turn her heart to
          bitterness. Oh, that she had had the courage to
          speak out openly to her husband! that he might, by a
          single word of earnest love and assurance, have
          taken the weight from her heart, and rejoiced it
          with the truth—that all these miserable complaints
          were but the phantoms of his narrow-minded sister.
          But Isabel never did: when Miss Corny lapsed into
          her grumbling mood, she would <pb n="253"/> hear in
          silence, or gently bend her aching forehead in her
          hands, never retorting.</p>
  <p>One day, it was in the month of February, after a
          tolerably long explosion of wrath on Miss Corny's
          part, not directed against Isabel, but at something
          which had gone wrong amongst the servants, silence
          supervened. Isabel, who was sitting listless and
          dispirited, suddenly broke it, speaking more to
          herself than to Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I wish evening was come!"</p>
  <p>"Why do you wish that?"</p>
  <p>"Because Archibald would be at home."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle gave an unsatisfactory grunt. "You seem
          tired, Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"I am very tired."</p>
  <p>"I don't wonder at it. I should be tired to death if I
          sat doing nothing all day. Indeed, I think I should
          soon drop into my grave."</p>
  <p>"There's nothing to do," returned Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"There's always something to do when people like to look
          for it. You might help me with these new table
          napkins, rather than do nothing."</p>
  <p>"I make table napkins!" exclaimed Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"You might do a worse thing, ma'am," snapped Miss
          Corny.</p>
  <p>"I don't understand that sort of work," said Isabel,
          gently.</p>
  <p>"Neither does anybody else till they try. For my part I'd
          rather set on and make or mend shoes, than I'd sit
          with my hands before me. It's a sinful waste of
          time."</p>
  <p>"I never feel very well now," answered poor Isabel, in an
          apologetic tone. "I am not equal to exertion."</p>
  <pb n="254"/>
  <p>"Then I'd go out for a drive, and take the air. Moping
          in-doors all day does invalids no good."</p>
  <p>"But, since the ponies started last week and alarmed me,
          Archibald will not allow me to go out, unless he
          drives me himself."</p>
  <p>"There's nothing the matter with John's driving,"
          returned Miss Corny, in her spirit of contradiction.
          "And in the matter of experience he has had quite as
          much as your husband, ma'am."</p>
  <p>"John was driving when the ponies took fright."</p>
  <p>"If ponies take fright once, it's no reason that they
          should a second time. Ring the bell, and order John
          to bring the carriage round: it is what I should
          advise."</p>
  <p>Isabel shook her head decisively. "No: Archibald bade me
          not go out without him, unless it was in the close
          carriage. He is so careful of me just now; and he
          knows that I should not be alarmed with him, if the
          ponies did start, like I should with a servant."</p>
  <p>"It occurs to me that you have grown a little fanciful of
          late, Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"I suppose I have," was the meek answer. "I shall be
          better when baby is born: and I shall never feel at
          a loss then, I shall have plenty to do."</p>
  <p>"So will most of us I expect," returned Miss Corny, with
          a groan. "Why, what on earth—why, if I don't believe
          here's Archibald! What brings him home at this time
          of day?"</p>
  <p>"Archibald!" Out she flew in her glad surprise, meeting
          him in the hall, and falling upon him in her
          delight. "Oh, Archibald, my darling, it is as if the
          sun had shone! What have you come home for?"</p>
  <pb n="255"/>
  <p>"To drive you out, love," he whispered, as he took her
          back with him and rang the bell.</p>
  <p>"You never told me this morning."</p>
  <p>"Because I was not sure of being able to come. Peter, let
          the pony-carriage be brought round without delay. I
          am waiting for it."</p>
  <p>"Why, where are you going with the pony-carriage?"
          exclaimed Miss Carlyle, as Isabel left the room to
          dress herself.</p>
  <p>"Only for a drive."</p>
  <p>"A drive!" repeated Miss Corny, looking at him in
          bewilderment.</p>
  <p>"To take Isabel for one. I shall not trust her to John
          again, yet awhile."</p>
  <p>" <hi>That's</hi> the way to get on with your business!"
          retorted Miss Corny, when she could find temper to
          speak. "Deserting the office in the middle of the
          day!"</p>
  <p>"Isabel's health is of more consequence, just now, than
          business," he returned, good humouredly. "And you
          really speak, Cornelia, as if I had neither Dill to
          replace me, nor plenty of clerks under him."</p>
  <p>"John is a better driver than you are."</p>
  <p>"He is as good a one. But that is not the question."</p>
  <p>Isabel came down, looking radiant, all her listlessness
          gone. Mr. Carlyle placed her in the carriage, and
          drove away, Miss Corny gazing after them with an
          expression of face enough to turn a whole dairy of
          milk sour.</p>
  <p>There were many such little episodes as these, so you
          need not wonder that Isabel was not altogether
          happy. But never, before Mr. Carlyle, was the lady's
          temper vented upon her; plenty fell to his own share
          when he <pb n="256"/> and his sister were alone; and
          he had been so accustomed to the sort of thing all
          his life, had got so used to it, that it made no
          impression: he never dreamt that Isabel also
          received her portion.</p>
  <p>It was a morning early in April. Joyce sat, in its grey
          dawn, over a large fire in the dressing-room of Lady
          Isabel Carlyle, her hands clasped to pain, and the
          tears coursing down her cheeks. Joyce was
          frightened: she had had some experience in illness;
          but illness of this nature she had never witnessed,
          and she was fervently hoping never to witness it
          again. In the adjoining room was Lady Isabel, lying
          between life and death.</p>
  <p>The door from the corridor softly opened, and Miss
          Carlyle entered. She had probably never walked with
          so gentle a step in all her life, and she had a
          thick wadded mantle over her head and ears. She sat
          down in a chair quite meekly, and Joyce saw that her
          face looked grey as the early morning.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," whispered she, "is there danger?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, ma'am, I trust not! But it's hard to witness, and it
          must be awful to bear."</p>
  <p>"It is our common curse, Joyce. You and I may
          congratulate ourselves that we have not chosen to
          encounter it. Joyce," she added, after a pause, "I
          trust there's no danger: I should not like her to
          die."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle spoke in a low, dread tone. Was she fearing
          that if her poor young sister-in-law did die, a
          weight would rest on her conscience for all time?—a
          heavy, ever-present weight, whispering that she
          might have rendered her short year of marriage more
          happy, had she chosen; and that she had not so
          chosen, but had deliberately steeled every crevice
          of her heart against <pb n="257"/> her? Very
          probably: she looked anxious and apprehensive in the
          dusky twilight.</p>
  <p>"If there's danger, Joyce—"</p>
  <p>"Why do you think there is danger, ma'am?" interrupted
          Joyce. "Are other people not as ill as this?"</p>
  <p>"It is to be hoped they are not," rejoined Miss Carlyle.
          "And why is the express gone to Lynneborough for Dr.
          Martin?"</p>
  <p>Up started Joyce, awestruck. "An express for Dr. Martin!
          Oh, ma'am! Who sent it? When did it go?"</p>
  <p>"All I know is, that it's gone. Mr. Wainwright went to
          your master, and he came out of his room and sent
          John galloping to the telegraph-office at West
          Lynne: where could your ears have been, not to hear
          the horse tearing off? <hi>I</hi> heard it, I know
          that, and a nice fright it put me in. I went to Mr.
          Carlyle's room to ask what was amiss, and he said he
          did not know himself; nothing, he hoped. And then he
          shut his door again in my face, instead of stopping
          to speak to me as any other Christian would."</p>
  <p>Joyce did not answer: she was faint with apprehension;
          and there was a silence, broken only by the sounds
          from the next room. Miss Carlyle rose, and a
          fanciful person might have thought she was
          shivering.</p>
  <p>"I can't stand this, Joyce; I shall go. If they want
          coffee, or anything, it can be sent in. Ask."</p>
  <p>"I will presently; in a few minutes," answered Joyce,
          with a real shiver. "You are not going in, are you,
          ma'am?" she uttered in apprehension, as Miss Carlyle
          began to steal on tiptoe to the inner door, and
          Joyce had a lively consciousness that her sight
          would <pb n="258"/> not be an agreeable one to Lady
          Isabel. "They want the room free: they sent me
          out."</p>
  <p>"No," answered Miss Corny. "I could do no good; and
          those, who cannot, are better away."</p>
  <p>"Just what Mr. Wainwright said, when he dismissed me,"
          murmured Joyce. And Miss Carlyle finally passed into
          the corridor and withdrew.</p>
  <p>Joyce sat on: the time seemed to her interminable. And
          then she heard the arrival of Dr. Martin; heard him
          go into the next room. By-and-by Mr. Wainwright came
          out of it, into the room where Joyce was sitting.
          Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth, and
          before she could bring out the ominous words, "Is
          there danger?" he had passed through it.</p>
  <p>Mr. Wainwright was on his way to the apartment where he
          expected to find Mr. Carlyle. The latter was pacing
          it: he had so paced it all the night. His pale face
          flushed as the surgeon entered.</p>
  <p>"You have little mercy on my suspense, Wainwright. Dr.
          Martin has been here these twenty minutes. What does
          he say?"</p>
  <p>"Well, he cannot say any more than I did. The symptoms
          are critical, but he hopes she will do well. There's
          nothing for it but patience."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle resumed his weary walk.</p>
  <p>"I come now to suggest that you should send for Little.
          In these protracted cases—"</p>
  <p>The speech was interrupted by a cry from Mr. Carlyle,
          half horror, half despair. For the Reverend Mr.
          Little was the incumbent of St. Jude's, and his
          apprehensions had flown—he hardly knew to what they
          had not flown.</p>
  <p>"Not for your wife?" hastily rejoined the surgeon. "I
          spoke for the child. Should it not live, it may be
            <pb n="259"/> satisfactory to you and Lady Isabel
          to know that it was baptised."</p>
  <p>"I thank you, I thank you," said Mr. Carlyle, grasping
          his hand in his inexpressible relief. "Little shall
          be sent for."</p>
  <p>"You jumped to the conclusion that your wife's soul was
          flitting. Please God, she may yet live to bear you
          other children, if this one should die."</p>
  <p>"Please God!" was the inward aspiration of Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Carlyle," added the surgeon, in a musing sort of tone,
          as he laid his hand on Mr. Carlyle's shoulder, which
          his own head scarcely reached, "I am sometimes at
          death-beds where the clergyman is sent for, in this
          desperate need, to the fleeting spirit: and I am
          tempted to ask myself what good another man, priest
          though he be, can do at the twelfth hour, where the
          accounts have not been made up previously?"</p>
  <p>It was hard upon mid-day. The Reverend Mr. Little, Mr.
          Carlyle, and Miss Carlyle were gathered in the
          dressing-room, round a table on which stood a rich
          china bowl, containing water for the baptism. Joyce,
          her pale face working with emotion, came into the
          room, carrying what looked like a bundle of flannel.
          Little cared Mr. Carlyle for that bundle, in
          comparison with his care for his wife.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," he whispered, "is all well still?"</p>
  <p>"I believe so, sir."</p>
  <p>The service commenced. The clergyman took the child.
          "What name?" he asked.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle had never thought about the name. But he
          replied pretty promptly,</p>
  <pb n="260"/>
  <p>"William." For he knew it was a name revered and loved by
          Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>The minister dipped his fingers in the water. Joyce
          interrupted, in much confusion, looking at her
          master.</p>
  <p>"It is a little girl, sir. I beg your pardon, I'm sure I
          thought I had said so: but I am flurried as I never
          was before."</p>
  <p>There was a pause, and then the minister spoke again.
          "Name this child."</p>
  <p>"Isabel Lucy," said Mr. Carlyle. Upon which a strange
          sort of resentful sniff was heard from Miss Corny.
          She had probably thought to hear him mention her
          own; but he had named it after his wife and his
          mother.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was not allowed to see his wife until the
          evening. His eyelashes glistened as he looked down
          at her. She detected his emotion, and a faint smile
          parted her lips.</p>
  <p>"I fear I bore it badly, Archibald; but let us be
          thankful that it is over. How thankful, none can
          know, save those who have gone through it."</p>
  <p>"I think they can," he murmured. "I never knew what
          thankfulness was until this day."</p>
  <p>"That the baby is safe?"</p>
  <p>"That <hi>you</hi> are safe, my darling; safe and spared
          to me. Isabel," he whispered, hiding his face upon
          hers, "I never until to-day knew what prayer was—the
          prayer of a heart in its sore need."</p>
  <p>"Have you written to Lord Mount Severn?" she asked, after
          a while.</p>
  <p>"This afternoon," he replied.</p>
  <p>"Why did you give baby my name—Isabel?"</p>
  <pb n="261"/>
  <p>"Do you think I could have given it a prettier one? I
          don't."</p>
  <p>"Why do you not bring a chair and sit down by me?"</p>
  <p>He smiled and shook his head. "I wish I might. But they
          limited my stay with you to four minutes; and
          Wainwright has posted himself outside the door with
          his watch in his hand."</p>
  <p>Quite true. There stood the careful surgeon: and the
          short interview was over almost as soon as it had
          begun.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVIII. WILSON'S TONGUE.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> baby lived, and appeared likely to live, and
          of course the next thing was to look out for a maid
          for it. Isabel did not get strong very quickly;
          fever and weakness had a struggle with each other
          and with her. One day when she was dressed and
          sitting in her easy-chair, Miss Carlyle entered.</p>
  <p>"Of all the servants in the neighbourhood, who should you
          suppose is come up after the place of nurse?" she
          said to Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Indeed I cannot guess."</p>
  <p>"Why, Wilson, Mrs. Hare's maid. Three years and five
          months she has been with them, and now leaves in
          consequence of a quarrel with Barbara. Will you see
          her?"</p>
  <p>"Is she likely to suit? Is she a good servant?"</p>
  <p>"She's not a bad servant, as servants go," responded Miss
          Carlyle. "She's steady and respectable; but she has
          got a tongue as long as from here to
          Lynneborough."</p>
  <p>"That won't hurt the baby," said Lady Isabel. "But if she
          has lived as lady's maid, she probably does not
          understand the care of infants."</p>
  <p>"Yes, she does. She was upper nurse at Squire <pb n="263"/> Pinner's, before going to Mrs. Hare's. She lived
          there five years."</p>
  <p>"I will see her," said Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle left the room to send the servant in, but
          came back first alone.</p>
  <p>"Mind, Lady Isabel, don't you engage her. If she is
          likely to suit you, let her come again for the
          answer, and meanwhile I will go down to Mrs. Hare's
          and learn the ins and outs of her leaving. It is all
          very plausible for her to put it upon Barbara, but
          that is only one side of the question. Before
          engaging her, it may be well to hear the other."</p>
  <p>Of course this was but right. Isabel acquiesced, and the
          servant was introduced: a tall, pleasant-looking
          woman, with black eyes. Lady Isabel inquired why she
          was leaving Mrs. Hare's.</p>
  <p>"My lady, it is through Miss Barbara's temper.
          Latterly—oh, for this year past—nothing has pleased
          her; she has grown nearly as imperious as the
          justice himself. I have threatened many times to
          leave, and last evening we came to another outbreak,
          and I left this morning."</p>
  <p>"Left entirely?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, my lady. Miss Barbara provoked me so, that I said
          last night, I would leave as soon as breakfast was
          over. And I did so. I should be very glad to take
          your situation, my lady, if you would please to try
          me."</p>
  <p>"You have been the upper maid at Mrs. Hare's?"</p>
  <p>"Oh yes, my lady."</p>
  <p>"Then possibly this situation might not suit you so well
          as you imagine. Joyce is the upper servant here, and
          you would, in a manner, be under her. I have <pb n="264"/> great confidence in Joyce; and in case
          of my illness or absence, Joyce would superintend
          the nursery."</p>
  <p>"I should not mind that," was the applicant's answer. "We
          all like Joyce, my lady."</p>
  <p>A few more questions, and then the girl was told to come
          again in the evening for her answer. Miss Carlyle
          went to the Grove for the "ins and outs" of the
          affair, when Mrs. Hare frankly stated that she had
          nothing to urge against Wilson, save her hasty
          manner of leaving, of which she believed the chief
          blame to be due to Barbara. Wilson was therefore
          engaged, and was to enter upon her new service the
          following morning.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon succeeding to it, Isabel was lying on
          the sofa in her bedroom, asleep, as was supposed. In
          point of fact, she was in that state, half sleep,
          half wakeful delirium, which those who suffer from
          weakness and fever know only too well. Suddenly she
          was aroused from it by hearing her own name
          mentioned in the adjoining room, where sat Joyce and
          Wilson, the latter holding the sleeping infant on
          her knee, the former sewing, the door between the
          rooms being ajar.</p>
  <p>"How ill she looks," observed Wilson.</p>
  <p>"Who?" asked Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Her ladyship. She looks as if she'd never get over
          it."</p>
  <p>"She is getting over it quickly, now," returned Joyce.
          "If you had seen her a week ago, you would not say
          she was looking ill now—speaking in comparison."</p>
  <p>"My goodness! would not somebody's ropes be up again if
          anything should happen?"</p>
  <pb n="265"/>
  <p>"Nonsense!" crossly returned Joyce.</p>
  <p>"You may cry out 'nonsense' for ever, Joyce, but they
          would," went on Wilson. "And she would snap him up,
          to a dead certainty; she'd never let him escape her
          a second time. She is as much in love with him as
          she ever was."</p>
  <p>"It was all talk and fancy," said Joyce. "West Lynne must
          be busy. Mr. Carlyle never cared for her."</p>
  <p>"That's more than you know. I have seen a little, Joyce;
          I have seen him kiss her."</p>
  <p>"A pack of rubbish!" remarked Joyce. "That tells
          nothing."</p>
  <p>"I don't say it does: he gave her that locket and chain
          she wears."</p>
  <p>"Who wears?" retorted Joyce, determined not graciously to
          countenance the subject. "I don't want to hear
          anything about it."</p>
  <p>"'Who,' now! Why, Miss Barbara. She has hardly had it off
          her neck since: my belief is, she wears it in her
          sleep."</p>
  <p>"More simpleton she!" echoed Joyce.</p>
  <p>"The night before he left West Lynne to marry Lady
          Isabel—and didn't the news come upon us like a
          thunderclap!—Miss Barbara had been at Miss
          Carlyle's, and he brought her home. A lovely night
          it was, the moon rising, and nearly as light as day.
          He somehow broke her parasol in coming home, and
          when they got to our gate there was a love
          scene."</p>
  <p>"Were you a third in it?" sarcastically demanded
          Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Yes—without meaning to be. That skinflint old justice
          won't allow followers in-doors, and there's no <pb n="266"/> seeing anybody on the sly in that
          conspicuous back kitchen-garden, where there's
          nothing higher than a cauliflower, so the only
          chance, we have, is to get half an hour's chat
          amidst the grove trees in the front, if a friend
          comes up. I was expecting somebody that evening—a
          horrid faithless fellow he turned out, and went,
          three months after, and married the barmaid at the
          Buck's Head!—and I was in the trees waiting for him.
          Up came Mr. Carlyle and Miss Barbara. She wanted him
          to go in, but he would not, and they stood there.
          Something was said about the locket, and about his
          giving her a piece of his hair to put in it: I could
          not catch the words distinctly, and I did not dare
          to stir nearer, for fear of their hearing me. It was
          a regular love scene; I could hear enough for that.
          If ever anybody thought to be Mrs. Carlyle, Barbara
          Hare did, that night."</p>
  <p>"Why, you great gaby! You have just said it was the night
          before he went to be married!"</p>
  <p>"I don't care; she did. After he was gone, I saw her lift
          up her hands and her face in ecstasy, and say he
          could never know how much she loved him until she
          was his wife. Be you very sure, Joyce, many a love
          passage had passed between them two: but I suppose
          when my lady was thrown in his way he couldn't
          resist her rank and her beauty, and the old love was
          cast over. It is in the nature of man to be fickle,
          especially those that can boast of their own good
          looks, like Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle's not fickle."</p>
  <p>"I can tell you some more yet. Two or three days after
          that, Miss Corny came up to our house with the news
          of his marriage. I was in mistress's bedroom, <pb n="267"/> and they were in the room underneath,
          the windows open, and I heard Miss Corny tell the
          tale, for I was leaning out. Up came Miss Barbara
          upon an excuse and flew into her room, and I went
          into the corridor. A few moments, and I heard a
          noise; it was a sort of wail, or groan, and I opened
          the door softly, fearing she might be fainting.
          Joyce, if my heart never ached for anybody before,
          it ached then. She was lying on the floor, her hands
          writhed together, and her poor face all white, like
          one in mortal agony. I'd have given a quarter's
          wages to be able to say a word of comfort to her;
          but I didn't dare interfere with such sorrow as
          that. I came out again and shut the door without her
          seeing me."</p>
  <p>"How thoroughly stupid she must have been!" uttered
          Joyce; "to go caring for one who did not care for
          her."</p>
  <p>"I tell you, Joyce, you don't know that he did not care.
          You are as obstinate as the justice! And I wish to
          goodness you wouldn't interrupt me. They came up
          here to pay the wedding visit, master, mistress, and
          she; came in state in the grand chariot, with the
          coach man and Jasper; if you have got any memory at
          all, you can't fail to recollect it. Miss Barbara
          remained behind at East Lynne to spend the rest of
          the day."</p>
  <p>"I remember it."</p>
  <p>"I was sent to attend her home in the evening, Jasper
          being out. I came the field way; for the dust by the
          road was enough to smother one, and at the last
          stile but one, what do you think I came upon?"</p>
  <p>Joyce lifted her eyes. "A snake, perhaps."</p>
  <p>"I came upon Miss Barbara and Mr. Carlyle. What had
          passed, nobody knows but themselves. She was <pb n="268"/> leaning her back against the stile,
          crying; sobs breaking from her, like one might
          expect to hear from a breaking heart. It seemed as
          if she had been reproaching him, as if some
          explanation had passed, and I heard him say that
          from henceforth they could only be brother and
          sister. I spoke soon, for fear they should see me,
          and Mr. Carlyle got over the stile. Miss Barbara
          said to him that he need not come any farther, but
          he just held out his arm and came with her to our
          back gate. I went on then to open the door, and I
          saw him with his head bent down to her, and her two
          hands held in his. We don't know how it was between
          them, I tell you."</p>
  <p>"At any rate she is a downright fool to suffer herself to
          love him still!" uttered Joyce, indignantly.</p>
  <p>"So she is, but she does do it. She'll often steal out to
          the gate about the time she knows he'll be passing,
          and watch him by, not letting him see her. It is
          nothing but her unhappiness, her jealousy of Lady
          Isabel, that makes her cross: I assure you, Joyce,
          in this past year she has so changed that she's not
          like the same person. If Mr. Carlyle should ever get
          tired of my lady, and—"</p>
  <p>"Wilson!" harshly interrupted Joyce. "Have the goodness
          to recollect yourself."</p>
  <p>"What have I said now? Nothing but truth. Men are
          shamefully fickle, husbands worse than sweethearts,
          and I'm sure I'm not thinking of anything wrong. But
          to go back to the argument that we began with—I say
          that if anything happened to my lady, Miss Barbara,
          as sure as fate, would step into her shoes."</p>
  <p>"Nothing is going to happen to her," returned Joyce, with
          composure.</p>
  <pb n="269"/>
  <p>"I hope it is not, now or later—for the sake of this dear
          little innocent thing upon my lap," went on the
          undaunted Wilson. "She would not make a very kind
          stepmother, for it is certain that where the first
          wife has been hated, her children won't be loved.
          She would turn Mr. Carlyle against them—"</p>
  <p>"I tell you what it is, Wilson," interrupted Joyce, in a
          firm, unmistakable tone, "if you think to pursue
          these sort of topics at East Lynne, I shall inform
          my lady that you are unsuitable for the
          situation."</p>
  <p>"I dare say!"</p>
  <p>"And you know that when I make up my mind to a thing, I
          do it," continued Joyce. "Miss Carlyle may well say
          you have the longest tongue in West Lynne; but you
          might have the grace to know that this subject is
          one more unsuitable to it than another, whether you
          are eating Mr. Hare's bread, or whether you are
          eating Mr. Carlyle's. Another word, Wilson; it
          appears to me that you have carried on a prying
          system in Mrs. Hare's house; do not attempt such a
          thing in this."</p>
  <p>"You were always one of the straight-laced sort, Joyce,"
          cried Wilson, laughing good-humouredly. "But now
          that I have had my say out, I shall stop; and you
          need not fear I should be such a simpleton as to go
          prattling of this kind of thing to the
          servants."</p>
  <p>Now just fancy this conversation penetrating to Lady
          Isabel! She heard it, every word. It is all very
          well to oppose the argument, "Who attends to the
          gossip of servants?" Let me tell you it depends upon
          what the subject may be, whether the gossip is
          attended to, or not. It might not, and indeed would
          not, have made so great an impression upon her had
          she been in <pb n="270"/> strong health, but she was
          weak, feverish, in a state of partial delirium; and
          she hastily took up the idea that Archibald Carlyle
          had never loved her, that he had admired her and
          made her his wife in his ambition, but that his
          heart had been given to Barbara Hare.</p>
  <p>A pretty state of excitement she worked herself into as
          she lay there; jealousy and fever, ay, and love too,
          playing pranks with her brain. It was near the
          dinner hour, and when Mr. Carlyle entered, he was
          startled to see her: her pallid cheeks were burning
          with a red hectic, and her eyes glistened with
          fever.</p>
  <p>"Isabel! you are worse!" he uttered, approaching her with
          a quick step.</p>
  <p>She partially rose from the sofa, and clasped hold of him
          in her emotion. "Oh, Archibald! Archibald!" she
          uttered, "don't marry her! I could not rest in my
          grave."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, in his puzzled astonishment, believed her to
          be labouring under some temporary hallucination, the
          result of weakness. He set himself to soothe her,
          but it seemed that she could not be soothed. She
          burst into a storm of tears, and began again: wild
          words.</p>
  <p>"She would ill-treat my child; she would draw your love
          from it, and from my memory. Archibald, you must not
          marry her."</p>
  <p>"You must be speaking from the influence of a dream,
          Isabel," he soothingly said; "you have been asleep,
          and are not yet awake. Be still, and recollection
          will return to you. There, love; rest upon me."</p>
  <p>"To think of her as your wife brings pain enough to kill
          me," she continued to reiterate. "Promise me that
          you will not marry her: Archibald, promise it!"</p>
  <pb n="271"/>
  <p>"I will promise you anything in reason," he replied,
          bewildered with her words, "but I do not know what
          you mean. There is no possibility of my marrying any
          one, Isabel: you are my wife."</p>
  <p>"But if I die? I may; you know I may; and many think I
          shall—do not let her usurp my place."</p>
  <p>"Indeed she shall not—whoever you may be talking of. What
          have you been dreaming? Who is it that is troubling
          your mind?"</p>
  <p>"Archibald, do you need to ask? Did you love no one
          before you married me? Perhaps you have loved her
          since—perhaps you love her still?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle began to discern "method in her madness." He
          changed his cheering tone to one of grave
          earnestness. "Of whom do you speak, Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"Of Barbara Hare."</p>
  <p>He knitted his brow; he was both annoyed and vexed.
          Whatever had put this bygone nonsense into his
          wife's head? He quitted the sofa, where he had been
          supporting her, and stood upright before her, calm,
          dignified, almost solemn in his seriousness.</p>
  <p>"Isabel, what notion you can possibly have picked up
          about myself and Barbara Hare, I am unable to
          conceive. I never loved Barbara Hare; I never
          entertained the faintest shadow of love for her;
          either before my marriage or since. You must tell me
          what has given rise to this idea in your mind."</p>
  <p>"But she loved you."</p>
  <p>A moment's hesitation; for of course Mr. Carlyle was
          conscious she had; but, taking all the circumstances
          into consideration, more especially how he learnt
          the fact, he could not in honour acknowledge it even
          to his wife. "If it was so, Isabel, she was more <pb n="272"/> reprehensibly foolish than I should have
          given Barbara's good sense credit for: a woman may
          almost as well lose herself, as suffer herself to
          love, unsought. If she did give her love to me, I
          can only say I was entirely unconscious of it.
          Believe me, you have as much cause to be jealous of
          Cornelia, as you have of Barbara Hare."</p>
  <p>Isabel sighed: it was a sigh of relief, and her breath
          grew calmer. She felt inexpressibly reassured. Mr.
          Carlyle bent his head, and spoke in a tender, though
          a pained tone.</p>
  <p>"I had not thought that the past year was quite thrown
          away. What proof can a man give, of true and earnest
          love, that I have not given to you?"</p>
  <p>She looked up, her eyelashes wet with contrition, took
          his hand and held it between hers. "Don't be angry
          with me, Archibald: the trouble and the doubt would
          not have arisen had I cared for you less."</p>
  <p>He smiled again, his own fond smile, and bent lower. "And
          now tell me what put this into your brain?"</p>
  <p>An impulse rose within her that she would tell him all,
          the few words dropped by Susan and Joyce twelve
          months before, the conversation she had just
          overheard; but, in that moment of renewed confidence
          it appeared to her that she must have been very
          foolish to attach importance to it—that a sort of
          humiliation, in listening to the converse, of
          servants, was reflected on her; and she remained
          silent.</p>
  <p>"Has any one been striving to bias your mind against me?"
          he resumed.</p>
  <p>"Archibald! no. Would any one dare to do it?"</p>
  <p>"Then did you dream?—and could not forget it on
          awaking?"</p>
  <pb n="273"/>
  <p>"I do sometimes dream strange things, especially in my
          feverish afternoon sleeps. I think I am a little
          delirious at times, Archibald, and do not know what
          is real, and what fancy."</p>
  <p>The answer, while expressing correctly her physical
          state, was an evasive one, but not evasively did it
          fall upon the ear of Mr. Carlyle. It presented to
          him the only probable solution of the enigma, and he
          never questioned it.</p>
  <p>"Don't have any more of these dreams, if you can help
          it," he said. "Regard them for what they are
          —illusions—neither pleasant for you, nor fair to me.
          I am bound to you by fond ties as well as by legal
          ones, remember, Isabel; and it is out of Barbara
          Hare's power to step between us."</p>
  <p>There never was a passion in this world, there never will
          be one, so fantastic, so delusive, so powerful as
          jealousy. Mr. Carlyle dismissed the episode from his
          thoughts; he believed his wife's emotion to have
          arisen simply from a feverish dream, and never
          supposed but that, with the dream, its recollection
          would pass away from her. Not so. Implicitly relying
          upon her husband's words at the moment, feeling
          quite ashamed at her own suspicion, Lady Isabel
          afterwards suffered the unhappy fear to regain its
          influence: the ill-starred revelations of Wilson
          reasserted their power, over-mastering the denial of
          Mr. Carlyle. Shakspeare calls jealousy yellow and
          green: I think it may be called black and white; for
          it most assuredly views white as black, and black as
          white. The most fanciful surmises wear the aspect of
          truth, the greatest improbabilities appear as
          consistent realities. Isabel said not another word
          to her husband; and the feeling— <pb n="274"/> you
          will understand this, if you have ever been foolish
          enough to sun yourself in its delights—only caused
          her to grow more attached to him, to be more eager
          for his love. But certain it is, that Barbara Hare
          dwelt on her heart like an incubus.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIX. CAPTAIN THORN AT WEST LYNNE.</head>
  <p>" <hi>Barbara</hi> , how fine the day seems!"</p>
  <p>"It is a beautiful day, mamma."</p>
  <p>"I think I should be all the better for going out."</p>
  <p>"I am sure you would, mamma," was Barbara's answer. "If
          you went out more, you would find the benefit: every
          fine day you ought to do so."</p>
  <p>"But I have not spirits for it, dear," sighed Mrs. Hare.
          "The first bright days of spring, the first warm
          days of summer, always have an exhilarating effect
          upon me. I think I must go out to-day. There's your
          papa in the garden: ask him if it will be
          convenient."</p>
  <p>Barbara was darting off, but arrested her steps for a
          moment. "Mamma, you have been talking these three
          weeks of buying the new dresses and other things
          that we require: why not do so to-day?"</p>
  <p>"Well—I don't know," hesitated Mrs. Hare, in the
          irresolution natural to her.</p>
  <p>"Yes, yes, you will not find a better opportunity." And
          away went Barbara.</p>
  <p>Justice Hare was in his front garden, imperiously
          pointing out to his servant, Benjamin, something
          which had not been done according to his directions.
          Benjamin fulfilled the duties of coachman and groom
          at the <pb n="276"/> Grove, filling up his spare
          time with gardening. He was a married man, and slept
          at home, though he took his meals in the house;
          coming to it early, and going away late. The justice
          was in his dressing-gown and wig, and was working
          himself into a passion when Barbara approached. She
          was the only one of the three children not afraid of
          her father: Barbara stood in awe of him, but not so
          utterly as the others.</p>
  <p>"Papa."</p>
  <p>"What do you want?" said the justice, turning round his
          portly person.</p>
  <p>"Mamma thinks that it would do her good to go out this
          fine day. Can we have the carriage?"</p>
  <p>The justice paused before he answered, and looked up at
          the sky. "Where does she want to be off to?"</p>
  <p>"We wish to do some shopping, please papa. Only in West
          Lynne," hastily added Barbara, seeing a cloud rise
          on the paternal countenance. "Not at
          Lynneborough."</p>
  <p>"And your mamma thinks I am going to drive her!" cried
          Justice Hare. "I'd see the shops further, first. The
          last time you and she went into one, you kept me
          waiting an hour and a half."</p>
  <p>"Benjamin can drive us, papa."</p>
  <p>Mr. Hare strode pompously across the grass to the
          dining-room window, threw it up, and addressed his
          wife. Barbara drew close, and stood timidly at his
          side.</p>
  <p>"Do you say you want to go shopping to-day, Anne?"</p>
  <p>"Not particularly to-day," was the meek answer, meekly
          delivered; "any day will do for it. Did you think of
          using the carriage yourself?"</p>
  <pb n="277"/>
  <p>"I don't know," replied the justice. The fact is, he had
          not thought about it at all; but he liked every
          scheme, every movement to be proposed by himself, to
          be regulated by his own will.</p>
  <p>"The day is so fine that I think I should like to take
          advantage of it," said Mrs. Hare. "And Barbara must
          have her summer dresses bought."</p>
  <p>"She's always having dresses bought," growled the
          justice.</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa! I—"</p>
  <p>"Silence, young lady. You have twice as many as you
          need."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps, Richard, I might manage to walk in and back,
          without being much fatigued, if you cannot spare me
          the carriage," said Mrs. Hare, gently.</p>
  <p>"And have you laid up for a week! What next? The idea of
          your walking into West Lynne and back! that would be
          a piece of folly."</p>
  <p>The justice shut down the window, and strode back to
          Benjamin, leaving Mrs. Hare and Barbara at an
          uncertainty: were they to go, or were they not?
          Barbara went in-doors to her mother.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, dear, I wonder where your papa was thinking of
          going in the carriage?"</p>
  <p>"I don't believe he was going anywhere," replied
          independent Miss Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Oh, child!"</p>
  <p>"Well, I don't. Only he always must oppose everybody.
          Mamma, I do think you might walk in, and we could
          come back in one of Coke's flys."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare shook her head. "I have no doubt I could walk
          quite well one way, Barbara: but I should not think
          of doing so, unless your papa approved."</p>
  <pb n="278"/>
  <p>Barbara was looking from the window. She saw Benjamin
          gather up his garden tools and put them away. He
          then crossed to the narrow side-path which led down
          by the house to the back, where the stables were
          situated. Barbara ran through the hall and
          intercepted him.</p>
  <p>"Has papa given any orders about the carriage,
          Benjamin?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, miss. I am to drive you and mistress into West
          Lynne. I was to get ready directly, he said."</p>
  <p>Back waltzed Barbara. "Mamma, it is all right: Benjamin
          is gone to get the carriage ready. You would like
          luncheon before you go? I will order in the
          tray."</p>
  <p>"Anything you please, my dear," said the sweet-tempered,
          gentle woman. "I don't know why, but I feel glad to
          go out to-day: perhaps, because it is lovely."</p>
  <p>Benjamin made ready his carriage and himself, drove out
          of the yard at the back, and brought the carriage
          round to the front gate. As Mrs. Hare and Barbara
          went down the path, Mr. Hare was in the garden
          still.</p>
  <p>"Thank you, Richard," she said as she passed him, a
          loving smile lighting her delicate face.</p>
  <p>"Mind you are home by the dinner hour, and don't let
          Barbara spend too much money," cried the justice, in
          return. But he was not polite enough to go and hand
          them in.</p>
  <p>The carriage—or phaeton, as it was often called— was a
          somewhat old-fashioned concern, as many country
          things are apt to be. A small box in front for the
          driver, and a wide seat with a head behind,
          accommodating Barbara well between them when Mr. and
          Mrs. Hare both sat in it. Mr. Hare, however,
          generally <pb n="279"/> drove, himself, taking no
          servant. The head was down to-day, but it was found
          convenient in rainy weather; and there were a double
          set of poles, so that one horse or a pair might be
          driven in it. Very rarely, never unless they were
          going a distance, was a pair used: the long-tailed,
          black coach horses were taken out in turn, for the
          justice kept but that pair; and a saddle-horse for
          himself.</p>
  <p>Benjamin drew the rug carefully over his mistress's
          knees—the servants did not like Mr. Hare, but would
          have laid down their lives for her—ascended to his
          box, and drove them to their destination, the
          linen-draper's. It was an excellent shop, situated a
          little beyond the office of Mr. Carlyle, and Mrs.
          Hare and Barbara were soon engaged in that
          occupation, said to possess for all women a
          fascination. They had been deep in it about an hour,
          when Mrs. Hare discovered that her bag was
          missing.</p>
  <p>"I must have left it in the carriage, Barbara. Go and
          bring it, will you, my dear? The pattern of that
          silk is in it."</p>
  <p>Barbara went out. The carriage and Benjamin and the sleek
          old horse were all waiting drowsily together.
          Barbara could not see the bag, and she appealed to
          the servant.</p>
  <p>"Find mamma's bag, Benjamin. It must be some-where in the
          carriage."</p>
  <p>Benjamin got off his box, and began to search. Barbara
          waited, gazing listlessly down the street. The sun
          was shining brilliantly, and its rays fell upon the
          large cable chain of a gentleman, who was sauntering
          idly up the pavement, making its gold links and its
          drooping seal and key glitter, as they crossed his
          waistcoat. It <pb n="280"/> shone also upon the
          enamelled gold studs of his shirt front, making
            <hi>them</hi> glitter; and as he suddenly raised
          his ungloved hand, a white hand, to stroke his
          moustache —by which action you may know a vain man—a
          diamond ring gleamed with a light that was
          positively dazzling. Involuntarily Barbara thought
          of the description her brother Richard had given of
          certain dazzling jewels worn by another.</p>
  <p>She watched him advance. He was a handsome man of,
          perhaps, seven or eight-and-twenty, tall, slender,
          and well made, his eyes and hair black. A very
          pleasant expression sat upon his countenance, and on
          the left hand he wore a light buff kid glove, and
          was swinging its fellow by the fingers, apparently
          in deep thought, as he softly whistled to himself.
          But for the great light cast at that moment by the
          sun, Barbara might not have noticed the jewellery,
          or connected it in her mind with the other jewellery
          in that unhappy secret.</p>
  <p>"Halloa! Thorn, is that you? Just step over here!"</p>
  <p>The speaker was Otway Bethel, who was on the opposite
          side of the street; the spoken-to, the gentleman
          with the jewellery. But the latter was in a brown
          study, and did not hear. Bethel called out again,
          louder.</p>
  <p>"Captain Thorn!"</p>
  <p>That was heard. Captain Thorn nodded, and turned short
          off across the street. Barbara stood like one in a
          dream, her brain, her mind, her fancy all a confused
          mass together.</p>
  <p>"Here's the bag, Miss Barbara. It had got among the folds
          of the rug."</p>
  <pb n="281"/>
  <p>Benjamin held it out to her, but she took no notice: she
          was unconscious of all external things, save one.
          That she beheld the real murderer of Hallijohn, she
          entertained no manner of doubt. In every particular
          he tallied with the description given by Richard:
          tall, dark, vain, handsome, delicate hands,
          jewellery, and— Captain Thorn! Barbara's cheeks grew
          white, and her heart turned sick.</p>
  <p>"The bag, Miss Barbara."</p>
  <p>But Barbara was gone, leaving Benjamin and the bag. She
          had caught sight of Mr. Wainwright the surgeon at a
          little distance, and sped towards him.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Wainwright," began she, forgetting ceremony in her
          agitation, "you see that gentleman, talking to Otway
          Bethel. Who is he?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Wainwright had to put his glasses across the bridge
          of his nose before he could answer, for he was
          short-sighted. "That? Oh, it is a Captain Thorn. He
          is visiting the Herberts, I believe."</p>
  <p>"Where does he come from? Where does he live?" reiterated
          Barbara, in her eagerness.</p>
  <p>"I don't know anything about him. I saw him this morning
          with young Smith, and he told me he was a friend of
          the Herberts. You are not looking well, Miss
          Barbara."</p>
  <p>She made no answer. Captain Thorn and Mr. Bethel came
          walking down the street, and the latter saluted her,
          but she was too much confused to respond to it. Mr.
          Wainwright then wished her good day, and Barbara
          walked slowly back. Mrs. Hare was appearing at the
          shop door.</p>
  <p>"My dear, how long you are! Cannot the bag be found?"</p>
  <pb n="282"/>
  <p>"I went to speak to Mr. Wainwright," answered Barbara,
          mechanically taking the bag from Benjamin and giving
          it to her mother, her whole heart and eyes still
          absorbed with that one object moving away in the
          distance.</p>
  <p>"You look pale, child. Are you well?"</p>
  <p>"Oh yes, quite. Let us get our shopping over, mamma."</p>
  <p>She moved on to their places at the counter as she spoke,
          eager to "get it over" and be at home, that she
          might have time for thought. Mrs. Hare wondered what
          had come to her; the pleasant interest, displayed in
          their purchases previously, was now gone; and she
          sat inattentive and absorbed.</p>
  <p>"Now, my dear, it is only waiting for you to choose.
          Which of the two silks will you have?"</p>
  <p>"Either. Any. Take which you like, mamma."</p>
  <p>"Barbara, what <hi>has</hi> come to you?"</p>
  <p>"I believe I am tired," said Barbara, with a forced
          laugh, as she compelled herself to pay some sort of
          attention. "I don't like the green: I will take the
          other."</p>
  <p>They arrived at home. Barbara was five minutes alone in
          her chamber, before the dinner was on the table. All
          the conclusion she could come to, was, that
            <hi>she</hi> could do nothing, save tell the facts
          to Archibald Carlyle.</p>
  <p>How could she contrive to see him? The business might
          admit of no delay. She supposed she must go to East
          Lynne that evening; but where would be her excuse
          for it at home? Puzzling over it, she went down to
          dinner. During the meal, Mrs. Hare began talking of
          some silk she had purchased for a mantle. <pb n="283"/> She should have it made like Miss
          Carlyle's new one: when Miss Carlyle was at the
          Grove the other day, about Wilson's character, she
          had offered her the pattern, and she, Mrs. Hare,
          would send one of the servants up for it after
          dinner.</p>
  <p>"Oh, mamma, let me go!" burst forth Barbara. She spoke so
          vehemently, that the justice paused in his carving,
          and demanded what ailed her. Barbara made some timid
          excuse.</p>
  <p>"Her eagerness is natural, Richard," smiled Mrs. Hare.
          "Barbara thinks she shall get a peep at the baby, I
          expect. All young folks are fond of babies."</p>
  <p>Barbara's face flushed crimson: but she did not
          contradict the opinion. She could not eat her
          dinner; she was too full of poor Richard: she played
          with it, and then sent away her plate, nearly
          untouched.</p>
  <p>"That's through the finery she has been buying,"
          pronounced Justice Hare. "Her head is stuffed up
          with it."</p>
  <p>No opposition was offered to Barbara's going to East
          Lynne. She reached it just as their dinner was over.
          It was for Miss Carlyle she asked.</p>
  <p>"Miss Carlyle is not at home, miss. She is spending the
          day out; and my lady does not receive visitors
          yet."</p>
  <p>It was a sort of checkmate. Barbara was compelled to say
          she would see Mr. Carlyle. Peter ushered her into
          the drawing-room, and Mr. Carlyle came to her.</p>
  <p>"I am so very sorry to disturb you; to have asked for
          you," began Barbara, with a burning face, for a
          certain evening interview of hers with him, twelve
          months before, was disagreeably present to her.
          Never, since that evening of agitation, had Barbara
          suffered herself <pb n="284"/> to betray emotion to
          Mr. Carlyle: her manners to him had been calm,
          courteous, and indifferent. And she now more
          frequently called him "Mr. Carlyle" than
          "Archibald."</p>
  <p>"Take a seat, take a seat, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"I asked for Miss Carlyle," she continued, "for mamma is
          in want of a pattern that she promised to lend her;
          but, in point of fact, it was you I wished to see.
          You remember the Lieutenant Thorn, whom Richard
          spoke of as being the real criminal?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"I think he is at West Lynne."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was aroused to eager interest. "He! That same
          Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"It can be no other. Mamma and I were shopping to-day,
          and I went out for her bag which she had left in the
          carriage. While Benjamin was getting it, I saw a
          stranger coming up the street; a tall, good-looking,
          dark-haired man, with a conspicuous gold chain and
          studs. The sun was full upon him, causing the
          ornaments to shine, especially a diamond ring which
          he wore, for he had one hand raised to his face. The
          thought flashed over me, 'That is like the
          description Richard gave of the man Thorn.' Why the
          idea should have occurred to me in that strange
          manner, I do not know, but it most assuredly did
          occur: though I did not really suppose him to be the
          same. Just then I heard him spoken to by some one on
          the other side the street, it was Otway Bethel, and
          he called him <hi>Captain Thorn</hi> ."</p>
  <p>"That is curious indeed, Barbara. I did not know any
          stranger was at West Lynne."</p>
  <p>"I saw Mr. Wainwright, and asked him who it was. <pb n="285"/> He said a Captain Thorn, a friend of the
          Herberts. A Lieutenant Thorn four or five years ago,
          would probably be Captain Thorn now."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle nodded, and there was a pause.</p>
  <p>"What can be done?" asked Barbara.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was passing one hand over his brow; it was a
          habit of his when deep in thought. "It is hard to
          say what is to be done, Barbara. The description you
          give of this man certainly tallies with that given
          by Richard. Did he look like a gentleman?"</p>
  <p>"Very much so. A remarkably aristocratic-looking man, as
          it struck me."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle again nodded assentingly. He remembered
          Richard's words, when describing the other; "an
          out-and-out aristocrat." "Of course, Barbara, the
          first thing must be to try and ascertain whether it
          is the same," he observed. "If we find that it is,
          then we must deliberate upon future measures. I will
          see what I can ascertain, and let you know."</p>
  <p>Barbara rose. Mr. Carlyle escorted her across the hall,
          and then strolled down the park by her side, deep in
          the subject; and quite unconscious that Lady
          Isabel's jealous eyes were watching them from her
          dressing-room window.</p>
  <p>"You say he seemed intimate with Otway Bethel?"</p>
  <p>"As to being intimate, I do not know. Otway Bethel spoke
          as though he knew him."</p>
  <p>"This must have caused excitement to Mrs. Hare."</p>
  <p>"You forget that mamma was not told anything about
          Thorn," was the answer of Barbara. "The uncertainty
          would have worried her to death. All Richard said to
          her was, that he was innocent, that it was a <pb n="286"/> stranger who did the deed, and she asked
          for no particulars: she has implicit faith in
          Richard's truth."</p>
  <p>"True; I did forget," replied Mr. Carlyle. "I wish we
          could find out some one who knew the other Thorn: to
          ascertain that they were the same would be a great
          point gained."</p>
  <p>He went as far as the park gates with Barbara, shook
          hands, and wished her good evening. Scarcely had she
          departed, when Mr. Carlyle saw two gentlemen
          advancing from the opposite direction, in one of
          whom he recognised Tom Herbert, and the
          other—instinct told him—was Captain Thorn. He waited
          till they came up.</p>
  <p>"If this isn't lucky, seeing you," cried Mr. Tom Herbert,
          who was a free-and-easy sort of gentleman, the
          second son of a brother justice of Mr. Hare's. "I
          wish to goodness you'd give us a draught of your
          cider, Carlyle. We went up to Beauchamp's for a
          stroll, but found them all out; and I'm awfully
          thirsty. Captain Thorn, Carlyle."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle invited them to his house, and ordered in
          refreshments. Young Herbert coolly threw himself
          into an arm-chair and lit a cigar. "Come, Thorn,"
          cried he, "here's a weed for you."</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn glanced towards Mr. Carlyle: he appeared of
          a far more gentlemanly nature than Tom Herbert.</p>
  <p>"You'll have one too, Carlyle," said Herbert, holding out
          his cigar-case. "Oh, I forgot; you are a muff; don't
          smoke one twice in a year. I say, how's Lady
          Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"Very ill still."</p>
  <p>"By Jove, is she, though? Tell her I am sorry to hear it,
          will you, Carlyle. But—I say! will she smell <pb n="287"/> the smoke?" asked he, with a mixture of
          alarm and concern in his face.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle reassured him upon that point, and turned to
          Captain Thorn.</p>
  <p>"Are you acquainted with this neighbourhood?"</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn smiled. "I only reached West Lynne
          yesterday."</p>
  <p>"You were never here before, then?" continued Mr.
          Carlyle, setting down the last as a probably evasive
          answer.</p>
  <p>"No."</p>
  <p>"He and my brother Jack, you know, are in the same
          regiment," put in Tom Herbert, with scant ceremony.
          "Jack had invited him down for some fishing, and
          Thorn arrives. But he never sent word he was coming.
          Jack had given him up, and is off on some Irish
          expedition, the deuce knows where. Precious unlucky
          that it should have happened so. Thorn says he shall
          cut short his stay, and go again."</p>
  <p>The conversation turned upon fishing, and in the heat of
          argument the stranger mentioned a certain pond, and
          its famous eels—"the Low Pond." Mr. Carlyle looked
          at him, speaking, however, in a careless manner.</p>
  <p>"Which do you mean? We have two ponds not far apart, each
          called the 'Low Pond.' "</p>
  <p>"I mean the one on an estate about three miles from here:
          Squire Thorpe's, unless I am mistaken."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle smiled. "I think you must have been in the
          neighbourhood before, Captain Thorn. Squire Thrope
          is dead, and the property has passed to his
          daughter's husband, and that Low Pond was filled up
          three years ago."</p>
  <p>"I have heard a friend mention it," was Captain <pb n="288"/> Thorn's reply, spoken in an indifferent
          tone, though he evidently wished not to pursue the
          subject.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, by easy degrees, turned the conversation
          upon Swainson, the place whence Richard Hare's
          Captain Thorn was suspected to have come. The
          present Captain Thorn said he knew it "a little," he
          had once been "staying there a short time." Mr.
          Carlyle became nearly convinced that Barbara's
          suspicions were correct. The descriptions certainly
          agreed, as far as he could judge, in the most minute
          particulars. The man before him wore two rings, a
          diamond—and a very beautiful diamond, too—on the one
          hand; a seal ring on the other; his hands were
          delicate to a degree, and his handkerchief, a
          cambric one of unusually fine texture, was not
          entirely guiltless of scent: a mark of dandyism,
          which, in the other Captain Thorn, used considerably
          to annoy Richard. Mr. Carlyle quitted the room for a
          moment, and summoned Joyce to him.</p>
  <p>"My lady has been asking for you, sir," said Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Tell her I will be up the moment these gentlemen leave.
          Joyce," he added, "find an excuse to come into the
          room presently; you can bring something or other in;
          I want you to look at this stranger who is with
          young Mr. Herbert. Notice him well; I fancy you may
          have seen him before."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle returned to the room, leaving Joyce
          surprised. However, she presently followed, taking
          in some water, and lingered a few minutes,
          apparently placing the things on the table in better
          order.</p>
  <p>When the two departed, Mr. Carlyle called Joyce, before
          proceeding to his wife's room. "Well?" he
          questioned, "did you recognise him?"</p>
  <p>"Not at all, sir. He seemed quite strange to me."</p>
  <pb n="289"/>
  <p>"Cast your thoughts back, Joyce. Did you never see him in
          years gone by?"</p>
  <p>Joyce looked puzzled, but she replied in the
          negative.</p>
  <p>"Is he the man, think you, who used to ride over from
          Swainson to see Afy?"</p>
  <p>Joyce's face flushed crimson. "Oh, sir!" was all she
          uttered.</p>
  <p>"The name is the same, Thorn: I thought it possible the
          men might be," observed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Sir, I cannot say. I never saw that Captain Thorn but
          once, and I don't know—I don't know"—Joyce spoke
          slowly and with consideration—"that I should at all
          know him again. I did not think of him when I looked
          at this gentleman; but at any rate, no appearance in
          this one struck upon my memory as being
          familiar."</p>
  <p>So, from Joyce Mr. Carlyle obtained no clue, one way or
          the other. The following day he sought out Otway
          Bethel.</p>
  <p>"Are you intimate with that Captain Thorn who is staying
          with the Herberts?" asked he.</p>
  <p>"Yes," answered Bethel, derisively, "if passing a couple
          of hours in his company can constitute intimacy.
          That's all I have seen of Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Are you sure?" pursued Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Sure!" returned Bethel; "why, what are you driving at
          now? I called in at Herbert's the night before last,
          and Tom asked me to stay the evening. Thorn had just
          come. A jolly bout we had; cigars and cold
          punch."</p>
  <p>"Bethel," said Mr. Carlyle, dashing to the point, "is it
          the Thorn who used to go after Afy Hallijohn? Come,
          you can tell if you like."</p>
  <pb n="290"/>
  <p>Bethel remained dumb for a moment, apparently with
          amazement. "What a confounded lie!" uttered he, at
          length. "Why, it's no more that Thorn than—What
          Thorn?" he broke off, abruptly.</p>
  <p>"You are equivocating, Bethel. The Thorn who was mixed
          up—or said to be—in the Hallijohn affair. Is this
          the same man?"</p>
  <p>"You are a fool, Carlyle: which is what I never took you
          to be yet," was Mr. Bethel's rejoinder, spoken in a
          savage tone. "I have told you that I never knew
          there was any Thorn mixed up with Afy, and I should
          like to know why my word is not to be believed? I
          never saw Thorn in my life till I saw him the other
          night at the Herberts', and that I would take an
          oath to, if put to it."</p>
  <p>Bethel quitted Mr. Carlyle with the last word, and the
          latter gazed after him, revolving points in his
          brain. The mention of Thorn's name (the one spoken
          of by Richard Hare) appeared to excite some sore
          feeling in Bethel's mind, arousing it to irritation.
          Mr. Carlyle remembered that it had done so
          previously, and now it had done so again: and yet,
          Bethel was an easy-natured man in general, far
          better-tempered than principled. That there was
          something hidden, some mystery connected with the
          affair, Mr. Carlyle felt sure, but he could not
          attempt so much as a guess at what it might be. And
          his interview with Bethel brought him no nearer the
          point he wished to find out—whether this Thorn was
          the same man. In walking back to his office, he met
          Mr. Tom Herbert.</p>
  <p>"Does Captain Thorn purpose making a long stay with you?"
          he stopped him to inquire.</p>
  <p>"He's gone: I have just seen him off by the train," <pb n="291"/> was the reply of Tom Herbert. "It seemed
          rather slow work for him without Jack, so he
          shortened his visit, and says he will pay us one
          when Jack's to the fore."</p>
  <p>As Mr. Carlyle went home to dinner that evening, he
          entered the Grove, ostensibly to make a short call
          on Mrs. Hare. Barbara, on the tenterhooks of
          impatience, accompanied him outside when he
          departed, and walked down the path.</p>
  <p>"What have you learnt?" she eagerly asked.</p>
  <p>"Nothing satisfactory," was the reply of Mr. Carlyle.
          "The man is gone."</p>
  <p>"Gone!" said Barbara.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle explained. He told her how they had come to
          his house the previous evening after Barbara's
          departure, and his encounter with Tom Herbert that
          day: he mentioned, also, his interview with
          Bethel.</p>
  <p>"Can he have gone on purpose, fearing consequences?"
          wondered Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Scarcely: or why should he have come?"</p>
  <p>"You did not suffer any word to escape you last night,
          causing him to suspect that he was doubted?"</p>
  <p>"Not any. You would make a bad lawyer, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Who or what is he?"</p>
  <p>"An officer in her Majesty's service, in John Herbert's
          regiment. I ascertained no more. Tom said he was of
          good family. But I cannot help suspecting it is the
          same man."</p>
  <p>"Can nothing more be done?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing, in the present stage of the affair," concluded
          Mr. Carlyle, as he passed through the gate to
          continue his way. "We can only wait on again with
            <pb n="292"/> what patience we may, hoping that
          time will bring about its own elucidation."</p>
  <p>Barbara pressed her forehead down on the cold iron of the
          gate as his footsteps died away. "Ay, to wait on,"
          she murmured, "to wait on in dreary pain; to wait
          on, perhaps for years, perhaps for ever! And poor
          Richard—wearing out his days in poverty and
          exile!"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel recovered, and grew strong. And a few years
          passed smoothly on, no particular event occurring to
          note them.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER I. GOING FROM HOME.</head>
  <p>A <hi>few</hi> years had passed on.</p>
  <p>"I should recommend a complete change of scene
          altogether, Mr. Carlyle. Say some place on the
          French or Belgian coast. Sea-bathing might do
          wonders."</p>
  <p>"Should you think it well for her to go so far from
          home!"</p>
  <p>"I should. Where there is any chronic or confirmed
          disorder, one we can grapple with, I don't care a
          straw for change of scene or air, a patient is as
          well at his own home as away, a certain treatment
          must be gone through, surgical or physical, and it
          is of little moment whether it is pursued on a
          mountain in Switzerland or in a vale in Devonshire.
          But in these cases of protracted weakness, where you
          can do nothing but try to coax the strength back
          again, change of air and scene are of immense
          benefit."</p>
  <p>"I will propose it to her," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I have just done so," replied Dr. Martin, who was the
          other speaker. "She met it with objection; which <pb n="294"/> I expected, for invalids naturally feel
          a disinclination to move from home. But it is
          necessary that she should go."</p>
  <p>The object of their conversation was Lady Isabel. There
          were three children now at East Lynne; Isabel,
          William, and Archibald; the latter twelve months
          old. Lady Isabel had, a month or two back, been
          attacked with illness: she recovered from it; that
          is, she recovered from the disorder; but it had left
          her in an alarming state of weakness. Mr. Wainwright
          tried in vain to grapple with the weakness; she
          seemed to get worse, rather than better, and Dr.
          Martin was summoned from Lynneborough. The best
          thing he could recommend —as you have seen—was
          change of scene and air.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel was unwilling to take the advice; more
          especially to go so far as the "French coast." And
          but for a circumstance that seemed to have happened
          purposely to induce her to decide, would probably
          never have gone. Mrs. Ducie—the reader may not have
          forgotten her name—had, in conjunction with her
          husband the Honourable Augustus, somewhat run
          herself out at elbows, and found it convenient to
          enter for a time on the less expensive life of the
          Continent. For eighteen months she had been staying
          in Paris, the education of her younger daughters
          being the plea put forth for the sojourn, and a very
          convenient plea it is, and serves hundreds. Isabel
          had had two or three letters from her during her
          absence, and she now received another, saying they
          were going to spend a month or two at
          Boulognesur-Mer. Dr. Martin and Mr. Wainwright,
          declared that this must remove all Lady Isabel's
          unwillingness to go from home, for Mrs. Ducie's
          society would do <pb n="295"/> away with the
          loneliness she had anticipated, which had been the
          ostensible score of her objection.</p>
  <p>"Boulogne-sur-Mer, of all places in the world!"
          remonstrated Lady Isabel. "It is spoken of as being
          crowded and vulgar."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle also demurred to Boulogne-sur-Mer. It did not
          stand high in his estimation. It was not a place he
          cared to send his wife to: the more especially as he
          could not remain with her. Trouville, a pleasant,
          retired watering-place, situated near Harfleur, and
          little known in those days, had been the one fixed
          upon. Lady Isabel, probably, would have found it
          dull.</p>
  <p>Dr. Martin strongly urged it's being changed for
          Boulogne. "What did it matter if Boulogne was
          crowded and vulgar?" he asked: "there would be the
          more amusement for Lady Isabel. He had had his
          doubts of Trouville before, in regard to its
          dullness: by all means let her go to Boulogne to
          join Mrs. Ducie."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle yielded the point, and finished by approving
          it. And Lady Isabel, finding she had no chance
          against them all, consented to go, and plans were
          hastily decided upon.</p>
  <p>She certainly was looking very ill; her features were
          white and attenuated, her sweet, sad eyes had grown
          larger and darker, her hands were hot and sickly.
          Though warm weather, she had generally a shawl
          folded round her, and would sit for hours without
          rousing herself, as those, suffering from great
          weakness, like to do; would sit gazing out on the
          calm landscape, or watching her children at play.
          She went out once a day in the close carriage, and
          that was all: no other exertion could she be aroused
          to make.</p>
  <pb n="296"/>
  <p>In this illness the old trouble had come back again— the
          sore feeling touching her husband and Barbara Hare.
          It had lain pretty dormant in the last few years,
          nothing have occurred to excite it: but Lady Isabel
          was in that state of weakness, where grievances, let
          them be old or new, grow upon the mind. Her thoughts
          would wander to the unsatisfactory question of
          whether Mr. Carlyle had ever truly loved her; or
          whether, lured by her rank and her beauty, he had
          married her, loving Barbara. Mr. Carlyle's
          demonstrative affection, shown so greatly for her in
          the first twelve months or so of their married life,
          had subsided into calmness. Is not a similar result
          arrived at by every husband that the Church ever
          made one with woman? It was not that his love had
          faded, but that time and custom had wrought their
          natural effects. Look at children with their toys; a
          boy with a new drum, a girl with a new doll. Are not
          the playthings kissed, and hugged, and clasped in
          arms, and never put down? Did ever playthings seem
          like them? Are not all others things neglected, or
          submitted to unwillingly—the reading lessons, the
          sports, the daily works, even the pudding at dinner,
          while the new toy is all in all? But, wait. A little
          time, and the drum (if it has escaped breakage) is
          consigned to some dark closet; the doll to its
          cradle; and neither of them is visited or looked at.
          Tell the children to go and get their
          lately-cherished playthings, to make them their
          evening's amusement; and they will go unwillingly
          (if they don't openly rebel), for they are tired of
          them. It is of no use scolding the children for
          being fickle: it is in their nature to be fickle,
          for they are human. Are grown children otherwise? Do
          we not all, men and women, become indifferent to our
            <pb n="297"/> toys when we hold them securely in
          possession? Young lady, when he, who is soon to be
          your lord and master, protests to you that he shall
          always be as ardent a lover as he is now, believe
          him if you like, but don't reproach him when the
          disappointment comes. He does not wilfully deceive
          you; he only forgets that it is in the constitution
          of man to change, the very essence of his nature.
          The time will arrive when his manner must settle
          down into a calmness, which to you, if you be of an
          exacting temperament, may look like indifference, or
          coldness; but you will do well to put up with it,
          for it will never now be otherwise. Never: the
          heyday of early love, of youth, and of novelty is
          past.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel did not understand the even manner, the quiet
          calmness into which her husband's once passionate
          love had subsided, and in her fanciful jealousy she
          attributed it to the influence Barbara held upon his
          memory. She looked for the little tender episodes of
          daily life: she would fain have had him hang over
          her chair as she sang, and draw her face to his, and
          feel his kisses on her lips, as when she first came,
          a wife, to East Lynne. It has been seen that Lady
          Isabel did not love Mr. Carlyle; but his tenderness,
          his anxious care for her in their early married
          days, caused her to lift up her heart to him with
          gratitude, and to try earnestly to love him. But—to
          try to love! Vain effort: love never yet came for
          the <hi>trying:</hi> it is a capricious passion, and
          generally comes without the knowledge and against
          the will. It is possible she thought she had
          succeeded, for her whole esteem, her respect, and
          her admiration were his. When she compared him with
          other men, and saw how far he surpassed <pb n="298"/> them, how noble and how good he was, how little
          the rest looked beside him, her heart rose up with
          pride at the consciousness of being his wife: a
          princess might have deemed it an honour to be the
          chosen of such a man as Archibald Carlyle. Spare one
          single corner of <hi>his</hi> heart to Barbara Hare!
          No indeed; Isabel could not afford that.</p>
  <p>On the day that the journey was finally decided, Lady
          Isabel was in the drawing-room with her three
          children; even the little fellow was sitting on the
          carpet. Isabel was a delicate, pretty child in her
          fifth year, William was the very image of his
          mother, Archibald was like Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Come hither, my darlings," she cried.</p>
  <p>Isabel and William ran to her, and she placed an arm
          round each. Master Archie was kicking his heels on
          the carpet at a distance. They looked up at their
          mother.</p>
  <p>"Would my little dears like to go a great way with mamma?
          Over the sea in a boat?"</p>
  <p>Isabel—she had inherited the refined, sensitive feelings
          of her mother—replied only by a smile and a vivid
          blush. William clapped his hands. "Oh yes, in a
          boat! Arty too, mamma?"</p>
  <p>"Archie and all," answered Lady Isabel. "And Joyce, and
          Wilson, and—"</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle, who was seated near one of the windows,
          sewing, turned sharply round to interrupt the
          gladness. Miss Carlyle, though not openly
          dissenting, did not inwardly approve of the proposed
          emigration. What did people want with change of air?
          thought she. <hi>She</hi> had never wanted any. A
          pack of new-fangled notions that doctors had got
          into, recommending change of air <pb n="299"/> for
          everything! they'd order it, next, for a cut finger.
          If Lady Isabel would make an effort, she'd get
          strong fast enough at home.</p>
  <p>"The children are not going to the sea-side," said she.
          "They are not ordered there."</p>
  <p>"But they must go with me," replied Lady Isabel. "Of
          course they are not expressly ordered to it. Why
          should they not go?"</p>
  <p>"Why should they not?" retorted Miss Corny. "Why, on
          account of the expense, to be sure. I can tell you
          what it is, Lady Isabel, what with one expense and
          another, your husband will soon be on the road to
          ruin. Your journey with Joyce and Peter will cost
          enough, ma'am, without taking a van-load of nurses
          and children."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel's heart sank within her.</p>
  <p>"Besides, your object, in going, is to pick up health,
          and how can you do that, if you are to be worried
          with the children?" pursued Miss Corny. "People who
          go abroad for pleasure, or invalids in search of
          health, won't find much of either, if they carry
          their cares with them."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel rose and, with difficulty, lifted Archibald
          from the carpet; sat down with him on her knee, and
          pressed his little face to hers.</p>
  <p>"Would my baby like mamma to go away and leave him?" she
          asked, the tears falling fast on his fair curls.
          "Oh! I could not leave them behind me!" she added,
          looking imploringly at Miss Carlyle. "I should get
          no better if you send me there alone; I should ever
          be yearning for the children."</p>
  <p>"Alone, Lady Isabel! Is your husband nothing?"</p>
  <p>"But he will only take me; he will not remain."</p>
  <pb n="300"/>
  <p>"Well, you can't expect his business to go to rack and
          ruin," snapped Miss Corny. "How can he stay away
          from it? With all these heavy expenses upon him,
          there's more need than ever for his sticking to it
          closely. And, before the children are gallavanted
          over the water, it might be as well to sit down and
          calculate the cost. Of course, Lady Isabel, I only
          offer my opinion; you are Archibald's wife, and sole
          mistress, and will do as you please."</p>
  <p>Do as she pleased! Poor Lady Isabel laid her head meekly
          down upon her children, effectually silenced, and
          her heart breaking with pain. Joyce, who was then in
          the room, heard a little, and conjectured much of
          what had passed.</p>
  <p>In the evening, Mr. Carlyle carried little Isabel up to
          the nursery on his shoulder. Joyce happened to be
          there, and thought it a good opportunity to
          speak.</p>
  <p>"My lady wishes to take the children with her to France,
          sir."</p>
  <p>"Does she?" replied Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"And I fear she will make herself very unhappy if they do
          not go, sir."</p>
  <p>"Why should they not go?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>He went back to the drawing-room, where his wife was
          alone. "Isabel, do you wish to take the children
          with you?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, I did so wish it!" she replied, the hectic of hope
          lighting her pale cheeks. "If they might but go,
          Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"Of course they may go. It will be a nice change for
          them, as well as for you. Why should you
          hesitate?"</p>
  <pb n="301"/>
  <p>"The expense," she timidly whispered, the hectic growing
          deeper.</p>
  <p>He looked right into her eyes with his pleasant smile.
          "Expense is no concern of yours, Isabel: it is mine.
          Never let the word, expense, trouble you, until I
          tell you that it must."</p>
  <p>"It will not increase the cost so very much," she
          returned, her eyes smiling with happiness. "And I
          shall get well all the sooner for having them with
          me."</p>
  <p>"And, to further that, you should take them, if it were
          to the end of the world. Why should you study aught
          but your own wishes and comfort?"</p>
  <p>She took his hand in her love and gratitude—for every
          tone of his voice spoke of care and tenderness for
          her; all jealous fancies were forgotten, all
          recollection, in that moment, that his manner was
          calmer than of old. "Archibald! I do believe you
          care for me as much as you used to?"</p>
  <p>He did not understand the words, but he held her to him
          as in days gone by, and kissed her tenderly. "More
          precious, far more precious to me than of yore,
          Isabel!"</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle flew out when she heard the decision, and
          frightened her brother to repentance, assuring him
          that his sending the children was the certain way to
          preclude all chance of his wife's recovery. Mr.
          Carlyle was sorely puzzled between Isabel's wishes
          and Isabel's welfare: he would promote both if he
          could, but if they clashed—? He feared his own
          judgment, he feared his wife's; and he appealed to
          the medical men. But Miss Corny had forestalled him
          there: she had contrived so to impress those
          gentlemen of the incessant worry the children would
          prove <pb n="302"/> to Lady Isabel, that they
          pronounced their veto, and forbade the children's
          going. So, after all, Lady Isabel had to resign
          herself to the disappointment.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," said she to her waiting-maid, "I shall leave you
          at home; I must take Wilson instead."</p>
  <p>"Oh, my lady! what have I done?"</p>
  <p>"You have done all that you ought, Joyce, but you must
          stay with the children. If I may not take them, the
          next best thing will be to leave them with you. I
          shall give them into your charge, not into Miss
          Carlyle's," she said, sinking her voice: "if it were
          Wilson who remained, I could not do that."</p>
  <p>"My lady, I must do whatever you think best. I wish I
          could attend you and stay with them, but of course I
          cannot do both."</p>
  <p>"I am sent away to get health and strength, but it may be
          I shall die, Joyce. If I never come back, will you
          promise to remain with my children?"</p>
  <p>Joyce felt a creeping sensation in her veins: the sobs
          rose in her throat, but she swallowed them down, and
          constrained her voice to calmness. "My lady, I hope
          you will come back to us as well as you used to be.
          I trust you will hope so too, my lady, and not give
          way to low spirits."</p>
  <p>"I sincerely hope and trust I shall," answered Lady
          Isabel, fervently. "Still, there is no telling, for
          I am very ill. Joyce, give me your promise in case
          of the worst, that you will remain with the
          children."</p>
  <p>"I will, my lady—as long as I am permitted."</p>
  <p>"And be kind to them, and love them, and shield them
          from—from—any unkindness that may be put upon them,"
          she added, her head full of Miss Carlyle. <pb n="303"/> "And talk to them sometimes of their
          poor mother who is gone."</p>
  <p>"I will I will: oh, my lady, I will!" And Joyce sat down
          in the rocking-chair as Lady Isabel quitted her, and
          burst into tears.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER II. FRANCIS LEVISON.</head>
  <p><hi>Mr. Carlyle</hi> and Lady Isabel, with Wilson and
          Peter in attendance, arrived at Boulogne, and
          proceeded to the Hôtel des Bains. It may be as well
          to mention that Peter had been transferred from Miss
          Carlyle's service to theirs, when the establishment
          was first formed at East Lynne. Upon entering the
          hotel, they inquired for Mrs. Ducie, and then a
          disappointment awaited them: a letter was handed
          them, which had arrived that morning from Mrs.
          Ducie, expressing her regret that certain family
          arrangements prevented her visiting Boulogne; she
          was proceeding to some of the baths in Germany
          instead.</p>
  <p>"I might almost have know it," remarked Isabel. "She was
          always the most changeable of women."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle proposed that they should, after all, go on
          to Trouville, but Isabel said she would stay, now
          she had come. He went out in search of lodgings,
          Isabel objecting to remain in the bustling hotel. He
          succeeded in finding some very desirable ones,
          situated in the Rue de I'Ecu, near the port, and
          they moved into them. He thought the journey had
          done her good, for she looked better, and said she
          already felt stronger. Mr. Carlyle remained with her
          three days; he had <pb n="305"/> promised only one,
          but he was pleased with Isabel's returning glimpses
          of health, and amused with the scenes of the busy
          town.</p>
  <p>"I shall make no acquaintance here," Isabel observed to
          him, as they sat together at the end of the first
          division of the pier, which she had reached without
          much fatigue, and watched the gay idlers flocking
          past them.</p>
  <p>"It would not be advisable to do so indiscriminately," he
          replied, "but you may chance to find some whom you
          know. All sorts of people come over here: some
          respectable, and from respectable motives; others
          the contrary. Some of these men, going by now, are
          here because they have kites flying in England."</p>
  <p>"Kites!" echoed Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Kites, and bills, and ghosts of renewed acceptances,"
          returned Mr. Carlyle. "And well for them if they are
          over here for nothing else. The worse a man's
          conduct has been at home, the more assurance he puts
          on abroad, and is the first to rush and proclaim his
          arrival at the consulate. To hear these men boast,
          we might deem they were millionaires in England, and
          had led the lives of saints."</p>
  <p>"You have never stayed in these continental towns,
          Archibald: how do you know this?"</p>
  <p>"I have had plenty to do with those who have stayed in
          them. There goes Buxton!" he suddenly exclaimed; "he
          sees me, too. Look at him, Isabel. He does not know
          whether to come on, or to turn and make a run for
          it."</p>
  <p>"Who? Which?" inquired Isabel, confused by the many
          passers-by.</p>
  <p>"That stout, well-dressed man with the light hair, and
          bunch of seals hanging to his watch-chain. He <pb n="306"/> thinks better of it, and comes on. All
          safe, my good sir, on Boulogne pier, but if they
          catch you on the other side the water—Here comes his
          wife, following with some ladies. Look at her
          satins, and her chains, and her hanging
          bracelets—all swindled out of credulous
          tradespeople. There's not a doubt they are playing
          at being grand people in the English society here.
          It must be as good as a comedy to be behind the
          scenes in this Anglo-French town, and watch the airs
          and graces of some of its sojourners. Are you tired,
          Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"A little. I should like to return."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle rose, and giving his arm to his wife, they
          walked slowly down the pier. Many an eye was turned
          to look at them; at his tall, noble form; at her
          young beauty; at the unmistakable air of distinction
          which enshrined both: they were not like the
          ordinary visitors of Boulogne-sur-Mer.</p>
  <p>The tide served at eight o'clock the following morning,
          and Mr. Carlyle left by the Folkestone boat. Wilson
          made his breakfast, and after swallowing it in
          haste, he returned to his wife's room to say
          farewell.</p>
  <p>"Good bye, my love," he said, stooping to kiss her. "Take
          care of yourself."</p>
  <p>"Give my dear love to the darlings, Archibald.
          And—and—"</p>
  <p>"And what?" he asked. "I have not a moment to lose."</p>
  <p>"Do not get making love to Barbara Hare while I am
          away."</p>
  <p>She spoke in a tone half jest, half serious—could he but
          have seen how her heart was beating! Mr. Carlyle
          took it wholly as a jest, and went away laughing.
          Had <pb n="307"/> he believed she was serious, he
          could have been little more surprised had she
          charged him not to go about the country on a
          dromedary.</p>
  <p>Isabel rose later, and lingered over her breakfast,
          listless enough. She was wondering how she could
          make the next few weeks pass: what she should do
          with her time. She had taken two sea-baths since her
          arrival, but they had appeared not to agree with
          her, leaving her low and shivering afterwards, so it
          was not deemed advisable that she should attempt
          more. It was a lovely morning, and she determined to
          venture on to the pier, where they had been the
          previous evening. She had not Mr. Carlyle's arm, but
          it was not far, and she could take a good rest at
          the end of it.</p>
  <p>She went, attended by Peter, took her seat, and told him
          to come for her in an hour. She watched the
          strollers on the pier; not in crowds now, but
          stragglers, coming on at intervals. There came a
          gouty man, in a list shoe, there came three young
          ladies and their governess, there came two fast
          puppies in shooting-jackets and eye-glasses, which
          they turned with a broad stare on Lady Isabel; but
          there was something about her which caused them to
          drop their glasses and their ill manners together.
          After an interval, there appeared another, a tall,
          handsome, gentlemanly man. Her eyes fell upon him;
          and—what was it that caused every nerve in her frame
          to vibrate, every pulse to quicken? <hi>Whose</hi>
          form was it that was thus advancing, and changing
          the monotony of her mind into a tumult? It was that
          of one whom she was soon to find had never been
          entirely forgotten.</p>
  <p>Captain Levison came slowly on, approaching the part of
          the pier where she sat. He glanced at her, not <pb n="308"/> with the hardihood displayed by the two
          young men, but with quite sufficiently evident
          admiration.</p>
  <p>"What a lovely girl!" thought he to himself. "Who can she
          be, sitting there alone?" All at once a recollection
          flashed into his mind: he raised his hat and
          extended his hand, his fascinating smile in full
          play.</p>
  <p>"I certainly cannot be mistaken. Have I not the honour of
          once more meeting Lady Isabel Vane?"</p>
  <p>She allowed him to take her hand, answering a few words
          at random, for her wits seemed to have gone
          wool-gathering.</p>
  <p>"I beg your pardon—I should have said Lady Isabel
          Carlyle. Time has elapsed since we parted, and in
          the pleasure of seeing you again so unexpectedly, I
          thought of you as you were then."</p>
  <p>She sat down again, the brilliant flush of emotion dying
          away on her cheeks. It was the loveliest face
          Francis Levison had seen since he had last seen
          hers, and he thought so as he gazed at it.</p>
  <p>"What can have brought you to this place?" he inquired,
          taking a seat by her.</p>
  <p>"I have been ill," she explained, "and am ordered to the
          sea-side. We should not have come here but for Mrs.
          Ducie: we expected to meet her. Mr. Carlyle only
          left me this morning."</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Ducie is off to Ems. I see them occasionally. They
          have been fixtures in Paris for some time. You do
          indeed look ill!" he abruptly added, in a tone of
          sympathy, "alarmingly ill. Is there anything I can
          do for you?"</p>
  <p>She was aware that she looked unusually ill at that
          moment, for the agitation and surprise of meeting
          him <pb n="309"/> were fading away, leaving her face
          of an ashy whiteness. She was exceedingly vexed and
          angry with herself, that the meeting him should have
          had power to call forth emotion. Until that moment
          she was unconscious that she retained any sort of
          feeling for Captain Levison.</p>
  <p>"Perhaps I have ventured out too early," she said, in a
          tone that would seem to apologise for her looks; "I
          think I will return. I shall meet my servant, no
          doubt. Good morning, Captain Levison."</p>
  <p>"But indeed you do not appear fit to walk alone," he
          remonstrated. "You must allow me to see you safely
          home."</p>
  <p>Drawing her hand within his arm quite as a matter of
          course, as he had done many a time in the days gone
          by, he proceeded to assist her down the pier. Lady
          Isabel, conscious of her own feelings, felt that it
          was not quite the thing to walk thus familiarly with
          him, but he was a sort of relation of the family—a
          connexion at any rate, and she could find no ready
          excuse for declining.</p>
  <p>"Have you seen Lady Mount Severn lately?" he
          inquired.</p>
  <p>"I saw her when I was in London this spring with Mr.
          Carlyle. The first time we have met since my
          marriage: we do not correspond. Lord Mount Severn
          has paid us some visits at East Lynne. They are in
          town yet, I believe."</p>
  <p>"For all I know. I have not seen them, or England either,
          for ten months. I have been staying in Paris, and
          got here yesterday."</p>
  <p>"A long leave of absence," she observed.</p>
  <p>"Oh, I have left the army. I sold out. The truth is, Lady
          Isabel—for I don't mind telling you—things <pb n="310"/> are rather down with me at present. My
          old uncle has behaved shamefully: he has married
          again."</p>
  <p>"I heard that Sir Peter had married."</p>
  <p>"He is seventy-three—the old simpleton! Of course this
          materially alters my prospects, for it is just
          possible he may have a son of his own now; and my
          creditors all came down upon me. They allowed me to
          run into debt with complacency when I was heir to
          the title and estates, but as soon as Sir Peter's
          marriage appeared in the papers, myself and my
          consequence dropped a hundred per cent.; credit was
          stopped, and I was dunned for payment. So I sold out
          and came abroad."</p>
  <p>"Leaving your creditors?"</p>
  <p>"What else could I do? My uncle would not pay them, or
          increase my allowance."</p>
  <p>"What are your prospects, then?" resumed Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Prospects? Do you see that little ragged boy, throwing
          stones into the harbour?—it is well if the police
          don't drop upon him. Ask him what his prospects are,
          and he would stare in your face, and say, 'None.'
          Mine are on a par."</p>
  <p>"You may succeed Sir Peter yet."</p>
  <p>"I may: but I may not. When these old idiots get a young
          wife—"</p>
  <p>"Have you quarrelled with Sir Peter?" interrupted Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I should quarrel with him, as he deserves, if it would
          do any good; but I might get my allowance stopped.
          Self-interest, you see, Lady Isabel, is the order of
          the day with most of us."</p>
  <p>"Do you purpose staying in Boulogne long?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know. As I may find amusement. Paris <pb n="311"/> is a fast capital, with its heated rooms and its
          late hours, and I came down for the refreshment of a
          few sea dips. Am I walking too fast for you?"</p>
  <p>"You increased your pace alarmingly when you spoke of Sir
          Peter's marriage. And I am not sorry for it," she
          added, good naturedly, "for it has proved to me how
          strong I am getting. A week ago I could not have
          walked half so fast."</p>
  <p>He interrupted with eager apologies, and soon they
          reached her home. Captain Levison entered with her—
          uninvited. He probably deemed that between
          connexions great ceremony might be dispensed with,
          and he sat a quarter of an hour, chatting to amuse
          her. When he rose, he inquired what she meant to do
          with herself in the afternoon.</p>
  <p>"To lie down," replied Lady Isabel. "I am not strong
          enough to sit up all day."</p>
  <p>"Should you be going out again afterwards, you must allow
          me to take care of you," he observed. "I am glad
          that I happen to be here, for I am sure you are not
          fit to wander out only followed by a servant. When
          Mr. Carlyle comes, he will thank me for my
          pains."</p>
  <p>What was she to urge in objection? Simply nothing. He
          spoke, let us not doubt, from a genuine wish to
          serve her, in a plain, easy tone, as any
          acquaintance might speak. Lady Isabel schooled
          herself severely; if those old feelings were not
          quite dead within her, why, she must smother them
          down again as effectually as it they were: the very
          fact of recognising such to her own heart, brought
          its glow of shame to her brow. She would meet
          Captain Levison and suffer his companionship as she
          would that of the most indifferent stranger.</p>
  <pb n="312"/>
  <p>It was just the wrong way for her to go to work.</p>
  <p>As the days passed on, Lady Isabel improved wonderfully.
          She was soon able to go to the sands in a morning
          and sit there to enjoy the sea-air, watching the
          waves come up or recede with the tide. She made no
          acquaintance whatever in the place, and when she had
          a companion it was Captain Levison. He would
          frequently join her there, sometimes take her,
          almost always give her his arm home. She disliked
          having to take his arm; her conscience whispered it
          might be better if she did not. One day she said, in
          a joking sort of manner—she would not say it in any
          other—that now she was strong she had no need of his
          arm and his escort. He demanded, in evident
          astonishment, what had arisen that he might not
          still afford it, as her husband was not with her to
          give her his. She had no answer to reply to this, no
          excuse to urge, and, in default of one, took his arm
          as usual. In the evening he was always-ready to take
          her to the pier, but they sat apart, mixing not with
          the bustling crowd, he lending to his manner, as he
          conversed with her, all that it could call up of
          fascination—and fascination, such as Francis
          Levison's, might be dangerous to any ear in the
          sweet evening twilight. The walk over, he left her
          at her own door; in the evening she never asked him
          in, and he did not intrude without, as he sometimes
          would of a morning.</p>
  <p>Now where was the help for this? You may say shat she
          should have remained in-doors, and not have
          tubjected herself to his companionship. But the
          remaining in-doors would not have brought her
          health, and it was health that she was staying in
          Boulogne to acquire, and the sooner it came the
          better pleased she <pb n="313"/> would be, for she
          wanted to be at home with her husband and
          children.</p>
  <p>In a fortnight from the period of his departure, Mr.
          Carlyle was expected in Boulogne. But what a
          marvellous change had this fortnight wrought in Lady
          Isabel! She did not dare to analyse her feelings,
          but she was conscious that all the fresh emotions of
          her youth had come again. The blue sky seemed as of
          the sweetest sapphire, the green fields and the
          waving trees were of an emerald brightness, the
          perfume of the flowers was more fragrant than any
          perfume had yet seemed. She knew that the sky, that
          the grassy plains, the leafy trees, the brilliant
          flowers were but as they ever had been; she knew
          that the sunny atmosphere possessed no more of
          loveliness, or power of imparting delight, than of
          old: and she knew that the change, the sensation of
          ecstasy, was in her own heart. No wonder that she
          shrank from self-examination.</p>
  <p>The change from listless languor to her present feelings
          brought the hue and contour of health to her face
          far sooner than anything else could have done. She
          went down with Captain Levison to meet Mr. Carlyle
          the evening he came in, and when Mr. Carlyle saw her
          behind the cords as he was going to the
          custom-house, he scarcely knew her. Her features had
          lost their sharpness, her cheeks wore a rosy flush,
          and the light of pleasure at meeting him again shone
          in her eyes.</p>
  <p>"What can you have been doing to yourself, my darling?"
          he uttered in delight, as he emerged from the
          custom-house and took her hands in his. "You look
          almost well."</p>
  <p>"Yes, I am much better, Archibald, but I am warm now and
          flushed. We have waited here some time; <pb n="314"/> and the setting sun was full upon us. How long
          the boat was, coming in."</p>
  <p>"The wind was dead against us," replied Mr. Carlyle,
          wondering who the exquisite was, at his wife's side.
          He thought he remembered his face.</p>
  <p>"Captain Levison," said Lady Isabel. "I wrote you word in
          one of my letters that he was here. Have you
          forgotten it?" Yes, it had slipped from his
          memory.</p>
  <p>"And I am pleased that it happened to be so," said that
          gentleman, interposing, "for it has enabled me to
          attend Lady Isabel in some of her walks. She is
          stronger now, but at first she was unfit to venture
          alone."</p>
  <p>"I feel much indebted to you," said Mr. Carlyle,
          warmly.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel had taken her husband's arm, and Francis
          Levison walked by the side of Mr. Carlyle. "To tell
          you the truth," he said, dropping his voice so that
          it reached only Mr. Carlyle's ear, "when I met Lady
          Isabel, I was shocked to see her. I thought her days
          were numbered; that a very short period must close
          them. I therefore considered it a bounden duty to
          render her any slight service that might be in my
          power."</p>
  <p>"I am sure she has been obliged for your attention,"
          responded Mr. Carlyle. "And as to her visible
          improvement, it seems little short of a miracle. I
          expected, from Lady Isabel's letters to me, to find
          her better, but she is more than better; she looks
          well. Do you hear, Isabel? I say a miracle must have
          been wrought, to bring back your bloom, for a
          fortnight's space of time <pb n="315"/> could
          scarcely have done it. This must be a famous air for
          invalids."</p>
  <p>The bloom, that Mr. Carlyle spoke of, deepened to a
          glowing crimson as she listened. She knew—and she
          could not stifle the knowledge, however she might
          wish to do so—that it was not the place or the
          sea-air which had renovated her heart and her
          countenance. But she clasped her husband's arm the
          closer, and inwardly prayed for strength and power
          to thrust away from her this dangerous foe, that was
          creeping on in guise so insidious.</p>
  <p>"You have not said a word to me about the children,"
          exclaimed Lady Isabel, as she and her husband
          entered their rooms, Francis Levison not having been
          invited to enter. "Did they all send me some kisses?
          Did Archie send me any?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed: he was not a mother, he was only a
          father. Archie, with his year of age, send
          kisses!</p>
  <p>"Had you been away, as I am, he should have sent some to
          you," murmured Lady Isabel. "I would have taken a
          thousand from him, and told him they were for
          papa."</p>
  <p>"I will take a thousand back to him," answered Mr.
          Carlyle, folding his wife to his heart. "My dearest,
          the sight of you has made me glad."</p>
  <p>The following day was Sunday, and Francis Levison was
          asked to dine with them: the first meal he had been
          invited to in the house. After dinner, when Lady
          Isabel left them, he grew confidential with Mr.
          Carlyle; laying open all his intricate affairs and
          his cargo of troubles.</p>
  <p>"This compulsory exile abroad is becoming intolerable,"
            <pb n="316"/> he concluded; "and a Paris life
          plays the very deuce with one. Do you see any chance
          of my getting back to England?"</p>
  <p>"Not the least," was the candid answer: "unless you can
          manage to satisfy, or partially satisfy, these
          claims you have been telling me of. Will not Sir
          Peter assist you?"</p>
  <p>"I believe he would, were the case fairly represented to
          him; but how am I to-get over to do it? I have
          written several letters to him lately, and for some
          time I got no reply. Then came an epistle from Lady
          Levison; not short and sweet, but short and sour. It
          was to the effect that Sir Peter was ill, and could
          not at present be troubled with business
          matters."</p>
  <p>"He cannot be very ill," remarked Mr. Carlyle: "he passed
          through West Lynne in his open carriage a week
          ago."</p>
  <p>"He ought to help me," grumbled Captain Levison. "I am
          his heir, so long as Lady Levison does not give him
          one. I do not hear that she has expectations."</p>
  <p>"You should contrive to see him."</p>
  <p>"I know I should: but it is not possible, under present
          circumstances. With these thunder-clouds hanging
          over me, I dare not set foot in England, and run the
          risk of being dropped upon. I can stand a few
          things, but I shudder at the bare idea of a prison.
          Something peculiar in my idiosyncrasy I take it, for
          those, who have tried it, say that it's nothing when
          you're used to it."</p>
  <p>"Some one might see him for you."</p>
  <p>"Some one!—who? I have quarrelled with my lawyers, Sharp
          and Steel, of Lincoln's Inn."</p>
  <p>"Keen practitioners," put in Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <pb n="317"/>
  <p>"Too keen for me. I'd send them over the herringpond if I
          could. They have used me shamefully since my uncle's
          marriage. If ever I do come into the Levison
          estates, they'll be ready to eat their ears off:
          they would like a finger in the pie with such a
          property as that."</p>
  <p>"Shall I see Sir Peter Levison for you?"</p>
  <p>" <hi>Will</hi> you?" returned Captain Levison, his dark
          eyes lighting up.</p>
  <p>"If you like; as your friend, you understand; not as your
          solicitor: that, I should decline. I have a slight
          knowledge of Sir Peter; my father was well
          acquainted with him; and if I can render you any
          little service, I shall be happy, in return for your
          kind attention to my wife. I cannot promise to see
          him for these two or three weeks," resumed Mr.
          Carlyle, "for we are terribly busy. Otherwise I
          should be staying here with my wife."</p>
  <p>Francis Levison expressed his gratitude, and the
          prospect, however remote, of being enabled to return
          to England, increased his spirits to exultation.
          Whilst they continued to converse, Lady Isabel sat
          at the window in the adjoining room, listlessly
          looking out on the crowds of French, who were
          crowding to and from the port in their Sunday
          holiday attire. Looking at them with her eyes, not
          with her senses; her senses were holding commune
          with herself, and it was not altogether
          satisfactory. She was aware that a sensation all too
          warm, a feeling of attraction towards Francis
          Levison, was working within her; not a voluntary
          one; she could no more repress it than she could
          repress her own sense of being; and, mixed with it,
          was the stern voice of conscience, overwhelming her
          with the most <pb n="318"/> lively terror. She would
          have given all she possessed to be able to overcome
          it; she would have given half the years of her
          future life to separate herself at once and for ever
          from the man.</p>
  <p>But, do not mistake the word terror; or suppose that Lady
          Isabel Carlyle applied it here in the vulgar
          acceptation of the term. She did not fear for
          herself; none could be more securely conscious of
          their own rectitude of principle and conduct; and
          she would have believed it as impossible for her
          ever to forsake her duty as a wife, a gentlewoman,
          and a Christian, as for the sun to turn round from
          the west to the east. That was not the fear which
          possessed her; it had never presented itself to her
          mind: what she did fear was, that further
          companionship, especially lonely companionship, with
          Francis Levison might augment the sentiments she
          entertained for him to a height, that her life, for
          perhaps years to come, would be one of unhappiness
          and concealment: more than all, she shrank from the
          consciousness of the bitter wrong that these
          sentiments cast upon her husband.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, I have a favour to ask you," she timidly
          began, as they sat together after Captain Levison's
          departure. "You must promise to grant it me."</p>
  <p>"What is it?"</p>
  <p>"But that is not promising."</p>
  <p>"I will grant it, Isabel; if it be in my power."</p>
  <p>"I want you to remain with me for the rest of the time
          that I must stay here."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle looked at her in surprise. "My dear, how
          could you think of wishing anything so unlikely? It
          is circuit time."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald, you must remain!"</p>
  <pb n="319"/>
  <p>"I wish I could; but it is impossible; you must know it
          to be so, Isabel. A few weeks later in the year, and
          I could have stayed the whole of the time with you.
          As it is, I did not know how to get away for these
          two or three days."</p>
  <p>"And you go back to-morrow!"</p>
  <p>"Necessity has no law, my darling."</p>
  <p>"Then take me with you."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle smiled. "No, Isabel: not while I find the
          change is doing you so much good. I took these rooms
          for six weeks, you must remain certainly until the
          end of the term, if not longer."</p>
  <p>The colour came flowing painfully into her cheek. "I
          cannot stay without you, Archibald."</p>
  <p>"Tell me why," smiled Mr Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Tell him why! "I am so dull without you," was the best
          argument she could offer, but her voice faltered,
          for she felt that it would not be listened to.</p>
  <p>Neither was it. Mr. Carlyle left the following day, and
          when he was departing, commended his wife to the
          further attention of Captain Levison. Not the
          faintest suspicion that it might be unwise to do so
          ever crossed his mind. How should it? Perfectly
          correct and honourable himself, it never occurred to
          him that Captain Levison might be less so; and, as
          to his wife—he would fearlessly have left her alone
          with him, or with any one else, on a desert island,
          so entire was his confidence in her.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER III. QUITTING THE DANGER.</head>
  <p><hi>Lady Isabel</hi> was seated on one of the benches of
          the Petit Camp, as it is called, underneath the
          ramparts of the upper town. A week or ten days had
          passed away since the departure of Mr. Carlyle, and
          in her health there was a further visible
          improvement. In her strength, the change was almost
          beyond belief. She had walked from her home to the
          cemetery, had lingered there, reading the
          inscriptions on the English graves, and now on her
          departure sat down to rest. Tired, it must be owned,
          but not much more so than many a lady would be,
          rejoicing in rude health. Captain Levison was her
          companion, as he mostly was in her walks; shake him
          off, she could not. She had tried a few stratagems;
          going out on unusual hours, or choosing unfrequented
          routes; but he was sure to trace her steps and come
          upon her. Isabel thought he must watch: probably he
          did. She would not take <pb/> more decided steps, or
          say to him, you shall not join me: he might have
          asked for an explanation, and Isabel in her
          conscious state of feeling, avoided that, above all
          things. It will be but for a little time she
          reflected; I shall soon be gone, and leave him, I
          hope, for ever. But meanwhile, she felt that this
          prolonged intercourse with him was bringing its
          fruits; that her cheek blushed at his approach, her
          heart beat with something too like rapture. She
          tried to put it down: why did she not try to stop
          the breeze as it filled the sails of the passing
          vessels? It would not have been a more hopeless
          task.</p>
  <p>It was a still evening, cool for July, no sound was heard
          save the hum of the summer insects, and Lady Isabel
          sat in silence with her companion, her rebellious
          heart beating with a sense of its own happiness. But
          for the voice of conscience, strong within her; but
          for the sense of right and wrong; but for existing
          things; in short, but that she was a wife, she might
          have been content so to sit by his side for ever,
          never to wish to move, or to break the silence. Did
          he read her feelings? He told her, months
          afterwards, that he did: but it might have been only
          a vain boast.</p>
  <p>"Do you remember the evening, Lady Isabel, just such a
          one as this, that we all passed at Richmond?" he
          suddenly asked. "Your father, Mrs. Vane, you, I and
          others?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I remember it. We had spent a pleasant day: the two
          Miss Challoners were with us. You drove Mrs. Vane
          home, and I went with papa. You drove recklessly, I
          recollect, and Mrs. Vane said when we got home that
          you should never drive her again."</p>
  <p>"Which meant, not till the next time. Of all capricious,
          <pb/> vain, exacting women, Emma Vane was the worst;
          and Emma Mount Severn is no improvement upon it:
          she's a systematic flirt, and nothing better. I
          drove recklessly on purpose to put her in a fright,
          and pay her off."</p>
  <p>"What had she done to you?"</p>
  <p>"Put me in a rage. She had saddled herself upon me, when
          I wanted—I wished for another to be my
          companion."</p>
  <p>"Blanche Challoner."</p>
  <p>"Blanche Challoner!" echoed Captain Levison, in a mocking
          tone: "what did I care for Blanche Challoner?"</p>
  <p>Isabel remembered that he had been supposed in those days
          to care a great deal for Miss Blanche Challoner —a
          most lovely girl of seventeen. "Mrs. Vane used to
          accuse you of caring too much for her," she said,
          aloud.</p>
  <p>"She accused me of caring for some one else more than for
          Blanche Challoner," he significantly returned, "and
          for once her jealous surmises were not misplaced.
          No, Lady Isabel, it was not Blanche Challoner I
          wished to drive home. Could you not have given a
          better guess than that, at the time?" he added,
          turning to her.</p>
  <p>There was no mistaking the tone of his voice or the
          glance of his eye. Lady Isabel felt a crimson flush
          rising, and she turned her face away.</p>
  <p>"The past is gone, and cannot be recalled," he continued,
          "but we both played our cards like simpletons. If
          ever two beings were formed to love each other, you
          and I were. I sometimes thought you read my
          feelings—"</p>
  <p>Surprise had kept her silent, but she interrupted him
          now, haughtily enough.</p>
  <pb/>
  <p>"I must speak, Lady Isabel: a few words, and then I am
          silent for ever. I would have declared myself had I
          dared, but my uncertain position, my debts, my
          inability to keep a wife; weighed me down; and
          instead of appealing to Sir Peter, as I hoped to
          have done, for the means to assume a position that
          whould justify me in asking for Lord Mount Severn's
          daughter, I crushed my hopes within me, and suffered
          you to escape—"</p>
  <p>"I will not hear this, Captain Levison," she cried rising
          from her seat in anger.</p>
  <p>He touched her arm to place her on it again, "A single
          moment yet, I pray you. I have for long wished that
          you should know why I lost you, a loss that tells
          upon me yet. I have bitterly worked out my own folly
          since. I knew not how passionately I loved you,
          until you became the wife of another. Isabel, I love
          you passionately still."</p>
  <p>"How dare you to presume so to address me?"</p>
  <p>She spoke in a cold, dignified tone of hauteur, as it was
          her bounden duty to speak. But nevertheless she was
          conscious of an under-current of feeling, whispering
          that under other auspices the avowal would have
          brought to her heart the most intense bliss.</p>
  <p>"What I have said can do no harm now," resumed Captain
          Levison; "the time has gone by for it; for neither
          you nor I are likely to forget that you are a wife.
          We have each chosen our path in life, and must abide
          by it; the gulf between us is impassable; but the
          fault was mine. I ought to have avowed my affection,
          and not have suffered you to throw yourself away
          upon Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Throw myself away!" she indignantly uttered, roused to
          the retort. "Mr. Carlyle is my dear husband;
          esteemed, respected, beloved. I married him of my
          <pb/> own free choice, and I have never repented it;
          I have grown more attached to him day by day. Look
          at his noble nature, his noble form: what are
            <hi>you</hi> by his side? You forget yourself,
          Francis Levison."</p>
  <p>He bit his lips. "No, I do not."</p>
  <p>"You are talking to me as you have no right to talk," she
          exclaimed in her agitation. "Who, but you, would so
          insult me, or take advantage of my momentarily
          unprotected condition? Would you dare to do it, were
          Mr. Carlyle within reach? I wish you good evening,
          sir."</p>
  <p>She walked away as quickly as her tired frame would
          permit. Captain Levison strode after her. He took
          forcible possession of her hand, and placed it
          within his arm.</p>
  <p>"I pray you forgive and forget what has escaped me, Lady
          Isabel. Suffer me to be as before, the kind friend,
          the anxious brother, endeavouring to be of service
          to you in the absence of Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"It is what I have suffered you to be, looking upon you
          as—I may say—a relative," she coldly rejoined,
          withdrawing her hand from his contact. "Not else
          should I have permitted your incessant
          companionship: and this is how you have repaid it!
          My husband thanked you for your attention to me;
          could he have read what was in your false heart, he
          had offered you a different sort of thanks, I
          fancy."</p>
  <p>"I ask you for pardon, Lady Isabel; I have acknowledged
          my fault; and I can do no more. I will not so offend
          again: but there are moments when our dearest
          feelings break through the rules of life, and betray
          themselves, in spite of our sober judgment. Suffer
          me to support you down this steep hill," he <pb/>
          added, for they were then going over the sharp
          stones of the Grande Rue; "you are not strong enough
          to proceed alone, after this evening's long
          walk."</p>
  <p>"You should have thought of that before," she said, some
          sarcasm in her tone. "No. I have declined."</p>
  <p>So he had to put his arm back, which he was holding out,
          and she walked on unsupported, with what strength
          she had, he continuing to walk by her side. Arrived
          at her own door, she wished him a cold good evening,
          and he turned away in the direction of his
          hotel.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel brushed past Peter, and flew up-stairs,
          startling Wilson, who had taken possession of the
          drawing-room to air her smart cap at its windows in
          the absence of her lady.</p>
  <p>"My desk, Wilson, immediately," cried she, tearing off
          her gloves, her bonnet, and her shawl. "Tell Peter
          to be in readiness to take a letter to the post; and
          he must walk fast, or he will not catch it before
          the English mail is closed."</p>
  <p>The symptoms of sinful happiness throbbing at her heart
          while Francis Levison told her of his love, spoke
          plainly to Lady Isabel of the expediency of
          withdrawing entirely from his society and his
          dangerous sophistries; she would be away from the
          very place that contained him; put the sea between
          them. So she dashed off a letter to her husband; an
          urgent summons that he should come for her without
          delay, for, remain away longer, she <hi>would
            not</hi> . It is probable she would have started
          alone, not waiting for Mr. Carlyle, but for fear of
          not having sufficient funds for the journey, after
          the rent and other things were paid.</p>
  <pb/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, when he received the letter and marked its
          earnest tone, wondered much. In reply, he stated he
          would be with her on the following Saturday, and
          then her returning, or not, with him could be
          settled. Fully determined not to meet Captain
          Levison, Isabel, in the intervening days, only went
          out in a carriage. He called once, and was shown
          into the drawing-room: but Lady Isabel, who happened
          to be in her own chamber, sent out a message, which
          was delivered by Peter. "My lady's compliments, but
          she must decline receiving visitors."</p>
  <p>Sunday morning—it had been impossible for him to get away
          before—brought Mr. Carlyle. He strongly combated her
          wish to return home until the six weeks should have
          expired, he nearly said he would not take her, and
          she grew earnest over it, almost to agitation.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," he said, "let me know your motive, for it
          appears to me that you have one. The sojourn here is
          evidently doing you a vast deal of good, and what
          you urge about 'being dull,' sounds very like
          nonsense. Tell me what it is."</p>
  <p>A sudden impulse flashed over her that she <hi>would</hi>
          tell him; the truth. Not tell him that she loved
          Francis Levison, or that he had spoken to her as he
          did: she valued her husband too greatly to draw him
          into any unpleasantness whose end could not be seen:
          but own to him that she had once felt a passing
          fancy for Francis Levison, and preferred not to be
          subjected to his companionship now. Oh, that she had
          done so! her kind, her noble, her judicious husband!
          Why did she not? The whole truth, as to her present
          feelings, it was not expedient that she should tell,
          but she might have confided to him quite sufficient.
          He would only have <pb/> cherished her the more
          deeply, and sheltered her under his fostering care,
          safe from harm.</p>
  <p>Why did she not? In the impulse of the moment she was
          about to do so, when Mr. Carlyle, who had been
          taking a letter from his pocket-book, put it into
          her hand. Upon what slight threads do the events of
          life turn! Her thoughts diverted, she remained
          silent while she opened the letter. It was from Miss
          Carlyle, who had handed it to her brother in the
          moment of his departure, to carry to Lady Isabel and
          save postage. Mr. Carlyle had nearly dropped it into
          the Folkestone post-office.</p>
  <p>A letter as stiff as Miss Corny herself. The children
          were well, and the house was going on well, and she
          hoped Lady Isabel was better. It filled three sides
          of note-paper, but that was all the news it
          contained, and it wound up with the following
          sentence: "I would continue my epistle, but Barbara
          Hare, who is to spend the day with us, has just
          arrived."</p>
  <p>Barbara Hare spending the day at East Lynne! That item
          was quite enough for Lady Isabel; and her heart and
          her confidence closed to her husband. She must go
          home to her children, she urged; she could not
          remain longer away from them; and she urged it at
          length with tears.</p>
  <p>"Nay, Isabel," said Mr. Carlyle, "if you are so much in
          earnest as this, you shall certainly go back with
          me."</p>
  <p>Then she was like a child let loose from school. She
          laughed; she danced in her excess of content; she
          showered kisses on her husband, thanking him in her
          gleeful gratitude. Mr. Carlyle set it down to her
          love for him: he arrived at the conclusion that, in
          reiterating <pb/> that she could not bear to be away
          from him, she spoke the fond truth.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," he said, smiling tenderly upon her, "do you
          remember, in the first days of our marriage, you
          told me you did not love me, but that the love would
          come. I think this is it."</p>
  <p>Her face flushed nearly to tears at the word; a bright,
          glowing, all too conscious flush. Mr. Carlyle
          mistook its source, and caught her to his heart.</p>
  <p>One day more, and then they—she and that man— should be
          separated by the broad sea! The thought caused her
          to lift up her heart in thankfulness. She knew that
          to leave him would be as though she left the sun
          behind her, that the other side might for a time be
          somewhat dreary; nevertheless, she fervently thanked
          Heaven. Oh, reader! never doubt the principles of
          poor Lady Isabel, her rectitude of mind, her wish
          and endeavour to do right, her abhorrence of wrong;
          her spirit was earnest and true, her intentions were
          pure.</p>
  <p>Captain Levison paid a visit to Mr. Carlyle, and inquired
          if he had had time to see Sir Peter. Not yet; Mr.
          Carlyle had been too busy to think of it; but he
          should soon have more leisure on his hands, and
          would not fail him. Such was the reply; the reply of
          an honourable man to a man of dishonour: but, of the
          dishonour, Mr. Carlyle suspected nothing. It is a
          pity but what bad men could be turned inside out
          sometimes: to put others on their guard.</p>
  <p>It was high water in the afternoon, and the Folkestone
          boat was announced to start at one. The Carlyles and
          their servants went on board in good time, and
          Captain Levison greeted them and said farewell as
          they stepped <pb n="10"/> on the steamer. Lady
          Isabel took her seat on the deck, her husband
          standing by her; the cords were unloosened, and the
          boat moved slowly down the harbour. On the shore
          stood Francis Levison, watching its progress,
          watching <hi>her</hi> . He was a bold, unscrupulous
          man; and there was little doubt that the more
          refined feelings, both of the past and present, he
          had thought fit to avow for Lady Isabel, were all
          put on, meant to serve a purpose. However, he had
          received his checkmate.</p>
  <p>As he receded from Isabel's view, a sensation of relief
          thrilled through her whole frame, causing it to
          shudder, and involuntarily she clasped the hand of
          Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"You are not cold, Isabel?" he said, bending over
          her.</p>
  <p>"Oh no: I am very comfortable; very happy."</p>
  <p>"But you were surely shivering?"</p>
  <p>"At the thought of what I could have done with myself,
          had you come away and left me there still, all
          alone. Archibald," she continued, in an impassioned
          whisper, "never let me go from you again; keep me by
          you always."</p>
  <p>He smiled as he looked down into her pleading eyes, and a
          whole world of tender response and love might be
          detected in his earnest tone. "Always and always,
          Isabel. It is greater pain to me than to you, to
          have you away from me."</p>
  <p>How could she ever doubt him?</p>
  <pb n="11"/>
                                </div>

  <head>CHAPTER IV. THE FRACTURED ANKLE.</head>
  <p><hi>Lady Isabel</hi> had returned home to bodily health,
          to the delight of meeting her children, to the glad
          sensation of security. But, as the days went on, a
          miserable feeling of apathy stole over her: a
          feeling as if all whom she had loved in the world
          had died, leaving her living and alone. It was a
          painful depression, the vacuum in her heart which
          was making itself felt in its keen intensity. She
          strove to drive that bad man away from her thoughts;
          but, even while she so strove, he was again in them.
          Too frequently she caught herself thinking that if
          she could but see him once again, for ever so short
          a period, one hour, one day, she could compose her
          spirit afterwards to rest. She did not encourage
          these reflections: from what you know of her, you
          may be sure of that: but they thrust themselves
          continually forward. The form of Francis Levison was
          ever present to her; not a minute of the day but it
          gave the colouring to her thoughts, and at night it
          made the subject of her dreams. Oh, those dreams!
          they were painful to awake from; painful from the
          contrast they presented to reality; and equally
          painful to her conscience, in its strife after what
          was right. She would have given much not to have
          these dreams; never to see or think of him <pb n="12"/> in her sleep. But, how prevent it? There
          was no prevention: for when the mind (or, the
          imagination, if you like the word better) is
          thoroughly imbued with a subject of this nature,
          especially if unhappiness mingles with it, then the
          dreams follow necessarily the bent of the waking
          thoughts. Poor Lady Isabel would awake to
          self-reproach, restless and feverish; wishing that
          this terrible disease could be driven away, root and
          branch: but Time, the great healer, must, she knew,
          pass over her, before that could be.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle mounted his horse one morning and rode over
          to Levison Park. He asked for Sir Peter, but was
          shown into the presence of Lady Levison: a young and
          pretty woman, dressed showily. She inquired his
          business.</p>
  <p>"My business, madam, is with Sir Peter."</p>
  <p>"But Sir Peter is not well enough to attend to business.
          It upsets him; worries him."</p>
  <p>"Nevertheless I am here by his own appointment. Twelve
          o'clock, he mentioned; and the hour has barely
          struck."</p>
  <p>Lady Levison bit her lip and bowed coldly; and at that
          moment a servant appeared to conduct Mr. Carlyle to
          Sir Peter. The matter which had taken Mr. Carlyle
          thither was entered upon immediately—Francis
          Levison, his debts, and his gracelessness. Sir
          Peter, an old gentleman in a velvet skull-cap,
          particularly enlarged upon the latter.</p>
  <p>"I would pay his debts to-day and set him upon his legs
          again, but that I know I should have to do the same
          thing over and over again to the end of the
          chapter—as I have done before," cried Sir Peter.
          "His grandfather was my only brother, his father my
          dutiful <pb n="13"/> and beloved nephew; but he is
          just as bad as they were estimable. He is a
          worthless fellow, and nothing else, Mr.
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"His tale drew forth my compassion, and I promised I
          would see you and speak for him," returned Mr.
          Carlyle. "Of Captain Levison's personal virtues or
          vices I know nothing."</p>
  <p>"And the less you know, the better," growled Sir Peter.
          "I suppose he wants me to clear him and start him
          afresh."</p>
  <p>"Something of the sort, I conclude."</p>
  <p>"But how is it to be done? I am at home, and he is over
          there. His affairs are in a state of confusion, and
          nobody can come to the bottom of them without an
          explanation from him. Some liabilities, for which I
          have furnished the money, the creditors swear have
          not yet been liquidated. He must come over if he
          wants anything done."</p>
  <p>"Where is he to come to? He must be in England <hi>sub
            rosá</hi> ."</p>
  <p>"He can't be here," hastily rejoined Sir Peter. "Lady
          Levison would not have him for a day."</p>
  <p>"He might be at East Lynne," good-naturedly observed Mr.
          Carlyle. "Nobody would think of looking for him
          there. I think it is a pity that you should not
          meet, if you do feel inclined to help him."</p>
  <p>"You are a great deal more considerate to him than he
          deserves, Mr. Carlyle. May I ask if you intend to
          act for him in a professional capacity?"</p>
  <p>"I do not."</p>
  <p>A few more words, and it was decided that Captain Levison
          should be immediately sent for. As Mr. Carlyle <pb n="14"/> left Sir Peter's presence, he encountered
          Lady Levison.</p>
  <p>"I can scarcely be ignorant that your conference with my
          husband has reference to his grand-nephew," she
          observed.</p>
  <p>"It has," replied Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I have a very bad opinion of him, Mr. Carlyle: at the
          same time I do not wish you to carry away a wrong
          impression of me. Francis Levison is my husband's
          nephew, his presumptive heir; it may therefore
          appear strange that I set my face so determinately
          against him. Two or three years ago, previous to my
          marriage with Sir Peter, in fact before I knew Sir
          Peter, I was brought into contact with Francis
          Levison. He was acquainted with some friends of
          mine, and at their house I met him. He behaved
          shamefully ill; he repaid their hospitality with
          gross ingratitude: other details and facts,
          regarding his conduct, also became known to me.
          Altogether, I believe him to be a base and
          despicable man, both by nature and by inclination,
          and that he will remain such to the end of
          time."</p>
  <p>"I know very little indeed of him," observed Mr. Carlyle.
          "May I inquire the nature of his ill conduct in the
          instance you mention?"</p>
  <p>"He ruined them. He ruined them, Mr. Carlyle. They were
          simple, unsuspicious country people, understanding
          neither fraud nor vice, nor the ways of an evil
          world. Francis Levison got them to put their names
          to bills, 'as a simple matter of form, to
          accommodate him for a month or so,' he stated, and
          so they believed. They were not wealthy: they lived
          upon their own small estate in comfort. but with no
          superfluous money to spare, and when the time came
          for them to pay—as <pb n="15"/> come it did—it
          brought ruin, and they had to leave their home. He
          deliberately did it: I am certain that Francis
          Levison deliberately did it, knowing what would be
          the end. And I could tell you of other things. Sir
          Peter may have informed you that I object to receive
          him here. I do. My objection is to the man, to his
          character; not owing, as I hear it has been said, to
          any jealous, paltry feeling touching his being the
          heir. I must lose my own self-respect before I admit
          Francis Levison to my house, an inmate. Sir Peter
          may assist him and welcome, may pay his debts and
          get him out of his scrapes as often as he pleases;
          but I will not have him here."</p>
  <p>"Sir Peter said you declined to receive him. But it is
          necessary he should come to England—if his affairs
          are to be set straight—and also that he should see
          Sir Peter."</p>
  <p>"Come to England?" interrupted Lady Levison. "How can he
          come to England under present circumstances? Unless,
          indeed, he comes <hi>en cachette</hi> ."</p>
  <p>" <hi>En cachette</hi> of course," replied Mr. Carlyle.
          "There is no other way. I have offered to let him
          stay at East Lynne: he is, you may be aware, a
          connexion of Lady Isabel's."</p>
  <p>"Take care that he does not repay <hi>your</hi>
          hospitality with ingratitude," warmly returned Lady
          Levison. "It would only be in accordance with his
          practice."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed. "I do not well see what harm he
          could do me, allowing that he had the inclination.
          He would not scare my clients from me; nor beat my
          children; and I can take care of my pocket. A few
          days, no doubt, will be the extent of his
          sojourn."</p>
  <p>Lady Levison smiled too, and shook hands with Mr. <pb n="16"/> Carlyle. "In your house perhaps there may
          be no field for his vagaries; but rely upon it,
          where there is one, he is sure to be at some
          mischief or other."</p>
  <p>This visit of Mr. Carlyle's to Levison Park took place on
          a Friday morning, and on his return to his office he
          despatched an account of it to Captain levison at
          Boulogne, telling him to come over. But Mr. Carlyle,
          like many another man whose brain has its sharè of
          work, was sometimes forgetful of trifles, and it
          entirely slipped his memory to mention the expected
          arrival at home. The following evening, Saturday, he
          and Lady Isabel were dining in the neighbourhood,
          when the conversation at table turned upon the
          Ducies and their embarrassments. The association of
          ideas led Mr. Carlyle's thoughts to Boulogne, to
          Captain Levison and <hi>his</hi> embarrassments, and
          it immediately occurred to him that he had not told
          his wife of the anticipated visit. He kept it in his
          mind, and spoke as soon as they were in the chariot
          returning home.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," he began, "I suppose we have always rooms ready
          for visitors. Because I am expecting one."</p>
  <p>"Oh yes. Or, if not, they are soon made ready."</p>
  <p>"Ay, but to-morrow is Sunday, and I have no doubt that it
          is the day he will take advantage of to come. I am
          sorry I forgot to mention it yesterday."</p>
  <p>"Who is coming?"</p>
  <p>"Captain Levison."</p>
  <p>"Who?" repeated Lady Isabel, in a sharp tone of
          consternation.</p>
  <p>"Captain Levison. Sir Peter consents to see him, with a
          view to the settlement of his liabilities, but Lady
          Levison declines to receive him at the park. So I
            <pb n="17"/> offered to give him house room at
          East Lynne for a few days."</p>
  <p>There is an old saying—the heart leaping into the mouth;
          and Lady Isabel's heart leaped into hers. She grew
          dizzy at the words; her senses seemed for the moment
          to desert her: her first sensation was as if the
          dull earth had opened and shown her a way into
          paradise; her second, was a lively consciousness
          that Francis Levison ought not to be suffered to
          come again into companionship with her. Mr. Carlyle
          continued to converse of the man's embarrassments,
          of his own interview with Sir Peter, of Lady
          Levison; but Isabel was as one who heard not. She
          was debating the question, how could she prevent his
          coming?</p>
  <p>"Archibald," she presently said, "I do not wish Francis
          Levison to stay at East Lynne."</p>
  <p>"It will only be for a few days: perhaps but a day or
          two. Sir Peter is in the humour to discharge the
          claims; and, the moment his resolve is know, the
          ex-captain can walk on her Majesty's dominions, an
          unmolested man; free to go where he will."</p>
  <p>"That may be," interrupted Lady Isabel, in an accent of
          impatience, "but why should he come to our
          house?"</p>
  <p>"I proposed it myself. I had no idea you would dislike
          his coming. Why should you?"</p>
  <p>"I don't like Francis Levison," she murmured. "That is, I
          don't care to have him at East Lynne."</p>
  <p>"My dear, I fear there is no help for it now: he is most
          likely on his road, and will arrive to-morrow: I
          cannot turn him out again, after my own voluntary
          invitation. Had I known it would be disagreeable to
          you, I should not have proposed it."</p>
  <pb n="18"/>
  <p>"To-morrow!" she exclaimed, all of the words that caught
          her ear; "is he coming to-morrow?"</p>
  <p>"Being Sunday, a free day, he will be sure to take
          advantage of it. What has he done, that you should
          object to his coming? You did not say in Boulogne
          that you disliked him."</p>
  <p>"He has done nothing," was her faltering answer, feeling
          that her grounds of opposition must melt under her,
          one by one.</p>
  <p>"Lady Levison appears to possess a very ill opinion of
          him," resumed Mr. Carlyle. "She says she knew him in
          years gone by. She mentioned one or two things
          which, if true, were bad enough: but possibly she
          may be prejudiced."</p>
  <p>"She is prejudiced," said Isabel. "At least, so Francis
          Levison told me in Boulogne. There appeared to be no
          love lost between them."</p>
  <p>"At any rate, his ill doings or well doings cannot affect
          us for the short period he is likely to remain. You
          have taken a prejudice against him also, I suppose,
          Isabel."</p>
  <p>She suffered Mr. Carlyle to remain in the belief, and sat
          with clasped hands and a despairing spirit, feeling
          that fate was against her. How could she accomplish
          her task of forgetting this man, if he was thus to
          be thrown into her home and her companionship?
          Suddenly she turned to her husband, and laid her
          cheek upon his shoulder.</p>
  <p>He thought she was tired. He passed his arm round her
          waist, drew her face to a more comfortable position,
          and bent his own lovingly upon it. It came into her
          mind as she lay there, to tell him a portion of the
          truth, like it had done once before. It was a strong
            <pb n="19"/> arm of shelter round her; a powerful
          pillar of protection, him upon whom she leaned; why
          did she not confide herself to him as trustingly as
          a little child? Simply because her courage failed.
          Once, twice, the opening words were upon her lips,
          but come forth they did not; and then the carriage
          stopped at East Lynne, and the opportunity was over.
          Oh, how many a time, in her after years, did Lady
          Isabel recall that midnight drive with her husband,
          and wish, in her vain repentance, that she had
          opened his eyes to that dangerous man!</p>
  <p>The following morning proved a wet one, but it cleared up
          in the middle of the day. In the afternoon, however,
          whilst they were at church, the rain came on
          again.</p>
  <p>"Cornelia," whispered Mr. Carlyle, getting near to his
          sister when service was over, "it is raining
          heavily: you had better return with us in the pony
          carriage. John can walk."</p>
  <p>Not she. Had it poured cats and dogs Miss Carlyle would
          not have gone to or from church otherwise than on
          her two legs, and off she started with her large
          umbrella. Mr. Carlyle and Isabel soon passed her,
          striding along the footpath, and some of the
          servants behind her. <hi>Not</hi> in attendance upon
          Miss Carlyle: she would have scorned such attendance
          worse than she scorned the pony carriage. No matter
          what might be the weather, this adventurous lady
          would be seen pushing through it: through the
          summer's heat and the winter's snow; through the
          soft shower and the impetuous storm; the great
          umbrella (it might have covered any moderate-sized
          haystack) her nearly constant companion, for Miss
          Corny was one of those <pb n="20"/> prudent spirits
          who like to be prepared for contingencies and be on
          the safe side; those who act up to the maxim "When
          it's fine, take an umbrella; when it rains, do as
          you like." In fine weather she chose the pathway
          through the fields, but not in wet, the damp grass
          not agreeing with her petticoats.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle had driven in at the gates and was winding up
          the avenue, when sounds of distress were heard, and
          they saw little Isabel flying towards them from the
          slopes, crying and sobbing in the greatest
          agitation. Mr. Carlyle jumped out and met the
          child.</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa, papa! oh come, pray come! I think she is
          dead."</p>
  <p>He took the child in his arms to soothe her. "Hush, my
          little darling, you will alarm mamma. Don't tremble
          so. Tell me what it is."</p>
  <p>Isabel told her tale. She had been a naughty child, she
          freely confessed, and had run out in the rain for
          fun because Joyce told her not, she had run amidst
          the wet grass of the park, down the slopes, Joyce
          after her. And Joyce had slipped and was lying at
          the foot of the slopes with a white face, never
          moving.</p>
  <p>"Take care of her, Isabel," said Mr. Carlyle, placing the
          agitated and repentant child by his wife's side.
          "She says Joyce has fallen by the slopes. No, do not
          come: I will go first and see what is amiss."</p>
  <p>Joyce was lying just as she fell, at the foot of the
          slopes. But her eyes were open now, and if she had
          fainted—as might be inferred from the little girl's
          words—she had recovered consciousness.</p>
  <p>"Oh, master, don't try to move me! I fear my leg is
          broken."</p>
  <p>He did, however, essay gently to raise her, but she <pb n="21"/> screamed with the pain, and he found he
          must wait for assistance. "I trust you are not much
          hurt," he kindly said. "How did it happen?"</p>
  <p>"Miss Isabel ran out, sir, in all the rain and wet, and I
          went after her to bring her back again. But the
          slopes are slippery, and down I went, and just at
          first I remembered nothing more."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle despatched John and the pony carriage back
          for Mr. Wainwright, and with the aid of the
          servants, who were soon up from church, Joyce was
          carried in and laid on a bed, dressed as she was.
          Mr. Carlyle and Lady Isabel remained with her. Miss
          Carlyle also was there, fidgeting and banging about,
          getting things ready that she fancied might be
          wanted, and pressing cordials upon Joyce which the
          latter could not take. Miss Carlyle's frame of mind,
          between sympathy and anger, was rather an explosive
          one: altogether, she did more harm than good. Little
          Isabel stole in, and drew her mother away from the
          bed.</p>
  <p>"Mamma," she whispered, "there is a strange gentleman
          down stairs. He came in a chaise. He has got a
          portmanteau, and he is asking for you and papa."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel turned sick with apprehension: was he really
          come?</p>
  <p>"Who is it, Isabel?" she said, by way of making some
          answer: she guessed but too well.</p>
  <p>"I don't know. I don't like him, mamma. He laid hold of
          me and held me tight, and there was an ugly look in
          his eyes."</p>
  <p>"Go round the bed and tell your papa that a stranger is
          down stairs," said Lady Isabel.</p>
  <pb n="22"/>
  <p>"Mamma," shivered the child, before she stirred to obey,
          "will Joyce die?"</p>
  <p>"No, dear; I hope not."</p>
  <p>"Because you know it will be my fault. Oh, mamma, I am so
          sorry! what can I do?"</p>
  <p>"Hush! If you sob, it will make Joyce worse. Go and
          whisper to papa about the gentleman."</p>
  <p>"But will Joyce ever forgive me?"</p>
  <p>"She has forgiven you already, I am sure, Isabel, but you
          must be all the more obedient to her for the future.
          Go to papa, my dear, as I tell you."</p>
  <p>The stranger was of course Captain Levison. Mr. Carlyle
          went down to receive and entertain him. Lady Isabel
          did not: the accident to her maid being put forth as
          an excuse.</p>
  <p>Mr. Wainwright pronounced the injury to be a simple
          fracture of the ankle-bone. It might have been much
          worse, he observed: but Joyce would be confined to
          her bed for three or four weeks.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," whispered Isabel, "I'll come and read my
          Bible-stories to you always; always and always: I
          know mamma will let me, and then you won't be dull.
          And there's that beautiful new book of fairy tales
          with the pictures; you'll like to hear them: there's
          about a princess who was locked up in a castle with
          nothing to eat."</p>
  <p>Joyce faintly smiled, and took the child's eager little
          hand in hers.</p>
  <p>Later in the evening, Isabel and William were in the room
          with Mr. Carlyle. "There are fine children,"
          observed Francis Levison. "Beautiful faces!"</p>
  <p>"They resemble their mother much, I think," was <pb n="23"/> the reply of Mr. Carlyle. "She was a very
          lovely child."</p>
  <p>"Did you know Lady Isabel as a child?" inquired Francis
          Levison, some surprise in his tone.</p>
  <p>"I frequently saw her. She used to stay here with Lady
          Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"Ah, by the way, this place was Mount Severn's property
          then. What a reckless man he was! Young lady, I must
          take possession of you," continued Captain Levison,
          extending his hand and pulling Isabel towards him.
          "You ran away from me when I first came, and would
          not tell me what your name was."</p>
  <p>"I ran away to tell mamma that you were come. She was
          with Joyce."</p>
  <p>"Joyce! Who is Joyce?"</p>
  <p>"Lady Isabel's maid," interposed Mr. Carlyle. "The one to
          whom, as I told you, the accident had just happened.
          A particularly valued servant in our family, is
          Joyce."</p>
  <p>"It is a curious name," remarked Captain Levison.
          "Joyce—Joyce! I never heard such a name. Is it a
          christian or surname?"</p>
  <p>"She was baptised Joyce. It is not so very uncommon. Her
          name is Joyce Hallijohn. She has been with us
          several years."</p>
  <p>At this moment, Isabel, having been trying in vain to
          escape from Captain Levison, burst into tears. Mr.
          Carlyle inquired what was amiss.</p>
  <p>"I don't like him to hold me," was the response of Miss
          Isabel, ignoring ceremony.</p>
  <p>Captain Levison laughed, and held her tighter. But Mr.
          Carlyle rose, and with quiet authority drew away the
          child, and placed her on his own knee. She hid <pb n="24"/> her face upon him, and put up her little
          hand round his neck.</p>
  <p>"Papa, I don't like him," she whispered softly; "I am
          afraid of him. Don't let him take me again."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle's only answer was to press her to him. "You
          are not accustomed to children, Captain Levison," he
          observed. "They are curious little plants to deal
          with, capricious and sensitive."</p>
  <p>"They must be a great worry," was the rejoinder. "This
          accident to your servant must be a serious one. It
          will confine her to her bed for some time, I
          presume?"</p>
  <p>"For weeks, the doctor says. And no possibility of her
          getting up from it."</p>
  <p>Captain Levison rose, and caught hold of William in
          apparent glee, and swung him round. The boy laughed,
          unlike his sister, and seemed to enjoy the fun.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER V. MRS. HARE'S DREAM.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> next day rose bright, warm, and cloudless,
          and the morning sun streamed into the bed-room of
          Mrs. Hare. That lady lay in bed, a flush on her
          delicate cheeks, and her soft eyes rather
          glistening, as if with a touch of fever. The
          justice, in a cotton nightcap with a little perky
          tassel, sat on a chair tying his drawers at the
          knee, preparatory to inducting his legs into his
          pantaloons—if any single damsel in years, who may
          read this, will forgive this slight revelation as to
          the mysteries of a gentleman's toilette. The
          pantaloons assumed, and the braces fastened, the
          justice threw his nightcap on to the bed and went up
          to the wash-hand-stand, where he splashed away for a
          few minutes at his face and hands: he never shaved
          till after breakfast. Mr. and Mrs. Hare were of the
          old-fashioned class who know nothing about
          dressing-rooms; their bed-room was very large, and
          they had never used a dressing-room in their lives,
          or found the want of one. The justice rubbed his
          face to a shiny brilliancy, settled on his morning
          wig and his dressing-gown, and then turned to the
          bed.</p>
  <p>"What will you have for breakfast?"</p>
  <p>"Thank you, Richard, I do not think that I can <pb n="26"/> eat anything. I shall be glad of my tea; I am
          very thirsty."</p>
  <p>"All nonsense," responded the justice, alluding to the
          intimation of not eating. "Have a poached egg."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare smiled at him and gently shook her head. "You
          are very kind, Richard, but I could not eat it this
          morning. Barbara may send up the smallest bit of dry
          toast."</p>
  <p>"My belief is, that you just <hi>give way</hi> to this
          notion of feeling ill, Anne," cried the justice.
          "It's half fancy, I know. If you'd get up and shake
          it off, and come down, you would relish your
          breakfast and be set up for the day. Whereas you lie
          here, take nothing but some trashy tea, and get up
          afterwards weak, shaky, and fit for nothing."</p>
  <p>"It is ever so many weeks, Richard, since I lay in bed to
          breakfast," remonstrated poor Mrs. Hare. "I really
          don't think I have once, since—since the
          spring."</p>
  <p>"And have been all the better for it."</p>
  <p>"But indeed I am not equal to getting up this morning.
          Would you please to throw this window open before
          you go down: I should like to feel the air."</p>
  <p>"You will get the air too near from this window," replied
          Mr. Justice Hare, opening the further one. Had his
          wife requested that further one to be opened, he
          would have opened the other: his own will and
          opinions were ever paramount. Then he descended.</p>
  <p>A minute or two, and up ran Barbara, looking bright and
          fair as the morning, her pink muslin dress with its
          ribbons and its open white lace sleeves as pretty as
          she was. She leaned over to kiss her mother.</p>
  <p>Barbara had grown more gentle and tender of late years,
          the bitterness of her pain had passed away, leaving
            <pb n="27"/> all that had been good in her love to
          mellow and fertilize her nature. Her character had
          been greatly improved by sorrow.</p>
  <p>"Mamma, are you ill? And you have been so well lately;
          you went to bed so well last night! Papa says—"</p>
  <p>"Barbara dear," interrupted Mrs. Hare, glancing round the
          room with dread, and speaking in a deep whisper, "I
          have had one of those dreadful dreams again."</p>
  <p>"Oh, mamma, how <hi>can</hi> you!" exclaimed Barbara,
          starting up in vexation. "How can you suffer a
          foolish dream so to overcome you as to make you ill?
          You have good sense in other matters; but, in this,
          you seem to put all sense away from you."</p>
  <p>"Child, will you tell me how I am to help it?" returned
          Mrs. Hare, taking Barbara's hand and drawing her to
          her again. "I do not give myself the dreams; I
          cannot prevent their making me sick, prostrate,
          feverish. I was as well yesterday as I could be; I
          went to bed quite comfortable, in excellent spirits;
          I do not know that I had even once thought of poor
          Richard during the day. And yet the dream came.
          There were no circumstances to lead to or induce it,
          either in my thoughts or in outward facts; but, come
          it did. How can I help these things, I ask?"</p>
  <p>"And it is so long since you had one of these
          disagreeable dreams! Why, how long is it,
          mamma?"</p>
  <p>"So long, Barbara, that the dread of them had nearly left
          me. I scarcely think I have had one since that
          stolen visit of Richard's, years ago."</p>
  <p>"Was it a very bad dream, mamma?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, child, yes. I dreamt that the real murderer <pb n="28"/> came to West Lynne: that he was with us
          here, and we—"</p>
  <p>At this moment the bed-room door was flung open, and the
          face of the justice, especially stern and cross
          then, was pushed in. So startled was Mrs. Hare, that
          she shook till she shook the pillow, and Barbara
          sprang away from the bed. Surely he had not
          distinguished their topic of conversation!</p>
  <p>"Are you coming to make breakfast to-day, or not,
          Barbara? Do you expect me to make it?"</p>
  <p>"She is coming this instant, Richard," said Mrs. Hare,
          her voice more faint than usual. And the justice
          turned and stamped down again.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, could your papa have heard me mention
          Richard?"</p>
  <p>"No, no, mamma, impossible; the door was shut. I will
          bring up your breakfast myself, and then you can
          tell me about the dream."</p>
  <p>Barbara flew after Mr. Hare, poured out his coffee, saw
          him settled at his breakfast, with a plateful of
          grouse-pie before him, and then returned up-stairs
          with her mamma's tea and dry toast.</p>
  <p>"Go on with the dream, mamma," she said.</p>
  <p>"But your own breakfast will be cold, child."</p>
  <p>"Oh, I don't mind that. Did you dream of Richard?"</p>
  <p>"Not very much of Richard: except that the old and
          continuous trouble, of his being away and unable to
          return, seemed to pervade it all through. You
          remember, Barbara, Richard asserted to us, in that
          short, hidden night visit, that he did not commit
          the murder; that it was another who did?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I remember it," replied Barbara.</p>
  <pb n="29"/>
  <p>"Barbara, I am convinced he spoke the truth: I trust him
          implicitly."</p>
  <p>"I feel sure of it also, mamma."</p>
  <p>"I asked him, you may remember, whether it was Otway
          Bethel who committed it; for I have always doubted
          Bethel in an indefinite, vague manner: Richard
          replied it was not Bethel, but a stranger. Well,
          Barbara, in my dream I thought that stranger came to
          West Lynne, that he came to this house, here, and we
          were talking to him of it, conversing as we might
          with any other visitor. Mind you, we seemed to
            <hi>know</hi> that he was the one who actually did
          it; but he denied it; he wanted to put it upon
          Richard: and I saw him—yes I did, Barbara—whisper to
          Otway Bethel. But oh, I cannot tell you the
          sickening horror that was upon me throughout, and
          seemed to be upon you also, lest he should make good
          his own apparent innocence, and crush Richard, his
          victim. I think the dread and horror awoke me."</p>
  <p>"What was this stranger like?" asked Barbara, in a low
          tone.</p>
  <p>"Well, I cannot quite tell you: the recollection of his
          appearance seemed to pass away from me with the
          dream. He was dressed as a gentleman, and we
          conversed with him as an equal."</p>
  <p>Barbara's mind was full of Captain Thorn; but his name
          had not been mentioned to Mrs. Hare, neither would
          she mention it now. She fell into deep thought, and
          Mrs. Hare had to speak twice before she could be
          aroused.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, I say, don't you think that this dream, coming
          uncalled for, uninduced, must forebode some <pb n="30"/> ill? Rely upon it, something connected
          with that wretched murder is going to be stirred up
          again."</p>
  <p>"You know, mamma, I do not believe in dreams," was
          Barbara's answer. "I think when people say 'this
          dream is a sign of such and such a thing,' it is the
          greatest absurdity in the world. I wish you could
          remember what the man was like in your dream."</p>
  <p>"I wish I could," answered Mrs. Hare, breaking off a
          particle of her dry toast. "All I remember is, that
          he appeared to be a gentleman."</p>
  <p>"Was he tall? Had he black hair?"</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare shook her head. "I tell you, my dear, the
          remembrance has passed from me; so, whether his hair
          was black or light, I cannot say. I think he was
          tall: but he was sitting down, and Otway Bethel
          stood behind his chair. I seemed to feel that
          Richard was outside the door, in hiding, trembling
          lest the man should go out and see him there; and I
          trembled too. Oh, Barbara, it was a distressing
          dream!"</p>
  <p>"I wish you could avoid having them, mamma, for they seem
          to upset you very much."</p>
  <p>"Why did you ask whether the man was tall, and had black
          hair?"</p>
  <p>Barbara returned an evasive answer. It would not do to
          tell Mrs. Hare that her suspicions pointed to one
          particular quarter: it would have agitated her too
          greatly.</p>
  <p>"So vivid was the dream, so matter-of-fact, and like
          reality, that even when I awoke I could not for some
          minutes believe but the murderer was actually at
          West Lynne," resumed Mrs. Hare. "The impression that
          he is here, or is coming here, is upon me yet; a
          sort of under-current of impression, you understand,
          Barbara: <pb n="31"/> of course my own good sense
          tells me that there is no real foundation for
          supposing such to be the case. Oh, Barbara,
          Barbara!" she added, in a tone of wailing, as she
          let her head droop forward, in its pain, till it
          rested on her daughter's arm, "when will this
          unhappy state of things end? One year glides away
          and another comes; year after year, year after year
          they drag on, and Richard remains a banned
          exile!"</p>
  <p>Barbara spoke not: what sympathy or comfort could she
          offer in words? the case admitted of none: but she
          pressed her lips upon her mother's pale
          forehead.</p>
  <p>"Child, I am getting sick, sick to hear of Richard. My
          heart aches for the sight of him," went on the poor
          lady. "Seven years next spring, it will be, since he
          stole here to see us. Seven years, and not a look at
          his beloved face, not a word of news from him to say
          that he is yet in life! Was any mother ever tried as
          I am tried?"</p>
  <p>"Dear mamma, don't! You will make yourself ill."</p>
  <p>"I am ill already, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Yes; but this grief and emotion will render you worse.
          People say that the seventh year always brings a
          change: it may bring one as regards Richard. It may
          bring him clearance, mamma, for all we know. Do not
          despair."</p>
  <p>"Child! I do not despair. Despondency I cannot help at
          times feeling, but it has not reached despair. I
          believe, I truly believe that God will some time
          bring the right to light; how can I despair, then,
          while I trust in Him?"</p>
  <p>There was a pause which Barbara broke. "Shall I bring you
          up some more tea, mamma?"</p>
  <p>"No, my dear. <hi>Send</hi> me some up, for I am thirsty
          still; but you must remain below and get your own
            <pb n="32"/> breakfast. What may your papa not be
          suspecting, if you do not? Guard your very
          countenance. I always dread lest, if we appear sad,
          he should suppose we are thinking of Richard."</p>
  <p>"And what if he did, mamma? Surely thoughts are
          free."</p>
  <p>"Hush, Barbara! hush!" repeated Mrs. Hare, in a whispered
          tone of warning. "You know the oath he has taken to
          bring Richard to justice; you know how determined he
          is; and you know that he fully believes Richard to
          be guilty. If he found we dwelt upon his innocence,
          he might be capable of scouring the whole land from
          one end of it to the other in search of him, to
          deliver him up for trial. Your papa is so very—"</p>
  <p>"Pig-headed," put in Barbara, saucily, though it was not
          precisely a young lady's word, and her cherry lips
          pouted after uttering it.</p>
  <p>"Barbara!" remonstrated Mrs. Hare. "I was going to say so
          very just."</p>
  <p>"Then I say he would be cruel and unnatural, rather than
          just, if he were to search the country that he might
          deliver up his own son to death," returned Barbara,
          with a bold tongue, but wet eyelashes. Very
          carefully did she wipe them dry, before entering the
          breakfast-room.</p>
  <p>The dinner hour of the Hares, when they were alone, was
          four o'clock, and it arrived that day as usual, and
          they sat down to table. Mrs. Hare was better then;
          the sunshine and the business of stirring life had
          in some measure effaced the visions of the night,
          and restored her to her wonted frame of mind. The
          justice mentioned the accident to Joyce: they had
          not heard of it; but they had not been out during
          the day, and <pb n="33"/> had received no visitors.
          Mrs. Hare was full of concern: Joyce was a universal
          favourite.</p>
  <p>The cloth was removed, the justice sat but a little while
          over his port wine, for he was engaged to smoke an
          after-dinner pipe with a brother magistrate, Mr.
          Justice Herbert.</p>
  <p>"Shall you be home to tea, papa?" inquired Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Is it any business of yours, young lady?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, not in the least," answered Miss Barbara. "Only, if
          you had been coming home to tea, I suppose we must
          have waited for you."</p>
  <p>"I thought you said, Richard, that you were going to stay
          the evening with Mr. Herbert," observed Mrs.
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"So I am," responded the justice. "But Barbara has a
          great liking for the sound of her own tongue."</p>
  <p>The justice departed, striding pompously down the
          gravel-walk. Barbara waltzed round the large room to
          a gleeful song, as if she felt his absence a relief.
          Perhaps she did. "You can have tea now, mamma, at
          any time you please, if you are thirsty, without
          waiting till seven," said she.</p>
  <p>"Yes, dear. Barbara."</p>
  <p>"What, mamma?"</p>
  <p>"I am sorry to hear of this calamity which has fallen
          upon Joyce. I should lihe to walk to East Lynne this
          evening and inquire after her; and see her, if I
          may. It would be but neighbourly."</p>
  <p>Barbara's heart beat quicker. Hers was indeed a true and
          lasting love, one that defied time and change. The
          having to bury it wholly within her, had perhaps but
          added to its force and depth. Who could suspect,
          under Barbara's sometimes cold, sometimes playful
            <pb n="34"/> exterior, that <hi>one</hi> was
          hidden in her heart, filling up its every crevice?
          one who had no right there. The intimation that she
          might soon possibly be in his presence, sent every
          pulse throbbing.</p>
  <p>"Walk, did you say, mamma? Should you do right to
          walk?"</p>
  <p>"I feel quite equal to it. Since I have accustomed myself
          to take more exercise I feel better for it, and we
          have not been out to-day. Poor Joyce! What time
          shall we go, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"If we were to get up there by—by seven, I should think
          their dinner will be over then."</p>
  <p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Hare with alacrity, who was always
          pleased when somebody else decided for her. But I
          should like some tea before we start, Barbara."</p>
  <p>Barbara took care that her mamma should have some tea,
          and then they proceeded towards East Lynne. It was a
          lovely evening. The air was warm, and the humming
          gnats sported in it, as if anxious to make the most
          of the waning summer. Mrs. Hare enjoyed it at first,
          but ere she reached East Lynne she became aware that
          the walk was too much for her. She did not usually
          venture upon so long a one; and probably the fever
          and agitation of the morning had somewhat impaired
          her day's strength. She laid her hand upon the iron
          gate as they were turning into the park, and stood
          still.</p>
  <p>"I did wrong to come, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Lean on me, mamma. When you reach those benches, you can
          rest before proceeding to the house. It is very
          warm, and that may have fatigued you."</p>
  <p>They gained the benches, which were placed under some of
          the dark trees, in view of the gates and the road,
          but not of the house, and Mrs. Hare sat down. <pb n="35"/> Another minute, and they were surrounded.
          Mr. Carlyle, his wife and sister, who were taking an
          afterdinner stroll amidst the flowers with their
          guest, Francis Levison, discerned them and came up.
          The children, except the youngest, were of the
          party. Lady Isabel warmly welcomed Mrs. Hare: she
          had become quite attached to the delicate and
          suffering woman.</p>
  <p>"I am a pretty one, am I not, Archibald, to come
          inquiring after an invalid, when I am so much of an
          invalid myself that I have to stop half way!"
          exclaimed Mrs. Hare, as Mr. Carlyle took her hand.
          "I am greatly concerned to hear of poor Joyce."</p>
  <p>"You must stay the evening now you are here," cried Lady
          Isabel. "It will afford you a rest, and tea will
          refresh you."</p>
  <p>"Oh, thank you, but we have taken tea," said Mrs.
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"That is no reason why you should not take some more,"
          she laughed. "Indeed, you seemed too fatigued to be
          anything but a prisoner with us for this next hour
          or two."</p>
  <p>"I fear I am," answered Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"Who are they?" Captain Levison was muttering to himself,
          as he contemplated the guests from a distance. "It's
          a deuced lovely girl, whoever she may be. I think
          I'll approach: they don't look formidable."</p>
  <p>He did approach; and the introduction was made. "Captain
          Levison; Mrs. Hare, and Miss Hare." A few formal
          words, and Captain Levison disappeared again,
          challenging little William Carlyle to a
          foot-race.</p>
  <p>"How very poorly your mamma looks!" Mr. Carlyle exclaimed
          to Barbara, when they were beyond the hearing of
          Mrs. Hare, who was busy talking with Lady <pb n="36"/> Isabel and Miss Carlyle. She has appeared so much
          stronger lately; altogether better."</p>
  <p>"The walk here has fatigued her; I feared it would be too
          long; so that she looks unusually pale," replied
          Barbara. "But what do you think it is that has upset
          her again, Mr. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>He turned his inquiring eyes on Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Papa came down stairs this morning saying mamma was ill;
          that she had one of her old attacks of fever and
          restlessness. As papa spoke, I thought to myself
          could mamma have been dreaming some foolish dream
          again—for you remember how ill she used to be after
          them. I ran up-stairs, and the first thing mamma
          said to me was, that she had had one of those
          dreadful dreams."</p>
  <p>"I fancied she must have outlived her fear of them; that
          her own plain sense had come to her aid long ago,
          showing her how futile dreams are, meaning nothing,
          even if hers do occasionally touch upon that—that
          unhappy mystery."</p>
  <p>"You may just as well reason with a post as reason with
          mamma, when she is suffering from the influence of
          one of those dreams," returned Barbara. "I tried it
          this morning; I asked her to call up—as you observe—
          good sense to her aid. All her answer was, 'How
          could she help her feelings? She did not induce the
          dream by thinking of Richard, or in any other way,
          and yet it came and shattered her.' Of course, so
          far, mamma is right, for she cannot help the dreams
          coming."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle made no immediate reply. He picked up a ball
          belonging to one of the children, which lay in his
          path, and began tossing it gently in his hand. <pb n="37"/> "It is a singular thing," he observed,
          presently, "that we do not hear from Richard."</p>
  <p>"Oh, very; very. And I know mamma distresses herself over
          it. A few words, which she let fall this morning,
          betrayed it plainly. I am no believer in dreams,"
          continued Barbara, "but I cannot deny that these,
          which take such hold upon mamma, bear upon the case
          in a curious manner. The one she had last night
          especially."</p>
  <p>"What was it?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"She dreamt that the real murderer was at West Lynne. She
          thought he was at our house—as a visitor, she said,
          or like one making a morning call—and that she and I
          were conversing with him about the murder. He wanted
          to deny it; to put it upon Richard; and he turned
          and whispered to Otway Bethel, who stood behind his
          chair. That is another strange thing," added
          Barbara, lifting her blue eyes in their deep
          earnestness to the face of Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"What is strange? You speak in enigmas, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"I mean, that Otway Bethel should invariably appear in
          her dreams. Until that stolen visit of Richard's, we
          had no idea Bethel was near the spot at the time,
          and yet he had always made a prominent feature in
          these dreams. Richard assured mamma that Bethel had
          nothing to do with the murder, could have had
          nothing to do with it; but I do not think he shook
          mamma's belief that he <hi>had;</hi> that he was in
          some way connected with the mystery, though perhaps
          not the actual perpetrator. Well, Archibald, mamma
          has not dreamt of it, as she believes, since that
          visit of Richard's until last night; <pb n="38"/>
          when again there was Bethel prominent in the dream.
          It certainly is singular."</p>
  <p>Barbara, in the heat of her subject, in forgetfulness of
          the past, had called him by the old familiar name
          "Archibald:" it was only when she was on the stilts
          of propriety, of coldness, that she said "Mr.
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"And who was the murderer—in your mamma's dream?"
          continued Mr. Carlyle, speaking as gravely as though
          he were upon a subject that men ridicule not.</p>
  <p>"She cannot remember; except that he seemed a gentleman,
          and that we held intercourse with him as such. Now,
          that again is remarkable. We never told her, you
          know, our suspicious of Captain Thorn: Richard said
          'another' had done it, but he did not give mamma the
          faintest indications of who that other might be, or
          what sphere of life he moved in. It seems to me that
          it would be more natural for mamma to have taken up
          the idea in her mind that he was a low, obscure man:
          we do not generally associate the notion of
          gentlemen with murderers: and yet, in her dream, she
          saw he was a gentleman."</p>
  <p>"I think you must be becoming a convert to the theory of
          dreams yourself, Barbara; you are so very earnest,"
          smiled Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"No, not to dreams; but I am earnest for my dear brother
          Richard's sake. Were it in <hi>my</hi> power to do
          anything to elucidate the mystery, I would spare no
          pains, no toil; I would walk barefoot to the end of
          the earth to bring the truth to light. If ever that
          Thorn should come to West Lynne again, I will hope,
          and pray, and strive, to be able to bring it home to
          him."</p>
  <pb n="39"/>
  <p>"That Thorn does not appear in a hurry, again to favour
          West Lynne with his—"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle paused, for Barbara had hurriedly laid her
          hand upon his arm with a warning gesture. In
          talking, they had wandered across the park to its
          ornamental grounds, and were now in a quiet path,
          overshaded on either side by a chain of imitation
          rocks. Seated astride on the summit of these rocks,
          right above where Mr. Carlyle and Barbara were
          standing, was Francis Levison. His face was turned
          from them, and he appeared intent upon a child's
          whip, winding leather round its handle. Whether he
          heard their footsteps or not, he did not turn. They
          quickened their pace, and quitted the walk, bending
          their steps backwards towards the group of
          ladies.</p>
  <p>"Could he have heard what we were saying?" ejaculated
          Barbara, below her breath.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle looked down on the concerned, flushed cheeks,
          with a smile. Barbara was evidently perturbed. But
          for a certain episode of their lives, some years
          ago, he might have soothed her.</p>
  <p>"I think he must have heard a little, Barbara: unless his
          own wits were wool-gathering: he might not be
          attending. What if he did hear? it is of no
          consequence."</p>
  <p>"I was speaking you know, of Captain Thorn—of his being
          the murderer."</p>
  <p>"You were not speaking of Richard or his movements, so
          never mind. Levison is a stranger to the whole; it
          is nothing to him: if he heard the name of Thorn
          mentioned, or could even have distinguished the
          subject, it would bear for him no interest; would
          go, as <pb n="40"/> the saying runs, in at one ear
          and out at the other. Be at rest, Barbara."</p>
  <p>He really did look somewhat tenderly upon her as he
          spoke—and they were near enough to Lady Isabel for
          her to note the glance. She need not have been
          jealous: it bore no treachery to her. But she did
          note it: she had noted also their wandering away
          together, and she jumped to the conclusion that it
          was premeditated —that they had gone beyond her
          sight to enjoy each other's society for a few stolen
          moments. Wonderfully attractive looked Barbara, that
          evening, for Mr. Carlyle or any one else to steal
          away with. Her elegant, airy summer attire, her
          bright blue eyes, her charming features, and her
          lovely complexion. She had untied the strings of her
          pretty white bonnet, and was restlessly playing with
          them, more in thought than nervousness.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, love, how are we to get home?" asked Mrs. Hare.
          "I fear I shall never be able to walk. I wish I had
          told Benjamin to bring the phaeton."</p>
  <p>"I can send to him," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"But it is too bad of me, Archibald, to take you and Lady
          Isabel by storm in this unceremonious manner, and to
          give your servants trouble besides."</p>
  <p>"A great deal too bad, I think," returned Mr. Carlyle,
          with mock gravity. "As to the servants, the one who
          has to go will never recover from the trouble,
          depend upon it. You always were more concerned for
          others than for yourself, dear Mrs. Hare."</p>
  <p>"And you were always kind, Archibald, smoothing
          difficulties for all, and making a trouble of
          nothing. Ah, Lady Isabel, were I a young woman, I
          should be <pb n="41"/> envying you your good
          husband: there are not many like him."</p>
  <p>Possibly the sentence reminded Lady Isabel that another,
          who was young, might be envying her. Isabel's cheeks
          flushed crimson. Mr. Carlyle held out his strong arm
          of help to Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"If sufficiently rested, I fancy you would be more
          comfortable on a sofa in-doors. Allow me to support
          you thither."</p>
  <p>"And you can take my arm on the other side," cried Miss
          Carlyle, placing her tall form by Mrs. Hare.
          "Between us both we will pull you bravely along:
          your feet need scarcely touch the ground."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare laughed, but said she thought Mr. Carlyle's arm
          would be sufficient. She took it, and they were
          turning towards the house, when her eye caught the
          form of a gentleman passing along the road by the
          park gates.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, run," she hurriedly exclaimed. "There's Tom
          Herbert going towards our house; he will call in and
          tell them to send the phaeton, if you ask him, which
          will save the trouble to Mr. Carlyle's servants of
          going expressly. Haste, child; you will be up with
          him in half a minute."</p>
  <p>Barbara, thus urged, set off, on the spur of the moment,
          towards the gates, before the rest of the party well
          knew what was being done. It was too late for Mr.
          Carlyle to stop her and repeat that a servant should
          go, for Barbara was already up with Mr. Tom Herbert.
          The latter had seen her running towards him, and
          waited at the gate.</p>
  <p>"Are you going past our house?" inquired Barbara <pb n="42"/> perceiving then that Otway Bethel also
          stood there, but just beyond view of the avenue.</p>
  <p>"Yes, Why?" replied Tom Herbert, who was not famed for
          his politeness, being blunt by nature and "fast" by
          habit.</p>
  <p>"Mamma would be so much obliged to you if you would just
          call in and leave word that Benjamin is to bring up
          the phaeton. Mamma walked here, intending to walk
          home, but she finds herself so fatigued as to be
          unequal to it."</p>
  <p>"All right; I'll call and send him. What time?"</p>
  <p>Nothing had been said to Barbara about the time, so she
          was at liberty to name her own. "Ten o'clock. We
          shall be home then before papa."</p>
  <p>"That you will," responded Tom Herbert. "He and the
          governor and two or three more old codgers are
          blowing clouds till you can't see across the room:
          and they are sure to get at it again after supper. I
          say, Miss Barbara, are you good for a few
          pic-nics?"</p>
  <p>"Good for a great many," returned Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Our girls want to get up some in the next week or two.
          Jack is at home, you know."</p>
  <p>"Is he?" said Barbara, in surprise.</p>
  <p>"We had the letter yesterday, and he came to-day, a
          brother officer with him. Jack vows if the girls
          don't cater well for them in the way of amusement,
          he'll never honour them by spending his leave at
          home again: so mind you keep yourself in readiness
          for any fun that may turn up. Good evening."</p>
  <p>"Good evening, Miss Hare," added Otway Bethel. As Barbara
          was returning their salutation, she became conscious
          of other footsteps, advancing from the same
          direction that they had come, and moved her head <pb n="43"/> hastily round. Two gentlemen, walking
          arm-in-arm, were close upon her, in one of whom she
          recognised "Jack," otherwise Major Herbert. He
          stopped and held out his hand.</p>
  <p>"It is some years since we met, but I have not forgotten
          the pretty face of Miss Barbara," he cried. "A young
          girl's face it was then, but it is a stately young
          lady's now."</p>
  <p>Barbara laughed. "Your brother told me you had arrived at
          West Lynne; but I did not know you were so close to
          me. He has been asking me if I am ready for some
          pic—"</p>
  <p>Barbara's voice faltered, and the rushing crimson of
          emotion dyed her face. Whose face was <hi>that</hi>
          , who was he, standing opposite to her, side by side
          with John Herbert? She had seen the face but once,
          yet it had planted itself upon her memory in
          characters of fire. Major Herbert continued to talk,
          but Barbara for once lost her self-possession: she
          could not listen; she could not answer; she could
          only stare at that face as if fascinated to the
          gaze, looking herself something like a simpleton,
          her shy blue eyes anxious and restless, and her lips
          turning to an ashy whiteness. A strange feeling of
          wonder, of superstition, was creeping over Barbara.
          Was that man before her in sober, veritable reality?
          —or was it but a phantom, called up in her mind by
          the associations arising from her mamma's dream; or
          by the conversation held not many moments ago with
          Mr. Carlyle?</p>
  <p>Major Herbert may have deemed that Barbara, who was not
          attending to him, but to his companion, wished for
          an introduction, and he accordingly made it.
            <hi>"Captain Thorn;</hi> Miss Hare."</p>
  <pb n="44"/>
  <p>Then Barbara roused herself; her senses were partially
          coming to her, and she became alive to the fact that
          they must deem her behaviour unorthodox for a young
          lady.</p>
  <p>"I—I—looked at Captain Thorn, for I thought I remembered
          his face," she stammered.</p>
  <p>"I was in West Lynne for a day or two some five years
          ago," he observed.</p>
  <p>"Ah—yes," returned Barbara. "Are you going to make a long
          stay now?"</p>
  <p>"We have several weeks' leave of absence. Whether we
          shall remain here all the time, I cannot say."</p>
  <p>Barbara parted from them. Thought upon thought crowded
          upon her brain as she flew back to East Lynne. She
          ran up the steps to the hall, gliding towards a
          group which stood near its further end—her mother,
          Miss Carlyle, Mr. Carlyle, and little Isabel: Lady
          Isabel she did not see. Mrs. Hare was then going up
          to see Joyce. In the agitation of the moment she
          stealthily touched Mr. Carlyle, and he stepped away
          from the rest to speak to her, she drawing back
          towards the door of one of the reception rooms, and
          motioning him to approach.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald, I must speak to you alone? Could you not
          come out again for a little while?"</p>
  <p>He nodded, and walked out openly by her side. Why should
          he not? What had he to conceal? But, unfortunately,
          Lady Isabel, who had but gone into that same room
          for a minute and was coming out again to join Mrs.
          Hare, both saw Barbara's touch upon her husband's
          arm, marked her agitation, and heard her words. She
          went to one of the hall windows and watched them
          saunter towards the more private parts <pb n="45"/>
          of the grounds; she saw her husband send back
          Isabel. Never, since her marriage, had Lady Isabel's
          jealousy been excited as it was excited that
          evening."</p>
  <p>"I—I feel—I scarcely know whether I am awake or
          dreaming," began Barbara, putting up her hand to her
          brow, and speaking in a dreamy tone. "Pardon me for
          bringing you out in this unceremonious fashion."</p>
  <p>"What state secrets have you to disclose?" asked Mr.
          Carlyle, in a jesting manner.</p>
  <p>"We were speaking of mamma's dream. She said the
          impression it left upon her mind—that the murderer
          was at West Lynne—was so vivid that, in spite of
          common sense, she could not persuade herself that he
          was not. Well—just now—"</p>
  <p>"Barbara, what <hi>can</hi> be the matter?" said Mr.
          Carlyle, perceiving that her agitation was so great
          as to impede her words.</p>
  <p>" <hi>I have just seen him</hi> ," she rejoined.</p>
  <p>"Seen him?" echoed Mr. Carlyle, looking at her fixedly, a
          doubt crossing his mind whether Barbara's mind might
          be as uncollected as her manner.</p>
  <p>"What were nearly my last words to you? That if ever that
          Thorn did come to West Lynne again, I would leave no
          stone unturned to bring it home to him. He is here,
          Archibald. When I went to the gates to speak to Tom
          Herbert, his brother Major Herbert was also there,
          and with him Captain Thorn. Bethel also. Do you
          wonder, I say, that I know not whether I am awake or
          dreaming? They have some weeks' holiday and are here
          to spend it."</p>
  <p>"It is a singular coincidence," exclaimed Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Had anything been wanting to convince me that Thorn is
          the guilty man, this would have done it," <pb n="46"/> went on Barbara in her excitement. "Mamma's
          dream, with the steadfast impression it left upon
          her that Hallijohn's murderer was now at West
          Lynne—"</p>
  <p>In turning the sharp corner of the covered walk, they
          came in contact with Captain Levison, who appeared
          to be either standing or sauntering there, his hands
          underneath his coat-tails. Again Barbara felt vexed,
          wondering how much he had heard, and beginning in
          her heart to dislike the man. He accosted them
          familiarly, and appeared as if he would have turned
          with them; but none could put down presumption more
          effectually than Mr. Carlyle, calm and gentlemanly
          though he always was.</p>
  <p>"I will join you presently, Captain Levison," he said,
          with a wave of the hand. And he turned back with
          Barbara towards the open parts of the park.</p>
  <p>"Do you like that Captain Levison?" she abruptly
          inquired, when they were beyond hearing.</p>
  <p>"I cannot say that I do," was Mr. Carlyle's reply.</p>
  <p>"He is one who does not improve upon acquaintance."</p>
  <p>"To me, it looks as though he had placed himself in our
          way to hear what we were saying."</p>
  <p>"No, no, Barbara. What interest could it bear for
          him?"</p>
  <p>Barbara did not contest the point: she turned to the one
          nearer at heart. "What must be our course with
          regard to Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"It is more than I can tell you," replied Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I cannot go up to the man and unceremoniously accuse him
          of being Hallijohn's murderer. In the first place,
          Barbara, we are not positively sure that he is the
          same man spoken of by Richard."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald, how can you doubt? The extra-ordinary <pb n="47"/> fact of his appearing here at this
          moment, coupled with mamma's dream, might assure us
          of it."</p>
  <p>"Not quite," smiled Mr. Carlyle. "All we can do is to go
          cautiously to work, and endeavour to ascertain
          whether he is the same."</p>
  <p>"And there is no one but you to do it!" wailed Barbara.
          "How vain and foolish are our boastings! I said I
          would not cease striving to bring it home to him,
          did he come again to West Lynne: and now he is here,
          even as the words were in my mouth, and what can I
          do? Nothing."</p>
  <p>They took their way to the house, for there was nothing
          further to discuss. Captain Levison had entered it
          before them, and saw Lady Isabel standing at the
          hall window. Yes, she was standing and looking;
          brooding over her fancied wrongs.</p>
  <p>"Who is that Miss Hare?" he demanded, in a cynical tone.
          "They appear to have a pretty good understanding
          together: twice this evening I have met them in
          secret conversation."</p>
  <p>"Did you speak to me, sir?" sharply and haughtily
          returned Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I did not mean to offend you: I spoke of Mr. Carlyle and
          Miss Hare," he replied in a gentle voice. He knew
          she had distinctly heard his first speech in spite
          of her question.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VI. CAPTAIN THORN IN TROUBLE ABOUT "A
          BILL."</head>
  <p><hi>In</hi> talking over a bygone misfortune, we
          sometimes make the remark, or hear it made,
          "Circumstances worked against it." Such and such a
          thing might have turned out differently, we say, had
          the surrounding circumstances been more favourable,
          but they were in opposition; they were dead against
          it. Now, if ever attendant circumstances can be said
          to have borne a beneful influence upon any person in
          this world, they most assuredly did at the present
          time upon Lady Isabel Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Coeval, you see, with the arrival of the ex-captain,
          Levison, at East Lynne, all the jealous feeling,
          touching her husband and Barbara Hare, was renewed,
          and with greater force than ever. Barbara, painfully
          anxious that something should be brought to light by
          which her brother should be exonerated from the
          terrible charge under which he lay; fully believing
          that Frederick Thorn, captain in her Majesty's
          service, was the man who had committed the crime, as
          asserted by Richard, was in a state of excitement
          bordering on frenzy. Too keenly she felt the truth
          of her own words, that she was powerless, that she
          could, herself, do nothing. When she rose in the
          morning, after a <pb n="49"/> night passed in
          troubled reflection more than in sleep, her thoughts
          were, "Oh, that I could this day find out something
          certain!" She was often at the Herberts'; frequently
          invited there, sometimes going uninvited: she and
          the Miss Herberts were intimate, and they pressed
          Barbara into all the impromptu fêtes got up for
          their brother now he was at home. There she of
          course saw Captain Thorn, and now and then she was
          enabled to pick up scraps of his past history.
          Eagerly were these scraps carried to Mr. Carlyle.
          Not to his office; Barbara would not appear there.
          It may be, that she feared, if seen haunting Mr.
          Carlyle's office, Captain Thorn might come to hear
          of it and suspect the agitation that was afloat—for
          who could know better, than he, the guilt that was
          falsely attaching to Richard? Therefore she chose
          rather to go to East Lynne, or to waylay Mr. Carlyle
          as he passed to and from business. It was but little
          she gathered to tell him: one evening she met him
          with the news that Thorn <hi>had</hi> been in former
          years at West Lynne, though she could not fix the
          date: another time she went boldly to East Lynne in
          eager anxiety, ostensibly to make a call on Lady
          Isabel—and a very restless one it was—contriving to
          make Mr. Carlyle understand that she wanted to see
          him alone. He went out with her when she departed,
          and accompanied her as far as the park gates, the
          two evidently absorbed in earnest converse: Lady
          Isabel's jealous eyes saw that. The communication
          Barbara had to make was, that Captain Thorn had let
          fall the avowal that he had once been "in trouble,"
          though of its nature there was no indication given.
          Another journey of hers took the scrap of news, that
          she had <pb n="50"/> discovered he knew Swainson
          well. Part of all this, nay, perhaps the whole of
          it, Mr. Carlyle had found out for himself;
          nevertheless, he always received Barbara with vivid
          interest. Richard Hare was related to Miss Carlyle,
          and if his innocence could be made clear in the
          sight of men, it would be little less gratifying to
          them than to the Hares. Of Richard's innocence, Mr.
          Carlyle now entertained little, if any, doubt, and
          he was becoming impressed with the guilt of Captain
          Thorn. The latter spoke mysteriously of a portion of
          his past life—when he could be brought to speak of
          it at all— and he bore evidently some secret that he
          did not care to have alluded to.</p>
  <p>But now, look at the mean treachery of that man, Francis
          Levison! The few meetings that Lady Isabel witnessed
          between her husband and Barbara would have been
          quite enough to excite her anger and jealousy, and
          to trouble her peace; but, in addition, Francis
          Levison took care to tell her of those she did not
          see. It pleased him—he could best tell his own
          motive—to watch the movements of Mr. Carlyle and
          Barbara. There was a hedge pathway through the
          fields, on the opposite side of the road to the
          residence of Justice Hare, and as Mr. Carlyle walked
          down the road to business, in his unsuspicion (not
          one time in fifty did he choose to ride: he said the
          walk to and fro kept him in health), Captain Levison
          would be strolling down like a serpent behind the
          hedge, watching all his movements, watching his
          interviews with Barbara if any took place, watching
          Mr. Carlyle turn into the grove, as he sometimes
          did, and perhaps watch Barbara run out of the house
          to meet him. It was all retailed with miserable
          exaggeration, to Lady Isabel, whose <pb n="51"/>
          jealousy, as a natural sequence, grew feverish in
          its extent.</p>
  <p>It is scarcely necessary to explain, that of Lady
          Isabel's jealousy Barbara knew nothing: not a shadow
          of suspicion had ever penetrated to her mind that
          Lady Isabel was jealous of her. Had she been told
          that such was the fact, she would have laughed in
          derision at her informant. Mr. Carlyle's happy wife,
          proudly secure in her position and in his affection,
          jealous of <hi>her!</hi> of her, to whom he never
          gave an admiring look or a loving word! It would
          have taken a good deal to make Barbara believe
          that.</p>
  <p>How different were the facts in reality. These meetings
          of Mr. Carlyle's and Barbara's, instead of being
          episodes of love-making and tender speeches, were
          positively painful to Barbara, from the unhappy
          nature of the subject to be discussed. Far from
          feeling a reprehensible pleasure in seeking the
          meetings with Mr. Carlyle, Barbara shrank from them:
          but that she was urged by dire necessity, in the
          interests of Richard, she would wholly have avoided
          them. Poor Barbara, in spite of that explosion of
          feeling years back, was a lady, possessed of lady's
          ideas and feelings, and— remembering that
          explosion—it did not at all accord with her pride to
          be pushing herself into what might be called secret
          meetings with Archibald Carlyle. But Barbara, in her
          love for her brother, pressed down all thoughts of
          self, and went perseveringly forward for Richard's
          sake.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was seated one morning in his private room at
          his office, when his head clerk, Mr. Dill, came in.
          "A gentlemen is asking to see you, Mr.
          Archibald."</p>
  <pb n="52"/>
  <p>"I am too busy to see anybody for this hour to come. You
          know that, Dill."</p>
  <p>"So I told him, sir, and he says he will wait. It is that
          Captain Thorn who is staying here with John
          Herbert."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle raised his eyes, and they encountered those
          of the old man: a peculiar expression was in the
          face of both. Mr. Carlyle glanced down at the
          parchments he was perusing, as if calculating his
          time. Then he looked up again and spoke.</p>
  <p>"I will see <hi>him</hi> , Dill. Send him in."</p>
  <p>The business, leading to the visit, was quite simple.
          Captain Frederick Thorn had got himself into some
          trouble and vexation about "a bill"—like too many
          other captains do on occasions, and he had come to
          crave advice of Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt dubious as to giving it. This Captain
          Thorn was a pleasant, attractive man, who won much
          on acquaintance; one whom Mr. Carlyle would have
          been pleased, in a friendly point of view, and
          setting professional interests apart, to help out of
          his difficulties: but if he were the villain they
          suspected him to be, the man with crime upon his
          hand, then Mr. Carlyle would have ordered his office
          door held wide for him to slink out of it.</p>
  <p>"Cannot you advise me what my course ought to be?" he
          inquired, detecting Mr. Carlyle's hesitation.</p>
  <p>"I could advise you, certainly. But—you must excuse my
          being plain, Captain Thorn—I like to know who my
          clients are, before I take up their cause or accept
          them as clients."</p>
  <p>"I am able to pay you," was Captain Thorn's reply.</p>
  <p>"I am not short of ready money; only this bill—"</p>
  <pb n="53"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed out, after having bit his lip with
          annoyance. "It was a natural inference of yours," he
          said, "but I assure you I was not thinking of your
          purse. My father held it right never to undertake
          business for a stranger: unless a man was good, and
          his cause good, he did not entertain it; and I have
          acted on the same principle. By these means, the
          position and character of our business is such, as
          is rarely attained by a solicitor. Now, in saying
          that you are a stranger to me, I am not casting any
          doubt upon you, Captain Thorn; I am merely upholding
          my common practice."</p>
  <p>"My family is well connected," was Captain Thorn's next
          venture.</p>
  <p>"Excuse me: family has nothing to do with it. If the
          poorest day labourer, if a pauper out of the
          work-house came to me for advice, he should be
          heartily welcome to it, provided he were an honest
          man in the face of day. Again I repeat, you must
          take no offence at what I say, for I cast no
          reflection on you: I only urge that you and your
          character are unknown to me."</p>
  <p>Curious words from a lawyer to a client-aspirant, and
          Captain Thorn found them so. But Mr. Carlyle's tone
          was so courteous, his manner so affable, in fact, he
          was so thoroughly the gentleman, that it was
          impossible to feel hurt.</p>
  <p>"Well—how can I convince you that I am respectable? I
          have served my country ever since I was sixteen, and
          my brother officers have found no cause of
          complaint. My position as an officer and a gentleman
          would be generally deemed a sufficient guarantee.
          Inquire of John Herbert. The Herberts, too, are
          friends <pb n="54"/> of yours, and they have not
          disdained to give me house room amidst their
          family."</p>
  <p>"True," returned Mr. Carlyle, feeling that he could not
          well object further; and also that all men should be
          deemed innocent until proved guilty. "At any rate, I
          will advise you what must be done at present," he
          added, "though if the affair must go on, I do not
          promise that I can continue to act for you. I am
          very busy just now."</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn explained his dilemma, and Mr. Carlyle told
          him what to do in it. "Were you not at West Lynne
          some ten years ago?" he suddenly inquired at the
          close of the conversation. "You denied it to me once
          at my house; but I concluded, from an observation
          you let fall, that you had been here."</p>
  <p>"Yes, I was," replied Captain Thorn, in a confidential
          tone. "I don't mind owning it to you in confidence,
          but I do not wish it to get abroad. I was not at
          West Lynne, but in its neighbourhood. The fact is,
          when I was a careless young fellow. I was stopping a
          few miles from here, and got into a scrape, through
          a— a—in short, it was an affair of gallantry. I did
          not show out very well at the time, and I don't care
          that it should be known I am in the county
          again."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle's pulses—for Richard Hare's sake—beat a shade
          quicker. The avowal "an affair of gallantry" was
          almost a confirmation of his suspicions.</p>
  <p>"Yes," he pointedly said. "The girl was Afy
          Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>"Afy—who?" repeated Captain Thorn, opening his eyes, and
          fixing them on Mr. Carlyle's.</p>
  <p>"Afy Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn continued to look at Mr. Carlyle, an <pb n="55"/> amused expression, rather than any other,
          predominant on his features. "You are mistaken." he
          observed. "Afy Hallijohn? I never heard the name
          before in my life."</p>
  <p>"Did you never hear, or know, that a dreadful tragedy was
          enacted in this place about that period?" returned
          Mr. Carlyle, in a low, meaning tone. "That Afy
          Hallijohn's father—"</p>
  <p>"Oh, stay, stay, stay," hastily interrupted Captain
          Thorn. "I am telling a story in saying I never heard
          the name. Afy Hallijohn? Why, that's the girl Tom
          Herbert was telling me about: who—what was it?—
          disappeared, after her father was murdered."</p>
  <p>"Murdered in his own cottage; almost in Afy's presence;
          murdered by—by—" Mr. Carlyle recollected himself: he
          had spoken more impulsively than was his custom.
          "Hallijohn was my father's faithful clerk for many
          years," he more calmly concluded.</p>
  <p>"And he, who committed the murder, was young Hare, son of
          Justice Hare, and brother to that attractive girl,
          Barbara. Your speaking of this has recalled what
          they told me to my recollection. The first evening I
          was at the Herberts', Justice Hare and others were
          there, smoking—half a dozen pipes were going at
          once; I also saw Miss Barbara that evening at your
          park gates; and Tom told me of the murder. An awful
          calamity for the Hares. I suppose that is the reason
          the young lady is Miss Hare still: one, with her
          good fortune and good looks, ought to have changed
          her name ere this."</p>
  <p>"No, it is not the reason," resumed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"What is the reason, then?"</p>
  <p>A faint flush tinged the brow of Mr. Carlyle. "I <pb n="56"/> know more than one who would be glad to
          get Barbara, in spite of the murder. Do not
          depreciate Miss Hare."</p>
  <p>"Not I indeed; I like the young lady too well," replied
          Captain Thorn. "The girl, Afy has never been heard
          of since, has she?"</p>
  <p>"Never," said Mr. Carlyle. "Did you know her well?" he
          deliberately added.</p>
  <p>"I never knew her at all, if you mean Afy Hallijohn. Why
          should you think I did. I never heard of her till
          Tom Herbert amused me with the history."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle devoutly wished he could tell whether the man
          before him was speaking truth or falsehood. He
          continued.</p>
  <p>"Afy's favours—I mean her smiles and her chatter— were
          pretty freely dispersed, for she was heedless and
          vain. Amidst others who got the credit for
          occasionally basking in her rays, was a gentleman of
          the name of Thorn. Was it not yourself?"</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn stroked his moustache with an air that
          seemed to say he <hi>could</hi> boast of his share
          of such baskings; in short, as if he felt half
          inclined to do it. "Upon my word," he simpered, "you
          do me too much honour: I cannot confess to having
          been favoured by Miss Afy."</p>
  <p>"Then she was not the—the damsel you speak of, who drove
          you—if I understood aright—from the locality?"
          resumed Mr. Carlyle, fixing his eyes upon him, so as
          to take in every tone of the answer, and shade of
          the countenance, as he gave it.</p>
  <p>"I should think not, indeed. It was a married lady,
          more's the pity; young, pretty, vain, and heedless,
          as you represent this Afy. Things went smoother
          after a time, and she and her husband—a stupid
          country <pb n="57"/> yeoman—became reconciled: but I
          have been ashamed of the affair ever since; doubly
          ashamed of it since I have grown wiser, and I do not
          care ever to be recognised as the actor in it, or to
          have it raked up against me."</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn rose, and took a somewhat hasty leave. Was
          he, or was he not the man? Mr. Carlyle could not
          solve the doubt.</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill came in as he disappeared, closed the door and
          advanced to his master, speaking in an under
          tone.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Archibald, has it struck you that the gentleman,
          just gone out, may be the Lieutenant Thorn you once
          spoke to me about?—he who had used to gallop over
          from Swainson to court Afy Hallijohn?"</p>
  <p>"It has struck me so most forcibly," replied Mr. Carlyle.
          "Dill, I would give five hundred pounds out of my
          pocket this moment, to be assured of the fact— if he
          is the same."</p>
  <p>"I have seen him several times since he has been staying
          with the Herberts," pursued the old gentleman, "and
          my doubts have naturally been excited, as to whether
          it could be the man in question. Curious enough,
          Bezant, the doctor, was over here yesterday from
          Swainson; and, as I was walking with him arm-in-arm,
          we met Captain Thorn. The two recognized each other
          and bowed, but merely as distant acquaintances. 'Do
          you know that gentleman?' said I to Bezant. 'Yes,'
          he answered, 'it is Mr. Frederick.' 'Mr. Frederick
          with something added to it,' said I: 'his name is
          Thorn.' 'I know that,' returned Bezant, 'but when he
          was in Swainson some years ago, he chose to drop the
          Thorn, and the town in general knew him <pb n="58"/>
          only as Mr. Frederick.' 'What was he doing there,
          Bezant?' I asked. 'Amusing himself and getting into
          mischief,' was the answer: 'nothing very bad, only
          the random scrapes of young men.' 'Was he often on
          horseback, riding to a distance?' was my next
          question. 'Yes, that he was,' replied Bezant; 'none
          more fond of galloping across the country than he: I
          used to tell him he'd ride his horse's tail off.'
          Now, Mr. Archibald, what do you think?" concluded
          the old clerk: "and so far as I could make out, this
          was about the very time of the tragedy at
          Hallijohn's."</p>
  <p>"Think?" replied Mr. Carlyle, "what can I think but that
          it is the same man? I am convinced of it now."</p>
  <p>And, leaning back in his chair, he fell into a deep
          reverie, regardless of the parchments that lay
          before him.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VII. THE SECRET SCRAP OF PAPER.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> weeks went on; two or three: and things
          seemed to be progressing backwards, rather than
          forwards —if that's not Irish. Francis Levison's
          affairs— that is, the adjustment of them—did not
          advance at all: creditors were obstinate. He had
          been three times over to Levison Park, securely
          boxed up in Mr. Carlyle's close carriage from the
          prying eyes of beholders: but Sir Peter seemed to be
          turning as obdurate as the creditors. Captain
          Levison had deceived him, he found out: inasmuch as
          certain sums of money, handed over by Sir Peter some
          time back to settle certain claims, had been by the
          gentleman appropriated to his own purposes. Sir
          Peter did not appear inclined to forgive the deceit,
          and vowed he would do nothing further yet awhile.
          There was nothing for him but to return to the
          Continent, Captain Levison observed. And the best
          place for him; plenty of scamps congregated there,
          was the retort of Sir Peter. He apparently meant
          what he said, for when Francis Levison rose to
          leave, Sir Peter took out of his pocket-book notes
          to the value of 100 <hi>l</hi> ., told him that
          would pay for the expense he had been put to in
          coming, and that his allowance would be continued as
          usual.</p>
  <pb n="60"/>
  <p>"How did you get on to-day with Sir Peter?" inquired Mr.
          Carlyle, that evening at dinner, when his guest was
          back at East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Middling," replied Francis Levison. "I did not do much
          with him. These old stagers like to take their own
          time over things."</p>
  <p>An answer false as he was. It did not suit his plans to
          quit East Lynne yet; and, had he told the truth, he
          would have had no plea for remaining.</p>
  <p>Another thing that was going on fast to bad, instead of
          to good, was the jealousy of Lady Isabel. How could
          it be otherwise, kept up, as it was, by Barbara's
          frequent meetings with Mr. Carlyle, and by Captain
          Levison's comments and false insinuations regarding
          them? Discontented with herself and with everybody
          about her, Isabel was living now in a state of
          excitement; a dangerous resentment against her
          husband working in her heart. That very day, the one
          of Captain Levison's visit to Levison Park, in
          driving through West Lynne in the pony carriage, she
          had come upon her husband in close converse with
          Barbara Hare. So absorbed were they that they never
          saw her, though her carriage passed close to the
          pavement where they stood.</p>
  <p>On the morning following, as the Hare family were seated
          at breakfast, the postman was seen coming towards
          the house. Barbara sprang from her seat to the open
          window, and the man advanced to her.</p>
  <p>"Only one, miss. It is for yourself."</p>
  <p>"Who is it from?" began the justice, as Barbara returned
          to her chair. In letters, as in other things, he was
          curious to know their contents, whether they might
          be addressed to himself or not.</p>
  <pb n="61"/>
  <p>"It is from Anne, papa," replied Barbara, as she laid the
          letter by her side on the table.</p>
  <p>"Why don't you open it and see what she says?"</p>
  <p>"I will, directly. I am just going to pour out some more
          tea for mamma."</p>
  <p>Barbara handed her mamma the tea, and then took up her
          letter. As she opened it, a small bit of paper,
          folded, fell upon her lap. Fortunately, most
          fortunately, Justice Hare, who at the moment had his
          nose in his coffee-cup, did not see it, but Mrs.
          Hare did.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, you have dropped something."</p>
  <p>Barbara had seen it also, and was clutching stealthily at
          the "something" with almost a guilty movement. She
          had no ready answer at hand, but bent her eyes upon
          her letter, and Mrs. Hare spoke again.</p>
  <p>"My love, something dropped on your lap."</p>
  <p>"Don't you hear your mamma, young lady?" pursued the
          justice. "What is it that you have dropped?"</p>
  <p>Barbara, with a crimson face of heat, rose from her chair
          and shook out her pretty muslin dress—somehow,
          Barbara's dresses were always pretty. "There's
          nothing at all, papa, nothing that I can see." And,
          in sitting down, she contrived to give her mother a
          warning look, which silenced Mrs. Hare. Then Barbara
          read her sister's letter, and laid it open on the
          table for the benefit of anybody else, who might
          like to do the same.</p>
  <p>The justice snatched it up, taking first benefit to
          himself—as he was sure to do. He threw it down,
          grumbling.</p>
  <p>"Not much in it. There never is in Anne's letters: she
          won't set the Thames on fire as a correspondent. As
          if anybody cared to hear about the baby's being <pb n="62"/> 'short-coated!' I think I'll have a cup
          more coffee, Barbara."</p>
  <p>Finally the justice finished his breakfast and strolled
          out into the garden. Mrs. Hare turned to
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"My dear, why did you give me that mysterious look? And
          what was it that dropped upon your lap? It seemed to
          fall from Anne's letter."</p>
  <p>"Well, mamma, it did fall from Anne's letter. You know
          how exacting papa is—always will see and inquire
          into everything—so, when Anne wants to tell me any
          bit of news that she does not care the whole world
          to know, she writes it on a separate bit of paper
          and puts it inside her letter. I suppose it was one
          of those bits that fell out."</p>
  <p>"Child, I cannot let you insinuate that your papa has no
          right to look into your letters."</p>
  <p>"Of course not, mamma," was Miss Barbara's rejoinder.
          "But if he had a grain of common sense, he might
          judge that I and Anne may sometimes have little
          private matters to say to each other, not necessary
          or expedient for him to pry into."</p>
  <p>Barbara had produced the scrap of paper as she spoke, and
          was opening it. Mrs. Hare watched her movements, and
          her countenance. She saw the latter flush suddenly
          and vividly, and then become deadly pale: she saw
          Barbara crush the note in her hand when read.</p>
  <p>"Oh, mamma!" she uttered.</p>
  <p>The flush of emotion came also into Mrs. Hare's delicate
          cheeks. "Barbara! is it bad news?"</p>
  <p>"Mamma, it—it—is about Richard!" she whispered, glancing
          at the door and window, to see that none might be
          within sight or hearing. "I never thought <pb n="63"/> of him: I only fancied Anne might be sending me
          some bit of news concerning her own affairs. Good
          Heavens! how fortunate—how providential that papa
          did not see the paper fall; and that you did not
          persist in your inquiries! If he—"</p>
  <p>"Barbara, you are keeping me in suspense," interrupted
          Mrs. Hare, who had also grown white. "What should
          Anne know about Richard?"</p>
  <p>Barbara smoothed out the writing and held it before her
          mother. It was as follows:</p>
  <p>"I have had a curious note from R. It was without date or
          signature, but I knew his handwriting. He tells me
          to let you know, in the most sure and private manner
          that I can, that he will soon he paying you another
          night visit. You are to watch the grove every
          evening when the present moon gets bright."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare covered her face for some minutes. "Thank God
          for all his mercies!" she murmured.</p>
  <p>"Oh, mamma, but it is an awful risk for him to run!"</p>
  <p>"But to know that he is in life—to know that he is in
          life! And for the risk—Barbara, I dread it not. The
          same good God who protected him through the last
          visit, will protect him through this. He will not
          forsake the oppressed, the innocent. Destroy that
          paper, child."</p>
  <p>"Archibald Carlyle must first see it, mamma. I will
          destroy it afterwards."</p>
  <p>"Then seek him out to-day and show it him. I shall not be
          easy until it is destroyed, Barbara."</p>
  <p>Braving the comments of the gossips, hoping the visit
          would not reach the ears or eyes of the justice,
          Barbara went that day to the office of Mr. Carlyle.
          He <pb n="64"/> was not there: he was not at West
          Lynne: he was gone to Lynneborough on business, and
          Mr. Dill thought it a question if he would be at the
          office again that day. If so, it would be late in
          the afternoon. Barbara, as soon as their own dinner
          was over, took up her patient station at the gate,
          hoping to see him pass; but the time went by, and he
          did not. She had little doubt that he had returned
          home without going again to West Lynne.</p>
  <p>What should she do? Go up to East Lynne and see him, said
          her conscience. Barbara's mind was in a strangely
          excited state. It appeared to her that this visit of
          Richard's must have been specially designed by
          Providence, that he might be confronted with Thorn.
          That they must be confronted the one with the other,
          or, rather, that Richard must have the opportunity
          given to him of seeing Thorn, was a matter of
          course; though how it was to be brought about,
          Barbara could not guess. For all action, all plans,
          she must depend upon Mr. Carlyle; he ought to be put
          in immediate possession of the news, for the moon
          was already three or four days old, and there was no
          knowing when Richard might appear.</p>
  <p>"Mamma," she said, returning in-doors, after seeing the
          justice depart upon an evening visit to the Buck's
          Head, where he and certain other justices and
          gentlemen sometimes congregated to smoke and chat,
          "I shall go up to East Lynne if you have no
          objection. I must see Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"What objection can I have, my dear? I am all anxiety for
          you to see him. It is so unfortunate that he was out
          to-day when you ventured to his office. <pb n="65"/>
          Mind you tell him all; and ask him what is best to
          be done."</p>
  <p>Away went Barbara. It had struck seven when she arrived
          at East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Is Mr. Carlyle disengaged?"</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle is not yet home, miss. My lady and Miss
          Carlyle are waiting dinner for him."</p>
  <p>A check for Barbara. The servant asked her to walk in,
          but she declined, and turned from the door. She was
          in no mood for visit paying.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel had been standing at the window watching for
          her husband, wondering what made him so late: she
          observed Barbara approach the house, and saw her
          walk away again. Presently the servant who had
          answered the door entered the drawing-room.</p>
  <p>"Was not that Miss Hare?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, my lady," was the man's reply. "She wanted master.
          I said your ladyship was at home, but she would not
          enter."</p>
  <p>Isabel said no more. She caught the eyes of Francis
          Levison fixed on her with as much compassionate
          meaning, as they dared express. She elasped her
          hands in pain, and turned again to the window.</p>
  <p>Barbara was slowly walking down the avenue, Mr. Carlyle
          was then in sight, coming on quickly. Lady Isabel
          saw their hands meet in greeting.</p>
  <p>"Oh, I am so thankful to have met you!" exclaimed
          Barbara, impulsively. "I actually went to your
          office to-day, and I have been now to your house. We
          have great news!"</p>
  <p>"Ay! What? About Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"No, about Richard," replied Barbara, taking the <pb n="66"/> scrap of paper from the folds of her
          dress. "This came to me this morning, from
          Anne."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle took the document, and Barbara looked over
          him whilst he read it: neither of them thinking that
          Lady Isabel's jealous eyes, and Captain Levison's
          evil ones, were strained on them from the distant
          windows. Miss Carlyle's also were, for the matter of
          that.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, it seems to me that Providence must be
          directing him hither at this moment. Our suspicions,
          with regard to Thorn, can now be set at rest. You
          must contrive that Richard shall see him. What can
          he be coming again for?"</p>
  <p>"More money," was the supposition of Mr. Carlyle. "Does
          Mrs. Hare know of this?"</p>
  <p>"She does, unfortunately. I opened the paper before her,
          never dreaming it was connected with Richard. I wish
          I could have spared mamma the news, until he was
          actually here: the expectation and suspense I fear
          will make her ill. It terrifies me to that extent
          that I don't know what I am about," she continued.
          "Not a moment's rest or peace shall I have, until he
          has been and is gone again. Poor, wandering, unhappy
          Richard! and not to be guilty!"</p>
  <p>"He acted as though he were guilty, Barbara. And that
          line of conduct often entails as much trouble as
          real guilt."</p>
  <p>"You do not believe him guilty?" she almost passionately
          uttered.</p>
  <p>"I do not. I have little doubt of the guilt of
          Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Oh, if it could but be brought home to him!" reiterated
          Barbara: "so that Richard might be cleared <pb n="67"/> in the sight of day. How can you contrive
          that he shall see Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"I cannot tell; I must think it over. Let me know the
          instant he arrives, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Of course I shall. It may be, that he does not want
          money; that his errand is only to see mamma. He was
          always so fond of her."</p>
  <p>"I must leave you," said Mr. Carlyle, taking her hand in
          token of farewell. Then, as a thought occurred to
          him, he turned and walked a few steps with her,
          without releasing it. He was probably quite
          unconscious that he retained it; she was not.</p>
  <p>"You know, Barbara, if he should want money, and it
          should not be convenient to Mrs. Hare to supply it
          at so short a notice, I can give it him, as I did
          before."</p>
  <p>"Thank you, thank you, Archibald. Mamma felt sure you
          would."</p>
  <p>She lifted her eyes to his with an expression of
          gratitude: but for the habitual control to which she
          had schooled herself, a warmer feeling might have
          mingled with it. Mr. Carlyle nodded pleasantly, and
          then set off towards the house at the pace of a
          steam-engine.</p>
  <p>Two minutes in his dressing-chamber, and he entered the
          drawing-room, apologising for having kept them
          waiting dinner, and explaining that he had been
          compelled to go to his office to give some orders,
          subsequent to his return from Lynneborough. Lady
          Isabel's lips were pressed together, and she
          preserved an obstinate silence. Mr. Carlyle, in his
          unsuspicion, did not notice it.</p>
  <p>"What did Barbara Hare want?" demanded Miss Carlyle,
          during dinner.</p>
  <p>"She wanted to see me on business," was his reply, given
          in a tone that certainly did not invite his sister
          to <pb n="68"/> pursue the subject. "Will you take
          some more fish, Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"What was that you were reading over with her?" pursued
          the indefatigable Miss Corny. "It looked like a
          note."</p>
  <p>"Ah, that would be telling," returned Mr. Carlyle,
          willing to turn it off with gaiety. "If young ladies
          choose to make me privy to their love-letters, I
          cannot betray confidence, you know."</p>
  <p>"What rubbish, Archibald!" quoth she. "As if you could
          not say outright what Barbara wants, without making
          a mystery of it. And she seems to be always wanting
          you now."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced at his sister, a quick, peculiar
          look: it seemed, to her, to speak both of
          seriousness and warning. Involuntarily her
          thoughts—and her fears—flew back to the past.</p>
  <p>"Archibald! Archibald!" she uttered, repeating the name
          as if she could not get any further words out, in
          her dread. "It—it—is never—that old affair is never
          being reaped up again?"</p>
  <p>Now, Miss Carlyle's "old affair" referred to one sole and
          sore point—Richard Hare: and so Mr. Carlyle
          understood it. Lady Isabel unhappily believed that
          any "old affair" could but have reference to the
          bygone loves of her husband and Barbara.</p>
  <p>"You will oblige me by going on with your dinner,
          Cornelia," gravely responded Mr. Carlyle.
          Then—assuming a more laughing tone—"I tell you it is
          unreasonable to expect me to betray a young lady's
          secrets, although she may choose to confide them
          professionally to me. What say you, Captain
          Levison?"</p>
  <p>Captain Levison bowed; a smile of mockery, <pb n="69"/>
          all too perceptible to Lady Isabel, on his lip. And
          Miss Carlyle bent her head over her plate, and went
          on with her dinner as meek as any lamb.</p>
  <p>That same evening, Lady Isabel's indignant and rebellious
          heart condescended to speak of it when alone with
          her husband.</p>
  <p>"What is it that she wants with you so much, that Barbara
          Hare?"</p>
  <p>"It is private business, Isabel. She has to bring me
          messages from her mother."</p>
  <p>"Must the business be kept from me?"</p>
  <p>He was silent for a moment, considering whether he might
          tell her. But it was impossible he could speak, even
          to his wife, of the suspicion they were attaching to
          Captain Thorn, it would have been unfair and wrong:
          neither could he betray that a secret visit was
          expected from Richard. To no one would he betray
          that: unless Miss Corny, with her questioning, got
          it out of him: and she was safe and true.</p>
  <p>"It would not make you the happier to know it, Isabel.
          There is a dark secret, you are aware, touching the
          Hare family: it is connected with that."</p>
  <p>She did not put faith in a word of the reply. She
          believed he could not tell her because her feelings,
          as his wife, would be outraged by the confession:
          and it goaded her anger into recklessness. Mr.
          Carlyle, on his part, never gave a thought to the
          supposition that she might be jealous: he had
          believed that nonsense at an end years ago. He was
          perfectly honourable and true, giving her no shadow
          of cause or reason to be jealous of him: and, being
          a practical, matter-of-fact man, it did not occur to
          him that she could be so.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel was sitting the following morning, moody <pb n="70"/> and out of sorts. Captain Levison had
          accompanied Mr. Carlyle in the most friendly manner
          possible to the park gates on his departure, and
          then stolen along the hedge-walk. He returned to
          Lady Isabel with the news of an "ardent" interview
          with Barbara, who had been watching for Mr. Carlyle
          at the gate of the Grove. She sat, sullenly
          digesting the tidings, when a note was brought in.
          It proved to be an invitation to dinner for the
          following Tuesday, at a Mrs. Jeafferson's—for Mr.
          and Lady Isabel Carlyle and Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>She drew her desk towards her petulantly, to answer it on
          the spur of the moment, first of all passing the
          note across the table to Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Do you go?" asked Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Yes," replied Lady Isabel. "Mr. Carlyle and I both want
          a change of some sort," she added, in a mocking sort
          of spirit: "it may be as well to have it, if only
          for an evening." In truth, this unhappy jealousy,
          this distrust of her husband, appeared to have
          altered Lady Isabel's very nature.</p>
  <p>"And leave Captain Levison alone?" returned Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel bent over her desk, making no reply.</p>
  <p>"What will you do with him, I ask?" persisted Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"He can remain here: he can dine by himself. Shall I
          accept the invitation for you?"</p>
  <p>"No; I shall not go," said Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Then, in that case, there can be no difficulty with
          regard to Captain Levison," coldly spoke Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I don't want his company: I am not fond of it," cried
          Miss Carlyle. "I would go to Mrs. Jeafferson's, but
          that I should require a new dress."</p>
  <pb n="71"/>
  <p>"That's easily had," said Lady Isabel. "I shall want one
          myself."</p>
  <p>" <hi>You</hi> want a new dress!" uttered Miss Carlyle.
          "Why, you have dozens!"</p>
  <p>"I don't know that I could count a dozen in all,"
          returned Isabel, chafing at the remark, and the
          continual thwarting put upon her by Miss Carlyle,
          which had latterly seemed more than usually hard to
          endure. Petty ills try the temper worse than great
          ones.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel concluded her note, folded, sealed it, and
          then rang the bell. As the man left the room with
          it, she desired that Wilson might be sent to
          her.</p>
  <p>"Is it this morning, Wilson, that the dressmaker comes to
          try on Miss Isabel's dress?" she inquired.</p>
  <p>Wilson hesitated and stammered, and glanced from her
          mistress to Miss Carlyle. The latter looked up from
          her work.</p>
  <p>"The dressmaker's not coming," spoke she sharply. "I
          countermanded the order for the frock, for Isabel
          does not require it."</p>
  <p>"She does require it," answered Lady Isabel, in perhaps
          the most displeased tone she had ever used to Miss
          Carlyle. "I am a competent judge of what is
          necessary for my own children."</p>
  <p>"She no more requires a new frock than that table
          requires one, or than you require the one you are
          longing for," stoically persisted Miss Carlyle. "She
          has got ever so many lying by: and her striped silk,
          turned, will make up as handsome as ever."</p>
  <p>Wilson backed out of the room and closed the door softly,
          but her mistress caught a compassionate look
          directed towards her. Her heart felt bursting with
          indignation and despair: there seemed to be no side
          on <pb n="72"/> which she could turn for refuge.
          Pitied by her own servants!</p>
  <p>She reopened her desk, and dashed off a haughty,
          peremptory note for the attendance of the dressmaker
          at East Lynne, commanding its immediate
          despatch.</p>
  <p>Miss Corny groaned, in her wrath. "You will be sorry for
          not listening to me, ma'am, when your husband shall
          be brought to poverty. He works like a horse now;
          and, with all his slaving, can scarcely, I fear,
          keep expenses down."</p>
  <p>Poor Lady Isabel, ever sensitive, began to think they
          might, what with one thing and another, be spending
          more than Mr. Carlyle's means would justify: she
          knew their expenses were heavy. The same tale had
          been dinned into her ear ever since she married him.
          She gave up in that moment all thought of the new
          dress for herself and for Isabel: but her spirit, in
          her deep unhappiness, felt sick and faint within
          her.</p>
  <p>Wilson meanwhile had flown to Joyce's room, and was
          exercising her dearly-beloved tongue in an
          exaggerated account of the matter: how Miss Carlyle
          put upon my lady, and had forbidden a new dress to
          her, as well as the frock to Miss Isabel.</p>
  <p>Joyce, sitting up that day for the first time, was gazing
          from the window at Captain Levison as Wilson
          spoke.</p>
  <p>"He is a handsome man—to look at him from this," she
          observed.</p>
  <p>And yet a few more days passed on.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VIII. RICHARD HARE AT MR. DILL'S
          WINDOW.</head>
  <p><hi>Bright</hi> was the moon on that genial Monday night,
          bright was the evening star, as they shone upon a
          solitary wayfarer who walked on the shady side of
          the road, with his head down, as though he did not
          care to court observation. A labourer apparently,
          for he wore a smock-frock and had hobnails in his
          shoes; but his whiskers were large and black, quite
          hiding the lower part of his face, and his
          broad-brimmed "wide-awake" came far over his brows.
          He drew near the dwelling of Richard Hare, Esquire,
          plunged rapidly over some palings (after looking
          well to the right and left) into a field, and thence
          over the side wall into Mr. Hare's garden, where he
          remained amidst the thick trees.</p>
  <p>Now, by some mischievous spirit of intuition or
          contrariety, Justice Hare was spending this evening
          at home, a thing which did not happen once in six
          months, unless he had friends with him. Things, in
          real life, mostly go by the rules of contrary—as the
          children say in their play, holding the corners of
          the handkerchief. "Here we go round and round by the
          rules of conterrary: if I tell you to hold fast, you
          must loose: and if I tell you to loose, you must
          hold fast." Just so, in the play of life. When we
          want people to "hold fast," <pb n="74"/> they
          "loose;" and when we want them to loose, they hold
          fast.</p>
  <p>Barbara, anxious, troubled, worn out with the suspense of
          watching for her brother, would have given her head
          for her father to go out. But no: things were going
          by the rules of contrary: there sat the stern
          justice in full view of the garden and the grove,
          his chair drawn precisely in front of the window,
          his wig awry, and a long pipe in his mouth.</p>
  <p>"Are you not going out, Richard?" Mrs. Hare ventured to
          say.</p>
  <p>"No."</p>
  <p>"Mamma, shall I ring for the shutters to be closed?"
          asked Barbara, by-and-by.</p>
  <p>"Shutters closed!" said the justice. "Who'd shut out this
          bright moon? You have got the lamp at the far end of
          the room, young lady, and can go to it."</p>
  <p>Barbara ejaculated an inward prayer for patience— for
          safety for Richard, if he did come, and waited on,
          watching the grove in the distance. It came, the
          signal; her quick eye caught it; a movement as if
          some person or thing had stepped out beyond the
          trees and stepped back again. Barbara's face turned
          white and her lips dry.</p>
  <p>"I am so hot!" she ejaculated, in her confused eagerness
          for an excuse; "I must take a turn in the
          garden."</p>
  <p>She stole out, throwing a dark shawl over her shoulders,
          that it might render her less conspicuous to the
          justice, and her dress that evening was a dark silk.
          She did not dare to stand still when she reached the
          trees, or to penetrate them, but she caught glimpses
          of Richard's face, and her heart ached at the change
          in it.</p>
  <pb n="75"/>
  <p>It was white, thin, and full of care; and his hair, he
          told her, was turning grey.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard, darling, I may not stop and talk to you!"
          she wailed, in a deep whisper. "Papa is at home, you
          see, of all nights in the world."</p>
  <p>"Can't I see my mother?"</p>
  <p>"How can you? You must wait till to-morrow night."</p>
  <p>"I don't like waiting a second night, Barbara. There's
          danger in every inch of ground that this
          neighbourhood contains."</p>
  <p>"But you must wait, Richard; for reasons. That man who
          caused all the mischief, Thorn—"</p>
  <p>"Hang him!" gloomily interrupted Richard.</p>
  <p>"He is at West Lynne. At least, there is a Thorn here
          whom we, I and Mr. Carlyle, believe to be the same,
          and we want you to see him."</p>
  <p>"Let me see him," panted Richard, whom the news appeared
          to agitate, "let me see him! Barbara—I say—"</p>
  <p>Barbara had passed on again, returning presently. "You
          know, Richard, I must keep moving, with papa's eyes
          there. He is a tall man, very good-looking, very
          fond of dress and ornaments, especially of
          diamonds."</p>
  <p>"That's he," cried Richard, eagerly.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle will contrive that you shall see him," she
          continued, stooping down as if to tie her shoe.
          "Should it prove to be the same, perhaps nothing can
          be immediately done towards clearing you, but it
          will be a great point ascertained. Are you sure you
          should know him again?"</p>
  <p>"Sure! that I should know <hi>him!</hi> " uttered Richard
            <pb n="76"/> Hare. "Should I know my own father?
          should I know you? And you are not engraven on my
          heart in letters of blood, as he is. How and when am
          I to see him, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"I can tell you nothing till I have consulted Mr.
          Carlyle. Be here to-morrow as soon as ever the dusk
          will permit you: perhaps Mr. Carlyle will contrive
          to bring him here. If—"</p>
  <p>The window was thrown open, and the stentorian voice of
          Justice Hare was heard from it.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, are you wandering about there to take cold?
          Come in. Come in, I say."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard, I am so sorry!" she lingered to whisper.
          "But papa is sure to be out to-morrow evening: he
          would not stay in two evenings running. Good night,
          dear."</p>
  <p>There must be no delay now, and the next day Barbara,
          braving comments, appeared once more at the office
          of Mr. Carlyle. Terribly did the rules of contrary
          seem in action just then: Mr. Carlyle was not in,
          and the clerks did not know when to expect him: he
          was gone out for some hours, they believed.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Dill," urged Barbara, as the old gentleman came to
          the door to greet her, "I <hi>must</hi> see
          him."</p>
  <p>"He will not be in till late in the afternoon, Miss
          Barbara. I expect him then. Is it anything I can
          do?"</p>
  <p>"No, no," sighed Barbara.</p>
  <p>At that moment Lady Isabel and her little girl passed in
          the chariot. She saw Barbara at her husband's door:
          what should she be doing there, unless paying him a
          visit? A slight, haughty bow to Barbara, <pb n="77"/> a pleasant nod and smile to Mr. Dill, and the
          carriage bowled on.</p>
  <p>It was four o'clock before Barbara could see Mr. Carlyle.
          She communicated her tidings, that Richard had
          arrived.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle held deceit and all underhanded doings in
          especial abhorrence: yet he deemed that he was
          acting right, under the circumstances, in allowing
          Captain Thorn to be secretly seen by Richard Hare.
          In haste he arranged his plans. It was the evening
          of his own dinner engagement at Mrs. Jeafferson's:
          but, that he must give up. Telling Barbara to
          despatch Richard to his office as soon as he should
          make his appearance in the grove, and to urge him to
          come boldly, for that none would know him in his
          disguise, he wrote a hurried note to Thorn,
          requesting him also to be at his office at eight
          o'clock that evening, as he had something to
          communicate to him. The latter plea was no fiction,
          for he had received an important communication that
          morning relative to the business on which Captain
          Thorn had consulted him, and his own absence from
          the office had alone prevented his sending for him
          earlier.</p>
  <p>Other matters were calling the attention of Mr. Carlyle,
          and it was five o'clock ere he departed for East
          Lynne: he would not have gone so early, but that he
          must inform his wife of his inability to keep the
          dinner engagement. Mr. Carlyle was one who never
          hesitated to sacrifice personal gratification to
          friendship or to business.</p>
  <p>The chariot was at the door, and Lady Isabel was dressed
          and waiting for him in her dressing-room. <pb n="78"/> "Did you forget that the Jeaffersons dine at
          six?" was her greeting.</p>
  <p>"No, Isabel; but it was impossible for me to get here
          before. And I should not have come so soon, but to
          tell you that I cannot accompany you. You must make
          my excuses to Mrs. Jeafferson."</p>
  <p>A pause. Strange thoughts were running through Lady
          Isabel's mind. "Why so?" she inquired.</p>
  <p>"Some business has arisen which I am compelled to attend
          to this evening. As soon as I have snatched my
          dinner at home I must hasten back to the
          office."</p>
  <p>Was he making this excuse to spend the hours of her
          absence with Barbara Hare? The idea that it was so
          took firm possession of her mind, and remained
          there. Her face expressed a variety of feelings, the
          most prominent that of resentment. Mr. Carlyle saw
          it.</p>
  <p>"You must not be vexed, Isabel. I assure you it is no
          fault of mine. It is important private business
          which cannot be put off, and which I cannot delegate
          to Dill. I am sorry it should so have happened."</p>
  <p>"You never return to the office in an evening," she
          remarked, with pale lips.</p>
  <p>"No: because, if anything arises to take us there after
          hours, Dill officiates. But the business to-night
          must be done by myself."</p>
  <p>Another pause. Lady Isabel sullenly broke it. "Shall you
          join us later in the evening?"</p>
  <p>"I believe I shall not be able to do so."</p>
  <p>She drew her light shawl round her shoulders, and swept
          down the staircase. Mr. Carlyle followed, to place
          her in the carriage. When he said farewell she never
          answered, but looked straight out before her with a
          stony look.</p>
  <pb n="79"/>
  <p>"What time, my lady?" inquired the footman, as she
          alighted at Mrs. Jefferson's.</p>
  <p>"Early. Half-past nine."</p>
  <p>A little before eight o'clock, Richard Hare, in his smock
          frock, his slouching hat, and his false whiskers,
          rang dubiously at the outer door of Mr. Carlyle's
          office. That gentleman instantly opened it. He was
          quite alone.</p>
  <p>"Come in, Richard," said he, grasping his hand. "Did you
          meet many whom you knew?"</p>
  <p>"I never looked whom I met, sir," was the reply. "I
          thought if I looked at people, they might look at
          me, so I came straight ahead with may eyes before
          me. How the place is altered! There's a new brick
          house at the corner where old Morgan's shop used to
          be."</p>
  <p>"That's the new police station: West Lynne, I assure you,
          is becoming grand in public buildings. And how have
          you been, Richard?"</p>
  <p>"Ailing and wretched," answered Richard Hare. "How can I
          be otherwise, Mr. Carlyle, with so false an
          accusation attaching to me; and working like a
          slave, as I have to do?"</p>
  <p>"You may take off that disfiguring hat, Richard. No one
          is here."</p>
  <p>Richard slowly heaved it from his brows, and his fair
          face, so like his mother's, was disclosed. But the
          moment he was uncovered, he turned shrinkingly
          towards the entrance door. "If any one should come
          in, sir!"</p>
  <p>"Impossible," replied Mr. Carlyle. "The front door is
          fast, and the office is supposed to be empty at this
          hour."</p>
  <p>"For, if I should be seen and recognised, it might <pb n="80"/> come to hanging, you know, sir. You are
          expecting that cursed Thorn here, Barbara told
          me."</p>
  <p>"Directly," replied Mr. Carlyle, observing the mode of
          addressing him "sir." It spoke plainly of the scale
          of society in which Richard must be mixing: that he
          was with those who said it habitually; that he used
          it habitually himself. "From your description of the
          Lieutenant Thorn who destroyed Hallijohn, we believe
          this Captain Thorn to be the same man," pursued Mr.
          Carlyle. "In person he appears to tally exactly; and
          I have ascertained that some years ago he was a
          great deal at Swainson, and got into some sort of
          scrape. He is in John Herbert's regiment, and is
          here with him on a visit."</p>
  <p>"But what an idiot he must be to venture here!" uttered
          Richard. "Here, of all places in the world!"</p>
  <p>"He counts, no doubt, upon not being known. So far as I
          can find out, Richard, nobody here knew him, save
          you and Afy. I shall put you in Mr. Dill's room—you
          may remember the little window in it—and from thence
          you can take full view of Thorn, whom I shall keep
          in the front office. You are sure you would
          recognise him, at this distance of time?"</p>
  <p>"I should know him if it were fifty years to come; I
          should know him were he disguised as I am disguised.
          We cannot," Richard sank his voice, "forget a man
          who has been the object of our frenzied
          jealousy."</p>
  <p>"What has brought you to West Lynne again, Richard? Any
          particular object?"</p>
  <p>"Chiefly a hankering within me that I could not get rid
          of," replied Richard. "It was not so much to see my
          mother and Barbara—though I have longed to see them
          since my illness—but a feeling was within me <pb n="81"/> that I could not rest away from it. So I
          said I'd risk it again, just for a day."</p>
  <p>"I thought you might possibly want some assistance, as
          before."</p>
  <p>"I do want that also," said Richard. "Not much. My
          illness has run me into debt, and if my mother can
          let me have a little I shall be thankful."</p>
  <p>"I am sure she will," answered Mr. Carlyle. "You shall
          have it from me to-night. What has been the matter
          with you?"</p>
  <p>"The beginning of it was a kick from a horse, sir. That
          was last winter, and it laid me up for six weeks.
          Then, in the spring, after I had got well and was at
          work again, I caught some sort of fever, and down
          again I was for six weeks. I have not been to say
          well since."</p>
  <p>"How is it you have never written, or sent me your
          address?"</p>
  <p>"Because I dare not," answered Richard, timorously. "I
          should always be in fear; not of you, Mr. Carlyle,
          but of its becoming known in some way or other. The
          time is getting on, sir: is that Thorn sure to
          come?"</p>
  <p>"He sent me word that he would, in reply to my note.
          And—there he is!" said Mr. Carlyle, as a ring was
          heard at the bell. "Now, Richard, come this way.
          Bring your hat."</p>
  <p>Richard complied by putting the hat on his head, pulling
          it so low down that it touched his nose. He felt
          himself safer in it. Mr. Carlyle showed him into Mr.
          Dill's room, and then turned the key upon him, and
          put it in his pocket. Whether this precautionary
          measure was intended to prevent any possibility of
            <pb n="82"/> Captain Thorn's finding his way in,
          or of Richard finding his way out, was best known to
          himself.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle went to the front door, opened it, and
          admitted Captain Thorn. He brought him into the
          clerk's office, which was bright with gas, keeping
          him in conversation for a few minutes standing, and
          then asking him to be seated: all in few view of the
          little window.</p>
  <p>"I must beg your pardon for being late," Captain Thorn
          observed. "I am half an hour beyond the time you
          mentioned, but the Herberts had two or three friends
          at dinner, and I could not get away. I hope, Mr.
          Carlyle, you have not come to your office to-night
          purposely for me."</p>
  <p>"Business must be attended to," somewhat evasively
          answered Mr. Carlyle: "I have been out myself nearly
          all day. We received a communication from London
          this morning, relative to your affair, and I am
          sorry to say it is anything but satisfactory. They
          will not wait."</p>
  <p>"But I am not liable, Mr. Carlyle. Not liable in
          justice."</p>
  <p>"No—if what you tell me be correct. But justice and law
          are sometimes in opposition, Captain Thorn."</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn sat in perplexity. "They will not get me
          arrested here, will they?"</p>
  <p>"They would have done it, beyond doubt; but I have caused
          a letter to be written and despatched to them, which
          must bring forth an answer before any violent
          proceedings are taken. That answer will be here the
          morning after to-morrow."</p>
  <p>"And what am I to do then?"</p>
  <p>"I think it probable there may be a way then of <pb n="83"/> checkmating them. But I am not sure,
          Captain Thorn, that I can give my attention further
          to this affair."</p>
  <p>"I hope and trust you will," was the reply.</p>
  <p>"You have not forgotten that I told you, at first, I
          could not promise to do so," rejoined Mr. Carlyle.
          "You shall hear from me to-morrow. If I carry it on
          for you, I will then appoint an hour for you to be
          here the following day: if not—why, I dare say you
          will find a solicitor as capable of assisting you as
          I am."</p>
  <p>"But why will you not? What is the reason?"</p>
  <p>"I cannot always give reasons for what I do," was the
          response. "You shall hear from me to-morrow."</p>
  <p>He rose as he spoke; Captain Thorn also rose. Mr. Carlyle
          detained him yet a few moments, and then saw him out
          at the front door and fastened it.</p>
  <p>He returned and released Richard. The latter took off his
          hat as he advanced into the blaze of light.</p>
  <p>"Well Richard, is it the same man?"</p>
  <p>"No, sir. Nor in the least like him."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt a strange relief; relief for Captain
          Thorn's sake. He had rarely seen one whom he could
          so little associate with the notion of a murderer as
          Captain Thorn, and he was a man who exceedingly won
          upon his regard. He could heartily help him out of
          his dilemma now.</p>
  <p>"Excepting that they are both tall, with nearly the same
          coloured hair, there is no resemblance whatever
          between them," proceeded Richard. "Their faces,
          their figures are as opposite as light is from dark.
          That other, in spite of his handsome features, has
          the expression at times of a demon; but the
          expression of this one is the best part of his face.
          Hallijohn's murderer had a curious look here,
          sir."</p>
  <pb n="84"/>
  <p>"Where?" questioned Mr. Carlyle, for Richard had only
          pointed to his face generally.</p>
  <p>"Well—I cannot say precisely where it lay, whether in the
          eyebrows or the eyes: I could not tell when I used
          to have him before me: but it was in one of them.
          Ah, Mr. Carlyle, I thought when Barbara told me
          Thorn was here, it was too good news to be true;
          depend on't he won't venture to West Lynne again.
          This man is no more like that other villain than you
          are like him."</p>
  <p>"Then—as that is set at rest—we had better be going,
          Richard. You have to see your mother, and she must
          be waiting in anxiety. How much money do you
          want?"</p>
  <p>"Twenty-five pounds would do, but—" Richard stopped in
          hesitation.</p>
  <p>"But what?" asked Mr. Carlyle. "Speak out, Richard."</p>
  <p>"Thirty would be more welcome. Thirty would put me at
          ease."</p>
  <p>"You shall have thirty," said Mr. Carlyle, counting over
          the notes to him. "Now—will you walk with me to the
          Grove, or will you walk alone? I mean to see you
          there in safety."</p>
  <p>Richard thought he would prefer to walk alone; everybody
          they met might be speaking to Mr. Carlyle. The
          latter inquired why he chose moonlight nights for
          his visits.</p>
  <p>"It is pleasanter for night travelling. And, had I chosen
          dark, nights, Barbara could not have seen my signal
          from the trees," was the answer of Richard.</p>
  <p>They went out, and proceeded unmolested to the house of
          Justice Hare. It was past nine then. "I am <pb n="85"/> so much obliged to you, Mr. Carlyle,"
          whispered Richard, as they walked up the path.</p>
  <p>"I wish I could help you more effectually, Richard, and
          clear up the mystery. Is Barbara on the watch? Yes;
          the door is slowly opening."</p>
  <p>Richard stole across the hall and into the parlour to his
          mother. Barbara approached and softly whispered Mr.
          Carlyle, standing just outside the portico: her
          voice trembled with the suspense of what the answer
          might be.</p>
  <p>"Is it the same man? The same Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"No. Richard says this man bears no resemblance to the
          real one."</p>
  <p>"Oh!" uttered Barbara, in her surprise and
          disappointment. "Not the same! and for the best part
          of poor Richard's evening to have been taken up for
          nothing."</p>
  <p>"Not quite for nothing," said Mr. Carlyle. "The question
          is now set at rest."</p>
  <p>"Set at rest!" repeated Barbara. "It is left in more
          uncertainty than ever."</p>
  <p>"Set at rest as regards Captain Thorn. And whilst our
          suspicions were concentrated upon him, we did not
          look to other quarters."</p>
  <p>When they entered the sitting-room, Mrs. Hare was crying
          over Richard, and Richard was crying over her: but
          she seized the hand of Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"You have been very kind: I don't know whatever we should
          do without you. And I want to tax your kindness yet
          further. Has Barbara mentioned it?"</p>
  <p>"I could not talk in the hall, mamma: the servants might
          have overheard."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Hare is not well, and we terribly fear he will <pb n="86"/> be home early, in consequence: otherwise
          we should have been quite safe until ten, for he is
          gone to the Buck's Head, and they never leave, you
          know, till that hour has struck. Should he come in
          and see Richard—the very thought sends me into a
          shiver. Barbara and I have been discussing it all
          the evening, and we can only think of one plan. It
          is, that you will kindly stay in the garden near the
          gate; and, should he come, in stop him and keep him
          in conversation. Barbara will be with you, and will
          run in with the warning, and Richard can go inside
          the closet in the hall, till Mr. Hare has entered
          and is safe in this room, and then he can make his
          escape. Will you do this Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly I will."</p>
  <p>"I cannot part with him before ten o'clock, unless I am
          obliged," she whispered, pressing Mr. Carlyle's
          hands in her earnest gratitude. "You don't know what
          it is, Archibald, to have a lost son home for an
          hour but once in seven years. At ten o'clock we will
          part."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle and Barbara began to pace the path, in
          compliance with the wishes of Mrs. Hare, keeping
          near the entrance gate. When they were turning the
          second time, Mr. Carlyle offered her his arm: it was
          an act of mere politeness. Barbara took it: and
          there they waited and waited, but the justice did
          not come.</p>
  <p>Punctually to the minute, half after nine, Lady Isabel's
          carriage arrived at Mrs. Jeafferson's, and she came
          out immediately, a headache being the plea for her
          early departure. She had not far to go to reach East
          Lynne, about two miles: it was a by-road nearly all
          the way. They could emerge into the open road if <pb n="87"/> they pleased, but it was a trifle
          further. Suddenly a gentleman approached the
          carriage as it was bowling along, and waved his hand
          to the coachman to pull up. In spite of the glowing
          moonlight, Lady Isabel did not at first recognise
          him, for he wore a disfiguring fur cap, the ears of
          which were tied over his ears and cheeks. It was
          Francis Levison. She put down the window.</p>
  <p>"I thought it must be your carriage. How early you are
          returning! Were you tired of your entertainers?"</p>
  <p>"Why, he knew what time my lady was returning," thought
          John to himself; "he asked me. A false sort of chap,
          that, I've a notion."</p>
  <p>"I came out for a stroll, and have tired myself," he
          proceeded. "Will you take compassion on me and give
          me a seat home?"</p>
  <p>She acquiesced; she could not well do otherwise. The
          footman sprang from behind, to open the door, and
          Francis Levison took his place beside Lady Isabel.
          "Take the high road," he put out his head to say to
          the coachman, and the man touched his hat. Which
          high road would cause them to pass Mr. Hare's.</p>
  <p>"I did not know you," she began, gathering herself into
          her own corner. "What ugly thing is that you have
          on? It is like a disguise."</p>
  <p>He was taking off the "ugly thing" as she spoke, and
          began to twirl it round on his hand. "Disguise? Oh
          no: I have no creditors in the immediate
          neighbourhood of East Lynne."</p>
  <p>False as ever. It <hi>was</hi> worn as a disguise, and he
          knew it.</p>
  <p>"Is Mr. Carlyle at home?" she inquired.</p>
  <pb n="88"/>
  <p>"No." Then, after a pause—"I expect he is more agreeably
          engaged."</p>
  <p>The tone brought the tingling blood to the cheeks of Lady
          Isabel. She wished to preserve a dignified silence;
          and did so for a few moments: but the jealous
          question broke out.</p>
  <p>"Engaged in what manner?"</p>
  <p>"As I came by Hare's house just now, I saw two people, a
          gentleman and a young lady, coupled lovingly
          together, enjoying a <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> by
          moonlight. They were your husband and Miss
          Hare."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel almost gnashed her teeth: the jealous doubts
          which had been tormenting her all the evening were
          confirmed. That the man whom she hated—yes, in her
          blind anger, she hated him then—should so impose
          upon her, should excuse himself by lies, lies base
          and false, from accompanying her, on purpose to pass
          the hours with Barbara Hare! Had she been alone in
          the carriage, a torrent of passion had probably
          escaped her.</p>
  <p>She leaned back, panting in her emotion, but concealed it
          from Captain Levison. As they came opposite to
          Justice Hare's, she deliberately bent forward, and
          scanned the garden with eager eyes.</p>
  <p>There, in the bright moonlight, all too bright and clear,
          slowly paced, arm in arm, and drawn close to each
          other, her husband and Barbara. With a choking sob
          that could no longer be controlled or hidden, Lady
          Isabel sank back again.</p>
  <p>He, that bold bad man, dare to put his arm round her; to
          draw her to his side; to whisper that <hi>his</hi>
          love was left to her, if another's was withdrawn.
          She was <pb n="89"/> most assuredly out of her
          senses that night, or she never would have
          listened.</p>
  <p>A jealous woman is mad; an outraged woman is doubly mad;
          and the ill-fated Lady Isabel truly believed that
          every sacred feeling which ought to exist between
          man and wife, was betrayed by Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Be avenged on that false hound, Isabel. He was never
          worthy of you. Leave your life of misery, and come
          to happiness."</p>
  <p>In her bitter distress and wrath, she broke into a storm
          of sobs. Were they caused by passion against her
          husband, or by these bold and shameless words? Alas!
          alas! Francis Levison applied himself to soothe her
          with all the sweet and dangerous sophistry of his
          crafty nature.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER IX. NEVER TO BE REDEEMED.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> minutes flew on. A quarter to ten; ten; a
          quarter past ten; and still Richard Hare lingered on
          with his mother, and still Mr. Carlyle and Barbara
          paced patiently the garden path. At half-past ten
          Richard came forth, having taken his last farewell.
          Then came Barbara's tearful farewell, which Mr.
          Carlyle witnessed; then a hard grasp of that
          gentleman's hand, and Richard plunged amidst the
          trees, to depart the way he came.</p>
  <p>"Good night, Barbara," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Will you not come in and say good night to mamma?"</p>
  <p>"Not now; it is late Tell her how glad I am things have
          gone off so well."</p>
  <p>He set off at a rapid pace towards his home, and Barbara
          leaned on the gate to indulge her tears. Not a soul
          passed to interrupt her, and the justice did not
          come. What could have become of him? What could the
          Buck's Head be thinking of, to detain respectable
          elderly justices from their beds, who ought to go
          home early and set a good example to the parish?
          Barbara knew, the next day, that Justice Hare, with
          a few more gentlemen, had been seduced from the
          staid <pb n="91"/> old inn to a friend's house, to
          an entertainment of supper, pipes, and whist, two
          tables, six-penny points, and it was between twelve
          and one ere the party rose from the fascination. So
          far, well—as it happened.</p>
  <p>Barbara knew not how long she lingered at that gate; ten
          minutes it may have been. Nobody summoned her; Mrs.
          Hare was indulging her grief indoors, giving no
          thought to Barbara, and the justice did not make his
          appearance. Exceedingly surprised was Barbara to
          hear fast footsteps, and to find that they were Mr.
          Carlyle's.</p>
  <p>"The more haste, the less speed, Barbara," he called out
          as he came up. "I had got half way home, and have
          had to come back again. When I went into your
          sitting-room, I left a small parcel, containing a
          parchment, on the sideboard. Will you get it for
          me?"</p>
  <p>Barbara ran in-doors and brought forth the parcel; and
          Mr. Carlyle, with a brief word of thanks, sped away
          with it.</p>
  <p>She leaned on the gate as before, the ready tears flowing
          again: her heart was aching for Richard: it was
          aching for the disappointment the night had brought
          forth, respecting Captain Thorn. Still nobody
          passed; still the steps of her father were not
          heard, and Barbara stayed on. But—what was that
          figure, cowering under shade of the hedge at a
          distance, and, seemingly, watching her? Barbara
          strained her eyes, while her heart beat as if it
          would burst its bounds. Surely, surely, it was her
          brother! What had he ventured back for?</p>
  <p>Richard Hare it was. When fully assured that Barbara was
          standing there, he knew the justice was still
          absent, and ventured to advance. He appeared to <pb n="92"/> be in a strange state of emotion, his
          breath laboured, his whole frame trembling.</p>
  <p>"Barbara! Barbara!" he ejaculated, "I have seen
          Thorn."</p>
  <p>Barbara thought him demented. "I know you saw him," she
          slowly said; "but it was not the right Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Not he," breathed Richard; "not the gentleman I saw
          to-night in Carlyle's office. I have seen the fellow
          himself. Why do you stare so at me, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>Barbara was in truth scanning his face keenly. It
          appeared to her a strange tale that he was
          telling.</p>
  <p>"When I left here, I cut across into Bean-lane, which is
          more private for me than this road," proceeded
          Richard. "Just as I got to that clump of trees—you
          know it, Barbara—I saw somebody coming towards me
          from a distance. I stepped back behind the trunks of
          the trees, into the shade of the hedge, for I don't
          care to be met, though I am disguised. He came along
          the middle of the lane, going towards West Lynne,
          and I looked out upon him. I knew him long before he
          was abreast of me: it was Thorn."</p>
  <p>Barbara made no comment: she was digesting the news.</p>
  <p>"Every drop of blood within me began to tingle, and an
          impulse came upon me to spring upon him and accuse
          him of the murder of Hallijohn," went on Richard, in
          the same excited manner. "But I restrained it: or,
          perhaps, my courage failed. One of the reproaches
          against me, had used to be that I was a physical
          coward, you know, Barbara," he added, his tone
          changing to bitterness. "In a struggle, Thorn would
          have had the best of it: he is taller and more <pb n="93"/> powerful than I, and might have battered
          me to death. A man who can commit one murder, won't
          hesitate at a second."</p>
  <p>"Richard, do you think you could have been deceived?" she
          urged. "You had been talking of Thorn, and your
          thoughts were, naturally, bearing upon him.
          Imagination—"</p>
  <p>"Be still, Barbara!" he interrupted, in a tone of pain.
          "Imagination, indeed! did I not tell you he was
          stamped here?" touching his breast. "Do you take me
          for a child, or an imbecile, that I should fancy I
          see Thorn in every shadow, or meet people where I do
          not? He had his hat off as if he had been walking
          fast and had got hot—he was walking fast, and he
          carried the hat in one hand, and what looked like a
          small parcel. With the other hand he was pushing his
          hair from his brow—in this way, a peculiar way,"
          added Richard, slightly lifting his own hat, and
          pushing back his hair. "By that action alone I
          should have known him, for he was always doing it in
          the old days. And there was his white hand, adorned
          with his diamond ring! Barbara, the diamond
          glittered in the moonlight."</p>
  <p>Richard's voice and manner were singularly earnest, and a
          conviction of the truth of his assertion flashed
          over his sister.</p>
  <p>"I saw his face as plainly as I ever saw it, every
          feature: he is scarcely altered, save for a
          haggardness in his cheeks now. Barbara, you need not
          doubt me: I swear it was Thorn."</p>
  <p>She grew excited as he was; now that she believed the
          news, it was telling upon her: reason left its
          place, <pb n="94"/> and impulse succeeded: Barbara
          did not wait to weigh her actions.</p>
  <p>"Richard, Mr. Carlyle ought to know this. He has but just
          gone: we may overtake him if we try."</p>
  <p>Forgetting the strange appearance it would have, at that
          hour of the night, should she meet any one who knew
          her, forgetting what the consequences might be, did
          Justice Hare return and find her absent, Barbara set
          off with a fleet foot, Richard more stealthily
          following her, his eyes cast in all directions.
          Fortunately Barbara wore a bonnet and mantle, which
          she had put on to pace the garden with Mr. Carlyle;
          fortunately also, they met no one. She succeeded in
          reaching Mr. Carlyle before he turned into East
          Lynne gates.</p>
  <p>"Barbara!" he exclaimed, in the extreme of astonishment.
          "Barbara!"</p>
  <p>"Archibald! Archibald!" she panted, gasping for breath.
          "I am not out of my mind; but do come and speak to
          Richard! He has just seen the real Thorn."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, amazed and wondering, turned back. They got
          over the field stile nearly opposite to the gates,
          drew behind the hedge, and there Richard told his
          tale. Mr. Carlyle did not appear to doubt it, as
          Barbara had done: perhaps he could not, in the face
          of Richard's agitated and intense earnestness.</p>
  <p>"I am sure there is no one named Thorn in the
          neighbourhood, save the gentleman you saw in my
          office to-night, Richard," observed Mr. Carlyle,
          after some deliberation. "It is very strange."</p>
  <p>"He may be staying here under a feigned name," replied
          Richard. "There can be no mistake that it is Thorn
          whom I have just met."</p>
  <p>"How was he dressed? As a gentleman?"</p>
  <pb n="95"/>
  <p>"Catch him dressing as anything else," returned Richard.
          "He was in an evening suit of black, with a sort of
          thin over-coat thrown on, but it was flung back at
          the shoulders, and I distinctly saw his clothes. A
          grey alpaca, it looked like. As I have told Barbara,
          I should have known him by this action of the hand,"
          imitating it, "as he pashed his hair off his
          forehead: it was the delicate white hand of the days
          gone by, Mr. Carlyle; it was the flashing diamond
          ring."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was silent; Barbara also; but the thoughts of
          both were busy. "Richard," observed the former, "I
          should advise you to remain a day or two in the
          neighbourhood, and look out for this man. You may
          see him again, and may track him home: it is very
          desirable to find out who he really is, if
          practicable."</p>
  <p>"But the danger?" urged Richard.</p>
  <p>"Your fears magnify that. I am quite certain that nobody
          would know you in broad daylight, disguised as you
          are now. So many years have flown since, that people
          have forgotten to think about you, Richard."</p>
  <p>But Richard could not be persuaded; he was full of fears.
          He described the man as accurately as he could to
          Mr. Carlyle and Barbara, and told them <hi>they</hi>
          must look out. With some trouble Mr. Carlyle got
          from him an address in London to which he might
          write, in case anything turned up, and Richard's
          presence should be necessary. He then once more said
          farewell, and quitted them, his way lying past East
          Lynne.</p>
  <p>"And now to see you back, Barbara," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Indeed you shall not do it, late as it is, and tired as
          you must be. I came here alone: Richard did not keep
          near me."</p>
  <pb n="96"/>
  <p>"I cannot help your having come here alone, but you may
          rely upon it I do not suffer you to go back so.
          Nonsense, Barbara! Allow you to go along the high
          road by yourself at eleven o'clock at night! What
          are you thinking of?"</p>
  <p>He gave Barbara his arm, and they pursued their way. "How
          late Lady Isabel will think you!" observed
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"I do not know that Lady Isabel has returned home yet. My
          being late once in a way is of no consequence."</p>
  <p>Not another word was spoken, save by Barbara. "Whatever
          excuse can I make, should papa be come home?" Both
          were buried in their own reflections. "Thank you
          very greatly," she said as they reached the gate,
          and Mr. Carlyle finally turned away. Barbara stole
          in, and found the coast clear: her papa had not
          arrived.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel was in her dressing-room when Mr. Carlyle
          entered: she was seated at a table, writing. A few
          questions as to her evening's visit, which she
          answered in the briefest manner possible, and then
          he asked her if she was not going to bed.</p>
  <p>"By-and-by. I am not sleepy."</p>
  <p>"I must go at once, Isabel, for I am dead tired."</p>
  <p>"You can go," was her answer.</p>
  <p>He bent down to kiss her, but she dexterously turned her
          face away. He supposed she felt hurt that he had not
          gone with her to the party, and placed his hand on
          her shoulder with a pleasant smile.</p>
  <p>"You foolish child, to be aggrieved at that! It was no
          fault of mine, Isabel: I could not help myself. I
            <pb n="97"/> will talk to you in the morning: I am
          too tired to-night. I suppose you will not be
          long."</p>
  <p>Her head was bent over her writing again, and she made no
          reply. Mr. Carlyle went into the bedroom and shut
          the door. Some time after, Lady Isabel went softly
          up-stairs to Joyce's room. Joyce, in her first
          sleep, was suddenly aroused from it. There stood her
          mistress, a wax light in her hand. Joyce rubbed her
          eyes and collected her senses, and finally sat up in
          bed.</p>
  <p>"My lady! Are you ill?"</p>
  <p>"Ill? Yes; ill and wretched," answered Lady Isabel: and
          ill she looked, for she was perfectly white. "Joyce,
          I want a promise from you. If anything should happen
          to me, stay at East Lynne with my children."</p>
  <p>Joyce stared in amazement, too astonished to make any
          reply.</p>
  <p>"Joyce, you promised it once before: promise it again.
          Whatever betide, you will stay with my children when
          I am gone."</p>
  <p>"I will stay with them. But, oh my lady, what can be the
          matter with you? Are you taken suddenly ill?"</p>
  <p>"Good bye, Joyce," murmured Lady Isabel, gliding from the
          chamber as softly as she had entered it. And Joyce,
          after an hour of perplexity, dropped asleep
          again.</p>
  <p>Joyce was not the only one whose rest was disturbed that
          eventful night. Mr. Carlyle himself awoke, and to
          his surprise found that his wife had not come to
          bed. He wondered what the time was, and struck his
          repeater. A quarter-past three!</p>
  <p>Rising, he made his way to the door of his wife's <pb n="98"/> dressing-room. It was in darkness; and,
          so far as he could judge by absence of sound,
          unoccupied.</p>
  <p>"Isabel."</p>
  <p>No reply. Nothing but the echo of his own voice in the
          silence of the night.</p>
  <p>He struck a match and lighted a taper, partially dressed
          himself, and went out to look for her. He feared she
          might have been taken ill: or else that she had
          fallen asleep in one of the rooms. But nowhere could
          he find her, and, feeling perplexed, he proceeded to
          his sister's chamber door and knocked.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle was a light sleeper, and rose up in bed at
          once. "Who's that?" called out she.</p>
  <p>"It is only I, Cornelia," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"You!" ejaculated Miss Corny, "what in the name of
          fortune do you want? You can come in."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle opened the door, and met the keen eyes of his
          sister, bent on him from the bed. Her head was
          surmounted by a remarkable night-cap, at least a
          foot high.</p>
  <p>"Is anybody ill?" she demanded.</p>
  <p>"I think Isabel must be. I cannot find her."</p>
  <p>"Not find her!" echoed Miss Corny. "Why, what's the time?
          Is she not in bed?"</p>
  <p>"It is three o'clock. She has not been to bed. I cannot
          find her in the sitting-rooms; neither is she in the
          children's room."</p>
  <p>"Then I'll tell you what it is, Archibald; she's gone
          worrying after Joyce. Perhaps the girl may be in
          pain to-night."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was in full retreat towards Joyce's room, at
          this suggestion, when his sister called to him.</p>
  <p>"If anything is amiss with Joyce, you come and tell <pb n="99"/> me, Archibald, for I shall get up and see
          after her. The girl was my servant before she was
          your wife's."</p>
  <p>He reached Joyce's room and softly unlatched the door,
          fully expecting to find a light there, and his wife
          sitting by the bedside. There was no light, however,
          save that which came from the taper he held, and he
          saw no signs of his wife. <hi>Where</hi> was she?
          Was it probable that Joyce could tell him? He
          stepped inside the room and called to her.</p>
  <p>Joyce started up in a fright, which changed to
          astonishment when she recognised her master. He
          inquired whether Lady Isabel had been there, and for
          a few moments Joyce did not answer. She had been
          dreaming of Lady Isabel, and could not at first
          detach the dream from the visit which had probably
          given rise to it.</p>
  <p>"What did you say, sir? Is my lady worse?"</p>
  <p>"I ask if she had been here. I cannot find her."</p>
  <p>"Why yes," said Joyce, now fully aroused. "She came here
          and woke me. That was just before twelve, for I
          heard the clock strike. She did not stay here a
          minute, sir."</p>
  <p>"Woke you!" repeated Mr. Carlyle. "What did she want?
          what did she come here for?"</p>
  <p>Thoughts are quick; imagination is quicker; and Joyce was
          giving the reins to both. Her mistress's gloomy and
          ambiguous words were crowding on her brain. Three
          o'clock! and she had not been in bed, and was not to
          be found in the house! A nameless horror struggled
          to Joyce's face, her eyes were dilating with it: she
          seized and threw on a large flannel gown which lay
          on a chair by the bed, and forgetful of her ailing
          foot, forgetful of her master who stood there, out
            <pb n="100"/> she sprang to the floor. All minor
          considerations faded to insignificance beside the
          terrible dread which had taken possession of her.
          Clasping the flannel gown tight round her with one
          hand, she laid the other on the arm of Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Oh master! oh master! she has destroyed herself! I see
          it all now."</p>
  <p>"Joyce!" sternly interrupted Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"She has destroyed herself, master, as true as that we
          two are living here!" persisted Joyce, her own face
          livid with emotion. "I can understand her words now;
          I could not before. She came here—and her face was
          like a corpse as the light fell upon it—saying she
          had come to get a promise from me to stay with her
          children when she was gone. I asked whether she was
          ill, and she answered, 'Yes, ill and wretched.' Oh,
          sir, may Heaven support you under this dreadful
          trial!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt bewildered; perplexed. Not a syllable
          did he believe. He was not angry with Joyce, for he
          thought she had lost her reason.</p>
  <p>"It is so, sir, incredible as you may deem my words,"
          pursued Joyce, wringing her hands. "My lady has been
          miserably unhappy; and that has driven her to
          it."</p>
  <p>"Joyce, are you in your senses or out of them?" demanded
          Mr. Carlyle, a certain sternness in his tone. "Your
          lady miserably unhappy! what do you mean by such an
          assertion?"</p>
  <p>Before Joyce could answer, an addition was received to
          the company in the person of Miss Carlyle, who
          appeared in black stockings and a shawl, and the
          lofty nightcap. Hearing voices in Joyce's room,
          which <pb n="101"/> was above her own, and full of
          curiosity, she ascended, not choosing to be shut out
          from the conference.</p>
  <p>"Whatever's up?" cried she. "Is Lady Isabel found?"</p>
  <p>"She is not found, and she never will be found but in her
          winding-sheet," returned Joyce, whose lamentable and
          unusual state of excitement completely overpowered
          her customary quiet respect and plain good sense.
          "And, ma'am, I am glad that you have come up; for
          what I was about to say to my master I would prefer
          to say in your presence. When my lady is brought
          into this house, and laid down before us, dead, what
          will your feelings be? My master has done his duty
          by her in love; but you—you have made her life a
          misery. Yes, ma'am, you have."</p>
  <p>"Highty tighty!" uttered Miss Carlyle, staring at Joyce
          in consternation. "What is all this? Where's my
          lady?"</p>
  <p>"She has gone and taken the life that was not hers to
          take," sobbed Joyce, "and I say she has been driven
          to it. She has not been allowed to indulge a will of
          her own, poor thing, since she came to East Lynne:
          in her own house she has been less free than any one
          of her servants. You have curbed her, ma'am, and
          snapped at her, and made her feel that she was but a
          slave to your caprices and temper. All these years
          she has been crossed and put upon; everything, in
          short, but beaten —ma'am, you know she has!—and she
          has borne it all in silence, like a patient angel,
          never, as I believe, complaining to master: he can
          say whether she has or not. We all loved her, we all
          felt for her; and my master's heart would have bled,
          had he suspected what she had to put up with day
          after day, and year after year."</p>
  <pb n="102"/>
  <p>Miss Carlyle's tongue was glued to her mouth. Her
          brother, confounded at the rapid words, could
          scarcely gather in their sense.</p>
  <p>"What is it that you are saying, Joyce?" he asked, in a
          low tone. "I do not understand."</p>
  <p>"I have longed to say it to you many a hundred times,
          sir: but it is right that you should hear it, now
          things have come to this dreadful ending. Since the
          very night Lady Isabel came home here, your wife,
          she has been taunted with the cost she has brought
          to East Lynne and to you. If she wanted but the
          simplest thing, she was forbidden to have it, and
          told that she was bringing her husband to poverty.
          For this very dinner party that she went to
          to-night, she wished for a new dress, and your cruel
          words, ma'am, forbade her having it. She ordered a
          new frock for Miss Isabel, and you countermanded it.
          You have told her that master worked like a dog to
          support her extravagances: when you know that she
          never was extravagant: that none were less inclined
          to go beyond proper limits than she. I have seen
          her, ma'am, come away from your reproaches with the
          tears in her eyes, and her hands meekly clasped upon
          her bosom, as though life was heavy to bear. A
          gentle-spirited, high-born lady, as she was, could
          not fail to be driven to desperation; and I know
          that she has been."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle turned to his sister. "Can this be true?" he
          inquired, in a tone of deep agitation.</p>
  <p>She did not answer. Whether it was the shade cast by the
          nightcap or the reflection of the wax taper, her
          face looked of a green cast: and for the first time
          probably in Miss Carlyle's life, her words
          failed.</p>
  <pb n="103"/>
  <p>"May God forgive you, Cornelia!" he murmured, as he went
          out of the chamber.</p>
  <p>He descended to his own. That his wife had laid violent
          hands upon herself, his reason utterly repudiated:
          she was one of the least likely to commit so great a
          sin. He believed that, in her unhappiness, she might
          have wandered out in the grounds, and was lingering
          there. By this time the house was aroused, and the
          servants were astir. Joyce—surely a supernatural
          strength was given her, for though she had been able
          to put her foot to the ground, she had not yet
          walked upon it— crept down stairs, and went into
          Lady Isabel's dressing-room. Mr. Carlyle was hastily
          assuming the articles of attire he had not yet put
          on, to go out and search the grounds, when Joyce
          limped in, holding out a note. Joyce did not stand
          on ceremony that night.</p>
  <p>"I found this in the dressing-glass drawer, sir. It is my
          lady's writing."</p>
  <p>He took it in his hand and looked at the address.
          "Archibald Carlyle." Though a calm man, one who had
          his emotions under his own control, he was no stoic,
          and his fingers shook as he broke the seal.</p>
  <p>"When years go on, and my children ask where their mother
          is, and why she left them, tell them that you, their
          father, goaded her to it. If they inquire
            <hi>what</hi> she is, tell them also, if you so
          will; but tell them at the same time that you
          outraged and betrayed her, driving her to the very
          depth of desperation, ere she quitted them in her
          despair."</p>
  <p>The hand-writing, his wife's, swam before the eyes of Mr.
          Carlyle. All, save the disgraceful fact that she <pb n="104"/> had <hi>flown</hi> —and a horrible
          suspicion began to dawn upon him with whom—was
          totally incomprehensible. How had he outraged her?
          in what manner had he goaded her to it? The
          discomforts alluded to by Joyce, as the work of his
          sister, had evidently no part in this; yet, what had
            <hi>he</hi> done? He read the letter again, more
          slowly. No, he could not comprehend it: he had not
          the clue.</p>
  <p>At that moment the voices of the servants in the corridor
          outside penetrated to his ears: of course they were
          peering about, and making their own comments,
          Wilson, with her long tongue, the busiest. They were
          saying that Captain Levison was not in his room;
          that his bed had not been slept in.</p>
  <p>Joyce sat on the edge of a chair—she could not stand
          —watching her master with a blanched face: never had
          she seen him betray agitation so powerful. Not the
          faintest suspicion of the dreadful truth had yet
          dawned upon her. He walked to the door, the open
          note in his hand, then turned, wavered, and stood
          still—as if he did not know what he was doing.
          Probably he did not. Then he took out his
          pocket-book, put the note inside it, and returned it
          to his pocket, his hands trembling equally with his
          livid lips.</p>
  <p>"You need not mention this," he said to Joyce, indicating
          the note. "It concerns myself alone."</p>
  <p>"Sir, does it say she's dead?"</p>
  <p>"She is not dead?" he answered. "Worse than that," he
          added in his heart.</p>
  <p>"Why—who is this?" uttered Joyce.</p>
  <p>It was little Isabel, stealing in with a frightened face,
          in her white nightgown. The commotion had aroused
          her.</p>
  <pb n="105"/>
  <p>"What is the matter?" she asked. "Where's mamma?"</p>
  <p>"Child, you'll catch your death of cold," said Joyce. "Go
          back to bed."</p>
  <p>"But I want mamma."</p>
  <p>"In the morning, dear," evasively returned Joyce. "Sir,
          please, must not Miss Isabel go back to bed?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle made no reply to the question; most likely he
          never heard its import. But he touched Isabel's
          shoulder to draw Joyce's attention to the child.</p>
  <p>"Joyce— <hi>Miss Lucy</hi> , in future."</p>
  <p>He left the room, and Joyce remained silent from
          amazement. She heard him go out at the hall door and
          bang it after him. Isabel—nay, we must say "Lucy"
          also—went and stood outside the chamber door: the
          servants, gathered in a group near, did not observe
          her. Presently she came running back, and disturbed
          Joyce from her reverie.</p>
  <p>"Joyce, is it true?"</p>
  <p>"Is what true, my dear?"</p>
  <p>"They are saying that Captain Levison has taken away
          mamma."</p>
  <p>Joyce fell back in her chair, with a scream. It changed
          to a long, low moan of anguish.</p>
  <p>"What has he taken her for?—to kill her? I thought it was
          only kidnappers who took people."</p>
  <p>"Child, child, go to bed!"</p>
  <p>"Oh, Joyce, I want mamma! When will she come back?"</p>
  <p>Joyce hid her face in her hands to conceal its emotion
          from the motherless child. And just then Miss
          Carlyle entered on tiptoe and humbly sat down on a
          low chair, <pb n="106"/> her green face—green that
          night—in its grief, its remorse, and its horror,
          looking nearly as dark as her stockings.</p>
  <p>She broke out into a subdued wail.</p>
  <p>"God be merciful to this dishonoured house!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Justice Hare turned into his gate between twelve and
          one; turned in with a jaunty air: for the justice
          was in spirits, he having won nine sixpences, and
          his friend's tap of ale having been unusually good.
          When he reached his bedroom, he told Mrs. Hare of a
          chaise and four which had gone tearing past at a
          furious pace as he was closing the gate, coming from
          the direction of East Lynne. He wondered where it
          could be going at that midnight hour, and whom it
          contained.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER X. CHARMING RESULTS.</head>
  <p><hi>Nearly</hi> a year went by.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel Carlyle had spent it on the Continent— that
          refuge for such fugitives—now removing about from
          place to place with her companion, now stationary
          and alone. Half the time—taking one absence with
          another—he had been away from her, chiefly in Paris,
          pursuing his own course and his own pleasure.</p>
  <p>How fared it with Lady Isabel? Just as it must be
          expected to fare, and does fare, when a
          high-principled gentlewoman falls from her pedestal.
          Never had she experienced a moment's calm, or peace,
          or happiness, since the fatal night of quitting her
          home. She had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild
          passion; when, instead of the garden of roses it had
          been her persuader's pleasure to promise her, (but
          which, in truth, she had barely glanced at, for that
          had not been her moving motive), she had found
          herself plunged into an abyss of horror, from which
          there was never more any escape; never more, never
          more. The very hour of her departure she awoke to
          what she had done: the guilt, whose aspect had been
          shunned in the prospective, assumed at once its
          true, frightful colour, the blackness of darkness;
          and a lively remorse, a never dying anguish, took
          possession of her soul for ever. Oh, reader, believe
          me! Lady—wife—mother! should you ever be tempted to
          abandon your home, so <pb n="108"/> will you awake.
          Whatever trials may be the lot of your married life,
          though they may magnify themselves to your crushed
          spirit as beyond the endurance of woman to bear,
            <hi>resolve</hi> to bear them; fall down upon your
          knees and pray to be enabled to bear them: pray for
          patience; pray for strength to resist the demon that
          would urge you so to escape; bear unto death, rather
          than forfeit your fair name and your good
          conscience; for be assured that the alternative, if
          you rush on to it, will be found far worse than
          death.</p>
  <p>Poor thing! poor Lady Isabel! She had sacrificed husband,
          children, reputation, home, all that makes life of
          value to woman; she had forfeited her duty to God,
          had deliberately broken His commandments, for the
          one poor miserable sake of flying with Francis
          Levison. But, the instant the step was irrevocable,
          the instant she had left the barrier behind,
          repentance set in. Even in the first days of her
          departure, in the fleeting moments of abandonment,
          when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget
          conscience, it was sharply wounding her with its
          adder stings: and she knew that her whole future
          existence, whether spent with that man or without
          him, would be one dark course of gnawing
          retribution.</p>
  <p>It is possible remorse does not come to all erring wives
          so immediately as it came to Lady Isabel Carlyle
          —you need not be reminded that we speak of women in
          the better positions of life. Lady Isabel was
          endowed with sensitively refined delicacy, with an
          innate, lively consciousness of right and wrong: a
          nature, such as hers, is one of the last that may be
          expected to err; and, but for that most fatal
          misapprehension regarding her husband, the jealous
          belief, fanned by Captain <pb n="109"/> Levison,
          that his love was given to Barbara Hare, and that
          the two were uniting to deceive her, she would never
          have forgotten herself. The haunting skeleton of
          remorse had taken up his lodging within her; a
          skeleton of living fire, that must prey upon her
          heartstrings for ever. Every taunt to be cast upon
          her by the world, every slight that would henceforth
          be her portion, for she had earned it, must tell but
          too surely upon her crushed spirit.</p>
  <p>Nearly a year went by; save some six or eight weeks;
          when, one morning in July, Lady Isabel made her
          appearance in the breakfast-room. They were staying
          now at Grenoble. Taking that town on their way from
          Switzerland, through Savoy, it had been Captain
          Levison's pleasure to halt in it. He engaged
          apartments, furnished, in the vicinity of the Place
          Grenette; it was a windy old house, full of doors
          and windows, chimneys and cupboards; and he said he
          should remain there. Lady Isabel remonstrated; she
          wished to go farther on, where they might get
          quicker news from England; but her will now was as
          nothing. She was looking like the ghost of her
          former self—talk of her having looked ill when she
          took that voyage over the water with Mr. Carlyle,
          you should have seen her now: misery marks the
          countenance worse than sickness. Her face was white
          and worn, her hands were thin, her eyes were sunken
          and surrounded by a black circle: care was digging
          caves for them. A stranger might have attributed
          these signs to her state of health: <hi>she</hi>
          knew better; knew that they were the effects of her
          wretched mind and heart.</p>
  <p>It was very late for breakfast: but why should she rise
          early, only to drag through another endless day? <pb n="110"/> Languidly she took her seat at the
          table, just as Captain Levison's servant, a
          Frenchman, whom he had engaged in Paris, entered the
          room with two letters.</p>
  <p>"Point de gazette, Pierre?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Non, miladi."</p>
  <p>And all the while the sly fox had got the <hi>Times</hi>
          in his coat pocket! But he was only obeying the
          orders of his master. It had been Captain Levison's
          recent pleasure that the newspapers should not be
          seen by Lady Isabel until he had overlooked them.
          You will speedily gather his motive.</p>
  <p>Pierre departed towards Captain Levison's room, and Lady
          Isabel took up the letters and examined their
          superscription with interest. It was known to her
          that Mr. Carlyle had not lost a moment in seeking a
          divorce, and the announcement, that it was granted,
          was now daily expected. She was anxious for it;
          anxious that Captain Levison should render her the
          only reparation in his power, before the birth of
          her child: she little knew that there was not the
          least intention on his part to make her
          reparation—any more than he had made it to others
          who had gone before her. She had become painfully
          aware of the fact that the man, for whom she had
          sacrificed herself, was bad; but she had not learned
          all his badness yet.</p>
  <p>Captain Levison, unwashed, unshaven, with a dressing-gown
          loosely flung on, lounged in to breakfast: the
          decked-out dandies before the world are frequently
          the greatest slovens in domestic privacy. He wished
          her good morning in a careless tone of apathy, and
          she as apathetically answered to it.</p>
  <p>"Pierre says there are some letters," he began. "What a
          precious hot day it is!"</p>
  <pb n="111"/>
  <p>"Two," was her short reply, her tone sullen as his. For,
          if you think, my good reader, that the flattering
          words, the ardent expressions which usually attend
          the beginning of these promising unions, last out a
          whole ten months, you are in egregious error.
          Compliments, the very opposite to honey and
          sweetness, have generally supervened long before.
          Try it, if you don't believe me.</p>
  <p>"Two letters," she continued, "and they are both in the
          same hand-writing: your solicitor's, I believe".</p>
  <p>Up went his head at the last word, and he made a snatch
          at the letters; stalked to the farthest window,
          opened one, and glanced over its contents.</p>
  <p>"Sir,—We beg to inform you that the suit, Carlyle
            <hi>v</hi> . Carlyle, is at an end: the divorce
          was pronounced without opposition. According to your
          request, we hasten to forward you the earliest
          intimation of the fact.</p>
  <p>"We are, sir, faithfully yours,</p>
  <p>" <hi>Moss &amp; Grab.</hi></p>
  <p>"F. Levison, Esq."</p>
  <p>It was over, then. And all claim to the name of Carlyle
          was declared to have been forfeited by the Lady
          Isabel for ever. Captain Levison folded up the
          letter, and placed it securely in an inner
          pocket.</p>
  <p>"Is there any news?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"News!"</p>
  <p>"Of the divorce, I mean."</p>
  <p>"Tush!" was the response of Captain Levison, as if
          wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a far-off
          affair: and he proceeded to open the other
          letter.</p>
  <p>"Sir,—After sending off our last, dated to-day, we <pb n="112"/> received tidings of the demise of Sir
          Peter Levison, your great-uncle. He expired this
          afternoon in town, where he had come for the benefit
          of medical advice. We have much pleasure in
          congratulating you upon your accession to the title
          and estates: and beg to state that should it not be
          convenient to you to visit England at present, we
          will be happy to transact all necessary matters for
          you, on your favouring us with instructions.</p>
  <p>"And we remain, sir, most faithfully yours,</p>
  <p>" <hi>Moss &amp; Grab.</hi></p>
  <p>"Sir Francis Levison, Bart."</p>
  <p>The outside of this letter was superscribed as the other,
          "F. Levison, Esquire;" no doubt with a view to its
          more certain delivery.</p>
  <p>"At last! thank the pigs!" was the gentleman's euphonious
          expression, as he tossed the letter open upon the
          breakfast table.</p>
  <p>"The divorce is granted!" feverishly uttered Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>He made no reply, but seated himself to breakfast.</p>
  <p>"May I read the letter? Is it for me to read?"</p>
  <p>"For what else should I have thrown it there?" he
          said.</p>
  <p>"A few days ago, you put a letter, open, on the table, I
          thought for me: but when I took it up you swore at
          me. Do you remember it, Captain Levison?"</p>
  <p>"You may drop that odious title, Isabel, which has stuck
          to me all too long. I own a better now."</p>
  <p>"What is it, pray?"</p>
  <p>"You can look, and see."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel took up the letter and read it. Sir Francis
          swallowed his coffee, and rang the table hand-bell
            <pb n="113"/> —the only bell you generally meet
          with in France. Pierre answered it.</p>
  <p>"Put me up a change of things," said he, in French. "I
          start for England in an hour."</p>
  <p>"It was very well," Pierre responded: and departed to do
          it. Lady Isabel waited till the man was gone, and
          then spoke, a faint flush of emotion appearing in
          her cheeks.</p>
  <p>"You do not mean what you say? You will not leave me
          yet?"</p>
  <p>"I cannot do otherwise," he answered. "There's a mountain
          of business to be attended to, now that I am come
          into power."</p>
  <p>"Moss and Grab say they will act for you. Had there been
          a necessity for your going, they would not have
          offered that."</p>
  <p>"Ay, they say so—with a nice eye to the feathering of
          their pockets! Go to England I must: it is
          absolutely essential. Besides, I should not choose
          the old man's funeral to take place without me."</p>
  <p>"Then I must accompany you," she urged.</p>
  <p>"I wish you would not talk nonsense, Isabel. Are you in a
          state to travel night and day? Neither would England
          be agreeable to you at present."</p>
  <p>She felt the force of the objections: resuming, after a
          moment's pause. "Were you to go to England, you
          might not be back in time."</p>
  <p>"In time for what?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, how can you ask?" she rejoined, in a sharp tone of
          reproach; "you know too well. In time to make me
          your wife when the divorce shall appear."</p>
  <p>"I must chance it," coolly observed Sir Francis.</p>
  <p>"Chance it! <hi>chance</hi> the legitimacy of the child?
            <pb n="114"/> You must assure that, before all
          things. More terrible to me than all the rest would
          it be, if—"</p>
  <p>"Now don't put yourself in a fever, Isabel. How many
          times am I to be compelled to beg that of you? It
          does no good. Is it my fault, if I am called
          suddenly to England?"</p>
  <p>"Have you no pity for your child?" she urged, in
          agitation. "Nothing can repair the injury, if you
          once suffer it to come upon him. He will be a
          by-word amidst men throughout his life."</p>
  <p>"You had better have written to the law lords to urge on
          the divorce," he retorted. "I cannot help the
          delay."</p>
  <p>"There has been no delay: quite the contrary. But it may
          be expected hourly now."</p>
  <p>"You are worrying yourself for nothing, Isabel. I shall
          be back in time."</p>
  <p>He quitted the room as he spoke, and Lady Isabel remained
          in it, the image of despair. Nearly an hour passed,
          when she remembered the breakfast-things, and rang
          for them to be removed. A maid-servant entered to do
          it, and she thought how will miladi looked.</p>
  <p>"Where was Pierre?" miladi asked.</p>
  <p>"Pierre was making himself ready to attend monsieur to
          England."</p>
  <p>Scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and her
          tray when Sir Francis Levison appeared, equipped for
          travelling. "Good bye, Isabel," said he, without
          further circumlocution or ceremony.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel, excited beyond all self-control, slipped the
          bolt of the door; and, half leaning against it, half
          kneeling at his feet, held up her hands in
          supplication.</p>
  <pb n="115"/>
  <p>"Francis, have you any consideration left for me— any in
          the world?"</p>
  <p>"How can you be so absurd, Isabel? Of course I have," he
          continued, in a peevish though kind tone, as he took
          hold of her hands to raise her.</p>
  <p>"No, not yet. I will remain here until you say you will
          wait another day or two. You know that the French
          Protestant minister is prepared to marry us, the
          instant news of the divorce shall arrive: if you do
          care still for me, you will wait."</p>
  <p>"I cannot wait," he replied, his tone changing to one of
          determination. "It is useless to urge it."</p>
  <p>"Say that you will not."</p>
  <p>"Well, then, I will not; if you would prefer to have it:
          anything to please you. Isabel, you are like a
          child. I shall be back in time."</p>
  <p>"Do not think I am urging it for my sake," she panted,
          growing more agitated with every fleeting moment.
          "You know that I am not. I do not care what becomes
          of me. No; you shall not go till you hear me! Oh,
          Francis, by all I have forfeited for your sake—"</p>
  <p>"Get up, Isabel," he interrupted.</p>
  <p>"For the child's sake! for the child's sake. A whole long
          life before it; never to hold up its head, of right;
          the reproach everlastingly upon it that it was born
          in sin! Francis! Francis! if you have no pity for
          me, have pity upon it!"</p>
  <p>"I think you are losing your senses, Isabel. There's a
          month yet, and I promise you to be back ere it shall
          have elapsed. Nay, ere half of it shall have
          elapsed: a week will accomplish all I want to do in
          London. Let me pass: you have my promise, and I will
          keep it."</p>
  <pb n="116"/>
  <p>She never moved. Only stood where she was, raising her
          supplicating hands. He grew impatient, and by some
          dexterous sleight of hand got the door open. She
          seized his arm.</p>
  <p>"Not for my sake," she panted still, her dry lips drawn
          and livid.</p>
  <p>"Nonsense about 'not for your sake.' It is for your sake
          that I will keep my promise. I <hi>must</hi> go.
          There: good bye, Isabel, and take care of
          yourself."</p>
  <p>He broke from her and left the room, and in another
          minute had left the house, Pierre attending him. A
          feeling, amounting to a conviction, rushed over the
          unhappy lady, that she had seen him for the last
          time until it should be too late.</p>
  <p>She was right. It was too late, by weeks and months.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XI. MUTUAL COMPLIMENTS.</head>
  <p><hi>December</hi> came in. The Alps were covered with
          snow; Grenoble borrowed the shade, and looked cold,
          and white, and sleety, and sloppy; the wide gutters
          which run through the middle of certain of the
          streets, were unusually black, and the people crept
          along, looking very dismal. Close to the fire, in
          the barn of a French bed-room, full of windows, and
          doors, and draughts, with its wide hearth, and its
          wide chimney, into which we could put four of five
          of our English ones, shivered Lady Isabel Vane. She
          wore an invalid cap, and a thick woollen invalid
          shawl, and she shook and shivered perpetually;
          though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that
          there was a danger of her petticoats igniting, and
          the attendant had frequently to spring up and
          interpose between them and the crackling logs.
          Little did it seem to matter to Lady Isabel: she sat
          in one position, her countenance the picture of
          stony despair.</p>
  <p>So had she sat, so looked, since she began to get better.
          She had had a long illness, terminating in low
          fever; but the attendants whispered amongst
          themselves that miladi would soon get about if she
          would only rouse herself. She had so far got about
          as to sit up <pb n="118"/> in the windy chamber; and
          it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect
          indifference whether she ever got out of it.</p>
  <p>This day she had partaken of her early dinner—such as it
          was, for appetite failed—and had dozed asleep in the
          arm-chair, when a noise arose from below, like a
          carriage driving into the court-yard through the
          porte cochère. It instantly aroused her. Had
            <hi>he</hi> come?</p>
  <p>"Who is it?" she asked of the nurse.</p>
  <p>"Miladi, it is monsieur: and Pierre is with him. I have
          begged miladi often and often not to fret, for that
          monsieur would surely come: and miladi sees I am
          right."</p>
  <p>A strangely firm expression, speaking of severe
          resolution, overspread the face of Lady Isabel. It
          would appear to say that she had not "fretted" much
          after him who had now arrived: or, at any rate, that
          she was not fretting after him now. "Patience and
          calmness!" she murmured to herself. "Oh, may they
          not desert me, now the time has come!"</p>
  <p>"Monsieur looks so well!" proclaimed the maid, who had
          taken up her station at a window that overlooked the
          court-yard. "He has got out of the carriage: he is
          shaking himself and stamping his feet."</p>
  <p>"You may leave the room, Susanne," said Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"But if the baby wakes, miladi?"</p>
  <p>"I will ring."</p>
  <p>The girl departed, closing the door, and Lady Isabel sat
          looking at it, schooling herself into patience.
          Another moment, and it was flung open.</p>
  <p>Sir Francis Levison approached to greet her as he came
          in. She waved him off, begging him, in a subdued,
            <pb n="119"/> quiet tone, not to draw too near, as
          any little excitement made her faint now. He took a
          seat opposite to her, and began pushing the logs
          together with his boot, as he explained that he
          really could not get away from town before.</p>
  <p>"Why did you come now?" she quietly rejoined.</p>
  <p>"Why did I come?" repeated he. "Are these all the thanks
          a fellow gets for travelling in this inclement
          weather? I thought you would at least have been glad
          to welcome me, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Sir Francis," she rejoined, speaking still with almost
          unnatural calmness, as she continued to do
          throughout the interview—though the frequent changes
          in her countenance, and the movement of her hands,
          when she laid them from time to time on her chest to
          keep down its beating, told what an effort the
          struggle cost her—"Sir Francis, I am glad, for one
          reason, to welcome you: we must come to an
          understanding, one with the other; and, so far, I am
          pleased that you are here. It was my intention to
          have communicated with you by letter as soon as I
          found myself capable of the necessary exertion, but
          your visit has removed the necessity. I wish to deal
          with you quite unreservedly, without concealment or
          deceit: I must request you so to deal with me."</p>
  <p>"What do you mean by 'deal?'" he asked, settling the logs
          to his apparent satisfaction.</p>
  <p>"To speak and act. Let there be plain truth between us at
          this interview, if there never has been before."</p>
  <p>"I don't understand you."</p>
  <p>"Naked truth, unglossed over," she pursued, bending her
          eyes determinately upon him. "It <hi>must</hi>
          be."</p>
  <pb n="120"/>
  <p>"With all my heart," returned Sir Francis. "It is you who
          have thrown out the challenge, mind."</p>
  <p>"When you left in July you gave me a sacred promise to
          come back in time for our marriage: you know what I
          mean when I say 'in time:' but—"</p>
  <p>"Of course I meant to do so when I gave the promise," he
          interrupted. "But no sooner had I set foot in London
          than I found myself overwhelmed with business, and
          away from it I could not get. Even now I can only
          remain with you a couple of days, for I must hasten
          back to town."</p>
  <p>"You are breaking faith already," she said, after hearing
          him calmly to the end. "Your words are not words of
          truth, but of deceit. You did not intend to be back
          in time for the marriage; or, otherwise, you would
          have caused it to take place ere you went at
          all."</p>
  <p>"What fancies you take up!" uttered Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>"Some time subsequent to your departure," she quietly
          went on, "one of the maids was setting to rights the
          clothes in your dressing-closet, and she brought me
          a letter she found in one of the pockets. I saw, by
          the date, that it was one of those two which you
          received on the morning of your departure. It
          contained the information that the divorce was
          pronounced."</p>
  <p>She spoke so quietly, so apparently without feeling or
          passion, that Sir Francis was agreeably astonished.
          He should have less trouble in throwing off the
          mask. But he was an ill-tempered man; and, to hear
          that the letter had been found, to have the
          falseness of his fine protestations and promises so
          effectually laid bare, did <pb n="121"/> not improve
          his temper now. Lady Isabel continued:</p>
  <p>"It had been better to have undeceived me then; to have
          told me that the hopes I was cherishing, for the
          sake of the unborn child, were worse than vain."</p>
  <p>"I did not judge so," he replied. "The excited state you
          then appeared to be in, would have precluded your
          listening to any sort of reason."</p>
  <p>Her heart beat a little quicker: but she stilled it. "You
          deem that it was not in reason I should aspire to be
          made the wife of Sir Francis Levison?"</p>
  <p>He rose and began kicking at the logs; with the heel of
          his boot this time. "Well, Isabel—you must be aware
          that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my
          position to marry a divorced woman."</p>
  <p>The hectic flushed into her thin cheeks, but her voice
          sounded calm as before.</p>
  <p>"When I expected, or wished, for the 'sacrifice,' it was
          not for my own sake: I told you so then. But it was
          not made: and the child's inheritance is that of sin
          and shame. There he lies."</p>
  <p>Sir Francis half turned to where she pointed, and saw an
          infant's cradle by the side of the bed. He did not
          take the trouble to go to look at it.</p>
  <p>"I am the representative now of an ancient and respected
          baronetcy," he resumed, in a tone as of apology for
          his previously heartless words, "and, to make you my
          wife would so offend all my family, that—"</p>
  <p>"Stay," interrupted Lady Isabel; "you need not trouble
          yourself to find needless excuses. Had you taken
          this journey for the purpose of making me your <pb n="122"/> wife, were you to propose to do so this
          day, and bring a clergyman into the room to perform
          the ceremony, it would be futile. The injury to the
          child can never be repaired: and, for myself, I
          cannot imagine any fate in life worse, than the
          being compelled to pass it with you."</p>
  <p>"If you have taken this aversion to me, it cannot be
          helped," he coolly said; inwardly congratulating
          himself at being spared the trouble he had
          anticipated. "You made commotion enough once, about
          my making you 'reparation.'"</p>
  <p>She shook her head. "All the reparation in your power to
          make, all the reparation that the whole world can
          invent, could not undo my sin. It, and its effects,
          must lie upon me for ever."</p>
  <p>"Oh—sin!" was the derisive exclamation. "You ladies
          should think of that beforehand."</p>
  <p>"Yes," she sadly answered. "May Heaven help all to do so,
          who may be tempted as I was."</p>
  <p>"If you mean that, as a reproach to me, it's rather out
          of place," chafed Sir Francis, whose fits of ill
          temper were under no control, and who never, when in
          them, cared what he said to outrage the feelings of
          another. "The temptation to sin, as you call it, lay
          not in my persuasions, half so much as in your
          jealous anger towards your husband."</p>
  <p>"Quite true," was her reply.</p>
  <p>"And I believe you were on the wrong scent, Isabel —if it
          will be any satisfaction to you to hear it. Since we
          are mutually on this complimentary discourse, it is
          of no consequence to smooth over facts."</p>
  <p>"I do not understand what you would imply," she <pb n="123"/> said, drawing her shawl round her with a
          fresh shiver. "How 'on the wrong scent?'"</p>
  <p>"With regard to your husband and that Hare girl. You were
          blindly, outrageously jealous of him."</p>
  <p>"Go on."</p>
  <p>"And I say I think you were on the wrong scent. I do not
          believe Carlyle ever thought of the girl—in that
          way."</p>
  <p>"What do you mean?" she gasped.</p>
  <p>"They had a secret between them. Not of love. A secret of
          business: and those interviews they had together,
          her dancing attendance upon him perpetually, related
          to that; and to that alone."</p>
  <p>Her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the
          interview. He spoke quietly now, quite in an equable
          tone of reasoning: it was his way when his ill
          temper was upon him; and the calmer he spoke, the
          more cutting were his words. He <hi>need</hi> not
          have told her this.</p>
  <p>"What was the secret?" she inquired, in a low tone.</p>
  <p>"Nay, I can't explain all; they did not take me into
          their confidence. They did not even take you:
          better, perhaps, that they had, though, as things
          have turned out—or seem to be turning. There's some
          disreputable secret attaching to the Hare family,
          and Carlyle was acting in it for Mrs. Hare. She
          could not seek out Carlyle herself, so she sent the
          young lady. That's all I knew."</p>
  <p>"How did you know it?"</p>
  <p>"I had reason to think so."</p>
  <p>"What reason? I must request you to tell me."</p>
  <p>"I overheard scraps of their conversation now and <pb n="124"/> then in those meetings, and so gathered
          my conclusions."</p>
  <p>"You told a different tale to me, Sir Francis," was her
          remark, as she lifted her indignant eyes towards
          him.</p>
  <p>Sir Francis laughed. "All stratagems are fair in love and
          war."</p>
  <p>She dared not immediately trust herself to reply, and a
          silence ensued. Sir Francis broke it, pointing with
          his left thumb over his shoulder in the direction of
          the cradle.</p>
  <p>"What have you named that young article there?"</p>
  <p>"The name which ought to have been his by inheritance:
          'Francis Levison,'" was her icy answer.</p>
  <p>"Let's see—how old is he now?"</p>
  <p>"He was born the last day of August."</p>
  <p>Sir Francis threw up his arms and stretched himself, as
          if a fit of idleness had overtaken him; then
          advanced to the cradle and pulled down the
          clothes.</p>
  <p>"Who is he like, Isabel? My handsome self?"</p>
  <p>"Were he like you—in spirit—I would pray that he might
          die, ere he could speak or think," she burst forth.
          And then, remembering the resolution she had marked
          out for herself, subsided outwardly into calmness
          again.</p>
  <p>"What else?" retorted Sir Francis. "You know my
          disposition pretty well by this time, Isabel, and
          may be sure that if you deal out small change to me,
          you will get it back again with interest."</p>
  <p>She made no reply. Sir Francis put the clothes back over
          the sleeping child, returned to the fire and stood a
          few moments with his back to it.</p>
  <pb n="125"/>
  <p>"Is my room prepared for me, do you know?" he presently
          asked.</p>
  <p>"No, it is not," she quietly rejoined. "These apartments
          are mine now: they have been transferred into my
          name, and they can never again afford you
          accommodation. Will you be so obliging—I am not
          strong—as to hand me that writing-case?"</p>
  <p>Sir Francis walked to the table she indicated, which was
          at the far end of the great barn of a room; and,
          taking the writing-case from it, gave it to her.</p>
  <p>She reached her keys from the stand at her elbow,
          unlocked the case, and took from it some
          bank-notes.</p>
  <p>"I received these from you a month ago," she said. "They
          came by post."</p>
  <p>"And you never had the grace to acknowledge them," he
          returned, in a sort of mock-reproachful tone.</p>
  <p>"Forty pounds. That was the amount, was it not?"</p>
  <p>"I believe so."</p>
  <p>"Allow me to return them to you. Count them."</p>
  <p>"Return them to me, why?" inquired Sir Francis, in
          amazement.</p>
  <p>"I have no longer anything whatever to do with you, in
          any way. Do not make my arm ache, holding out the
          notes to you so long! Take them."</p>
  <p>Sir Francis took the notes from her hand and placed them
          on the stand near to her.</p>
  <p>"If it be your wish that all relations should end between
          us, why, let it be so," he said. "I must confess I
          think it may be the wisest course, as things have
          come to this pass, for the cat-and-dog life, which
          would seemingly be ours, is not agreeable. Remember,
          that it is <pb n="126"/> your doing; not mine. But
          you cannot think I am going to see you starve,
          Isabel. A sum—we will fix upon its amount
          amicably—shall be placed to your credit half yearly,
          and—"</p>
  <p>"I beg of you to cease!" she passionately interrupted.
          "What do you take me for?"</p>
  <p>"Take you for! Why, how can you live? You have no
          fortune: you must receive assistance from some
          one."</p>
  <p>"I will not receive it from you. If the whole world
          denied me, and I could find no help from strangers,
          or means of earning my own bread, and it was
          necessary that I should still exist, I would apply
          to my husband for means, rather than to you. This
          ought to convince you that the topic may cease."</p>
  <p>"Your husband?" sarcastically rejoined Sir Francis.
          Generous man!</p>
  <p>A flush, deep and painful, dyed her cheeks. "I should
          have said my late husband. You need not have
          reminded me of the mistake."</p>
  <p>"If you will accept nothing for yourself, you must for
          the child. He, at any rate, falls to my share. I
          shall give you a few hundreds a year with him."</p>
  <p>She beat her hands before her, as if beating off the man
          and his words. "Not a farthing, now or ever: were
          you to attempt to send money for him, I would throw
          it into the nearest river. <hi>Whom</hi> do you take
          me for?— <hi>what</hi> do you take me for?" she
          repeated, rising in her bitter mortification; "if
          you have put me beyond the pale of the world, I am
          still Lord Mount Severn's daughter."</p>
  <p>"You did as much towards putting yourself beyond its
          pale, as—"</p>
  <pb n="127"/>
  <p>"Don't I know it? Have I not said so?" she sharply
          interrupted. And then she sat, striving to calm
          herself, clasping together her shaking hands.</p>
  <p>"Well, if you will persist in this perverse resolution, I
          cannot mend it," resumed Sir Francis. "In a little
          time you may probably wish to recall it: in which
          case, a line, addressed to me at my bankers',
          will—"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel drew herself up. "Put away these notes, if
          you please," she interrupted, not allowing him to
          finish his sentence.</p>
  <p>He took out his pocket-book, and placed the bank-notes
          within it.</p>
  <p>"Your clothes—those you left here when you went to
          England—you will have the goodness to order Pierre
          to take away this afternoon. And now, Sir Francis, I
          believe that is all: we will part."</p>
  <p>"To remain mortal enemies from henceforth?" he rejoined.
          "Is that to be it?"</p>
  <p>"To be strangers," she replied, correcting him. "I wish
          you a good day."</p>
  <p>"So! you will not even shake hands with me, Isabel!"</p>
  <p>"I would prefer not."</p>
  <p>And thus they parted. Sir Francis left the room, but not
          immediately the house. He went into a distant
          apartment, and, calling the servants before
          him—there were but two—gave them each a year's wages
          in advance. "That they might not have to trouble
          miladi for money," he said to them. Then he paid a
          visit to the landlord, and handed him likewise a
          year's rent in advance, making the same remark.
          After that, he ordered dinner at an hotel, and the
          same night he and Pierre departed on their journey
          home again, Sir Francis <pb n="128"/> thanking his
          lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a
          vexatious annoyance.</p>
  <p>And Lady Isabel? She passed her evening alone, sitting in
          the same place, close to the fire and the sparks.
          The attendant remonstrated that miladi was remaining
          up too late for her strength; but miladi ordered her
          and her remonstrance into an adjoining room.</p>
  <p>Never had her remorseful repentance been more keenly
          vivid to her than it was that evening; never had her
          position, present and future, loomed out in blacker
          colours. The facts of her hideous case stood before
          her, naked and bare. She had wilfully abandoned her
          husband, her children, her home; she had cast away
          her good name and her position; and she had
          deliberately offended God. What had she gained in
          return? What was she? A poor outcast; one of those
          whom men pity, and whom women shrink from; a
          miserable, friendless creature, who had henceforth
          to earn the bread she, and the other life dependent
          on her, must eat, the clothes they must wear, the
          roof that must cover them, the fuel they must burn.
          She had a few valuable jewels, her mother's or her
          father's gifts, which she had brought away from East
          Lynne: she had brought no others, nothing given to
          her by Mr. Carlyle: and these she now intended to
          dispose of, and live upon until they were gone. The
          proceeds, with strict economy, might last her some
          twelve or eighteen months, she calculated: after
          that, she must find out some means of supply for the
          future. Put the child out to nurse, conceal her
          name, and go out as governess in a French or German
          family, was one of her visions in prospective.</p>
  <p>A confused idea of revenge had been in her mind, urging
          her on to desperation, the night she quitted her <pb n="129"/> home; of revenge on Mr. Carlyle for his
          supposed conduct to her. But what revenge had the
          step really brought to her heart? As her eyes opened
          to her folly and to the true character of Francis
          Levison, so in proportion did they close to the
          fault by which her husband had offended her. She saw
          it in fainter colours; she began to suspect—nay, she
          knew—that her own excited feelings had magnified it
          in length, and breadth, and height—had made a
          molehill into a mountain; and, long before the
          scandal of her act had died away in the mouths of
          men, and Mr. Carlyle had legally put her from him,
          she had repented of the false step for her husband's
          sake, and longed—though it could never be —to be
          back again, his wife. She remembered his noble
          qualities; doubly noble did they appear to her, now
          that her interest in them must cease; she remembered
          how happy they had been together, save for her own
          self-torment touching Barbara Hare; and, worse than
          all, her esteem, her admiration, her affection for
          him, had returned to her fourfold. We never know the
          full value of a thing until we lose it. Health,
          prosperity, happiness, a peaceful conscience; what
          think we of these blessings while they are ours?
          But, when we lose them! why, we look back in
          surprise at our ungrateful apathy. A friend may be
          very dear; but we don't know how dear until he is
          gone: let him go for ever, and the sorrow is almost
          greater than we can bear. <hi>She</hi> had lost Mr.
          Carlyle, and by her own act: she had thrown him from
          her; and now she must make the best of her work,
          spending her whole future life probably in one long
          yearning for him and for her children. The hint,
          thrown out by Sir Francis that afternoon, that her
          suspicions had been mistaken, that her jealousy had
            <pb n="130"/> had no foundation, did not tend to
          mitigate her repentance. Whether he was right or
          wrong in his opinion, she did not know; but she
          dwelt upon it much: it was possible Sir Francis had
          merely said it to provoke her, for she knew his
          temper, and that he would be capable of it: but, if
          right, what an utterly blind fool she had been!</p>
  <p>Her recent and depressing illness, the conviction of Sir
          Francis Levison's complete worthlessness, the
          terrible position in which she found herself, had
          brought to Lady Isabel <hi>reflection</hi> . Not the
          reflection, so called, that may come to us who yet
          live in, and for, the world, but that which must,
          almost of necessity, attend one, whose part in the
          world is over, who has no interest left between this
          and the next. A conviction of her sin ever oppressed
          her: not only of the one act of it, patent to the
          scandal-mongers, but of the long, sinful life she
          had led from childhood; sinful, insomuch as that it
          had been carelessly indifferent. When thoughts of
          the future life, and the necessity of preparing for
          it, had occasionally come over her—there are odd
          moments when they come over even the worst of us—she
          had been content to leave it to an indefinite
          future; possibly to a death-bed repentance. But now
          the truth had begun to dawn upon her, and was
          growing more clear day by day.</p>
  <p>She leaned her aching head this night and dwelt upon
          these thoughts. She stretched out her wasted hand
          for a Book, which she had rarely used to look into,
          save at stated times and periods, and more as a
          forced duty than with any other feeling. Opening it
          at a certain chapter, she read some verses at its
          commencement; she had read them often lately; for
          she had <pb n="131"/> begun to hope that the same
          merciful tidings might be vouchsafed to her troubled
          spirit: "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no
          more."</p>
  <p>There was much to be blotted out; a whole life of apathy
          and errors and sinfulness. Her future days, spent in
          repentance, could they atone for the past? She
          hunted out some other words, though she did not know
          in what part they might be: "If any man will come
          after me, let him take up his cross daily, and
          follow me." What a cross was hers to take up! But
          she must do it; she would do it, by God's
          blessing—ah! had she got so far as to ask
            <hi>that?</hi> She would take it up from
          henceforth daily and hourly, and bear it as she best
          might: she had fully earned all its weight and its
          sharp pain, and must not shrink from her burden.
          That night, for the first time, a momentary vision
          floated before her mind's eye, a far off, far off,
          indistinct vision of the shame and remorse and
          sorrow of her breaking heart, giving place to
          something like peace.</p>
  <p>Susanne was called at last. Susanne was sleepy and cross.
          Miladi surely could not know that the clock of
          Notre-Dame had gone midnight: and—well! if there
          wasn't miladi's arrowroot cold as ice and good for
          nothing! Miladi wanted to go into her grave, that
          was a fact.</p>
  <p>Miladi replied that she only wanted at present to go into
          her bed, if Susanne would undress her. Susanne
          applied herself to the task, indulging in sundry
          scraps of gossip the while: Susanne and her
          fellow-servant having had their curiosity uncommonly
          whetted that day.</p>
  <p>A very miserable affair it must be, that monsieur should
          have had to go back as soon as he came! All <pb n="132"/> those many miles, over those cold
          wretched roads, behind a shrieking and dangerous
          steam-engine, and across that abominable sea! She,
          once upon a time, when she was living with a family
          in Paris, had had leave to go down by one of those
          Sunday pleasure excursions to Dieppe, and she was
          asked to go upon the sea when she got there, and the
          wicked Fates put it into her poor ignorant heart to
          say Yes. Ah, dame! she should never forget it! it
          spoiled still the best supper ever put before her,
          when she thought of it. Let it be fromage de cochon
          and a glass of vin de Bordeaux, or any other choice
          luxuries miladi might please to picture, not a bit
          of appetite had she, if those dreadful three hours
          on the pitching sea rose up in her mind: and she
          could hear yet her own groans, and see the state of
          her lovely green robe when she got back to land; and
          oh! the trimmings in her cap! And monsieur had
          undergone all that, with the travelling besides,
          only to stop an hour and to go again. Pauline said
          he must have had bad news, to call him home, at the
          last post town, and would no doubt soon be here
          again. When would miladi be expecting him?</p>
  <p>Miladi replied by desiring her not to talk so fast, and
          Susanne shrugged her shoulders in an ecstasy of
          disappointment. She had boasted to Pauline that
            <hi>she</hi> should learn all, for certain: though
          Pauline, entombed in the lower regions amidst her
          casseroles and marmites, could not of course expect
          to be enlightened, unless at second hand.</p>
  <p>When Lady Isabel lay down to rest, she sank into somewhat
          calmer sleep than she had known of late; also into a
          dream. She thought she was back at East Lynne—not
            <hi>back</hi> , in one sense, but that she seemed
            <pb n="133"/> never to have gone away from
          it—walking in the flower-garden with Mr. Carlyle,
          while the three children played on the lawn. Her arm
          was within her husband's, and he was relating
          something to her: what the news was, she could not
          remember afterwards, excepting that it was connected
          with the office and old Mr. Dill, and that Mr.
          Carlyle laughed when he told it. They appeared to be
          interrupted by the crying of Archibald: and, in
          turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter, she
          awoke. Alas! it was the actual crying of her own
          child which awoke her; this last child; the
          ill-fated little being in the cradle beside her.
          But, for a single instant, she forgot recent events
          and doings; she believed she was indeed in her happy
          home at East Lynne, a proud mother, an honoured
          wife. As recollection flashed across her with its
          piercing stings, she gave vent to a sharp cry of
          agony, of unavailing despair.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XII. ALONE FOR EVERMORE.</head>
  <p><hi>A surprise</hi> awaited Lady Isabel Vane. It was on a
          windy day in the following March that a traveller
          arrived at Grenoble, and inquired his way, of a
          porter, to the best hotel in the place, his French
          being such that only an Englishman can produce.</p>
  <p>"Hotel? let's see," returned the man, politely, but with
          native indifference, "there are two good hotels
          nearly contiguous to each other, and monsieur would
          find himself comfortable at either. There is the
          Trois Dauphins; and there is the Ambassadeurs."</p>
  <p>"Monsieur" chose, haphazard, the Hôtel des Ambassadeurs,
          and was conducted to it. Shortly after his arrival
          there, he inquired his road to the Place Grenette, a
          guide was offered, but he preferred to go alone. The
          Place was found, and he thence turned to the
          apartments of Lady Isabel Vane.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel was sitting where you saw her the previous
          December, in the precise spot, courting the warmth
          of the fire and—it seemed—courting the sparks also,
          for they appeared as fond of her as formerly: the
          marvel was, how she had escaped combustion. You
          might think but a night had passed when you looked
          at the room; for it wore precisely the same aspect
            <pb n="135"/> now as then; everything was the
          same, even to the child's cradle in the remote
          corner, partially hidden by the bed-curtains, and
          the sleeping child in it. Lady Isabel's progress
          towards recovery had been lingering: as is
          frequently the case when mind and body are both
          diseased. She was sitting when Susanne entered the
          room, and said that a "Monsieur Anglais" had arrived
          in the town to see her, and was waiting below, in
          the salon.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel was startled. An English gentleman— to see
            <hi>her!</hi></p>
  <p>English for certain, was Susanne's answer, for she had
          difficulty to comprehend his French.</p>
  <p>Who could be desirous to see her? one out of the world
          and forgotten! "Susanne," she suddenly cried aloud,
          a thought striking her, "it is never Sir Fran— it is
          not monsieur?"</p>
  <p>Not in the least like monsieur, complacently answered
          Susanne. It was a tall, brave English gentleman,
          proud and noble, looking like a prince.</p>
  <p>Every pulse within Lady Isabel's body throbbed
          rebelliously; her heart bounded till it was like to
          burst her side, and she turned sick with excitement.
          "Tall, brave, noble!" could that description apply
          to any but Mr. Carlyle? Strange that so unnatural an
          idea should have occurred to her: it could not have
          done so in a calmer moment. She rose, tottered
          across the chamber, and prepared to descend.
          Susanne's tongue was let loose at the
          proceeding.</p>
  <p>Was miladi out of her senses? To attempt going down
          stairs would be a pretty ending, for she'd surely
          fall by the way. Miladi knew that the bottom step
          was of lead, and that no head could pitch down upon
            <pb n="136"/> that, without ever being a head any
          more, except in the hospitals. Let miladi sit still
          in her place and she'd bring the monsieur up. What
          did it signify? He was not a young petit maître, he
          was fifty, if he was a day; his hair already turned
          to a fine grey.</p>
  <p>This set the question, touching Mr. Carlyle, at rest, and
          her heart stilled again. The next moment she was
          inwardly laughing in bitter mockery at her insensate
          folly. Mr. Carlyle come to see her! <hi>Her!</hi>
          Francis Levison might be sending over some man of
          business, regarding the money question, was her next
          thought; if so, she should certainly not see
          him.</p>
  <p>"Go down to the gentleman and ask his name, Susanne. Ask
          also from whence he comes."</p>
  <p>Susanne disappeared, and returned, and the gentleman
          behind her. Whether she had invited him, or whether
          he had chosen to come uninvited, there he was. Lady
          Isabel caught a glimpse, and flung her hands over
          her burning cheeks of shame. It was Lord Mount
          Severn.</p>
  <p>"How did you find out where I was?" she gasped, when some
          painful words had been uttered on both sides.</p>
  <p>"I went to Sir Francis Levison and demanded your address.
          Certain recent events implied that he and you must
          have parted, and I therefore deemed it time to
          inquire what he had done with you."</p>
  <p>"Since last July," she interrupted, lifting her wan face,
          now colourless again. "Do not think worse of me than
          I am. He was here in December for an hour's
          recriminating interview, and we then parted for
          life."</p>
  <p>"What have you heard of him lately?"</p>
  <p>"Not anything. I never know what is passing in <pb n="137"/> the world at home; I have no newspaper,
          no correspondence; and he would scarcely be so bold
          as to write to me again."</p>
  <p>"I shall not shock you, then, by some tidings I bring you
          regarding him," returned Lord Mount Severn.</p>
  <p>"The greatest shock to me would be, to hear that I should
          ever again be subjected to see him," she
          answered.</p>
  <p>"He is married."</p>
  <p>"Heaven have pity on his poor wife!" was all the comment
          of Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"He has married Alice Challoner."</p>
  <p>She lifted her head then, in simple surprise. "Alice? Not
          Blanche?"</p>
  <p>"The story runs that he has played Blanche very false.
          That he had been with her much, leading on her
          expectations; and then he suddenly proposed for her
          young sister. I know nothing of the details myself:
          it is not likely: and I had heard nothing, until one
          evening at the club I saw the announcement of the
          marriage for the following day at St. George's. I
          was at the church the next morning before he
          was."</p>
  <p>"Not to stop it! not to intercept the marriage!"
          breathlessly uttered Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Certainly not. I had no power to attempt anything of the
          sort. I went to demand an answer to my question—what
          he had done with you, and where you were? He gave me
          this address, but said he knew nothing of your
          movements since December."</p>
  <p>There was a long silence. The earl appeared to be
          alternately ruminating and taking a survey of the
          room. Isabel sat with her head hanging down.</p>
  <p>"Why did you seek me out?" she presently broke <pb n="138"/> forth. "I am not worth it. I have
          brought enough disgrace upon your name."</p>
  <p>"And upon your husband's and upon your children's," he
          rejoined, in his most severe manner, for it was not
          in the nature of the Earl of Mount Severn to gloss
          over guilt. "Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me,
          as your nearest blood relative, to see after you,
          now that you are alone again, and to take care—so
          far as I can—that you do not lapse lower."</p>
  <p>He might have spared her that stab. But she scarcely
          understood him. She looked at him, wondering whether
          she did understand.</p>
  <p>"You have not a shilling in the world," he resumed. "How
          do you purpose to live?"</p>
  <p>"I have some money yet. When—"</p>
  <p>" <hi>His</hi> money?" sharply and haughtily interposed
          the earl.</p>
  <p>"No," she indignantly replied. "I am selling my trinkets.
          Before they are all gone, I shall try to earn a
          livelihood in some way: by teaching, probably."</p>
  <p>"Trinkets!" repeated Lord Mount Severn. "Mr. Carlyle told
          me that you carried nothing away with you from East
          Lynne."</p>
  <p>"Nothing that he had given me. These were mine before I
          married. You have seen Mr. Carlyle, then?" she
          faltered.</p>
  <p>"Seen him!" echoed the indignant earl. "When such a blow
          was dealt him by a member of my family, could I do
          less than hasten to East Lynne to tender my
          sympathies? I went with another object, also—to try
          to discover what could have been the moving springs
          of your conduct: for I protest, when the black
          tidings reached me, I believed that you must have
          gone mad. <pb n="139"/> You were one of the last
          whom I should have feared to trust. But I learned
          nothing, and Carlyle was ignorant as I. How could
          you strike him such a blow?"</p>
  <p>Lower and lower drooped her head, brighter shone the
          shame on her hectic cheek. An awful blow to Mr.
          Carlyle it must indeed have been: she was feeling it
          in all its bitter intensity. Lord Mount Severn read
          her repentant looks.</p>
  <p>"Isabel," he said, in a tone which had lost something of
          its harshness—and it was the first time he had
          called her by her christian name, "I see that you
          are reaping the fruits. Tell me how it happened.
          What demon prompted you to sell yourself to that bad
          man?"</p>
  <p>"He is a bad man," she exclaimed. "A base, heartless, bad
          man."</p>
  <p>"I warned you, at the commencement of your married life,
          to avoid him; to shun all association with him; not
          to admit him to your house."</p>
  <p>"His coming to East Lynne was not my doing," she
          whispered. "Mr. Carlyle invited him."</p>
  <p>"I know he did. Invited him in his unsuspicious
          confidence, believing his wife to <hi>be</hi> his
          wife, a trustworthy woman of honour," was the severe
          remark.</p>
  <p>She did not reply; she could not gainsay it: she only sat
          with her meek face of shame, and her eyelids
          drooping.</p>
  <p>"If ever a woman had a good husband, in every sense of
          the word, you had, in Carlyle: if ever man loved his
          wife, he loved you. <hi>How</hi> could you so
          requite him?"</p>
  <p>She rolled, in a confused manner, the corners of her
          shawl over her unconscious fingers.</p>
  <pb n="140"/>
  <p>"I read the note you left for your husband. He showed it
          me; the only one, I believe, to whom he did show it.
          It was to him entirely inexplicable; it was so to
          me. A notion had been suggested to him, after your
          departure, that his sister had somewhat marred your
          peace at East Lynne; and he blamed you much—if it
          were so—for not giving him your full confidence on
          the point, that he might have set matters on the
          right footing. But it was impossible (and there was
          the evidence in the note besides) that the presence
          of Miss Carlyle at East Lynne could be any excuse
          for your disgracing us all, and ruining
          yourself."</p>
  <p>"Do not let us speak of these things," said Lady Isabel,
          faintly. "It cannot redeem the past."</p>
  <p>"But I must speak of them; I am come to speak of them,"
          persisted the earl: "I could not do so whilst that
          man was here. When these inexplicable events take
          place in the career of a woman, it is a father's
          duty to look into motives and causes and actions;
          although the events in themselves may be, as in this
          case, irreparable. Your father is gone, but I stand
          in his place: there is no one else to stand in
          it."</p>
  <p>Her tears began to fall. And she let them fall—in
          silence. The earl resumed.</p>
  <p>"But for that extraordinary letter, I should have
          supposed you had been solely actuated by a mad
          infatuation for the cur, Levison: its tenor gave the
          affair a different aspect. To what did you allude
          when you asserted that your husband had driven you
          to it?"</p>
  <p>"He knew," she answered, scarcely above her breath.</p>
  <p>"He did not know," sternly replied the earl. "A more
          truthful, honourable man than Carlyle does not <pb n="141"/> exist on the face of the earth. When he
          told me then, in his agony of grief, that he was
          unable to form even a suspicion of your meaning, I
          could have staked my earldom on his veracity. I
          would stake it still."</p>
  <p>"I believed," she began, in a low, nervous voice, for she
          knew that there was no evading the questions of Lord
          Mount Severn, when he was resolved to have an
          answer, and, indeed, she was too weak, both in body
          and spirit, to resist—"I believed that his love was
          no longer mine; that he had deserted me for
          another."</p>
  <p>The earl stared at her. "What can you mean by 'deserted?'
          He was with you."</p>
  <p>"There is a desertion of the heart," was her murmured
          answer.</p>
  <p>"Desertion of a fiddlestick!" retorted his lordship. "The
          interpretation we gave to the note, I and Carlyle,
          was, that you had been actuated by motives of
          jealousy; had penned it in a jealous mood. I put the
          question to Carlyle—as between man and man—do you
          listen, Isabel?—whether he had given you cause; and
          he answered me, as with God over us. He had never
          given you cause: he had been faithful to you in
          thought word, and deed: he had never, so far as he
          could call to mind, even looked upon another woman
          with covetous feelings, since the hour that he made
          you his wife: his whole thoughts had been of you,
          and of you alone. It is more than many a husband can
          say," significantly coughed Lord Mount Severn.</p>
  <p>Her pulses were beating wildly. A powerful conviction,
          that the words were true; that her own blind
          jealousy had been utterly mistaken and unfounded,
          was forcing its way to her brain.</p>
  <p>"After that, I could only set your letter down as a <pb n="142"/> subterfuge," resumed the earl: "a false,
          barefaced plea, put forth to conceal your real
          motive: and I told Carlyle so. I inquired how it was
          he had never detected any secret understanding
          between you and that— that beast; located, as the
          fellow was, in the house. He replied, that no such
          suspicion had ever occurred to him. He placed the
          most implicit confidence in you, and would have
          trusted you with the man round the world; or with
          any one else."</p>
  <p>She entwined her hands one within the other, pressing
          them to pain. It could not deaden the pain at her
          heart.</p>
  <p>"Carlyle told me he had been unusually occupied during
          the stay of that man. Besides his customary office
          work, his time was taken up with some secret
          business for a family in the neighbourhood, and he
          had repeatedly to see them after office hours. Very
          old acquaintances of his, he said, relatives of the
          Carlyle family, and he was as anxious about the
          secret as they were. This, I observed to him, may
          have rendered him unobservant to what was passing at
          home. He told me, I remember, that on the evening of
          the—the catastrophe, he ought to have gone with you
          to a dinner-party, but most important circumstances
          arose, in connexion with the affair, which obliged
          him to meet two gentlemen at his office, and to
          receive them in secret, unknown to his clerks."</p>
  <p>"Did he—mention the name of the family?" inquired Lady
          Isabel, with white lips.</p>
  <p>"Yes he did. I forget it, though. Rabbit? Rabbit? some
          such name as that."</p>
  <p>"Was it Hare?"</p>
  <p>"That was it. Hare. He said you appeared vexed <pb n="143"/> that he did not accompany you to the
          dinner; perceiving this, he intended to go in
          afterwards, but was prevented. When the interview
          was over in his office, he was again detained at
          Mrs. Hare's house; and by business as impossible to
          avoid as the other."</p>
  <p>"Important business!" she echoed, giving way for a moment
          to the bitterness of former feelings. "He was
          promenading in their garden by moonlight with
          Barbara —Miss Hare. I saw them as my carriage
          passed."</p>
  <p>"And you were jealous!" exclaimed Lord Mount Severn, with
          mocking reproach, as he detected her mood. "Listen!"
          he whispered, bending his head towards her. "Whilst
          you thought, as your present tone would seem to
          intimate, that they were pacing there to enjoy each
          other's society, know that they— Carlyle, at any
          rate—was pacing the walk to keep guard. There was
          one within that house—for a short interview with his
          poor mother—one who lives in danger of the scaffold;
          to which his own father would be the first to
          deliver him up. They were keeping the path against
          that father, Carlyle and the young lady. Of all the
          nights in the previous seven years, that one only
          saw the unhappy son at home, for a half-hour's
          meeting with his mother and sister. Carlyle, in the
          grief and excitement caused by your conduct,
          confided so much to me, when mentioning what kept
          him from the dinner-party."</p>
  <p>Her face had become crimson; crimson at her past
          lamentable folly. And there was no redemption!</p>
  <p>"But he was always with Barbara Hare!" she murmured, by
          way of some faint excuse.</p>
  <p>"She had to see him upon this affair: her mother could
          not, for it was obliged to be kept from the father.
            <pb n="144"/> And so, you construed business
          interviews into assignations!" continued Lord Mount
          Severn, with cutting derision. "I had given you
          credit for better sense. But was <hi>this</hi>
          enough to hurl you on to the step you took? Surely
          not! You must have yielded to the persuasions of
          that wicked man."</p>
  <p>"It is all over now," she wailed.</p>
  <p>"Carlyle was true and faithful to you, and to you alone.
          Few women have the chance of happiness, in their
          married life, in the degree that you had. He is an
          upright and good man; one of nature's gentlemen; one
          that England may be proud of, as having grown upon
          her soil. The more I see of him, the greater becomes
          my admiration of him, and of his thorough honour. Do
          you know what he did in the matter of the
          damages?"</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>"He did not wish to proceed for damages; or, only for the
          trifling sum demanded by law; but the jury, feeling
          for his wrongs, gave unprecedentedly heavy ones.
          Since the fellow came into his baronetcy they have
          been paid: Carlyle immediately handed them over to
          the country hospital. He holds the apparently
          obsolete opinion, that money cannot wipe out a
          wife's dishonour."</p>
  <p>"Let us close these topics," implored the poor invalid.
          "I acted wickedly and madly: and I have the
          consequence to bear for ever. More I cannot
          say."</p>
  <p>"Where do you intend to fix your future residence?"
          inquired the earl.</p>
  <p>"I am unable to tell. I shall leave this town as soon as
          I am well enough."</p>
  <pb n="145"/>
  <p>"Ay. It cannot be pleasant for you to remain under the
          eyes of its inhabitants. You were here with him,
          were you not?"</p>
  <p>"They think I am his wife," she murmured. "The servants
          think it."</p>
  <p>"That's well; so far. How many servants have you?"</p>
  <p>"Two. I am not strong enough yet to do much myself, so am
          obliged to keep two," she continued, as if in
          apology for the extravagance, under her reduced
          circumstances. "As soon as ever the baby can walk, I
          shall manage to do with one."</p>
  <p>The earl looked confounded. "The baby!" he uttered, in a
          tone of astonishment and grief, painful to her to
          hear. "Isabel! is there a child?"</p>
  <p>Not less painful was her own emotion as she hid her face.
          Lord Mount Severn rose, and paced the room with
          striding steps.</p>
  <p>"I did not know it! I did not know it! Wicked, heartless
          villain! He ought to have married you before its
          birth. Was the divorce out previously?" he added,
          stopping short in his strides to ask it.</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Coward! sneak! May good men shun him, from henceforth!
          may his Queen refuse to receive him! You, an earl's
          daughter! Oh, Isabel! How utterly you have lost
          yourself!"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel started from her chair, in a burst of
          hysterical sobs, her hands extended beseechingly
          towards the earl. "Spare me! spare me! You have been
          rending my heart ever since you came: indeed I am
          too weak to bear it."</p>
  <p>The earl, in truth, had been betrayed into showing <pb n="146"/> more of his sentiments than he intended.
          He recalled his recollection.</p>
  <p>"Well, well, sit down again, Isabel," he said, putting
          her into her chair. "We will go to the point I
          chiefly came here to settle. What sum will it take
          you to live upon? Quietly: as of course you would
          now wish to live; but comfortably."</p>
  <p>"I will not accept anything," she replied. "I will get my
          own living:" and the earl's irascibility again rose
          at the speech. He spoke in a sharp tone:</p>
  <p>"Absurd, Isabel! Do not add romantic folly to your other
          mistakes. Get your own living, indeed! As much as is
          necessary for you to live upon, I shall supply. No
          remonstrance: I tell you I am acting as for your
          father. Do you suppose he would have abandoned you,
          to starve or to work?"</p>
  <p>The allusion touched every chord within her bosom, and
          the tears fell fast. "I thought I could get my
          living by teaching," she sobbed.</p>
  <p>"And how much did you anticipate the teaching would bring
          you in?"</p>
  <p>"Not very much," she listlessly said. "A hundred a year,
          perhaps: I am very clever at music and singing. That
          sum might keep us, I fancy, even if I only went out
          by day."</p>
  <p>"And a fine 'keep' it would be! You shall have that sum
          every quarter!"</p>
  <p>"No, no! oh no! I do not deserve it; I could not accept
          it. I have forfeited all claim to assistance."</p>
  <p>"Not to mine. Now, it is of no use to excite yourself,
          for my mind is made up. I never willingly forego a
          duty, and I look upon this not only as a duty, but
          an imperative one. Upon my return, I shall
          immediately <pb n="147"/> settle four hundred a year
          upon you, and you can draw it quarterly."</p>
  <p>"Then half the sum," she reiterated, knowing how useless
          it was to contend with Lord Mount Severn when he got
          upon the stilts of "duty." "Indeed, two hundred a
          year will be ample; it will seem like riches to
          me."</p>
  <p>"I have named the sum, Isabel, and I shall not make it
          less. A hundred pounds every three months shall be
          paid to you, dating from this day. This does not
          count," he continued, laying down some notes upon
          the table.</p>
  <p>"Indeed I have some ready money by me," she urged, her
          cheeks flushing at what she looked upon as unmerited
          kindness: for none could think worse of her than she
          did of herself. "Pray take it back: you are too good
          to me."</p>
  <p>"I don't know what you call 'ready money,'" returned the
          earl, "but you have just informed me you were
          selling your trinkets to live upon. Put up the
          notes, Isabel: they are only a small amount, just to
          go on with. Are you in debt?"</p>
  <p>"Oh no."</p>
  <p>"And mind you don't get into it," advised the earl, as he
          rose to depart. "You can let me hear of you from
          time to time, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"What does the world say of me?" she took courage to
          whisper. It was a question often in her own mind.
          Lord Mount Severn paused before he replied,
          marvelling, probably, that she could ask it.</p>
  <p>"Just what you may have said in the days now over, at any
          who had gone the way that you have done. What did
          you expect that it would say?"</p>
  <pb n="148"/>
  <p>What indeed! She stood there with her humble face and her
          beating heart. The earl took her hand within his in
          token of farewell: turned, and was gone.</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn, stern and uncompromising as he was,
          had yet a large share of kindness and
          conscientiousness. From the moment he heard of the
          false step taken by Lady Isabel, and that it was
          with Francis Levison she had flown, he cast more
          blame than he had ever done upon the conduct of his
          wife, in having forced her—so he regarded it—upon
          Mr. Carlyle. In short, he considered his wife as the
          primary, though remote, cause of the present ill:
          not that he in the slightest degree underrated Lady
          Isabel's own share in it; quite the contrary. From
          this motive, no less than that he was her blood
          relative, he deemed it his duty to see after her in
          her shame and sadness.</p>
  <p>Susanne attended Lord Mount Severn to the door and
          watched him down the street, thinking what a "brave
          Monsieur Anglais" he was, and how delighted miladi
          must be at seeing a friend, to break the monotony of
          her sick and lonely existence. Susanne made no doubt
          that the visit must so far have aroused miladi as to
          set her thinking about getting out her smart dresses
          once more, and that the first words she should hear,
          on entering miladi's presence, would touch on that
          attractive point.</p>
  <p>The Earl of Mount Severn returned to the Hôtel des
          Ambassadeurs, dined, and slept there, and the
          following morning quitted it on his return to the
          pleasures and bustle of civilised life. And Lady
          Isabel remained on in her chamber, alone.</p>
  <p>Alone: alone! <hi>Alone</hi> for evermore!</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIII. BARBARA'S MISDOINGS.</head>
  <p><hi>A sunny</hi> afternoon in summer. More correctly
          speaking, it may be said a summer's evening, for the
          bright beams were already slanting athwart the
          substantial garden of Mr. Justice Hare, and the tea
          hour, seven, was passing. Mr. and Mrs. Hare and
          Barbara were seated at the meal: somehow, meals
          always did seem in process at Justice Hare's: if it
          was not breakfast, it was luncheon; if it was not
          luncheon, it was dinner; if it was not dinner, it
          was tea. Barbara sat in tears, for the justice was
          giving her a "piece of his mind," and poor Mrs.
          Hare, agreeing with her husband (as she would have
          done had he proposed to set the house on fire and
          burn her up in it) yet sympathising with Barbara,
          moved uneasily in her chair.</p>
  <p>Barbara had been giving mortal offence. Barbara had been
          giving the same offence occasionally for some years
          past: she had just refused an eligible offer of
          marriage, and the justice was storming over it. In
          the abstract, it was of no moment whatever to Mr.
          Justice Hare whether his daughters pined and
          withered out their days as fading maidens, or
          whether they raced through life bustling matrons.
          Neither, in the abstract, did the justice want
          Barbara away from the paternal home, or <pb n="150"/> deem her an incumbrance within it: on the
          contrary, were Barbara absent, he might be at fault
          for a target at which to shoot the arrows of his
          hard words. Neither had money anything to do with
          it: whether Barbara married or whether she remained
          single, she had an ample fortune. No: the anger of
          Justice Hare at Barbara's refusing the offers made
          to her, had nothing to do with ordinary causes.</p>
  <p>How the world would get on without gossip, I'll leave the
          world to judge. That West Lynne could not have got
          on without it, and without interfering in
          everybody's business but its own, is enough for me.
          West Lynne had chosen to make a wonder of the fact
          that Barbara Hare should remain Barbara Hare. Of all
          the damsels indigenous to the soil, she, with her
          beauty, her attractive manners, and her good
          fortune, had appeared the most likely one to be
          appropriated. And yet she was still Barbara Hare!
          The gossips set their heads together to discover why
          she was neglected. <hi>Neglected</hi> they
          considered her, for Barbara was not one to talk of
          opportunities refused. The conclusion they came to
          was, that the unhappy crime attaching to her brother
          was the sole cause; and, by some mishap, this
          nonsense reached the ears of Justice Hare. If the
          justice was sensitive upon one point, it was upon
          what related to that dark and dreadful deed; if he
          was bitter against any living being, it was against
          his miserable son. To have it said that Barbara
          remained single because no one would have her on
          account of her brother, was gall and wormwood to
          Justice Hare, for the disgrace seemed then to be
          reflecting home on <hi>him</hi> and his. The justice
          would have liked to lift his foot and toss West
          Lynne into the nearest, and greenest, and muddiest
          of ponds, there <pb n="151"/> to struggle together
          and cool their tongues; he would have liked to
          pounce on Richard, and hand him over to the mercies
          of the county assize; and he would have liked to
          marry Barbara off hand, that <hi>that</hi> part of
          the scandal at any rate might be refuted. Therefore,
          when Barbara refused offer after offer (four she had
          refused now), it may readily be credited how greatly
          it aroused the ire of the justice.</p>
  <p>"You do it for the purpose; you do it to anger me,"
          thundered the justice, bringing down his hand on the
          tea-table and causing the cups to rattle.</p>
  <p>"No I don't, papa," sobbed Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Then why <hi>do</hi> you do it?"</p>
  <p>Barbara was silent.</p>
  <p>"No; you can't answer: you have nothing to urge. What is
          the matter, pray, with Major Thorn? Come, I will be
          answered."</p>
  <p>"I don't like him," faltered Barbara.</p>
  <p>"You do like him; you are telling me an untruth. You have
          liked him well enough whenever he has been
          here."</p>
  <p>"I like him as an acquintance, papa. Not as a
          husband."</p>
  <p>"Not as a husband!" repeated the exasperated justice.
          "Why, bless my heart and body, the girl's going mad!
          Not as a husband! Who asked you to like him as a
          husband before he became such? Did you ever hear
          that it was necessary, or expedient, or becoming for
          a young lady to set on and begin to 'like' a
          gentleman as 'her husband?'"</p>
  <p>Barbara felt a little bewildered.</p>
  <p>"Here's the whole parish saying that Barbara Hare can't
          be married, that nobody will have her on account <pb n="152"/> of—of—of that cursed stain left by—I
          won't trust myself to name him, I should go too far.
          Now don't you think that's a pretty disgrace, a fine
          state of things?"</p>
  <p>"But it is not true," said Barbara; "people do propose
          for me."</p>
  <p>"But what's the use of their proposing when you say No?"
          raved the justice. "Is that the way to let the
          parish know that they propose? You are an
          ungrateful, rebellious, self-willed daughter, and
          you'll never be otherwise."</p>
  <p>Barbara's tears flowed freely. The justice gave a dash at
          the bell-handle, to order the tea-things carried
          away; and after their removal the subject was
          renewed, together with Barbara's grief. That was the
          worst of Justice Hare. Let him seize hold of a
          grievance (it was not often he got upon a real one)
          and he kept on at it, like a blacksmith hammering at
          his forge. In the midst of a stormy oration, tongue
          and hands going together, Mr. Carlyle came in.</p>
  <p>Not much altered; not much. A year and three-quarters had
          gone by, and they had served to silver his hair upon
          the temples. His manner, too, would never again be
          careless and light as it once had been. He was the
          same keen man of business, the same pleasant,
          intelligent companion: the generality of people saw
          no change in him. Barbara rose to escape.</p>
  <p>"No," said Justice Hare, planting himself between her and
          the door; "that's the way you like to get out of my
          reach when I am talking to you. You won't go; so sit
          down again. I'll tell you of all your ill-conduct
          before Mr. Carlyle, and see if that will shame
          you."</p>
  <pb n="153"/>
  <p>Barbara resumed her seat, a rush of crimson dyeing her
          cheeks. And Mr. Carlyle looked inquiringly, seeming
          to ask an explanation of her distress. The justice
          gave it after his own fashion.</p>
  <p>"You know, Carlyle, that horrible blow that fell upon us,
          that shameful disgrace. Well, because the parish
          can't clack enough about the fact itself, it must
          begin upon Barbara. Saying that the disgrace and
          humiliation are reflected upon her, and that nobody
          will come near her to ask her to be his wife. One
          would think, rather than lie under the stigma and
          afford the parish room to talk, she'd marry the
          first man that came, if it was the parish
          beadle—anybody else would. But now, what are the
          facts? You'll stare when you know them. She has
          received a bushel of good offers, a bushel of them,"
          repeated the justice, dashing his hand down on his
          knee, "and she says No to all. The last was to-day,
          from Major Thorn, and my young lady takes and puts
          the stopper upon it, as usual, without reference to
          me or her mother, without saying with your leave or
          by your leave. She wants to be kept in her room for
          a week upon bread-and-water, to bring her to her
          senses."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced at Barbara. She was sitting meekly
          under the infliction, her wet eyelashes falling on
          her flushed cheeks and shading her eyes. The justice
          was heated enough, and had pushed his flaxen wig
          wrong side before in the warmth of his argument.</p>
  <p>"What do you say to her?" snapped the justice.</p>
  <p>"Matrimony may not have charms for Barbara," replied Mr.
          Carlyle half jokingly.</p>
  <p>"Nothing has charms for her that ought to have," growled
          Justice Hare. "She's one of the contrary <pb n="154"/> ones. By the way, though," hastily resumed the
          justice, leaving the objectionable subject, as
          another flashed across his memory, "they were
          coupling your name and matrimony together, Carlyle,
          last night at the Buck's Head."</p>
  <p>A very perceptible tinge of red rose to the face of Mr.
          Carlyle, telling of inward emotion, but his voice
          and manner betrayed none.</p>
  <p>"Indeed," he carelessly said.</p>
  <p>"Ah, you are a sly one; you are, Carlyle: remember how
          sly you were with your first—" marriage, Justice
          Hare was going to bring out, but it suddenly
          occurred to him that, all circumstances considered,
          it was not precisely the topic to recall to Mr.
          Carlyle. So he stopped himself in the utterance,
          coughed and went on again. "There you go, over to
          Sir John Dobede's, <hi>not</hi> to see Sir John, but
          paying court to Miss Dobede."</p>
  <p>"So the Buck's Head was amusing itself with that!"
          good-humouredly observed Mr. Carlyle. "Well, Miss
          Dobede is going to be married, and I am drawing up
          the settlements."</p>
  <p>"It's not she; she marries young Somerset; every body
          knows that. It's the other one, Louisa. A nice girl,
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Very," responded Mr. Carlyle, and it was all the answer
          he gave. The justice, tired of sitting in doors,
          tired, perhaps, of extracting nothing satisfactory
          from Mr. Carlyle, rose, set his wig aright before
          the chimney-glass, and quitted the house on his
          customary evening visit to the Buck's Head. Barbara,
          who watched him down the path, saw that he
          encountered some one who happened to be passing the
          gate. She could not at first distinguish who it
          might be, nothing but an arm <pb n="155"/> and
          shoulder, cased in velveteen, met her view, but as
          their positions changed in conversation, she saw
          that it was Locksley, who had been the chief witness
          (not a vindictive one; he could not help himself)
          against her brother Richard, touching the murder of
          Hallijohn.</p>
  <p>"What can be the matter with papa?" exclaimed Barbara.
          "Locksley must have said something to anger him. He
          is coming in in the greatest passion, mamma: his
          face crimson, and his hands and arms working."</p>
  <p>"Oh dear, Barbara!" was all poor Mrs. Hare's reply. The
          justice's great gusts of passion frightened her.</p>
  <p>In he came, closed the door, and stood in the middle of
          the room, looking alternately at Mrs. Hare and
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"What is this cursed report that's being whispered in the
          place?" quoth he, in a tone of suppressed rage, but
          not unmixed with awe.</p>
  <p>"What report?" asked Mr. Carlyle, for the justice waited
          for an answer, and Mrs. Hare seemed unable to speak.
          Barbara took care to keep silence: she had some
          misgiving that the justice's words might be
          referring to herself, to the recent grievance.</p>
  <p>"A report that he— <hi>he</hi> —has been here, disguised
          as a labourer! has dared to show himself in the
          place, where he'll come yet to the gibbet."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare's face turned as white as death. Mr. Carlyle
          rose, and dexterously contrived to stand before her,
          so that it should not be seen. Barbara silently
          locked her hands, one within the other, and turned
          to the window.</p>
  <p>"Of whom do you speak?" asked Mr. Carlyle, in a <pb n="156"/> matter-of-fact tone, as if he were
          putting the most matter-of-fact question. He knew
          too well; but he sought to temporise for the sake of
          Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"Of whom do I speak!" uttered the exasperated justice,
          nearly beside himself with passion: "of whom should
          I speak, but the bastard Dick? Who else in West
          Lynne is likely to come to a felon's death?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard!" sobbed forth Mrs. Hare, as she sank back
          in her chair, "be merciful! He is our own true
          son."</p>
  <p>"Never a true son of the Hares," raved the justice. "A
          true son of wickedness, and cowardice, and blight,
          and evil. If he has dared to show his face at West
          Lynne, I'll set the whole police of England upon his
          track, that he may be brought here as he ought, if
          he must come. When Locksley told me of it, just now,
          I raised my hand to knock him down, so infamously
          false did I deem the report. Do <hi>you</hi> know
          anything of his having been here?" continued the
          justice to his wife, in a pointed, resolute
          tone.</p>
  <p>How Mrs. Hare would have extricated herself, or what she
          would have answered, cannot even be imagined, but
          Mr. Carlyle interposed.</p>
  <p>"You are frightening Mrs. Hare, sir. Don't you see that
          the very report of such a thing is alarming her into
          illness? But—allow me to inquire what it may be that
          Locksley said."</p>
  <p>"I met him at the gate," returned Justice Hare, turning
          his attention upon Mr. Carlyle. "He was going by as
          I reached it. 'Oh, justice,' he began, 'I am glad I
          met you. There's a nasty report in the place, that
          Richard has been seen here. I'd see what I could do
          towards hushing it up, sir, if I were you, for <pb n="157"/> it may only serve to put the police in
          mind of bygone things, which it may be better they
          should forget.' Carlyle, I went, as I tell you, to
          knock him down: I asked him how he could have the
          hardihood to repeat such slander to my face. He was
          on the high horse directly: said the parish spoke
          the slander, not he; and I got out of him what it
          was he had heard."</p>
  <p>"And what was it?" interrupted Mr. Carlyle, more eagerly
          than he generally spoke.</p>
  <p>"Why, they say that the fellow showed himself here some
          time ago, a year or so, disguised as a farm labourer
          —confounded fools! Not but what he'd have been the
          fool, had he done it."</p>
  <p>"To be sure he would," repeated Mr. Carlyle, "and he is
          not fool enough for that, sir. Let West Lynne talk,
          Mr. Hare: but do not you put faith in a word of its
          gossip. I never do. Poor Richard, wherever he may
          be—"</p>
  <p>"I won't have him pitied in my presence," burst forth the
          justice. "Poor Richard, indeed! Villain Richard, if
          you please."</p>
  <p>"I was about to observe that wherever he may be, whether
          in the backwoods of America, or digging for gold in
          California, or wandering about the United Kingdom,
          there is little fear that he will quit his place of
          safety, to dare the dangerous ground of West Lynne.
          Had I been you, sir, I should have laughed at
          Locksley and his words."</p>
  <p>"Why does West Lynne invent such lies?"</p>
  <p>"Ah, there's the rub. I dare say West Lynne could not
          tell why, if it were paid for doing it. But it seems
          to have been a lame story it has got up this time.
          If they must have concocted a report that Richard
          had <pb n="158"/> been seen at West Lynne, why put
          it back to a year ago; why not have fixed it for
          to-day or yesterday? If I heard anything more, I
          would treat it with the silence and contempt it
          deserves, justice."</p>
  <p>Silence and contempt were not greatly in the justice's
          line; noise and explosion were more so. But he had a
          high opinion of the judgment of Mr. Carlyle; and,
          growling a sort of assent, he once more set forth to
          pay his evening visit.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald!" uttered Mrs. Hare, when her husband was
          half way down the path, "what a mercy that you were
          here! I should inevitably have betrayed myself."</p>
  <p>Barbara turned round from the window. "But what could
          have possessed Locksley to say what he did?" she
          exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"I have no doubt Locksley spoke with a good motive," said
          Mr. Carlyle. "He is not unfriendly to Richard, and
          thought, probably, that by telling Mr. Hare of the
          report, he might get it stopped. The rumour has been
          mentioned to me."</p>
  <p>Barbara turned cold all over. "How can it have come to
          light?" she breathed.</p>
  <p>"I am at a loss to know," said Mr. Carlyle. "The person
          to mention it to me was Tom Herbert. He met me
          yesterday, and said, 'What's this row about Dick
          Hare?' 'What row?' I asked him. 'Why, that Dick was
          at West Lynne some time back, disguised as a farm
          labourer.'—Just what Locksley said to Mr. Hare. I
          laughed at Tom Herbert," continued Mr. Carlyle;
          "turned his report into ridicule, and made him turn
          it into ridicule also, before I had done with
          him."</p>
  <pb n="159"/>
  <p>"Will it be the means of causing Richard's detection?"
          murmured Mrs. Hare from between her dry lips.</p>
  <p>"No, no," warmly responded Mr. Carlyle. "Had the report
          arisen immediately after he was really here, it
          might not have been so pleasant: but nearly two
          years have elapsed since the period. Be under no
          uneasiness, dear Mrs. Hare, for rely upon it there
          is no cause."</p>
  <p>"But how <hi>could</hi> it have come out, Archibald?" she
          urged. "And at this distant period of time!"</p>
  <p>"I assure you I am quite at a loss to imagine. Had
          anybody at West Lynne seen and recognised Richard,
          they would have spoken of it at the time. Do not let
          it trouble you: the rumour will die away."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare sighed deeply, and left the room to proceed to
          her chamber. Barbara and Mr. Carlyle were alone.</p>
  <p>"Oh, that the real murderer could be discovered!" she
          aspirated, clasping her hands. "To be subjected to
          these shocks of fear is dreadful. Mamma will not be
          herself for days to come."</p>
  <p>"I wish the right man could be found; but it seems as far
          off as ever," remarked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Barbara sat ruminating. It seemed that she had something
          to say to Mr. Carlyle, but a feeling caused her to
          hesitate. When she did at length speak, it was in a
          low, timid voice.</p>
  <p>"You remember the description Richard gave, that last
          night—of the person he had met—the true Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Did it strike you then—has it ever occurred to you to
          think—that it accorded with—with some one?"</p>
  <p>"In what way, Barbara?" he asked after a pause. <pb n="160"/> "It accorded with the description
          Richard always gave of the main Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Richard spoke of the peculiar movement of throwing off
          the hair from the forehead—in this way. Did that
          strike you as being familiar—in connexion with the
          white hand and the diamond ring?"</p>
  <p>"Many have a habit of pushing off their hair: I think I
          do it myself sometimes. Barbara, what do you mean?
          Have you a suspicion of any one?"</p>
  <p>"Have you?" she returned, answering the question by
          asking another.</p>
  <p>"I have not. Since Captain Thorn was disposed of, my
          suspicions have not pointed anywhere."</p>
  <p>This sealed Barbara's lips. She had hers; certain vague
          doubts, bringing wonder more than anything else. At
          times she had thought the same doubts might have
          occurred to Mr. Carlyle, she now found that they had
          not. The terrible domestic calamity which had
          happened to Mr. Carlyle the same night that Richard
          protested he had seen Thorn, had prevented Barbara
          discussing the matter with him then; and she had
          never done so since. Richard had not been further
          heard of, and the affair had remained in
          abeyance.</p>
  <p>"I begin to despair of its ever being discovered," she
          observed. "What will become of poor Richard?"</p>
  <p>"The discovery that Thorn was not the Thorn completely
          checkmated us," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It would have done so, had Richard not seen the
          other."</p>
  <p>"I have had my doubts whether that was not, after all, a
          flight of Richard's imagination. It is so
          extraordinary that he should meet the man by
          moonlight, and that nothing should have been seen of
          him at any <pb n="161"/> other time; before or
          after. Richard's mind was imbued with the thought
          and image of Thorn, and fancy may have conjured up
          his appearance in some ordinary passer-by."</p>
  <p>"That it never did!" cried Barbara. "I wish I was as sure
          of heaven, as that Richard saw Thorn that night. You
          believed it yourself at the time."</p>
  <p>"I did. His earnestness impressed me. But I had not had
          time to reflect upon the facts. There was no one at
          West Lynne then, neither has there been since, to
          whom Richard's description could apply; Captain
          Thorn excepted."</p>
  <p>"At West Lynne—no," said Barbara.</p>
  <p>"We can but wait, and hope that time may bring forth its
          own elucidation," concluded Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Ah," sighed Barbara, "but it is weary waiting; weary,
          weary!"</p>
  <p>"How is it you contrive to get under the paternal
          displeasure?" he resumed, in a gayer tone.</p>
  <p>She blushed vividly: and it was her only answer.</p>
  <p>"The Major Thorn, alluded to by your papa, is our old
          friend, I presume?"</p>
  <p>Barbara inclined her head.</p>
  <p>"He is a very pleasant man, Barbara. Many a young lady
          would be proud to have him."</p>
  <p>"Yes, he is a pleasant man," quietly answered Barbara,
          but she spoke in a tone that did not invite further
          discussion.</p>
  <p>Captain Thorn, in visiting the Herberts in time gone by,
          had been much struck with Barbara. Had his
          circumstances allowed, he would have solicited her
          to become his wife then. Recently, he had acquired
          some property by inheritance, and had also been <pb n="162"/> promoted a step in his profession. The
          first use he made of his ease, was to write both to
          Barbara and her father. Barbara declined his offer,
          as you have seen, and the justice would be quite
          sure not to let her hear the last of it for some
          time to come.</p>
  <p>"You will do all you can to quell this rumour touching
          Richard," she said to Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Depend upon that. The less Richard's name is heard in
          West Lynne, the better. It puzzles me to know how it
          can have arisen."</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Barbara broke it: but she did not look
          at Mr. Carlyle as she spoke. "The other rumour: is
          it a correct one?"</p>
  <p>"What other rumour?"</p>
  <p>"That you are to marry Louisa Dobede."</p>
  <p>"It is not. I have no intention of marrying any one. Nay,
          I will say it more strongly: it is my intention not
          to marry any one; to remain as I am."</p>
  <p>Barbara lifted her eyes to his in the surprise of the
          moment.</p>
  <p>"You look amazed, Barbara. No. She—who was my
          wife—lives."</p>
  <p>"What of that?" uttered Barbara, in simplicity.</p>
  <p>He did not answer for a moment, and when he did, it was
          in a low tone, as he stood by the table at which
          Barbara sat, and looked down upon her.</p>
  <p>"'Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
          committeth adultery.'"</p>
  <p>And before Barbara could answer—if, indeed, she had found
          any answer to make—or had recovered her surprise, he
          had taken his hat and was gone.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIV. AN ACCIDENT.</head>
  <p><hi>To</hi> return for a short while to Lady Isabel. As
          the year advanced she grew stronger, and in the
          latter part of the summer made preparations for
          quitting Grenoble. Where she would fix her
          residence, or what she would do, she knew not. She
          was miserable and restless, and cared little what
          became of her. The remotest spot on earth, on
          unpenetrated by the steps of civilised man, appeared
          the most desirable to her. Where was she to find
          this?</p>
  <p>She set out on her search—she, the child, and a young
          peasant woman whom she had engaged as
            <hi>bonne;</hi> for Susanne having a lover at
          Grenoble entirely declined to leave the place. All
          her luggage, except the things absolutely requisite,
          Lady Isabel had forwarded to Paris, there to be
          warehoused until she sent further directions. It was
          a lovely day when she quitted Grenoble. The train
          travelled safely until in the dusk of the evening
          they approached a place called Cammère, where Lady
          Isabel proposed to rest for a day or two. Railway
          accidents are less frequent in France than they are
          with us, but when they do occur they are wholesale
          catastrophes, the memory of which lasts for a life
          time. The train was within a short distance of the
          station <pb n="164"/> when there came a sudden shock
          and crash as of the day of doom; and engine,
          carriages, and passengers lay in one confused mass
          at the foot of a steep embankment. The gathering
          darkness added to the awful confusion.</p>
  <p>The carriage, in which Lady Isabel with her child and
            <hi>bonne</hi> travelled, lay beneath a
          superincumbent mass of ruins: they were amongst the
          last passengers to be extricated. The <hi>bonne</hi>
          and the poor baby were quite dead. Lady Isabel was
          alive and conscious, but so severely injured that
          the medical men who had been brought to the spot in
          all haste turned from her to give their attention to
          other sufferers whose case seemed less desperate—she
          heard them say that she would not survive
          amputation, and that nothing else could be done,
          that she must die whether there were an operation or
          not. The injuries lay in one leg, and the lower part
          of her face. She had not counted upon dying in this
          manner, and death in the guise of horrible suffering
          was not the abstract thing of release and escape
          which it had seemed, when she had wished for it as
          the end of all her wretchedness. She was unable to
          move, but the shock had deadened sensation, she was
          not yet in pain, and her mind was for a short
          interval preternaturally clear and lucid. A Sister
          of Charity approached the stretcher on which she had
          been laid, and offered her some water. Isabel drank
          eagerly.</p>
  <p>"Is there aught else I can do?" asked the sister.</p>
  <p>"My baby and its nurse were with me in the carriage —tell
          me, have they been found? is my child killed?" asked
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>The sister turned to gain intelligence if she could, but
          the confusion and noise were so great that she could
          scarcely hope to ascertain anything with certainty.
          A poor little child quite dead, but not much
          disfigured, <pb n="165"/> had been carried into the
          railway shed, and laid down not far from Lady
          Isabel. The sister took it tenderly up.</p>
  <p>"Was this your child?" said she turning to Lady Isabel.
          "It is a little angel, and is beholding the face of
          its Father in Heaven."</p>
  <p>It was the ill-starred child of Lady Isabel: she pressed
          its little face to her bosom, and her first feeling
          was a deep thankfulness that it had been so soon
          taken away from the evil to come. She believed she
          was to die also in the space of a few hours, or
          less; and the dull, apathetic indifference to all
          belonging to this life, which generally sets in with
          the approach of death, was stealing over her. She
          motioned to the sister to remove it, saying
          softly,</p>
  <p>"It is thus I would have wished it to be."</p>
  <p>"Have you no message or instructions for your friends? If
          you will trust me I will fulfil your wishes. Whilst
          your mind is preserved clear, it will be well to
          settle your duties towards those you are leaving
          behind." The sister had heard what the doctor said
          of Lady Isabel's condition.</p>
  <p>"All who ever knew me will rejoice to hear that I am no
          more," said Isabel. "My death will be the only
          reparation I can offer, for the grief and shame my
          life has brought on all who had the evil fortune to
          belong to me. You understand I have been a great
          sinner."</p>
  <p>"Try to accept death as a just recompense for your
          sins—make in this last moment an act of faith and
          obedience, by uniting your own will with His who
          sends this suffering; it is then changed from the
          nature of punishment into a blessing. Our sorrows
          are the gifts of Almighty God, no less than our
          joys."</p>
  <p>"I will, I have taken up my cross," said Lady <pb n="166"/> Isabel faintly, for the pain of her injuries was
          beginning to make itself felt.</p>
  <p>"Can I write to any one for you?" asked the sister, "tell
          me now, whilst you can think of it."</p>
  <p>"Have you paper and writing things at hand? write
          then—direct the letter first, to the Earl of Mount
          —stay!" she interrupted, feeling how undesirable it
          was to make known her private affairs, even in that
          strange place. Besides, from the injury to her face,
          she could only speak with the greatest difficulty.
          "Could I not write a line myself? I think I could,
          if you will hold the paper before me: my hands are
          not injured; my intellect is clear."</p>
  <p>The compassionate sister complied: and Lady Isabel
          contrived to scrawl a few words as she lay, first
          directing the letter to the earl's town house. They
          were to the effect that she was dying from the fatal
          injuries of the railway accident: that her baby was
          killed, and its nurse. She thanked Lord Mount Severn
          for all his goodness to her; she said she was glad
          to die, to deliver him and all who belonged to her
          from the disgrace and shame she had been to them.
          "Go to Mr. Carlyle," she continued, "say that I
          humbly beg him to forgive me; that I also beg the
          forgiveness of his children when they shall be old
          enough to know the crime I have committed against
          them: tell him I repent, and have repented
          bitterly—there are no words to express that
          bitterness." She had written so far, when the
          torture of pain, which had begun to make itself more
          and more felt, was becoming intolerable. Gathering
          her strength for a last effort, she wrote in
          characters, like those that one on the rack might
          have signed his confession, "Forgive; Isabel," and
          whispered, <pb n="167"/> "Send it when I am dead;
          not before: and add a few words of
          confirmation."</p>
  <p>When at length the surgeons came up to Lady Isabel, to
          examine more minutely the injuries she had
          sustained, she was quite insensible, and they
          thought she was dead. They said so to the sister,
          who was then kneeling beside her, repeating the
          prayers appointed for the passing soul. She finished
          them and retired to a distance, other sufferers
          claiming her services. She did not return to Lady
          Isabel, whom she fully believed to be dead; and she
          despatched the letter, writing in it as requested,
          some words of confirmation. The dead were buried,
          and a special mass was said for them. The survivors
          were sent to the hospital; all that could be done
          for them was done; neither skill nor kindness being
          wanting.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel recovered her consciousness, and found
          herself lying on a pallet in a ward in the hospital.
          It was long before she could recal what had
          happened, or understood that she had not died. The
          surgeons, on further inspection, had found life
          still lingering in her shattered frame. The injuries
          were terrible enough, but not of necessity fatal,
          though the prospect of recovery was faint. It would
          have been cruel to resort to an operation with such
          slender chances of success, and they tried other
          means, which to the honour and glory of their skill,
          promised to succeed. Lady Isabel was still
          fluctuating between life and death; but the tide
          began at length slowly to set in towards life. She
          remained three months in the hospital before she
          could be removed. The change that had passed over
          her in those three months was little less than death
          itself; no one could have recognised in the pale,
          thin, shattered, crippled invalid, she who had been
          known as Lady Isabel Vane.</p>
  <pb n="168"/>
  <p>The letter was duly delivered at the town house of Lord
          Mount Severn, as addressed. The countess was
          sojourning there for a few days: she had quitted it
          after the season, but some business, or pleasure,
          had called her again to town. Lord Vane was with
          her, but the earl was in Scotland. They were at
          breakfast, she and her son, when the letter was
          brought in: eightpence to pay. Its strangely written
          address; its foreign aspect; its appearance,
          altogether, excited her curiosity: in her own mind
          she believed she had dropped upon a nice little
          conjugal mare's nest.</p>
  <p>"I shall open this," cried she.</p>
  <p>"Why, it is addressed to papa!" exclaimed Lord Vane, who
          possessed all his father's notions of honour.</p>
  <p>"But such an odd letter! It may require an immediate
          answer: or is some begging petition, perhaps. Go on
          with your breakfast."</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn opened the letter, and with some
          difficulty spelt through its contents. They shocked
          even her.</p>
  <p>"How dreadful!" she uttered, in the impulse of the
          moment.</p>
  <p>"What is dreadful?" asked Lord Vane, looking up from his
          breakfast.</p>
  <p>"Lady Isabel—Isabel Vane—you have not forgotten her?"</p>
  <p>"Forgotten her!" he echoed. "Why, mamma, I must possess a
          funny memory to have forgotten her already."</p>
  <p>"She is dead. She has been killed in a railway accident
          in France."</p>
  <p>His large eyes, honest and true as they had been in
          childhood, filled, and his face flushed. He said
          nothing, for emotion was strong within him.</p>
  <pb n="169"/>
  <p>"But, shocking as it is, it is better for her," went on
          the countess; "for, poor creature, what could her
          future life have been!"</p>
  <p>"Oh, don't say it!" impetuously broke out the young
          viscount. "Killed in a railway accident, and for you
          to say that it is better for her!"</p>
  <p>"So it is better," said the countess. "Don't go into
          heroics, William. You are quite old enough to know
          that she had brought misery upon herself, and
          disgrace upon all connected with her. No one could
          ever have taken notice of her again."</p>
  <p>"I would," said the boy, stoutly.</p>
  <p>Lady Mount Severn smiled derisively.</p>
  <p>"I would. I never liked anybody in the world half so much
          as I liked Isabel."</p>
  <p>"That's past and gone. You could not have continued to
          like her, after the disgrace she wrought."</p>
  <p>"Somebody else wrought more of the disgrace than she did;
          and, had I been a man, I would have shot him dead,"
          flashed the viscount.</p>
  <p>"You don't know anything about it."</p>
  <p>"Don't I," he returned, not over dutifully. But Lady
          Mount Severn had not brought him up to be
          dutiful.</p>
  <p>"May I read the letter, mamma?" he demanded, after a
          pause.</p>
  <p>"If you can read it," she replied, tossing it to him.
          "She dictated it when she was dying."</p>
  <p>Lord Vane took the letter to a window and stayed looking
          over it for some time; the countess eat an egg and a
          plate of ham meanwhile. Presently he came back with
          it folded, and laid it on the table.</p>
  <p>"You will forward it to papa to-day?" he observed.</p>
  <pb n="170"/>
  <p>"I shall forward it to him. But there's no hurry; and I
          don't exactly know where your papa may be. I shall
          send the notice of her death to the papers; and am
          glad to do it: it is a blight removed from the
          family."</p>
  <p>"Mamma, I do think you are the unkindest woman that ever
          breathed!"</p>
  <p>"I'll give you something to call me unkind for, if you
          don't mind," retorted the countess, her colour
          rising. "Dock you of your holiday, and pack you back
          to school to-day."</p>
  <p>A few mornings after this, Mr. Carlyle left East Lynne,
          and proceeded to his office as usual. Scarcely was
          he seated, when Mr. Dill entered, and Mr. Carlyle
          looked at him inquiringly, for it was not Mr.
          Carlyle's custom to be intruded upon by any person
          until he had opened his letters: then he would ring
          for Mr. Dill. The letters and the <hi>Times</hi>
          newspapers lay on his table before him. The old
          gentleman came up in a covert, timid sort of way,
          which made Mr. Carlyle look all the more.</p>
  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir; will you let me ask if you have
          heard any particular news?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I have heard it," replied Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Then, sir, I beg your pardon a thousand times over. It
          occurred to me that you probably had not, Mr.
          Archibald; and I thought I would have said a word to
          prepare you, before you came upon it suddenly in the
          paper."</p>
  <p>"To prepare me!" echoed Mr. Carlyle, as old Dill was
          turning away. "Why, what has come to you, Dill? Are
          you afraid my nerves are growing delicate, or that I
          shall faint over the loss of a hundred pounds? At
          the very most, we shall not suffer above that
          extent."</p>
  <pb n="171"/>
  <p>Old Dill turned back again. "If I don't believe you are
          speaking of the failure of Kent and Green! It's not
            <hi>that</hi> , Mr. Archibald. They won't affect
          us much: and there'll be a dividend, report
          runs."</p>
  <p>"What is it, then?"</p>
  <p>"Then you have not heard it, sir! I am glad that I'm in
          time. It might not be well for you to have seen it
          without a word of preparation, Mr. Archibald."</p>
  <p>"If you have not gone demented, you will tell me what you
          mean, Dill, and leave me to my letters," cried Mr.
          Carlyle, wondering excessively at his sober,
          matter-of-fact clerk's words and manner.</p>
  <p>Old Dill laid his hand upon the <hi>Times</hi> newspaper.
          "It's here, Mr. Archibald, in the column of the
          deaths: the first on the list. Please prepare
          yourself a little, before you look at it."</p>
  <p>He shuffled out quickly, and Mr. Carlyle as quickly
          unfolded the paper. It was, as old Dill said, the
          first on the list of deaths.</p>
  <p>"At Cammère, in France, on the 18th inst., Isabel Mary,
          only child of William, late Earl of Mount
          Severn."</p>
  <p>Clients called; Mr. Carlyle's bell did not ring; an hour
          or two passed, and old Dill protested that Mr.
          Carlyle was engaged, until he could protest no
          longer. He went in deprecatingly. Mr. Carlyle sat
          yet with the newspaper before him, and the letters
          unopened at his elbow.</p>
  <p>"There's one or two who <hi>will</hi> come in, Mr.
          Archibald, who <hi>will</hi> see you: what am I to
          say?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stared at him for a moment, as if his wits
          had been in the next world. Then he swept the
          newspaper from before him, and was the calm,
          collected man of business again.</p>
  <pb n="172"/>
  <p>As the news of Lady Isabel's marriage had first come to
          the knowledge of Lord Mount Severn through the
          newspapers, so, singular to say, did the tidings of
          her death. The next post brought him the letter,
          which his wife had tardily forwarded. But, unlike
          Lady Mount Severn, he did not take her death so
          entirely upon trust: he knew what mistakes are often
          made in these reports from a distance, and he deemed
          it incumbent on him to make inquiries. He wrote
          immediately to the authorities of the town (in the
          best French he could muster) asking for particulars,
          and whether she was really dead.</p>
  <p>He received, in due course, a satisfactory answer;
          satisfactory in so far as that it set his doubts
          entirely at rest. He had inquired after her by her
          proper name and title, "La Dame Isabelle Vane," and
          as the authorities could find none of the survivors
          owning that name, they took it for granted she was
          dead. They wrote him word that the child and nurse
          whom he mentioned were killed on the spot; two
          ladies, who had occupied the same compartment of the
          carriage, had since died, one of whom was no doubt
          the mother, the lady he inquired for. She was dead
          and buried, sufficient money having been found upon
          her person to defray the few necessary expenses. It
          will easily be comprehended that the lady of whom
          they spoke was one of those who had been in the same
          carriage as Lady Isabel, and who had died.</p>
  <p>Thus, through no intention of Lady Isabel, news of her
          death went forth to Lord Mount Severn and to the
          world. <hi>Her</hi> first intimation that she was
          regarded as dead, was through a copy of that very
          day's <hi>Times</hi> seen by Mr. Carlyle, seen by
          Lord Mount Severn. An English traveller, who had
          been amongst the sufferers, <pb n="173"/> and lay in
          the hospital, received the English newspapers, and
          sometimes lent them her to read. She was not
          travelling under her own name; she left that behind
          her when she left Grenoble; she had rendered her own
          too notorious to risk the chance recognition of
          travellers: and the authorities did not suspect that
          the quiet, unobtrusive Madame Vine, slowly
          recovering at the hospital, was the Dame Isabelle
          Vane, respecting whom the grand English Comte
          wrote.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel understood it at once; that the despatching
          her letter had been the foundation of the
          misapprehension: and she began to ask herself now,
          why she should undeceive Lord Mount Severn and the
          world. She longed, none knew with what intense
          longing, to be unknown, obscure, totally
          unrecognised by all: none can know it, till they
          have put a barrier between themselves and the world,
          as she had done. She had no longer the child to
          support, she had only herself; and surely she could
          with ease earn enough for that: or she could starve:
          it mattered little which. No, there was no necessity
          for her continuing to accept the bounty of Lord
          Mount Severn, and she would let him and everybody
          else continue to believe she was dead, and be
          henceforth only Madame Vine. A resolution she
          adhered to.</p>
  <p>Thus the unhappy Lady Isabel's career was looked upon as
          run. Lord Mount Severn forwarded her letter to Mr.
          Carlyle, with the confirmation of her death, which
          he had obtained from the French authorities. It was
          a nine days' wonder: "That poor, erring Lady Isabel
          was dead"—people did not call her names in the very
          teeth of her fate—and then it was over.</p>
  <p>It was over. Lady Isabel Vane was as one forgotten.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XV. AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR AT EAST
          LYNNE.</head>
  <p><hi>There</hi> went, sailing up the avenue to East Lynne,
          a lady, one windy afternoon. If not a lady, she was
          attired as one: a flounced dress, and a stylish
          looking shawl, and a white veil. A very pretty
          woman, tall and slender, was she, and she minced as
          she walked, and coquetted with her head, and,
          altogether, contrived to show that she had quite as
          much vanity as brains. She went boldly up to the
          front entrance of the house, and boldly rang at it,
          drawing her white veil over her face as she did
          so.</p>
  <p>One of the men-servants answered it, not Peter; and,
          seeing somebody very smart before him, bowed
          deferentially.</p>
  <p>"Miss Hallijohn is residing here, I believe. Is she
          within?"</p>
  <p>"Who, ma'am?"</p>
  <p>"Miss Hallijohn; Miss Joyce Hallijohn," somewhat sharply
          repeated the lady, as if impatient of any delay. "I
          wish to see her."</p>
  <p>The man was rather taken aback. He had deemed it a
          visitor to the house, and was prepared to usher her
          to the drawing-room, at least; but it seemed it was
          only a visitor to Joyce. He showed her into a small
          parlour, <pb n="175"/> and went up-stairs to the
          nursery, where Joyce was sitting with Wilson—for
          there had been no change in the domestic department
          of East Lynne. Joyce remained as upper maid,
          partially superintending the servants, attending
          upon Lucy, and making Miss Carlyle's dresses as
          usual. Wilson was nurse still. Miss Carlyle had once
          or twice begun upon the point of the extravagance of
          keeping both Wilson and Joyce; but Mr. Carlyle had
          wholly declined discussion upon the subject; and
          somehow Miss Carlyle did not find him bend to her
          will as he once had done.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Joyce, there's a lady asking for you," said the
          man. "I have shown her into the grey parlour."</p>
  <p>"A lady for me?" repeated Joyce. "Who is it? Some one to
          see the children, perhaps?"</p>
  <p>"It's for yourself, I think. She asked for Miss
          Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>Joyce looked at the man; but she put down her work and
          proceeded to the grey parlour. A pretty woman, vain
          and dashing, threw up her white veil at her
          entrance.</p>
  <p>"Well, Joyce! How are you?"</p>
  <p>Joyce, always pale, turned paler still, as she gazed in
          blank consternation. Was it really <hi>Afy</hi> who
          stood before her?—Afy the erring.</p>
  <p>Afy it was. And she stood there, holding out her hand to
          Joyce with, what Wilson would have called, all the
          brass in the world. Joyce could not reconcile her
          mind to link her own with it.</p>
  <p>"Excuse me, Afy, but I cannot take your hand. I cannot
          welcome you here. What could have induced you to
          come?"</p>
  <p>"If you are going to be upon the high ropes, it seems <pb n="176"/> I might as well have stayed away," was
          Afy's reply, given in the pert, but good-humoured
          manner she had ever used to Joyce. "My hand won't
          damage yours. I am not poison."</p>
  <p>"You are looked upon in the neighbourhood as worse than
          poison, Afy," returned Joyce, in a tone, not of
          anger but of sorrow. "Where's Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>Afy tossed her head. "Where's who?" asked she.</p>
  <p>"Richard Hare. My question was plain enough."</p>
  <p>"How should I know where he is? It's like your impudence
          to mention him to me. Why don't you ask me where Old
          Nick is, and how he does? I'd rather own
          acquaintance with him, than with Richard Hare, if
          I'd only my choice between the two."</p>
  <p>"Then you have left Richard Hare! How long since?"</p>
  <p>"I have left—what do you say?" broke off Afy, whose lips
          were quivering ominously with suppressed passion.
          "Perhaps you'll condescend to explain. I don't
          understand."</p>
  <p>"When you left here, Afy, did you not go after Richard
          Hare?—did you not join him?"</p>
  <p>"I'll tell you what it is, Joyce," flashed Afy, her face
          indignant and her voice passionate, "I have put up
          with some things from you in my time, but human
          nature has its limits of endurance, and I won't bear
            <hi>that</hi> . I have never set eyes on Richard
          Hare since that night of horror. I wish I could: I'd
          help to hang him."</p>
  <p>Joyce paused. The belief that Afy was with him had been
          long and deeply imbued within her; it was the
          long-continued and firm conviction of all West
          Lynne: and a settled belief, such as that, is not
          easily shaken. Was Afy telling her the truth? She
          knew her propensity <pb n="177"/> for making false
          statements, when they served to excuse herself.</p>
  <p>"Afy," she said at length, "let me understand you. When
          you left this place, was it not to share Richard
          Hare's flight? Have you not been living with
          him?"</p>
  <p>"No!" burst forth Afy, with kindling eyes. "Living with
            <hi>him!</hi> with our father's murderer! Shame
          upon you, Joyce Hallijohn! you must be precious
          wicked yourself to suppose it."</p>
  <p>"If I have judged you wrongly, Afy, I sincerely beg your
          pardon. Not only myself, but the whole of West Lynne
          believed you were with him; and the thought has
          caused me pain night and day."</p>
  <p>"What a cannibal-minded set you must all be, then!" was
          Afy's indignant rejoinder.</p>
  <p>"Not one in the place but thought so, with the exception
          of Mr. Carlyle," proceeded Joyce. "He has said two
          or three times to me that he should not think you
          went to Richard Hare, or were living with him."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle has more sense than all the rest of West
          Lynne put together," complacently observed Afy.
          "Living with Richard Hare! why, I'd rather go and
          live with a scalped red Indian who goes about with
          his body tattooed in place of clothes, and keeps
          sixteen wives."</p>
  <p>"But, Afy, where did you go, then? Why did you leave at
          all?"</p>
  <p>"Never mind why. It was not to be supposed that I could
          stop at home in the cottage, with ghosts and dreams
          and all those sort of things, that attend a place
          where murder has been."</p>
  <p>"What have you been doing ever since? Where have you
          been?"</p>
  <p>"Never mind, I say," repeated Afy. "West Lynne <pb n="178"/> has not been so complimentary to me, it
          appears, that I need put myself out of my way to
          satisfy its curiosity. I was knocking about a bit at
          first, but I soon settled down as steady as Old
          Time; as steady as you."</p>
  <p>"Are you married?" inquired Joyce, noting the word
          "settled."</p>
  <p>"Catch me marrying," retorted Afy; "I like my liberty too
          well. Not but what I might be induced to change my
          condition, if anything out of the way eligible
          occurred: it must be very eligible, though, to tempt
          me. I am what I suppose you call yourself—a lady's
          maid."</p>
  <p>"Indeed!" said Joyce, much relieved. "And are you
          confortable, Afy?—are you in a good service?"</p>
  <p>"Middling for that. The pay's not amiss, but there's a
          great deal to do, and her ladyship's a Tartar. I had
          a good one with an old lady; a sort of companion I
          was to her, and stopped there till she died. What do
          you think? She made me go in to prayers with her,
          and read the Bible night and morning."</p>
  <p>"How very glad I am to hear this!" exclaimed Joyce. "It
          must have been so good for you."</p>
  <p>"Very," assented Afy; and Joyce failed to detect the
          irony of her tone. "She'd used to read a chapter,
          and I'd used to read a chapter, and then we went to
          prayers. Edifying, wasn't it?"</p>
  <p>"Delightfully so, Afy. I am sure you must have profited
          by it."</p>
  <p>"Law, yes: never doubt that. She left me thirty pounds
          when she died, over and above my salary. I used to
          like the Psalms best, because they were short and
          comforting."</p>
  <p>"So comforting!" echoed Joyce. "Afy, I shall <pb n="179"/> love you and be proud of you again, like I was
          when you first came home to us."</p>
  <p>Afy laughed, a ringing laugh. "You and West Lynne always
          set me down for worse than I was. Though it poses me
          to imagine what on earth could have induced you to
          fancy I should go off with that Dick Hare," she
          added, for she could not forget the grievance.</p>
  <p>"Look at the circumstances," argued Joyce. "You both
          disappeared."</p>
  <p>"But not together!"</p>
  <p>"Nearly together. There were only a few days intervening.
          And you had neither money nor friends."</p>
  <p>"You don't know what I had. But I would rather have died
          of want on my father's grave, than have shared his
          means," continued Afy, growing passionate again.
          "And you and the West Lynne idiots ought to have
          made sure of that."</p>
  <p>"If you had but dropped me a single line, Afy! it would
          have put a different aspect upon the whole affair.
          Your silence helped to misjudge you."</p>
  <p>"Misjudge me, indeed! Why, I never cared for Dick Hare.
          He was only half baked."</p>
  <p>"You encouraged him to the house."</p>
  <p>"Well—I don't deny it. He used to speak to me of
          marriage: and one would put up with a man not baked
          at all, to be made a real lady. Had I known he was
          to turn out what he did, I would have seen his
          coffin walk, before I'd ever have spoken to him.
          Where is he? Not hung, or I should have heard of
          it."</p>
  <p>"He has never been seen since that night, Afy."</p>
  <p>"Nor heard of?"</p>
  <pb n="180"/>
  <p>"Nor heard of. Most people think he is in Australia, or
          some other foreign land."</p>
  <p>"The best place for him: the more distance he puts
          between him and home, the better. If he ever does
          come back, I hope he'll get his deserts—which is a
          rope's end. I'd go to his hanging."</p>
  <p>"You are as bitter against him as Mr. Justice Hare. he
          would bring his son back to suffer, if he
          could."</p>
  <p>"A cross-grained old camel!" remarked Afy, in allusion to
          the qualities, social and amiable, of the revered
          justice. "I don't defend Dick Hare, I hate him too
          much for that, but if his father had treated him
          differently, Dick might have been different. Well,
          let's talk of something else; the subject invariably
          gives me the shivers. Who is mistress here?"</p>
  <p>"Miss Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Oh. I might have guessed that. Is she as fierce as
          ever?"</p>
  <p>"There is little alteration in her."</p>
  <p>"And there won't be on this side the grave. I say, Joyce,
          I don't want to encounter her: she might set on at
          me, like she has done many a time in the old days.
          Little love was there lost between me and Corny
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"You need not fear meeting her. She is away: gone to
          Lynneborough for a week's visit."</p>
  <p>"That's good news for a rainy day! Then, who acts as
          mistress while she's absent?"</p>
  <p>"I give the orders," said Joyce. "Master interferes very
          little."</p>
  <p>"Will he marry again?" went on Afy.</p>
  <p>"How can I tell? There appears no probability of it at
          present. A few weeks or months ago, a rumour <pb n="181"/> arose that he was to marry Miss Louisa
          Dobede; but it died away again."</p>
  <p>"Louisa Dobede! one of that ugly old baronet's
          daughters?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. But Sir John Dobede is not ugly."</p>
  <p>"Not ugly! Why, he has got a nose as long as a foundry
          chimney. Well, one would think Mr. Carlyle had had
          enough of marrying."</p>
  <p>"Lady Isabel is dead," interrupted Joyce, hastily.</p>
  <p>"So is Queen Anne. What's the good of telling me news
          that all the world knows?"</p>
  <p>"I reminded you that she was dead that you might not
          speak against her," said Joyce. "Whatever may have
          been Lady Isabel's failings, they are buried in her
          grave."</p>
  <p>"Buried or not, their remembrance lasts," cried Afy, "and
          you may as well try to stop the sun's shining, as to
          stop folks giving their opinions. East Lynne must
          have been well rid of her—such a canker as
          that!"</p>
  <p>Joyce put up her hand. "Afy, be silent! You have no right
          so to speak of Lady Isabel: you know nothing of the
          facts."</p>
  <p>"I know all the facts by heart," imperturbably rejoined
          Afy. "You may take your oath they were conned over
          and over by us at Lady Mount Severn's."</p>
  <p>Joyce looked at her in surprise. "What have you to do
          with Lady Mount Severn's?"</p>
  <p>"Well, that's good! It's where I am in service."</p>
  <p>"At Lady Mount Severn's?"</p>
  <p>"Why not? I have been there two years. It is not a great
          deal longer I shall stop, though; she has got too
          much vinegar in her for me. It happened <pb n="182"/> just after I went there, and she had a cousin
          visiting her, a Miss Levison, and the two were for
          ever talking of it."</p>
  <p>"But not in your presence?"</p>
  <p>"I heard," significantly nodded Afy. "Heard just as much
          as they had to tell."</p>
  <p>"You must have listened at keyholes."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps I did," was Afy's cool response. "I had a fancy
          to hear the particulars; and when I do make up my
          mind to know a thing, I don't let trifles stand in
          my way. Tell me about her, Joyce."</p>
  <p>Joyce shook her head. "There's nothing much to tell. She
          was one of the sweetest ladies, one of the kindest
          mistresses—"</p>
  <p>"Oh, I see," interrupted Afy, with ineffable disdain.
          "She was one of your angels."</p>
  <p>"Almost, she was. Until that serpent came here to cross
          her path."</p>
  <p>"Manners! manners!" laughed Afy. "It's not polite to call
          names."</p>
  <p>"I could call him names for ever," warmly answered Joyce.
          "And so I would, if it could bring him punishment.
          It will come home to him: mark my words."</p>
  <p>"Lady Mount Severn throws all the blame on her."</p>
  <p>"It is more than Lord Mount Severn does," angrily
          returned Joyce.</p>
  <p>"I could have told you that. He casts some share of it to
          Lady Mount Severn. Sir Francis is her cousin, you
          know. Was she good-looking, Joyce?"</p>
  <p>"Beautiful."</p>
  <p>"Better looking than I am?" cried vain Afy, glancing at
          herself in an opposite mirror.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Afy! how absurd you are!"</p>
  <pb n="183"/>
  <p>"Many thanks. Because she was the Lady Isabel, and I am
          plain Afy Hallijohn, of course I can't be compared
          to her! Everybody thinks they may lance shafts at my
          back: but lady angels go wrong sometimes, you see;
          they are not universally immaculate. She must have
          been a queer angel, rather, to leave her
          children."</p>
  <p>"Afy, do you understand that this conversation is
          particularly disagreeable to me?" cried Joyce with
          spirit.</p>
  <p>"It's a very disagreeable topic indeed, I should say,"
          equably replied Afy. "She should not have acted so
          as to give rise to it. He soon tired of her, with
          all her beauty: he has tired—as it is said—of
          others. He is married now."</p>
  <p>"Yes," indignantly spoke Joyce, "and the wonder is, how
          any young lady, with a spark of delicacy or good
          feeling, could bring herself to marry so notorious a
          man."</p>
  <p>"Ladies don't dislike that sort of notoriety," said Afy,
          laughing at Joyce's reproving face. "That is, when
          the offenders are handsome, as he is."</p>
  <p>"You have seen him at Lady Mount Severn's?"</p>
  <p>"Not I. I have seen him, but not there. Since the Carlyle
          affair, he dare not show his face within their
          doors: my lord would kick him out. What an awful
          thing that railway accident must have been!"</p>
  <p>Joyce shuddered. "Ay, it was an awful death."</p>
  <p>"And quite a judgment upon her, I should say," went on
          Afy, probably seeing that the style of conversation
          aggravated Joyce.</p>
  <p>Joyce would stand it no longer. "Listen, Afy: I loved my
          mistress, and I love her memory still, in spite of
          what has taken place. If you are to speak <pb n="184"/> against her, it must be in some other
          house, for it shall not be in Mr. Carlyle's, where
          she was once so honoured."</p>
  <p>"Have it your own way," indifferently rejoined Afy.
          "She's gone to kingdom come, so it's not worth while
          disputing over it. Is Mr. Carlyle at home?"</p>
  <p>"He will be home to dinner. I dare say you would like
          some tea: you shall come and take it with me and
          Wilson in the nursery."</p>
  <p>"I was thinking you might have the grace to offer me
          something," cried Afy. "I intend to stop till
          to-morrow in the neighbourhood: my lady gave me two
          days' holiday—for she was going to see her dreadful
          old grandmother, where she can't take a maid—and I
          thought I'd use it in coming to have a look at the
          old place again. Don't stare at me in that blank
          way, as if you feared I should ask the grand loan of
          sleeping here. I shall sleep at the Mount Severn
          Arms."</p>
  <p>"I was not glancing at such a thought, Afy. Come and take
          your bonnet off."</p>
  <p>"Is the nursery full of children?"</p>
  <p>"There's only one child in it. Miss Lucy and Master
          William are with the governess."</p>
  <p>Wilson received Afy with lofty condescension, having
          Richard Hare in her thoughts. But Joyce explained
          that it was all a misapprehension—that her sister
          had not been near Richard Hare, but was as indignant
          against him as they were. Upon which Wilson grew
          cordial and chatty, rejoicing in the delightful
          recreation her tongue would enjoy that evening.</p>
  <p>Afy's account of herself, as to past proceedings, was
          certainly not the most satisfactory in the world,
          but altogether, taking in the present, it was so
          vast an <pb n="185"/> improvement upon Joyce's
          conclusions, that she had not felt so elated for
          many a day. When Mr. Carlyle returned home Joyce
          sought him, and acquainted him with what had
          happened; that Afy was come: was maid to Lady Mount
          Severn; and, above all, that she had never been with
          Richard Hare.</p>
  <p>"Ah! you remember what I said, Joyce," he remarked. "That
          I did not believe Afy was with Richard Hare."</p>
  <p>"I have been telling Afy so, sir, and she says you have
          got more sense than all West Lynne put
          together."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed.</p>
  <p>"A terrible way she was in, to be sure, when I informed
          her what people had believed," continued Joyce. "She
          nearly went into one of her old passions."</p>
  <p>"Does she seem steady, Joyce?"</p>
  <p>"I think so, sir—steady for her. Before she took Lady
          Mount Severn's service, she was with an old lady,
          where she read her Bible and joined in prayers night
          and morning."</p>
  <p>"Afy at prayers!" exclaimed Mr. Carlyle, a smile crossing
          his lips. "I hope they were genuine."</p>
  <p>"I was thinking, sir, that as she appears to have turned
          out so respectable, and is with Lady Mount Severn,
          you perhaps might see no objection to her sleeping
          here for to-night. It would be better than for her
          to go to an inn, as she talks of doing."</p>
  <p>"None at all," replied Mr. Carlyle. "Let her remain."</p>
  <p>As Joyce returned to the nursery, Afy and Wilson were in
          the full flowing tide of talk, trying whose tongue
            <pb n="186"/> could go the fastest. An unlucky
          sentence of Afy's caught Joyce's ears.</p>
  <p>"It's as true as you are there, Wilson. She bothered me
          all day long with her religion. I had used to pick
          out the shortest psalm I could find, and when she
          asked me why, I said I did it that I might remember
          them. There's one with two verses in it; I chose
          that as often as I dared. And then, down I had to go
          on my marrow-bones, and put up my hands! I had used
          to wish my mistress and her prayers somewhere."</p>
  <p>Joyce groaned in spirit, and thought of the words just
          spoken by Mr. Carlyle—he had hoped the prayers were
          genuine!</p>
  <p>Later in the evening, after Mr. Carlyle's dinner, a
          message came that Afy was to go to him. Accordingly
          she proceeded to his presence.</p>
  <p>"So Afy! you have returned to let West Lynne know that
          you are alive. Sit down."</p>
  <p>"West Lynne may go a walking in future, sir, for all the
          heed I shall take of it," retorted Afy. "A set of
          wicked-minded scandal-mongers, to take and say I had
          gone off after Richard Hare!"</p>
  <p>"You should not have gone off at all, Afy."</p>
  <p>"Well, sir, that was my business, and I chose to go. I
          could not stop in the cottage after that night's
          work."</p>
  <p>"There is a mystery attaching to that night's work, Afy,"
          observed Mr. Carlyle; "a mystery that I cannot
          fathom. Perhaps you can help me out."</p>
  <p>"What mystery, sir?" returned Afy.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle leaned forward, his arms on the table; Afy
          had taken a chair at the other end of it. "Who <pb n="187"/> was it that committed the murder?" he
          demanded, in a grave and somewhat imperative
          tone.</p>
  <p>Afy stared some moments before she replied, evidently
          astonished at the question. "Who committed the
          murder, sir?" she uttered at length. "Richard Hare
          committed it. Everybody knows that."</p>
  <p>"Did you see it done?"</p>
  <p>"No," replied Afy. "If I had seen it, the fright and
          horror would have killed me. Richard Hare quarrelled
          with my father, and drew the gun upon him in his
          passion."</p>
  <p>"You assume this to have been the case, Afy; as others
          have assumed it. I do not think it was Richard Hare
          who killed your father."</p>
  <p>"Not Richard Hare!" exclaimed Afy, after a pause. "Then
          who do you think did it, sir? I?"</p>
  <p>"Nonsense, Afy."</p>
  <p>"I know he did it," proceeded Afy. "It is true that I did
          not see it done, but I know it, for all that. I
            <hi>know</hi> it, sir."</p>
  <p>"You cannot know it, Afy."</p>
  <p>"I do know it, sir; I would not assert it to you if I did
          not. If Richard Hare were here present before us,
          and swore till he was black in the face that it was
          not he, I could convict him."</p>
  <p>"By what means?"</p>
  <p>"I had rather not say, sir. But you may believe me, for I
          am speaking truth."</p>
  <p>"There was another friend of yours present that evening,
          Afy. Lieutenant Thorn."</p>
  <p>Afy's face turned crimson: she was evidently confused.
          But Mr. Carlyle's speech and manner were <pb n="188"/> authoritative, and she saw that it would be
          useless to attempt to trifle with him.</p>
  <p>"I know he was, sir. A young chap, who used to ride over
          some evenings to see me. He had nothing to do with
          what occurred."</p>
  <p>"Where did he ride from?"</p>
  <p>"He was stopping with some friends at Swainson. He was
          nobody, sir."</p>
  <p>"What was his name?" questioned Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Thorn," said Afy.</p>
  <p>"I mean his real name. Thorn was an assumed one."</p>
  <p>"Oh dear no," returned Afy. "Thorn was his name."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle paused and looked at her.</p>
  <p>"Afy, I have reason to believe that Thorn was only an
          assumed name. Now, I have a motive for wishing to
          know his real one, and you would very much oblige me
          by confiding it to me. What was it?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know that he had any other name, sir; I am sure
          he had no other," persisted Afy. "He was Lieutenant
          Thorn then, and he was Captain Thorn
          afterwards."</p>
  <p>"You have seen him since?"</p>
  <p>"Once in a way we have met."</p>
  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>
  <p>"Now! Oh, my goodness, I don't know anything about him
          now!" said Afy. "I have not heard of him or seen him
          for a long while. I think I heard something about
          his going to India with his regiment."</p>
  <p>"What regiment is he in?"</p>
  <p>"I'm sure I don't know about that," said Afy. "Is <pb n="189"/> not one regiment the same as another:
          they are all in the army, aren't they, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Afy, I must find this Captain Thorn. Do you know
          anything of his family?"</p>
  <p>Afy shook her head. "I don't think he had any. I never
          heard him mention so much as a brother or a
          sister."</p>
  <p>"And you persist in saying his name was Thorn!"</p>
  <p>"I persist in it because it was his name. I am positive
          it was his name."</p>
  <p>"Afy, shall I tell you why I want to find him? I believe
          that it was he who murdered your father: not Richard
          Hare."</p>
  <p>Afy's mouth and eyes gradually opened, and her face
          turned hot and cold alternately. Then passion
          mastered her, and she burst forth.</p>
  <p>"It's a lie! I beg your pardon, sir, but whoever told you
          that, told you a lie. Thorn had no more to do with
          it than I had; I'll swear it."</p>
  <p>"I tell you, Afy, I believe Thorn to have been the man.
          You were not present: you cannot know who actually
          did it."</p>
  <p>"Yes I can, and do know," said Afy, bursting into tears
          of hysterical passion. "Thorn was with me when it
          happened, so it could not have been Thorn. It was
          that wicked Richard Hare. Sir! have I not said that
          I'll swear it?"</p>
  <p>"Thorn was with you!—at the moment of the murder?"
          repeated Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Yes he was," shrieked Afy, nearly beside herself with
          emotion. "Whoever has been trying to put it off
          Richard Hare, and on to him, is a wicked,
          false-hearted <pb n="190"/> wretch. It was Richard
          Hare and nobody else, and I hope he'll be hung for
          it yet."</p>
  <p>"You are telling me truth, Afy?" gravely spoke Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Truth!" echoed Afy, flinging up her hands. "Would I tell
          a lie over my poor father's death? If Thorn had done
          it, would I screen him, or shuffle it off to Richard
          Hare? No, no."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt uncertain and bewildered. That Afy was
          sincere in what she said was but too apparent. He
          spoke again, but Afy had risen from her chair to
          leave.</p>
  <p>"Locksley was in the wood that evening; Otway Bethel was
          in it. Could either of them have been the
          culprit?"</p>
  <p>"No, sir," firmly retorted Afy, "the culprit was Richard
          Hare; and I'd say it with my latest breath. I'd say
          it because I know it—though I don't choose to say
          how I know it; time enough when he gets taken."</p>
  <p>She quitted the room, leaving Mr. Carlyle in a state of
          puzzled bewilderment. Was he to believe Afy? or was
          he to believe the bygone assertion of Richard
          Hare?</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVI. A NIGHT INVASION OF EAST LYNNE.</head>
  <p><hi>In</hi> one of the comfortable sitting-rooms of East
          Lynne sat Mr. Carlyle and his sister one inclement
          January night. The contrast within and without was
          great. The warm, blazing fire, the handsome carpet
          on which it flickered, the exceedingly comfortable
          arrangement of the furniture, of the room
          altogether, and the light of the chandelier which
          fell on all, presented a picture of home peace,
          though it may not have deserved the name of luxury.
          Without, heavy flakes of snow were falling thickly,
          flakes as large and nearly as heavy as a crown
          piece, rendering the atmosphere so dense and
          obscure, that a man could not see a yard before him.
          Mr. Carlyle had driven home in the pony carriage,
          and the snow had so settled upon him, even in that
          short journey, that Lucy, who happened to see him as
          he entered the hall, screamed out laughingly that
          her papa had turned into a white man. It was now
          later in the evening; the children were in bed, the
          governess was in her own sitting-room—it was not
          often that Miss Carlyle invited her to theirs in an
          evening—and the house was quiet. Mr. Carlyle was
          deep in the pages of one of the monthly periodicals;
            <pb n="192"/> and Miss Carlyle sat on the other
          side the fire, grumbling, and grunting, and
          sniffing, and choking.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle was one of your strong-minded ladies, who
          never condescend to be ill. Of course, had she been
          attacked with scarlet fever, or paralysis, or St.
          Vitus's dance, she must have given in to the enemy;
          but trifling ailments, such as headache, influenza,
          sorethroat, which other people get, passed her by.
          Imagine, therefore, her exasperation at finding her
          head stuffed up, her chest sore, and her voice
          going: in short, at having, for once in her life,
          caught a cold like ordinary mortals.</p>
  <p>"It was that ale," she groaned.</p>
  <p>"Ale!" echoed Mr. Carlyle, lifting his eyes from his
          book.</p>
  <p>"Yes, the ale," she tartly proceeded. "Dear me,
          Archibald, you need not stare as if I had said it
          was the moon gave it me."</p>
  <p>"But how could ale give it you? Unless you drank a great
          draught of it cold, when you were in a
          perspiration."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle lifted her hands in pitying contempt for his
          ignorance.</p>
  <p>"You'll be a baby in common sense to the end of your
          life, Archibald. When do I drink great draughts of
          ale? Pray, the last two barrels that we have had in
          tap, has there not been, throughout, a complaint
          that the taps leaked?"</p>
  <p>"Well?" said he.</p>
  <p>"Well, I knew that the fault lay in the putting in the
          taps in the first instance, servants are such
          incapables; so, when Peter came to me after
          breakfast this morning and said there had better be
          another <pb n="193"/> barrel of ale tapped, for that
          the one in hand was stooped yesterday, 'Very well,'
          said I, 'I'll come and see to it myself.' And down I
          went, out of these warm rooms, and the cellar struck
          like an ice-house, and I stopped in it for twenty
          minutes, good."</p>
  <p>"Does it take all that time to tap a barrel of ale?"</p>
  <p>"No, it doesn't take it when things are in order, but it
          does when you have to bother over the taps,
          rejecting one, rejecting another," responded Miss
          Carlyle, in a tone of exasperation. "And a pretty
          state that cellar was in! not a thing in place. I
          had the cook down, and a sharp dressing I gave her:
          if her hams had been turned for three days, I'll eat
          them, raw as they are! That's how I must have caught
          this cold, stopping down there."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle made no observation: had he told her that
          there was no need whatever for her interference,
          that Peter was perfectly competent to his duties,
          she would only have flown at him. He became absorbed
          in his book again, while Miss Carlyle fretted and
          grunted, and drew her chair into the fire and pushed
          it back again, and made violent starts with her
          hands and feet: in short, performed all the antics
          of a middle-aged gentlewoman suffering under an
          attack of fidgets.</p>
  <p>"What's the time, I wonder?" she exclaimed,
          by-and-by.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle looked at his watch. "It is just nine,
          Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"Then I think I shall go to bed. I'll have a basin of
          arrowroot or gruel, or some slop of that sort, after
          I'm in it: I'm sure I have been free enough all my
          life from requiring such sick dishes!"</p>
  <p>"Do so," said Mr. Carlyle. "It may do you good."</p>
  <pb n="194"/>
  <p>"There's one thing excellent for a cold in the head, I
          know. It's to double your flannel petticoat
          crossways, or any other large piece of flannel you
          may conveniently have at hand, and put it on over
          your night-cap: I'll try it."</p>
  <p>"I would," said Mr. Carlyle, smothering an irreverent
          laugh.</p>
  <p>She sat on five minutes longer, and then left, wishing
          Mr. Carlyle good night. He resumed his reading. But,
          another page or two concluded the article; upon
          which Mr. Carlyle threw the book on the table, rose,
          and stretched himself, as if tired of sitting.</p>
  <p>He stirred the fire into a brighter blaze, and stood on
          the hearth-rug. "I wonder if it snows still?" he
          exclaimed to himself.</p>
  <p>Proceeding to the window, one of those opening to the
          ground, he drew aside the half of the warm crimson
          curtain. It all looked dull and dark outside: Mr.
          Carlyle could see little what the weather was, and
          he opened the window and stepped half out.</p>
  <p>The snow was falling faster and thicker than ever. Not at
          that did Mr. Carlyle start with surprise, if not
          with a more unpleasant sensation; but, at feeling a
          man's hand touch his, and finding a man's face
          nearly in contact with his own.</p>
  <p>"Let me come in, Mr. Carlyle, for the love of life! I see
          you are alone. I'm dead beat: and I don't know but I
          am dodged also."</p>
  <p>The tones struck familiarly on Mr. Carlyle's ear. He drew
          back mechanically; a thousand perplexing sensations
          overwhelmed him; and the man followed him into the
          room. A white man, as Lucy had called her father.
          Ay, for he had been hours and hours on foot <pb n="195"/> in the snow: his hat, his clothes, his
          eyebrows, his large whiskers, all were white. "Lock
          the door, sir," were his first words. Need you be
          told that it was Richard Hare?</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle fastened the window, drew the heavy curtain
          across it, and turned rapidly to lock the two doors.
          For there were two to the room, one of them leading
          into the adjoining one. Richard, meanwhile, took off
          his wet smock-frock—the old smock-frock of former
          memory—his hat, and his false black whiskers, wiping
          the snow from the latter with his hand.</p>
  <p>"Richard," uttered Mr. Carlyle, "I am thunderstruck. I
          fear you have done wrong to come here."</p>
  <p>"I cut off from London at a moment's notice," replied
          Richard, who was literally shivering with the cold.
          "I'm dodged, Mr. Carlyle; I am indeed; the police
          are after me, set on by that wretch, Thorn."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle turned to the sideboard and poured out a wine
          glass of brandy. "Drink it, Richard: it will warm
          you."</p>
  <p>"I'd rather have it in some hot water, sir."</p>
  <p>"But how am I to get the hot water brought in? Drink this
          for now. Why, how you tremble!"</p>
  <p>"Ah. A few hours outside in that cold snow is enough to
          make the strongest man tremble, sir. And it lies so
          deep in some places that you have to come along at a
          snail's pace. But I'll tell you about this business.
          A fortnight ago, I was at a cab-stand at the
          West-end, talking to a cab-driver, when some drops
          of rain came down. A gentleman and lady were passing
          at the time, but I had not paid any attention to
          them. 'By Jove!' I heard him exclaim to her, 'I
          think we are going to have pepper. We had better <pb n="196"/> take a cab, my dear.' With that, the man
          I was talking to swung open the door of his cab, and
          she got in—such a fair young girl! I turned to look
          at him, and you might just have knocked me down with
          astonishment. Mr. Carlyle, it was the man,
          Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Indeed!"</p>
  <p>"You thought I might be mistaken in him that moonlight
          night; but there was no mistaking him in broad
          daylight. I looked him full in the face, and he
          looked me. He turned as white as a cloth: perhaps I
          did; I don't know."</p>
  <p>"Was he well dressed?"</p>
  <p>"Very. Oh, there's no mistaking his position. That he
          moves in the higher circles, there's no doubt. The
          cab drove away and I got up behind it. The driver
          thought boys were there, and turned his head and his
          whip, but I made him a sign. We didn't go much more
          than the length of a street. I was on the pavement
          before Thorn was, and looked at him again; and again
          he went white. I marked the house, thinking it was
          where he lived, and, and—"</p>
  <p>"Why did you not give him into custody, Richard?"</p>
  <p>Richard shook his head. "And my proofs of his guilt, Mr.
          Carlyle? I could bring none against him: no positive
          ones. No, I must wait till I can get proofs, to do
          that. He would turn round upon me now, and swear my
          life away, to render his secure: perhaps testify
          that he saw me commit the murder. Well, I thought
          I'd ascertain for certain what his name was, and
          that night I went to the house and got into
          conversation with one of the servants, who was
          standing at the door. 'Does Captain Thorn live
          here?' I asked him. 'Mr. Westleby lives here,' said
          he; 'I don't <pb n="197"/> know any Captain Thorn.'
          Then that's his name, thought I to myself. 'A
          youngish man, isn't he?' said I, 'very smart, with a
          pretty wife?' 'I don't know what you call youngish,'
          he laughed, 'my master's turned sixty, and his
          wife's as old.' That checked me. 'Perhaps he has
          sons?' I asked. 'Not any,' the man answered;
          'there's nobody but their two selves.' So, with
          that, I told him what I wanted— that a lady and
          gentleman had alighted there in a cab that day, and
          I wished to know his name. Well, Mr. Carlyle, I
          could get at nothing satisfactory; the fellow said a
          great many had called there that day, for his master
          was just up from a long illness, and people came to
          see him."</p>
  <p>"Is this all, Richard?"</p>
  <p>"All! I wish it had been all. I kept looking about for
          him in all the best streets: I was half mad—"</p>
  <p>"Do you not wonder, if he is in this position of life and
          resides in London, that you have never dropped upon
          him previously?" interrupted Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"No, sir: and I'll tell you why. I have been afraid to
          show myself in those better parts of the town,
          fearing I might meet with some I used to know at
          home, who would recognise me, so I have kept mostly
          in obscure places; stables, and such-like. I had
          gone up to the West-end this day on a matter of
          business."</p>
  <p>"Well, go on with your story."</p>
  <p>"In a week's time I came upon him again. It was at night.
          He was coming out of one of the theatres, and I went
          up and stood before him. 'What do you want, fellow?'
          he asked. 'I have seen you watching me before this.'
          'I want to know your name,' I said, 'that's enough
          for me at present.' He flew into a fierce <pb n="198"/> passion, and swore that if ever he
          caught sight of me near him again, he would hand me
          over into custody. 'And, remember, men are not given
          into custody for <hi>watching</hi> others,' he
          significantly added. 'I know you, and if you have
          any regard for yourself, you'll keep out of my way.'
          He got into a private carriage as he spoke, and it
          drove away: I could see that it had a great
          coat-of-arms upon it."</p>
  <p>"When do you say this happened?"</p>
  <p>"A week ago. Well, I could not rest; I was half mad, I
          say, and I went about still, trying if I could not
          discover his name and who he was. I did come upon
          him once: but he was walking quickly, arm-in-arm
          with—with another gentleman. Again I saw him,
          standing at the entrance to Tattersall's, talking to
          the same gentleman; and his face turned savage—I
          believe with fear as much as anger—when he saw me.
          He seemed to hesitate, and then—as if he acted in a
          passion—suddenly beckoned a policeman, pointed me
          out, and said something to him in a fast tone. That
          frightened me, and I slipped away. Two hours later,
          when I was in quite a different part of the town, in
          turning my head, I saw the same policeman following
          me. I bolted under the horses of a passing vehicle,
          cut into some turnings and passages, through into
          another street, and got up beside a cabman who was
          on his box, driving a fare past. I reached my
          lodgings in safety, as I thought: but, happening to
          glance into the street, there I saw the man again,
          standing opposite, and reconnoitring the house. I
          had gone home hungry, but this took all my hunger
          away from me. I opened the box where I keep my
          disguise, put it on, and got out by a back way. I
          have been pretty nearly ever since <pb n="199"/> on
          my feet coming here; I only got a lift now and
          then."</p>
  <p>"But, Richard, do you know that West Lynne is the very
          worst place you could have flown to? It has come to
          light that you were here before, disguised as a farm
          labourer."</p>
  <p>"Who the deuce betrayed that?" ejaculated Richard.</p>
  <p>"I am unable to tell; I cannot even imagine. The rumour
          was rife in the place, and it reached your father's
          ears. That rumour may make people's wits sharper to
          know you in your disguise, than they otherwise might
          have been."</p>
  <p>"But what was I to do? I was forced to come here first,
          to get a little money. I shall fix myself in some
          other big town, far away from London; Liverpool, or
          Manchester perhaps; and see what employment I can
          get into, but I must have something to live upon
          till I can get it. I don't possess a penny piece,"
          he added, drawing out his trousers-pockets for the
          inspection of Mr. Carlyle. "The last coppers I had,
          threepence, I spent in bread-and-cheese and half a
          pint of beer at mid-day. I have been outside that
          window for more than an hour, sir."</p>
  <p>"Indeed!"</p>
  <p>"As I neared West Lynne, I began to think what I should
          do. It was of no use trying to catch Barbara's
          attention on such a night as this; I had no money to
          pay for a lodging; so I turned off here, hoping I
          might by good luck, drop upon you. There was a
          little partition in this window-curtain; it had not
          been drawn close; and through it I could see you and
          Miss Carlyle. I saw her leave the room; I saw you
          come to the window <pb n="200"/> and open it, and
          then I spoke. Mr. Carlyle," he added, after a pause,
          "is this sort of life to go on with me for
          ever?"</p>
  <p>"I am deeply sorry for you, Richard," was the
          sympathising answer. "I wish I could remedy it."</p>
  <p>Before another word was spoken, the room door was tried,
          and then gently knocked at. Mr. Carlyle placed his
          hand on Richard, who was looking scared out of his
          wits.</p>
  <p>"Be still; be at ease, Richard: no one shall come in. It
          is only Peter."</p>
  <p>Not Peter's voice, however, but Joyce's was heard, in
          response to Mr. Carlyle's demand of who was
          there.</p>
  <p>"Miss Carlyle has left her handkerchief down stairs, sir,
          and has sent me for it."</p>
  <p>"You cannot come in; I am busy," was the answer,
          delivered in a clear and most decisive tone.</p>
  <p>"Who was it?" quivered Richard, as Joyce was heard going
          away.</p>
  <p>"It was Joyce."</p>
  <p>"What, is she here still? Has anything ever been heard of
          Afy, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Afy was here herself, two or three months ago."</p>
  <p>"Was she?" said Richard, beguiled for an instant from the
          thought of his own danger. "What is she doing?"</p>
  <p>"She is in service as a lady's-maid. Richard, I
          questioned Afy about Thorn. She protested solemnly
          to me that it was not Thorn who committed the deed;
          that it could not have been he, for Thorn was with
          her at the moment of its being done."</p>
  <p>"It's not true," said Richard. "It was Thorn."</p>
  <pb n="201"/>
  <p>"Richard, you cannot tell: you did not <hi>see</hi> it
          done."</p>
  <p>"I know that no man could have rushed out in that frantic
          manner, with those signs of guilt and fear about
          him, unless he had been engaged in a bad deed," was
          Richard Hare's answer. "It could have been no one
          else."</p>
  <p>"Afy declares he was with her," repeated Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Look here, sir: you are a sharp man, and folks say I am
          not, but I can see things, and draw my reasonings as
          well as they can, perhaps. If Thorn were not
          Hallijohn's murderer, why should he be persecuting
          me?—what would he care about me? And why should his
          face turn livid, as it has done, each time he has
          seen my eyes upon him? Whether he committed the
          murder or whether he didn't, he must know that I did
          not, because he came upon me, waiting, as he was
          tearing from the cottage."</p>
  <p>Dick's reasoning was not bad.</p>
  <p>"Another thing," he resumed. "Afy swore at the inquest
          that she was <hi>alone</hi> when the deed was done:
          that she was alone in the wood at the back of the
          cottage, and knew nothing about it till afterwards.
          How could she have sworn she was alone, if Thorn was
          with her?"</p>
  <p>The fact had entirely escaped Mr. Carlyle's memory in his
          conversation with Afy, or he would not have failed
          to point out the discrepancy, and to inquire how she
          could reconcile it. Yet her assertion to him had
          been most positive and solemn. There were
          difficulties in the matter which he could not
          reconcile.</p>
  <p>"Now that I have overgot my passion for Afy, I can <pb n="202"/> see her faults, Mr. Carlyle. She'd no
          more stick at an untruth, than she'd stick—"</p>
  <p>A most awful thundering at the room door: loud enough to
          bring the very house down. No officers of justice,
          searching for a fugitive, ever made a louder.
          Richard Hare, his face turned to chalk, his eyes
          starting, and his own light hair bristling up with
          horror, struggled into his wet smock-frock after a
          fashion, the tails up about his ears and the sleeves
          hanging, forced on his hat and its false whiskers,
          looked round in a bewildered manner for some
          cupboard or mouse-hole into which he might creep,
          and, seeing none, rushed to the fireplace and placed
          his foot on the fender. That he purposed an attempt
          at chimney climbing, was evident, though how the
          fire would have agreed with his pantaloons, not to
          speak of what they contained, poor Dick appeared
          completely to ignore. Mr. Carlyle drew him back,
          keeping his calm, powerful hand upon his shoulder,
          while certain sounds in an angry voice were jerked
          through the keyhole.</p>
  <p>"Richard, be a man; put aside this weakness, this fear.
          Have I not told you that harm shall not come near
          you in my house?"</p>
  <p>"It may be that officer man from London; he may have
          brought half a dozen more with him," gasped the
          unhappy Richard. "I said they might have dodged me
          all the way here."</p>
  <p>"Nonsense. Sit down, and be at rest. It is only Cornelia:
          and she will be as anxious to shield you from danger
          as I can be."</p>
  <p>"Is it?" cried the relieved Richard. "Can't you make her
          keep out?" he continued, his teeth still
          chattering.</p>
  <pb n="203"/>
  <p>"No, that I cannot; if she has a mind to come in," was
          the candid answer. "You remember what she was,
          Richard: she is not altered."</p>
  <p>Knowing that to speak on this side the door to his
          sister, when she was in one of her resolute moods,
          would be of no manner of use, Mr. Carlyle opened the
          door, dexterously swung himself through it, and shut
          it after him. There she stood; in a towering
          passion, too.</p>
  <p>But, just a word of interlude, as to what brought her
          there. Miss Carlyle had gone up to bed, taking her
          cold with her, ordered her gruel and forthwith
          proceeded to attire herself for the night, beginning
          with her head. Her day-cap off, and her night-cap
          on, of the remarkable form the reader had once the
          opportunity of taking the pattern of, she next
          considered about the flannel. Finding a piece
          convenient, some three yards square, she contrived
          to muffle that over all: but the process was long
          and difficult, her skill not accustomed to it, and
          the flannel perverse. The result was such that I
          only wish her picture could have been taken, and
          placed in the British Museum. A conical pyramid rose
          on the crown of her head, and a couple of small
          flannel corners flapped over her forehead; the sides
          resembled nothing but a judge's wig.</p>
  <p>Now, during this ceremony—previous to the settling on of
          the flannel ornament, or she could not have heard—it
          had struck Miss Carlyle that certain sounds, as of
          talking, proceeded from the room beneath, which she
          had just quitted. She possessed a remarkably keen
          sense of hearing: though, indeed, none of her
          faculties lacked the quality of keenness. The
          servants, Joyce <pb n="204"/> and Peter excepted,
          would not be convinced but that she must "listen:"
          but, in that, they did her injustice. At first she
          believed her brohter must be reading aloud to
          himself; but she soon decided otherwise. "Who on
          earth has he got in there with him?" said Miss
          Carlyle aloud.</p>
  <p>The head-dress arranged, she rang her bell. Joyce
          answered it.</p>
  <p>"Who is it that is with your master?"</p>
  <p>"Nobody, ma'am."</p>
  <p>"But I say there is. I can hear him talking."</p>
  <p>"I don't think anybody can be with him," persisted Joyce.
          "And the walls of this house are too well built,
          ma'am, for sounds from the down stairs rooms to
          penetrate here."</p>
  <p>"That's all you know about it," cried Miss Carlyle. "When
          talking goes on in that room, there's a certain
          sound given out which does penetrate here, and which
          my ears have grown accustomed to. Go and see who it
          is. I believe I left my handkerchief on the table:
          you can bring it up."</p>
  <p>Joyce departed, and Miss Carlyle proceeded to take off
          her things: her dress first, her silk petticoat
          next. She had arrived as far as the flannel
          petticoat when Joyce returned.</p>
  <p>"Yes, ma'am, some one is talking with master. I could not
          go in, for the door was bolted, and master called
          out that he was busy."</p>
  <p>Food for Miss Carlyle. She, feeling sure that no visitor
          had come to the house, ran her thoughts rapidly over
          the members of the household, and came to the
          conclusion that it must be the governess, Miss
          Manning, who had dared to closet herself with Mr.
          Carlyle. <pb n="205"/> This unlucky governess was
          pretty, and Miss Carlyle had been cautious to keep
          her and her prettiness very much out of her
          brother's sight: she knew the attraction he would
          present to her visions, or to those of any other
          unprovided-for governess. Oh yes; it was Miss
          Manning; she had stolen in, believing she, Miss
          Carlyle, was safe for the night; but she'd just
          unearth my lady. And what in the world could possess
          Archibald? —to lock the door!</p>
  <p>Looking round for something warm to throw over her
          shoulders, and catching up an article that looked as
          much like a green baize table-cover as anything
          else, and throwing it on, down stalked Miss Carlyle.
          And in this trim Mr. Carlyle beheld her when he came
          out.</p>
  <p>"Who have you got in that room?" she curtly asked.</p>
  <p>"It is some one on business," was his prompt reply.
          "Cornelia, you cannot go in."</p>
  <p>She very nearly laughed. Not go in!</p>
  <p>"Indeed it is much better that you should not. Pray go
          back. You will make your cold worse, standing
          here."</p>
  <p>"Now I want to know whether you are not ashamed of
          yourself?" she deliberately pursued. "You! a married
          man, with children in your house! I'd rather have
          believed anything downright wicked of myself, than
          of you, Archibald."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stared considerably.</p>
  <p>"Come; I'll have her out. And out of this house she
          tramps to-morrow morning. A couple of audacious
          ones, to be in there with the door locked, the
          moment you thought you had got rid of me! Stand
          aside, I say, Archibald: I <hi>will</hi> enter."</p>
  <pb n="206"/>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle never felt more inclined to laugh. And to
          Miss Carlyle's exceeding discomposure, she, at this
          juncture, saw the governess emerge from the grey
          parlour, glance at the hall clock, and retire
          again.</p>
  <p>"Why! she's there!" she uttered. "I thought she was with
          you."</p>
  <p>"Miss Manning locked in with me! Is that the mare's nest,
          Cornelia? I think your cold must have obscured your
          reason."</p>
  <p>"Well, I shall go in all the same. I tell you, Archibald,
          that I will see who is there."</p>
  <p>"If you persist in going in, you must go. But allow me to
          warn you that you will find tragedy in that room,
          not comedy. There is no woman in it; but there is a
          man; a man who came in through the window, like a
          hunted stag; a man upon whom a ban is set, and who
          fears the police are upon his track. Can you guess
          his name?"</p>
  <p>It was Miss Carlyle's turn to stare now. She opened her
          dry lips to speak, but they closed again.</p>
  <p>"It is Richard Hare, your kinsman. There's not a roof in
          the wide world open to him this bitter night."</p>
  <p>She said nothing. A long pause of dismay, and then she
          motioned to have the door opened.</p>
  <p>"You will not show yourself in—in that guise?"</p>
  <p>"Not show myself in this guise to Richard Hare?— whom I
          have whipped—when he was a child—ten times in a day!
          stand on ceremony with <hi>him!</hi> I dare say he
          looks no better than I do. But it's nothing short of
          madness, Archibald, for him to come here."</p>
  <p>He left her to enter, telling her to lock the door as
          soon as she got inside, and went into the adjoining
          room, which, by another door, opened to the <pb n="207"/> one Richard was in. There he rang the
          bell. It was answered by a footman.</p>
  <p>"Send Peter to me."</p>
  <p>"Lay supper here, Peter, for two," began Mr. Carlyle,
          when the old servant appeared. "A person is with me
          on business. What have you in the house?"</p>
  <p>"There's the spiced beef, sir: and some home-made raised
          pork-pies."</p>
  <p>"That will do," said Mr. Carlyle. "Put a jug of ale on
          the table, and everything likely to be wanted. And
          then the household can go to bed: we may be late,
          and the things can be removed in the morning. Oh—and
          Peter—none of you must come near the rooms, this or
          the next, under any pretence whatever, unless I
          ring, for I shall be too busy to be disturbed."</p>
  <p>"Very well, sir. Shall I serve the ham also?"</p>
  <p>"The ham?"</p>
  <p>"I beg pardon, sir; I guessed it might be Mr. Dill, and
          he is so fond of our hams."</p>
  <p>"Ah, you were always a shrewd guesser, Peter," smiled his
          master. "He is fond of ham, I know: yes, you may put
          it on the table. Don't forget the small kettle."</p>
  <p>The consequence of which little finesse on Mr. Carlyle's
          part was, that Peter announced in the kitchen that
          Mr. Dill had arrived, and supper was to be served
          for two. "But what a night for the old gentleman to
          have trudged through on foot!" ejaculated he.</p>
  <p>"And what a trudge he'll have of it back again, for it'll
          be worse then!" chimed in one of the maids.</p>
  <p>When Mr. Carlyle got back to the other room, his sister
          and Richard Hare had scarcely finished staring at
          each other. Richard had no doubt seen many a <pb n="208"/> fancifully-attired lady in the class
          amidst whom he had recently lived, but he could
          scarcely have had the luck to meet one who beat Miss
          Carlyle. Sure two such Guys never stood face to
          face! She: black shoes; black stockings; a flannel
          petticoat that reached to the calf; the nondescript
          shawl, which, to crown its other virtues, was
          finished off with jagged fringe; and the unsightly
          head-dress that was like nothing on earth! He:
          fustian clothes underneath, somewhat short of
          buttons; the smock frock still on, tails up and
          sleeves down; the battered hat and the bushy
          whiskers; with the trembling hands and the scared
          white face of terror! I have been at many a carnival
          abroad, but I assure you I never saw in the maskers
          a couple equal to the spectacle those two would have
          presented, borne along in a triumphal carnival
          car.</p>
  <p>"Please lock the door, Mis Cornelia," began poor
          shivering Dick, when he had feasted his eyes.</p>
  <p>"The door's locked," snapped she. "But what on earth
          brought you here, Richard? You must be worse than
          mad."</p>
  <p>"The Bow-street officers were after me in London," he
          meekly responded, unconsciously using a term which
          had been familiar to his boyish years. "I had to cut
          away without a thing belonging to me; without so
          much as a clean shirt."</p>
  <p>"They must be polite officers, not to have been after you
          before," was the consolatory remark of Miss Carlyle.
          "Are you going to dance a hornpipe through the
          streets of West Lynne to-morrow, and show yourself
          openly?"</p>
  <p>"Not if I can help it," replied Richard.</p>
  <p>"You might just as well do that, if you come to <pb n="209"/> West Lynne at all, for you can't be here
          now without being found out. There was a bother
          about you having been here before: I should like to
          know how it got abroad."</p>
  <p>"The life I lead is dreadful," cried Richard. "I might
          make up my mind to the toil, though that's hard,
          after being reared a gentleman; but to be in exile,
          banned, disgraced, afraid to show my face in broad
          day-light amidst my fellow-men, in dread every hour
          that the sword may fall! I would almost as soon be
          dead, as continue to live it."</p>
  <p>"Well, you have got nobody to grumble at: you brought it
          upon yourself," philosophically returned Miss
          Carlyle, as she opened the door to admit her
          brother. "You would go hunting after that brazen
          hussy, Afy, you know, in defiance of all that could
          be said to you."</p>
  <p>"That would not have brought it upon me," said Richard.
          "It was through that fiend's having killed
          Hallijohn: that was what brought the ban upon
          me."</p>
  <p>"It's a most extraordinary thing, if anybody else
            <hi>did</hi> kill him, that the facts can't be
          brought to light," retorted Miss Carlyle. "Here you
          tell a cock-and-bull story of some man having done
          it, some Thorn; but nobody ever saw or heard of him:
          at the time or since. It looks like a made-up story,
          Mr. Dick, to whiten yourself."</p>
  <p>"Made up!" panted Richard, in agitation, for it seemed
          cruel to him, especially in his present frame of
          mind, to have a doubt cast upon his tale. "It is
          Thorn who is setting the officers upon me. I have
          seen him three or four times within the last
          fortnight."</p>
  <p>"And why did you not turn the tables and set the officers
          upon him?" demanded Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <pb n="210"/>
  <p>"Because it would lead to no good. Where's the proof,
          save my bare word, that he committed the
          murder?"</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle rubbed her nose. "Dick Hare," said she.</p>
  <p>"Well?"</p>
  <p>"You know you always were the greatest natural that ever
          was let loose out of leading-strings."</p>
  <p>"I know I was always told so."</p>
  <p>"And it's what you always will be. If I were accused of
          committing a crime, which I knew another had
          committed, and not myself, should I be such an idiot
          as not to give that other into custody, if I got the
          chance? If you were not in such a cold, shivery,
          shaky state, I would treat you to a bit of my mind;
          you may rely upon that."</p>
  <p>"He was in league with Afy at that period," pursued
          Richard; "a deceitful, bad man; and he carries it in
          his countenance. And he must be in league with her
          still, if she asserts that he was in her company at
          the moment the murder was committed. Mr. Carlyle
          says she does; that she told him so the other day
          when she was here. He never was; and it was he, and
          no other, who did the murder."</p>
  <p>"Yes," burst forth Miss Carlyle, for the topic was sure
          to agitate her, "that Jezebel of Brass did presume
          to come here! She chose her time well: and may thank
          her lucky stars I was not at home. Archibald— he's a
          fool, too, quite as bad as you are, Dick Hare, in
          some things—actually suffered her to lodge here for
          two days! A vain, ill-conducted hussy, given to
          nothing but finery and folly!"</p>
  <p>"Afy said that she knew nothing of Thorn's movements <pb n="211"/> now, Richard, and had not for some
          time," interposed Mr. Carlyle, allowing his sister's
          compliment to pass in silence. "She heard a rumour,
          she thought, that he had gone abroad with his
          regiment."</p>
  <p>"So much the better of her, if it is true that she knows
          nothing of him," was Richard's comment. "I can
          answer for it that he is not abroad, but in
          England."</p>
  <p>"And where are you going to lodge to-night?" abruptly
          spoke Miss Carlyle, confronting Richard.</p>
  <p>"I don't know," was the broken-spirited answer sighed
          forth. "If I lie myself down in a snow-drift and am
          found frozen in the morning, it won't be of much
          moment."</p>
  <p>"Was that what you thought of doing?" returned Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"No," he mildly said. "What I had thought of doing was to
          ask Mr. Carlyle for the loan of a few shillings, and
          then I can get a bed. I know a place where I shall
          be in safety, two or three miles from this."</p>
  <p>"Richard, I would not turn a dog out, to go two or three
          miles, on such a night," impulsively uttered Mr.
          Carlyle. "You must stop here."</p>
  <p>"Indeed I don't see how he is to get up to a bedroom; or
          how a room is to be made ready for him, for the
          matter of that, without betraying his presence to
          the servants," snapped Miss Carlyle. And poor
          Richard Hare laid his aching head upon his
          hands.</p>
  <p>But now, Miss Carlyle's manner was more in fault than her
          heart. Will it be believed that, before speaking the
          above ungracious words, before Mr. Carlyle had
          touched upon the subject, she had been casting about
          in <pb n="212"/> her busy mind for the best plan of
          sleeping Richard— how it could be accomplished.</p>
  <p>"One thing is certain," she resumed. "That it will be
          impossible for you to sleep here without its being
          known to Joyce. And I suppose you and Joyce are upon
          the friendly terms of drawn daggers, for she
          believes you were the murderer of her father."</p>
  <p>"Let me disabuse her," interrupted Richard, his pale lips
          working as he started up. "Allow me to see her and
          convince her. Mr. Carlyle, why did you not tell
          Joyce better?"</p>
  <p>"There's that small room at the back of mine," said Miss
          Carlyle, returning to the practical part of the
          subject. "He might sleep there. But Joyce must be
          taken into confidence."</p>
  <p>"Joyce had better come in," said Mr. Carlyle. "I will say
          a word to her first."</p>
  <p>He unlocked the door and quitted the room, Miss Carlyle
          as jealously locking it again; called to Joyce, and
          beckoning her into the adjoining apartment. He knew
          that Joyce's belief of the guilt of Richard Hare was
          confirmed and strong: but he must uproot that
          belief, if Richard was to be lodged in his house
          that night.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," he began, "you remember how thoroughly imbued
          with the persuasion you were, that Afy went off
          after Richard Hare, and was living with him. I
          several times expressed my doubts upon the point:
          the fact was, I had positive information that she
          was not with him, and never had been, though I
          considered it expedient to keep my information to
          myself. You are convinced now that she was not with
          him?"</p>
  <p>"Of course I am, sir."</p>
  <pb n="213"/>
  <p>"Well, you see, Joyce, that my opinion would have been
          worth listening to. Now I am going to try to shake
          your belief upon another point, and if I assure you
          that I have equally good grounds for doing so, you
          will believe me."</p>
  <p>"I am quite certain, sir, that you would state nothing
          but what is true; and I know that your judgment is
          sound," was Joyce's answer.</p>
  <p>"Then I must tell you that I do not believe it was
          Richard Hare who murdered your father."</p>
  <p>" <hi>Sir!</hi> " uttered Joyce, amazed out of her
          senses.</p>
  <p>"I believe Richard Hare to be as innocent of the murder
          as you or I," he deliberately repeated. "I have held
          grounds for this opinion, Joyce, for many
          years."</p>
  <p>"Then, sir, who did do it?"</p>
  <p>"Afy's other lover. That dandy fellow, Thorn, as I truly
          believe."</p>
  <p>"And you say you have grounds, sir?" Joyce asked, after a
          pause.</p>
  <p>"Good grounds: and I tell you I have been in possession
          of them for years. I should be glad for you to think
          as I do."</p>
  <p>"But, sir—if Richard Hare was innocent, why did he run
          away, and keep away?"</p>
  <p>"Ah, why indeed! it is that which has done the mischief.
          His own weak cowardice was in fault; he feared to
          come back; and he felt that he could not remove the
          odium of circumstances. Joyce, I should like you to
          see him, and hear his story."</p>
  <p>"There is not much chance of that, sir. I dare say he
          will never venture here again."</p>
  <p>"He is here now."</p>
  <pb n="214"/>
  <p>Joyce looked up, considerably startled.</p>
  <p>"Here, in this house," repeated Mr. Carlyle. "He has
          taken shelter in it, and for the few hours that he
          will remain, we must extend our hospitality and
          protection to him, concealing him in the best manner
          we can. I thought it well that this confidence
          should be reposed in you, Joyce. Come now, and see
          him."</p>
  <p>Considering that it was a subdued interview—the voices
          subdued, I mean—it was a confused one. Richard
          talking vehemently, Joyce asking question after
          question, Miss Carlyle's tongue going as fast as
          theirs. The only silent one was Mr. Carlyle. Joyce
          could not refuse to believe protestations so solemn,
          and her suspicion veered round upon Captain
          Thorn.</p>
  <p>"And now about the bed," interjected Miss Carlyle,
          impatiently. "Where's he to sleep, Joyce? The only
          safe room, that I know of, will be the one through
          mine."</p>
  <p>"He can't sleep there, ma'am. Don't you know that the key
          of the door was lost last week, and we cannot open
          it."</p>
  <p>"So much the better. He'll be all the safer."</p>
  <p>"But how is he to get in?"</p>
  <p>"To get in? Why, through my room, of course. Does not
          mine open to it, stupid?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, well, ma'am, if you would like him to go through
          yours, that's different."</p>
  <p>"Why shouldn't he go through? Do you suppose I mind young
          Dick Hare? Not I, indeed," she irascibly continued.
          "I only wish he was young enough for me to flog him
          as I used to, that's all: he deserves it as much as
          anybody ever did, playing the fool as he has done,
          in all ways. I shall be in bed with the curtains <pb n="215"/> drawn, and his passing through won't
          harm me, and my lying there won't harm him. Stand on
          ceremony with Dick Hare! what next, I wonder?"</p>
  <p>This point being settled, Joyce went to put sheets upon
          the bed, and Miss Carlyle returned to her own. Mr.
          Carlyle meanwhile took Richard in to supper, and fed
          him plentifully and made him comfortable. Under the
          influence of the good cheer, the good fire, and the
          hot glass of brandy-and-water, which wound up the
          entertainment, Richard fell asleep in his chair. Not
          five minutes had he slept, however, when he started
          up, wild and haggard, beating off, as it were, some
          imaginary assailant.</p>
  <p>"It was not I!" he uttered, fearfully and passionately.
          "It is of no use to take me, for it was not I. It
          was another; he who—"</p>
  <p>"Richard, Richard!" soothingly said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Richard cast his bewildered eyes on the supper-table, the
          fire, on Mr. Carlyle, all re-assuring objects to
          look upon. "I declare, sir, I dreamt that they had
          grabbed me. What stupid things dreams are!"</p>
  <p>At this moment there came a gentle knock at the door, and
          Mr. Carlyle opened it. It was Joyce.</p>
  <p>"The room is ready, sir," she whispered, "and all the
          household are in bed."</p>
  <p>"Then now is your time, Richard. Good night."</p>
  <p>He stole up-stairs after Joyce, who piloted him through
          the room of Miss Carlyle. Nothing could be seen of
          that lady, though something might be heard: one,
          given to truth more than politeness, might have
          called it snoring. Joyce showed Richard his chamber,
          gave him the candle, and closed the door upon
          him.</p>
  <p>Poor hunted Richard! good night to you!</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVII. BARBARA'S HEART AT REST.</head>
  <p><hi>Morning</hi> dawned. The same dull weather, the same
          heavy fall of snow. Miss Carlyle took her breakfast
          in bed, an indulgence she had not favoured for ever
          so many years. Richard Hare rose, but remained in
          his chamber, and Joyce carried his breakfast in to
          him.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle entered whilst he was taking it. "How did you
          sleep, Richard?"</p>
  <p>"I slept well. I was so dead tired. What am I to do next,
          Mr. Carlyle? The sooner I get away from this, the
          better. I can't feel safe."</p>
  <p>"You must not think of it before evening. I am aware that
          you cannot remain here, save for a few temporary
          hours, as it would inevitably become known to the
          servants. You say you think of going to Liverpool or
          Manchester?"</p>
  <p>"To any large town: they are all alike to me; but one,
          pursued as I am, is safer in a large place than a
          small one."</p>
  <p>"I am inclined to think that this man, Thorn, only made a
          show of threatening you, Richard. If he be really
          the guilty party, his policy must be to keep all <pb n="217"/> in quietness. The very worst thing that
          could happen for him, would be your arrest."</p>
  <p>"Then why molest me? Why send an officer to dodge
          me?"</p>
  <p>"He did not like your molesting him, and he thought he
          would frighten you. After that day, you would
          probably have seen no more of the officer. You may
          depend upon one thing, Richard: had the policeman's
          object been to take you, he would have done so: he
          would not have contented himself with following you
          about from place to place. Besides, when a detective
          officer is employed to watch a party, he takes care
          not to allow himself to be seen: now this man showed
          himself to you more than once."</p>
  <p>"Yes, there's a good deal in that," observed Richard.
          "For, to one in his class of life, the bare
          suspicion of such a crime, brought against him,
          would crush him for ever in the eyes of his
          compeers."</p>
  <p>"It is difficult to me, Richard, to believe that he is in
          the class of life you speak of," observed Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"There's no doubt about it; there's none indeed. But that
          I did not much like to mention the name, for it
          can't be a pleasant name to you, I should have said
          last night who I have seen him walking with,"
          continued simple-hearted Richard.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle looked inquiringly. "Say on, Richard."</p>
  <p>"I have seen him, sir, with Sir Francis Levison: twice.
          Once he was talking to him at the door of the
          betting-rooms, and once they were walking
          arm-in-arm. They are apparently upon intimate
          terms."</p>
  <p>At this moment, a loud, flustering, angry voice was <pb n="218"/> heard calling from the stairs, and
          Richard leaped up as if he had been shot. His
          door—not the one leading to the room of Miss
          Carlyle—opened upon the corridor, and the voice
          sounded close, just as if its owner were coming in
          with a bound. It was the voice of Mr. Justice
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"Carlyle, where are you? Here's a pretty thing happened!
          Come down."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle for once in his life lost his calm
          equanimity, and sprang to the door, to keep it
          against invasion, as eagerly as Richard could have
          done. He forgot that Joyce had said the door was
          safely locked and the key mislaid. As to Richard, he
          rushed on his hat and his black whiskers, and
          hesitated between under the bed and inside the
          wardrobe.</p>
  <p>"Don't agitate yourself, Richard," whispered Mr. Carlyle:
          "there is no real danger. I will go and keep him
          safely."</p>
  <p>But when Mr. Carlyle got through his sister's bedroom, he
          found that lady had taken the initiative, and was
          leaning over the balustrades, having been arrested
          in the process of dressing. Her clothes were on, but
          her night-cap was not off: little cared she,
          however, who saw her night-cap.</p>
  <p>"What on earth brings you up in this weather?" began she,
          in a tone of exasperation.</p>
  <p>"I want to see Carlyle. Nice was I have had!"</p>
  <p>"What about? Anything concerning Anne, or her
          family?"</p>
  <p>"Anne be bothered," replied the justice, who was
          certainly, from some cause, in a furious temper. "It
          concerns that precious rascal, whom I am forced to
          call son. I am told he is here,"</p>
  <pb n="219"/>
  <p>Down the stairs leaped Mr. Carlyle, four at a time, wound
          his arm within Mr. Hare's, and led him to a
          sitting-room.</p>
  <p>"Good morning, justice. You had courage to venture up
          through the snow! What is the matter? you seem
          excited."</p>
  <p>"Excited!" raved the justice, dancing about the room,
          first on one leg, then on the other, like a cat upon
          hot bricks, "so would you be excited, if your life
          were worried out, as mine is, over a wicked scamp of
          a son. Why can't folks trouble their heads about
          their own business, and let my affairs alone? A pity
          but what he were hanged, and the thing done
          with!"</p>
  <p>"But what has happened?" questioned Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Why, this has happened," retorted the justice, throwing
          a letter on the table. "The post brought me this,
          just now—and pleasant information it gives!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle took up the note and read it. It purported to
          be from "a friend" to Justice Hare, informing that
          gentlemen that his "criminal son" was likely to have
          arrived at West Lynne, or would arrive in the course
          of a day or so: and it recommended Mr. Hare to speed
          his departure from it, lest he should be "pounced
          upon."</p>
  <p>"This letter is anonymous!" exclaimed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Of course it is," stamped the justice.</p>
  <p>"The only notice <hi>I</hi> should ever take of an
          anonymous letter would be to put it in the fire,"
          cried Mr. Carlyle, his lip curling with scorn.</p>
  <p>"But who has written it?" danced Justice Hare. <pb n="220"/> "And is Dick at West Lynne?—that's the
          question!"</p>
  <p>"Now, is it likely that he would come to West Lynne?"
          remonstrated Mr. Carlyle. "Justice, will you pardon
          me, if I venture to give you my candid opinion?"</p>
  <p>"The fool at West Lynne! running into the very jaws of
          death. By Jupiter! if I can drop upon him, I'll
          retain him in custody and make out a warrant for his
          committal! I'll have this everlasting bother
          over."</p>
  <p>"I was going to give you my opinion," quietly put Mr.
          Carlyle. "I fear, justice, you bring these
          annoyances upon yourself."</p>
  <p>"Bring them upon myself!" ranted the indignant justice.
          "I? Did I murder Hallijohn? did I fly away from the
          law? Am I in hiding, Beelzebub knows where? Do I
          take starts, right down into my native parish,
          disguised as a labourer, on purpose to worry my own
          father? Do I write anonymous letters? Bring them
          upon myself, do I? That cobs all, Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"You will not hear me out. It is known that you are much
          exasperated against Richard—"</p>
  <p>"And if your son serves you the same when he is grown up,
          shan't you be exasperated, pray?" fired Justice
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"Do hear me. It is known that you are much exasperated,
          and that any allusion to him excites and annoys you.
          Now, my opinion is, justice, that some busybody is
          raising these reports and writing these letters on
          purpose to annoy you. It may be somebody at West
          Lynne, very near us, for all we know."</p>
  <pb n="221"/>
  <p>"That's all rubbish," peevishly responded the justice,
          after a pause. "It's not likely. Who'd do it?"</p>
  <p>"It is very likely: but you may be sure they will not
          give us a clue as to the 'who.' I should put that
          letter in the fire, and think no more about it.
          That's the only way to serve them. A pretty laugh
          they have had in their sleeve, if it is anybody
          near, at seeing you wade up here through the snow
          this morning! They would know you were bringing the
          letter, to consult me."</p>
  <p>The justice—in spite of his obstinacy, he was somewhat
          easily persuaded to different views of things,
          especially by Mr. Carlyle—let fall his coat-tails,
          which had been gathered in his arms, as he stood
          with his back to the fire, and brought both his
          hands upon the table with a force enough to break
          it. "If I thought that," he spluttered, "if I could
          think it, I'd have the whole parish of West Lynne
          before me to-day, and commit them for trial."</p>
  <p>"It's a pity but what you could," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Well, it may be, or it may not be, that that villain is
          coming here," he resumed. "I shall call in at the
          police station, and tell them to keep a sharp look
          out."</p>
  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort, justice," exclaimed Mr.
          Carlyle, almost in agitation. "Richard is not likely
          to make his appearance at West Lynne; but if he did,
          would you, his own father, turn the flood upon him?
          Not a man living, but would cry shame upon you. Yes,
          Mr. Hare, they would: if other people shrink from
          telling you the truth, I do not. You have boasted
          that you would deliver Richard up, if he ever threw
          himself in your path; and your unnatural harshness
            <pb n="222"/> has been commented upon in no
          measured terms: it has, I give you my word. But of
          course nobody believed that you would really <hi>do
            it</hi> . You might take leave of your friends if
          you did, for you would find none willing to own you
          for one afterwards."</p>
  <p>"I took an oath I'd do it," said the justice.</p>
  <p>"You did not take an oath to go open-mouthed to the
          police station, upon the receipt of any despicable
          anonymous letter, or any foolish report, and say, 'I
          have news that my son will be here to-day; look
          after him.' Nonsense, justice! let the police look
          out for themselves; but don't <hi>you</hi> set them
          on."</p>
  <p>The justice growled, whether in assent or dissent, did
          not appear, and Mr. Carlyle resumed.</p>
  <p>"Have you shown this letter to Mrs. Hare? or mentioned it
          to her?"</p>
  <p>"Not I. I didn't give myself time. I had gone down to the
          front gate, to see how deep the snow lay in the
          road, when the postman came up; so I read it as I
          stood there. I went in for my coat and umbrella to
          come off to you, and Mrs. Hare wanted to know where
          I was going to in such a hurry; but I did not
          satisfy her."</p>
  <p>"I am truly glad to hear it," said Mr. Carlyle. "Such
          information, as this, could not fail to have a
          dangerous effect upon Mrs. Hare. Do not suffer a
          hint of it to escape you, justice: consider how much
          anxiety she has already suffered."</p>
  <p>"It's partly her own fault. Why can't she drive the
          ill-doing boy from her mind?"</p>
  <p>"If she could," said Mr. Carlyle, "she would be acting
          against human nature. There is one phase of the
          question which you may possibly not have glanced at,
            <pb n="223"/> justice. You speak of delivering
          your son up to the law: has it ever struck you that
          you would be delivering up at the same time your
          wife's life?"</p>
  <p>"Stuff!" said the justice.</p>
  <p>"You would find it no 'stuff.' So sure as Richard is
          brought to trial, whether through your means or
          through any other, so sure will it kill your
          wife."</p>
  <p>Mr. Hare took up the letter, which had lain open on the
          table, folded it, and put it in its envelope. "I
          suppose you don't know the writing?" he asked of Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I never saw it before, that I remember. Are you
          returning home?"</p>
  <p>"No. I shall go on to Beauchamp's and show him this, and
          hear what he says. It's not much farther."</p>
  <p>"Tell him not to speak of it, then. Beauchamp's safe, for
          his sympathies are with Richard—oh yes, they are,
          justice: ask him the question plainly if you like,
          and he will confess to it. I can tell you more
          sympathy goes with Richard than is acknowledged to
          you. But I would not show the letter to any one but
          Beauchamp," added Mr. Carlyle: "neither would I
          speak of it."</p>
  <p>"Who can have written it?" repeated the justice. "It
          bears, you see, the London post-mark."</p>
  <p>"It is too wide a speculation to enter upon. And no
          satisfactory conclusion could come of it."</p>
  <p>Justice Hare departed. Mr. Carlyle watched him down the
          avenue, striding under his umbrella, and then went
          up to Richard. Miss Carlyle was sitting with the
          latter then:</p>
  <p>"I thought I should have died," spoke poor Dick. I
          declare, Mr. Carlyle, my very blood seemed turned
            <pb n="224"/> to water, and I thought I should
          have died with fright. Is he gone away, all
          safe?"</p>
  <p>"He is gone, and it is all safe."</p>
  <p>"And what did he want? What was it he had heard of
          me?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle gave a brief explanation, and Richard
          immediately set down the letter as the work of
          Thorn. "Will it be possible for me to see my mother
          this time?" he demanded of Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I think it would be highly injudicious to let your
          mother know that you are here, or have been here,"
          was the answer of Mr. Carlyle. "She would naturally
          be inquiring into particulars, and when she came to
          hear that you were pursued, she would never have
          another minute's peace. You must forego the pleasure
          of seeing her this time, Richard."</p>
  <p>"And Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"Barbara might come and stay the day with you. Only—"</p>
  <p>"Only what, sir?" cried Richard, for Mr. Carlyle had
          hesitated.</p>
  <p>"I was thinking what a wretched morning it is for her to
          come out in."</p>
  <p>"She would go through an avalanche, she'd wade through
          mountains of snow, to see me," cried Richard
          eagerly. "And be delighted to do it."</p>
  <p>"She always was a little fool," put in Miss Carlyle,
          jerking some stitches out of her knitting.</p>
  <p>"I know she would," observed Mr. Carlyle, in answer to
          Richard. "We will try and get her here."</p>
  <p>"She can arrange about the money I am to have, just as
          well as my mother could, you know, sir."</p>
  <p>"Yes. For Barbara is in receipt of money of her <pb n="225"/> own now, and I know she would wish for
          nothing better than to apply some of it to you.
          Cornelia, as an excuse for getting her here, I must
          say to Mrs. Hare that you are ill, and wish Barbara
          to come for the day and bear you company. Shall
          I?"</p>
  <p>"Say I am dead, if you like," responded Miss Corny, who
          was in one of her cross moods.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle ordered the pony-carriage, and drove forth
          with John. He drew in at the Grove. Barbara and Mrs.
          Hare were seated together, and looked surprised at
          the early visit.</p>
  <p>"Did you want Mr. Hare, Archibald? He is out. He went
          while the breakfast was on the table, apparently in
          a desperate hurry."</p>
  <p>"I don't want Mr. Hare. I want Barbara. I have come to
          carry her off."</p>
  <p>"To carry off Barbara!" echoed Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"Cornelia is not well: she has caught a violent cold, and
          wishes Barbara to spend the day with her."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Mr. Carlyle, I cannot leave mamma to-day. She is not
          well herself, and she would be so dull without
          me."</p>
  <p>"Neither can I spare her, Archibald. It is not a day for
          Barbara to go out."</p>
  <p>How could he get to say a word to Barbara alone? Whilst
          he deliberated, talking on all the while to Mrs.
          Hare, a servant arrived at the sitting-room
          door.</p>
  <p>"The fishmonger's boy is come up, ma'am. His master has
          sent him to say that he fears there'll be no fish in
          to-day in anything like time. The trains cannot get
          up, with this weather."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare rose from her seat to hold a conference <pb n="226"/> at the door with her maid; and Mr.
          Carlyle seized his opportunity.</p>
  <p>"Barbara," he whispered, "make no opposition. You
            <hi>must</hi> come. What I really want you for is
          connected with Richard."</p>
  <p>She looked up at him, a startled glance, and the crimson
          flew to her face. Mrs. Hare returned to her seat.
          "Oh, such a day!" she shivered. "I am sure Cornelia
          cannot expect Barbara."</p>
  <p>"But Cornelia does. And there is my pony-carriage waiting
          to take her before I go to the office. Not a flake
          of snow can come near her, Mrs. Hare. The large warm
          apron will be up, and an umbrella will shield her
          bonnet and face. Get your things on, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Mamma, if you would not very much mind being left, I
          should like to go," said Barbara, with almost
          trembling eagerness.</p>
  <p>"But you would be sure to take cold, child."</p>
  <p>"Oh dear no. I can wrap up well."</p>
  <p>"And I will see that she comes home all right this
          evening," added Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>In a few minutes they were seated in the pony-carriage.
          Barbara's tongue was burning to ask questions, but
          John sat behind them, and would have overhead. When
          they arrived at East Lynne, Mr. Carlyle gave her his
          arm up the steps, and took her into the
          breakfast-room.</p>
  <p>"Will you prepare yourself for a surprise, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>Suspense—fear—had turned her very pale. "Something has
          happened to Richard!" she uttered.</p>
  <p>"Nothing that need agitate you. He is here."</p>
  <p>"Here! Where?"</p>
  <pb n="227"/>
  <p>"Here. Under this roof. He slept here last night."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald!"</p>
  <p>"Only fancy, Barbara! I opened the window at nine last
          night, to look at the weather, and in burst Richard.
          We could not let him go out again in the snow, so he
          slept here, in that room next Cornelia's."</p>
  <p>"Does she know of it?"</p>
  <p>"Of course. And Joyce also: we were obliged to tell
          Joyce. Imagine Richard's fear! Your father came this
          morning, calling up the stairs after me, saying he
          heard Richard was here. He meant at West Lynne. I
          thought Richard would have gone out of his mind with
          fright."</p>
  <p>A few more explanations, and Mr. Carlyle took Barbara
          into the room, Miss Carlyle and her knitting still
          keeping Richard company. In fact, that was to be the
          general sitting-room of the day, and a hot lunch,
          Richard's dinner, would be served in Miss Carlyle's
          chamber at one o'clock, Joyce only admitted to wait
          on them.</p>
  <p>"And now I must go," said Mr. Carlyle, after chatting a
          few minutes. "The office is waiting for me, and my
          poor ponies are in the snow."</p>
  <p>"But you'll be sure to be home early, Mr. Carlyle!" said
          Richard. "I dare not stop here: I must be off not a
          moment later than six or seven o'clock."</p>
  <p>"I will be home, Richard."</p>
  <p>Anxiously did Richard and Barbara consult that day, Miss
          Carlyle of course putting in her word. Over and over
          again did Barbara ask the particulars of the slight
          interviews Richard had had with Thorn: over and over
          again did she openly speculate upon what his name
          really was. "If you could but discover some one whom
          he knows, and inquire it!" she exclaimed.</p>
  <pb n="228"/>
  <p>"I have seen him with one person, but I can't inquire of
          him. They are too thick together, he and Thorn, and
          are birds of a feather also, I suspect. Great
          swells, both."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard, don't use those expressions. They are
          unsuited to a gentleman."</p>
  <p>Richard laughed bitterly. "A gentleman!"</p>
  <p>"Who is it you have seen Thorn with?" inquired
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Sir Francis Levison," replied Richard, glancing at Miss
          Carlyle, who drew in her lips ominously.</p>
  <p>"With whom?" uttered Barbara, betraying complete
          astonishment. "Do you know Sir Francis Levison?"</p>
  <p>"Oh yes, I know <hi>him</hi> . Nearly the only man about
          town that I do know."</p>
  <p>Barbara seemed lost in a puzzled reverie, and it was some
          time before she roused herself from it.</p>
  <p>"Are they at all alike?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Very much so, I suspect. Both bad men."</p>
  <p>"But I meant in person."</p>
  <p>"Not in the least. Except that they are both tall."</p>
  <p>Again Barbara sank into thought. Richard's words had
          surprised her. She was aroused from it by hearing a
          child's voice in the next room. She ran into it, and
          Miss Carlyle immediately fastened the intervening
          door.</p>
  <p>It was little Archibald Carlyle. Joyce had come in with
          the tray to lay the luncheon, and before she could
          lock the door, Archibald ran in after her. Barbara
          lifted him in her arms to carry him back to the
          nursery.</p>
  <p>"Oh, you heavy boy!" she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>Archie laughed. "Wilson says that," he lisped, "if ever
          she has to carry me."</p>
  <pb n="229"/>
  <p>"I have brought you a truant, Wilson," cried Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Oh, is it you, Miss Barbara? How are you, miss? Naughty
          boy!—yes; he ran away without my noticing him—he can
          open the door now."</p>
  <p>"You must be so kind as to keep him strictly in, for
          to-day," continued Barbara, authoritatively. "Miss
          Carlyle is not well, and cannot be subjected to the
          annoyance of his running into her room."</p>
  <p>Evening came, and the time of Richard's departure. It was
          again snowing heavily, though it had ceased in the
          middle of the day. Money for the present had been
          given to him; arrangements had been discussed. Mr.
          Carlyle insisted upon Richard's sending him his
          address, as soon as he should own one to send, and
          Richard faithfully promised. He was in very low
          spirits, almost as low as Barbara, who could not
          conceal her tears: they dropped in silence on her
          pretty silk dress. He was smuggled down the stairs,
          a large cloak of Miss Carlyle's enveloping him, into
          the room he had entered by storm on the previous
          night. Mr. Carlyle held the window open.</p>
  <p>"Good bye, Barbara dear. If ever you should be able to
          tell my mother of this day, say that my chief sorrow
          was, not to see her."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard!" she sobbed forth, broken-hearted, "good
          bye. May God be with you and bless you!"</p>
  <p>"Farewell, Richard," said Miss Carlyle: "don't you be
          fool enough to get into any more scrapes."</p>
  <p>Last of all he wrung the hand of Mr. Carlyle. The latter
          went outside with him for an instant, and their
          leave-taking was alone.</p>
  <p>Barbara returned to the chamber he had quitted. <pb n="230"/> She felt that she must indulge in a few
          moments' sobbing: Joyce was there, but Barbara was
          sobbing when she entered it.</p>
  <p>"It <hi>is</hi> hard for him, Miss Barbara; if he is
          really innocent."</p>
  <p>Barbara turned her streaming eyes upon her. "
            <hi>If!</hi> Joyce, do you doubt that he is
          innocent?"</p>
  <p>"I quite believe him to be so now, miss. Nobody could so
          solemnly assert what was not true. The thing at
          present will be to find that Captain Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Joyce!" exclaimed Barbara in excitement, seizing hold of
          Joyce's hands, "I thought I had found him; I
          believed, in my own mind, that I knew who he was. I
          don't mind telling you, though I have never before
          spoken of it: and with one thing or other this night
          I feel just as if I should die; as if I must speak.
          I thought it was Sir Francis Levison."</p>
  <p>Joyce stared with all her eyes. "Miss Barbara!"</p>
  <p>"I did. I have thought it ever since the night that Lady
          Isabel went away. My poor brother was at West Lynne
          then, he had come for a few hours, and he met the
          man, Thorn, walking in Bean-lane. He was in evening
          dress, and Richard described a peculiar motion of
          his, the throwing off his hair from his brow: he
          said his white hand and his diamond ring glittered
          in the moonlight. The white hand, the ring, the
          motion— for he was always doing it—all reminded me
          of Captain Levison, and from that hour until to-day
          I did believe him to be the man Richard saw. To-day
          Richard tells me that he knows Sir Francis Levison,
          and that he and Thorn are intimate. What I think now
          is, that this Thorn must have paid a flying visit to
          the neighbourhood <pb n="231"/> hood that night, to
          assist Captain Levison in the wicked work he had on
          hand."</p>
  <p>"How strange it all sounds!" uttered Joyce.</p>
  <p>"And I never could tell my suspicions to Mr. Carlyle! I
          did not like to mention Francis Levison's name to
          him."</p>
  <p>Barbara returned down stairs. "I must be going home," she
          said to Mr. Carlyle. "It is half-past seven, and
          mamma will be uneasy."</p>
  <p>"Whenever you like, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"But can I not walk? I am so sorry to take out your
          ponies again, and in this storm."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laughed. "Which would feel the storm worst,
          you or the ponies?"</p>
  <p>But when Barbara got outside, she saw that it was not the
          pony-carriage, but the chariot that was in waiting
          for her. She turned inquiringly to Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Did you think I should allow you to go home in an open
          carriage to-night, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"Are you coming also?"</p>
  <p>"I suppose I had better," he smiled. "To see that you and
          the carriage do not come to harm."</p>
  <p>Barbara withdrew to her corner of the chariot, and cried
          silently. Very very deeply did she mourn the unhappy
          situation, the privations of her brother: and she
          knew that he was one to feel them deeply: he could
          not battle with the world's hardships so bravely as
          many could have done. Mr. Carlyle only detected her
          emotion as they were nearing the Grove. He leaned
          forward, took her hand, and held it between his.</p>
  <p>"Don't grieve, Barbara. Bright days may be in store for
          Richard yet." The carriage stopped.</p>
  <pb n="232"/>
  <p>"You may go back," he said to the servants when he
          alighted. "I shall walk home."</p>
  <p>"Oh," exclaimed Barbara, "I do think you intend to spend
          the evening with us! Mamma will be so glad."</p>
  <p>Her voice showed that she was glad also. Mr. Carlyle drew
          her hand within his arm as they walked up the
          path.</p>
  <p>But Barbara had reckoned without her host. Mrs. Hare was
          in bed, consequently could not be pleased at the
          visit of Mr. Carlyle. The justice had gone out, and
          she, feeling tired and not well, thought she would
          retire to rest. Barbara stole into her room, but
          found her asleep; so that it fell to Barbara to
          entertain Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>They stood together before the large pier-glass in front
          of the blazing fire. Barbara was thinking over the
          events of the day. What Mr. Carlyle was thinking of
          was best known to himself: his eyes, covered with
          their drooping eyelids, were cast upon Barbara.
          There was a long silence: at length Barbara seemed
          to feel that his gaze was on her, and she looked up
          at him.</p>
  <p>"Will you marry me, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>The words were spoken in the quietest, most
          matter-of-fact tone, just as if he had said, Shall I
          give you a chair, Barbara. But oh! the change that
          passed over her countenance! the sudden light of
          joy; the scarlet flush of emotion and of happiness.
          Then it all faded down to paleness and to
          sadness.</p>
  <p>She shook her head in the negative. "But you are very
          kind to ask me," she added in words.</p>
  <p>"What is the impediment, Barbara?"</p>
  <p>Another rush of colour as before, and a deep silence. <pb n="233"/> Mr. Carlyle put his arm round her, and
          bent his face on a level with hers.</p>
  <p>"Whisper it to me, Barbara."</p>
  <p>She burst into a flood of tears.</p>
  <p>"Is it because I once married another?"</p>
  <p>"No, no. It is the remembrance of that night— you cannot
          have forgotten it, and it is stamped on my brain in
          letters of fire. I never thought so to betray
          myself. But for what passed that night, you would
          not have asked me now."</p>
  <p>"Barbara!"</p>
  <p>She glanced up at him; the tone was so painful.</p>
  <p>"Do you know that I <hi>love</hi> you? that there is none
          other in the world whom I would care to marry, but
          you? Nay, Barbara, when happiness is within our
          reach, let us not throw it away upon a chimera."</p>
  <p>She cried more softly, leaning upon his arm. "Happiness?
          Would it be happiness for you?"</p>
  <p>"Great and deep happiness," he whispered.</p>
  <p>She read truth in his countenance, and a sweet smile
          illumined her sunny features. Mr. Carlyle read its
          signs.</p>
  <p>"You love me as much as ever, Barbara!"</p>
  <p>"Far more; far more," was the murmured answer, and Mr.
          Carlyle held her closer, and drew her face fondly to
          his. Barbara's heart was at length at rest; and she
          had been content to remain where she was for
          ever.</p>
  <p>And Richard? Had he got clear off? Richard was stealing
          along the road, plunging into the snow by the hedge
          because it was more sheltered there than in the
          beaten path, when his umbrella came in contact with
          another umbrella. Miss Carlyle had furnished it to
            <pb n="234"/> him; not to protect his battered
          hat, but to protect his face from being seen by the
          passers-by. The umbrella he encountered was an
          aristocratic silk one, with an ivory handle: Dick's
          was a democratic cotton, with hardly any handle at
          all; and the respective owners had been bearing on,
          heads down and umbrellas out, till they, the
          umbrellas, met smash, right underneath a gas-lamp.
          Aside went each umbrella, and the antagonists stared
          at each other.</p>
  <p>"How dared you, fellow? Can't you see where you are going
          to?"</p>
  <p>Dick thought he should have dropped. He would have given
          all the money his pockets held, if the friendly
          earth had but opened and swallowed him in. For he,
          now peering into his face, was his own father.</p>
  <p>Uttering an exclamation of dismay, which broke from him
          involuntarily, Richard sped away with the swiftness
          of an arrow. Did Justice Hare recognise the tones?
          It cannot be said. He saw a rough, strange-looking
          man with bushy black whiskers, who was evidently
          scared at the sight of him. That was nothing; for
          the justice, being a justice and a strict one, was
          regarded with considerable awe in the parish, by
          those of Dick's apparent calibre. Nevertheless, he
          stood still and gazed in the direction, until all
          sound of Richard's footsteps had died away in the
          distance.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVIII. FROZEN TO DEATH IN THE SNOW.</head>
  <p><hi>Tears</hi> were streaming down the face of Mrs. Hare.
          It was a bright morning after the snow-storm, so
          bright that the sky was blue and the sun was
          shining, but the snow lay deeply upon the ground.
          Mrs. Hare sat in her chair, enjoying the brightness,
          and Mr. Carlyle stood near her. The tears were of
          joy and of grief mingled: of grief at hearing that
          she should at last have to part with Barbara; of joy
          that she was going to one so entirely worthy of her
          as was Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, she has had a happy home here: you will
          render yours as much so?"</p>
  <p>"To the very utmost of my power."</p>
  <p>"You will be ever kind to her, ever cherish her?"</p>
  <p>"With my whole heart and strength. Dear Mrs. Hare, I
          thought you knew me too well to doubt me."</p>
  <p>"Doubt you! I do not doubt you; I trust you implicitly,
          Archibald. Had the whole world laid themselves at
          Barbara's feet, I should have prayed that she might
          choose you."</p>
  <p>A smile flitted over Mr. Carlyle's lips. <hi>He</hi> knew
          it was what Barbara would have done.</p>
  <p>"But, Archibald, what about Cornelia?" resumed Mrs. Hare.
          "I would not for a moment interfere in <pb n="236"/>
          your affairs, or in the arrangements you and Barbara
          may agree upon: but I cannot help thinking that
          married people are better alone."</p>
  <p>"Cornelia will quit East Lynne," said Mr. Carlyle. "I
          have not spoken to her yet, but I shall do so now. I
          have long made my mind up to that; that if I ever
          married again, I and my wife would live alone. It is
          said she interfered too much with my former wife:
          had I suspected it, Cornelia should not have
          remained in the house a day. Rest assured that
          Barbara shall not be subjected to the chance."</p>
  <p>"How did <hi>you</hi> come over her?" demanded the
          justice, who had already given his gratified
          consent, and who now entered, in his dressing-gown
          and morning wig. "Others have tried it on, and
          Barbara would not listen to any of them."</p>
  <p>"I suppose I must have cast a spell upon her," answered
          Mr. Carlyle, breaking into a smile.</p>
  <p>"Here she is. Barbara," cried the unceremonious justice,
          "what is it that you see in Carlyle more than in
          anybody else?"</p>
  <p>Barbara's scarlet cheeks answered for her. "Papa," she
          said, "Otway Bethel is at the door, asking to speak
          to you. Jasper says he won't come in."</p>
  <p>"Then I'm sure I am not going out to him in the cold.
          Here, Mr. Otway, what are you afraid of? Come
          in."</p>
  <p>Otway Bethel made his appearance, in his usual sporting
          costume. But he did not seem altogether at his ease
          in the presence of Mrs. Hare and Barbara.</p>
  <p>"The colonel wished me to see you, justice, to ask if you
          had any objection to the meeting being put off from
          one o'clock till two," cried he, after nodding to
            <pb n="237"/> Mr. Carlyle. "He has got a friend
          coming to see him unexpectedly, who will leave again
          by the two o'clock train."</p>
  <p>"I don't care which it is," answered Mr. Hare. "Two
          o'clock will do as well as one for me."</p>
  <p>"That's all right, then, and I'll drop in upon Herbert
          and Pinner, and acquaint them. Have you heard of the
          dead man being found?"</p>
  <p>"What dead man?" cried Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>"Some chap who must have missed his way last night: or
          who perhaps laid himself down, overcome with
          fatigue. He was found this morning, frozen to death.
          I have just seen him: he is lying in that hollow,
          just out of the road, as you turn down towards
          Hallijohn's old cottage. I saw a lot of folks making
          for the place, so I went too."</p>
  <p>"Who is he?" inquired Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>"A stranger, I think. I didn't recognise his face. He is
          in a smock-frock. A young man, with a profusion of
          dark whisker."</p>
  <p>"By George, but I shouldn't wonder but it's the fellow
          who last night nearly broke my umbrella!" ejaculated
          the justice. "He wore a smock-frock, and looked
          young, and his whiskers were fierce enough for an
          Irishman's. I thought the fellow a little cracked.
          He was coming blundering along, his umbrella before
          him, seeing nothing, and he ran right against me. I
          blew him up naturally; but no sooner had he looked
          at me than he uttered an exclamation of dismay, and
          made off like a shot. I thought it curious. Perhaps
          it was the man you speak of, Mr. Otway?"</p>
  <p>"I shouldn't wonder, Sir."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced at Barbara. She had turned <pb n="238"/> deadly white. He saw what was passing in
          her mind. Could it be the ill-fated Richard? As Mr.
          Carlyle crossed the room to the door, he contrived
          to whisper a word to her in passing.</p>
  <p>"I will go and see, and bring you back the news. Bear up,
          my darling."</p>
  <p>"Are you departing, Archibald?" said Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"I am going to have a look at this man that Bethel talks
          of. Curious as any school-girl, you see, yet."</p>
  <p>He walked very quickly down the garden, and Barbara
          watched him from the gate. <hi>How</hi> should she
          bear the sickening suspense until he returned?
          Something seemed to tell her fears that it was
          Richard. Otway Bethel departed; and the justice,
          exchanging his wig and gown for a sprucer wig and a
          coat, followed next: he, too, must have a look at
          the deceased. In a small place like West Lynne,
          every little event causes a stir and excites
          curiosity: what would not be noticed in a large
          town, is there magnified into a wonder that all
          folks run after.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was the first back. Barbara went to the
          porch, and waited: had it been to save her life, she
          could not have gone to meet him: the suspense was
          fearful.</p>
  <p>But, as he neared her, he smiled and nodded gaily, as if
          he would say, Fear not. Barbara's heart acquired a
          grain of courage from it; but still it throbbed
          painfully.</p>
  <p>"We were falsely alarmed, Barbara," he whispered. "It is
          a complete stranger; some poor man who did not know
          the road. He is not in the least like Richard, and
          his whiskers are red."</p>
  <pb n="239"/>
  <p>For the moment she thought she should have fainted, so
          great was the relief.</p>
  <p>"But, Archibald, could it have been Richard, think you,
          who ran against papa—as he spoke of?"</p>
  <p>"There is little doubt it was. The cry of dismay, when he
          recognised Justice Hare, and his speeding off, would
          betray that it was Richard."</p>
  <p>"And papa did not know him! What a merciful escape!"</p>
  <p>"Is the poor man quite dead, Archibald?" inquired Mrs.
          Hare, when he reached the sitting-room.</p>
  <p>"Quite so. He seems to have been dead some hours."</p>
  <p>"Did you recognise him?"</p>
  <p>"Not at all. He is a stranger."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle's cold was better that evening; in fact, she
          seemed quite herself again, and Mr. Carlyle
          introduced the subject of his marriage. It was after
          dinner that he began upon it.</p>
  <p>"Cornelia, when I married Lady Isabel Vane, you
          reproached me severely with having kept you in the
          dark—"</p>
  <p>"If you had not kept me in the dark, but consulted me, as
          any other Christian would, the course of events
          might have been wholly changed, and the wretchedness
          and disgrace, that fell on this house, been spared
          to it," fiercely interrupted Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"We will leave the past," he said, "and consider the
          future. I was about to remark, that I do not intend
          to fall under your displeasure for the like offence.
          I believe you have never wholly forgiven it."</p>
  <pb n="240"/>
  <p>"And never shall," cried she impetuously. "I did not
          deserve the slight."</p>
  <p>"Therefore, almost as soon as I know it myself, I
          acquaint you. I am about to marry a second time,
          Cornelia."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle started up. Her spectacles dropped off her
          nose, and a knitting-box, which she happened to have
          on her knee, clattered to the ground.</p>
  <p>"What did you say?" she uttered, aghast.</p>
  <p>"I am about to marry."</p>
  <p>"You!"</p>
  <p>"I. Is there anything so very astonishing in it?"</p>
  <p>"For the love of common sense, don't go and make such a
          fool of yourself! You have done it once: was not
          that enough for you, but you must run your head into
          the noose again?"</p>
  <p>"Now, Cornelia, can you wonder that I do not speak to you
          of such things, when you meet them in this way? You
          treat me just as you did when I was a child. It is
          very foolish."</p>
  <p>"When folks act childishly, they must be treated as
          children. I always thought you were mad when you
          married before, but I shall think you doubly mad
          now."</p>
  <p>"Because you have preferred to remain single and solitary
          yourself, is it any reason why you should condemn me
          to do the same? You are happy alone; I should be
          happier with a wife."</p>
  <p>"That she may go and disgrace you, as the last one did!"
          intemperately spoke Miss Carlyle, caring not a rush
          what she said in her storm of anger. Mr. Carlyle's
          brow flushed but he controlled his temper.</p>
  <pb n="241"/>
  <p>"No," he calmly replied. "I am not afraid of that, in the
          one I have now chosen."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny gathered her knitting together; he had picked
          up her box. Her hands trembled, and the lines of her
          face were working. It was a blow to her as keen as
          the other had been.</p>
  <p>"Pray who is it that you have chosen?" she jerked forth.
          "The whole neighbourhood has been after you."</p>
  <p>"Let it be who it will, Cornelia, you will be sure to
          grumble. Were I to say that it was a royal princess,
          or a peasant's daughter, you would equally see
          grounds for finding fault."</p>
  <p>"Of course I should. I know who it is—that stuck-up
          Louisa Dobede."</p>
  <p>"No, it is not. I never had the slightest intention of
          choosing Louisa Dobede; nor she of choosing me. I am
          marrying to please myself, and, for a wife, Louisa
          Dobede would not please me."</p>
  <p>"As you did before," sarcastically put in Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>"Yes; as I did before."</p>
  <p>"Well, can't you open your mouth, and say who it is?" was
          the exasperated rejoinder.</p>
  <p>"It is Barbara Hare."</p>
  <p>"Who?" shrieked Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"You are not deaf, Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"Well, you <hi>are</hi> an idiot!" she exclaimed, lifting
          up her hands and eyes.</p>
  <p>"Thank you," he said, but without any signs of
          irritation.</p>
  <p>"And so you are; <hi>you are</hi> , Archibald. To suffer
            <pb n="242"/> that girl, who has been angling
          after you so long, to catch you at last."</p>
  <p>"She has not angled after me: had she done so, she would
          probably never have been Mrs. Carlyle. Whatever
          passing fancy she may have entertained for me in
          earlier days, she has shown no symptoms of it of
          late years: and I am quite certain that she had no
          more thought, or idea, that I should choose her for
          my second wife, than you had that I should choose
          you. Others have angled after me too palpably, but
          Barbara has not."</p>
  <p>"She is a little conceited minx; as vain as she is
          high."</p>
  <p>"What else have you to urge against her?"</p>
  <p>"I would have married a girl without a slur—if I must
          have married," aggravatingly returned Miss
          Corny.</p>
  <p>"Slur?"</p>
  <p>"Slur, yes! Dear me, is it an honour—to possess a brother
          such as Richard?"</p>
  <p>"That is no slur upon Barbara. And the time may come when
          it will be taken off Richard."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny sniffed. "Pigs may fly: but <hi>I</hi> never
          saw them try at it."</p>
  <p>"The next consideration, Cornelia, is about your
          residence. You will go back, I presume, to your own
          home."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny did not believe her own ears. "Go back to my
          own home!" she exclaimed. "I shall do nothing of the
          sort. I shall stop at East Lynne. What's to hinder
          me?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle shook his head. "It cannot be," he said, in a
          low, decisive tone.</p>
  <p>"Who says so?" she sharply asked.</p>
  <pb n="243"/>
  <p>"I do. Have you forgotten that night—when <hi>she</hi>
          went away—the words spoken by Joyce? Cornelia,
          whether they were true or false, I will not subject
          another to the chance."</p>
  <p>She did not answer. Her lips only parted and closed
          again. Somehow Miss Carlyle could not bear to be
          reminded of that revelation of Joyce's: it subdued
          even her.</p>
  <p>"I cast no reflection upon you," hastily continued Mr.
          Carlyle. "You have been mistress of a house for many
          years, and you naturally look to be so; it is right
          you should. But two mistresses in a house do not
          answer, Cornelia: they never did, and they never
          will."</p>
  <p>"Why did you not give me so much of your sentiments when
          I first came to East Lynne?" she burst forth. "I
          hate hypocrisy."</p>
  <p>"They were not my sentiments then: I possessed none. I
          was ignorant upon the subject, as I was upon others.
          Experience has come to me since."</p>
  <p>"You will not find a better mistress of a house than I
          have made you," she said resentfully.</p>
  <p>"I do not look for it. The tenants leave your house in
          March, do they not?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, they do," snapped Miss Corny. "But as we are on the
          subject of details, of ways and means, allow me to
          tell you that if you did what is right, <hi>you</hi>
          would move into that house of mine, and I will go to
          a smaller —as you seem to think I shall poison
          Barbara if I remained with her. East Lynne is a vast
          deal too fine and too grand for you."</p>
  <p>"I do not consider it so. I shall not quit East
          Lynne."</p>
  <pb n="244"/>
  <p>"Are you aware that, in leaving your house, I take my
          income with me, Mr. Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"Most certainly. Your income is yours, and you will
          require it for your own purposes. I have neither
          right to it, nor wish for it."</p>
  <p>"The withdrawal will make a pretty good hole in your
          income, I can tell you that. Take care that you and
          East Lynne don't go bankrupt together."</p>
  <p>Mr Carlyle laughed. "I will take care of that, Cornelia.
          If I were not fully justified in living at East
          Lynne, I should not do so. With all my extravagance
          —as you are pleased to term it—I am putting by
          plenty of money, and you know it."</p>
  <p>"You might put by more, were your expenses less," rebuked
          Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I have no fancy to live as a hermit, or a miser."</p>
  <p>"No; nor as a man of common sense. To think that you
          should sacrifice yourself again!" she wailed, in a
          tone of lamentation. "And to Barbara Hare! an
          extravagant, vain, upstart little reptile."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle took the compliments to Barbara with
          composure. It was of no use doing otherwise. Miss
          Corny was not likely to regard her with more
          graciousness, since it was Barbara's coming there
          that turned herself out of East Lynne.</p>
  <p>At this moment the summons of a visitor was heard. Even
          that excited the ire of Miss Carlyle. "I wonder
          who's come bothering to-night?" she uttered.</p>
  <p>Peter entered. "It is Major Thorn, sir. I have shown him
          into the drawing-room."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was surprised. He proceeded to the
          drawing-room, and Miss Carlyle rang for Joyce.
          Strange to say, she had no thought of rebelling
          against the <pb n="245"/> decree. An innate
          consciousness had long been hers that, should Mr.
          Carlyle marry again, her sojourn in the house would
          terminate. East Lynne was Mr. Carlyle's: she had
          learnt that he could be firm upon occasions, and the
          tone of his voice had told that this was one of
          them.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," began she, after her own unceremonious fashion,
          "your master is going to make a simpleton of himself
          a second time, so I shall leave him and East Lynne
          to it. Will you go with me, and be my upper maid
          again?"</p>
  <p>"What ma'am?" exclaimed Joyce, in bewilderment: "what did
          you say master was going to do?"</p>
  <p>"To make a simpleton of himself," irascibly repeated Miss
          Carlyle. "He is going to tie himself up again with a
          wife; that's what he's going to do. Now, do you stop
          here, or will you go with me?"</p>
  <p>"I would go with you, ma'am, but—but for one thing."</p>
  <p>"What's that?"</p>
  <p>"The promise I gave to Lady Isabel. She exacted it from
          me when she thought she was about to die—a promise
          that I would remain with her children. She did not
          leave them by death after all: but it comes to the
          same thing."</p>
  <p>"Not exactly," sarcastically spoke Miss Carlyle. "But
          there's another side of the question, Joyce, which
          you may not have looked at. When there shall be
          another mistress at East Lynne, will you be
          permitted to remain here?"</p>
  <p>Joyce considered: she could not see her way altogether
          clear. "Allow me to give you my answer a little
          later," she said to Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <pb n="246"/>
  <p>"Such a journey!" Major Thorn was saying, meanwhile, to
          Mr. Carlyle. "It is my general luck to get ill
          weather when I travel. Rain and hail, thunder and
          heat, nothing bad comes amiss, when I am out. The
          snow lay on the rails, I don't know how thick: at
          one station we were detained two hours."</p>
  <p>"Are you purposing to make any stay at West Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"Off again to-morrow. My leave, this time, is to be spent
          at my mother's. I may bestow a week of it, or so, on
          West Lynne, but am not sure. I must be back in
          Ireland in a month. Such a horrid bog-hole we are
          quartered in just now! The truth is, Carlyle, a lady
          has brought me here."</p>
  <p>"Indeed!"</p>
  <p>"I am in love with Barbara Hare. The little jade has said
          No to me by letter: but, as Herbert says, there's
          nothing like urging your suit in person. And I have
          come to do so."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle took an instant's counsel with himself, and
          decided that it would be a kind thing to tell the
          major the state of the case: far more kind than to
          subject him to another rejection from Barbara, and
          to suffer the facts to reach him by common
          report.</p>
  <p>"Will you shoot me, major, if I venture to tell you —that
          any second application to Barbara would be
          futile."</p>
  <p>"She is not appropriated, is she?" hurriedly cried Major
          Thorn. "She's not married?"</p>
  <p>"She is not married. She is going to be."</p>
  <p>"Oh! That's just like my unlucky fate. And who is the
          happy man?"</p>
  <pb n="247"/>
  <p>"You must promise not to call me out, if I disclose his
          name."</p>
  <p>"Carlyle! It is not yourself?"</p>
  <p>"You have said it.</p>
  <p>There was a brief silence. It was Mr. Carlyle who broke
          it.</p>
  <p>"It need not make us the less good friends, Thorn. Do not
          allow it to do so."</p>
  <p>The major put out his hand, and grasped Mr. Carlyle's.
          "No, by Jove, it shan't! It's all fate. And if she
          must go beside me, I'd rather see her yours than any
          other man's upon earth. Were you engaged when I
          asked Barbara to be my wife, some months ago."</p>
  <p>"No. We have been engaged but very recently."</p>
  <p>"Did Barbara betray to you that I asked her?" proceeded
          Major Thorn, a shade of mortification rising to his
          face.</p>
  <p>"Certainly not: you do not know Barbara, if you fancy she
          could be guilty of it. The justice managed to let it
          out to me during an explosion of wrath."</p>
  <p>"Wrath because I asked for his daughter."</p>
  <p>"Wrath against Barbara, for refusing. Not particularly at
          her refusing you," added Mr. Carlyle, correcting
          himself; "but she was in the habit of refusing all
          who asked her, and thereby fell under
          displeasure."</p>
  <p>"Did she refuse you?"</p>
  <p>"No," smiled Mr. Carlyle, "she accepted me."</p>
  <p>"Ah, well; it's all fate, I say. But she is an uncommon
          nice girl, and I wish it had been my luck to get
          her."</p>
  <p>"To go from one subject to another," resumed Mr. Carlyle,
          "there is a question I have long thought to <pb n="248"/> put to you, Thorn, if we ever met again.
          Which year was it that you were staying at
          Swainson?"</p>
  <p>Major Thorn mentioned it. It was the year of Hallijohn's
          murder.</p>
  <p>"As I thought—in fact knew," said Mr. Carlyle. "Did you,
          while you were stopping there, ever come across a
          namesake of yours, one Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"I believe I did. But I don't know the man of my own
          knowledge, and I saw him but once only. I don't
          think he was living at Swainson. I never observed
          him in the town."</p>
  <p>"Where did you meet with him?"</p>
  <p>"At a roadside beer-shop, about two miles from Swainson.
          I was riding one day, when a fearful storm came on,
          and I took shelter there. Scarcely had I entered,
          when another horseman rode up, and he likewise took
          shelter. A tall, dandified man, aristocratic and
          exclusive. When he departed—for he quitted first,
          the storm being over—I asked the people who he was.
          They said they did not know, though they often saw
          him ride by; but a man who was in there, drinking,
          said he was a Captain Thorn. The same man, by the
          way, volunteered the information that he came from a
          distance, somewhere near West Lynne: I remember
          that."</p>
  <p>"That Captain Thorn did?"</p>
  <p>"No; that he himself did. He appeared to know nothing of
          Captain Thorn, beyond the name."</p>
  <p>It seemed to be ever so! Scraps of information, but
          nothing tangible, nothing to lay hold of, or to know
          the man by. Would it be thus always?</p>
  <p>"Should you recognise him again, were you to see <pb n="249"/> him?" resumed Mr. Carlyle, awaking from
          his reverie.</p>
  <p>"I think I should. There was something peculiar in his
          countenance, and I remember it well yet."</p>
  <p>"Were you by chance to meet him, and discover his real
          name—for I have reason to believe that Thorn, the
          one he went by then, was an assumed one—will you
          oblige me by letting me know it?"</p>
  <p>"With all the pleasure in life," replied the major "The
          chances are against it, though, confined as I am to
          that confounded sister country. Other regiments get
          the luck of being quartered in the metropolis, or
          near it: ours doesn't."</p>
  <p>When Major Thorn had departed, and Mr. Carlyle was about
          to return to the room where he had left his sister,
          he was interrupted by Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Sir," she began, "Miss Carlyle tells me that there is
          going to be a change at East Lynne."</p>
  <p>The words took Mr. Carlyle by surprise. "Miss Carlyle has
          been in a hurry to tell you!" he remarked, a certain
          haughty displeasure in his tone.</p>
  <p>"She did not speak for the sake of telling me, sir; but I
          fancy she was thinking about her own plans. She
          inquired whether I would go with her when she left,
          or whether I meant to remain at East Lynne. I could
          not answer her, sir, until I had spoken to you."</p>
  <p>"Well?" said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I gave a promise, sir, to—to—my late lady, that I would
          remain with her children so long as I was permitted:
          she asked it of me when she was ill; when she
          thought she was going to die. What I would inquire
            <pb n="250"/> of you, sir, is, whether the changes
          will make any difference to my staying?"</p>
  <p>"No," he decisively replied. "I also, Joyce, wish you to
          remain with the children."</p>
  <p>"It is well, sir," Joyce answered: and her face looked
          bright as she quitted the room.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIX. MR. DILL IN AN EMBROIDERED
          SHIRT-FRONT.</head>
  <p><hi>It</hi> was a lovely morning in June, and all West
          Lynne was astir. West Lynne generally was astir in
          the morning, but not in the bustling manner that
          might be observed now. People were abroad in
          numbers, pressing down to St. Jude's church: for it
          was the day of Mr. Carlyle's marriage to Barbara
          Hare.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle made herself into a sort of martyr. She
          would not go near it: fine weddings in fine churches
          did not suit her, she said, they could tie
          themselves up together fast enough without her
          presence. She had invited the little Carlyles and
          their governess and Joyce to spend the day with her;
          and she persisted in regarding the children as
          martyrs too, in being obliged to submit to the
          advent of a second mother. She was back in her old
          house again, next door to the office, settled there
          for life now, with her servants. Peter had mortally
          offended her, in electing to remain at East
          Lynne.</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill committed himself terribly on the wedding
          morning, and lucky was he to escape a shaking, like
          the one he had received on Mr. Carlyle's first
          marriage. About ten o'clock he made his appearance
          at Miss Carlyle's: he was a man of the old school,
          possessing <pb n="252"/> old-fashioned notions, and
          he had deemed that to step in, to congratulate her
          on the auspicious day, would be only good
          manners.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle was seated in her dining-room, her hands
          folded before her. It was rare indeed that
            <hi>she</hi> was caught doing nothing. She turned
          her eyes on Mr. Dill as he entered.</p>
  <p>"Why, what on earth has taken you!" began she, before he
          could speak. "You are decked out like a young
          buck."</p>
  <p>"I am going to the wedding, Miss Cornelia. Did you not
          know it? Mrs. Hare was so kind as to invite me to
          the breakfast, and Mr. Archibald insists upon my
          going to church. I am not too fine, am I?"</p>
  <p>Poor old Dill's "finery" consisted of a white waistcoat
          with gold buttons, and an embroidered shirt front.
          Miss Corny was pleased to regard it with sarcastic
          wrath.</p>
  <p>"Fine!" echoed she, "I don't know what <hi>you</hi> call
          it. I would not make myself such a spectacle for
          untold gold. You'll have all the ragamuffins in the
          street forming a tail after you, thinking you are
          the bridegroom. A man of your years to deck yourself
          out in a worked shirt! I would have had some
          rosettes on my coat-tails, while I was about
          it."</p>
  <p>"My coat's quite plain, Miss Cornelia," he meekly
          remonstrated.</p>
  <p>"Plain! what would you have it?" snapped Miss Corny.
          "Perhaps you covet a wreath of embroidery round it,
          gold leaves and scarlet flowers, with a swansdown
          collar? It would only be in keeping with that shirt
          and waistcoat. I might as well go and order a white
          tarlatan dress, looped up with sweet <pb n="253"/>
          peas, and stream through the town in that guise. It
          would be just as consistent."</p>
  <p>"People like to dress a little out of common at a
          wedding, Miss Cornelia: it's only respectful, when
          they are invited guests."</p>
  <p>"I don't say people should go to a wedding in a hop sack.
          But there's a medium. Pray do you know your
          age?"</p>
  <p>"I am turned sixty, Miss Corny."</p>
  <p>"You just are. And do you consider it decent for an old
          man, turned sixty, to be decorated off as you are
          now? I don't; and so I tell you my mind. Why, you'll
          be the laughing-stock of the parish! Take care the
          boys don't tie a tin kettle to you!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill thought he would leave the subject. His own
          impression was, that he was <hi>not</hi> too fine,
          and that the parish would not regard him as being
          so: still, he had a great reverence for Miss Corny's
          judgment, and was not altogether easy. He had had
          his white gloves in his hand when he entered, but he
          surreptitiously smuggled them into his pocket, lest
          they might offend. He passed to the subject which
          had brought him thither.</p>
  <p>"What I came in for, was, to offer you my congratulations
          on this auspicious day, Miss Cornelia. I hope Mr.
          Archibald and his wife, and you, ma'am—"</p>
  <p>"There! you need not trouble yourself to go on,"
          interrupted Miss Corny, hotly arresting him. "We
          want condolence here to-day, rather than the other
          thing. I'm sure I'd nearly as soon see Archibald go
          to his hanging."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Miss Corny!"</p>
  <p>"I would: and you need not stare at me as if you <pb n="254"/> were throttled. What business has he to
          go and fetter himself with a wife again? one would
          have thought he had had enough with the other. It is
          as I have always said; there's a soft place in
          Archibald's brain."</p>
  <p>Old Dill knew there was no "soft place" in the brain of
          Mr. Carlyle, but he deemed it might be as well not
          to say so, in Miss Corny's present humour. "Marriage
          is a happy state, as I have heard, ma'am, and
          honourable; and I am sure Mr. Archibald—"</p>
  <p>"Very happy! very honourable!" fiercely cried Miss
          Carlyle, sarcasm in her tone. "His last marriage
          brought him all that, did it not?"</p>
  <p>"That's past and done with, Miss Corny, and none of us
          need recal it. It brought him some happy years
          before that happened. I hope he will find in his
          present wife a recompense for what's gone: he could
          not have chosen a prettier or nicer young lady than
          Miss Barbara: and I am glad to my very heart that he
          has got her."</p>
  <p>"Couldn't he!" jerked Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"No, ma'am, he could not. Were I young, and wanting a
          wife, there's not one in all West Lynne I would so
          soon look out for as Miss Barbara. Not that she'd
          have me; and I was not speaking in that sense, Miss
          Corny."</p>
  <p>"It's to be hoped you were not," retorted Miss Corny.
          "She is an idle, insolent, vain fagot, caring for
          nothing but her own doll's face and for
          Archibald."</p>
  <p>"Ah, well, ma'am, never mind that: pretty young girls
          know they are pretty, and you can't take their
          vanity from them. She'll be a good and loving wife
          to him; I know she will; it is in her nature: she
          won't serve him as—as—that other poor unfortunate
          did."</p>
  <pb n="255"/>
  <p>"If I feared she was one to bring shame to him, as that
          other did, I'd go into the church this hour and
          forbid the marriage: and if that didn't do, I'd—I'd—
          smother her!" shrieked Miss Carlyle. "Look at that
          piece of impudence!"</p>
  <p>The last sentence was uttered in a different tone, and
          concerned somebody in the street. Miss Carlyle
          hopped off her chair and strode to the window. Mr.
          Dill's eyes turned in the like direction.</p>
  <p>In a gay summer's dress, fine and sparkling, with a
          coquettish little bonnet, trimmed with pink, shaded
          by one of those nondescript articles at present
          called veils, which article was made of white
          spotted net, with a pink ruche round it, sailed Afy
          Hallijohn, conceited and foolish and good-looking as
          ever. Catching sight of Mr. Dill, she made him a
          flourishing and gracious bow. The courteous old
          gentleman returned it, and was pounced upon by Miss
          Corny's tongue for his pains.</p>
  <p>"Whatever possessed you to do that?"</p>
  <p>"Well, Miss Corny, she spoke to me. You saw her."</p>
  <p>"I saw her! yes, I did see her, the brazen bell-wether!
          And she saw me, and spoke to you in her insolence.
          And you must answer her, in spite of my presence,
          instead of shaking your fist and giving her a
          reproving frown. You want a little sharp talking to,
          yourself."</p>
  <p>"But, Miss Corny, it's always best to let bygones be
          bygones," he pleaded. "She was flighty and foolish,
          and all that, was Afy; but now that it's proved she
          did not go with Richard Hare, as was suspected, and
          is at present living creditably, why should she not
          be noticed?"</p>
  <pb n="256"/>
  <p>"If the very deuce himself stood there with his horns and
          tail, you would find excuses to make for him," fired
          Miss Corny. "You are as bad as Archibald! Notice Afy
          Hallijohn! when she dresses and flirts, and minces,
          as you saw her but now! What creditable servant
          would flaunt about in such a dress and bonnet as
          that?—with that flimsy gauze thing over her face!
          It's as disreputable as your shirt-front."</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill coughed humbly, not wishing to renew the point
          of the shirt-front. "She is not exactly a servant,
          Miss Corny, she's a lady's-maid: and ladies'-maids
          dress outrageously fine. I had a great respect for
          her father, ma'am: never a better clerk came into
          our office."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps you'll tell me you have a respect for her! The
          world's being turned upside down, I think. Formerly,
          mistresses kept their servants to work; now, it
          seems they keep them for play. She's going to St.
          Jude's, you may be sure of it, to stare at this fine
          wedding, instead of being at home, in a cotton gown
          and white apron, making beds. Mrs. Latimer must be a
          droll mistress, to give her her liberty in this way.
          What's that fly for?" sharply added Miss Corny, as
          one drew up to the office door.</p>
  <p>"Fly," said Mr. Dill, stretching forward his bald head.
          "It must be the one I ordered. Then I'll wish you
          good day, Miss Corny."</p>
  <p>"Fly for you!" cried Miss Corny. "Have you got the gout,
          that you could not walk to St. Jude's on foot?"</p>
  <p>"I am not going to church yet, I am going on to the
          Grove, Miss Corny. I thought it would look more
          proper to have a fly, ma'am; more respectful."</p>
  <p>"Not a doubt but you need it, in that trim," retorted <pb n="257"/> she. "Why didn't you put on pumps; and
          silk stockings with pink clocks?"</p>
  <p>He was glad to bow himself out. But he thought he would
          do it with a pleasant remark, to show her he bore no
          ill will. "Just look at the crowds pouring down,
          Miss Corny: the church will be as full as it can
          cram."</p>
  <p>"I dare say it will," retorted she. "One fool makes
          many."</p>
  <p>"I fear Miss Cornelia does not like this marriage, any
          more than she did the last," quoth Mr. Dill to
          himself as he stepped into his fly. "Such a sensible
          woman as she is in other things, to be so bitter
          against Mr. Archibald because he marries! It's not
          like her. I wonder," he added, his thoughts
          changing, "whether I do look foolish in this shirt?
          I'm sure I never thought of decking myself out to
          appear young—as Miss Corny said: I only wished to
          testify respect to Mr. Archibald and Miss Barbara:
          nothing else would have made me give five-and-twenty
          shillings for it. Perhaps it's not etiquette—or
          whatever they call it—to wear them in a morning?
          Miss Corny ought to know: and there must certainly
          be something wrong about it, by the way it put her
          up. Well, it can't be helped now; it must go:
          there's no time to return home to change it."</p>
  <p>St. Jude's church was crowded: all the world and his wife
          had flocked to see it. Those who could not get in,
          took up their station in the church-yard and in the
          road. Tombstones were little respected that day, for
          irreverent feet stood upon them: five-and-twenty
          boys at least were mounted on the railings round
          Lord Mount Severn's grave, holding on, one to
          another. <pb n="258"/> Was the bridal party never
          coming? Eleven o'clock, and no signs of it. The mob
          outside grew impatient; the well-dressed mob inside
          grew impatient too: some of them had been there for
          two hours. Hark! a sound of carriages! Yes, it was
          coming now; and the beadle and the pew-opener
          cleared the space before the altar rails, which had
          been invaded, and, until now, the invasion winked
          at.</p>
  <p>Well, it was a goodly show. Ladies and gentlemen as smart
          as fine feathers could make them. Mr. Carlyle was
          one of the first to enter the church, self-possessed
          and calm, every inch a gentleman. Oh! but he was
          noble to look upon: though when was he ever
          otherwise? Mr. and Mrs. Clitheroe were there, Anne
          Hare, that was: a surprise for some of the gazers,
          who had not known they were expected to the wedding.
          Gentle, delicate Mrs. Hare walked up the church
          leaning on the arm of Sir John Dobede, a paler look
          than usual on her sweet, sad face. "She's thinking
          of her wretched, ill-doing son," quoth the gossips,
          one to another. But who comes in now, with an air as
          if the whole church belonged to him? An imposing,
          pompous man, stern and grim, in a new flaxen wig,
          and a white rose in his button-hole. It is Mr.
          Justice Hare, and he leads in one, whom folks jump
          upon seats to get a look at.</p>
  <p>Very lovely was Barbara, in her soft white silk robes,
          and her floating veil. Her cheeks, now blushing rosy
          red, now pale as the veil that shaded them, betrayed
          how intense was her emotion. The bridesmaids came
          after her with jaunty steps, vain in their important
          office: Louisa Dobede, Augusta and Kate Herbert, and
          Mary Pinner.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was already in his place at the altar; and
            <pb n="259"/> as Barbara neared him, he advanced,
          took her hand and placed her on his left. I don't
          think that it was quite usual: but he had been
          married before, and ought to know. The clerk
          directed the rest where to stand, and, after some
          little delay, the service proceeded.</p>
  <p>In spite of her emotion—and that it was great, scarcely
          to be repressed, none could doubt—Barbara made the
          responses bravely. Be you very sure that a woman who
            <hi>loves</hi> him to whom she is being united,
          must experience this emotion. "Wilt thou have this
          man to thy wedded husband, to live together after
          God's ordinance in the holy state of matrimony?"
          spoke the Reverend Mr. Little. "Wilt thou obey him,
          and serve him, love, honour, and keep him in
          sickness and in health; and, forsaking all others,
          keep thee only unto him, as long as ye both shall
          live?"</p>
  <p>"I will." Clearly, firmly, impressively was the answer
          given. It was as if Barbara had in her thoughts one,
          who had not "kept only unto him," and would proclaim
          her own resolution never so to betray him, God
          helping her.</p>
  <p>The ceremony was very soon over; and Barbara, the magic
          ring upon her finger, and her arm within Mr.
          Carlyle's, was led out to his chariot, now hers: had
          he not just endowed her with his worldly goods?</p>
  <p>The crowd shouted and hurraed as they caught a sight of
          her lovely face, but the carriage was soon clear of
          the crowd, who concentrated their curiosity upon the
          other carriages that were to follow it. The company
          were speeding back to the Grove, to breakfast. Mr
          Carlyle, breaking the silence, suddenly turned to
          his bride and spoke, his tone impassioned, almost
          unto pain.</p>
  <pb n="260"/>
  <p>"Barbara, <hi>you</hi> will keep your vows to me?"</p>
  <p>She raised her shy blue eyes, so full of love, to his:
          earnest feeling had brought the tears to them.</p>
  <p>"Always: in the spirit and in the letter: until death
          shall claim me. So help me Heaven!"</p>

  <head>CHAPTER I. STALKENBERG.</head>
  <p><hi>More</hi> than a year had gone on.</p>
  <p>The German watering-places were crowded that early
          autumn. They generally are crowded at that season,
          now that the English flock abroad in shoals, like
          the swallows quiting our cold country, to return
          again some time. France has been pretty well used
          up, so now we fall upon Germany. Stalkenberg was
          that year particularly full; for its size: you might
          have put it in a nutshell: and it derived its
          importance, name, and most else belonging to it,
          from its lord of the soil, the Baron von
          Stalkenberg. A stalwart old man was the baron, with
          grizzly hair, a grizzly beard, and manners as
          loutish as those of the boars he hunted. He had four
          sons as stalwart as himself, and who promised to be
          in time as grizzled. They were all styled the Counts
          von Stalkenberg, being distinguished by their
          christian names; all save the eldest son, and he was
          generally called the young baron. Two of them were
          away; soldiers; and two, the eldest and the
          youngest, lived with their father, in the
          tumble-down castle of Stalkenberg, situated about a
          mile from the village to which <pb n="262"/> it gave
          its name. The young Baron von Stalkenberg was at
          liberty to marry; the three Counts von Stalkenberg
          were not—unless they could pick up a wife with
          enough money to keep herself and her husband. In
          this creed they had been brought up: it was a
          perfectly understood creed, and not rebelled
          against.</p>
  <p>Stalkenberg differed in no wise from the other baths of
          its class in the Vaterland. It had its linden-trees,
          its fair scenery, its Kursaal, its balls, its
          concerts, its tables d'hôte, its gaming tables,
          where one everlasting sentence dins the visitor's
          ear—and one to which he will do well to be
          deaf—"Faites votre jeu, messieurs; faites votre
          jeu," its promenades, and its waters. The last were
          advertised—and some accorded their belief—to cure
          every malady known or imagined, from apoplexy down
          to an attack of love-fever, provided you only took
          enough of them.</p>
  <p>The young Baron von Stalkenberg (who was only styled
          young in contradistinction to his father, being in
          his forty-first year) was famous for a handsome
          person, and for his passionate love of the chase: he
          was the deadly enemy of wild boars and wolves. The
          Count Otto von Stalkenberg (eleven years his
          brother's junior) was famous for nothing but his
          fiercely-ringed moustache, a habit of eating, and an
          undue addition to draughts of Marcobrunnen. Somewhat
          meagre fare, so report ran, was the fashion in the
          castle of Stalkenberg; neither the old baron nor his
          heir cared for luxury; therefore Count Otto was sure
          to be seen at the table d'hôte, as often as anybody
          would invite him. And that was nearly every day: for
          the Count von Stalkenberg was a high-sounding title,
          and his baronial father, proprietor of all
          Stalkenberg, lorded it in the <pb n="263"/> baronial
          castle close by; all of which appeared very grand
          and great; and that is bowed down to with an idol's
          worship.</p>
  <p>Stopping at the Ludwig Bad, the chief hotel in the place,
          was a family of the name of Crosby. It consisted of
          Mr. and Mrs. Crosby, an only daughter, her
          governess, and two or three servants. What Mr.
          Crosby had done to England, or England to him, I
          can't say: but he never went near his native
          country. For years and years he had lived abroad:
          not in any settled place of residence: they would
          travel about, and remain a year or two in one place,
          a year or two in another, as the whim suited them. A
          respectable, portly man, of quiet and gentleman-like
          manners, looking as little like one who need be
          afraid of the laws of his own land, as can be.
          Neither is it said, or insinuated, that he was
          afraid of them: a gentleman who knew him, had
          asserted, many years before, when it was once
          questioned, that Crosby was as free to go home and
          establish himself in a mansion in Piccadilly, as the
          best of them. But he had lost fearfully by some
          roguish scheme, like the South Sea Bubble, and could
          not live in the style he once had done, and
          therefore preferred to remain abroad. Mrs. Crosby
          was a pleasant, chatty woman, given to take as much
          gaiety as she could get, and Helena Crosby was a
          remarkably fine-grown girl of seventeen. You might
          have given her some years more, had you been
          guessing her age, for she was no child, either in
          appearance or manners, and never had been. She was
          an heiress, too: an uncle had left her twenty
          thousand pounds: and, at her mother's death, she
          would have ten thousand more. The Count Otto von
          Stalkenberg heard of the thirty thousand pounds, <pb n="264"/> and turned his fierce moustache and his
          eyes on Miss Helena.</p>
  <p>"Tirty tousand pound and von handsome girls!" cogitated
          he, for he prided himself upon his English. "It is
          just what I have been seeking after."</p>
  <p>He found the rumour, touching her fortune, to be correct,
          and from that time was seldom apart from the
          Crosbys. They were as pleased to have his society as
          he was to be in theirs, for was he not the Count von
          Stalkenberg?—and the other visitors at Stalkenberg,
          looking on with envy, would have given their ears to
          be honoured with a like intimacy. Whether Mr. Crosby
          cared so much for the distinction as did madame and
          mademoiselle, must remain a question; he was civil
          to him, and made him welcome; and Mrs. Crosby, in
          all things relating to society, was the grey
          mare.</p>
  <p>One day there thundered down in a vehicle the old Baron
          von Stalkenberg. The like of this conveyance, for
          its shape and its silver ornaments, had never been
          seen since the days of Adam. It had been the pride
          of the baron's forefathers, but was rarely disturbed
          in its repose now. Some jägers in green and silver
          attended it, and it drew up at the door of the
          Ludwig Bad, the whole of whose inmates thereupon
          flocked to the windows to feast their eyes. The old
          chief had come to pay a visit of ceremony to the
          Crosbys: and the host of the Ludwig Bad, as he
          appeared himself to marshal his chieftain to their
          saloon, bowed his body low with every step: "Room
          there, room there, for the mighty Baron von
          Stalkenberg."</p>
  <p>The mighty baron had come to invite them to a feast at
          his castle—where no feast had ever been made so
          grand before, as this would be; and Otto had
            <hi>carte</hi>
          <pb n="265"/>
          <hi>blanche</hi> to engage other distinguished
          sojourners at Stalkenberg, English, French, and
          natives, who had been civil to him. Mrs. Crosby's
          head was turned.</p>
  <p>And now, I ask you, knowing as you do our national
          notions, was it not enough to turn it? You will not,
          then, be surprised to hear that when, some days
          subsequent to the feast, the Count Otto von
          Stalkenberg laid his proposals at Helena's feet,
          they were not rejected.</p>
  <p>"But she is so young," remonstrated Mr. Crosby to his
          wife. "If they would only wait a couple of years, I
          would say nothing against it."</p>
  <p>"And get the count snapped up meanwhile. No, no, Mr.
          Crosby. Counts von Stalkenberg are not secured every
          day."</p>
  <p>"If he has a title and ancestry, Helena has money."</p>
  <p>"Then they are pretty equally balanced," returned Mrs.
          Crosby. "I never thought of looking for such a match
          for her: the Countess von Stalkenberg; only listen
          to the sound!"</p>
  <p>"I wish he would cut off those frightful moustaches,"
          grumbled Mr. Crosby.</p>
  <p>"Now don't worry about minor details: Helena thinks they
          are divine. The worst is about the governess."</p>
  <p>"What about her?"</p>
  <p>"Why, I engaged her, for certain, up to Christmas, and of
          course I must pay her. Unless I can get her another
          place: I'll try."</p>
  <p>"Ah! Helena would be much better with her, than getting
          married. I don't like girls to marry so young,"
          lamented Mr. Crosby. "I don't know what the English
          here will say to it!"</p>
  <p>"If you don't let out her age, nobody need know it,"
          cried his wife. "Helena looks a woman, not a child.
            <pb n="266"/> As to the English, they are going
          mad that the luck has not fallen upon them."</p>
  <p>Mr. Crosby's objections seemed to be met in every way, so
          he relapsed into silence. He knew it was of no use
          carrying on the war.</p>
  <p>Helena Crosby, meanwhile, had rushed into her governess's
          room. "Madame! madame! only think! I am going to be
          married!"</p>
  <p>Madame lifted her pale, sad face: a very sad and pale
          face was hers. "Indeed!" she gently replied.</p>
  <p>"And my studies are to be over from to-day. Mamma says
          so."</p>
  <p>"You are over young to marry, Helena."</p>
  <p>"Now, don't bring up that, madame. It is just what papa
          is harping upon," returned Miss Helena.</p>
  <p>"Is it to Count Otto?" asked the governess. And it may be
          remarked that her English accent was perfect,
          although the young lady addressed her as
          "Madame."</p>
  <p>"Count Otto, of course. As if I would marry anybody
          else!"</p>
  <p>Look at the governess, reader, and see whether you know
          her. You will say No. But you do, for it is Lady
          Isabel Vane. But how strangely she is altered! Yes;
          the railway accident did that for her: and what the
          accident left undone, grief and remorse
          accomplished. She limps slightly as she walks, and
          stoops, which takes from her former height. A scar
          extends from her chin above her mouth, completely
          changing the character of the lower part of her
          face, some of her teeth are missing, so that she
          speaks with a lisp, and the sober bands of her grey
          hair—it is nearly silver— are confined under a large
          and close cap. She herself tries to make the change
          greater, that the chance of being <pb n="267"/>
          recognised may be at an end, for which reason she
          wears disfiguring green spectacles, or, as they are
          called, preservers, going round the eyes, and a
          broad band of grey velvet coming down low upon her
          forehead. Her dress, too, is equally disfiguring.
          Never is she seen in one that fits her person, but
          in those frightful "loose jackets," which must
          surely have been invented by somebody envious of a
          pretty shape. As to her bonnet, it would put to
          shame those masquerade things tilted on to the back
          of the head, for it actually shaded her face; and
          she was never seen out of doors without a thick
          veil. She was pretty easy upon the score of being
          recognised now: for Mrs. Ducie and her daughters had
          been sojourning at Stalkenberg, and they did not
          know her in the least. Who could know her? What
          resemblance was there between that grey, broken-down
          woman, with her disfiguring marks, and the once
          lovely Lady Isabel, with her bright colour, her
          beauty, her dark flowing curls, and her agile
          figure? Mr. Carlyle himself would not have known
          her. But she was good-looking still, in spite of it
          all, gentle, and interesting; and people wondered to
          see that grey hair on one, yet young.</p>
  <p>She had been with the Crosbys nearly two years. After her
          recovery from the railway accident, she removed to a
          quiet town in its vicinity, where they were living,
          and she became daily governess to Helena. The
          Crosbys were given to understand that she was
          English, but the widow of a Frenchman—she was
          obliged to offer some plausible account. There were
          no references; but she so won upon their esteem as
          the daily governess, that they soon took her into
          the house: had Lady Isabel surmised that they would
          be travelling to so conspicuous a spot as an
          English-frequented German <pb n="268"/>
          watering-place, she might have hesitated to accept
          the engagement. However, it had been of service to
          her; the meeting with Mrs. Ducie proving that she
          was altered beyond chance of recognition. She could
          go anywhere now.</p>
  <p>But now, about her state of mind? I do not know how to
          describe the vain yearning, the inward fever, the
          restless longing for what might not be. Longing for
          what? For her children. Let a mother, be she a
          duchess, or be she an apple-woman at a standing, be
          separated for a while from her little children: let
            <hi>her</hi> answer how she yearns for them. She
          may be away on a tour of pleasure: for a few weeks,
          the longing to see their little faces again, to hear
          their prattling tongues, to feel their soft kisses,
          is kept under; and there may be frequent messages,
          "The children's dear love to mamma:" but, as the
          weeks lengthen out, the desire to see them again
          becomes almost irrepressible. What must it have
          been, then, for Lady Isabel, who had endured this
          longing for years? Talk of the <hi>mal du pays</hi>
          , which is said to attack the Swiss when exiled from
          their country, that is as nothing compared to the
          heart-sickness which clung to Lady Isabel. She had
          passionately loved her children; she had been
          anxious for their welfare in all ways: and, not the
          least that she had to endure now, was the thought
          that she had abandoned them to be trained by
          strangers. Would they be trained to goodness, to
          morality, to religion? Careless as she herself had
          once been upon these points, she had learnt better
          now. Would Isabel grow up to indifference,
          to—perhaps do as she had done? Lady Isabel flung her
          hands before her eyes, and groaned in anguish.</p>
  <p>Of late, the longing had become intense. It was <pb n="269"/> indeed a very fever; and a fever of the
          worst kind, for it attacked both the mind and body.
          Her pale lips were constantly parched: her throat
          had that malady in it, which those, who have
          suffered from some hideous burden, know only too
          well. She had never heard a syllable of, or from
          East Lynne since that visit of Lord Mount Severn's
          to Grenoble, nearly three years ago. An English
          newspaper never came in her way. Mr. Crosby
          sometimes had them, but they were not sent up to the
          governess: and, as Lady Isabel would say to herself,
          what should there be about East Lynne in a
          newspaper? She might have asked Mrs. Ducie for news,
          but she did not dare: what excuse could <hi>she</hi>
          , Madame Vine, make, for wishing tidings of East
          Lynne. For all she knew, Mr. Carlyle and the
          children might be dead and buried. Oh! that she
          could see her children but for a day, an hour! that
          she might press one kiss upon their lips! Could she
          live without it? News, however, she was soon to
          have.</p>
  <p>It happened that Mrs. Latimer, a lady living at West
          Lynne, betook herself about that time to
          Stalkenberg: and, with her, three parts maid and one
          part companion, went Afy Hallijohn. Not that Afy was
          admitted to the society of Mrs. Latimer, to sit with
          her or dine with her, nothing of that; but she did
          enjoy more privileges than most ladies'-maids; and
          Afy, who was never backward at setting off her own
          consequence, gave out that she was "companion." Mrs.
          Latimer was an easy woman, fond of Afy; and Afy had
          made her own tale good to her, respecting the
          ill-natured reports at the time of the murder, so
          that Mrs. Latimer looked upon her as one to be
          compassionated.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Latimer and Mrs. Crosby, whose apartments in <pb n="270"/> the hotel adjoined, struck up a violent
          friendship, the one for the other. Ere the former
          had been a week at the Ludwig, they had sworn
          something like eternal sisterhood—as both had
          probably done for others fifty times before.</p>
  <p>On the evening of the day Helena Crosby communicated her
          future prospects to Lady Isabel, the latter strolled
          out in the twilight and took her seat on a bench in
          an unfrequented part of the gardens, where she was
          fond of sitting. Now it came to pass that Afy, some
          few minutes afterwards, found herself in the same
          walk —and a very dull one too, she was thinking.</p>
  <p>"Who's that?" quoth Afy to herself, her eyes falling upon
          Lady Isabel. "Oh, it's that governess of the
          Crosbys. She may be known, a mile off, by her
          grandmother's bonnet. I'll go and have a chat with
          her."</p>
  <p>Accordingly Afy, who was never troubled with bashfulness,
          went up and seated herself beside Lady Isabel. "Good
          evening, Madame Vine," cried she.</p>
  <p>"Good evening," replied Lady Isabel, courteously, not
          having the least idea of whom Afy might be.</p>
  <p>"You don't know me, I fancy," pursued Afy, so gathering
          from Lady Isabel's looks. "I am companion to Mrs.
          Latimer; and she is spending the evening with Mrs.
          Crosby. Precious dull, this Stalkenberg!"</p>
  <p>"Do you think so?"</p>
  <p>"It is for me. I can't speak German or French, and the
          upper attendants of families here can't, most of
          them, speak English. I'm sure I go about like an
          owl, able to do nothing but stare. I was sick enough
          to come here, but I'd rather be back at West Lynne,
          quiet as it is."</p>
  <pb n="271"/>
  <p>Lady Isabel had not been encouraging her companion,
          either by words or manner, but the last sentence
          caused her heart to bound within her. Control
          herself as she would, she could not quite hide her
          feverish interest.</p>
  <p>"Do you come from West Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. Horrid place! Mrs. Latimer took a house there soon
          after I went to live with her. I'd rather she had
          taken it at Botany Bay."</p>
  <p>"Why do you not like it?"</p>
  <p>"Because I don't," was Afy's satisfactory answer.</p>
  <p>"Do you know East Lynne?" resumed Lady Isabel, her heart
          beating and her brain whirling, as she deliberated
          how she could put all the questions she wished to
          ask.</p>
  <p>"I ought to know it," returned Afy. "My own sister, Miss
          Hallijohn, is head maid there. Why? do you know it,
          Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel hesitated: she was deliberating upon her
          answer. "Some years ago, I was staying in the
          neighbourhood for a little time," she said. "I
          should like to hear of the Carlyles again: they were
          a nice family."</p>
  <p>Afy tossed her head. "Ah! but there have been changes
          since that. I dare say you knew them in the time of
          Lady Isabel?"</p>
  <p>Another pause. "Lady Isabel? Yes. She was Mr. Carlyle's
          wife."</p>
  <p>"And a nice wife she made him!" ironically rejoined Afy.
          "You must have heard of it, Madame Vine, unless you
          have lived in a wood. She eloped: abandoned him and
          her children."</p>
  <p>"Are the children living?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, poor things. But the one's on its road to <pb n="272"/> consumption—if ever I saw consumption
          yet. Joyce —that's my sister—is in a flaring temper
          with me when I say it. She thinks it will get strong
          again."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel passed her handkerchief across her moist
          brow. "Which of the children is it?" she faintly
          asked. "Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"Isabel!" retorted Afy, "Who's Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"The eldest child, I mean; Miss Isabel Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"There's no Isabel. There's Lucy. She's the only
          daughter."</p>
  <p>"When—when—I knew them, there was only one daughter; the
          other two were boys: I remember quite well that she
          was called Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Stay," said Afy; "now you speak of it, what was it that
          I heard? It was Wilson told me, I recollect— she's
          the nurse. Why, the very night that his wife went
          away, Mr. Carlyle gave orders that the child in
          future should be called Lucy; her second name. No
          wonder," added Afy, violently indignant, "that he
          could no longer endure the sound of her mother's, or
          suffer the child to bear it."</p>
  <p>"No wonder," murmured Lady Isabel. "Which child is it
          that is ill?"</p>
  <p>"It's William, the eldest boy. He is not to say ill, but
          he is as thin as a herring, with an unnaturally
          bright look on his cheeks, and a glaze upon his
          eyes. Joyce says his cheeks are no brighter than his
          mother's used to be, but I know better. Folks in
          health don't have those brilliant colours."</p>
  <p>"Did you ever see Lady Isabel?" she asked, in a low
          tone.</p>
  <p>"Not I," returned Afy; "I should have thought it
          demeaning. One does not care to be brought into <pb n="273"/> contact with that sort of misdoing lot,
          you know, Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>"There was another one, a little boy, Archibald, I think
          his name was. Is he well?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, the troublesome youngster! he is as sturdy as a
          Turk. No fear of his going into a consumption. He is
          the very image of Mr. Carlyle, is that child. I say,
          though, madame," continued Afy, changing the subject
          unceremoniously, "if you were stopping at West
          Lynne, perhaps you heard some wicked mischief-making
          stories concerning me?"</p>
  <p>"I believe I did hear your name mentioned. I I cannot
          charge my memory now with the particulars."</p>
  <p>"My father was murdered—you must have heard of that?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I recollect so far."</p>
  <p>"He was murdered by a chap called Richard Hare, who
          decamped instanter. Perhaps you knew the Hares also?
          Well, directly after the funeral I left West Lynne;
          I could not bear the place; and I stopped away. And
          what do you suppose they said of me?—that I had gone
          after Richard Hare. Not that I knew they were saying
          it: or I should pretty soon have been back and given
          them the length of my tongue But now, I just ask
          you, as a lady, Madame Vine, whether a more infamous
          accusation was ever pitched upon?"</p>
  <p>"And you had not gone after him?"</p>
  <p>"No: that I swear," passionately returned Afy. "Make
          myself a companion of my father's murderer! If Mr.
          Calcraft the hangman finished off a few of those
          West Lynne scandal-mongers, it might be a warning to
          the others. I said so to Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <pb n="274"/>
  <p>"To Mr. Carlyle," repeated Lady Isabel, hardly conscious
          that she did repeat it.</p>
  <p>"He laughed I remember, and said that would not stop the
          scandal. The only one who did not misjudge me was
          himself: he did not believe that I was with Richard
          Hare: but he was ever noble-judging, was Mr.
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"I suppose you were in a situation?"</p>
  <p>Afy coughed. "To be sure. More than one. I lived as
          companion with an old lady who so valued me that she
          left me a handsome legacy in her will. I lived two
          years with the Countess Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"With the Countess of Mount Severn!" echoed Lady Isabel,
          surprised into the remark. "Why, she— she—was
          related to Mr. Carlyle's wife. At least Lord Mount
          Severn was."</p>
  <p>"Of course: everybody knows that. I was living there at
          the time the business happened. Didn't the countess
          call Lady Isabel to pieces! She and Miss Levison
          used to sit, cant cant, all day over it. Oh, I
          assure you I know all about it. Have you got the
          headache, that you are leaning on your hand?"</p>
  <p>"Headache and heartache both," she might have answered.
          Miss Afy resumed.</p>
  <p>"So, after the flattering compliment West Lynne had paid
          me, you may judge I was in no hurry to go back to
          it, Madame Vine. And if I had not found that Mrs.
          Latimer's promised to be an excellent place, I
          should have left it, rather than be marshalled
          there. But I have lived it down: I should like to
          hear any of them fibbing against me now. Do you know
          that blessed Miss Corny?"</p>
  <p>"I have seen her."</p>
  <p>"She shakes her head and makes eyes at me still. <pb n="275"/> But so she would at an angel: a
          cross-grained old cockatoo!"</p>
  <p>"Is she still at East Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"Not she, indeed. There would be drawn battles between
          her and Mrs. Carlyle, if she were."</p>
  <p>"A dart, as of an ice-bolt, seemed to arrest the blood in
          Lady Isabel's veins. "Mrs. Carlyle?" she faltered.
          "Who is Mrs. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle's wife. Who should she be?"</p>
  <p>The rushing blood leaped on now, fast and fiery. "I did
          not know he had married again."</p>
  <p>"He has been married now—getting on for fifteen months: a
          twelvemonth last June. I went to the church to see
          them married. Wasn't there a cram! She looked
          beautiful that day."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel laid her hand upon her beating heart. But for
          that delectable "loose jacket," Afy might have
          detected her bosom's rise and fall. She steadied her
          voice sufficiently to speak.</p>
  <p>"Did he marry Barbara Hare?"</p>
  <p>"You may take your oath of that," said Afy. "If folks
          tell true, there were love scenes between them
          before he ever thought of Lady Isabel. I had that
          from Wilson, and she ought to know, for she lived at
          the Hares'. Another thing is said—only you must just
          believe one word of West Lynne talk, and disbelieve
          ten: that if Lady Isabel had not died, Mr. Carlyle
          never would have married again: he had scruples.
          Half a dozen were given to him by report: Louisa
          Dobede for one, and Mary Pinner for another. Such
          nonsense! folks might have made sure it would be
          Barbara Hare. There's a baby now."</p>
  <p>"Is there?" was the faint answer.</p>
  <pb n="276"/>
  <p>"A beautiful boy, three or four months old. Mrs. Carlyle
          is not a little proud of him. She worships her
          husband."</p>
  <p>"Is she kind to the first children?"</p>
  <p>"For all I know. I don't think she has much to do with
          them. Archibald is in the nursery, and the other two
          are mostly with the governess."</p>
  <p>"There is a governess?"</p>
  <p>"Nearly the first thing that Mr. Carlyle did, after his
          wife's moonlight flitting, was to seek a governess,
          and she has been there ever since. She is going to
          leave now: to be married, Joyce told me."</p>
  <p>"Are you much at East Lynne?"</p>
  <p>Afy shook her head. "I am not going much, I can tell you,
          where I am looked down upon. Mrs. Carlyle does not
          favour me. She knew that her brother Richard would
          have given his head to marry me, and she resents it.
          No such great catch, I'm sure, that Dick Hare, even
          if he had gone on right," continued Afy, somewhat
          after the example of the fox, looking at the
          unattainable grapes. "He had no brains, to speak of;
          and what he had were the colour of a peacock's
          tail—green. Ah me! the changes that take place in
          this world! But for that Lady Isabel's mad folly in
          quitting him, and leaving the field open, Miss
          Barbara would never have had the chance of being
          Mrs. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel groaned in spirit.</p>
  <p>"There's one person who never will hear a word breathed
          against her, and that's Joyce," went on Afy. "She
          was as fond of Lady Isabel, nearly, as Mr. Carlyle
          was."</p>
  <p>"Was he so fond of her?"</p>
  <p>"He worshipped the very ground she trod upon. <pb n="277"/> Ay, up to the hour of her departure; Joyce says
          she knows he did: and that's how she repaid him. But
          it's sure to be the way, in this world: let a man,
          or woman, make an idol of another, and see if they
          don't get served out. The night that Mr. Carlyle
          brought his new wife home, Joyce, who was attending
          on her, went into the dressing-room, leaving Mrs.
          Carlyle in the bed-chamber. 'Joyce,' she called out.
          'My lady?' answered Joyce—proving who was filling up
          her thoughts. I don't know how Mrs. Carlyle liked
          it. Joyce said she felt as mad as could be with
          herself."</p>
  <p>"I wonder," cried Lady Isabel, in a low tone, "how the
          tidings of her death were received at East
          Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know anything about that. They held it as a
          jubilee, I should say, and set all the bells in the
          town to ring, and feasted the men upon legs of
          mutton and onion sauce afterwards. <hi>I</hi>
          should, I know. A brute animal, deaf and dumb clings
          to its offspring: but <hi>she</hi> abandoned hers.
          Are you going in, Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>"I must go in now. Good evening to you."</p>
  <p>She had sat till she could sit no longer; her very
          heart-strings were wrung. And she might not rise up
          in defence of herself. Defence? Did she not deserve
          more, ten thousand times more reproach than had met
          her ears now? This girl did not say of her half what
          the world must say.</p>
  <p>To bed at the usual time, but not to sleep. What she had
          heard only increased her vain, insensate longing. A
          stepmother at East Lynne, and one of her children
          gliding on to death! Oh! to be with them! <pb n="278"/> to see them once again! To purchase that
          boon, she would willingly forfeit all the rest of
          her existence.</p>
  <p>Her frame was fevered; the bed was fevered; and she rose
          and paced the room. This state of mind would
          inevitably bring on bodily illness, possibly an
          attack of the brain. She dreaded that; for there was
          no telling what she might reveal in her delirium.
          Her temples were throbbing, her heart was beating;
          and she once more threw herself upon the bed, and
          pressed the pillow down upon her forehead. There is
          no doubt that the news of Mr. Carlyle's marriage
          helped greatly the excitement. She did not pray to
          die; but she did wish that death might come to
          her.</p>
  <p>What would have been the ending it is impossible to say,
          but a strange turn in affairs came: one of those
          wonderful coincidences which are sometimes, but not
          often, to be met with. Mrs. Crosby appeared in
          Madame Vine's room after breakfast, and gave her an
          account of Helena's projected marriage. She then
          apologized, (the real object of her visit) for
          dispensing so summarily with madame's services, but
          she had reason to hope that she could introduce her
          to another situation. Would madame have any
          objection to take one in England? Madame was upon
          the point of replying that she did not choose to
          enter one in England, when Mrs. Crosby stopped her,
          saying she would call in Mrs. Latimer, who could
          tell her about it better than she could.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Latimer came in, all eagerness and volubility. "Ah,
          my dear madame," she exclaimed, "you would be
          fortunate indeed if you were to get into this
          family. They are the nicest people, he so liked and
          respected; she so pretty and engaging. A most
          desirable situation. <pb n="279"/> You will be
          treated as a lady, and have all things comfortable.
          There is only one pupil, a girl; one of the little
          boys, I believe, goes in for an hour or two, but
          that is not much: and the salary is seventy guineas.
          The Carlyles are friends of mine; they live at a
          beautiful place, East Lynne."</p>
  <p>The Carlyles! East Lynne! Go governess there? Lady
          Isabel's breath was taken away.</p>
  <p>"They are parting with their governess," continued Mrs.
          Latimer, "and, when I was there, a day or two before
          I started on my tour to Germany, Mrs. Carlyle said
          to me, 'I suppose you could not pick us up a
          desirable governess for Lucy: one who is mistress of
          French and German.' She spoke in a half-joking tone,
          but I feel sure that were I to write word that I
            <hi>had</hi> found one, it would give her
          pleasure. Now, Mrs. Crosby tells me your French is
          quite that of a native, Madame Vine, that you read
          and speak German well, and that your musical
          abilities are excellent. I think you would be just
          the one to suit: and I have no doubt I could get you
          the situation. What do you say?"</p>
  <p>What could she say? Her brain was in a whirl.</p>
  <p>"I am anxious to find you one if I can," put in Mrs.
          Crosby. "We have been very much pleased with you,
          and I should like you to be desirably placed. As
          Mrs. Latimer is so kind as to interest herself, it
          appears to me an opportunity that should not be
          missed."</p>
  <p>"Shall I write to Mrs. Carlyle?" rejoined Mrs.
          Latimer.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel roused herself, and so far cleared her
          intellects as to understand and answer the question.
          "Perhaps you will kindly give me until to-morrow <pb n="280"/> morning to consider of it? I had not
          intended to take a situation in England."</p>
  <p>She had a battle with herself that day. Now resolving to
          go, and risk it; now shrinking from the attempt. At
          one moment it seemed to her that Providence must
          have placed this opportunity in her way that she
          might see her children, in her desperate longing; at
          another, a voice appeared to whisper that it was a
          wily, dangerous temptation flung across her path,
          one which it was her duty to resist and flee from.
          Then came another phase of the picture—how should
          she bear to see Mr. Carlyle the husband of
          another?—to live in the same house with them, to
          witness his attentions, possibly his caresses? It
          might be difficult; but she could force and school
          her heart to endurance: had she not resolved in her
          first bitter repentance, to <hi>take up her
            cross</hi> daily, and bear it? No; her own
          feelings, let them be wrung as they would, should
          not prove the obstacle.</p>
  <p>Evening came, and she had not decided. She passed another
          night of pain, of restlessness, of longing for her
          children: this intense longing appeared to be
          over-mastering all her powers of mind and body. The
          temptation at length proved too strong: the project,
          having been placed before her covetous eyes, could
          not be relinquished, and she finally resolved <hi>to
            go</hi> . "What is it that should keep me away?"
          she argued. "The dread of discovery? Well, if that
          comes, it must: they could not hang me, or kill me.
          Deeper humiliation, than ever, would be my portion
          when they drive me from East Lynne with abhorrence
          and ignominy, as a soldier is drummed out of his
          regiment; but I could bear that, as I must bear the
          rest, and I can shrink <pb n="281"/> under some
          hedge and lay myself down to die. Humiliation for
          me! no; I will not put that in comparison with
          seeing and being with my children."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Latimer wrote to Mrs. Carlyle. She had met with a
          governess; one desirable in every way, who could not
          fail to suit her views precisely. She was a Madame
          Vine, English by birth, but the widow of a
          Frenchman: a Protestant, a thorough gentlewoman, an
          efficient linguist and musician, and competent to
          her duties in all ways. Mrs. Crosby, with whom she
          had lived two years, regarded her as a treasure, and
          would not have parted with her but for Helena's
          marriage with a German nobleman. "You must not mind
          her appearance," went on the letter. "She is the
          oddest-looking person: wears spectacles, caps,
          enormous bonnets, and has a great scar on her mouth
          and chin; and though she can't be more than thirty,
          her hair is grey: she is also slightly lame. But,
          understand you, she is a <hi>gentlewoman</hi> with
          it all; and looks one."</p>
  <p>When this description reached East Lynne, Barbara laughed
          as she read it aloud to Mr. Carlyle. He laughed
          also.</p>
  <p>"It is well governesses are not chosen according to their
          looks," he said, "or I fear Madame Vine would stand
          but a poor chance."</p>
  <p>They resolved to engage her. And word went back to that
          effect.</p>
  <p>A strangely wild tumult filled Lady Isabel's bosom. She
          first of all hunted her luggage over, her desk,
          everything belonging to her, lest any scrap of
          paper, any mark on linen might be there, which could
          give a clue to her former self. The bulk of her
          luggage remained at Paris, warehoused, where it had
          been sent <pb n="282"/> ere she quitted Grenoble.
          She next saw to her wardrobe, making it still more
          unlike anything she had formerly worn: her caps,
          save that they were simple, and fitted closely to
          the face, nearly rivalled those of Miss Carlyle. She
          had been striving for two years to change the
          character of her handwriting, and had so far
          succeeded that none would now take it for Lady
          Isabel Vane's. But her hand shook when she wrote to
          Mrs. Carlyle—who had written to her. She—
            <hi>she</hi> writing to Mr. Carlyle's wife! and in
          the capacity of a subordinate! How would she like to
          live with her as a subordinate? —a servant, it may
          be said—where she had once reigned, the idolised
          lady? She must bear that; as she must bear all else.
          Hot tears came into her eyes, with a gush, as they
          fell on the signature "Barbara Carlyle."</p>
  <p>All ready, she sat down and waited the signal of
          departure: but that was not to be yet. It was
          finally arranged that she should travel to England
          and to West Lynne with Mrs. Latimer, and that lady
          would not return until October. Lady Isabel could
          only fold her hands and strive for patience.</p>
  <p>But the day came at last; and Mrs. Latimer, Lady Isabel,
          and Afy quitted Stalkenberg. Mrs. Latimer would only
          travel slowly, and the impatient, fevered woman
          thought the journey would never end.</p>
  <p>"You have been informed, I think, of the position of
          these unhappy children to whom you are going," Mrs.
          Latimer said one day. "You must not speak to them of
          their mother. She left them."</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"It is never well to speak to children of a mother who
          has disgraced them. Mr. Carlyle would not like it.
            <pb n="283"/> And I dare say they are taught to
          forget her, to regard Mrs. Carlyle as their only
          mother."</p>
  <p>Her aching heart had to assent to all.</p>
  <p>It was a foggy afternoon, grey with the coming twilight,
          when they arrived at West Lynne. Mrs. Latimer,
          believing the governess was a novice in England,
          kindly put her into a fly, and told the driver his
          destination. "Au revoir, madame," she said, "and
          good luck to you!"</p>
  <p>Once more she was whirling along the familiar road. She
          saw Justice Hare's house, she saw other marks which
          she knew well. And once more she saw <hi>East
            Lynne</hi> , the dear old house, for the fly had
          turned into the avenue. Lights were moving in the
          windows, it looked gay and cheerful, a contrast to
          her. Her heart was sick with expectation, her throat
          was beating; and as the man thundered up with all
          the force of his one horse, and halted at the steps,
          her sight momentarily left her. Would Mr. Carlyle
          come to the fly to hand her out? She wished she had
          never undertaken the project, now, in the depth of
          her fear and agitation. The hall door was flung
          open, and there gushed forth a blaze of light.</p>
  <pb n="284"/>
                                </div>
                                <div type="chapter">
  <head>CHAPTER II. CHANGE AND CHANGE.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> hall doors of East Lynne were thrown open,
          and a flood of golden light streamed out upon the
          steps.</p>
  <p>Two men-servants stood there. One remained in the hall,
          the other advanced to the chaise. He assisted Lady
          Isabel to alight, and then busied himself with the
          luggage. As she ascended to the hall she recognised
          old Peter: strange, indeed, did it seem, not to say,
          "How are you, Peter?" but to meet him as a stranger.
          For a moment she was at a loss for words: what
          should she say, or ask, coming to her own home? Her
          manner was embarrassed, her voice low.</p>
  <p>"Is Mrs. Carlyle within?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
  <p>At that moment, Joyce came forward to receive her. "It is
          Madame Vine, I believe?" she respectfully said.
          "Please to step this way, madame."</p>
  <p>But Lady Isabel lingered in the hall, ostensibly to see
          that her boxes came in right: Stephen was bringing
          them up then: in reality to gather a short respite,
          for Joyce might be about to usher her into the
          presence of Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Joyce, however, did nothing of the sort. She merely <pb n="285"/> conducted her to the grey parlour: a
          fire was burning in the grate, looking cheerful on
          the autumn night.</p>
  <p>"This is your sitting-room, madame. What will you please
          to take? I will order it brought in, while I show
          you your bed-chamber."</p>
  <p>"A cup of tea," answered Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Tea, and some cold meat with it," suggested Joyce. But
          Lady Isabel interrupted her.</p>
  <p>"Nothing but tea: and a little cold toast."</p>
  <p>Joyce rang the bell, ordered the refreshment to be made
          ready, and then preceded Lady Isabel up-stairs. On
          she followed, her heart palpitating: past the rooms
          that used to be hers, along the corridor, towards
          the second staircase. The doors of her old bed and
          dressing-rooms stood open, and she glanced in with a
          yearning look. No, never more, never more could they
          be hers: she had put them from her by her own free
          act and deed. Not less comfortable did they look
          now, than in former days: but they had passed into
          another's occupancy. The fire threw its blaze on the
          furniture: there were the little ornaments on the
          large dressing-table, as they used to be in
            <hi>her</hi> time, and the cut glass of the
          crystal essence bottles was glittering in the
          fire-light. On the sofa lay a shawl and a book, and
          on the bed a silk dress, as if thrown there after
          being taken off. No: these rooms were not for her
          now; and she followed Joyce up the other staircase.
          The bed-room to which she was shown was commodious
          and well furnished: it was the one Miss Carlyle had
          occupied when she, Isabel, had been taken, a bride,
          to East Lynne, though that lady had subsequently
          quitted it for one on the lower floor. Joyce put
          down the wax-light she carried, and looked
          round.</p>
  <pb n="286"/>
  <p>"Would you like a fire lighted here, madame, for
          to-night? Perhaps it will feel welcome, after
          travelling."</p>
  <p>"Oh no, thank you," was the answer.</p>
  <p>Stephen, with somebody to help him, was bringing up the
          luggage. Joyce directed him where to place it,
          telling him to uncord the boxes. That done, the man
          left the room, and Joyce turned to Lady Isabel, who
          had stood like a statue, never so much as attempting
          to remove her bonnet.</p>
  <p>"Can I do anything for you, madame?" she asked.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel declined. In these, her first moments of
          arrival, she was dreading detection: how was it
          possible that she should not?—and feared Joyce's
          keen eyes, more perhaps than she feared any others'.
          She was only wishing that the girl would go
          down.</p>
  <p>"Should you want any one, please to ring, and Hannah will
          come up," said Joyce, preparing to retire. "She is
          the maid who waits upon the grey parlour, and will
          do anything you like up here."</p>
  <p>Joyce had quitted the room, and Lady Isabel had got her
          bonnet off, when the door opened again. She hastily
          thrust it on—somewhat after the fashion of Richard
          Hare's rushing on his hat and his false whiskers. It
          was Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Do you think you shall find your way down alone,
          madame?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I can do that," she answered. Find her way! —in
          that house!</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel slowly took her things off. Where was the use
          of lingering?—she <hi>must</hi> meet their eyes
          sooner or later. Though, in truth, there was little,
          if any, fear of her detection, so effectually was
          she disguised, <pb n="287"/> by nature's altering
          hand, or by art's. It was with the utmost difficulty
          she kept tranquil: had the tears once burst forth,
          they would have gone on to hysterics, without the
          possibility of control. The coming home again to
          East Lynne! Oh, it was indeed a time of agitation;
          terrible, painful agitation: and none can wonder at
          it. Shall I tell you what she did? Yes, I will. She
          knelt down by the bed, and prayed for courage to go
          through the task she had undertaken, prayed for
          self-control: even she, the sinful, who had quitted
          that house under circumstances so notorious. But I
          am not sure that this mode of return to it was an
          expedition precisely calculated to call down a
          blessing.</p>
  <p>There was no excuse for lingering longer, and she
          descended, the wax-light in her hand. Everything was
          ready in the grey parlour; the tea-tray on the
          table, the small urn hissing away, the tea-caddy in
          proximity to it. A silver rack of dry toast, butter,
          and a hot muffin covered with a small silver cover.
          The things were to her sight as old faces; the rack,
          the small cover, the butter-dish, the tea-service;
          she remembered them all. Not the urn; a copper one:
          she had no recollection of that. It had possibly
          been bought for the use of the governess, when a
          governess came into use at East Lynne. If she had
          reflected on the matter, she might have known, by
          the signs observable in the short period she had
          been in the house, that governesses at East Lynne
          were regarded as gentlewomen; treated well and
          liberally. Yes; for East Lynne owned Mr. Carlyle for
          its master.</p>
  <p>She made the tea, and sat down with what appetite she
          might. Her brain, her thoughts, all in a chaos <pb n="288"/> together. She wondered whether Mr. and
          Mrs. Carlyle were at dinner: she wondered in what
          part of the house were the children. She heard bells
          ring now and then; she heard servants cross and
          recross the hall. Her meal over, she rang her
          own.</p>
  <p>A neat-looking, good-tempered maid answered it. Hannah.
          Who—as Joyce had informed her—waited upon the grey
          parlour, and was at her, the governess's especial
          command. She took away the things, and then Lady
          Isabel sat on alone. For how long she scarcely knew,
          when a sound caused her heart to beat as if it would
          burst its bounds, and she started from her chair
          like one who has received an electric shock.</p>
  <p>It was nothing to be startled at—for ordinary people; it
          was but the sound of children's voices. <hi>Her</hi>
          children! were they being brought in to her? She
          pressed her hand upon her heaving bosom.</p>
  <p>No: they were but traversing the hall, and the voices
          faded away up the wide staircase. Perhaps they had
          been in to dessert, as in the old times, and were
          now going up to bed. She looked at her new watch:
          half-past seven.</p>
  <p>Her <hi>new</hi> watch. The old one had been changed away
          for it. All her trinkets had been likewise parted
          with, sold, or changed away, lest they should be
          recognised at East Lynne. Nothing whatever had she
          kept, except her mother's miniature and the small
          golden cross, set with its seven emeralds. Have you
          forgotten that cross? Francis Levison accidentally
          broke it for her the first time they ever met. If
          she had looked upon the breaking of that cross,
          which her mother had enjoined her to set such store
          by, as an evil omen, at the time of the accident,
          how awfully had the subsequent <pb n="289"/> events
          seemed to bear her fancy out! These two articles,
          the miniature and the cross, she could not bring her
          mind to part with. She had sealed them up, and
          placed them in the remotest spot of her
          dressing-case, away from all chance of public view.
          Peter entered.</p>
  <p>"My mistress says, ma'am, she would be glad to see you,
          if you are not too tired. Will you please to walk
          into the drawing-room?"</p>
  <p>A mist swam before her eyes. Was she about to enter the
          presence of Mr. Carlyle?—had the moment really come?
          She moved to the door, which Peter held open. She
          turned her head from the man, for she could feel how
          ashy white were her face and lips.</p>
  <p>"Is Mrs. Carlyle alone?" she asked, in a subdued voice.
          The most indirect way she could put the question, as
          to whether Mr. Carlyle was there.</p>
  <p>"Quite alone, ma'am. My master is dining out today.
          Madame Vine, I think?" he added, waiting to announce
          her, as, the hall traversed, he laid his hand on the
          drawing-room door.</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine," she said, correcting him. For Peter had
          spoken the name, Vine, broadly, according to our
          English habitude; she set him right, and pronounced
          it à la mode française.</p>
  <p>"Madame Veen, ma'am," quoth Peter to his mistress, as he
          ushered in Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>The old familiar drawing-room; its large, handsome
          proportions, its well-arranged furniture, its bright
          chandelier! It all came back to her with a
          heart-sickness. No longer <hi>her</hi> drawing-room,
          that she should take pride in it: she had flung it
          away from her when she flung away the rest.</p>
  <p>Seated under the blaze of the chandelier was Barbara. <pb n="290"/> Not a day older did she look than when
          Lady Isabel had first seen her at the churchyard
          gates, when she had inquired of her husband who was
          that pretty girl. "Barbara Hare," he had answered.
          Ay. She was Barbara Hare, then, but now she was
          Barbara Carlyle: and she, she, who had been Isabel
          Carlyle, was Isabel Vane again! Oh woe! woe!</p>
  <p>Inexpressibly more beautiful looked Barbara than Lady
          Isabel had ever seen her—or else she fancied it. Her
          evening dress was of pale sky blue—no other colour
          suited Barbara so well, and there was no other she
          was so fond of—and on her fair neck was a gold
          chain, and on her arms were gold bracelets. Her
          pretty features were attractive as ever, her cheeks
          were flushed; her blue eyes sparkled, and her light
          hair was rich and abundant. A contrast, her hair, to
          that of the worn woman opposite to her.</p>
  <p>Barbara came forward, her hand stretched out with a
          kindly greeting. "I hope you are not very much tired
          after your journey?"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel murmured something: she did not know what:
          and pushed the chair set for her as much as possible
          into the shade.</p>
  <p>"You are not ill!—are you?" asked Barbara, noting the
          intensely pale face—as much as could be seen of it
          for the cap and the spectacles.</p>
  <p>"Not ill," was the low answer: "only a little
          fatigued."</p>
  <p>"Would you prefer that I should speak with you in the
          morning? You would like, possibly, to retire to bed
          at once."</p>
  <p>But this Lady Isabel declined. Better get the first
          interview over by candlelight than by daylight.</p>
  <pb n="291"/>
  <p>"You looked so very pale. I feared you might be ill."</p>
  <p>"I am generally pale; sometimes remarkably so: but my
          health is good."</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Latimer wrote us word that you would be quite sure
          to suit us," freely said Barbara. "I hope you will;
          and I hope you may find your residence here
          agreeable. Have you lived much in England?"</p>
  <p>"In the early portion of my life."</p>
  <p>"And you have lost your husband and children? Stay. I beg
          your pardon if I am making a mistake: I think Mrs.
          Latimer did mention children."</p>
  <p>"I have lost them," was the faint, quiet response.</p>
  <p>"Oh, but it must be terrible grief when children die!"
          exclaimed Barbara, clasping her hands in emotion. "I
          would not lose my baby for the world! I
            <hi>could</hi> not part with him."</p>
  <p>"Terrible grief, and hard to bear," outwardly assented
          Lady Isabel. But, in her heart she was thinking that
          death was not the worst kind of parting. There was
          another, far more dreadful. Mrs. Carlyle began to
          speak of the children, about to be placed under her
          charge.</p>
  <p>"You are no doubt aware that they are not mine! Mrs.
          Latimer would tell you. They are the children of Mr.
          Carlyle's first wife."</p>
  <p>"And Mr. Carlyle's," interrupted Lady Isabel. What in the
          world made her say that? She wondered, herself, the
          moment the words were out of her mouth. A scarlet
          streak flushed her cheeks, and she remembered that
          there must be no speaking upon impulse at East
          Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle's of course," said Barbara, believing <pb n="292"/> Madame Vine had but asked the question.
          "Their position—the girl's in particular—is a sad
          one, for their mother left them. Oh, it was a
          shocking business."</p>
  <p>"She is dead, I hear," said Lady Isabel, hoping to turn
          the immediate point of conversation. Mrs. Carlyle,
          however, continued, as though she had not heard
          her.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle married Lady Isabel Vane, the late Lord
          Mount Severn's daughter. She was attractive and
          beautiful, but I do not fancy she cared very much
          for her husband. However that may have been, she ran
          away from him."</p>
  <p>"It was very sad," observed Lady Isabel, feeling that she
          was expected to say something. Besides, she had her
            <hi>rôle</hi> to play.</p>
  <p>"Sad? It was wicked, it was infamous," returned Mrs.
          Carlyle, giving way to some excitement. "Of all men
          living, of all husbands, Mr. Carlyle least deserved
          such a requital. You will say so when you come to
          know him. And the affair altogether was a mystery:
          for it never was observed or suspected, by any one,
          that Lady Isabel entertained a liking for another.
          She eloped with Francis Levison—Sir Francis, he is
          now. He had been staying at East Lynne, but no one
          detected any undue intimacy between them, not even
          Mr. Carlyle. To him, as to others, her conduct must
          always remain a mystery."</p>
  <p>Madame Vine appeared to be occupied with her spectacles,
          setting them straight. Barbara continued.</p>
  <p>"Of course the disgrace is reflected on the children, and
          always will be; the shame of having a divorced
          mother—"</p>
  <pb n="293"/>
  <p>"Is she not dead?" interrupted Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"She is dead. Oh yes. But they will not be the less
          pointed at, the girl especially, as I say. They
          allude to their mother now and then, in
          conversation, Wilson tells me: but I would recommend
          you, Madame Vine, not to encourage them in that.
          They had better forget her."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle would naturally wish them to do so."</p>
  <p>"Most certainly. There is little doubt that Mr. Carlyle
          would blot out all recollection of her, were it
          possible. But unfortunately she was the children's
          mother, and, for that, there is no help. I trust you
          will be able to instil principles into the little
          girl which will keep her from a like fate."</p>
  <p>"I will try," answered Lady Isabel, with more fervour
          than she had yet spoken. "Are the children much with
          you, may I inquire?"</p>
  <p>"No. I never was fond of being troubled with children.
          When my own grow up into childhood, I shall deem the
          nursery and the schoolroom the best places for them.
          I hold an opinion, Madame Vine, that too many
          mothers pursue a mistaken system in the management
          of their family. There are some, we know, who, lost
          in the pleasures of the world, in frivolity, wholly
          neglect them: of those I do not speak; nothing can
          be more thoughtless, more reprehensible; but there
          are others who err on the opposite side. They are
          never happy but when with their children: they must
          be in the nursery; or, the children in the
          drawing-room. They wash them, dress them, feed them;
          rendering themselves slaves, and the nurse's office
          a sinecure. The children are noisy, troublesome,
          cross; all children will be so; and the mother's
          temper gets <pb n="294"/> soured, and she gives
          slaps where, when they were babies, she gave kisses.
          She has no leisure, no spirits for any higher
          training: and as they grow old she loses her
          authority. One who is wearied, tired out with her
          children, cross when they play or make a little
          extra noise, which jars on her unstrung nerves, who
          says, 'You shan't do this; you shall be still,' and
          that perpetually, is sure to be rebelled against at
          last: it cannot be otherwise. Have you never
          observed this?"</p>
  <p>"I have."</p>
  <p>"The discipline of that house soon becomes broken. The
          children run wild; the husband is sick of it, and
          seeks peace and solace elsewhere. I could mention
          instances in this neighbourhood," continued Mrs.
          Carlyle, "where things are managed precisely as I
          have described, even in our own class of life. I
          consider it a most mistaken and pernicious
          system."</p>
  <p>"It undoubtedly is," answered Lady Isabel, feeling a sort
          of thankfulness, poor thing, that the system had not
          been hers—when she had a home and children.</p>
  <p>"Now, what I trust I shall never give up to another, will
          be the <hi>training</hi> of my children," pursued
          Barbara. "Let the offices, properly pertaining to a
          nurse, be performed by the nurse—of course taking
          care that she is thoroughly to be depended on. Let
          her have the <hi>trouble</hi> of the children, their
          noise, their romping; in short, let the nursery be
          her place and the children's place. But I hope I
          shall never fail to gather my children round me
          daily, at stated and convenient periods, for higher
          purposes: to instil into them Christian and moral
          duties; to strive to teach them how best to fulfil
          the obligations of life. <hi>This</hi> is a mother's
            <pb n="295"/> task—as I understand the question;
          let her do this work well, and the nurse can attend
          to the rest. A child should never hear aught from
          its mother's lips but persuasive gentleness; and
          this becomes impossible, if she is very much with
          her children."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel silently assented. Mrs. Carlyle's views were
          correct.</p>
  <p>"When I first came to East Lynne, I found Miss Manning,
          the governess, was doing everything necessary for
          Mr. Carlyle's children in the way of the training
          that I speak of," resumed Barbara. "She had them
          with her for a short period every morning, even the
          little one: I saw that it was all right, therefore
          did not interfere. Since she left—it is nearly a
          month, now —I have taken them myself. We were sorry
          to part with Miss Manning; she suited very well. But
          she has been long engaged to an officer in the navy,
          and now they are to be married. You will have the
          entire charge of the little girl: she will be your
          companion out of school hours: did you understand
          that?"</p>
  <p>"I am quite ready and willing to undertake it," said Lady
          Isabel, her heart fluttering. "Are the children
          well? Do they enjoy good health?"</p>
  <p>"Quite so. They had the measles in the spring, and the
          illness left a cough upon William, the eldest boy.
          Mr. Wainwright says he will outgrow it."</p>
  <p>"He has it still, then?"</p>
  <p>"At night and morning. They went last week to spend the
          day with Miss Carlyle, and were a little late in
          returning home. It was foggy, and the boy coughed
          dreadfully after he came in. Mr. Carlyle was so
          concerned, that he left the dinner-table and went up
          to the nursery: he gave Joyce strict orders that the
          child <pb n="296"/> should never again be out in the
          evening air, so long as the cough was upon him. We
          had never heard him cough like that."</p>
  <p>"Do you fear consumption?" asked Lady Isabel in a low
          tone.</p>
  <p>"I do not fear that, or any other incurable disease for
          them," answered Barbara. "I think, with Mr.
          Wainwright, that time will remove the cough. The
          children come of a healthly stock on their father's
          side: and I have no reason to think they do not, on
          their mother's. She died young, you will say. Ay,
          but she did not die of disease: her death was the
          result of accident. How many children had you?"
          pursued Mrs. Carlyle, somewhat abruptly.</p>
  <p>At least, the question fell with abruptness upon the ear
          of Lady Isabel, for she was not prepared for it.
          What should she answer? In her perplexity she
          stammered forth the actual truth.</p>
  <p>"Three. And—and a baby. That died. Died an infant, I
          mean."</p>
  <p>"To lose four dear children!" uttered Barbara, with
          sympathising pity. "What did they die of?"</p>
  <p>A hesitating pause. "Some of one thing, some of another,"
          was the answer, given in almost an inaudible
          tone.</p>
  <p>"Did they die before your husband? Otherwise the grief
          must have been worse to bear."</p>
  <p>"The—baby—died after him," stammered Lady Isabel, as she
          wiped the drops from her pale forehead.</p>
  <p>Barbara detected her emotion, and felt sorry to have made
          the inquiries: she judged it was caused by the
          recollection of her children.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Latimer wrote us word you were of gentle <pb n="297"/> birth and breeding," she resumed,
          presently. "I am sure you will excuse my asking
          these particular questions," Barbara added, in a
          tone of apology, "but this is our first interview:
          our preliminary interview, it may in a measure be
          called, for we could not say much by letter."</p>
  <p>"I was born and reared a gentlewoman," answered Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Yes, I am sure of it; there is no mistaking the tone of
          a gentlewoman," said Barbara. "How sad it is when
          pecuniary reverses fall upon us! I dare say you
          never thought to go out as governess."</p>
  <p>A half smile positively crossed her lips. She, think to
          go out as a governess!—the Earl of Mount Severn's
          only child! "Oh no, never," she said, in reply.</p>
  <p>"Your husband, I fear, could not leave you well off. Mrs.
          Latimer said something to that effect."</p>
  <p>"When I lost him, I lost all," was the answer. And Mrs.
          Carlyle was struck with the wailing pain betrayed in
          the tone. At that moment a maid entered.</p>
  <p>"Nurse says the baby is undressed, and quite ready for
          you, ma'am," she said, addressing her mistress.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carlyle rose: but hesitated as she was moving
          away.</p>
  <p>"I will have the baby here to-night," she said to the
          girl. "Tell nurse to put a shawl round him and bring
          him down. It is the hour for my baby's supper," she
          smiled, turning to Lady Isabel. "I may as well have
          him here for once, as Mr. Carlyle is out. Sometimes
          I am out myself, and then he has to be fed."</p>
  <p>"You do not stay in-doors for the baby, then?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly not. If I and Mr. Carlyle have to be out in
          the evening, baby gives way. I should never <pb n="298"/> give up my husband for my baby; never,
          dearly as I love him."</p>
  <p>The nurse came in. Wilson. She unfolded a shawl, and
          placed the baby on Mrs. Carlyle's lap. A proud,
          fine, fair young baby, who reared his head and
          opened wide his great blue eyes, and beat his arms
          at the lights of the chandelier, as no baby of
          nearly six months old ever did yet. So thought
          Barbara. He was in his clean white night-gown and
          night-cap, with their pretty crimped frills and
          border; altogether a pleasant sight to look upon.
            <hi>She</hi> had once sat in that very chair, with
          a baby as fair upon her knee: but, all that was past
          and gone. She leaned her hot head upon her hand, and
          a rebellious sigh of envy went forth from her aching
          heart.</p>
  <p>Wilson, the curious, was devouring her with her eyes;
          Wilson was thinking she never saw such a mortal
          fright as the new governess. Them blue spectacles
          capped everything, she decided: and what on earth
          made her tie up her throat, in that fashion, for? As
          well wear a man's collar and stock, at once! If her
          teaching was no better than her looks, Miss Lucy
          might as well go to the parish charity school!</p>
  <p>"Shall I wait, ma'am?" demurely asked Wilson, her
          investigations being concluded.</p>
  <p>"No," said Mrs. Carlyle. "I will ring."</p>
  <p>Baby was exceedingly busy, taking his supper. And of
          course, according to all baby precedent, he ought to
          have gone off into a sound sleep over it. But the
          supper concluded, and the gentleman seemed to have
          no more sleep in his eyes than he had before he
          began. He sat up, crowed at the lights, stretched
          out his hands for them, and set his mother at
          defiance, absolutely refusing to be hushed up.</p>
  <pb n="299"/>
  <p>"Do you wish to keep awake all night, you rebel?" cried
          Barbara, fondly looking on him.</p>
  <p>A loud crow by way of answer. Perhaps it was intended to
          intimate that he did. She clasped him to her with a
          sudden gesture of rapture, a sound of love, and
          devoured his pretty face with kisses. Then she took
          him in her arms, putting him to sit upright, and
          approached Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"Did you ever see a more lovely child?"</p>
  <p>"A fine baby indeed," she constrained herself to answer:
          and she could have fancied it her own little
          Archibald over again when he was a baby. "But he is
          not much like you."</p>
  <p>"He is the very image of my darling husband. When you see
          Mr. Carlyle—" Barbara stopped, and bent her ear, as
          if listening.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle is probably a handsome man?" said poor Lady
          Isabel, believing that the pause was made to give
          her opportunity of putting in an observation.</p>
  <p>"He is handsome; but that is the least good about him. He
          is the most noble man! revered, respected by every
          one; I may say, loved. The only one who could not
          appreciate him was his wife. How ever she could
          leave him—how she could even look at another, after
          calling Mr. Carlyle husband, will always be a marvel
          to those who know him."</p>
  <p>A bitter groan—and it nearly escaped her lips.</p>
  <p>"That certainly is the pony carriage," cried Barbara,
          bending her ear again. "If so, how very early Mr.
          Carlyle is home! Yes, I am sure it is the sound of
          the wheels."</p>
  <p>How Lady Isabel sat, she scarcely knew; how she concealed
          her trepidation, she never would know. A <pb n="300"/> pause; an entrance to the hall; Barbara, baby in
          arms, advanced to the drawing-room door, and a tall
          form entered. Once more Lady Isabel was in the
          presence of her sometime husband.</p>
  <p>He did not perceive that any one was present, and he bent
          his head and fondly kissed his wife. Isabel's
          jealous eyes were turned upon them. She saw
          Barbara's passionate, lingering kiss in return, she
          heard her fervent, whispered greeting. "My darling!"
          and she watched him turn to press the same fond
          kisses on the rosy, open lips of his child. Isabel
          flung her hands over her face. Had she bargained for
          this? It was part of the cross she had undertaken to
          carry, and she <hi>must</hi> bear it.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle came forward and saw her. He looked somewhat
          surprised. "Madame Vine," said Barbara; and he held
          out his hand and welcomed her in the same cordial,
          pleasant manner that his wife had done. She put her
          shaking hand in his: there was no help for it:
          little thought Mr. Carlyle that that hand had been
          tenderly clasped in his a thousand times; that it
          was the one pledged to him at the altar at Castle
          Marling.</p>
  <p>She sat down on her chair again, unable to stand, feeling
          as though every drop of blood within her had left
          her body. It had certainly left her face. Mr.
          Carlyle made a few civil inquiries as to her
          journey, but she did not dare to raise her eyes to
          him, as she breathed forth the answers.</p>
  <p>"You are at home soon, Archibald," Barbara exclaimed. "I
          did not expect you so early. I did not think you
          could get away. I know what the justices' <pb n="301"/> annual dinner at the Buck's Head is;
          they always make it late."</p>
  <p>"As they will to-night," laughed Mr. Carlyle. "I watched
          my opportunity, and got away when the pipes were
          brought in: I had determined to do so, if possible.
          Dill—who means to stick it out with the best of them
          —has his tale ready when they miss me. 'Suddenly
          called away: important business; could not be
          helped.'"</p>
  <p>Barbara laughed also. "Was papa there?"</p>
  <p>"Of course. He took the table's head. What would the
          dinner be without the chairman of the bench,
          Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing at all, in papa's opinion," merrily said
          Barbara. "Did you ask him how mamma was?"</p>
  <p>"I asked him," said Mr. Carlyle. And there he
          stopped.</p>
  <p>"Well?" cried Barbara. "What did he say?"</p>
  <p>"'Full of nervous fidgets,' was the answer he made me,"
          returned Mr. Carlyle, with an arch look at his wife.
          "It was all I could get out of him."</p>
  <p>"That is just like papa. Archibald, do you know what I
          have been thinking to-day?"</p>
  <p>"A great many foolish things, I dare say," he answered:
          but his tone was a fond one: all too palpably so for
          one ear.</p>
  <p>"No, but listen. You know papa is going to London with
          Squire Pinner, to see those new agricultural
          implements—or whatever it is. They are sure to be
          away three days. Don't you think so?"</p>
  <p>"And three to the back of it," said Mr. Carlyle, with a
          wicked smile upon his lips. "When old gentlemen get
          plunged into the attractions of London, there's no
            <pb n="302"/> answering for their getting out of
          them in a hurry, country justices especially. Well,
          Barbara?"</p>
  <p>"I was thinking if we could but persuade mamma to come to
          us for the time he is away! It would be a delightful
          little change for her; a break in her monotonous
          life."</p>
  <p>"I wish you could," warmly spoke Mr. Carlyle. "Her life,
          since you left, is a monotonous one; though, in her
          gentle patience, she will not say so. It is a happy
          thought, Barbara, and I only hope it may be carried
          out. Mrs. Carlyle's mother is an invalid, and
          lonely, for she has no child at home with her now,"
          he added, in a spirit of politeness, addressing
          himself to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>She simply bowed her head: she did not trust herself to
          speak. Mr. Carlyle scanned her face attentively, as
          she sat, her head bent downwards. She did not appear
          inclined to be sociable, and he turned to the baby,
          who was wider awake than ever.</p>
  <p>"Young sir, I should like to know what brings you up, and
          here, at this hour?"</p>
  <p>"You may well ask," said Barbara. "I had him brought
          down, as you were not here, thinking he would be
          asleep directly. And only look at him!—no more sleep
          in his eyes than in mine."</p>
  <p>She would have hushed him to her as she spoke, but the
          young gentleman stoutly repudiated it. He set up a
          half cry, and struggled his arms and head free
          again, crowing the next moment most impudently. Mr.
          Carlyle took him.</p>
  <p>"It is of no use, Barbara, he is beyond your coaxing this
          evening." And he tossed the child in his strong
          arms, held him up to the chandelier, made him bob at
            <pb n="303"/> the baby in the pier-glass, until
          the rebel was in an ecstasy of delight. Finally he
          smothered his face with kisses, as Barbara had done.
          Barbara rang the bell.</p>
  <p>Oh! can you imagine what it was for Lady Isabel? So had
          he tossed, so had he kissed her children, she
          standing by, the fond, proud, happy mother, as
          Barbara was standing now. Mr. Carlyle came up to
          her.</p>
  <p>"Are you fond of these little troubles, Madame Vine? This
          one is a fine fellow, they say."</p>
  <p>"Very fine. What is his name?" she replied, by way of
          saying something.</p>
  <p>"Arthur."</p>
  <p>"Arthur Archibald," put in Barbara to Madame Vine. "I was
          vexed that his name could not be entirely Archibald,
          but that was already monopolised. Is that you,
          Wilson? I don't know what you'll do with him, but he
          looks as if he would not be asleep by twelve
          o'clock."</p>
  <p>Wilson satisfied her curiosity by taking another
          prolonged stare at Madame Vine, received the baby
          from Mr. Carlyle, and departed with him.</p>
  <p>Madame Vine rose. Would they excuse her? she asked, in a
          low tone: she was tired, and would be glad to retire
          to rest.</p>
  <p>Of course. And would she ring for anything she might wish
          in the way of refreshment. Barbara shook hands with
          her, in her friendly way; and Mr. Carlyle crossed
          the room to open the door for her, and bowed her out
          with a courtly smile.</p>
  <p>She went up to her chamber at once. To rest? Well, what
          think you? She strove to say to her lacerated and
          remorseful heart, that the cross—far heavier though
          it was proving, than anything she had imagined <pb n="304"/> or pictured—was only what she had
          brought upon herself, and <hi>must</hi> bear. Very
          true: but none of us would like such a cross to be
          upon our shoulders.</p>
  <p>"Is she not droll looking?" cried Barbara, when she was
          alone with Mr. Carlyle. "I can't think why she wears
          those blue spectacles: it cannot be for her sight,
          and they are very disfiguring."</p>
  <p>"She puts me in mind of—of—" began Mr. Carlyle, in a
          dreamy tone.</p>
  <p>"Of whom?"</p>
  <p>"Her face, I mean," he said, still dreaming.</p>
  <p>"So little can be seen of it," returned Mrs. Carlyle. "Of
          whom does she put you in mind?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know. Nobody in particular," returned he,
          rousing himself. "Let us have tea in, Barbara."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER III. THE YEARNING OF A BREAKING HEART.</head>
  <p><hi>At</hi> her bedroom door, the next morning, stood
          Lady Isabel, listening whether the coast was clear,
          ere she descended to the grey parlour, for she had a
          shrinking dread of encountering Mr. Carlyle. When he
          was glancing narrowly at her face the previous
          evening, she had felt the gaze, and it impressed
          upon her a dread of his recognition. Not only that:
          he was the husband of another: therefore it was not
          expedient that she should see too much of him, for
          he was far dearer to her heart than he had ever
          been.</p>
  <p>Almost at the same moment, there burst out of a remote
          room, the nursery, an upright, fair, noble boy of
          some five years old, who began careering along the
          corridor, astride upon a hearth-broom. She did not
          need to be told that it was her boy, Archibald; his
          likeness to Mr. Carlyle would have proclaimed it,
          even if her heart had not. In an impulse of
          unrestrainable tenderness, she seized the child as
          he was galloping past her, and carried him into her
          room, broom and all.</p>
  <p>"You must let me make acquaintance with you," said she to
          him, by way of excuse. "I love little boys."</p>
  <p>Love! Down she sat upon a low chair, the child <pb n="306"/> held upon her lap, kissing him
          passionately, and the tears raining from her eyes.
          She could not have helped the tears, had it been to
          save her life; she could as little have helped the
          kisses. Lifting her eyes, there stood Wilson, who
          had entered without ceremony. A sick feeling came
          over Lady Isabel: she felt as if she had betrayed
          herself. All that could be done now, was to make the
          best of it; to offer some lame excuse. What
          possessed her, thus to forget herself?</p>
  <p>"He put me in remembrance of my own children," she said
          to Wilson, gulping down her emotion, and hiding her
          tears in the best manner she could; whilst the
          astonished Archibald, now released, stood with his
          finger in his mouth and stared at her spectacles,
          his great blue eyes opened to their utmost width.
          "When we have lost children of our own, we are apt
          to love fondly all we come near."</p>
  <p>Wilson, who stared only in a less degree than Archie, for
          she deemed the new governess had gone suddenly mad,
          gave some voluble assent, and turned her attention
          upon Archie.</p>
  <p>"You naughty young monkey! how dared you rush out in that
          way with Sarah's hearth-broom? I'll tell you what it
          is, sir; you are getting too owdacious and
          rumbustical for the nursery; I shall speak to your
          mamma about it."</p>
  <p>She seized hold of the child and shook him. Lady Isabel
          started forward, her hands up, her voice one of
          painful entreaty.</p>
  <p>"Oh, don't, don't beat him! I cannot see him beaten."</p>
  <p>"Beaten!" echoed Wilson; "if he got a good beating it
          would be all the better for him; but it's what <pb n="307"/> he never does get. A little shake, or a
          tap, is all I must give; and it's not half enough.
          You wouldn't believe the sturdy impudence of that
          boy, madame; he runs riot, he does. The other two
          never gave a quarter of the trouble. Come along, you
          figure! I'll have a bolt put at the top of the
          nursery door!—And if I did, he'd be for climbing up
          the door-post to get at it."</p>
  <p>The last sentence Wilson delivered to the governess, as
          she jerked Archie out of the room, along the passage
          and into the nursery. Lady Isabel sat down with a
          wrung heart, a chafed spirit. Her own child! and she
          might not say to the servant, You shall not beat
          him!</p>
  <p>She descended to the grey parlour. The two elder
          children, and breakfast, were waiting: Joyce quitted
          the room when she entered it.</p>
  <p>A graceful girl of eight years old, a fragile boy a year
          younger, both bearing her own once lovely features,
          her once bright and delicate complexion, her large,
          soft, brown eyes. How utterly her heart yearned to
          them! but there must be no scene like there had just
          been above. Nevertheless, she stooped and kissed
          them both; one kiss each of impassioned fervour.
          Lucy was naturally silent, William somewhat
          talkative.</p>
  <p>"You are our new governess," said he.</p>
  <p>"Yes. We must be good friends."</p>
  <p>"Why not?" said the boy. "We were good friends with Miss
          Manning. I am to go into Latin soon, as soon as my
          cough's gone. Do you know Latin?"</p>
  <p>"No. Not to teach it," she said, studiously avoiding all
          endearing epithets.</p>
  <p>"Papa said you would be almost sure not to know <pb n="308"/> Latin, for that ladies rarely did. He
          said he should send up Mr. Kane to teach me."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Kane?" repeated Lady Isabel, the name striking upon
          her memory. "Mr. Kane, the music-master?"</p>
  <p>"How did you know he was a music-master?" cried shrewd
          William. And Lady Isabel felt the red blood flush to
          her face at the unlucky admission she had made. It
          flushed deeper at her own falsehood, as she muttered
          some evasive words about hearing of him from Mrs.
          Latimer.</p>
  <p>"Yes, he is a music-master; but he does not get much
          money by it, and he teaches the classics as well. He
          has come up to teach us music since Miss Manning
          left: mamma said that we ought not to lose our
          lessons."</p>
  <p>Mamma! How the word, applied to Barbara, grated on her
          ear. "Whom does he teach?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Us two," replied William, pointing to his sister and
          himself.</p>
  <p>"Do you always take bread-and-milk for breakfast?" she
          inquired, perceiving that to be what they were
          eating.</p>
  <p>"We get tired of it sometimes, and then we have
          milk-and-water and bread-and-butter, or honey: and
          then we take to bread-and-milk again. It's Aunt
          Cornelia who thinks we should eat bread-and-milk for
          breakfast: she says papa never had anything else
          when he was a boy."</p>
  <p>Lucy looked up. "Papa would give me an egg when I
          breakfasted with him," cried she, "and Aunt Cornelia
          said it was not good for me, but papa gave it <pb n="309"/> me all the same. I always had breakfast
          with him then."</p>
  <p>"And why do you not now?" asked Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I don't know. I have not since mamma came."</p>
  <p>The word "stepmother" rose up rebelliously in the heart
          of Lady Isabel. Was Mrs. Carlyle putting away the
          children from their father?</p>
  <p>Breakfast over, she gathered them to her, asking them
          various questions; about their studies, their hours
          of recreation, the daily routine of their lives.</p>
  <p>"This is not the school-room, you know," cried William,
          when she made some inquiry as to their books.</p>
  <p>"No?"</p>
  <p>"The school-room is up-stairs. This is for our meals, and
          for you in an evening."</p>
  <p>The voice of Mr. Carlyle was heard at this juncture in
          the hall, and Lucy was springing towards the sound.
          Lady Isabel, fearful lest he might enter, if the
          child showed herself, stopped her with a hurried
          hand.</p>
  <p>"Stay here, Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Her name's Lucy," said William, looking quickly up. "Why
          do you call her Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"I thought—thought I had heard her called Isabel,"
          stammered the unfortunate lady, feeling quite
          confused with the errors she was committing.</p>
  <p>"My name is Isabel Lucy," said the child, "but I don't
          know who could have told you, for I am never called
          Isabel. I have not been, since—since—Shall I tell
          you? Since mamma went away," she concluded, dropping
          her voice. "Mamma that was, you know."</p>
  <p>"Did she go?" cried Lady Isabel, full of emotion and
          possessing a very faint idea of what she was
          saying.</p>
  <p>"She was kidnapped," whispered Lucy.</p>
  <pb n="310"/>
  <p>"Kidnapped!" was the surprised answer.</p>
  <p>"Yes; or she would not have gone. There was a wicked man
          on a visit to papa, and he stole her. Wilson said
          she knew he was a kidnapper, before he took mamma.
          Papa said I was never to be called Isabel again, but
          Lucy. Isabel was mamma's name."</p>
  <p>"How do you know your papa said it?" dreamily returned
          Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I heard him. He said it to Joyce, and Joyce told the
          servants. I put only Lucy to my copies. I did put
          Isabel Lucy, but papa saw it one day, and he drew
          his pencil through Isabel, and told me to show it to
          Miss Manning. After that, Miss Manning let me put
          nothing but Lucy. I asked her why, and she told me
          papa preferred the name, and that I was not to ask
          questions."</p>
  <p>She could not well stop the child, but every word was
          rending her heart.</p>
  <p>"Lady Isabel was our very very own mamma," pursued Lucy.
          "This mamma is not."</p>
  <p>"Do you love this one as you did the other?" breathed
          Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Oh, I loved mamma! I loved mamma!" uttered Lucy,
          clasping her hands. "But it's all over. Wilson said
          we must not love her any longer, and Aunt Cornelia
          said it. Wilson said, if she had loved us, she would
          not have gone away from us."</p>
  <p>"Wilson said so?" resentfully spoke Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"She said she need not have let that man kidnap her. I am
          afraid he beat her: for she died. I lie in my bed at
          night, and wonder whether he did beat her, and what
          made her die. It was after she died that our new
          mamma came home. Papa said she was come to <pb n="311"/> be our mamma in place of Lady Isabel,
          and we were to love her dearly."</p>
  <p>" <hi>Do</hi> you love her?" almost passionately asked
          Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>Lucy shook her head. "Not as I loved mamma."</p>
  <p>Joyce entered to show the way to the school-room, and
          they followed her up-stairs. As Lady Isabel stood at
          the window, she saw Mr. Carlyle depart on foot, on
          his way to the office. Barbara was with him, hanging
          fondly on his arm, about to accompany him to the
          park gates. So had <hi>she</hi> fondly hung, so had
            <hi>she</hi> accompanied him, in the days gone for
          ever.</p>
  <p>Barbara came into the school-room in the course of the
          morning, and entered upon the subject of their
          studies, the differently allotted hours, some to
          play, some to work. She spoke in a courteous but
          most decided tone, showing that she was the
          unmistakable mistress of the house and children, and
          meant to be. Never had Lady Isabel felt her position
          more keenly; never had it so galled and fretted her
          spirit: but she bowed in meek obedience. A hundred
          times that day did she yearn to hold the children to
          her heart, and a hundred times she had to repress
          the longing.</p>
  <p>Before tea, when the beams of the sun were slanting
          across the western horizon, she went out with the
          two children. They took the field path, leading
          parallel with the high-road, the hedge only dividing
          them; the path that Captain Levison used to take
          when he went to pry into the movements of Mr.
          Carlyle. To the excessive dismay of Lady Isabel,
          whom should they come upon, but Mr. and Mrs.
          Carlyle: they were walking home from West Lynne
          together, and had chosen the field way.</p>
  <pb n="312"/>
  <p>A confused greeting: it was confused to the senses of
          Lady Isabel: and then they were all returning
          together. Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle in advance: she and
          the children behind.</p>
  <p>She slackened her pace. She strove to put all possible
          distance between herself and them. It did not avail
          her. Coming to a stile, Mr. Carlyle helped his wife
          over it, and then waited. The children were soon on
          the other side: little need of help for them: but he
          remained, in his courtesy, to assist the
          governess.</p>
  <p>"I thank you," she panted, as she came up. "I do not
          require help."</p>
  <p>Words that fell idly on his ear. He stood waiting for
          her, and she had no resource but to mount the stile:
          an awkward stile: she remembered it of old. Not more
          awkward, however, than she herself was at that
          moment. Before her was Mr. Carlyle's outstretched
          hand, and she could do no less than put the tips of
          her fingers into it: but, in her trepidation she got
          her feet entangled in her petticoats; and, in
          attempting to jump, would have fallen, had not Mr.
          Carlyle caught her in his arms.</p>
  <p>"You are not hurt, I trust!" he exclaimed, in his kindly
          manner.</p>
  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir; my foot caught. Oh no, I am not
          hurt. Thank you."</p>
  <p>He walked forward and took his wife upon his arm, who had
          turned to wait for him. Lady Isabel lingered behind,
          striving to still her beating heart.</p>
  <p>They were at tea in the grey parlour, she and the two
          children, when William was seized with a fit of
          coughing. It was long and violent. Lady Isabel left
          her seat: she had drawn him to her, and was hanging
          over him with unguarded tenderness, when, happening
          to lift <pb n="313"/> her eyes, they fell upon Mr.
          Carlyle. He had been descending the stairs, on his
          way from his dressing-room, heard the cough, and
          came in. Had Lady Isabel been killing the boy, she
          could not have dropped him more suddenly.</p>
  <p>"You possess a natural love for children, I perceive," he
          said, looking at her with his sweet smile.</p>
  <p>She did not know what she answered: some confused,
          murmured words. If Mr. Carlyle made sense of them,
          he was clever. Into the darkest corner of the room
          retreated she.</p>
  <p>"What is the matter?" interrupted Mrs. Carlyle, looking
          in. She also had been descending, and was in her
          dinner dress. Mr. Carlyle had the boy on his own
          knee then.</p>
  <p>"William's cough is troublesome. I don't like it,
          Barbara. I shall have Wainwright up again."</p>
  <p>"It's nothing," said Barbara. "He was at his tea: perhaps
          a crumb went the wrong way. Dinner is waiting,
          Archibald."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle put the boy down, but stood for a minute
          looking at him. The cough over, he was pale and
          exhausted, all his brilliant colour gone: it was too
          brilliant, as Afy had said. Mrs. Carlyle entwined
          her arm within her husband's, but turned her head to
          speak as they were walking away.</p>
  <p>"You will come into the drawing-room by-and-by with Miss
          Lucy, Madame Vine. We wish to hear you play."</p>
  <p><hi>Miss</hi> Lucy! And it was spoken in the light of a
          command. Well? Barbara was Mrs. Carlyle, and she
          was—what she was. Once more she drew to her her
          first-born son, and laid her aching forehead upon
          him.</p>
  <pb n="314"/>
  <p>"Do you cough at night, iny darling child?"</p>
  <p>"Not much," he answered. "Joyce puts me some jam by the
          bed-side, and if I have a fit of coughing, I eat
          that. It's back currant."</p>
  <p>"He means jelly," interposed Lucy, her mouth full of
          bread-and-butter. "It is black currant jelly."</p>
  <p>"Yes, jelly," said William. "It's all the same."</p>
  <p>"Does any one sleep in your room?" she inquired of
          him.</p>
  <p>"No. I have a room to myself."</p>
  <p>She fell into deep thought, wondering whether they would
          let a little bed be put in her room for him,
          wondering whether she might dare to ask it. Who
          could watch over him and attend to him as she would?
          In this one day's intercourse with William, she had
          become aware that he was possessed of that
          precocious intellect which too frequently attends
          weakness of body. He had the sense of a boy of
          fourteen, instead of one of seven: his conversation
          betrayed it. "Knowing," "understands more than's
          good for a child," say old wives, as they look and
          listen, coupling their remark with another, "he'll
          never live."</p>
  <p>"Should you like to sleep in my room?" asked Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I don't know. Why should I sleep in your room?"</p>
  <p>"I could attend to you; could give you jelly, or anything
          else you might require, if you were to cough in the
          night. I would love you, I would be tender with you
          as your own mamma could have been."</p>
  <p>"Mamma did not love us," cried he. "Had she loved us she
          would not have left us."</p>
  <p>"She did love us," exclaimed Lucy, somewhat <pb n="315"/>
          fiercely. "Joyce says she did, and I remember it. It
          wasn't her fault that she was kidnapped."</p>
  <p>"You be quiet, Lucy: girls know nothing about things.
          Mamma—"</p>
  <p>"Child, child," interposed Lady Isabel, the scalding
          tears filling her eyes, "your mamma did love you:
          loved you dearly: loved you, as she could never love
          anything again."</p>
  <p>"You can't tell that, Madame Vine," persisted William,
          disposed to be resolute. "You were not here; you did
          not know mamma."</p>
  <p>"I am sure she must have loved you," was all Madame Vine
          dared to answer. "I have been here but a day, and I
          have learnt to love you. I love you already, very
          very much."</p>
  <p>She pressed her lips to his hot cheek as she spoke, and
          the rebellious tears would not be restrained, but
          fell on it also.</p>
  <p>"Why do you cry?" asked William.</p>
  <p>"I once," she answered, in a low tone, "lost a dear
          little boy like you, and I am so glad to have you to
          replace him: I have had nothing to love since."</p>
  <p>"What was his name?" cried curious William.</p>
  <p>"William." But the word was scarcely out of her lips
          before she thought how foolish she was to say
          it.</p>
  <p>"William Vine," cogitated the boy. "Did he speak French
          or English? His papa was French, was he not?"</p>
  <p>"He spoke English. But you have not finished your tea,"
          she added, finding the questions were becoming
          close.</p>
  <p>It was Barbara's custom, when they were at home, to leave
          Mr. Carlyle at the dessert-table and to go up <pb n="316"/> for a few minutes to her baby, before
          entering the drawing-room. As she was descending on
          this evening, she saw Lucy, who was peeping out of
          the grey parlour.</p>
  <p>"May we come in now, mamma?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. Ask Madame Vine to bring in some music."</p>
  <p>Madame Vine, delaying as long as she dared, arrived at
          the drawing-room door at an inopportune moment, for
          Mr. Carlyle was just coming from the dining-room.
          She paused when she saw him: her first impulse was
          to retreat; but he looked round and appeared to wait
          for her. Lucy had already gone in.</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine," he began, his hand upon the door-handle,
          and his tone suppressed, "have you had much
          experience in the ailments of children?"</p>
  <p>She was about to answer "No." For her own children, so
          long as she had been with them, were remarkably
          healthy. But she remembered that she was supposed to
          have lost four by death, and must speak
          accordingly.</p>
  <p>"Not a very great deal, sir. Somewhat, of course."</p>
  <p>"Does it strike you that this is an ugly cough of
          William's?"</p>
  <p>"I think that he wants care; that he should be
          continually watched, especially at night. I was
          wishing that he might be allowed to sleep in my
          room," she added, some strong impulse prompting her
          to prefer this request to Mr. Carlyle, trembling
          inwardly and outwardly, as she did so. "His bed
          could be readily moved in, and I would attend to
          him, sir, as—as—I would attend more cautiously than
          any servant could be likely to do."</p>
  <p>"By no means," warmly responded Mr. Carlyle. "We would
          not think of giving you the trouble. He <pb n="317"/> is not ill, to require night nursing: and, if he
          were, our servants are to be depended on."</p>
  <p>"I am so fond of children," she ventured to plead. "I
          have already taken a great liking for his one, and
          would wish to make his health my care by night and
          by day. It would be a pleasure to me."</p>
  <p>"You are truly kind. But I am sure Mrs. Carlyle would not
          hear of it: it would be taxing you
          unreasonably."</p>
  <p>His tone was one of decision, and he opened the door for
          her to pass in.</p>
  <p>What she most dreaded, of all, was her singing. The lisp
          was not perceptible when she sung, and she feared
          her voice, her tones, might be recognised. She was
          determined not to attempt any song that she had ever
          sung in that house, and to give her voice but half
          its full compass. She remembered how ardently her
          husband had admired her singing in the days gone by.
          Barbara sang to him now.</p>
  <p>For that evening, there was a respite. Not many minutes
          had elapsed after her entrance, when one of the
          servants appeared, showing in Justice Hare, his
          march pompous as ever, his wig in elaborate order.
          No singing when he was present, for the sweetest
          melody was lost upon him. Barbara and Mr. Carlyle
          both rose to greet him.</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa; what a wonder to see you in an evening! I am
          very glad. Come to the easy-chair. Madame Vine,"
          added Barbara, as the justice was passing that lady,
          to get to the easy-chair.</p>
  <p>"Hope you are well, madmoselle. Nong parley Frongsey,
          me," said the justice, with an air that seemed to
          say, "And thank goodness that I don't."</p>
  <pb n="318"/>
  <p>Madame Vine could not suppress a smile. "There is no
          necessity, sir. I am not French, but English."</p>
  <p>"Beg pardon," said the justice. "But I heard there was a
          French madam coming here: and I'm sure you look like
          French," he added, staring at her blue spectacles
          and her disfiguring dress. "I shouldn't have taken
          you for English, if you had not told me; but I'm
          glad to hear it. No good ever comes of a French
          governess in one's house. Keep 'em at arm's length,
          say I."</p>
  <p>"Do you think not?" returned Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"I know it," bluntly replied the justice. When our girls
          were young, Anne and Barbara, my wife must needs
          have a French maid for 'em: after that, she must
          have a French governess. I was dubious about it.
          'She'll turn us all papists,' said I, 'and require
          frogs to be served up for her dinner.' But Mrs. Hare
          represented that the girls must learn French, like
          other folks, and I let one come. Two years and some
          months she stopped, and—"</p>
  <p>"And what, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Well, it's not just drawing-room talk. I had a brother
          staying with us most of the time, a post-captain in
          the navy. On the sick-list he was, invalided for
          three years. And we found them out. From nearly the
          first day that French madmoselle put her foot inside
          our door, up to the day I cleared her out of it, a
          nice game they had been carrying on. It gave Mrs.
          Hare a sickener for French jesuits of governesses,
          and I told her she was just served right. When I
          heard that Mrs. Carlyle had engaged a madmoselle for
          these children at East Lynne, I said she wanted her
          ears boxed."</p>
  <pb n="319"/>
  <p>"But, papa, I told you then that Madame Vine was English,
          not French."</p>
  <p>The justice growled some answer, and continued his
          narrative to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"I gave it my brother right and left; in fact, the
          quarrel, we had then, may be said to have lasted his
          life, for he never forgave me. He returned to
          service, and got his flag early. But he died close
          upon it, and left all his money to Barbara. Like a
          donkey, as he was."</p>
  <p>"The effects of the quarrel, you see, papa," laughingly
          said Barbara; the justice thought, saucily.</p>
  <p>"You are in Carlyle's hands now, and not in mine, or I'd
          tell you what I think of that speech, ma'am," was
          the grim retort to Barbara, as the justice once more
          turned to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"You must have seen some of the pranks of these French
          madmoselles, these governesses?"</p>
  <p>"Not very much. I have not been brought into contact with
          them. I am English, as I tell you."</p>
  <p>"And a good thing for you, ma'am, I should say," returned
          the justice, in his abrupt bluntness. "But the
          mistake was natural, you must see. Being called by a
          French title, and living in France, or some of those
          outlandish places over the water, one could but take
          you for French. If I set up my quarters in France
          and called myself Mosseer, I'd forgive the very
          dickens himself, if he mistook me for a French
          frog."</p>
  <p>Lucy clapped her hands, and laughed in merriment.</p>
  <p>"You may laugh, Miss Lucy: but I can tell you, you'd have
          been changed into a frog, or something <pb n="320"/>
          worse, if they had turned you over to a French
          madmoselle. If your poor mother hadn't had a French
          madmoselle of a governess in the first years of her
          life, she'd never have—have—"</p>
  <p>"Have—what?" said Lucy, who was staring with all her
          might at Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>"Done as she did. There! It's out. Barbara, what's this
          nonsense that you have been putting into your
          mamma's head?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know what you mean, papa. I and Archibald want
          her to be with us while you are in London: if you
          allude to that."</p>
  <p>"And are determined to have her, justice," put in Mr.
          Carlyle. "Even though we should have to make a night
          assault on the Grove, and carry her off by
          storm."</p>
  <p>"The Grove, yes," growled Justice Hare. "Much either
          Barbara or you care what becomes of that. A pretty
          high life below stairs there would be, with the
          master and mistress both away! You young ones have
          no more consideration than so many calves."</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa, how can you fancy such things?" uttered
          Barbara. "The Grove would be just as safe and quiet,
          without you and mamma, as with you. The servants are
          all steady, and have been with us a long while."</p>
  <p>"If you want your mamma here for more than a day, why
          can't you get her to come when I am at home."</p>
  <p>"Because she will not leave you; you know that, papa. If
          you are at home, she will be there too. I am sure
          there never was a pattern wife like mamma: if
          Archibald finds me only half such a one, in years to
          come, he may think himself lucky."</p>
  <pb n="321"/>
  <p>The above remark was accompanied by a glance at Mr.
          Carlyle, meant to express saucy independence: but
          her deep love shone out in spite of herself. Mr.
          Carlyle lifted his drooping eyelids, and smiled as
          he nodded to her.</p>
  <p>"Papa, you always have your own way, but you must allow
          us to have ours for once. Mamma wishes to come to
          us: she gave quite a glad start when I proposed it
          to-day: and you must be kind enough not to oppose
          it. The house and servants will go on swimmingly;
          I'll answer for it."</p>
  <p>"Rather too swimmingly," cried Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>"She <hi>requires</hi> a change, sir," said Mr. Carlyle.
          "Think what your wife's inward life is."</p>
  <p>"Fretting after that vagabond! Whose fault is it? Why
          does she do it?"</p>
  <p>"She has been a good and loving wife to you, sir."</p>
  <p>"I didn't say she hadn't."</p>
  <p>"Then encourage her to take this little holiday. The
          change of coming here for a few days will do her
          good; Barbara's society will do her good: remember
          how fond Mrs. Hare is of her."</p>
  <p>"A vast deal fonder than Barbara deserves," retorted the
          justice. "She's as perky as she can be, now she
          thinks she's beyond my correction."</p>
  <p>"She's not beyond mine," said Mr. Carlyle, quite gravely.
          "I assure you, justice, I keep her in order."</p>
  <p>" <hi>I</hi> know," cried the justice, his tone rather
          rough. "You'd kill her with indulgence, before you'd
          keep her in order. That's you, Carlyle."</p>
  <p>The justice thought he could relish a glass of ale, and
          some was brought in. During the slight stir
          occasioned <pb n="322"/> by this, Lady Isabel
          slipped round to Mrs. Carlyle. "Might she retire?
          She believed she was not wanted," and Mrs. Carlyle
          graciously acceded to the request.</p>
  <p>An evening to herself in the grey parlour. A terrible
          evening; one made up of remorse, grief, rebellion,
          and bitter repentance: repentance of the wretched
          past, rebellion at existing things. Between nine and
          ten, she dragged herself up-stairs, purposing to
          retire to rest.</p>
  <p>As she was about to enter her chamber, Sarah, Wilson's
          assistant in the nursery, was passing, and a sudden
          thought occurred to Lady Isabel. "In which room does
          Master Carlyle sleep?" she asked. "Is it on this
          floor?"</p>
  <p>The girl pointed to a door near. "In there, ma'am."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel watched her down stairs and then entered the
          room softly. A little white bed, and William's
          beautiful face lying on it. His cheeks were flushed,
          his hands were thrown out, as if with inward fever;
          but he was sleeping quietly. By the bedside stood a
          saucer, some currant jelly in it and a teaspoon;
          there was also a glass of water.</p>
  <p>She glided down upon her knees and let her face rest on
          the bolster beside him, her breath in contact with
          his. Her eyes were wet; but that she might wake him,
          she would have taken the sleeper on to her bosom,
          and caressed him there. Death for him? She could
          hardly think it.</p>
  <p>"My gracious heart alive! Seeing a light here, if I
          didn't think the room was on fire. It did give me a
          turn."</p>
  <p>The speaker was Wilson, who had discerned the <pb n="323"/> light, in passing the door. Lady Isabel sprang up
          as though she had been shot. She feared the
          detection of Wilson and Joyce more than she feared
          that of Mrs. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I am looking at Master William," she said, as calmly as
          she could speak. "Mr. Carlyle appears somewhat
          uneasy respecting his cough. He has a flushed,
          delicate look."</p>
  <p>"It is nothing," returned Wilson. "It's just the look
          that his mother had. The first time I saw her,
          nothing would convince me but what she had got paint
          on."</p>
  <p>"Good night," was all the reply made by Lady Isabel, as
          she retreated to her own room.</p>
  <p>"Good night, madame," replied Wilson, returning towards
          the nursery. "I'll be blest if I know what to think
          of that French governess!" she mentally continued.
          "I hope it may turn out that she's not deranged,
          that's all."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER IV. THEN YOU'LL REMEMBER ME.</head>
  <p><hi>In</hi> a soft grey damask dress, not unlike the
          colour of the walls from which the room took its
          name, a cap of Honiton lace shading her delicate
          features, sat Mrs. Hare. The justice was in London
          with Squire Pinner, and Barbara had gone to the
          Grove, and brought her mamma away in triumph. It was
          evening now, and kind Mrs. Hare was paying a visit
          to the grey parlour. Miss Carlyle had been dining
          there, and Lady Isabel, under plea of a violent
          headache, had begged to decline the invitation to
          take tea in the drawing-room, for she feared the
          sharp eyes of Miss Carlyle. Barbara, upon leaving
          the dessert-table, went to the nursery as usual to
          her baby, and Mrs. Hare took the opportunity to go
          <pb/> and sit a few minutes with the governess; she
          feared that governess must be very lonely. Miss
          Carlyle, scorning usage and ceremony, had remained
          in the dining-room with Mr. Carlyle, a lecture for
          him, upon some defalcation or other, most probably
          in store. Lady Isabel was alone. Lucy had gone to
          keep a birthday in the neighbourhood, and William
          was in the nursery. Mrs. Hare found her in a sad
          attitude, her two hands pressed upon her temples.
          She had not yet made acquaintance with her, beyond a
          formal introduction.</p>
  <p>"I am sorry to hear you are not well this evening," she
          gently said.</p>
  <p>"Thank you. My head aches much"—which was no false
          plea.</p>
  <p>"I fear you must feel your solitude irksome. It is dull
          for you to be here all alone."</p>
  <p>"I am so used to solitude."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare sat down, and gazed with sympathy at the young,
          though somewhat strange-looking woman before her;
          she detected the signs of mental suffering on her
          face. "You have seen sorrow," she uttered, bending
          forward and speaking with the utmost sweetness.</p>
  <p>"Oh, great sorrow," burst from Lady Isabel, for her
          wretched fate was very palpable to her mind that
          evening, and the tone of sympathy rendered it nearly
          irrepressible.</p>
  <p>"My daughter tells me that you have lost your children,
          that you have lost your fortune and position. Indeed
          I feel for you. I wish I could comfort you!"</p>
  <p>This did not decrease her anguish. She completely <pb/>
          lost all self-control, and a gush of tears fell from
          her eyes. "Don't pity me! don't pity me, dear Mrs.
          Hare; indeed it only makes endurance harder. Some of
          us," she added, looking up with a sickly smile, "are
          born to sorrow."</p>
  <p>"We are all born to it," cried Mrs. Hare. "I, in truth,
          have cause to say so. Oh, you know not what my
          portion has been—the terrible weight of grief that I
          have to bear. For many years, I can truly say that I
          have not known one completely happy moment."</p>
  <p>"All have not to bear this killing sorrow," said Lady
          Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Rely upon it, sorrow of some nature comes sooner or
          later to all. In the brightest lot on earth, dark
          days must mix. Not that there is a doubt but that it
          falls unequally. Some, as you observe, seem born to
          it, for it clings to them all their days: others are
          more favoured. As we reckon favour: perhaps this
          great amount of trouble is no more than is necessary
          to take us to heaven. You know the saying;
          'Adversity hardens the heart, or it opens it to
          Paradise.' It may be, that our hearts are so hard,
          that the long-continued life's trouble is requisite
          to soften them. My dear," Mrs. Hare added, in a
          lower tone, while the tears glistened on her pale
          cheeks, "there will be a blessed rest for the weary,
          when this toilsome life is ended: let us find
          comfort in that thought."</p>
  <p>"Ay! ay!" murmured Lady Isabel. "It is all that is left
          to me."</p>
  <p>"You are young, to have acquired so much experience of
          sorrow."</p>
  <p>"We cannot estimate sorrow by years. We may <pb/> live a
          whole lifetime of it in a single hour. But we
          generally bring ill fate upon ourselves," she
          continued, in a desperation of remorse: "as our
          conduct is, so will our happiness or misery be."</p>
  <p>"Not always," sighed Mrs. Hare. "Sorrow, I grant you,
          comes all too frequently from ill doing: but the
          worst is, that the consequences of this wrong doing
          fall upon the innocent as well as upon the guilty. A
          husband's errors will involve his innocent wife; the
          sins of the parents will fall upon their children;
          children will break the hearts of their parents. I
          can truly say—speaking in all humble submission—that
          I am unconscious of having deserved the great sorrow
          which came upon me; that no act of mine invited it;
          but, though it has nearly killed me, I entertain no
          doubt that it is lined with mercy, if I could only
          bring my weak, rebellious heart to look for it. You,
          I feel sure, have been equally undeserving."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare did not mark the flush of shame, the drooping
          of the eye-lids.</p>
  <p>"You have lost your little ones," Mrs. Hare resumed.
          "That is grief; great grief, I would not underrate
          it; but believe me it is as <hi>nothing</hi>
          compared to the awful fate of finding your children
          grow up and become that, which makes you wish they
          had died in their infancy. There are times when I am
          tempted to regret that <hi>all</hi> my treasures are
          not in the next world; that they have not gone
          before me. Yes; sorrow is the lot of all."</p>
  <p>"Surely not of all," dissented Lady Isabel. "There are
          some bright lots on earth."</p>
  <p>"There is not a lot, but must bear its appointed share,"
          returned Mrs. Hare. "Bright as it may appear, <pb/>
          ay, and as it may continue to be for years, depend
          upon it some darkness must overshadow it earlier or
          later."</p>
  <p>"Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle—what sorrow can there be in store
          for them?" asked Lady Isabel, her voice ringing with
          a strange sound: which Mrs. Hare noted, though she
          understood it not.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Carlyle's lot is bright," she said, a sweet smile
          illumining her features. "She loves her husband with
          an impassioned love; and he is worthy of it. A happy
          fate indeed is hers; but she must not expect to be
          exempted from sorrow. Mr. Carlyle has had his share
          of it," concluded Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"Ah!"</p>
  <p>"You have doubtless been made acquainted with his
          history. His first wife left him; left her home and
          her children. He bore it bravely before the world;
          but I know that it wrung his very heart-strings. She
          was his heart's early idol."</p>
  <p>"She! Not Barbara?"</p>
  <p>The moment the word "Barbara" had escaped her lips, Lady
          Isabel recollected herself. She was only Madame
          Vine, the governess: what would Mrs. Hare think of
          her familiarity?</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare did not appear to have noticed it: she was
          absorbed in the subject. "Barbara?" she uttered:
          "certainly not. Had his first love been given to
          Barbara, he would have chosen her then. It was given
          to Lady Isabel."</p>
  <p>"It is given to his wife now."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare nearly laughed. "Of course it is: would you
          wish it to be buried in the grave with the dead?—
          and with one who was false to him? But, my dear,
          <pb/> she was the sweetest woman, that unfortunate
          Lady Isabel. I loved her then, and I cannot help
          loving her still. Others blamed her, but I pitied.
          They were well matched: he, so good and noble; she,
          so lovely and endearing."</p>
  <p>"And she left him; threw him to the winds, with all his
          nobility and love!" exclaimed that poor governess,
          with a gesture of the hands, that looked very like
          despair.</p>
  <p>"Yes. It will not do to talk of: it is a miserable
          subject. How she could abandon such a husband, such
          children, was a marvel to many; but to none more
          than it was to me and my daughter. The false step—
          though I feel almost afraid to speak out the
          thought, lest it may appear to savour of
          triumph—while it must have secured her own
          wretchedness, led to the happiness of my child; for
          it is pretty certain Barbara would never have loved
          another as she loves Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"You think it did secure wretchedness to her?" cried Lady
          Isabel, her tone one of bitter mockery, more than
          anything else.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare was surprised at the question. "No woman ever
          took that step yet, without its entailing on her the
          direst wretchedness," she replied. "It cannot be
          otherwise. And Lady Isabel was of a nature to feel
          remorse, to meet it half way. Refined, modest, with
          every feeling of an English gentlewoman, she was the
          very last one would have expected to act so. It was
          as if she had gone away in a dream, not knowing what
          she was doing: I have thought so many a time. That,
          terrible mental wretchedness and remorse did
          overtake her, I know."</p>
  <pb/>
  <p>"How did you know it? Did you hear it?" exclaimed Lady
          Isabel, her tone all too eager, had Mrs. Hare been
          suspicious. "Did <hi>he</hi> proclaim that—Francis
          Levison? Did you hear it from him?"</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare, gentle Mrs. Hare, drew herself up, for the
          words grated on her feelings and on her pride.
          Another moment, and she was mild and kind again, for
          she reflected that that poor sorrowful governess
          must have spoken without thought.</p>
  <p>"I know not what Sir Francis Levison may have chosen to
          proclaim," she said, "but you may be sure he would
          not be allowed opportunity to proclaim anything to
          me, or to any other friend of Mr. Carlyle's; nay, I
          should say, nor to any one good and honourable. I
          heard it from Lord Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"From Lord Mount Severn!" repeated Lady Isabel. And she
          opened her lips to say something more, but closed
          them again.</p>
  <p>"He was here on a visit in the summer; he stayed a
          fortnight. Lady Isabel was the daughter of the late
          earl—perhaps you may not have known that. He— Lord
          Mount Severn—told me, in confidence, that he had
          sought out Lady Isabel when the man, Levison, left
          her: he found her sick, poor, broken-hearted, in
          some remote French town, utterly borne down with
          remorse and repentance."</p>
  <p>"Could it be otherwise?" sharply asked Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"My dear, I have said it could not. The very thought of
          her deserted children would entail it, if nothing
          else did. There was a baby born abroad," added Mrs.
          Hare, dropping her voice, "an infant <pb/> in its
          cradle then, Lord Mount Severn said: but that child,
          we know, could only bring pain and shame."</p>
  <p>"True," issued from her trembling lips.</p>
  <p>"Next, came her death: and I cannot but think it was sent
          to her in mercy. I trust she was prepared for it,
          and had made her peace with God. When all else is
          taken from us, we turn to him: I hope she had
          learned to find the Refuge."</p>
  <p>"How did Mr. Carlyle receive the news of her death?"
          murmured Lady Isabel, a question which had been
          often in her thoughts.</p>
  <p>"I cannot tell: he made no outward sign, either of
          satisfaction or grief. It was too delicate a subject
          for any one to enter upon with him, and most
          assuredly he did not enter upon it himself. After he
          was engaged to my child, he told me that he should
          never have married during Lady Isabel's life."</p>
  <p>"From—from—the remains of affection?"</p>
  <p>"I should think not. I inferred it to be from
          conscientious scruples. All his affection is given
          to his present wife. There is no doubt that he loves
          her with a true, a fervent, a lasting love: though
          there perhaps was more romantic sentiment in the
          early passion felt for Lady Isabel. Poor thing! she
          gave up a sincere heart, a happy home."</p>
  <p>Ay, poor thing! She had very nearly wailed forth her vain
          despair.</p>
  <p>"I wonder whether the drawing-room is tenanted yet,"
          smiled Mrs. Hare, breaking a pause which had ensued.
          "If so, I suppose they will be expecting me
          there."</p>
  <pb/>
  <p>"I will ascertain for you," said Lady Isabel, speaking in
          the impulse of the moment: for she was craving an
          instant to herself, even though it were but in the
          hall.</p>
  <p>She quitted the grey parlour and approached the
          drawing-room. Not a sound came from it; and,
          believing it was empty, she opened the door and
          looked cautiously in.</p>
  <p>Quite empty. The fire blazed, the chandelier was lighted,
          but nobody was enjoying the warmth or the light.
          From the inner room, however, came the sound of the
          piano, and the tones of Mr. Carlyle's voice. She
          recognised the chords of the music: they were those
          of the accompaniment to the song he had so loved
          when she sang it to him. Who was about to sing it to
          him now?</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel stole across the drawing-room to the other
          door, which was ajar. Barbara was seated at the
          piano, and Mr. Carlyle stood by her, his arm on her
          chair, and bending his face on a level with hers,
          possibly to look at the music. So, once had stolen,
          so, once had peeped the unhappy Barbara, to hear
          this self-same song. <hi>She</hi> had been his wife
          then; she had received his kisses when it was over.
          Their positions were reversed.</p>
  <p>Barbara began. Her voice had not the brilliant power of
          Lady Isabel's, but it was a sweet and pleasant voice
          to listen to.</p>
  <pb n="10"/>
  <p>Days that had as happy been! Ay. <hi>Did</hi> he remember
          her? Did a thought of her, his first and best love,
          flit across him, as the words fell on his ear? Did a
          past vision of the time when she sat there and sung
          it to him, arouse his heart to even a momentary
          recollection?</p>
  <p>Terribly, indeed, were their positions reversed; most
          terribly was she feeling it. And by whose act and
          will had the change been wrought? Barbara was now
          the honoured and cherished wife, East Lynne's
          mistress. And what was she? Not even the welcomed
          guest of an hour, as Barbara had then been: but an
          interloper; a criminal woman who had thrust herself
          into the house; her act, in doing so, not
          justifiable, her position a most false one. Was it
          right, even if she should succeed in remaining
          undiscovered, that she and Barbara should dwell in
          the same habitation, Mr. Carlyle being in it? Did
          she deem it to be right? No, she did not: but one
          act of ill-doing entails more. These thoughts were
          passing through her mind as she stood there,
          listening to the song; stood there as one turned to
          stone, her throbbing temples pressed against the
          door's pillar.</p>
  <p>The song was over, and Barbara turned to her husband, a
          whole world of love in her bright blue eyes. He laid
          his hand upon her head; Lady Isabel saw that, but
          she would not wait to see the caress that most
          probably followed it. She turned and crossed the
          room <pb n="11"/> again, her hands clasped tightly
          on her bosom, her breath catching itself in
          hysterical sobs. Miss Carlyle was entering from the
          hall. They had not yet met, and Lady Isabel swept
          meekly past her with a hurried curtsey. Miss Carlyle
          spoke, but she dared not answer: to wait, would have
          been to betray herself.</p>
  <p>Sunday came, and that was the worst of all. In the old
          East Lynne pew at St. Jude's, so conspicuous to the
          congregation, sat she, as in former times: no excuse
          dared she, the governess, make, to remain away. It
          was the first time she had entered an English
          Protestant church, since she had last sat in it,
          there, with Mr. Carlyle. That fact alone, with all
          the terrible remembrances it brought in its train,
          was sufficient to overwhelm her with emotion. She
          sat at the upper end now, with Lucy; Barbara
          occupied the place that had been hers, by the side
          of Mr. Carlyle. Barbara there, in her own right, his
          wife: she, severed from him for ever and for
          ever!</p>
  <p>She scarcely raised her head; she tightened her thick
          veil over her face; she kept her spectacles bent
          towards the ground. Lucy thought she must be crying:
          she had never seen any one so still at church
          before. Lucy was mistaken: tears come not to solace
          the bitter anguish of hopeless, self-condemning
          remorse. How she sat out the service, she could not
          tell: she could not tell how she should sit out
          other services, as the Sundays came round. The
          congregation did not forget to stare at her: what an
          extraordinary looking governess Mrs. Carlyle had
          picked up!</p>
  <p>They went out when it was over. Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle in
          advance; she, humbly following them, with <pb n="12"/> Lucy. She glanced aside at the tomb in the
          churchyard's corner, where mouldered the remains of
          her father; and a yearning cry went forth from the
          very depth of her soul. "Oh, that I were laid there
          with him! Why did I come back again to East
          Lynne?"</p>
  <p>Why, truly? But she had never thought that her cross
          would be so sharp as this.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER V. AN M. P. FOR WEST LYNNE.</head>
  <p><hi>As</hi> this is not a history of the British
          constitution, it is not necessary to relate how or
          why West Lynne got into hot water with the House of
          Commons. The House threatened to disenfranchise it,
          and West Lynne, under the fear, went in mourning for
          its sins. The threat was not carried out; but one of
          the sitting members was unseated with ignominy, and
          sent to the right about. Being considerably
          humiliated thereby, and in disgust with West Lynne,
          he retired accordingly, and a fresh writ was issued.
          West Lynne then returned the Honourable Mr. Attley,
          a county nobleman's son, but he died in the very
          midst of his first session, and another writ had to
          be issued.</p>
  <p>Of course the consideration now was, who should be the
          next candidate. All the notables within ten miles
          were discussed, not excepting the bench of justices.
          Mr. Justice Hare? No: he was too uncompromising;
          would study his own will, but not that of West
          Lynne. Squire Pinner? He never made a speech in his
          life, and had not an idea beyond turnips and farming
          stock. Colonel Bethel? He had no money to spend upon
          an election. Sir John Dobede? He was <pb n="14"/>
          too old. "By a good twenty years," laughed Sir John,
          himself. "But here we stand, like a pack of noodles,
          conning over the incapables, and passing by the
          right one," continued Sir John. "There's only one
          man amongst us fit to be our member."</p>
  <p>"Who's that?" cried the meeting.</p>
  <p>"Archibald Carlyle."</p>
  <p>A pause of consternation; consternation at their
          collective forgetfulness: and then, a murmur of
          approbation, approaching to a shout, filled the
          room. Archibald Carlyle. It should be no other.</p>
  <p>"If we can get him," cried Sir John. "He may decline, you
          know."</p>
  <p>All agreed that the best thing was to act promptly. A
          deputation, half the length of the street—its whole
          length, if you include the tagrag and bobtail that
          attended behind—set off, on the spur of the moment,
          to the office of Mr. Carlyle. They found that
          gentleman about to leave it for the evening, to
          return home to dinner. For, in the discussion of the
          all-important topic, the meeting had suffered time
          to run on to a late hour; those gentlemen who dined
          at a somewhat earlier one, had for once in their
          lives patiently allowed their dinners and their
          stomachs to wait—which is saying a great deal for
          the patience of a justice.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was taken by surprise. "Make me your member?"
          cried he, merrily. "How do you know I should not
          sell you all?"</p>
  <p>"We'll trust you, Carlyle. Too happy to do it."</p>
  <p>"I am not sure that I could spare the time," deliberated
          Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Now, Carlyle, you must remember that you <pb n="15"/>
          avowed to me, no longer ago than last Christmas,
          your intention of going into parliament some time,"
          struck in Mr. Justice Herbert. "You can't deny
          it."</p>
  <p>"Some time!—yes," replied Mr. Carlyle. "But I did not say
          when. I have no thoughts of it yet awhile."</p>
  <p>"You must allow us to put you in nomination, you must
          indeed, Mr. Carlyle. There's nobody else fit for it.
          As good send a pig to the House, as some of us."</p>
  <p>"An extremely flattering reason for proposing to shift
          the honour upon me," laughed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Well, you know what we mean, Carlyle. There's not a man
          in the whole county so suitable as you, search it
          through: you must know there is not."</p>
  <p>"I don't know anything of the sort," returned Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"At any rate, we are determined to have you. When you
          walk into West Lynne to-morrow, you'll see the walls
          alive with placards, 'Carlyle for ever!'"</p>
  <p>"Suppose you allow me until to-morrow to consider of it,
          and defer the garnishing of the walls a day later,"
          said Mr. Carlyle, a serious tone peeping out in the
          midst of his jocularity.</p>
  <p>"You do not fear the expense?"</p>
  <p>It was but a glance he returned in answer. As soon as the
          question had been put—it was stupid old Pinner who
          propounded it—they had felt how foolish it was. And
          indeed the cost would be a mere nothing, were there
          no opposition.</p>
  <p>"Come, decide now, Carlyle. Give us your promise."</p>
  <pb n="16"/>
  <p>"If I decide now, it will be in the negative," replied
          Mr. Carlyle. "It is a question that demands
          consideration. Give me till to-morrow for that, and
          it is possible that I may accede to your
          request."</p>
  <p>This was the best that could be made of him: the
          deputation backed out, and, as nothing more could be
          done, departed to their several dinner tables. Mr.
          Dill, who had been present, remained rubbing his
          hands with satisfaction, and casting admiring
          glances at Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"What's the matter, Dill?" asked the latter. "You look as
          though you were pleased at this movement, and
          assumed that I should accept it."</p>
  <p>"And so you will, Mr. Archibald. And as to looking
          pleased, there's not a man, woman, or child in West
          Lynne who won't be glad."</p>
  <p>"Don't make too sure, Dill."</p>
  <p>"Of what, sir?—of your becoming our member, or of the
          people looking pleased?"</p>
  <p>"Of either," laughed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>He quitted the office to walk home, revolving the
          proposition as he did so. That he had long thought
          of sometime entering parliament, was certain; though
          no definite period of the "when" had fixed itself in
          his mind. He did not see why he should confine his
          days entirely to toil, to the work of its calling.
          Pecuniary considerations did not require it, for his
          realised property, combined with the fortune brought
          by Barbara, was quite sufficient to meet expenses,
          according to their present style of living. Not that
          he had the least intention of giving up his
          business; it was honourable (as he conducted it) and
          lucrative; and he really liked it: <pb n="17"/> he
          would not have been condemned to lead an idle life
          for the world. But there was no necessity for his
          being always at it. Mr. Dill made as good a
          principal as he did, and—if length of service and
          experience might be counted—a better one. He could
          safely be left to manage, during the time it would
          be necessary for Mr. Carlyle to be in London. He
          would rather represent West Lynne than any other
          spot on the face of the earth, no matter what might
          be that other's importance; and as West Lynne was
          now in want of a member, perhaps his opportunity had
          come. That he would make a good and efficient public
          servant, he believed; his talents were superior, his
          oratory was persuasive, and he had the gift of a
          true and honest spirit. That he would have the
          interest of West Lynne at heart, was certain, and he
          knew that he should serve his constituents to the
          very best of his power and ability. They knew it
          also.</p>
  <p>Before Mr. Carlyle had reached East Lynne, he had decided
          that it should be.</p>
  <p>It was a fine spring evening, for the months had gone on.
          The lilac was in bloom, the hedges and trees were
          clothed in their early green, all things seemed full
          of promise. Even Mr. Carlyle's heart was rejoicing
          in the prospect opened to it: he was sure he should
          like a public life. But, in the sanguine moments of
          realisation or of hope, some dark shade will step in
          to mar the brightness.</p>
  <p>Barbara stood at the drawing-room window watching for
          him. Not in her was the dark shade. Her dress was a
          marvel of vanity and prettiness, and she had chosen
          to place on her fair hair a dainty head-dress of
          lace. As if her hair required such adornment! She
            <pb n="18"/> waltzed up to Mr. Carlyle when he
          entered, and saucily held up her face, the light of
          love dancing in her bright blue eyes.</p>
  <p>"What do you want?" he provokingly asked, putting his
          hands behind him and letting her stand there.</p>
  <p>"Oh, well—if you won't say good evening to me! I have a
          great mind to say you should not kiss me for a week,
          Archibald."</p>
  <p>He laughed. "Who would be most punished by that?"
          whispered he.</p>
  <p>Barbara pouted her pretty lips, and the tears positively
          came to her eyes. "Which is as much as to say it
          would be no punishment to you. Archibald!
            <hi>don't</hi> you care for me?"</p>
  <p>He threw his arms round her, and clasped her to his
          heart, taking plenty of kisses then. "You know
          whether I care or not," he fondly whispered.</p>
  <p>But now, will you believe that that unfortunate Lady
          Isabel had been a witness to this? Well? it was only
          what his greeting to her had once been. Her pale
          face flushed scarlet, and she glided out of the room
          again as softly as she had entered it. They had not
          seen her. Mr. Carlyle drew his wife to the window,
          and stood there, his arm round her waist.</p>
  <p>"Barbara, what should you say to living in London for a
          few months out of the twelve?"</p>
  <p>"London? I am very happy where I am. Why should you ask
          me that? You are not going to live in London."</p>
  <p>"I am not sure of that. I think I am, for a portion of
          the year. I have had an offer made me this
          afternoon, Barbara."</p>
  <pb n="19"/>
  <p>She looked at him, wondering what he meant; wondering
          whether he was serious. An offer to him? What sort
          of an offer? Of what nature could it be?</p>
  <p>He smiled at her perplexity, "Should you like to see M.
          P. attached to my name? West Lynne wants me to
          become its member."</p>
  <p>A pause to take in the news; a sudden rush of colour; and
          then she gleefully clasped her hands round his arm,
          her eyes sparkling with pleasure.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald, how glad I am! I knew you were
          appreciated; and you will be appreciated more and
          more. This is right: it was not well for
            <hi>you</hi> to remain for life a private
          individual, a country lawyer."</p>
  <p>"I am perfectly contented with my lot, Barbara," he said
          seriously, "I am too busy to be otherwise."</p>
  <p>"I know that were you but a labouring man, toiling daily
          for the bread you eat, you would be contented,
          feeling that you were fulfilling your appointed duty
          to the utmost: but, Archibald, could you not still
          be a busy man at West Lynne, although you should
          become its representative?"</p>
  <p>"If I could not, I would not accept the honour, Barbara.
          For some few months of the year, I must of necessity
          be in town, but Dill is an efficient substitute; and
          I can run down for a week or so, between times. Part
          of Saturday, Sunday, and part of Monday I can always
          pass here, if I please. Of course, these changes
          have their drawbacks, as well as their
          advantages."</p>
  <p>"Where would be the drawbacks in this?" she
          interrupted.</p>
  <pb n="20"/>
  <p>"Well," smiled Mr. Carlyle, "in the first place, I
          suppose you could not always be with me."</p>
  <p>Her hands fell; her colour faded. "Oh, Archibald!"</p>
  <p>"If I do become their member, I must go up to town as
          soon as elected: and I don't think it will do for my
          little wife to be quitting her home to travel about
          just now."</p>
  <p>Barbara's face wore a very blank look. She could not
          dissent from Mr. Carlyle's reasoning.</p>
  <p>"And you must remain in London to the end of the session,
          while I am here! Separated! Archibald," she
          passionately added, while the tears gushed into her
          eyes; "I could not <hi>live</hi> without you."</p>
  <p>"Then what is to be done? Must I decline it?"</p>
  <p>"Decline it! Oh, of course not. I know: we are looking on
          the dark side of things. I can go very well with you
          for a month, perhaps two."</p>
  <p>"You think so?"</p>
  <p>"I am sure so. And, mind! you must not encourage mamma to
          talk me out of it. Archibald," she continued,
          resting her head upon his breast, her sweet face
          turned up beseechingly to his, "you would rather
          have me with you, would you not?"</p>
  <p>He bent his own down upon it. "What do you think about
          it, my darling?"</p>
  <p>Once more, an inopportune moment for her to enter —Lady
          Isabel. Barbara heard her this time, and sprang away
          from her husband. Mr. Carlyle turned round at the
          movement, and saw Madame Vine. She came forward; her
          lips ashy, her voice subdued.</p>
  <p>She had now been six months at East Lynne, and had
          hitherto escaped detection. Time and familiarity
          render us accustomed to most things, to danger
          amongst <pb n="21"/> the rest; and she had almost
          ceased to fear recognition. She and the children
          were upon the best terms: she had greatly endeared
          herself to them, and they loved her: perhaps nature
          was asserting her own hidden claims.</p>
  <p>What of William? William had been better through the
          winter, but with the first blush of spring he had
          begun to fade again. He was constantly weary, had
          frequent pain in his side, and his appetite failed.
          Mr. Wainwright attended him daily now. In the day he
          looked tolerably well, for the exceeding beauty and
          brightness of his complexion disarmed suspicion;
          but, towards evening, so soon as twilight came on,
          his illness showed itself outwardly. His face would
          be of a pallid whiteness, he could scarcely speak
          for weakness, and his favourite resting-place was
          the hearth-rug in the grey parlour. There he would
          lie down at full length, a cushion under his head,
          and his eyes closed.</p>
  <p>"My child," Madame Vine would say to him, "you would be
          better on the sofa."</p>
  <p>"No. I like this."</p>
  <p>"But, if I draw it quite close to the fire for you? Try
          it, William."</p>
  <p>He did, one or two evenings: and then the old place was
          resumed, and he would not quit it. He was lying
          there as usual on this evening when Hannah came in
          with the tea-things. She gazed down for a minute or
          two at the boy, whom she supposed to be sleeping, so
          still and full of repose did he look, and then
          turned to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"Poor child! he's one that's going fast on to his
          grave."</p>
  <p>The words utterly startled her. Daily familiarity <pb n="22"/> with illness sometimes renders us
          partially blind to its worst features, and thus it
          had been with Lady Isabel. Upon her arrival at East
          Lynne, she had been, if not alarmed, much concerned
          at the appearance of William: the winter improvement
          had dispelled that concern; while the spring change
          had come on so gradually that her fears had not
          taken alarm. She judged him to be a delicate boy,
          one who required care.</p>
  <p>"Hannah!" she uttered, in a tone of reproof, to the
          servant.</p>
  <p>"Why, ma'am, I wonder that you can't see it yourself!"
          returned Hannah. "It's plain, poor lad, that he has
          no mother, or there would have been an outcry over
          him long ago. Of course, Mrs. Carlyle can't be
          expected to have the feelings of one for him: and as
          to old Wainwright, he's as blind as any bat."</p>
  <p>She took the reproach to herself, and it smote upon her
          heart: had <hi>she</hi> been blind; she, his
          mother?</p>
  <p>"There is nothing particular the matter with him, Hannah.
          He is only weakly." But she spoke these words in
          braving defiance of her thoughts; anxious, if we may
          so say it, to deceive herself: even as she gave
          expression to them, her pulses were going pit-a-pat
          with the fear, the next to certainty, that there was
          worse the matter with him.</p>
  <p>"Are you asleep, William?" she softly said, bending down
          towards him.</p>
  <p>No reply. No movement in answer.</p>
  <p>"He might not have been asleep, Hannah. You should be
          more cautious in your remarks."</p>
  <p>"Anybody may see that he's asleep, ma'am, lying so <pb n="23"/> still as that. Of course I wouldn't say
          anything in his hearing."</p>
  <p>"Why do you fancy him to be in a critical state?"</p>
  <p>"It is not fancy," returned Hannah. "I have had some
          experience in fading children."</p>
  <p>Lucy entered at this juncture, and nothing more was said.
          When Hannah quitted the room, Lady Isabel gazed down
          at William, as if she would have devoured him, a
          yearning, famished sort of expression upon her
          features. He was white as death. The blue veins were
          conspicuous in his face, and his nostrils were
          slightly working with every breath he drew, as will
          be the case with the sickly. From passive security
          she had jumped to the other extreme, for Hannah's
          words had roused every fear within her.</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine, why are you looking like that at William?"
          asked Lucy, who was watching.</p>
  <p>"Hannah thinks he is ill," she mechanically answered. Her
          reflections were buried five fathoms deep, and she
          was debating whether she ought not on that very
          instant to make known these new fears to Mr.
          Carlyle. To <hi>Mr.</hi> Carlyle, you observe: her
          jealous heart would not recognise the right of Mrs.
          Carlyle over her children—although she had to submit
          to its exercise.</p>
  <p>She quitted the parlour. She had heard Mr. Carlyle come
          in. Crossing the hall, she tapped softly at the
          drawing-room door, and then as softly entered. It
          was the moment of Mr. Carlyle's fond greeting to his
          wife. They stood together, heedless of her.</p>
  <p>Gliding out again, she paced the hall, her hands pressed
          upon her beating heart. How <hi>dared</hi> that
          heart <pb n="24"/> rise up in sharp rebellion at
          these witnessed tokens of love? Was Barbara not his
          wife? Had she not a legal claim to all his
          tenderness? Who was she, that she should resent them
          in her sick jealousy? What, though they had once
          been hers, hers only; had she not signed and sealed
          her own forfeit of them, and so made room for
          Barbara?</p>
  <p>Back to the grey parlour, there she stood, her elbow on
          the mantel-piece, her eyes hidden by her hand. Thus
          she remained for some minutes, and Lucy thought how
          sad she looked.</p>
  <p>But Lucy felt hungry, and was casting longing glances
          towards the tea-table. She wondered how long her
          governess meant to keep it waiting. "Madame Vine,"
          cried she, presently, "don't you know that tea is
          ready?"</p>
  <p>This caused Madame Vine to raise her eyes. They fell upon
          the pale boy at her feet. She made no immediate
          answer, only placed her hand on Lucy's shoulder.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Lucy dear, I—I have many sorrows to bear."</p>
  <p>"The tea will warm you, and there's some nice jam," was
          Miss Lucy's offered consolation.</p>
  <p>"Their greeting, tender as it may be, is surely over by
          this time," thought Lady Isabel, an expression
          something like mockery curving her lips. "I will
          venture again."</p>
  <p>Only to see him with his wife's face on his breast, and
          his own lips bent upon it. But they had heard her
          this time, and she had to advance, in spite of her
          spirit of misery and her whitened features.</p>
  <pb n="25"/>
  <p>"Would you be so good, sir, as to come and look at
          William?" she asked, in a low tone, of Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Certainly."</p>
  <p>"What for?" interjected Barbara.</p>
  <p>"He looks so very ill. I do not like his looks. I fear he
          is worse than we have thought."</p>
  <p>They went to the grey parlour, all three of them. Mr.
          Carlyle was there first, and had taken a long,
          silent look at William before the others
          entered.</p>
  <p>"What is he doing on the floor?" exclaimed Barbara, in
          her astonishment. "He should not lie on the floor,
          Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>"He lies down there at the dusk hour, and I cannot get
          him up again. I try to persuade him to the sofa, but
          it is of no use."</p>
  <p>"The floor will not hurt him," said Mr. Carlyle.
            <hi>This</hi> was the dark shade: his boy's
          failing health.</p>
  <p>William opened his eyes. "Who's that? Papa?"</p>
  <p>"Don't you feel well; William?"</p>
  <p>"Oh yes, I'm very well; but I am tired."</p>
  <p>"Why do you lie down here?"</p>
  <p>"I like lying here. Papa, that pretty white rabbit of
          mine is dead."</p>
  <p>"Indeed. Suppose you get up and tell me all about
          it."</p>
  <p>"I don't know about it myself yet," said William, slowly
          rising. "Blair told Lucy when she was out just now;
          I did not go; I was tired. He said—"</p>
  <p>"What has tired you?" interrupted Mr. Carlyle, taking the
          boy's hand.</p>
  <p>"Oh, nothing. I am always tired!"</p>
  <pb n="26"/>
  <p>"Do you tell Mr. Wainwright that you are tired?"</p>
  <p>"No. Why should I tell him? I wish he would not order me
          to take that nasty medicine, that cod liver
          oil."</p>
  <p>"But it is to make you strong, my boy."</p>
  <p>"It makes me sick. I always feel sick after it, papa.
          Madame Vine says I ought to have cream. That would
          be nice."</p>
  <p>"Cream?" repeated Mr. Carlyle, turning his eyes on Madame
          Vine.</p>
  <p>"I have known cream to do a vast deal of good in a case
          like William's," she observed. "I believe that no
          better medicine can be given; that it has, in fact,
          no substitute."</p>
  <p>"It can be tried," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Pray give your orders, Madame Vine, for anything you
          think may be beneficial to him," added Mrs. Carlyle.
          "You have had more experience with children than I.
          Joyce—"</p>
  <p>"What does Wainwright say?" interrupted Mr. Carlyle,
          speaking to his wife, his tone low.</p>
  <p>"I do not always see him when he comes, Archibald. Madame
          Vine does, I believe."</p>
  <p>"Oh dear!" cried Lucy, "can't we have tea? I want some
          bread-and-jam."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle turned round, smiled, and nodded at her.
          "Patience is good for little girls, Miss Lucy. Would
          you like some bread-and-jam, my boy?"</p>
  <p>William shook his head. "I can't eat jam. I am only
          thirsty."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle cast a long and intent look at him, and <pb n="27"/> then left the room. Lady Isabel followed
          him, her thoughts full of her ailing child.</p>
  <p>"Do you think him very ill, sir?" she whispered.</p>
  <p>"I think he looks so. What does Mr. Wainwright say?"</p>
  <p>"He says nothing to me. I have not inquired his true
          opinion. Until to-night, it did not occur to me that
          there was danger."</p>
  <p>"Does he look so much worse to-night?"</p>
  <p>"Not any worse than usual. Latterly he has looked just
          like this in an evening. It was a remark of Hannah's
          that aroused my alarm: she thinks he is on the road
          to death. What can we do to save him?"</p>
  <p>She clasped her hands, as she spoke, in the intensity of
          her emotion: she almost forgot, as they stood there
          together talking of the welfare of the child, their
          child, that he was no longer her husband. Almost;
          not quite; utterly impossible would it be for her
          wholly to forget the dreadful present. Neither he
          nor the child could belong to her again in this
          world.</p>
  <p>A strange rising of the throat in her wild despair, a
          meek curtsey as she turned from him, his last words
          ringing in her ears. "I shall call in further advice
          for him, Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>William was clinging round Mrs. Carlyle in a coaxing
          attitude, when she re-entered the grey parlour. "I
          know what I could eat, mamma, if you would let me
          have it," cried he, in answer to her remonstrance
          that he must eat something.</p>
  <p>"What could you eat?"</p>
  <p>"Some cheese."</p>
  <p>"Cheese! Cheese with tea!" laughed Mrs. Carlyle.</p>
  <pb n="28"/>
  <p>"For the last week or two he has fancied strange
          things—the effect of a diseased appetite," explained
          Madame Vine. "But if I allow them to be brought in,
          he barely tastes them."</p>
  <p>"I am sure, mamma, I could eat some cheese now," said
          William.</p>
  <p>"You may have it," answered Mrs. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>As she turned to leave the room, the impatient knock and
          ring of a visitor was heard. Barbara wondered who
          could be arriving at that, their dinner hour.
          Sailing majestically into the hall, her lips
          compressed, her aspect threatening, came Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Now, it turned out that Miss Corny had been standing at
          her own window, grimly eyeing the ill doings of the
          street, from the fine housemaid opposite, who was
          enjoying a flirtation with the baker, to the ragged
          urchins pitchpoling in the gutter and the dust: and
          there she caught sight of the string, justices and
          others, who came out of the office of Mr. Carlyle.
          So many of them were they, that Miss Corny
          involuntarily thought of a conjuror flinging flowers
          out of a hat: the faster they come, the more it
          seems there are to come. "What on earth's up?" cried
          Miss Corny, pressing her nose flat against the pane,
          that she might see the better.</p>
  <p>They filed off, some one way, some another. Miss
          Carlyle's curiosity was keener than her appetite,
          for she remained at the window, although just
          informed that her dinner was served. Presently Mr.
          Carlyle appeared, and she knocked on the window with
          her knuckles. He did not hear it; he had turned off
          at a quick pace towards his home. Miss Corny's
          temper rose.</p>
  <p>The clerks came out next, one after another; and the <pb n="29"/> last was Mr. Dill. He was less hurried
          than Mr. Carlyle had been, and heard Miss Corny's
          signal.</p>
  <p>"What, in the name of wonder, did all those people want
          at the office?" began she, when Mr. Dill had entered
          in obedience to it.</p>
  <p>"That was the deputation, Miss Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"What deputation?"</p>
  <p>"The deputation to Mr. Archibald. They want him to become
          their new member."</p>
  <p>"Member of what?" cried she, not guessing at the actual
          meaning.</p>
  <p>"Of parliament, Miss Corny; to replace Mr. Attley. The
          gentlemen came to solicit him to be put in
          nomination."</p>
  <p>"Solicit a donkey!" irascibly uttered Miss Corny, for the
          tidings did not meet her approbation. "Did Archibald
          turn them out again?"</p>
  <p>"He gave them no direct answer, ma'am. He will consider
          of it between now and to-morrow morning."</p>
  <p>" <hi>Consider</hi> of it?" shrieked she. "Why, he'd
          never, never be such a flat as to comply! He go into
          parliament! What next?"</p>
  <p>"Why should he not, Miss Corny? I'm sure I should be
          proud to see him there."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny gave a sniff. "You are proud of things more
          odd than even, John Dill. Remember that fine
          shirt-front! What has become of it? Is it laid up in
          lavender?"</p>
  <p>"Not exactly in lavender, Miss Corny. It lies in the
          drawer; for I have never liked to put it on since,
          after what you said."</p>
  <p>"Why don't you sell it at half price, and buy a <pb n="30"/> couple of good useful shirts with the
          money?" returned she, tartly. "Better that, than
          keep the foppish thing as a witness of your folly.
          Perhaps <hi>he'll</hi> be buying embroidered fronts
          next, if he goes into that idle, do-nothing House of
          Commons. I'd rather enter myself for six months at
          the treadmill."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Miss Corny! I don't think you have well considered
          it. It's a great honour, and worthy of him: he will
          be elevated above us all: and he deserves to
          be."</p>
  <p>"Elevate him on to a weathercock," raged Miss Corny.
          "There! you may go. I have heard quite enough."</p>
  <p>Brushing past the old gentleman, leaving him to depart,
          or not, as he might please, Miss Carlyle strode
          up-stairs, flung on her shawl and bonnet, and strode
          down again. Her servant looked considerably
          surprised, and addressed her as she crossed the
          hall.</p>
  <p>"Your dinner, ma'am?" he ventured to say.</p>
  <p>"What's my dinner to you?" returned Miss Corny, in her
          wrath. "You have had yours."</p>
  <p>Away she strode. And thus it happened that she was at
          East Lynne almost as soon as Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Where's Archibald?" began she, without ceremony, the
          moment she saw Barbara.</p>
  <p>"He is here. Is anything the matter?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, hearing the voice, came out, and she pounced
          upon him with her tongue.</p>
  <p>"What's this about your becoming the new member for West
          Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"West Lynne wishes it," said Mr. Carlyle. "Sit down,
          Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"Sit down yourself," retorted she, keeping on her <pb n="31"/> feet. "I want my questions answered.
            <hi>Of course</hi> you will decline."</p>
  <p>"On the contrary, I have made up my mind to accept."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny untied the strings of her bonnet and flung
          them behind her. "Have you counted the cost?" she
          asked, and there was something quite sepulchral in
          her solemn tone.</p>
  <p>"I have given it consideration, Cornelia: both as regards
          money and time. The expense will be not worth
          naming, should there be no opposition. And if there
          is—"</p>
  <p>"Ay!" groaned Miss Corny. "If there is?"</p>
  <p>"Well? I am not without a few hundreds to spare for the
          plaything," he said, turning upon her the
          good-humoured light of his fine countenance.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle emitted some dismal moans. "That ever I
          should have lived to see this day! To hear money
          talked of as though it were dirt. And what's to
          become of your business?" she sharply added. "Is
          that to run to rack and ruin, while you are kicking
          your heels in that wicked London, under plea of
          being at the House, night after night?"</p>
  <p>"Cornelia," he gravely said, "were I dead, Dill could
          carry on the business just as well as it is being
          carried on now. I might go into a foreign country
          for seven years, and come back to find the business
          as flourishing as ever, for Dill could keep it
          together. And even were the business to drop
          off—though I tell you it will not do so—I am
          independent of it."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle faced tartly round upon Barbara. "Have you
          been setting him on to this?"</p>
  <pb n="32"/>
  <p>"I think he had made up his mind before he spoke to me.
          But," added Barbara, in her truth, "I urged him to
          accept it."</p>
  <p>"Oh! you did! Nicely moped and miserable you'll be here,
          if he goes to London for months upon the stretch!
          You did not think of that, perhaps."</p>
  <p>"But he would not leave me here," said Barbara, her
          eyelashes becoming wet at the thought, as she
          unconsciously moved to her husband's side. "He would
          take me with him."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle made a pause, and looked at them
          alternately.</p>
  <p>"Is that decided?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Of course it is," laughed Mr. Carlyle, willing to joke
          the subject and his sister into good humour. "Would
          you wish to separate man and wife, Cornelia?"</p>
  <p>She made no reply. She rapidly tied her bonnet-strings,
          the ribbon trembling ominously in her fingers.</p>
  <p>"You are not going, Cornelia! You must stay dinner, now
          you are here. It is ready. And we will talk this
          further over afterwards."</p>
  <p>"This has been dinner enough for me for one day," spoke
          she, putting on her gloves. "That I should have
          lived to see my father's son throw up his business,
          and change himself into a lazy, stuck-up parliament
          man!"</p>
  <p>"Do stay and dine with us, Cornelia! I think I can subdue
          your prejudices, if you will let me talk to
          you."</p>
  <p>"If you wanted to talk to me about it, why did you not
          come in when you left the office?" cried Miss Corny,
          in a greater amount of wrath than she had <pb n="33"/> shown yet. And there is no doubt that, in his not
          having done so, lay one of the sore points.</p>
  <p>"I did not think of it," said Mr. Carlyle. "I should have
          come in and told you of it to-morrow morning."</p>
  <p>"I dare say you would," she ironically answered. "Good
          evening to you both." And in spite of their
          persuasions, she quitted the house, and went
          stalking down the avenue.</p>
  <p>Two or three days more, and the address of Mr. Carlyle to
          the inhabitants of West Lynne appeared in the local
          papers, while the walls and posts, convenient, were
          embellished with various coloured placards: "Vote
          for Carlyle." "Carlyle for ever!"</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VI. SIR FRANCIS LEVISON AT HOME.</head>
  <p><hi>Wonders</hi> never cease. Surprises are the lot of
          man. But perhaps a greater surprise had never been
          experienced, by those who knew him, than when it
          went forth to the world that Sir Francis Levison had
          converted himself from—from what he was, into a
          red-hot politician.</p>
  <p>Had he been offered the post of prime minister? Or did
          his conscience smite him?—as was the case with a
          certain gallant captain, renowned in song. Neither
          the one nor the other. The simple fact was, that Sir
          Francis Levison was in a state of pecuniary
          embarrassment, and required something to prop him
          up: some snug sinecure; plenty to get and nothing to
          do.</p>
  <p>"He, in pecuniary embarrassment!" cries the reader. "How
          could that be?" No easier thing "to be" in this
          world, if a man plunges into the amusements,
          favoured by Francis Levison. When he came into his
          fortune, there was a weighty amount to pay for debts
          and damages, a far larger amount than he had
          believed. Not a farthing, beyond what was obliged to
          come to him by entail, did Sir Peter leave him; but,
          of that which remained, he was no sooner in
          possession than he began to squander right and left.
          His marriage intervened, but it did not stop him: on
          the contrary, it was <pb n="35"/> an addition to the
          outlay: and, not contented with living as was
          suitable to his rank, he and his wife set up
          housekeeping in an outrageously costly manner. Added
          to this, he had, since his marriage, entered heart
          and soul into the pretty little pastimes of
          horse-racing, betting, and gambling. Cock-fighting
          he had always patronised.</p>
  <p>The time went on: and things went on; till they could go
          on no longer, and Sir Francis woke up to his
          condition. Every shilling of available money was
          gone, every stiver of unsecured property was parted
          with; debts and duns had taken their place, and
          Francis Levison, the reigning baronet, was far more
          worried and embarrassed than ever had been Francis
          Levison, the obscure and but half-expectant heir. He
          had fallen into the condition formerly described as
          being that of the late Lord Mount Severn. But, while
          the earl had contrived to weather out the storm for
          years, Francis Levison would not be able to weather
          it for as many months: and he knew it.</p>
  <p>Patch himself up, he must. But how? He had tried the
          tables, but luck was against him; he made a
          desperate venture upon the turf, a grand coup, that
          would have set him on his legs for some time, but
          the venture turned out the wrong way, and Sir
          Francis was a defaulter. He began then to think
          there was nothing for it but to drop into some nice
          government nest, where, as I have told you, there
          would be plenty to get and nothing to do. Any place
          with much to do would not suit him, or he it; he was
          too empty-headed for work requiring talent—you may
          have remarked that a man, given to Sir Francis
          Levison's favourite pursuits, generally is.</p>
  <pb n="36"/>
  <p>He dropped into something good—or, that promised to be
          good: nothing less than the secretaryship to Lord
          Headthelot, who swayed the ministers in the Upper
          House. But that he was connexion of Lord
          Headthelot's, he never would have obtained it, and
          very dubiously the minister consented to try him. Of
          course, one condition was, that he should enter
          parliament the first opportunity, his vote to be at
          the disposal of the ministry: rather a shaky
          ministry, and supposed, by some, to be on its last
          legs. And this brings us to the present time.</p>
  <p>In a handsome drawing-room in Eaton-square. one sunny
          afternoon, sat a lady, young and handsome. Her eyes
          were of a violet blue, her hair was auburn, her
          complexion delicate. But there was a stern look of
          anger, amounting to sullenness, on her well-formed
          features, and her pretty foot was beating the carpet
          in passionate impatience. It was Lady Levison.</p>
  <p>The doings of the past had been coming home to her for
          some time now: past doings, be they good, or be they
          ill, are sure to come home, one day or another, and
          to bring their fruits with them. If you sow wheat,
          it will come up wheat, gladdening you with its good:
          if you sow noxious weeds, noxious weeds spring
          forth, and you must do battle with them as you best
          can. It is the inevitable law of nature, and none
          can flee from it.</p>
  <p>In the years past, many years past now, Francis Levison
          had lost his heart—or whatever the thing might be
          that, with him, did duty for one—to Blanche
          Challoner. He had despised her once to Lady
          Isabel—but that was done to suit his own purpose,
            <pb n="37"/> for he had never, at any period,
          cared for Lady Isabel as he had cared for Blanche.
          He gained her affections in secret, and in secret
          they engaged themselves to each other. Blanche's
          sister, Lydia Challoner, two years older than
          herself, suspected it, and taxed Blanche with it.
          Blanche, true to her compact of keeping it a secret,
          denied it with many protestations. " <hi>She</hi>
          did not care for Captain Levison: rather disliked
          him, in fact." "So much the better," was Miss
          Challoner's reply: for she had no respect for
          Captain Levison, and deemed him an unlikely man to
          marry.</p>
  <p>Years went on, and poor, unhappy Blanche Challoner
          remained faithful to her love. In spite of what he
          was—and she could not blind her eyes to the fact
          that he was just the opposite of what he ought to be
          —her heart was true to him. She heard of his
          scrapes, she knew of his embarrassments, she bore
          with his neglect: but she loved on. Even the
          escapade with Lady Isabel Carlyle did not serve to
          extinguish her attachment, though it shook it for a
          time. Upon his return to London, after his accession
          to the title, their friendship was renewed: a cold,
          hollow, watery sort of friendship it had grown then
          on the gentleman's side, but Blanche never doubted
          that he would now marry her, impediments being
          removed.</p>
  <p>He played fast and loose with her: professing attachment
          for her in secret, and visiting at the house:
          perhaps he feared an outbreak from her, an exposure
          that might be anything but pleasant, did he throw
          off all relations between them. Blanche summoned up
          her courage, and spoke to him, urging the marriage:
          she <pb n="38"/> had not yet glanced at the fear
          that his intention of marrying her (had he ever
          possessed such) was over. Bad men are always
          cowards. Sir Francis shrank from an explanation;
          and, so far forgot honour, as to murmur some
          indistinct promise that the wedding should be
          speedy.</p>
  <p>Lydia Challoner had married, and been left a well
          jointured widow. She was Mrs. Waring: and at her
          house resided Blanche; for the girls were orphans.
          Blanche was beginning to show symptoms of her nearly
          thirty years: not the years, but the long-continued
          disappointment, the heart-burnings, were telling
          upon her. Her hair was thin, her face was pinched,
          her form had lost its roundness. "Marry <hi>her</hi>
          , indeed!" scoffed Sir Francis Levison to
          himself.</p>
  <p>There came to Mrs. Waring's, upon a Christmas visit, a
          younger sister, Alice Challoner, a fair girl of
          twenty years. She resided generally with an aunt in
          the country. Far more beautiful, was she, than
          Blanche had ever been: and Francis Levison, who had
          not seen her since she was a child, fell—as he would
          have called it— in love with her. Love! He became
          her shadow; he whispered sweet words in her ear; he
          turned her head giddy with its own vanity; and he
          offered her marriage. She accepted him, and
          preparations for the ceremony immediately began. Sir
          Francis urged speed, and Alice was nothing loth.</p>
  <p>And what of Blanche? Blanche was stunned. A despairing
          stupor took possession of her; and, when she awoke
          from it, desperation set in. She insisted upon an
          interview with Sir Francis; and evade it he could
          not, though he tried hard.</p>
  <pb n="39"/>
  <p>Will it be believed that he denied the past?—that he met
          with mocking suavity her indignant reminders of what
          had been between them? "Love? marriage? Nonsense!
          her fancy had been too much at work." Finally, he
          defied her to prove that he had regarded her with
          more than ordinary friendship, or had ever hinted at
          such a thing as a union.</p>
  <p>She could not prove it. She had not so much as a scrap of
          paper, written on by him; she had not a single
          friend, or enemy, to come forward and testify that
          they had heard him breathe to her a word of love. He
          had been too wary for that. Moreover, there were her
          own solemn protestations to her sister Lydia that
          there <hi>was not</hi> anything between her and
          Francis Levison: who would believe her if she veered
          round now, and avowed those protestations were
          false? No: she found that she was in a sinking ship,
          one there was no chance of saving.</p>
  <p>But one chance she determined to try. An appeal to Alice.
          Blanche Challoner's eyes were suddenly and rudely
          opened to the badness of the man, and she was aware
          now how thoroughly unfit he was to become the
          husband of her sister. It struck her that only
          misery could result from the union, and that, if
          possible, Alice should be saved from entering upon
          it. Would she have married him herself then? Yes.
          But it was a different thing for that fair, fresh
          young Alice: <hi>she</hi> had not wasted her life's
          best years in waiting for him.</p>
  <p>When the family had gone to rest and the house was quiet,
          Blanche Challoner proceeded to her sister's bedroom.
          Alice had not begun to undress: she was <pb n="40"/>
          sitting in a comfortable chair before the fire, her
          feet on the fender, reading a love-letter from Sir
          Francis.</p>
  <p>"Alice, I am come to tell you a story," said she,
          quietly. "Will you hear it?"</p>
  <p>"In a minute. Stop a bit," replied Alice. She finished
          the perusal of the letter, put it aside, and then
          spoke again. "What did you say, Blanche? A
          story?"</p>
  <p>Blanche nodded. "Several years ago, there was a fair
          young girl, none too rich, in our station of life. A
          gentleman, who was none too rich either, sought and
          gained her love. He could not marry: he was not
          rich, I say. They loved on in secret, hoping for
          better times, she wearing out her years and her
          heart. Oh, Alice, I cannot describe to you how she
          loved him; how she has continued to love him up to
          this moment! Through evil report she clung to him,
          tenaciously and tenderly as the vine clings to its
          trellis, for the world spoke ill of him."</p>
  <p>"Who was the young lady?" interrupted Alice. "Is this a
          fable of romance, Blanche, or a real history?"</p>
  <p>"A real history. I knew her. All those years; years and
          years, I say; he kept leading her on to love,
          letting her think that his love was hers. In the
          course of time, he succeeded to a fortune, and the
          bar to their marriage was over. He was abroad when
          he came into it, but returned home at once; their
          intercourse was renewed, and her fading heart woke
          up once more to life. Still, the marriage did not
          seem to come on; he said nothing of it; and she
          spoke to him. Very soon, <pb n="41"/> now should it
          be, was his answer, and she continued to live on—in
          hope."</p>
  <p>"Go on, Blanche," cried Alice, who had grown interested
          in the tale, never suspecting it could bear a
          personal interest.</p>
  <p>"Yes, I will go on. Would you believe, Alice, that almost
          immediately after this last promise, he saw one whom
          he fancied he should like better, and asked her to
          be his wife, forsaking the one to whom he was bound
          by every tie of honour; repudiating all that had
          been between them, even his own words and
          promises?"</p>
  <p>"How disgraceful! Were they married?"</p>
  <p>"They are to be. Would you have such a man?"</p>
  <p>"I!" returned Alice, quite indignant at the question. "It
          is not likely that I would."</p>
  <p>"That man, Alice, is Sir Francis Levison."</p>
  <p>Alice Challoner gave a start, and her face became
          scarlet. "How dare you say so, Blanche? It is not
          true. Who was the girl, pray? She must have traduced
          him."</p>
  <p>"She has not traduced him," was the subdued answer. "The
          girl was myself."</p>
  <p>An awkward pause. "I know!" cried Alice, throwing back
          her head resentfully. "He told me I might expect
          something of this: that you had fancied him in love
          with you, and were angry because he had chosen
          me."</p>
  <p>Blanche turned upon her with streaming eyes: she could no
          longer control her emotion. "Alice, my sister, all
          the pride is gone out of me; all the reticence that
          woman loves to observe as to her wrongs and her <pb n="42"/> inward feelings, I have broken through
          for you this night. As sure as that there is a
          heaven above us, I have told you but the truth.
          Until you came, I was engaged to Francis
          Levison."</p>
  <p>An unnatural scene ensued. Blanche, provoked at Alice's
          rejection of her words, told all the ill she knew,
          or had heard, of the man; she dwelt upon his conduct
          with regard to Lady Isabel Carlyle, his heartless
          after-treatment of that unhappy lady. Alice was
          passionate and fiery. She professed not to believe a
          word of her sister's wrongs, and, as to the other
          stories, they were no affairs of hers, she said:
          what had she to do with his past life?</p>
  <p>But Alice Challoner did believe: her sister's earnestness
          and distress, as she told the tale, carried
          conviction with them. She did not care very much for
          Sir Francis; he was not entwined round her heart, as
          he was round that of Blanche: but she was dazzled
          with the prospect of so good a settlement in life,
          and she would not give him up. If Blanche broke her
          heart—why, she must break it. But she need not have
          mixed taunts and jeers with her refusal to believe;
          she need not have <hi>triumphed</hi> openly over
          Blanche. Was it well done? As we sow, so, I tell
          you, we shall reap. She married Sir Francis Levison,
          leaving Blanche to her broken heart, or to any other
          calamity that might grow out of the injustice. And
          there sat Lady Levison now, her three years of
          marriage having served to turn her love for Sir
          Francis into contempt and hate.</p>
  <p>A little boy, two years old, the only child of the
          marriage, was playing about the room. His mother
          took no notice of him; she was buried in
          all-absorbing <pb n="43"/> thought; thought which
          caused her lips to contract and her brow to scowl.
          Sir Francis entered, his attitude lounging, his air
          listless. Lady Levison roused herself, but no
          pleasant manner or tone was hers, as she addressed
          him.</p>
  <p>"I want some money," she said.</p>
  <p>"So do I," he answered.</p>
  <p>An impatient stamp of the foot, and a haughty toss. "And
          I must have it. I <hi>must</hi> . I told you
          yesterday that I must. Do you suppose I can go on,
          without a sixpence of ready money, day after
          day?"</p>
  <p>"Do you suppose it is of any use to put yourself in this
          fury?" retorted Sir Francis. "A dozen times a week
          do you bother me for money, and a dozen times do I
          tell you I have got none. I have got none for
          myself. You may as well ask that baby for money, as
          ask me."</p>
  <p>"I wish he had never been born!" passionately said Lady
          Levison. "Unless he had had a different father."</p>
  <p>That the last sentence, and the bitter scorn of its tone,
          would have provoked a reprisal from Sir Francis, his
          flashing countenance betrayed. But at that moment a
          servant entered the room.</p>
  <p>"I beg your pardon sir. That man, Brown, forced his way
          into the hall, and—"</p>
  <p>"I can't see him, I won't see him," interrupted Sir
          Francis, backing to the farthest corner of the room,
          in what looked very like abject terror, as if he had
          completely lost his presence of mind. Lady Levison's
          lips curled.</p>
  <p>"We got rid of him, sir, after a dreadful deal of
          trouble, but while the door was open in the dispute,
            <pb n="44"/> Mr. Meredith entered. He has gone on
          into the library, sir, and he vows he won't stir
          till he sees you, whether you are sick or well."</p>
  <p>A moment's pause, a half-muttered oath, and then Sir
          Francis quitted the room. The servant retired, and
          Lady Levison caught up her child.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Franky dear," she wailed forth, burying her face in
          his warm neck, "I would leave him for good and all,
          if I dared: but I fear he might keep you."</p>
  <p>Now, the secret was, that for the last three days Sir
          Francis Levison had been desperately ill, obliged to
          keep his bed, and could see nobody; his life
          depending upon quiet. Such was the report, or
          something equivalent to it, which had gone in to
          Lord Headthelot (or, rather, to the official office,
          for that renowned chief was, himself, out of town);
          it had also been delivered to all callers at Sir
          Francis Levison's house. The real truth being, that
          Sir Francis was as well in health as you or I, but
          from something which had transpired, touching one of
          his numerous debts, did not dare to show. That
          morning the matter had been arranged; patched up for
          a time.</p>
  <p>"My stars, Levison!" began Mr. Meredith, who was a
          whipper-in of the ministry, "what a row there is
          about you! Why, you look as well as ever you
          were!"</p>
  <p>"A great deal better to-day," coughed Sir Francis.</p>
  <p>"To think that you should have chosen the present moment
          for skulking! Here have I been, dancing attendance
          at your door, day after day, in a state of incipient
          fever, enough to put me into a real one, and could
          neither get admitted nor a letter taken up. I should
            <pb n="45"/> have blown the house up to-day and
          got in amidst the flying débris. By the way, are you
          and my lady <hi>two</hi> , just now?"</p>
  <p>"Two?" growled Sir Francis.</p>
  <p>"She was stepping into her carriage yesterday when they
          turned me from the door, and I made inquiry of her.
          Her ladyship's answer was, that she knew nothing
          either of Sir Francis, or his illness."</p>
  <p>"Her ladyship is subject to flights of temper," chafed
          Sir Francis. "What desperate need have you of me,
          just now? Headthelot's away, and there's nothing
          doing."</p>
  <p>"Nothing doing up here; a deal too much doing somewhere
          else. Attley's seat is in the market."</p>
  <p>"Well?"</p>
  <p>"And you ought to have been down there about it three or
          four days ago. Of course you must step into it."</p>
  <p>"Of course I shan't," returned Sir Francis. "To represent
          West Lynne will not suit me."</p>
  <p>"Not suit you! West Lynne! Why, of all places, it is the
          most suitable. It's close to your own property."</p>
  <p>"If you call ten miles close. I shall not put up for West
          Lynne, Meredith."</p>
  <p>"Headthelot came up this morning," said Mr. Meredith.</p>
  <p>The information somewhat aroused Sir Francis.
          "Headthelot! What brings him back?"</p>
  <p>"You. I tell you, Levison, there's a hot row. Headthelot
          expected you would be at West Lynne days past, and
          he has come up in an awful rage. Every <pb n="46"/>
          additional vote we can count in the House is worth
          its weight in gold: and you, as he says, are
          allowing West Lynne to slip through your fingers!
          You must start for it at once, Levison."</p>
  <p>"No."</p>
  <p>"Then you lose your post. Thornton goes in for West
          Lynne, and takes your place with Headthelot."</p>
  <p>"Did Headthelot send you here to say this?" asked Sir
          Francis.</p>
  <p>"He did. And he means it, mind; that's more. I never saw
          a man more thoroughly in earnest."</p>
  <p>Sir Francis mused. Had the alternative been given him, he
          would have preferred to represent a certain warm
          place underground, rather than West Lynne. But, to
          quit Headthelot, and the snug post he anticipated,
          would be ruin irretrievable: nothing short of
          outlawry, or the Queen's prison. It was awfully
          necessary to get his threatened person into
          parliament, and he began to turn over in his mind
          whether he <hi>could</hi> bring himself to make
          further acquaintance with West Lynne. "The thing
          must have blown over for good by this time," was the
          result of his cogitations, unconsciously speaking
          aloud.</p>
  <p>"I can understand your reluctance to appear at West
          Lynne," cried Mr. Meredith; "the scene, unless I
          mistake, of that notorious affair of yours. But
          private feelings must give way to public interests;
          and the best thing you can do is to <hi>start</hi> .
          Headthelot is angry enough, as it is. He says, had
          you been down at first, as you ought to have been,
          you would have slipped in without opposition: but
          now there will be a contest."</p>
  <pb n="47"/>
  <p>Sir Francis looked up sharply. "A contest? Who is going
          to stand the funds?"</p>
  <p>"Psha! As if we should let funds be any barrier! Have you
          heard who is in the field?"</p>
  <p>"No," was the apathetic answer.</p>
  <p>"Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Carlyle!" shouted Sir Francis. "Oh, by George! I can't
          stand against him."</p>
  <p>"Well, there's the alternative. If you can't, Thornton
          will."</p>
  <p>"I should run no chance. West Lynne would not elect me if
          he is a candidate. I'm not sure, indeed, that West
          Lynne would have me in any case."</p>
  <p>"Nonsense! you know our interest there. Government put in
          Attley, and it can put in you. Yes, or no,
          Levison."</p>
  <p>"Yes," replied Sir Francis.</p>
  <p>An hour's time, and Sir Francis Levison went forth. On
          his way to be conveyed to West Lynne? Not yet. He
          turned his steps to Scotland-yard. In considerably
          less than another hour, the following telegram,
          marked "Secret" went down from the head office to
          the superintendant of police at West Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Is Otway Bethel at West Lynne? If not, where is he? and
          when will he be returning to it?"</p>
  <p>It elicited a prompt answer.</p>
  <p>"Otway Bethel is not at West Lynne. Supposed to be in
          Norway. Movements uncertain."</p>
  <p>Lady Levison heard of the scheme that was in the wind.
          When Sir Francis went to tell her (as a matter of
          the merest courtesy) that he was about to go into
            <pb n="48"/> the country for some days, she turned
          upon him fiercely.</p>
  <p>"If you have any sense of shame in you, you would shoot
          yourself, rather than go where you are going, to do
          what you are about to do."</p>
  <p>That ill feeling had come to an extreme pitch between her
          and her husband, and that he had been long giving
          her ample cause of resentment, you may be sure:
          otherwise she could not so have spoken. He bent his
          dark looks upon her.</p>
  <p>"I know the errand you are bent upon. You are going forth
          to enter yourself in opposition to Mr. Carlyle. You
          must possess a front of brass, a recollection seared
          to shame, or you could not do it. Any one, but you,
          would sink into the earth with humiliation, at sight
          of a man so injured."</p>
  <p>"Hold your tongue," said Sir Francis.</p>
  <p>"I held it for months and months; held it because you
          were my husband; though I was nearly mad. I shall
          never hold it again. Night and morning one prayer
          goes up from me—that I may find a way of being
          legally separated from you. I <hi>will</hi> find
          it."</p>
  <p>"You had better have left me to Blanche," sneered Sir
          Francis. "The taking me was a dead robbery on her,
          you know. You knew it then."</p>
  <p>She sat, beating her foot on the carpet, really striving
          to calm down her irritability. "Allow me to
          recommend you to pause and consider, ere you enter
          upon this insult to Mr. Carlyle," she resumed.</p>
  <p>"What is Carlyle to you? You don't know him."</p>
  <p>I know him by reputation: know him to be a noble,
          honourable man, beloved by his friends, respected by
            <pb n="49"/> all. If ever two men presented a
          contrast, it is you and he. Ask your uncle's widow
          what the world thinks of Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Had another been my adversary, I should not have cared
          to stand the contest," maliciously returned Sir
          Francis. "The thought that it is he who is my
          opponent, spurs me on. I'll oppose and crush
          him."</p>
  <p>"Take care that you do not get crushed yourself,"
          retorted Alice Levison. "Luck does not
            <hi>always</hi> attend the bad."</p>
  <p>"I'll take my chance," sneered Sir Francis.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER VII. A MISHAP TO THE BLUE SPECTACLES.</head>
  <p><hi>Mr. Carlyle</hi> and Barbara were seated at
          breakfast, when, somewhat to their surprise, Mr.
          Dill was shown in. Following close upon <hi>his</hi>
          heels came Justice Hare; and close upon his heels
          came Squire Pinner; while, bringing up the rear, was
          Colonel Bethel. All the four had come up separately,
          not together, and all four were out of breath, as if
          it had been a race which should arrive soonest.</p>
  <p>Quite impossible was it for Mr. Carlyle at first to
          understand the news they brought. All were talking
          at once, in the utmost excitement; and the fury of
          Justice Hare, alone, was sufficient to produce
          temporary deafness. Mr. Carlyle caught a word of the
          case presently.</p>
  <p>"A second man? Opposition? Well, let him come on," he
          good humouredly cried. "We shall have the
          satisfaction of ascertaining who wins in the
          end."</p>
  <p>"But you have not heard who it is, Mr. Archibald," cried
          old Dill. "It—"</p>
  <p>"Stand a contest with <hi>him!</hi> " raved Justice Hare.
          "He—"</p>
  <pb n="51"/>
  <p>"The fellow wants hanging," interjected Colonel
          Bethel.</p>
  <p>"Couldn't he be ducked?" suggested Squire Pinner.</p>
  <p>Now all these sentences were ranted out together, and
          their respective utterers were fain to stop till the
          noise subsided a little. Barbara could only look
          from one to the other in astonishment.</p>
  <p>"Who is this formidable opponent?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Not one of them but had the delicacy
          to shrink from naming that man to Mr. Carlyle. The
          information came at last from old Dill, who dropped
          his voice while he spoke it.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Archibald, the candidate, who has come forward, is
          that man, Levison."</p>
  <p>A scarlet flush dyed the brow of Mr. Carlyle. Barbara
          bent down her face, but her eyes flashed with
          anger.</p>
  <p>"Benjamin went through the town early this morning,
          exercising his horses," stuttered Justice Hare. "He
          came back, telling me that the walls were placarded
          with 'Levison for ever!' 'Vote for Sir Francis
          Levison!' I nearly knocked him down. 'It's true,
          master,' says he, 'as I'm a living sinner. And some
          folks, I spoke to, told me that the came down last
          evening.' There was news for a respectable man to
          hear before breakfast!"</p>
  <p>"He got here by the last train," said Mr. Dill, "and has
          put up at the Buck's Head. The printers must have
          sat up all night to get the placards ready. He has
          got an agent, or something of the sort, with him,
            <pb n="52"/> and some other chap, said to be a
          member of the government."</p>
  <p>"Boasting that the field is theirs at the onset, and that
          the canvass will be a matter of mere form!" added
          Colonel Bethel, bringing down his cane violently.
          "He is mad to offer himself as a candidate
          here."</p>
  <p>"It's done purposely to insult Mr. Carlyle," said the
          meek voice of Squire Pinner.</p>
  <p>"To insult us all, you mean, squire," retorted Colonel
          Bethel. "I don't think he will go off quite so
          glibly as he has come."</p>
  <p>"Of course, Carlyle, you'll go into it now, neck and
          crop," cried Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was silent.</p>
  <p>"You won't let the beast frighten you from the contest!"
          uttered Colonel Bethel, in a loud tone.</p>
  <p>"There's a meeting at the Buck's Head at ten," said Mr.
          Carlyle, not replying to the immediate question. "I
          will be with you there."</p>
  <p>"Did you say he is at the Buck's Head?" asked Squire
          Pinner. "I had not heard that."</p>
  <p>"That he was," corrected Mr. Dill. "I expect he is ousted
          by this time. I asked the landlord what he thought
          of himself, for taking in such a character, and what
          he supposed the justices would say to him. He vowed
          with tears in his eyes that the fellow should not be
          there another hour, and that he never should have
          entered the house had he known who he was."</p>
  <p>A little more conversation, and the visitors filed off.
          Mr. Carlyle sat down calmly to finish his breakfast.
          Barbara approached him.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, you will not suffer this man's insolent <pb n="53"/> doings to deter you from your plans? you
          will not withdraw?" she whispered.</p>
  <p>"I think not, Barbara. He has thrust himself offensively
          upon me in this measure: I believe my better plan
          will be to take no more heed of him, than I should
          of the dirt under my feet."</p>
  <p>"Right, right," she answered, a proud flush deepening the
          rose on her cheeks.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was soon walking into West Lynne. There were
          the placards, sure enough, side by side with his
          own. Bearing the name of that wicked coward, who had
          done him the greatest injury one man can do another.
          Verily he must possess a face of brass to venture
          there; as his wife had said, and Mr. Carlyle was
          thinking.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, have you heard the disgraceful news?"</p>
  <p>The speaker was Miss Carlyle, who had come down upon her
          brother like a ship with all its sails set. Her
          cheeks wore a flush, her eyes glistened, her tall
          form was drawn up to its most haughty height.</p>
  <p>"I have heard it, Cornelia. And, had I not, the walls
          would have enlightened me."</p>
  <p>"Is he out of his mind?"</p>
  <p>"Out of his reckoning, I fancy," replied Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"You will carry on the contest now," she continued, her
          countenance flashing. "I was averse to it before,
          but I now withdraw all my objection: you will be no
          brother of mine, if you yield the field to him."</p>
  <p>"I do not intend to yield it."</p>
  <p>"Good. You bear on, upon your course; and let him crawl
          on, upon his. Take no more heed of him <pb n="54"/>
          than if he were a viper. Archibald, you must canvass
          now."</p>
  <p>"No," said Mr. Carlyle, "I shall be elected without
          canvass. You'll see, Cornelia."</p>
  <p>"There will be plenty canvassing for you, if you don't
          condescend to take the trouble, my indifferent
          brother. I will give a thousand pounds myself for
          ale, to the electors."</p>
  <p>"Take care," laughed Mr. Carlyle. "Keep your thousand
          pounds in your pocket, Cornelia. <hi>I</hi> have no
          mind to be unseated, on the plea of 'bribery and
          corruption.' Here's Sir John Dobede galloping in,
          with a face as red as the sun in a fog."</p>
  <p>"Well it may be. He has heard the news. I can tell you,
          Archibald, West Lynne is in a state of excitement,
          that has not been its lot for many a day."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle was right. Excitement and indignation had
          taken possession of West Lynne. How the people
          rallied round Mr. Carlyle! Town and country were
          alike up in arms. But, government interest was rife
          at West Lynne, and, whatever the private and public
          feeling might be, collectively or individually, many
          votes would be recorded for Sir Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>Barbara had accompanied her husband that morning to the
          park gates. In returning, she met Madame Vine and
          the two children. William seemed quite well: he
          always did in a morning.</p>
  <p>"Mamma," exclaimed Lucy, "how warm you look! You have
          such a colour."</p>
  <p>"I am angry," replied Barbara; smiling at her own
          answer.</p>
  <p>"Why are you angry?"</p>
  <pb n="55"/>
  <p>"Because a man has come forward to oppose your papa. A
          second candidate."</p>
  <p>"Has he not a right?" asked William. "Papa said the field
          was open."</p>
  <p>"Open to all the world, but to him who has dared to enter
          it," replied Barbara, her indignation getting ahead
          of her discretion. "He is a base, contemptible man,
          one whom all good people scorn and shun. And he has
          had the face to thrust himself here in opposition to
          your papa!"</p>
  <p>"What is his name, mamma?"</p>
  <p>Barbara recollected herself then. But, if the children
          did not hear the name from her, they soon would,
          from other quarters.</p>
  <p>"It is Sir Francis Levison."</p>
  <p>Was it a sound of pain, or of terror, or of surprise,
          that burst from the governess? It sounded like a
          combination of all. Barbara turned to her: but she
          was leaning down her head then, coughing, her
          handkerchief to her face, which had changed to a
          deadly pallor.</p>
  <p>"Are you in pain?" gently demanded Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Pain! Oh no, thank you. Some—some dust must have got
          into my mouth, and caused the cough."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carlyle said no more. But she wondered: for the
          words shook as she spoke them, almost as much as did
          her ashy lips.</p>
  <p>"Can she know Francis Levison?" thought Barbara. "Was it
          the mention of his name that has so agitated
          her?"</p>
  <p>Strangely absent was Madame Vine at the lessons that
          day.</p>
  <pb n="56"/>
  <p>One of the first to become cognisant of the affair was
          Lord Mount Severn. He was at his club one evening in
          London, poring over an evening paper, when the names
          "Carlyle" "West Lynne" caught his view. Knowing that
          Mr. Carlyle had been named as the probable member,
          and heartily wishing the might become such, the earl
          naturally read the paragraph.</p>
  <p>He read it, and read it again; he rubbed his eyes, he
          rubbed his glasses: he pinched himself to see
          whether he were awake or dreaming. For, believe what
          that newspaper asserted—that Sir Francis Levison had
          entered the lists in opposition to Mr. Carlyle, and
          was at West Lynne, busily canvassing—he could
          not.</p>
  <p>"Do you know anything of this infamous assertion?" he
          inquired of an intimate friend—"infamous, whether it
          be true or false."</p>
  <p>"It is true. I heard of it an hour age. Plenty of cheek,
          that Levison must have."</p>
  <p>" <hi>Cheek!</hi> " repeated the dismayed earl, feeling
          as if every part of him, body and mind, were
          outraged by the news, "don't speak of it in that
          way. The hound deserves to be gibbeted."</p>
  <p>He threw aside the paper, quitted the club, returned home
          for a carpet-bag, and went shrieking and whistling
          down to West Lynne, taking his son with him. Or, if
          he did not whistle and shriek, the engine did. Fully
          determined was the Earl of Mount Severn to show
            <hi>his</hi> opinion of the affair.</p>
  <p>On these fine spring mornings, their breakfast over, Lady
          Isabel was in the habit of going into the grounds
          with the children. They were on the lawn before the
          house, when two gentlemen came walking up the <pb n="57"/> avenue; or, rather, one gentleman, and a
          handsome young stripling growing into another. Lady
          Isabel thought she should have dropped, for she
          stood face to face with Lord Mount Severn. The earl
          stopped to salute the children; and he raised his
          hat to the strange lady.</p>
  <p>"It is my governess, Madame Vine," said Lucy.</p>
  <p>A silent curtsey from Madame Vine. She turned away her
          head and gasped for breath.</p>
  <p>"Is your papa at home, Lucy?" cried the earl.</p>
  <p>"Yes. I think he is at breakfast. I'm so glad you are
          come!"</p>
  <p>Lord Mount Severn walked on, holding William by the hand,
          who had eagerly offered to "take him" to papa. Lord
          Vane bent over Lucy to kiss her. A little while, a
          very few more years, and my young lady would not
          hold up her rosy lips so boldly.</p>
  <p>"You have grown a dearer girl than ever, Lucy. Have you
          forgotten our compact?"</p>
  <p>"No," laughed she.</p>
  <p>"And you will not forget it?"</p>
  <p>"Never," said the child, shaking her head. "You shall see
          if I do."</p>
  <p>"Lucy is to be my wife," cried he, turning to Madame
          Vine. "It is a bargain, and we have both promised. I
          mean to wait for her till she is old enough. I like
          her better than anybody else in the world."</p>
  <p>"And I like him," said Miss Lucy. "And it's all
          true."</p>
  <p>Lucy was a child; it may almost be said an infant; and
          the viscount was not of an age to render such avowed
          previsions important: nevertheless the words
          thrilled <pb n="58"/> through the veins of the
          hearer. She spoke, she thought, not as Madame Vine
          would have spoken and thought, but as the unhappy
          mother, the ill-fated Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"You must not say these things to Lucy. It could never
          be."</p>
  <p>Lord Vane laughed. "Why?" asked he.</p>
  <p>"Your father and mother would not approve."</p>
  <p>"My father would. I know he would. He likes Lucy. As to
          my mother—oh, well, she can't expect to be master
          and mistress too. You be off for a minute, Lucy: I
          want to say something to Madame Vine. Has Carlyle
          shot that fellow?" he continued, as Lucy sprang
          away. "My father is so stiff, especially when he's
          put up, that he would not sully his lips with the
          name, when we arrived, or make a single inquiry,
          neither would he let me, and I walked up here with
          my tongue burning."</p>
  <p>She would have responded, What fellow? but she suspected
          too well, and the words died away on her unwilling
          lips.</p>
  <p>"That brute, Levison. If Carlyle riddled his body with
          shots, for this move, and then kicked him till he
          died, he'd only get his deserts; and the world would
          applaud. <hi>He</hi> oppose Carlyle! I wish I had
          been a man a few years ago: he'd have got a shot
          through his heart then. I say," dropping his voice,
          "did you know Lady Isabel?"</p>
  <p>"Yes—no—yes." She was at a loss what to say: almost as
          unconscious what she did say.</p>
  <p>"She was Lucy's mother, you know: and I loved her. I
          think that's why I love Lucy, for she is the <pb n="59"/> very image of her. Where did you know
          her? Here?"</p>
  <p>"I knew her by hearsay," murmured Lady Isabel, arousing
          to recollection.</p>
  <p>"O—hearsay! <hi>Has</hi> Carlyle shot the beast, or is he
          on his legs yet? By Jove! to think that he should
          sneak himself up, in this way, at West Lynne!"</p>
  <p>"You must apply elsewhere for information," she gasped.
          "I know nothing of these things."</p>
  <p>She turned away with a beating heart, took Lucy's hand
          and departed. Lord Vane set off on a run towards the
          house, his heels flying behind him.</p>
  <p>And now the contest began in earnest—that is, the
          canvass. Sir Francis Levison, his agent, and the
          friend from town, who, as it turned out, instead of
          being some great gun of the government, was a
          private chum of the baronet's, by name Drake,
          sneaked about the town like dogs with their tails
          burnt, for they were entirely alive to the odour in
          which they were held: their only attendants being a
          few young gentlemen and ladies in rags, who commonly
          brought up the rear. The other party presented a
          stately crowd. County gentry, magistrates, Lord
          Mount Severn. Sometimes Mr. Carlyle would be with
          them, arm-in-arm with the latter. If the contesting
          groups came within view of each other, and were
          likely to meet, the brave Sir Francis would
          disappear down an entry; behind a hedge; anywhere:
          with all his "face of brass," he could not meet Mr.
          Carlyle and that condemning jury around him.</p>
  <p>One afternoon, it pleased Mrs. Carlyle to summon Lucy and
          the governess to accompany her into West Lynne. She
          was going shopping. Lady Isabel had a <pb n="60"/>
          dread and horror of appearing there, whilst that man
          was in the town, but she could not help herself.
          There was no pleading illness, for she was quite
          well; there must be no saying "I will not go," for
          she was only a dependent. They set off, and had
          walked as far as Mrs. Hare's gate, when Miss Carlyle
          turned out of it.</p>
  <p>"Your mamma is not well, Barbara."</p>
  <p>"Is she not!" cried Barbara, with quick concern. "I must
          go in and see her."</p>
  <p>"She has had one of those ridiculous dreams again,"
          pursued Miss Carlyle, ignoring the presence of the
          governess and Lucy. "I was sure of it by her very
          look when I got in; shivering and shaking, and
          glancing fearfully around, as if she feared a dozen
          spectres were about to burst out of the walls. So I
          taxed her with it, and she could make no denial.
          Richard is in some jeopardy, she protests; or will
          be. And there she is, shaking still, although I told
          her that people who put faith in dreams were only
          fit for a lunatic asylum."</p>
  <p>Barbara looked distressed. She did not believe in dreams,
          any more than did Miss Carlyle; but she could not
          forget how strangely peril to Richard <hi>had</hi>
          supervened upon some of these dreams. "I will go in
          now and see mamma," she said. "If you are returning
          home, Cornelia, Madame Vine can walk with you, and
          wait for me there."</p>
  <p>"Let me go in with you, mamma," pleaded Lucy.</p>
  <p>Barbara mechanically took the child's hand. The gate
          closed on them, and Miss Carlyle and Lady Isabel
          proceeded in the direction of the town. But, not far
          had they gone when, in turning a corner, the wind,
          which was high, flew away with the veil of Lady
          Isabel; <pb n="61"/> and, in raising her hands in
          trepidation to save it, before it was finally gone,
          she contrived to knock off her blue spectacles. They
          fell to the ground, and were broken.</p>
  <p>"However did you manage that?" uttered Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>How indeed? She bent her face on the ground, looking at
          the damage. What should she do? The veil was over
          the hedge, the spectacles were broken: how could she
          dare to show her unshaded face? That face was rosy
          just then, as in former days, the eyes were bright,
          and Miss Carlyle caught their expression, and stared
          in very amazement.</p>
  <p>"Good Heavens above!" she muttered, "what an
          extraordinary likeness!" and Lady Isabel's heart
          turned faint and sick within her.</p>
  <p>Well it might. And, to make matters worse, bearing down
          right upon them, but a few paces distant, came Sir
          Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>Would <hi>he</hi> recognise her?</p>
  <pb n="62"/>

  <head>CHAPTER VIII. A TREAT IN A GREEN POND.</head>
  <p><hi>Standing</hi> in the high wind at the turning of the
          road, were Miss Carlyle and Lady Isabel Vane. The
          latter, confused and perplexed, was picking up the
          remnant of her damaged spectacles: the former,
          little less perplexed, gazed at the face, which
          struck her as being so familiar. Her attention,
          however, was called off to the apparition of Sir
          Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>He was close upon them, Mr. Drake and the other comrade
          being with him, and some tag-rag in attendance, as
          usual. It was the first time he and Miss Carlyle had
          met, face to face. She bent her condemning brow,
          haughty in its bitter scorn, full upon him. Sir
          Francis, when he arrived opposite, raised his hat to
          her. Whether it was done in courtesy, in confused
          unconsciousness, or in mockery, cannot be told: Miss
          Carlyle assumed it to have been the latter; and her
          lips, in their anger, grew almost as pale as those
          of the unhappy woman who was cowering behind
          her.</p>
  <p>"Did you intend that insult for me, Francis Levison?"</p>
  <p>"As you please to take it," returned he, calling up
          insolence to his aid.</p>
  <pb n="63"/>
  <p>" <hi>You</hi> dare to lift off your hat to me? Have you
          forgotten that I am Miss Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"It would be difficult for <hi>you</hi> to be forgotten,
          once seen."</p>
  <p>Now this answer <hi>was</hi> given in mockery; and his
          tone and manner were most insolent. The two
          gentlemen looked on in discomfort, wondering what it
          meant; Lady Isabel hid her face as she best could,
          terrified to death lest his eyes should fall upon
          her; while the spectators who had collected listened
          with interest, especially some farm labourers of
          Squire Pinner's.</p>
  <p>"You contemptible worm!" ejaculated Miss Carlyle. "Do you
          think you can outrage me with impunity, as you are
          outraging West Lynne? Out upon you, for a bold, bad
          man!"</p>
  <p>Now Miss Corny, in so speaking, had certainly no thought
          of present and immediate punishment for the
          gentleman: but it appeared that the mob around had.
          The motion was commenced by those stout-shouldered
          labourers. Whether excited thereto by the words of
          Miss Carlyle—who, whatever may have been her faults
          of manner, had the respect of the neighbourhood, and
          was looked up to only in a less degree than her
          brother; whether Squire Pinner, their master, had
          let drop in their hearing a word of the ducking he
          had hinted at, when at East Lynne; or whether their
          own feelings alone spurred them on, was best known
          to the men themselves. Certain it is, that the
          ominous sound of "Duck him," was breathed forth by a
          voice, and it was caught up and echoed around.</p>
  <p>"Duck him! Duck him! The pond he close at hand. Let's
          give him a taste of his deservings! What <pb n="64"/> do he, the scum, turn himself up at West Lynne
          for, bearding Mr. Carlyle? What have he done with
          Lady Isabel? <hi>Him</hi> put up for us others at
          West Lynne! West Lynne don't want him: it have got a
          better man: it won't have a villain. Now, lads!"</p>
  <p>His face turned white, and he trembled in his shoes:
          worthless men are frequently cowards. Lady Isabel
          trembled in hers: and, well she might, hearing that
          one allusion. They set upon him, twenty pairs of
          hands at least, strong, rough, determined hands; not
          to speak of the tag-rag's help, who went in with
          cuffs and kicks, and pokes, and taunts, and cheers,
          and a demoniac dance.</p>
  <p>They dragged him through a gap in the hedge, a gap that
          no baby could have got through in a cool moment, but
          we most of us know the difference between coolness
          and excitement. The hedge was extensively damaged,
          but Justice Hare, to whom it belonged, would forgive
          that. Mr. Drake and the lawyer —for the other was a
          lawyer—were utterly powerless to stop the
          catastrophe. "If they didn't mind their own business
          and keep theirselves clear, they'd get served the
          same," was the promise held out in reply to their
          remonstrances; and the lawyer, who was short and
          fat, and could not have knocked a man down, had it
          been to save his life, backed out of the mêlée, and
          contented himself with issuing forth confused
          threatenings of the terrors of the law. Miss Carlyle
          stood her ground majestically, and looked on with a
          grim countenance. Had she interfered for his
          protection, she could not have been heard, and it is
          by no means certain that she had any wish to
          interfere.</p>
  <pb n="65"/>
  <p>On, to the brink of the pond: a green, dank, dark, slimy,
          sour, stinking pond. His coat tails were gone by
          this time, and sundry rents and damages appeared
          in—in another useful garment. One pulled him,
          another pushed him, a third shook him by the collar,
          half a dozen buffeted him, and all abused him.</p>
  <p>"In with him, boys!"</p>
  <p>"Mercy! mercy!" shrieked the victim, his knees bending
          and his teeth chattering, "a little mercy, for the
          love of Heaven!"</p>
  <p>"Heaven! Much he knows of Heaven!"</p>
  <p>A souse, a splash, a wild cry, a gurgle, and Sir Francis
          Levison was floundering in the water, its green
          poison, not to mention its adders and toads and
          frogs, going down his throat by bucketsful. A
          hoarse, derisive laugh, and a hip, hip, hurrah!
          broke from the actors; while the juvenile tag-rag,
          in wild delight, joined hands around the pool, and
          danced the demon's dance, like so many red Indians.
          They had never had such a play acted for them
          before.</p>
  <p>Out of the pea-soup before he was quite dead, quite
          senseless. Of all drowned rats, he looked the worst,
          as he stood there with his white, rueful face, his
          shivery limbs, and his dilapidated garments, shaking
          the wet off him. The labourers, their duty done,
          walked coolly away; the tag-rag withdrew to a safe
          distance, waiting for what might come next; and Miss
          Carlyle moved away also. Not more shivery, was that
          wretched man, than Lady Isabel, as she walked by her
          side. A sorry figure to cut, that, for her once
          chosen cavalier. What did she think of his beauty
          now? I know what she thought of her past folly.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle did not speak a word. She sailed on, <pb n="66"/> with her head up, though it was turned
          occasionally to look at the face of Madame Vine, at
          the deep, distressing blush which this gaze called
          into her cheeks. "It's very odd," thought Miss
          Corny. "The likeness, especially in the eyes,
          is—Where are you going, madame?"</p>
  <p>They were passing a spectacle shop, and Madame Vine had
          halted at the door, one foot on its step. "I must
          leave my glasses to be mended, if you please."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle followed her in. She pointed out what she
          wanted done to the old glasses, and said she would
          buy a pair of new, to wear while the job was about.
          The man had no blue ones, no green; plenty of white.
          One ugly old pair of green things he had, with
          tortoiseshell rims, left by some stranger, ages and
          ages ago, to be mended, and never called for again.
          This very pair of ugly old green things was chosen
          by Lady Isabel. She put them on, there and then,
          Miss Carlyle's eyes searching her face inquisitively
          all the time.</p>
  <p>"Why do you wear glasses?" began Miss Corny, abruptly, as
          soon as they were within the doors of her own
          house.</p>
  <p>Another deep flush, and an imperceptible hesitation. "My
          eyes are not strong."</p>
  <p>"They look as strong as eyes can look. But, why wear
          coloured glasses? White ones would answer every
          purpose, I should suppose."</p>
  <p>"I am accustomed to coloured ones. I should not like
          white ones now."</p>
  <p>Miss Corny paused. "What is your Christian name, madame?"
          began she again.</p>
  <p>"Jane," replied madame, popping out an unflinching story,
          in her alarm.</p>
  <p>"Here! here! what's up? What's this?"</p>
  <pb n="67"/>
  <p>There was a crowd in the street, and rather a noisy one.
          Miss Corny flew to the window, Lady Isabel in her
          wake. Two crowds, it may almost be said; for, from
          the opposite way, the scarlet-and-purple party— as
          Mr. Carlyle's was called, in allusion to his
          colours— came in view. Quite a collection of
          gentlemen; Mr. Carlyle and Lord Mount Severn heading
          them.</p>
  <p>What could it mean, the mob they were encountering? The
          yellow party doubtless, but in a disreputable
          condition. Who or what <hi>was</hi> that object in
          advance of it, supported between Drake and the
          lawyer, and looking like a drowned rat? Hair
          hanging, legs tottering, cheeks shaking, and clothes
          in tatters! While the mob, behind, had swollen to
          the length of the street, and was keeping up a
          perpetual fire of derisive shouts, groans, and
          hisses. The scarlet-and-purples halted in
          consternation, and Lord Mount Severn, whose sight
          was not as good as it had been twenty years back,
          stuck his pendent eye-glasses astride on the bridge
          of his nose.</p>
  <p><hi>Sir Francis Levison?</hi> Could it be? Yes, it
          actually was! What on earth had put him into that
          state? Mr. Carlyle's lip curled: he continued his
          way, and drew the peer with him.</p>
  <p>"What the deuce is a gate now?" called out the followers
          of Mr. Carlyle. "That's Levison! Has he been in a
          railway smash, and got drenched by the engine?"</p>
  <p>"He have been <hi>ducked!</hi> " grinned the yellows, in
          answer. "They have been and ducked him in the rush
          pool, on Mr. Justice Hare's land. Go it, my pippin!
          keep up on your legs."</p>
  <p>The last sentence was pitched at the sufferer. "Who <pb n="68"/> did it?" asked the purples, striving to
          keep their countenances.</p>
  <p>"Squire Pinner's men led it on, they did. Hooray!"</p>
  <p>"Hooray!" echoed Squire Pinner himself, as he heard it,
          pushing forward to the front, with a great crimson
          and purple star in his coat, and totally forgetting
          his good manners. "That is glorious news. My
          labourers? I'll give 'em a crown a piece for drink
          to-night, dashed if I don't."</p>
  <p>The soaked and miserable man increased his speed as much
          as his cold and trembling legs would allow him; he
          would have borne on without legs at all, rather than
          remain under the enemy's gaze. The enemy loftily
          continued their way, their heads in the air, and
          scorning further notice; all save young Lord Vane.
          He hovered round the ranks of the unwashed, and
          looked vastly inclined to enter upon an Indian jig,
          on his own account. "What a thundering ass I was, to
          try it on at West Lynne!" was the enraged comment of
          the sufferer.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle laid her hand upon the shrinking arm of her
          pale companion. "You see him; my brother
          Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"I see him," faltered Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"And you see <hi>him</hi> , that pitiful outcast, who is
          too contemptible to live? Look at the two, and
          contrast them. Look well."</p>
  <p>"Yes?" was the gasping answer.</p>
  <p>"The woman who called that noble man, husband, quitted
          him for the other! Did she come to repentance, think
          you?"</p>
  <p>You may wonder that the submerged gentleman should be
            <hi>walking</hi> through the streets, on his way
          to <pb n="69"/> his quarters, the Raven Inn—for he
          had been ejected from the Buck's Head—but he could
          not help himself. As he was dripping and swearing on
          the brink of the pond, wondering how he should get
          to the Raven, an empty fly drove past, and Mr. Drake
          immediately stopped it. But when the driver saw the
          passenger was Sir Francis Levison, he refused the
          job. His fly was just fresh lined with red velvet,
          and he warn't a going to have it spoilt, he called
          out, as he whipped his horse, and drove away,
          leaving the three in wrathful despair. Sir Francis
          wanted another conveyance procured: his friends
          urged that if he waited for that, he might catch his
          death, and that the shortest way would be, to hasten
          to the inn on foot. He objected. But his jaws were
          chattering, his limbs were quaking, so they seized
          him between them, and made off. But they never
          bargained for the meeting with Mr. Carlyle and his
          party: Francis Levison would have stopped in the
          pond, of his own accord, head downwards, rather than
          face <hi>them.</hi></p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle went that day to dine at East Lynne, walking
          back with Mrs. Carlyle, Madame Vine, and Lucy. Lord
          Vane found them out and returned at the same time:
          of course East Lynne was the head-quarters of
          himself and father. He was in the seventh heaven,
          and had been, ever since the encounter with the
          yellows. "You'd have gone into the laughing
          convulsions, Lucy, had you seen the drowned cur. I'd
          give all my tin for six months to come, to have a
          photograph of him as he looked then!" Lucy laughed
          in glee: she was unconscious, poor child, how deeply
          the "drowned cur" had injured her.</p>
  <p>When Miss Carlyle was in her dressing-room taking <pb n="70"/> her things off—the room where once had
          slept Richard Hare—she rang for Joyce. Those two
          rooms were still kept for Miss Carlyle—for she
          sometimes visited them for a few days—they were
          called "Miss Carlyle's rooms."</p>
  <p>"A fine row we have had in the town, Joyce, this
          afternoon!"</p>
  <p>"I have heard of it, ma'am. Serve him right, if they had
          let him drown! Bill White, Squire Pinner's
          ploughman, called in here and told us the news. He'd
          have burst with it, if he hadn't, I expect: I never
          saw a chap so excited. Peter cried."</p>
  <p>"Cried!" echoed Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Well, ma'am, you know he was very fond of Lady Isabel,
          was Peter, and somehow his feelings overcame him. He
          said he had not heard anything to please him so much
          for many a day; and, with that, he burst out crying,
          and gave Bill White half-a-crown out of his pocket.
          Bill White said it was he who held one leg when they
          soused him in. Afy saw it—if you'll excuse my
          mentioning her name to you, ma'am, for I know you
          don't think well of her; and when she got in here
          she fell into hysterics."</p>
  <p>"How did she see it?" snapped Miss Carlyle, her
          equanimity upset by the sound of the name. "I didn't
          see her: and I was present."</p>
  <p>"She was coming here with a message from Mrs. Latimer to
          the governess: news that Mrs. Latimer had received
          from Germany, from some German count's young wife.
          Afy said she took the field way, and had just got to
          the stile, near the pond, when the uproar
          began."</p>
  <pb n="71"/>
  <p>"What did she go into hysterics for?" again snapped Miss
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It upset her so, she said," returned Joyce.</p>
  <p>"It wouldn't have done her harm, had they ducked her
          too," was the angry response.</p>
  <p>Joyce was silent. To contradict Miss Corny brought
          triumph to nobody. And she was conscious, in her
          inmost heart, that Afy merited a little wholesome
          correction; not perhaps to the extent of a
          ducking.</p>
  <p>"Joyce," resumed Miss Carlyle, abruptly changing the
          subject, "of whom does the governess put you in
          mind?"</p>
  <p>"Ma'am?" repeated Joyce, in some surprise, as it
          appeared. "The governess? Do you mean Madame
          Vine?"</p>
  <p>"Do I mean you? or do I mean me? are we governesses?"
          irascibly cried Miss Corny. "Who should I mean, but
          Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>She turned herself round from the looking-glass, and
          grazed full in Joyce's face, waiting for the answer.
          Joyce lowered her voice as she gave it.</p>
  <p>"There are times when she puts me in mind of my late
          lady, both in her face and manner. But I have never
          said so, ma'am: for you know Lady Isabel's name must
          be an interdicted one in this house."</p>
  <p>"Have you seen her without her glasses?"</p>
  <p>"No: never," said Joyce.</p>
  <p>"I did, to-day," returned Miss Carlyle. "And I can tell
          you, Joyce, that I was confounded at the likeness.
          It is an extraordinary likeness. One would think it
          was the ghost of Lady Isabel Vane, come into the
          world again."</p>
  <pb n="72"/>
  <p>"Oh, ma'am, please don't joke! it's not a topic for it,"
          cried Joyce, her tone an imploring one.</p>
  <p>"Joke? When do you know me to joke?" returned Miss
          Carlyle. But she said no more. "What is this that I
          hear, about William's being worse?" she resumed,
          after a pause.</p>
  <p>"I don't think he's much worse, ma'am. Weak and poorly he
          seems, there's no denying it, especially towards
          night-time: but I never will believe that he is
          going in a bad way; as some of them want to make
          out."</p>
  <p>"If I am to believe what I hear, he is in a bad way,"
          said Miss Corny.</p>
  <p>"Ma'am who told you?"</p>
  <p>"The governess; this afternoon. She spoke of it as being
          quite a case of despair—and her tone was as
          despairing as her words."</p>
  <p>"I know she thinks he is very ill. She has talked about
          him to me several times in the last few days."</p>
  <p>"I should not be surprised if he did drop off," concluded
          Miss Corny, with equanimity. "He is his mother again
          all over, so far as constitution goes: and I'm sure
          she never was good for much."</p>
  <p>That evening, after dinner, Miss Carlyle and Lord Mount
          Severn sat side by side on the same sofa, coffee
          cups in hand. Sir John Dobede and one or two more
          gentlemen were of the party. Young Vane, Lucy, and
          Mrs. Carlyle were laughing together; and there was
          considerable noise and talking in the room. Under
          cover of it, Miss Carlyle turned to the earl.</p>
  <p>"Was it a positively ascertained fact that Lady Isabel
          died."</p>
  <p>The earl stared with all his might: he thought it <pb n="73"/> the strangest question that ever was
          asked him. "I scarcely understand you, Miss Carlyle.
          Died? Certainly she died."</p>
  <p>"When the result of the accident was communicated to you,
          you made inquiry, yourself, into its truth, its
          details, I believe?"</p>
  <p>"It was my duty to do so. There was no one else to
          undertake it."</p>
  <p>"Did you ascertain positively, beyond all doubt, that she
          did die?"</p>
  <p>"Of a surety I did. She died in the course of the same
          night. She was terribly injured."</p>
  <p>A pause. Miss Carlyle was ruminating. But she returned to
          the charge, as if difficult to be convinced.</p>
  <p>"You deem that there could be no possibility of an error?
          You are sure that she is dead?"</p>
  <p>"I am as sure that she is dead, as that we are living,"
          decisively replied the earl; and he spoke but
          according to his belief. "Wherefore should you be
          inquiring this?"</p>
  <p>"A thought came over me—only to-day—to wonder whether she
          was really dead."</p>
  <p>"Had any error occurred at the time, any false report of
          her death, I should soon have found it out by her
          drawing the annuity I settled upon her. It has never
          been drawn since. Besides, she would have written to
          me, as was agreed upon. No, poor thing! she is gone,
          beyond all doubt, and has taken her sins with
          her."</p>
  <p>Convincing proofs. And Miss Carlyle lent her ear to
          them.</p>
  <p>The following morning, Lord Vane, Lucy, and William were
          running races on the lawn, the viscount having
          joined Madame Vine's breakfast-table, without <pb n="74"/> the ceremony of asking. William's racing,
          indeed, was more pretence than work, he and his
          breath were so soon tired; and Lord Vane gave Lucy
          "half," and beat her then, the forfeit, if she lost,
          being five kisses. Lucy told him one was enough, but
          he battled it out, and got five. Lady Isabel had
          made prisoner of Archibald, and was holding him on
          her knee in the grey parlour, clasped to her in the
          impassioned manner that few, save a mother, can
          clasp a child, when Mr. Carlyle entered.</p>
  <p>"Do you admit intruders here, Madame Vine?" cried he,
          with his sweet smile and his attractive manner.</p>
  <p>She let the boy slip to the ground, and rose; her face
          burning, her heart throbbing. Archie immediately ran
          off to his elders on the grass.</p>
  <p>"Keep your seat, pray," said Mr. Carlyle, taking one
          opposite to her, and admiring no doubt her
          tortoiseshell spectacles. "How does William seem?
          for that is what I have come to ask you."</p>
  <p>She laid her hand upon her bosom, striving to make it
          still; she essayed to control her voice to calmness.
          Alone, with him! "There was no difference," she
          murmured; and then she took courage, and spoke more
          openly.</p>
  <p>"I understood you to say the other night, sir, that he
          should have further advice."</p>
  <p>"Ay. I intended to take him over to Lynneborough, to Dr.
          Martin, and the drive would have done him good; but
          I have been so much engaged there has been no time
          to think of it. Neither do I know when I shall be at
          liberty."</p>
  <p>"Let me take him, sir," she cried, yearningly. "Indeed, I
          think no time should be lost. We could <pb n="75"/>
          go by train. What objection have you?" she quickly
          added. "Surely you can trust him with me!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle smiled. "I can trust him and you too," cried
          he, "and I think the plan would be a good one, if
          you do not mind the trouble."</p>
  <p>Mind the trouble! when her boy's life was at stake. "Let
          us go to-day, sir," she said, with feverish
          impatience.</p>
  <p>"I will ascertain whether Mrs. Carlyle wants the pony
          carriage," said he. "It will be better to go in that
          than boxed up in the railway train."</p>
  <p>Her heart rose rebelliously as he quitted the room. Were
          Mrs. Carlyle's capricious "wants" to be studied
          before her child's life? A moment's battle, and she
          clasped her hands meekly on her knee: was that the
          spirit in which she had promised to take up her
          daily cross? She had put the same question to
          herself many times lately.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle returned. "The pony carriage will be at your
          service, Madame Vine. John will drive you to the
          Royal, the hotel I use in Lynneborough, and Dr.
          Martin lives within a few doors of it. Order any
          refreshment you please at the hotel: it will be put
          down to my account. Perhaps you had better dine
          there: it may not be well for William to wait."</p>
  <p>"Very well, sir. Thank you. What time can we start?"</p>
  <p>"Any time you like. Ten o'clock? Will that suit?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, quite well, sir. Thank you very much."</p>
  <p>"Thank me for what?" laughed Mr. Carlyle: "for giving you
          a troublesome journey? Let me see—the <pb n="76"/>
          doctor's fee will be a guinea," he said, taking out
          his purse.</p>
  <p>"Oh, that is nothing," she hastily interrupted. "I will
          pay for him myself: I would rather."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle looked surprised. He said nothing; simply
          laid down the sovereign and shilling on the table.
          Madame Vine blushed vividly: how could she, the
          governess, so have forgetten herself?</p>
  <p>Poor, unhappy Lady Isabel! A recollection flashed over
          her of that morning, years ago, when Lord Mount
          Severn had handed out to her some gold, three
          sovereigns: and of the hundred-pound note so
          generously left in her hands afterwards by another.
            <hi>Then</hi> she was his chosen love: ay, she
          was; though it had not been declared. <hi>Now?</hi>
          —A pang, as of death, shot through her bitter
          heart.</p>
  <p>"You can remind Dr. Martin that the child's constitution
          is precisely what his mother's was," continued Mr.
          Carlyle, a tinge lighting his face. "It may be a
          guide to his treatment. He said, himself, it was,
          when he attended him for an illness a year or two
          ago."</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
  <p>He crossed the hall on his entrance to the breakfast
          room. She tore up-stairs to her chamber, and sank
          down in an agony of tears and despair. Oh! to love
          him as she did now! to yearn after his affection
          with this passionate, jealous longing, and to know
          that they were separated for ever and for ever; that
          she was worse to him than nothing!</p>
  <p>Softly, my lady! This is not bearing your cross.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER IX. APPEARANCE OF A RUSSIAN BEAR AT WEST
          LYNNE.</head>
  <p><hi>Mr. Carlyle</hi> harangued the populace from the
          balcony of the Buck's Head, a substantial old house,
          renowned in the days of posting, now past and gone.
          Its balcony was an old-fashioned, roomy balcony,
          painted green, where there was plenty of space for
          his friends to congregate. He was a persuasive
          orator, winning his way to ears and hearts: but, had
          he spoken with plums in his mouth, and a stammer on
          his tongue, and a break-down at every sentence, the
          uproarious applause and shouts would have been
          equally rife. Mr. Carlyle was intensely popular in
          West Lynne, setting aside the candidateship and his
          oratory; and West Lynne made common cause against
          Sir Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>Sir Francis Levison harangued the mob from the Raven, but
          in a more ignoble manner. For the Raven possessed no
          balcony, and he was fain to let himself down with a
          stride and a jump, from the first-floor window to
          the top of the bow-window of the parlour, and stand
          there. The Raven, though a comfortable, old
          established, and respectable inn, could boast only
          of casements for its upper windows, and they are not
          convenient to deliver speeches from. He was wont,
          therefore, to take his stand on the ledge of the
          bow-window, and that was <pb n="78"/> not altogether
          convenient either, for it was but narrow, and he
          hardly dared move an arm or a leg, for fear of
          pitching over, on to the upturned faces. Mr. Drake
          let himself down also, to support him on one side,
          and, the first day, the lawyer supported him on the
          other. For the first day only: for that worthy,
          being not so high as Sir Francis Levison's or Mr.
          Drake's shoulder, and about five times their
          breadth, had those two been rolled into one,
          experienced a slight difficulty in getting back
          again. It was accomplished at last, Sir Francis
          pulling him up, and Mr. Drake hoisting him from
          behind, just as a ladder was being brought out to
          the rescue, amidst shouts of laughter. The stout man
          wiped the perspiration from his face when he was
          landed in safety, and recorded a mental vow never to
          descend from a window again. After that, the
          candidate and his friend shared the shelf between
          them. The lawyer's name was Rubiny, ill-naturedly
          supposed to be a corruption of Reuben.</p>
  <p>They stood there one afternoon, the eloquence of Sir
          Francis in full play (but he was a shocking
          speaker), and the crowd, laughing, hissing,
          groaning, and applauding, blocking up the road. Sir
          Francis could not complain of one thing—that he got
          no audience. For it was the pleasure of West Lynne
          extensively to support him in that respect: a few to
          cheer, a great many to jeer and hiss. Remarkably
          dense was the mob on this afternoon, for Mr. Carlyle
          had just concluded his address from the Buck's head,
          and the crowd who had been listening to him, came
          rushing up to swell the ranks of the other crowd.
          They were elbowing and pushing and treading on each
          others' heels, when an open barouche drove suddenly
          up, to scatter them. <pb n="79"/> Its horses wore
          scarlet and purple rosettes; and one lady, a very
          pretty one, sat inside it. Mrs. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>But the crowd could not be so easily scattered: it was
          too thick: the carriage could advance but at a
          snail's pace, and now and then came to a
          stand-still. Sir Francis Levison's speech came to a
          stand-still also, till the confusion should subside.
          He did not bow to Barbara: he remembered the result
          of his having done so to Miss Carlyle: and the
          little interlude of the pond had washed most of his
          impudence out of him. He remained at his post, not
          looking at Barbara, not looking at anything in
          particular, but waiting till the interruption should
          have passed.</p>
  <p>Barbara, under cover of her dainty lace parasol, turned
          her eyes upon him. At that very moment he raised his
          right hand, slightly shook his head back, and tossed
          his hair off his brow. His hand, ungloved, was white
          and delicate as a lady's, and his rich diamond ring
          gleamed in the sun. The pink flush on Barbara's
          cheek deepened to a crimson damask, and her brow
          contracted as with a remembrance of pain.</p>
  <p>"The very action Richard described! the action he was
          always using at East Lynne! I believe from my heart
          that man is Thorn: Richard was labouring under some
          mistake, when he said he knew Sir Francis
          Levison."</p>
  <p>She let her hands fall upon her knee as she spoke,
          heedless of the candidate, heedless of the crowd,
          heedless of all, save her own troubled thoughts. A
          hundred respectful salutations were uttered, she
          answered them mechanically; a shout was raised,
          "Long live Carlyle! Carlyle for ever!" Barbara bowed
          her pretty head on either side, and the carriage at
          length got on.</p>
  <pb n="80"/>
  <p>The parting of the crowd brought Mr. Dill (who had come
          to listen for once to the speech of the second man)
          and Mr. Ebenezer James close to each other. Mr.
          Ebenezer James was one who for the last twelve or
          fifteen years had been trying his hand at many
          trades, and had not come out particularly well at
          any. A rolling stone gathers no moss. First, he had
          been clerk to Mr. Carlyle; next he had been seduced
          into joining the corps of the Theatre Royal at
          Lynneborough; then he turned auctioneer; then
          traveller in the oil and colour line; then a parson,
          the urgent pastor of some sect; then omnibus-driver;
          then collector of the water-rate; and now he was
          clerk again; not in Mr. Carlyle's office, but in
          that of Ball and Treadman, other solicitors of West
          Lynne. A good humoured, good natured idle chap was
          Mr. Ebenezer James, and that was the worst that
          could be urged against him, save that he was
          sometimes out at pocket and out at elbows. His
          father was a respectable man, had made money in
          trade; but he had married a second wife, had a
          second family, and his eldest son did not come in
          for much of the paternal money; though he did for a
          large share of the paternal anger.</p>
  <p>"Well, Ebenezer, and how goes the world with you?" cried
          Mr. Dill, by way of salutation.</p>
  <p>"Jogging on. It never gets to a trot."</p>
  <p>"Didn't I see you turning into your father's house
          yesterday?"</p>
  <p>"I pretty soon turned out of it again. I'm like the
          monkey when I venture there—get more kicks than
          halfpence. Hush, old gentleman! we interrupt the
          eloquence."</p>
  <p>Of course "the eloquence" applied to Sir Francis <pb n="81"/> Levison, and they set themselves to
          listen, Mr. Dill with a serious face, Mr. Ebenezer
          with a grinning one. But, soon, a jostle and
          movement carried them to the outside of the crowd,
          out of sight of the speaker, though not entirely out
          of hearing. By these means they had a view of the
          street, and discerned something advancing towards
          them, which they took for a Russian bear on its hind
          legs.</p>
  <p>"I'll—be—blest," uttered Mr. Ebenezer James, after a
          prolonged pause of staring consternation, "if I
          don't believe it's Bethel!"</p>
  <p>"Bethel!" repeated old Dill, gazing at the approaching
          figure. "What has he been doing to himself?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Otway Bethel it was, just arrived from foreign parts
          in his travelling costume. Something shaggy,
          terminating all over with tails. A shaggy cap
          surmounted his head, and the hair on his face would
          have set up Mr. Justice Hare in wigs for his life. A
          wild object he looked, and Mr. Dill rather backed as
          he drew near, as if fearing he were a real animal
          which might bite him.</p>
  <p>"What's your name?" cried he.</p>
  <p>"It used to be Bethel," replied the wild man, holding out
          his hand to Mr. Dill. "So you are in the world,
          James, and kicking yet!"</p>
  <p>"And hope to kick in it for some time to come," replied
          Mr. James. "Where did you hail from last? A
          settlement at the North Pole?"</p>
  <p>"Didn't get quite so far. What's the row here?"</p>
  <p>"When did you arrive, Mr. Otway?" inquired old Dill.</p>
  <p>"Now. Four o'clock train. I say, what's up?"</p>
  <pb n="82"/>
  <p>"An election; that's all," said Mr. Ebenezer. "Attley
          went and kicked the bucket."</p>
  <p>"I don't ask about the election; I heard all that at the
          railway station," returned Otway Bethel,
          impatiently. "What's <hi>this?</hi> " waving his
          hand at the crowd.</p>
  <p>"One of the candidates, wasting breath and words.
          Levison."</p>
  <p>"I say," repeated Otway Bethel, looking at Mr. Dill,
          "wasn't it rather—rather of the ratherest, for
            <hi>him</hi> to oppose Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"Infamous! contemptible!" was the old gentleman's excited
          answer. "But he'll get his deserts yet, Mr. Otway;
          they have already begun. He was treated to a ducking
          yesterday in Justice Hare's green pond."</p>
  <p>"And he did look a miserable devil when he came out,
          trailing through the streets," added Mr. Ebenezer,
          while Otway Bethel burst into a laugh. "He was
          smothered into some hot blankets at the Raven, and a
          pint of burnt brandy put into him. He seems all
          right to-day."</p>
  <p>"Will he go in and win?"</p>
  <p>"Chut! Win against Carlyle! He has not the ghost of a
          chance; and government—if it is the government who
          put him on it—must be a pack of fools: they can't
          know the influence of Carlyle. Bethel, is that style
          of costume the fashion where you come from?"</p>
  <p>"For cold weather and slender pockets. I'll sell 'em to
          you now, James, at half price. Let's get a look at
          this Levison, though. I have never seen the
          fellow."</p>
  <p>"Another interruption to the crowd, even as he spoke,
          caused by the railway van bringing up some luggage.
          They contrived, in the confusion, to push themselves
          to <pb n="83"/> the front, not far from Sir Francis.
          Otway Bethel stared at him in unqualified
          amazement.</p>
  <p>"Why—what brings <hi>him</hi> here? What is he
          doing?"</p>
  <p>"Who?"</p>
  <p>He pointed with his finger. "The one with the white
          handkerchief in his hand."</p>
  <p>"That is Sir Francis."</p>
  <p>"No!" uttered Bethel, a whole world of astounded meaning
          in his tone. "By Jove! <hi>He</hi> Sir Francis
          Levison?"</p>
  <p>At that moment, their eyes met, Francis Levison's and
          Otway Bethel's. Otway Bethel raised his shaggy cap
          in salutation, and Sir Francis appeared completely
          scared. Only for an instant did he lose his presence
          of mind. The next, his eye-glass was stuck in his
          eye, and turned on Mr. Bethel with a hard, haughty
          stare; as much as to say, Who are you, fellow, that
          you should take such a liberty? But his cheeks and
          lips were growing as white as marble.</p>
  <p>"Do you know Levison, Mr. Otway?" inquired old Dill.</p>
  <p>"A little. Once."</p>
  <p>"When he was not Levison, but somebody else," laughed Mr.
          Ebenezer James. "Eh, Bethel?"</p>
  <p>Bethel turned as reproving a stare on Mr. Ebenezer, as
          the baronet had just turned on him. "What do you
          mean, pray? Mind your own business."</p>
  <p>A nod to old Dill, and he turned off and disappeared,
          taking no further notice of James. The old gentleman
          questioned the latter.</p>
  <p>"What was that little bit of by-play, Mr. Ebenezer?"</p>
  <pb n="84"/>
  <p>"Nothing, much," laughed Mr. Ebenezer. "Only he," nodding
          towards Sir Francis, "was not always the great man
          that he is now."</p>
  <p>"Ah!"</p>
  <p>"I have held my tongue about it, for it's no affair of
          mine, but I don't mind letting you into the secret.
          Would you believe that that grand baronet there,
          would-be member for West Lynne, used, years ago, to
          dodge about Abbey Wood, mad after Afy Hallijohn? He
          didn't call himself Levison then."</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill felt as if a hundred pins and needles were
          pricking at his memory, for there rose up in it
          certain doubts and troubles, touching Richard Hare
          and one Thorn. He laid his eager hand upon the
          other's arm. "Ebenezer James, what did he call
          himself?"</p>
  <p>"Thorn. A dandy then, as he is now. He used to come
          galloping down the Swainson road at dusk, tie his
          horse in the wood, and monopolise Miss Afy."</p>
  <p>"How do you know this?"</p>
  <p>"Because I have seen it, a dozen times. I was spooney
          after Afy myself in those days, and went down there
          a good deal in an evening. If it hadn't been for
          him, and—perhaps that murdering villain, Dick Hare,
          Afy would have listened to me. Not that she cared
          for Dick; but, you see, they were gentlemen. I am
          thankful to the stars, now, for my luck in escaping
          her. With her for a wife, I should have been in a
          pickle always: as it is, I do get out of it once in
          a way."</p>
  <p>"Did you know then that he was Francis Levison?"</p>
  <p>"Not I. He called himself Thorn, I tell you. When he came
          down, to offer himself for member and <pb n="85"/>
          oppose Carlyle, I was thunderstruck; like Bethel
          was, a minute ago. Ho, ho, said I, so Thorn's
          defunct, and Levison has risen."</p>
  <p>"What had Otway Bethel to do with him?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing—that I know of. Only Bethel was fond of the wood
          also—after other game than Afy, though —and must
          have seen Thorn often. You saw that he recognized
          him."</p>
  <p>"Thorn—Levison, I mean—did not appear to like the
          recognition," said Mr. Dill.</p>
  <p>"Who would, in his position?" laughed Ebenezer James. "I
          don't like to be reminded of many a wild scrape of
          my past life, in my poor station; and what would it
          be for Levison, were it to come out that he once
          called himself Thorn, and came running after Miss
          Afy Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>"Why did he call himself Thorn? Why disguise his own
          name?"</p>
  <p>"Not knowing, can't say. <hi>Is</hi> his name Levison? or
          is it Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Nonsense, Mr. Ebenezer!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill, bursting with the strange news he had heard,
          endeavoured to force his way through the crowd, that
          he might communicate it to Mr. Carlyle. The crowd
          was, however, too dense for him, and he had to wait
          the opportunity of escape with what patience he
          might. When it came, he made the best of his way to
          the office, and entered Mr. Carlyle's private room.
          That gentleman was seated at his desk, signing
          letters.</p>
  <p>"Why, Dill, you are out of breath!"</p>
  <p>"Well I may be! Mr. Archibald, I have been listening to
          the most extraordinary statement. I have <pb n="86"/> found out about Thorn. Who do you think he
          is?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle laid down his pen, and looked full in the old
          man's face: he had never seen him so excited.</p>
  <p>"It's that man, Levison."</p>
  <p>"I do not understand you." said Mr. Carlyle. He did not.
          It was Hebrew to him.</p>
  <p>"The Levison of to-day, your opponent, is the Thorn who
          went after Afy Hallijohn. It is so, Mr.
          Archibald."</p>
  <p>"It cannot be!" slowly uttered Mr. Carlyle, thought upon
          thought working through his brain. "Where did you
          hear this?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill told his tale. Otway Bethel's recognition of
          him; Sir Francis Levison's scared paleness—for he
          had noticed that; Mr. Ebenezer's revelation.</p>
  <p>"Bethel has denied to me more than once that he knew
          Thorn, or was aware of such a man being in
          existence," observed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"He must have had a purpose in it," returned Mr. Dill.
          "They knew each other to-day. Levison recognised
          him, for certain; although he carried it off with a
          high hand, pretending that he did not."</p>
  <p>"And it was not as Levison, but as Thorn, that Bethel
          recognised him."</p>
  <p>"There's little doubt of that. He did not mention the
          name, Thorn; but he was evidently struck with
          astonishment at hearing that it was Levison. If they
          have not some secret between them, Mr. Archibald,
          I'll never believe my own eyes again."</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Hare's opinion is, that Bethel had to do with the
          murder," said Mr. Carlyle, in a low tone.</p>
  <pb n="87"/>
  <p>"If the murder is their secret, rely upon it Bethel had,"
          was the answer. "Mr. Archibald, it seems to me that
          now or never is the time to clear up Richard."</p>
  <p>"Ay. But how set about it?" responded Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Barbara had proceeded home in her carriage,
          her brain as busy as Mr. Carlyle's, perhaps more
          troubled. Her springing lightly and hastily out, the
          moment it stopped, disdaining the footman's arm, her
          compressed lips and absent countenance, proved that
          her resolution was set upon some plan of action.
          William and Madame Vine met her in the hall.</p>
  <p>"We have seen Dr. Martin, Mrs. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"And, mamma, he says—"</p>
  <p>"I cannot stay to hear now, William. I will see you
          later, madame."</p>
  <p>She ran up-stairs to her dressing-room, Madame Vine
          following her with her reproachful eyes. "Why should
          she care?" thought madame. "He is not her
          child."</p>
  <p>Throwing her parasol on one chair, her gloves on another,
          Barbara sat down to her writing-table. "I will write
          to him, I will have him here, if it be but for an
          hour!" she passionately exclaimed. "This shall be,
          so far, cleared up. I am sure that it is that man.
          The very action Richard described! and there was the
          diamond ring! For better, for worse, I will send for
          him: but it will not be for worse if God is with
          us."</p>
  <p>She dashed off a letter, getting up, ere she had well
          begun it, to order her carriage round again: she
          would trust none but herself to put it in the
          post.</p>
  <p>"My dear Mr. Smith,—We want you here. Something <pb n="88"/> has arisen that it is necessary to see
          you upon. You can get here by Saturday. Be in
            <hi>these</hi> grounds, near the covered walk,
          that evening at dusk.</p>
  <p>"Ever yours,</p>
  <p>"B."</p>
  <p>And the letter was addressed to Mr. Smith, of some street
          in Liverpool, the address furnished by Richard. Very
          cautious, you see, was Barbara. She even put "Mr.
          Smith" inside the letter.</p>
  <p>"Now stop," cried Barbara to herself, as she was folding
          it, "I ought to send him a five-pound note, for he
          may not have the means to come. And I don't think I
          have one of that amount in the house."</p>
  <p>She looked in her secretaire. Not a single five-pound
          note. Out of the room she ran, meeting Joyce, who
          was coming along the corridor.</p>
  <p>"Do you happen to have a five-pound note, Joyce?"</p>
  <p>"No, ma'am. Not by me."</p>
  <p>"I dare say Madame Vine has. I paid her last week, and
          there were two five-pound notes amongst it." And
          away went Barbara to the grey parlour.</p>
  <p>"Could you lend me a five-pound note, Madame Vine? I have
          occasion to enclose one in a letter, and find I do
          not possess one."</p>
  <p>Madame Vine went to her room to get it. Barbara waited.
          She asked William what Dr. Martin said.</p>
  <p>"He tried my chest with—oh, I forget what they call it;
          and he said I must be a brave boy and take my
          cod-liver oil well. And port wine, and everything I
          liked that was good. And he said he should be at
          West Lynne next Wednesday afternoon, and I am to be
          there, and he would call in and see me."</p>
  <pb n="89"/>
  <p>"Where are you to meet him?"</p>
  <p>"He said either at papa's office, or at Aunt Cornelia's,
          as we might decide. Madame fixed it for papa's
          office, for she thought he might like to see Dr.
          Martin. I say, mamma?"</p>
  <p>"What?" asked Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine has been crying ever since. Why should
          she?"</p>
  <p>"I'm sure I don't know. Crying?"</p>
  <p>"Yes: but she wipes her eyes under her spectacles, and
          thinks I don't see her. I know I am very ill, but
          why should she cry for that?"</p>
  <p>"Nonsense, William! Who told you you were very ill?"</p>
  <p>"Nobody. I suppose I am," he thoughtfully added. "If
          Joyce or Lucy, cried, now, there'd be more sense in
          it, for they have known me all my life."</p>
  <p>"You are so apt to fancy things! you are always doing it.
          It is not likely that madame would be crying because
          you were ill."</p>
  <p>Madame came in with the bank-note. Barbara thanked her,
          ran up-stairs, and in another minute or two was in
          her carriage.</p>
  <p>She was back again and dressing, when the gentlemen
          returned to dinner. Mr. Carlyle came up-stairs.
          Barbara, like most persons who do things without
          reflection, having had time to cool down from her
          ardour, was doubting whether she had acted wisely in
          sending so precipitately for Richard. She carried
          her doubt and care to her husband: her sure refuge
          in perplexity.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, I do fear I have done a foolish thing."</p>
  <pb n="90"/>
  <p>He laughed. "I fear we all do that at times, Barbara.
          What is it?"</p>
  <p>He had seated himself in one of Barbara's favourite low
          chairs, and she stood before him, leaning on his
          shoulder, her face a little behind, so that he could
          not see it. In her delicacy, she would not look at
          him, while she spoke what she was going to
          speak.</p>
  <p>"It is something that I have had upon my mind for years.
          And I did not like to tell it to you."</p>
  <p>"For years!"</p>
  <p>"You remember that night, years ago, when Richard was at
          the Grove in disguise? He—"</p>
  <p>"Which night, Barbara? He came more than once."</p>
  <p>"The night—the night that Lady Isabel quitted East
          Lynne," she answered, not knowing how better to
          bring it to his recollection: and she stole her hand
          lovingly into his, as she said it. "Richard came
          back after his departure, saying he had met Thorn in
          Bean-lane. He described the peculiar motion of his
          hand as he threw back his hair from his brow: he
          spoke of the white hand and the diamond ring, how it
          glittered in the moonlight. Do you remember?"</p>
  <p>"I do."</p>
  <p>"The motion appeared perfectly familiar to me, for I had
          seen it repeatedly used by one, then staying at East
          Lynne. I wondered you did not recognise it. From
          that night I had little doubt as to the identity of
          Thorn. I believed that he and Captain Levison were
          one."</p>
  <p>A pause. "Why did you not tell me so, Barbara?"</p>
  <pb n="91"/>
  <p>"How could I speak of that man to you?—at that time?
          Afterwards, when Richard was here, that snowy
          winter's day, he asserted that he knew Sir Francis
          Levison; that he had seen him and Thorn together;
          and that put me off the scent. But, to-day, as I was
          passing the Raven, in the carriage, going very slow
          on account of the crowd, he was perched out there,
          addressing the people, and I saw the very same
          action, the old action that I remember so well."</p>
  <p>Barbara paused. Mr. Carlyle did not interrupt her.</p>
  <p>"I feel a conviction that they are the same: that Richard
          must have been under some unaccountable mistake, in
          saying he knew Francis Levison. Besides, who, but
          he, in evening dress, would have been likely to go
          through Bean-lane that night? It leads to no houses:
          but one, who wished to avoid the high road, could
          get into it from these grounds, and so on to West
          Lynne. It was proved, you know, that he met—met the
          carriage coming from Mrs. Jeafferson's, and returned
          in it to East Lynne. He must have gone back directly
          on foot to West Lynne, to get the post-chaise, as
          was proved; and he would naturally go through
          Bean-lane. Forgive me, Archibald, for recalling
          these things to you, but I feel so sure that Levison
          and Thorn are one."</p>
  <p>"I know they are," he quietly said.</p>
  <p>Barbara, in her astonishment, drew back and stared him in
          the face. A face of severe dignity it was, just
          then.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald! Did you know it at that time?"</p>
  <p>"I did not know it until this afternoon. I never
          suspected it."</p>
  <pb n="92"/>
  <p>"I wonder you did not. I have wondered often."</p>
  <p>"So do I—now. Dill, Ebenezer James, and Otway Bethel—who
          came home to-day—were standing before the Raven,
          listening to his speech, when Bethel recognised him.
          Not as Levison: he was infinitely astonished to find
          he was Levison. Levison, they say, was scared at the
          recognition, and changed colour. Bethel would give
          no explanation, and moved away, but James told Dill
          that Levison was the man Thorn, who used to be after
          Afy Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>"How did he know?" breathlessly asked Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Because Mr. Ebenezer was after Afy himself, and
          repeatedly saw Thorn in the wood. Barbara, I believe
          now that it was Levison who killed Hallijohn: but I
          should like to know what Bethel had to do with
          it."</p>
  <p>Barbara clasped her hands. "How strange it is!" she
          exclaimed, in some excitement. "Mamma told me
          yesterday that she was convinced some discovery was
          impending relative to the murder. She had had the
          most distressing dream, she said, connected with
          Richard and Bethel and somebody else, whom she
          appeared to know in the dream, but could not
          recognise, or remember, when she awoke. She was very
          ill; she puts so much faith in these wretched
          dreams."</p>
  <p>"One would think you did also, Barbara, by your
          vehemence."</p>
  <p>"No, no; you know better. But it is strange—you must
          acknowledge that it is—that so sure as anything
          fresh happens, touching the subject of the murder,
          so sure is a troubled dream the forerunner of it.
          Mamma does not dream at other times. Bethel denied
          to you that he knew Thorn."</p>
  <pb n="93"/>
  <p>"I know he did."</p>
  <p>"And now it turns out that he does know him; and he is
          always in mamma's dreams; none more prominent in
          them than Bethel. But, Archibald, I am not telling
          you—I have sent for Richard."</p>
  <p>"You have?"</p>
  <p>"I felt sure that Levison was Thorn; I did not expect
          that others would recognise him, and I acted in the
          impulse of the moment and wrote to Richard, telling
          him to be here on Saturday evening. The letter is
          gone."</p>
  <p>"Well, we must shelter him as we best can."</p>
  <p>"Archibald, dear Archibald, what can be done to clear
          him?" she asked, the tears rising to her eyes.</p>
  <p>"I cannot act against Levison."</p>
  <p>"Not act? not act for Richard?"</p>
  <p>He bent his clear, truthful eyes upon her. "My dearest
          how can I?"</p>
  <p>She looked a little rebellious, and the tears fell.</p>
  <p>"You have not considered, Barbara. It would look like my
          own revenge."</p>
  <p>"Forgive me," she softly whispered. "You are always
          right. I did not think of it in that light. But what
          steps can be taken?"</p>
  <p>"It is a case encompassed with difficulties," mused Mr.
          Carlyle. "Let us wait till Richard comes."</p>
  <p>"Do you happen to have a five-pound note in your pocket,
          Archibald? I had not one to send to him, and
          borrowed it from Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>He took out his pocket-book and gave her the money.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER X. A FADING CHILD.</head>
  <p><hi>In</hi> the grey parlour, in the dark twilight of the
          April evening, for it was getting on into the night,
          were William Carlyle and Lady Isabel. It had been a
          warm day, but the spring evenings were still chilly,
          and a fire burned in the grate. There was no blaze,
          the red embers were smouldering and half dead, but
          Madame Vine did not heed the fire. William lay on
          the sofa, and she sat by, looking at him. Her
          glasses were off, for the tears wetted them
          continually: and it was not the recognition of the
          children that she feared. He was tired with the
          drive to Lynneborough and back, and lay with his
          eyes shut; she thought asleep. Presently he opened
          them.</p>
  <p>"How long will it be before I die?"</p>
  <p>The words took her utterly by surprise, and her heart
          went round in a whirl. "What do you mean, William?
          Who said anything about your dying?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, I know. I know by the fuss there is over me. You
          heard what Hannah said the other night?"</p>
  <p>"What? When?"</p>
  <p>"When she brought in the tea, and I was lying on the rug.
          I was not asleep, though you thought I <pb n="95"/>
          was. You told her she ought to be more cautious, for
          that I might not have been asleep."</p>
  <p>"I don't remember much about it," said Lady Isabel, at
          her wits' end how to remove the impression Hannah's
          words must have created, had he indeed heard them.
          "Hannah talks great nonsense sometimes."</p>
  <p>"She said I was going on fast to the grave."</p>
  <p>"Did she? Nobody attends to Hannah. She is only a foolish
          girl. We shall soon have you well, when the warm
          weather comes."</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>"Well, my darling?"</p>
  <p>"Where's the use of your trying to deceive me? Do you
          think I don't see that you are doing it? I am not a
          baby: you might if it were Archibald. What is it
          that's the matter with me?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing. Only you are not strong. When you get strong
          again you will be as well as ever."</p>
  <p>William shook his head in disbelief. He was precisely
          that sort of child from whom it is next to
          impossible to disguise facts; quick, thoughtful,
          observant, and advanced beyond his years. Had no
          words been dropped in his hearing, he would have
          suspected the evil by the care evinced for him, but
          plenty of words had been dropped; hints, by which he
          had gathered suspicion; broad assertions, like
          Hannah's, which had too fully supplied it: and the
          boy, in his inmost heart, knew as well that death
          was coming for him, as that death itself did.</p>
  <p>"Then, if there's nothing the matter with me, why could
          not Dr. Martain speak to you before me to-day? Why
          did he send me into the other room while he told <pb n="96"/> you what he thought? Ah, Madame Vine, I
          am as wise as you."</p>
  <p>"A wise little boy, but mistaken sometimes," she said,
          from her aching heart.</p>
  <p>"It's nothing to die, when God loves us. Lord Vane says
          so. He had a little brother who died."</p>
  <p>"A sickly child who was never likely to live; he had been
          pale and ailing from a baby," said Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Why! did you know him?"</p>
  <p>"I—I heard so," she replied, turning off her thoughtless
          avowal in the best manner she could.</p>
  <p>"Don't <hi>you</hi> know that I am going to die?"</p>
  <p>"No."</p>
  <p>"Then why have you been grieving since we left Dr.
          Martin's? And why do you grieve at all for me? I am
          not your child."</p>
  <p>The words, the scene altogether, overcame her. She knelt
          down by the sofa, and her tears burst forth freely.
          "There! you see," cried William.</p>
  <p>"Oh, William, I—I had a little boy of my own once, and
          when I look at you, I think of him, and that is why
          I cry."</p>
  <p>"I know. You have told us of him before. His name was
          William, too."</p>
  <p>She leaned over him, her breath mingling with his, she
          took his little hand in hers. "William, do you know
          that those whom God loves best, He takes the first.
          Were you to die, you would go to heaven, leaving all
          the cares and sorrows of the world behind you. It
          would have been happier for many of us had we died
          in infancy."</p>
  <p>"Would it have been happier for you?"</p>
  <pb n="97"/>
  <p>"Yes," she faintly said. "I have had more than my share
          of sorrow. Sometimes I think that I cannot support
          it."</p>
  <p>"Is it not past, then? Have you sorrow now?"</p>
  <p>"I have it always. I shall have it till I die. Had I died
          a child, William, I should have escaped it. Oh! the
          world is full of it! full and full."</p>
  <p>"What sort of sorrow?"</p>
  <p>"Pain, sickness, care, trouble, sin, remorse, weariness,"
          she wailed out. "I cannot enumerate the half that
          the world brings upon us. When you are very, very
          tired, William, does it not seem a luxury, a sweet
          happiness, to lie down at night in your little bed,
          waiting for sleep?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. And I am often tired; as tired as that."</p>
  <p>"Then, just so do we, who are tired out with the world's
          cares, long for the grave in. which we shall lie
          down to rest. We <hi>covet</hi> it, William; long
          for it; almost pray for it: but you cannot
          understand that."</p>
  <p>" <hi>We</hi> don't lie in the grave, Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>"No, no, child. Our bodies lie there, to be raised again
          in beauty at the last day. We go into a blessed
          place of rest, where sorrow and pain cannot come. I
          wish—I wish," she added with a bursting heart, "that
          you and I were both there!"</p>
  <p>"Who says the world is so sorrowful, Madame Vine? I think
          it is lovely, especially when the sun's shinning on
          a hot day, and the butterflies come out. You should
          see East Lynne on a summer's morning, when you are
          running up and down the slopes, and the trees are
          waving overhead, and the sky's blue, and the roses
          and flowers are all out. You would not call it a sad
          world."</p>
  <pb n="98"/>
  <p>"A pleasant world; one we might regret to leave, if we
          were not wearied by pain and care. But, what is this
          world, take it at its best, in comparison with that
          other world, heaven? I have heard of some people who
          are afraid of death: they fear they shall not go to
          it: but when God takes a little child there, it is
          because He loves him. It is a land, as Mrs. Barbauld
          says, where the roses are without thorns, where the
          flowers are not mixed with brambles—"</p>
  <p>"I have seen the flowers," interrupted William, rising in
          his earnestness. "They are ten times brighter than
          our flowers are here."</p>
  <p>"Seen the flowers! The flowers we shall see in heaven!"
          she echoed.</p>
  <p>"I have seen a picture of them. We went to Lynneborough
          to see Martin's pictures of the Last Judgment. I
          don't mean Dr. Martin," said William, interrupting
          himself.</p>
  <p>"I know."</p>
  <p>"There were three large pictures. One was called the
          'Plains of Heaven,' and I liked that best; and so we
          all did. Oh, you should have seen it! Did you ever
          see them, Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>"No. I have heard of them."</p>
  <p>"There was a river, you know, and boats, beautiful
          gondolas they looked, taking the redeemed to the
          shores of heaven. They were shadowy figures in white
          robes, myriads and myriads of them, for they reached
          all up in the air to the holy city: it seemed to be
          in the clouds, coming down from God. The flowers
          grew on the banks of the river, pink and blue, and
          violet; all colours they were, but so bright and
          beautiful; brighter than our flowers are."</p>
  <pb n="99"/>
  <p>"Who took you to see the pictures?"</p>
  <p>"Papa. He took me and Lucy: and Mrs. Hare went with us,
          and Barbara—she was not our mamma then. But,
          madame"—dropping his voice—"what do you think Lucy
          asked papa?"</p>
  <p>"What did she ask him?"</p>
  <p>"She asked whether mamma was amongst that crowd in the
          white robes; whether she was gone up to heaven? Our
          mamma that was, you know: Lady Isabel. We were in
          front of the picture at the time, and lots of people
          heard what she said."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel dropped her face upon her hands. "What did
          your papa answer?" she breathed.</p>
  <p>"I don't know. Nothing, I think: he was talking to
          Barbara. But it was very stupid of Lucy, because
          Wilson has told her over and over again that she
          must never talk of Lady Isabel to papa. Miss Manning
          has told her so too. When we got home, and Wilson
          heard of it, she said Lucy deserved a good
          shaking."</p>
  <p>"Why must Lady Isabel not be talked of to him?" A moment
          after the question had left her lips, she wondered
          what possessed her to give utterance to it.</p>
  <p>"I'll tell you," said William, in a whisper, "She ran
          away from papa. Lucy talks nonsense about her having
          been kidnapped, but she knows nothing. I do; though
          they don't think it, perhaps."</p>
  <p>"She may be among the redeemed some time, William, and
          you with her."</p>
  <p>He fell back on the sofa pillow with a weary sigh, and
          lay in silence. Lady Isabel shaded her face and
          remained in silence also. Soon she was aroused from
          it: William was in a fit of loud, sobbing tears.</p>
  <pb n="100"/>
  <p>"Oh, I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Why should
          I go, and leave papa and Lucy?"</p>
  <p>She hung over him; she clasped her arms round him; her
          tears, her sobs, mingled with his. She whispered to
          him sweet and soothing words; she placed him so that
          he might sob out his grief upon her bosom: and in a
          little while the paroxysm had passed.</p>
  <p>"Hark!" exclaimed William. "What's that?"</p>
  <p>A sound of talking and laughter in the hall. Mr. Carlyle,
          Lord Mount Severn, and his son were leaving the
          dining-room. They had some committee appointment
          that evening at West Lynne, and were departing to
          keep it. As the hall door closed upon them, Barbara
          came into the grey parlour. Up rose Madame Vine,
          hastily assumed her spectacles, and took her seat
          soberly upon a chair.</p>
  <p>"All in the dark! And your fire going out!" exclaimed
          Barbara, as she hastened to stir the latter and send
          it into a blaze. "Who is that on the sofa? William!
          you ought to be in bed."</p>
  <p>"Not yet, mamma. I don't want to go yet."</p>
  <p>"But it is quite time that you should," she returned,
          ringing the bell. "To sit up at night is not the way
          to make you strong."</p>
  <p>William was dismissed. And then she turned to Madame Vine
          and inquired what Dr. Martin had said.</p>
  <p>"He said the lungs were undoubtedly affected; but, like
          all doctors, he would give no decisive opinion. I
          could see that he had formed one."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carlyle looked at her. The firelight played upon her
          face, played especially upon the spectacles, and she
          moved her chair into the shade.</p>
  <p>"Dr. Martin will see him again next week: he is <pb n="101"/> coming to West Lynne. I am sure, by the
          tone of his voice, by his evasive manner, that he
          anticipates the worst, although he would not say so
          in words."</p>
  <p>"I will take William into West Lynne myself," said
          Barbara. "The doctor will, of course, tell me. I
          came in to pay my debts," she added, dismissing the
          subject of the child, and holding out a five-pound
          note.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel mechanically stretched out her hand for
          it.</p>
  <p>"Whilst we are upon the money topic," resumed Barbara, in
          a gay tone, "will you allow me to intimate that both
          myself and Mr. Carlyle very much disapprove of your
          making presents to the children? I was calculating,
          at a rough guess, the cost of the toys and things
          you have bought for them, and I think it must amount
          to a very large portion of the salary you have
          received. Pray do not continue this, Madame
          Vine."</p>
  <p>"I have no one else to spend my money on: I love the
          children," was madame's answer, somewhat sharply
          given, as if she were jealous of the interference
          between her and the children, and would resent
          it.</p>
  <p>"Nay, you have yourself. And if you do not require much
          outlay, you have, I should suppose, a reserve fund
          to which to put your money. Be so kind as take the
          hint, madame; otherwise I shall be compelled more
          peremptorily to forbid your generosity. It is very
          good of you, very kind; but if you do not think of
          yourself, we must, for you."</p>
  <p>"I will buy them less," was the murmured answer. "I must
          give them a little token of love now and then."</p>
  <p>"That you are welcome to do; a 'little token,' once in a
          way: but not the costly toys you have been
          purchasing. <pb n="102"/> Have you ever had any
          acquaintance with Sir Francis Levison?" continued
          Mrs. Carlyle, passing with abruptness from one topic
          to another.</p>
  <p>An inward shiver, a burning cheek, a heart-pang of wild
          remorse, and a faint answer. "No."</p>
  <p>"I fancied, from your manner when I was speaking of him
          the other day, that you knew him, or had known him.
          No compliment, you will say, to assume an
          acquaintanceship with such a man. He is a stranger
          to you, then?"</p>
  <p>Another faint reply. "Yes."</p>
  <p>Barbara paused. "Do you believe in fatality, Madame
          Vine?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I do," was the steady answer.</p>
  <p>"I don't:" and yet, the very question proved that she did
          not wholly disbelieve it. "No, I don't," added
          Barbara, stoutly, as she approached the sofa,
          vacated by William and sat down upon it, thus
          bringing herself opposite and near to Madame Vine.
          "Are you aware that it was Francis Levison who
          wrought the evil to this house?"</p>
  <p>"The evil—" stammered Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"Yes, it was he," she resumed, taking the hesitating
          answer for an admission that the governess knew
          nothing, or but little, of past events. "It was he
          who took Lady Isabel from her home—though, perhaps,
          she was as willing to go, as he to take her: I do
          not know—"</p>
  <p>"Oh no, no!" broke from the unguarded lips of Madame
          Vine. "At least—I mean—I should think not," she
          added, in confusion.</p>
  <p>"We shall never know. And of what consequence is it? One
          thing is certain, <hi>she went:</hi> another thing,
            <pb n="103"/> almost equally certain, is, she did
          not go against her will. Did you ever hear the
          details?"</p>
  <p>"No—o." Her answer would have been Yes; but possibly the
          next question might have been, From whom did you
          hear them?</p>
  <p>"He was staying at East Lynne. The man had been abroad;
          outlawed: dared not show his face in England, and
          Mr. Carlyle, in his generosity, invited him to East
          Lynne as a place of shelter where he would be safe
          from his creditors, while something was arranged. He
          was a connexion of Lady Isabel's. And they repaid
          Mr. Carlyle, he and she, by quitting East Lynne
          together."</p>
  <p>"Why did Mr. Carlyle give that invitation!" The words
          were uttered in a spirit of remorseful wailing: Mrs.
          Carlyle believed they were a question put; and she
          rose up haughtily against it.</p>
  <p>"Why did he give the invitation! Did I hear you aright,
          Madame Vine? Did Mr. Carlyle know he was a
          reprobate? And, if he had known it, was not Lady
          Isabel his wife? Could he dream of danger for her?
          If it pleased Mr. Carlyle to fill East Lynne with
          bad men to-morrow, what would that be to me?—to my
          safety; to my well-being; to my love and allegiance
          to my husband? What were you thinking of,
          madame?"</p>
  <p>Thinking of! She leaned her troubled head upon her hand.
          Mrs. Carlyle resumed.</p>
  <p>"Sitting alone in the drawing-room just now, and thinking
          matters over, it did seem to me very like what
          people call a fatality. That man, I say, was the one
          who wrought the disgrace, the trouble, to Mr.
          Carlyle's family; and it is he, I have every reason
          now to believe, who brought equal disgrace and
          trouble upon <pb n="104"/> mine. Did you know"—Mrs.
          Carlyle lowered her voice—"that I have a brother in
          exile—in shame?"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel did not dare to answer that she did know it.
          Who had there been, likely to inform her, the
          strange governess, of the tale of Richard Hare?</p>
  <p>"So the world calls it—shame," pursued Barbara, growing
          excited. "And it is shame—but not as the world
          thinks it. The shame lies with another, who has
          thrust the suffering and shame upon Richard: and
          that other is Francis Levison. "I will tell you the
          tale. It is worth the telling."</p>
  <p>She could only dispose herself to listen; but she
          wondered what Francis Levison had to do with Richard
          Hare.</p>
  <p>"In the days long gone by, when I was little more than a
          child, Richard went after Afy Hallijohn. You have
          seen the cottage in the wood: she lived there with
          her father and Joyce. It was very foolish of him:
          but young men will be foolish. Many more went after
          her—or wanted to go after her. Among them, chief of
          them, more favoured even than Richard, was one
          called Thorn, by social position a gentleman. He was
          a stranger, and used to ride over in secret. A night
          of murder came; a dreadful murder: Hallijohn was
          shot down dead. Richard ran away; testimony was
          strong against him, and the coroner's jury brought
          in a verdict of 'Wilful Murder against Richard Hare
          the younger.' We never supposed but what he was
          guilty—of the act, mind you; not of the intention:
          even mamma, who so loved him, believed he had done
          it; but she believed it was the result of accident,
          not design. Oh, the trouble that has been the lot of
          my poor mamma!" cried Barbara, clasping her hands.
            <pb n="105"/> "And she had no one to sympathize
          with her, no one, no one! I, as I tell you, was
          little more than a child; and papa, who might have
          done it, took part against Richard. The sorrow went
          on for three or four years, and there was no
          mitigation. At the end of that period Richard came
          for a few hours to West Lynne, came in secret, and
          we learnt for the first time that he was
            <hi>not</hi> guilty. The man who did the deed was
          Thorn; Richard was not even present. The next
          question was, how to find Thorn. Nobody knew
          anything about him: who he was, what he was; where
          he came from, where he went to: and thus more years
          passed on Another Thorn came to West Lynne; an
          officer in her Majesty's service; and his appearance
          tallied with the description Richard had given. I
          assumed it to be the one; Mr. Carlyle assumed it;
          but, before anything could be done, or even thought
          of, Captain Thorn was gone again."</p>
  <p>Barbara paused to take breath. Madame Vine sat, listless
          enough. What was this tale to her?</p>
  <p>"Again, years went on. The period came of Francis
          Levison's sojourn at East Lynne. Whilst he was
          there, Captain Thorn arrived once more, on a visit
          to the Herberts. We then strove to find out points
          of his antecedents, Mr. Carlyle and I, and we became
          nearly convinced that he was the man. I had to come
          here often to see Mr. Carlyle, for mamma did not
          dare to stir in the affair, papa was so violent
          against Richard. Thus I often saw Francis Levison:
          but he was visible to no other visitor, being at
          East Lynne, <hi>en cachette</hi> . He intimated that
          he was afraid of encountering creditors: I now begin
          to doubt whether that was not a false plea: and I
          remember Mr. Carlyle said, at <pb n="106"/> the
          time, that he had no creditors in or near West
          Lynne."</p>
  <p>"Then, what was his motive for shunning society; for
          never going out?" interrupted Lady Isabel. Too well
          she remembered that bygone time: Francis Levison had
          told her that the fear of his creditors kept him up
          so closely; though he had once said to her they were
          not in the immediate neighbourhood of East
          Lynne.</p>
  <p>"He had a worse fear upon him than that of creditors,"
          returned Mrs. Carlyle. "Singular to say, during this
          visit of Captain Thorn to the Herberts, we received
          an intimation from my brother that he was once more
          about to venture for a few hours to West Lynne. I
          brought the news to Mr. Carlyle; I had to see him
          and consult with him more frequently than ever:
          mamma was painfully restless and anxious, and Mr.
          Carlyle as eager as we were for the establishment of
          Richard's innocence, for Miss Carlyle and papa are
          related, consequently the disgrace may be said to
          reflect on the Carlyle name."</p>
  <p>Back went Lady Isabel's memory and her bitter repentance.
          She remembered how jealously she had attributed
          these meetings between Mr. Carlyle and Barbara to
          another source. Oh, why had she suffered her mind to
          be so falsely and fatally perverted?</p>
  <p>"Richard came. It was hastily arranged that he should go
          privately to Mr. Carlyle's office, after the clerks
          had left for the night, be concealed there, and have
          an opportunity given him of seeing Captain Thorn.
          There was no difficulty, for Mr. Carlyle was
          transacting some matter of business for the captain,
          and appointed him to be at the office at eight
          o'clock. A memorable <pb n="107"/> night, that, to
          Mr. Carlyle, for it was the one of his wife's
          elopement."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel looked up with a start.</p>
  <p>"It was, indeed. She, Lady Isabel, and Mr. Carlyle, were
          engaged to a dinner party: and Mr. Carlyle had to
          give it up, otherwise he could not have served
          Richard. He is always considerate and kind, thinking
          of others' welfare; never of his own gratification.
          Oh, it was an anxious night! Papa was out. I waited
          at home with mamma, doing what I could to soothe her
          restless suspense: for there was hazard to Richard
          in his night walk through West Lynne to keep the
          appointment: and, when it was over, he was to come
          home for a short interview with mamma, who had not
          seen him for several years."</p>
  <p>Barbara stopped, lost in thought. Not a word spoke Madame
          Vine. She still wondered what this affair, touching
          Richard Hare and Captain Thorn, could have to do
          with Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>"I watched from the window, and saw them come in at the
          garden gate, Mr. Carlyle and Richard—between nine
          and ten o'clock I think it must have been. The first
          words they said to me were, that it was not the
          Captain Thorn spoken of by Richard. I felt a shock
          of disappointment, which was wicked enough of me,
          but I had been so sure he was the man; and, to hear
          he was not, seemed to throw us further back than
          ever. Mr. Carlyle, on the contrary, was glad, for he
          had taken a liking for Captain Thorn. Well, Richard
          went in to mamma, and Mr. Carlyle was so kind as to
          accede to her request that he would remain and pace
          the garden with me. We were so afraid of papa's
          coming home: he was bitter against Richard, and
          would inevitably <pb n="108"/> have delivered him up
          at once to justice. Had he come in, Mr. Carlyle was
          to keep him in the garden by the gate, whilst I ran
          in to give notice and conceal Richard in the hall.
          Richard lingered; papa did not come; and I cannot
          tell how long we paced there: it was a lovely
          moonlight night."</p>
  <p>That unhappy listener clasped her hands to pain. The
          matter-of-fact tone, the unconscious mention of
          common-place trifles, proved that they had not been
          pacing about in disloyalty to her, or for their own
          gratification. <hi>Why</hi> had she not trusted her
          noble husband? why had she listened to that false
          man, as he pointed them out to her, walking there in
          the moonlight? Why had she given vent, in the
          chariot, to that burst of passionate tears, of angry
          reproach? why, oh why had she hastened to be
          revenged? But for seeing them together, she might
          not have done as she did.</p>
  <p>"Richard came forth at last, and departed; to be again an
          exile. Mr. Carlyle also departed; and I remained at
          the gate, watching for papa. By-and-bye Mr. Carlyle
          came back again: he had got nearly home when he
          remembered that he had left a parchment at our
          house. It seemed to be nothing but coming back, for,
          just after he had gone a second time, Richard
          returned in a state of excitement, stating that he
          had met Thorn—Thorn, the murderer, I mean, in
          Bean-lane. For a moment I doubted him, but not for
          long, and we ran after Mr. Carlyle. Richard
          described Thorn's appearance; his evening dress, his
          white hands, and his diamond ring; more particularly
          he described a peculiar motion of his hand as he
          threw back his hair. In that moment it flashed
          across me that Thorn must be Captain <pb n="109"/>
          Levison; the description was exact. Many and many a
          time since, have I wondered that the thought did not
          strike Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel sat with her mouth open, as if she could not
          take in the sense of the words: and when it did
          become clear to her, she utterly rejected it.</p>
  <p>"Francis Levison a murderer! Oh no. Bad man as he is, he
          is not that."</p>
  <p>"Wait," said Mrs. Carlyle. "I did not speak of this
          doubt—nay, this conviction—which had come to me: how
          could I mention to Mr. Carlyle the name of the man
          who did him that foul wrong?—and Richard has
          remained in exile, with the ban of guilt upon him.
          To-day, as I passed through West Lynne in the
          carriage, Francis Levison was haranguing the people.
          I saw that very same action—the throwing back of the
          hair with his white hand: I saw the self-same
          diamond ring; and my conviction, that he was the
          man, became more firmly seated than ever."</p>
  <p>"It is impossible," murmured Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Wait, I say," said Barbara. "When Mr. Carlyle came home
          this evening to dinner, I, for the first time,
          mentioned this to him. It was no news—the fact was
          not. This afternoon, during that same harangue,
          Francis Levison was recognised by two witnesses to
          be the man Thorn—the man who went after Afy
          Hallijohn. It is horrible."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel sat, and looked at Mrs. Carlyle. Not yet did
          she believe it.</p>
  <p>"Yes, it does appear to me as being perfectly horrible,"
          continued Mrs. Carlyle. "He murdered Hallijohn: he,
          that bad man; and my poor brother has suffered the
          odium. When Richard met him that <pb n="110"/> night
          in Bean-lane, he was sneaking to West Lynne in
          search of the chaise that afterwards bore away him
          and his companion. Papa saw them drive away. Papa
          stayed out late; and, in returning home, a chaise
          and four tore past, just as he was coming in at the
          gate. If that miserable Lady Isabel had but known
          with whom she was flying! A murderer! in addition to
          his other achievements! It is a mercy for her that
          she is no longer alive. What would her feelings
          be?"</p>
  <p>What were they, then, as she sat there? A
            <hi>murderer!</hi> and she had— In spite of her
          caution, of her strife for self-command, she turned
          of a deadly whiteness, and a low sharp cry of horror
          and despair burst from her lips.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carlyle was astonished. Why should her communication
          have produced this effect upon Madame Vine? A
          renewed suspicion, that she knew more of Francis
          Levison than she would acknowledge, stole over
          her.</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine, what is he to you?" she asked, bending
          forward.</p>
  <p>Madame Vine, doing fierce battle with herself, recovered
          her outward equanimity. "I beg your pardon, Mrs.
          Carlyle," she shivered: "I am apt to picture things
          too vividly. It is, as you say, so very
          horrible."</p>
  <p>"Is he nothing to you? Do you know him?"</p>
  <p>"He is nothing to me; less than nothing. As to knowing
          him—I saw him yesterday when they put him into the
          pond. A man like that! I should shudder to meet
          him."</p>
  <p>"Ay, indeed," said Barbara, reassured. "You will
          understand, Madame Vine, that this history has been
            <pb n="111"/> given you in confidence. I look upon
          you as one of ourselves."</p>
  <p>There was no answer. Madame Vine sat on, with her white
          face. It wore altogether a ghastly look.</p>
  <p>"It tells like a fable out of a romance," resumed Mrs.
          Carlyle. "Well for him if the romance be not ended
          with the gibbet. Fancy what it would be—for him, Sir
          Francis Levison, to be hanged for murder!"</p>
  <p>"Barbara, my dearest!"</p>
  <p>The voice was Mr. Carlyle's, and she flew off on the
          wings of love. It appeared that the gentlemen had
          not yet departed, and now thought they would take
          coffee first.</p>
  <p>Flew off to her idolised husband, leaving her, who had
          once been the idolised, to her loneliness. She sank
          down on the sofa; she threw her arms up in her
          heart-sickness; she thought she should faint; she
          prayed to die. It <hi>was</hi> horrible, as Barbara
          had called it. For that man, with the red stain upon
          his hand and soul, she had flung away Archibald
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>If ever retribution came home to woman, it came home in
          that hour to Lady Isabel.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XI. MR. CARLYLE INVITED TO SOME PATÉ DE FOIE
          GRAS.</head>
  <p><hi>A sighing</hi> , moaning wind swept round the domains
          of East Lynne. Bending the tall poplar-trees in the
          distance, swaying the oak and elms nearer, rustling
          the fine old chesnuts in the park: a melancholy,
          sweeping, fitful wind. The weather had changed,
          gathering clouds seemed to be threatening rain: so,
          at least, deemed one wayfarer, who was journeying on
          a solitary road, that Saturday night.</p>
  <p>He was on foot. A man in the garb of a sailor, with black
          curling ringlets of hair, and black curling
          whiskers: a prodigious pair of whiskers, hiding his
          neck above his blue, turned collar, hiding partially
          his face. The glazed hat, brought low upon the
          brows, concealed it still more; and he wore a loose,
          rough pea-jacket, and wide rough trousers, hitched
          up with a belt. Bearing steadily on, he struck into
          Bean-lane, a by-way already mentioned in this
          history, and from thence, passing through a small,
          unfrequented gate, he found himself in the grounds
          of East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Let's see," mused he, as he closed the gate behind him,
          and slipped its bolt. "The covered walk? That must
          be near the acacia-trees. Then I must wind <pb n="113"/> round to the right. I wonder if either
          of them will be there, waiting for me?"</p>
  <p>Yes. Pacing the covered walk in her bonnet and mantle, as
          if taking an evening stroll—had any one encountered
          her, which was very unlikely, seeing that it was the
          most retired spot in the grounds—was Mrs.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Richard! my poor brother!"</p>
  <p>Locked in a yearning embrace, emotion overpowered both.
          Barbara sobbed like a child. A little while, and
          then he put her from-him, to look at her.</p>
  <p>"So, Barbara, you are a wife now!"</p>
  <p>"Oh, the happiest wife! Richard, sometimes I ask myself
          what I have done, that God should have showered down
          blessings so great upon me. But for the sad trouble
          when I think of you, my life would be as one long
          summer's day. I have the sweetest baby; he is now
          nearly a year old—I shall have another soon, God
          willing. And Archibald—oh, I am so happy!"</p>
  <p>She broke suddenly off with the name "Archibald:" not
          even to Richard could she speak of her intense love
          for her husband.</p>
  <p>"How is it at the Grove?" he asked.</p>
  <p>"Quite well; quite as usual. Mamma has been in better
          health lately. She does not know of this visit,
          but—"</p>
  <p>"I must see her," interrupted Richard. "I did not see her
          last time, you remember."</p>
  <p>"All in good time to talk of that. How are you getting on
          in Liverpool? What are you doing?"</p>
  <p>"Don't inquire too closely, Barbara. I have no regular
          work, but I get a job at the docks, now and <pb n="114"/> then, and rub on. It is seasonable help,
          that, which comes to me from you. Is it from you, or
          Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>Barbara laughed. "How are we to distinguish? His money is
          mine now, and mine is his. We have not separate
          purses, Richard; we send it to you jointly."</p>
  <p>"Sometimes I have fancied it came from my mother."</p>
  <p>Barbara shook her head. "We have never allowed mamma to
          know that you left London, or that we hold an
          address where we can write to you. It would not have
          done."</p>
  <p>"Why have you summoned me here, Barbara? What has turned
          up?"</p>
  <p>"Thorn has—I think. You would know him again,
          Richard?"</p>
  <p>"Know him!" passionately echoed Richard Hare.</p>
  <p>"Were you aware that a contest for the membership is now
          going on at West Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"I saw it in the newspapers. Carlyle against Sir Francis
          Levison. I say, Barbara, how could he think of
          coming here, to oppose Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>" <hi>I</hi> don't know," said Barbara. "I wonder that he
          should come here for other reasons also. First of
          all, Richard, tell me how you came to know Sir
          Francis Levison. You said you knew him, and that you
          had seen him with Thorn."</p>
  <p>"So I do know him," answered Richard. "And I saw him with
          Thorn twice."</p>
  <p>"Know him by sight only, I presume. Let me hear how you
          came to know him."</p>
  <p>"He was pointed out to me. I saw Thorn walking arm-in-arm
          with a gentleman, and I showed them to <pb n="115"/>
          the waterman at the cab-stand hard by. 'Do you know
          that fellow?' I asked him, indicating Thorn, for I
          wanted to come at who he really is. 'I don't know
          that one,' the old chap answered, 'but the one with
          him is Levison the baronet. They are often together;
          a couple of swells, both.' And a couple of swells
          they looked."</p>
  <p>"And that was how you got to know Levison?"</p>
  <p>"That was it," said Richard Hare.</p>
  <p>"Then, Richard, you and the waterman made a mistake
          between you. He pointed out the wrong, or you did
          not look at the right. Thorn is Sir Francis
          Levison."</p>
  <p>Richard stared at her with all his eyes. "Nonsense,
          Barbara!"</p>
  <p>"He is. I have suspected it ever since the night you saw
          him in Bean-lane. The action you described, of his
          pushing back his hair, his white hands, his
          sparkling diamond ring, could only apply to one
          person; Francis Levison. On Thursday I drove by the
          Raven when he was addressing the people, and I
          noticed the self-same action. In the impulse of the
          moment I wrote off for you, that you might come and
          set the doubt at rest. I need not have done so: for
          when Mr. Carlyle returned home that evening and I
          acquainted him with what I had done, he told me that
          Thorn and Francis Levison are one and the same.
          Otway Bethel recognised him that same afternoon; and
          so did Ebenezer James."</p>
  <p>"They would both know him," cried Richard eagerly. "James
          I am positive would, for he was skulking down to
          Hallijohn's often then, and saw Thorn a dozen <pb n="116"/> times. Otway Bethel must have seen him
          also—though he protested he had not. Barbara!"</p>
  <p>The name was uttered in affright, and Richard plunged
          amidst the trees, for somebody was in sight. A tall,
          dark form, advancing from the end of the walk.
          Barbara smiled; it was only Mr. Carlyle; and Richard
          emerged again.</p>
  <p>"Fears still, Richard!" Mr. Carlyle exclaimed, as he
          shook Richard cordially by the hand. "So! you have
          changed your travelling costume!"</p>
  <p>"I couldn't venture here again in the old suit; it had
          been seen, you said," returned Richard. "I bought
          this rig-out yesterday, second-hand. Two pounds for
          the lot: I think they shaved me."</p>
  <p>"Ringlets and all?" laughed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It's the old hair, oiled and curled," cried Dick. "The
          barber charged a shilling for doing it, and cut my
          hair into the bargain. I told him not to spare
          grease, for I liked the curls to shine: sailors
          always do. Mr. Carlyle, Barbara says that Levison
          and that brute Thorn have turned out to be the
          same."</p>
  <p>"They have, Richard; as it appears. Nevertheless, it may
          be as well for you to take a private view of
          Levison, before anything is done—as you once did of
          the other Thorn. It would not do to make a stir, and
          then discover that there was a mistake—that he was
          not Thorn."</p>
  <p>"When can I see him?" asked Richard eagerly.</p>
  <p>"It must be contrived, somehow. Were you to hang about
          the doors of the Raven—this evening—you'd be sure to
          get the opportunity, for he is always passing in and
          out. No one will know you; or think of you either:
          their heads are turned with the election."</p>
  <pb n="117"/>
  <p>"I shall look odd to people's eyes. You don't see many
          sailors in West Lynne,"</p>
  <p>"Not odd at all. We have a Russian bear here at present;
          and you'll be nobody, beside him."</p>
  <p>"A Russian bear!" repeated Richard, while Barbara
          laughed.</p>
  <p>"Mr. Otway Bethel has returned in what is popularly
          supposed to be a bear's hide; hence the new name he
          is greeted with. Will it turn out, Richard, that he
          had anything to do with the murder?"</p>
  <p>Richard shook his head. "It was not possible, Mr.
          Carlyle: I have said so all along. But, about
          Levison? If I find him to be the man Thorn—what
          steps can then be taken?"</p>
  <p>"That's the difficulty," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Who will set it agoing? Who will move in it?"</p>
  <p>"You must, Richard."</p>
  <p>"I?" uttered Richard Hare, in consternation, " <hi>I</hi>
          move in it?"</p>
  <p>"You, yourself. Who else is there? I have been thinking
          it well over."</p>
  <p>"Will you not take it upon yourself, Mr. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"No. Being Levison," was the quiet answer.</p>
  <p>"Curse him!" impetuously retorted Richard. "But why
          should you scruple, Mr. Carlyle? Most men, wronged
          as you have been, would leap at the opportunity for
          revenge."</p>
  <p>"For the crime perpetrated upon Hallijohn, I would pursue
          him to the scaffold. For my own wrong, no. But, the
          remaining negative, has cost me something. Many a
          time, since this appearance of his at West Lynne,
          have I been obliged to exercise violent control <pb n="118"/> upon myself, or I should have
          horsewhipped him within an ace of his life."</p>
  <p>"If you horsewhipped him to death, he would only meet his
          deserts."</p>
  <p>"I leave him to a Higher retribution: to One who says
          'Vengeance is mine.' I believe him to be guilty of
          the murder: but, if the lifting of my finger would
          send him to his disgraceful death, I would tie down
          my hands, rather than lift it. For I could not, in
          my own mind, separate the man from my injury. Though
          I might ostensibly pursue him as the destroyer of
          Hallijohn, to me he would appear ever as the
          destroyer of another; and the world, always
          charitable, would congratulate Mr. Carlyle upon
          gratifying his revenge. I stir in it not,
          Richard."</p>
  <p>"Couldn't Barbara?" pleaded Richard.</p>
  <p>Barbara was standing with her arm entwined within her
          husband's, and Mr. Carlyle looked down at her as he
          answered.</p>
  <p>"Barbara is my wife." It was a sufficient answer.</p>
  <p>"Then the thing's again at an end," said Richard,
          gloomily, "and I must give up hope of ever being
          cleared."</p>
  <p>"By no means," said Mr. Carlyle. "The one who ought to
          act in this, is your father, Richard: but we know he
          will not. Your mother cannot: she has neither health
          nor energy for it; and if she had a full supply of
          both, she would not dare to brave her husband and
          use them in the cause. My hands are tied: Barbara's
          equally so, as part of me. There only remains
          yourself."</p>
  <p>"And what can I do?" wailed poor Dick "If your hands are
          tied, I'm sure my whole body is; <pb n="119"/>
          hands, and legs, and <hi>neck</hi> . It's in
          jeopardy, that is, every hour."</p>
  <p>"Your acting in this affair need not put it any the more
          in jeopardy. You must stay in the neighbourhood for
          a few days—"</p>
  <p>"I dare not," interposed Richard, in a fright. "Stay in
          the neighbourhood for a few days! No; that I never
          may."</p>
  <p>"Listen, Richard. You must put away these timorous fears;
          or else you must make up your mind to remain under
          the ban for good: and, remember, your mother's
          happiness is at stake equally with yours —I could
          almost say her life. Do you suppose I would advise
          you for danger? You used to say there was some
          place, a mile or two from this, where you could
          sojourn in safety."</p>
  <p>"And so there is. But I always feel safer when I get away
          from it."</p>
  <p>"There your quarters must be, for two or three days, at
          any rate. I have turned matters over in my own mind,
          and will tell you what I think should be done, so
          far as the preliminary step goes."</p>
  <p>"Only the preliminary step! There must be a pretty many
          to follow it, sir, if it's to come to anything.
          Well, what is it?"</p>
  <p>"Apply to Ball and Treadman; and get them to take it
          up."</p>
  <p>They were now slowly pacing the covered walk, Barbara on
          her husband's arm; Richard by the side of Mr.
          Carlyle. Dick stopped when he heard the last
          words.</p>
  <p>"I don't understand, you, Mr. Carlyle. You might as well
          advise me to go before the bench of magistrates <pb n="120"/> at once. Ball and Treadman would walk me
          off there as soon as I showed myself."</p>
  <p>"Nothing of the sort, Richard. I do not tell you to go
          openly to their office, as another client would.
          What I would advise, is this: Make a friend of Mr.
          Ball; he can be a good man and true, if he chooses:
          tell the whole story to him in a private place and
          interview, and ask him whether he will carry it
          through. If he is as fully impressed with the
          conviction that you are innocent and the other
          guilty, as the facts appear to warrant, he will
          undertake it. Treadman need know nothing of the
          affair at first; and when Ball puts things in
          motion, he need not know where you are to be
          found."</p>
  <p>"I don't dislike Ball," mused Richard: "and if he would
          only give his word to be true, I know he would be.
          The difficulty will be, who is to get the promise
          from him?"</p>
  <p>"I will," said Mr. Carlyle. "I will so far pave the way
          for you. That done, my interference is over."</p>
  <p>"How will he go about it, think you—if he does take it
          up?"</p>
  <p>"That is his affair. I know how I should."</p>
  <p>"How sir?"</p>
  <p>"You cannot expect me to say, Richard. I might as well
          act for you."</p>
  <p>"I know. You'd go at it slap dash, and arrest Levison
          off-hand, on the charge."</p>
  <p>A smile parted Mr. Carlyle's lips, for Dick had just
          guessed it.</p>
  <p>A thought flashed across Richard's mind; a thought which
          rose up on end even his false hair. "Mr. Carlyle!"
          he uttered, in an accent of horror, "if Ball <pb n="121"/> should take it up, in that way, against
          Levison, he must apply to the bench for a
          warrant!"</p>
  <p>"Well?" quietly returned Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"And they'd send and clap me into prison! You know the
          warrant is always out against me."</p>
  <p>"You would never make a conjuror, Richard. I don't
          pretend to say, or guess, what Ball's proceedings
          may be. But, in applying to the bench for a warrant
          against Levison—should that form part of them—is
          there any necessity for him to bring you in?—to say,
          'Gentlemen, Richard Hare is within reach, ready to
          be taken?' Your fears run away with your common
          sense, Richard."</p>
  <p>"Ah, well; if you had lived with the cord round your neck
          this many a year, not knowing, any one hour, but it
          might get tied the next, you would lose your common
          sense too at times," humbly sighed poor Richard.
          "What's to be my first move, sir?"</p>
  <p>"Your first move, Richard, must be to go to this place of
          concealment, which you know of, and remain quiet
          there until Monday. On Monday, at dusk, be here
          again. Meanwhile, I will see Ball. By the way,
          though, before speaking to Ball, I must hear from
          yourself that Thorn and Levison are one."</p>
  <p>"I'll go down to the Raven at once," eagerly cried
          Richard. "I'll come back here, into this walk, as
          soon as I have obtained sight of him." With the last
          words, he turned, and was speeding off, when Barbara
          caught him.</p>
  <p>"You will be so tired, Richard!"</p>
  <p>"Tired!" echoed Richard Hare. "A hundred miles on foot
          would not tire me if Thorn was at the end of them,
          waiting to be identified. I may not be back for <pb n="122"/> two or three hours, but I will come; and
          wait here till you come out to me."</p>
  <p>"You must be hungry and thirsty," returned Barbara, the
          tears in her eyes. "How I wish we dare have you in,
          and shelter you. But I can manage to bring some
          refreshment out here."</p>
  <p>"I don't require it, Barbara. I left the train at the
          station before West Lynne, and dropped into a
          roadside public-house, as I walked, and got a good
          supper. Let me go, dear; I am all in a fever."</p>
  <p>Richard departed, reached that part of West Lynne where
          the Raven was situated, and was so far favoured by
          fortune that he had not long to wait. Scarcely had
          he taken up his lounge outside, when two gentlemen
          came from it, arm-in-arm. Being the headquarters of
          one of the candidates, the idlers of the place
          thought they could not do better than make it their
          head-quarters also, and the road and pavement were
          never free from loitering starers and gossipers.
          Richard Hare, his hat well over his eyes, and his
          black ringlets made the most of, only added one to
          the rest.</p>
  <p>Two gentlemen came forth arm-in-arm. The loiterers raised
          a feeble shout of "Levison for ever!" Richard did
          not join in the shout, but his pulses were beating,
          and his heart leaped up within him. The one was
          Thorn; the other the gentleman he had seen with
          Thorn in London, pointed out to him—as he had
          believed— as Sir Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>"Which of those two is Levison?" he inquired of a man,
          near whom he stood.</p>
  <p>"Don't you know! Him with the hat off, bowing his thanks
          to us, is Levison."</p>
  <p>No need to inquire further. It was the Thorn of <pb n="123"/> Richard's memory. His ungloved hand,
          raised to his hat, was white as ever; more sparkling
          than ever, as it flashed in the gas-light, was the
          diamond ring. By the hand and ring alone, Richard
          could have sworn to the man, had it been
          needful.</p>
  <p>"Who is the other one?" he continued.</p>
  <p>"Some gent as come down from London with him. His name's
          Drake. Be you yellow, sailor? or be you
          scarlet-and-purple?"</p>
  <p>"I am neither. I am only a stranger, passing through the
          town."</p>
  <p>"On the tramp?"</p>
  <p>"Tramp!—no." And Richard moved away, to make the best of
          his progress to East Lynne, and report to Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>Now it happened, on that windy night, that Lady Isabel,
          her mind disordered, her brow fevered with its
          weight of care, stole out into the grounds, after
          the children had left her for the night; courting
          the boisterous gusts, courting any discomfort she
          might meet. As if they could, even for a moment,
          cool the fire within! To the solitude of this very
          covered walk bent she her steps; and, not long had
          she paced it, when she descried some man advancing,
          in the garb of a sailor. Not caring to be seen, she
          turned short off amidst the trees, intending to
          emerge again when he had passed. She wondered who he
          was, and what brought him there.</p>
  <p>But he did not pass. He lingered in the walk, keeping her
          a prisoner. A minute more, and she saw him joined by
          Mrs. Carlyle. They met with a loving embrace.</p>
  <p>Embrace a strange man! Mrs. Carlyle! All the <pb n="124"/> blood in Lady Isabel's body rushed to her brain.
          Was she, his second wife, false to him?—more
          shamelessly false than even herself had been,
          inasmuch as she had the grace to quit him and East
          Lynne before, as the servant girls say when they
          change their sweethearts, "taking up" with another.
          The positive conviction that such was the case
          seized firm hold upon her fancy: her thoughts were
          in a tumult, her mind was a chaos. Was there any
          small corner of rejoicing in her heart that it was
          so? And yet—what was it to her? It could not alter
          by one iota her own position: it could not restore
          to her the love she had forfeited.</p>
  <p>Coupled lovingly together, they were now sauntering up
          the walk, the sailor's arm thrown round the waist of
          Mrs. Carlyle. "Oh! the shameless woman!" Ay; she
          could be bitter enough upon graceless doings when
          enacted by another.</p>
  <p>But, what was her astonishment when she saw Mr. Carlyle
          advance, and that it caused not the slightest change
          in their gracelessness, for the sailor's arm was not
          withdrawn. Two or three minutes they stood, the
          three, talking together in a group. Then, good
          nights were exchanged, the sailor left them, and Mr.
          Carlyle, his own arm lovingly pressed where the
          other's had been, withdrew with his wife. The
          truth—that it was Barbara's brother—flashed to the
          mind of Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Was I mad?" she cried, with a hollow laugh. "
            <hi>She</hi> false to him! No, no: that fate was
          reserved for me alone."</p>
  <p>She followed them to the house; she glanced in at the
          windows of the drawing-room. Lights and fire were in
          the room, but the curtains and windows were not <pb n="125"/> closed for the night, for it was through
          those windows that Mr. Carlyle and his wife had
          passed in and out, on their visits to the covered
          walk. There they were, alone in their happiness, and
          she stopped to glance in upon it. Lord Mount Severn
          had departed for London, to be down again early in
          the week. The tea was on the table, but Barbara had
          not begun to make it. She sat on the sofa by the
          fire, her face, with its ever-loving gaze upon it,
          turned up to her husband's. He stood near, was
          talking with apparent earnestness, and looking down
          at Barbara. Another moment, and a smile crossed his
          lips, the same sweet smile so often bent upon
            <hi>her</hi> in the bygone days. Yes, they were
          together in their unclouded happiness; and she—she
          turned away towards her own lonely sitting-room,
          sick and faint at heart.</p>
  <p>Ball and Treadman—as the brass plate on their
          office-doors intimated—were conveyancers and
          attorneys-at-law. Mr. Treadman, who attended chiefly
          to the conveyancing, lived at the office with his
          family; Mr. Ball, a bachelor, lived away; Lawyer
          Ball, West Lynne styled him. Not a young bachelor;
          midway, he may have been, between forty and fifty. A
          short, stout man, with a keen face and green eyes.
          He took up any practice that was brought to him,
          dirty odds and ends that Mr. Carlyle would not have
          touched with his toe: but, as that gentleman had
          remarked, he could be honest and true upon
          occasions, and there was no doubt that he would be
          so to Richard Hare. To his house, on Monday morning
          early, so as to catch him before he went out,
          proceeded Mr. Carlyle. A high respect for Mr.
          Carlyle had Lawyer Ball, as he had had for his
          father before him: many a good turn had the Carlyles
          done him, if only helping him and his partner to
          clients, <pb n="126"/> whom they were too fastidious
          to take up. But the two, Mr. Carlyle and Lawyer
          Ball, did not rank alike, though their profession
          was the same: Lawyer Ball knew that they did not,
          and was content to feel humble. The one was a
          received gentleman; the other was a country
          attorney.</p>
  <p>Lawyer Ball was at breakfast when Mr. Carlyle was shown
          in.</p>
  <p>"Halloa, Carlyle! You are here betimes."</p>
  <p>"Sit still: don't disturb yourself. Don't ring: I have
          breakfasted."</p>
  <p>"The most delicious pâté de foie," urged Lawyer Ball, who
          was a regular gourmand. "I get 'em direct from
          Strasburg."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle resisted the offered dainty, with a smile. "I
          have come on business," said he; "not to feast.
          Before I enter upon it, you will give me your word,
          Ball, that my communication shall be held sacred, in
          the event of your not consenting to pursue it
          further."</p>
  <p>"Certainly I will. What business is it? Some that offends
          the delicacy of the Carlyle office?" he added, with
          a laugh. "A would-be client, whom you turn over to
          me, in your exclusiveness?"</p>
  <p>"It is a client for whom I cannot act. But not from the
          motives you assume. It concerns that affair of
          Hallijohn's," Mr. Carlyle continued, bending forward
          and somewhat dropping his voice. "The murder."</p>
  <p>Lawyer Ball, who had just taken in a delicious bonne
          bouchée of the foie gras, bolted it whole in his
          surprise. "Why! that was enacted ages and ages ago!
          it is past and done with," he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"Not done with," said Mr. Carlyle. "Circumstances have
          come to light, which tend to indicate that Richard
            <pb n="127"/> Hare was innocent: that it was
          another who committed the murder."</p>
  <p>"In conjunction with him?" interrupted the attorney.</p>
  <p>"No: alone. Richard Hare had nothing whatever to do with
          it. He was not present at the time."</p>
  <p>"Do you believe that?" asked Lawyer Ball.</p>
  <p>"I have believed it for years."</p>
  <p>"Then who did commit that murder?"</p>
  <p>"Richard accuses one of the name of Thorn. Several years
          back, I had a meeting with Richard Hare, and he
          disclosed certain facts to me, which, if correct,
          could not fail to prove that he was innocent. Since
          that period, this impression has been gradually
          confirmed, by little and by little, trifle upon
          trifle; and I would now stake my life upon his
          innocence. I should long ago have moved in the
          matter, hit or miss, could I have lighted upon
          Thorn, but he was not to be found, nor any clue to
          him, and we now know that this name, Thorn, was an
          assumed one."</p>
  <p>"Is he to be found?"</p>
  <p>"He is found. He is at West Lynne. Mark you, I don't
          accuse him: I do not offer an opinion upon his
          guilt: I only state my belief in Richard's
          innocence: it may have been another who did it,
          neither Richard nor Thorn. It was my firm intention
          to take Richard's cause up the instant I saw my way
          clearly in it: and now that that time has come, I am
          debarred from doing so."</p>
  <p>"What debars you?" asked Lawyer Ball.</p>
  <p>"Hence I come to you," continued Mr. Carlyle,
          disregarding the question. "I come on the part of
          Richard Hare. I have seen him lately, and conversed
            <pb n="128"/> with him. I gave him my reasons for
          not personally acting, advised him to apply to you,
          and promised to come here and open the matter. Will
          you see Richard, in good faith, and hear his
          story?—giving the understanding that he shall depart
          in secret and unmolested, as he came, if you do not
          decide to undertake the business."</p>
  <p>"I'll give it with all the pleasure in life," freely
          returned the attorney. "I'm sure I don't want to
          harm poor Dick Hare. And if he can convince me of
          his innocence, I'll do my best to establish it."</p>
  <p>"Of his own tale you must be the judge. I do not wish to
          bias you. I have stated my belief in his innocence,
          but I repeat that I give no opinion, myself, as to
          who else may be guilty. Hear his account, and then
          take up the affair, or not, as you may think fit. He
          would not come to you without your previous promise
          to hold him harmless; to be his friend, in short,
          for the time being: when I bear this promise to him
          from you, my part is done."</p>
  <p>"I give it you in all honour, Carlyle. Tell Dick he has
          nothing to fear from me. Quite the contrary; for if
          I can befriend him I shall be glad to do it, and I
          won't spare trouble. What can possibly be your
          objection to act for him?"</p>
  <p>"My objection applies not to Richard: I would willingly
          appear for him; but I will not take proceedings
          against the man he accuses. If that man is to be
          denounced and brought before justice, I will hold
          neither act nor part in it."</p>
  <p>The words aroused the curiosity of Lawyer Ball, and he
          began to turn over all persons, likely and unlikely,
          in his mind: never, according to usage, giving a <pb n="129"/> suspicion to the right one. "I cannot
          fathom you, Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"You will do that better, possibly, when Richard shall
          have made his disclosure."</p>
  <p>"It's—it's—never his own father that he accuses? Justice
          Hare?"</p>
  <p>"Your wits must be wool-gathering, Ball."</p>
  <p>"Well, so they must, to give utterance to so preposterous
          a notion," acquiesced the attorney, pushing back his
          chair, and throwing his breakfast napkin on the
          carpet. "But I don't know a soul you could object to
          go against, except the justice. What's anybody else,
          in West Lynne, to you, in comparison with restoring
          Dick Hare to his fair fame? I give it up."</p>
  <p>"So do I for the present," said Mr. Carlyle, as he rose.
          "And now, about the ways and means for your meeting
          this poor fellow? Where can you see him?"</p>
  <p>"Is he at West Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"No. But I can get a message conveyed to him, and he
          could come."</p>
  <p>"When?"</p>
  <p>"To-night, if you liked."</p>
  <p>"Then let him come here, to this house. He will be
          perfectly safe."</p>
  <p>"So be it. My part is now over," concluded Mr. Carlyle.
          And with a few more preliminary words, he departed.
          Lawyer Ball looked after him.</p>
  <p>"It's a queer business. One would think Dick accuses some
          old flame of Carlyle's: some demoiselle or dame he
          daren't go against."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XII. AN APPLICATION TO THE BENCH.</head>
  <p><hi>On</hi> Monday evening the interview between Lawyer
          Ball and Richard Hare took place. With some
          difficulty would the lawyer believe his tale: not as
          to its broad details; he saw that he might give
          credit to them: but as to the accusation against Sir
          Francis Levison. Richard persisted: mentioning every
          minute particular he could think of: his meeting him
          the night of the elopement in Bean-lane; his
          meetings with him again in London, and Sir Francis's
          evident fear of him; and the previous Saturday
          night's recognition at the door of the Raven. Not
          forgetting to tell of the anonymous letter received
          by Justice Hare, the morning that Richard was in
          hiding at Mr. Carlyle's. There was no doubt in the
          world it had been sent by Francis Levison to
          frighten Mr. Hare into despatching him out of West
          Lynne, had Richard taken refuge in his father's
          house. None had more cause to keep Dick from falling
          into the hands of justice, than Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>"I believe what you say, I believe all you say, Mr.
          Richard, touching Thorn," debated the attorney, "but
          it's next to impossible to take in so astounding a
          fact, as that he is Sir Francis Levison."</p>
  <p>"You can satisfy yourself of the fact from other lips <pb n="131"/> than mine," said Richard. "Otway Bethel
          could testify to it if he would: though I doubt his
          willingness. But there's Ebenezer James."</p>
  <p>"What does he know about it?" asked the attorney, in
          surprise. "Ebenezer James is in our office at
          present."</p>
  <p>"He saw Thorn often enough in those days, and has, I
          hear, recognised him as Levison. You had better
          inquire of him. Should you object to take cause
          against Levison?"</p>
  <p>"Not a bit of it. Let me be assured that I am upon safe
          grounds, as to the identity of the man, and I'll
          proceed in it forthwith. Levison is an out-and-out
          scoundrel, <hi>as</hi> Levison, and deserves
          hanging. I will send for James at once, and hear
          what he says," he concluded after a pause of
          consideration.</p>
  <p>Richard Hare started wildly up. "Not while I am here: he
          must not see me. For Heaven's sake, consider the
          peril to me, Mr. Ball!"</p>
  <p>"Pooh, pooh!" laughed the attorney. "Do you suppose I
          have but this one reception-room? We don't let cats
          into cages where canary-birds are kept."</p>
  <p>Ebenezer James returned with the messenger despatched
          after him. "You'll be sure to find him at the
          singing saloon," Mr. Ball had said; and there the
          gentleman was found.</p>
  <p>"Is it any copying, sir, wanted to be done in a hurry?"
          cried James, as he came in.</p>
  <p>"No," replied the attorney. "I wish a question or two
          answered; that's all. Did you ever know Sir Francis
          Levison to go by any name but his own?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir, he has gone by the name of Thorn."</p>
  <p>A pause "When was this?"</p>
  <pb n="132"/>
  <p>"It was the autumn when Hallijohn was killed. Thorn used
          to be prowling about there in an evening: in the
          wood and at the cottage, I mean."</p>
  <p>"What did he prowl for?"</p>
  <p>Ebenezer James laughed. "For the same reason that several
          more did. I, for one. He was sweet upon Afy
          Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>"Where was he living at the time? I never remember him in
          West Lynne."</p>
  <p>"He was not at West Lynne, sir. On the contrary, he
          seemed to take precious good care that West Lynne
          and he kept separate. A splendid horse he rode,
          thorough-bred, and he used to come galloping into
          the wood at dusk, get over his chat with Miss Afy,
          mount, and gallop away again."</p>
  <p>"Where to? Where did he come from?"</p>
  <p>From somewhere near Swainson: a ten miles' ride, Afy used
          to say he had. Now that he has appeared here in his
          own plumage, of course I can put two and two
          together, and not be at much fault for the exact
          spot."</p>
  <p>"And where's that?" asked the lawyer.</p>
  <p>"Levison Park," said Mr. Ebenezer. "There's little doubt
          he was stopping at his uncle's; and you know that is
          close to Swainson."</p>
  <p>Lawyer Ball thought things were becoming clearer —or
          darker, whichever you may please to call it. He
          paused again, and then put a question
          impressively.</p>
  <p>"James, have you any doubt whatever, or shadow of doubt,
          that Sir Francis Levison is the same man you knew as
          Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Sir, have I any doubt that you are Mr. Ball, or that I
          am Eb. James?" retorted Mr. Ebenezer. <pb n="133"/>
          "I am as certain of that man's identity as I am of
          ours."</p>
  <p>"Are you ready to swear to the fact in a court of
          justice?"</p>
  <p>"Ready and willing; in any court in the world. To-morrow,
          if I am called upon."</p>
  <p>"Very well. You may go back to your singing club now.
          Keep a silent tongue in your head."</p>
  <p>"All close, sir," answered Mr. Ebenezer James.</p>
  <p>Far into the middle of the night sat Lawyer Ball and
          Richard Hare, the former chiefly occupied in taking
          notes of Richard's statement. "It's half a crotchet,
          this objection of Carlyle's to interfere with
          Levison!" said Richard, suddenly, in the midst of
          some desultory conversation. "Don't you think so,
          Mr. Ball?"</p>
  <p>The lawyer pursed up his lips. "Um—a delicate point.
          Carlyle was always fastidiously honourable.
            <hi>I</hi> should go at him, thunder and fury, in
          his place: but I and Carlyle are different."</p>
  <p>The following day, Tuesday, Mr. Ball was much occupied in
          putting, to use nearly Ebenezer James's words, that
          and that together. Later in the day, he took a
          journey to Levison Park, ferreted out some
          information, and came home again. In the evening of
          that same day, Richard departed for Liverpool; he
          was done with for the present: Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle
          being, as before, alone cognisant of his
          address.</p>
  <p>Wednesday morning witnessed the return of the Earl of
          Mount Severn. Lord Vane came also. The latter ought
          to have gone back to Eton, but he had teased and
          prayed to be allowed to "see the fun out," meaning
          the election. "And that devil's discomfiture when he
          finds himself beaten," he surreptitiously added, <pb n="134"/> behind his father's back, who was a
          great stickler for the boy's always being
          "gentlemanlike." So the earl had yielded. They
          arrived, as before, about breakfast-time, having
          travelled at night. Subsequently they and Mr.
          Carlyle walked into West Lynne together.</p>
  <p>West Lynne was alive and astir. The election was to come
          off that week, and people made it their business to
          be in a bustle over it, collectively and
          individually. Mr. Carlyle's committee sat at the
          Buck's Head, and the traffic in and out was enough
          to wear the stones away. The bench of justices were
          remarkably warm over it, neglecting the judicial
          business, and showing themselves at the Buck's Head
          windows in purple-and-scarlet streamers.</p>
  <p>"I will be with you in ten minutes," said Mr. Carlyle,
          withdrawing his arm from Lord Mount Severn's, as
          they approached his office, "but I must go in and
          read my letters."</p>
  <p>So the earl went on to the Buck's Head, and Lord Vane
          took a foot canter down to the Raven, to reconnoitre
          it outside. He was uncommonly fond of planting
          himself where Sir Francis Levison's eyes were sure
          to fall upon him; which eyes were immediately
          dropped, while the young gentleman's would be fixed
          in an audacious stare. Being Lord Vane—or, it may be
          more correct to say, being the Earl of Mount
          Severn's son, and under control—he was debarred from
          dancing and jeering after the yellow candidate, as
          the unwashed gentry of his own age indulged in, but
          his tongue and his feet itched to do it.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle took his seat in his private room, opened his
          letters, sorted them, marked on the back of some
          what was to be the purport of their answers, and
          then <pb n="135"/> called in Mr. Dill. Mr. Carlyle
          put the letters in his hand, gave some rapid
          instructions, and rose.</p>
  <p>"You are in a hurry, Mr. Archibald."</p>
  <p>"They want me at the Buck's Head. Why?"</p>
  <p>"A curious incident occurred to me last evening, sir. I
          overheard a dispute between Levison and Otway
          Bethel."</p>
  <p>"Indeed," carelessly replied Mr. Carlyle, who was busy at
          the time, looking for something in the deep drawer
          of his desk.</p>
  <p>"And what I heard would go far to hang Levison, if not
          Bethel. As sure as we are here, Mr. Archibald, they
          hold the secret of Hallijohn's murder. It appears
          that Levison—"</p>
  <p>"Stop," interposed Mr. Carlyle. "I would prefer not to
          hear this. Levison may have murdered him, but it is
          no affair of mine: neither shall I make it
          such."</p>
  <p>Old Dill felt checkmated. "Meanwhile, Richard Hare
          suffers, Mr. Archibald," he observed in a
          remonstrating tone.</p>
  <p>"I am aware he does."</p>
  <p>"Is it right that the innocent should suffer for the
          guilty?"</p>
  <p>"No. Very wrong. But the case is all too common."</p>
  <p>"If some one would take up Richard Hare's cause now, he
          might be proved innocent," added the old man, with a
          wistful look at Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It is being taken up, Dill."</p>
  <p>A pause and a glad look. "That's the best news I have had
          for many a day, sir. But my evidence will be
          necessary to the case. Levison—"</p>
  <p>"I am not taking up the case. You must carry <pb n="136"/> your news elsewhere. It is no affair of mine, I
          say."</p>
  <p>"Then who is taking it up?" echoed Mr. Dill, in
          astonishment.</p>
  <p>"Ball. He has had a meeting with Richard, and is now
          acting for him."</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill's eyes sparkled. "Is he going to prosecute, Mr.
          Archibald?"</p>
  <p>"I tell you I know nothing. I will know nothing."</p>
  <p>"Ah well! I can understand. But I shall go on to their
          office at once, Mr. Archibald, and inform them of
          what I overheard," said old Dill, in vehement
          decision.</p>
  <p>"That is not my affair, either," laughed Mr. Carlyle; "it
          is yours. But remember—if you do go—it is Ball, not
          Treadman."</p>
  <p>Waiting only to give certain orders to the head clerk,
          Mr. Dill proceeded to the office of Ball and
          Treadman. A full hour was he closeted there with the
          senior partner.</p>
  <p>Not until three o'clock that afternoon did the justices
          take their seats on the bench. Like renegade
          school-boys, they had been playing truant,
          conjugating the verb <hi>s'amuser</hi> , instead of
            <hi>travailler</hi> , and now scuffled in to their
          duties at the tenth hour. It was scarcely to be
          called coming in, either, for there were but two of
          them, one slinking in after the other, with
          conscious faces of neglect: Justice Herbert and
          Squire Pinner.</p>
  <p>Two important cases were disposed of, both arising out of
          the present rollicking state of West Lynne. Two
          ladies, one declaring for the purple-and-scarlet,
          the other for the yellow, had disputed in a
          public-house over the merits of the respective
          candidates, winding it up with a pewter-pot fight.
          The second case was that of a knot <pb n="137"/> of
          boys, who had carried Sir Francis Levison (in straw)
          through the town, and then burnt him on a convenient
          grass-plot. To the exceeding terror of the
          grass-plot's owners, and destruction of certain
          linen of theirs, which, lying out there to dry, got
          burnt. The two ladies were condemned to a week's
          imprisonment; and the boys were ordered the treat of
          a private whipping.</p>
  <p>Scarcely had the latter case been disposed of, and the
          boys removed, all howling, when Lawyer Ball bustled
          in and craved a secret hearing. His application was
          of the last importance, he premised, but, that the
          ends of justice might not be defeated, it was
          necessary their worships should entertain it in
          private; he therefore craved the bench to accord it
          to him.</p>
  <p>The bench consulted, looked wise, and—possibly possessing
          some latent curiosity themselves upon the
          point—graciously acceded. They adjourned to a
          private room, and it was half-past four, before they
          came out of it. Very long faces, scared and grim,
          wore their worships, as if Lawyer Ball's
          communication had both perplexed and confounded
          them.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIII. THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.</head>
  <p>" <hi>This</hi> is the afternoon we are to meet Dr.
          Martin at papa's office," William Carlyle had
          exclaimed that same day at dinner. "Do we walk in,
          Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>"I do not know, William. Mrs. Carlyle is going to take
          you."</p>
  <p>"No, she is not. You are to take me."</p>
  <p>A flush passed over Lady Isabel's face at the bare
          thought: though she did not believe it. <hi>She</hi>
          go to Mr. Carlyle's office! "Mrs. Carlyle told me
          herself that she should take you," was her
          reply.</p>
  <p>"All I know is, that mamma said this morning you would
          take me in to West Lynne to-day," persisted
          William.</p>
  <p>The discussion was interrupted by the appearance of Mrs.
          Carlyle: interrupted and decided also. "Madame
          Vine," she said, "you will be ready at three o'clock
          to go in with William."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel's heart beat. "I understood you to say that
          you should go with him yourself, madam."</p>
  <p>"I know I did. I intended to do so. But I heard this
          morning that some friends from a distance are coming
          this afternoon to call upon me. Therefore I shall
          not go out."</p>
  <pb n="139"/>
  <p>How she, Lady Isabel, wished that she dared say also, "I
          shall not go out, either." But that might not be.
          Well? she must go through with it, as she had to go
          through with the rest.</p>
  <p>William rode his pony into West Lynne, the groom
          attending to take it back again. He was to walk home
          with Madame Vine: who walked both ways.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was not in, when they arrived at the office.
          The boy went boldly on to the private room, leaving
          Madame Vine to follow him. Mr. Dill came in.</p>
  <p>"Well, Master William! Have you come here to give
          instructions in a lawsuit, or to file a bill in
          Chancery?" laughed he. "Take a seat, pray
          ma'am."</p>
  <p>"I have come here to wait for Dr. Martin. He's coming to
          see me. I say, Mr. Dill, where's papa gone?"</p>
  <p>"How should I know?" said Mr. Dill, pleasantly. "But now,
          what do you want with Dr. Martin? I am sure you must
          be getting better—with that rosy colour!"</p>
  <p>"I wish I could get better!" responded the boy. "It's so
          nasty, having that cod-liver oil to take! Mamma was
          coming in with me, but she can't now."</p>
  <p>"How is your mamma, Master William?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, she's very well. What a shouting there was, down by
          the police station! It frightened my pony, and I had
          to hold him in, and give him a little taste of whip.
          They were kicking a yellow rosette about."</p>
  <p>"Ah. There'll be no peace till this election's over,"
          responded old Dill. "I wish it was: and the fellow
          clear of the town."</p>
  <p>"Do you mean that Levison?" asked William, who <pb n="140"/> of course took his tone of politics from
          those around him.</p>
  <p>"Yes, I do. The extraordinary thing is," he continued,
          speaking to himself and not to his auditors, "what
          could have possessed the fool to venture here."</p>
  <p>A hot glow illumined the face of Lady Isabel. What
          possessed "the fool" to do many things that he had
          done? A fool, in the extreme sense of the term, he
          verily and indeed was.</p>
  <p>"Of course he could not expect to stand against my papa!"
          oracularly spoke William.</p>
  <p>"He'll never stand against any good man," warmly returned
          old Dill. "No: God would never suffer it."</p>
  <p>"Do you mean for the election?" quoth William.</p>
  <p>"No, my dear. I was not thinking of elections just
          then."</p>
  <p>A clerk appeared, showing in a stranger: a client. The
          clerk might have deemed that Mr. Carlyle was in his
          room. Old Dill took the client out again, into his
          own little private sanctum: but not before the
          governess had been honoured with a curious
          stare.</p>
  <p>She was dressed as she ever was, in black silk. Sometimes
          her dresses were rich, sometimes plain and quiet;
          but the material was invariably the same: black
          silk. As, in doors, the make of the upper part was
          the same—the loose jacket. The one she wore to-day
          was a handsome robe with embossed flounces; a mantle
          to match. And there was the large straw bonnet, with
          its hiding veil. The old blue spectacles were home
          again, and on. Lady Isabel wished herself anywhere
          else: she did not like that strange eyes should look
          upon her.</p>
  <pb n="141"/>
  <p>Presently Mr. Carlyle appeared. He was talking to Mr.
          Dill, who followed him.</p>
  <p>"Oh—are you here, Madame Vine! I left word that you were
          to go in to Miss Carlyle's. Did I not leave word,
          Dill?"</p>
  <p>"Not with me, sir."</p>
  <p>"I forgot it then. I meant to do so. What is the time?"
          He looked at his watch. Ten minutes to four. "Did
          the doctor say at what hour he should call?" Mr.
          Carlyle added to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"Not precisely. I gathered that it would not be very
          early in the afternoon."</p>
  <p>They went in to Miss Carlyle's, Lady Isabel and William.
          That lady was out. Not expected in till dinner-time,
          the man said. William took up a comfortable position
          on the sofa, and, remaining quiet, dropped
          asleep.</p>
  <p>How slowly the minutes seemed to flit past! how still the
          house seemed to be! You may have noticed that,
          yourselves, when waiting long for anything. Lady
          Isabel sat on, listening to the silence;
          mechanically watching the passers-by through the
          Venetian blind; glancing at the child's white
          face—white now; wishing the physician would come. It
          struck half-past five.</p>
  <p>"Here he is!" she thought. An entrance at the hall door:
          and now advancing footsteps. Not physician's
          footsteps. Her heart would not have fluttered at
          them.</p>
  <p>"Dr. Martin is late," observed Mr. Carlyle, as he came
          in. "I fear your patience will be tired, Madame
          Vine."</p>
  <p>"It is of no consequence, sir," she replied, in that <pb n="142"/> indistinct, whispered tone, above which
          her voice was scarcely, if ever, raised.</p>
  <p>"How pale he looks!" involuntarily exclaimed Mr. Carlyle,
          glancing from Madame Vine to the boy. "And this
          inclination to sleep! Is it good, I wonder?"</p>
  <p>"I thought that Mrs. Carlyle would come in with him,"
          said Madame, at a loss for something to say.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Carlyle is expecting friends. And I do not know
          that she would have come, had she not been. She has
          not felt very well the last day or two, and I could
          not allow her to be fatigued, in her present state
          of health."</p>
  <p>A sharp pang. The time had been when it was she—
            <hi>she</hi> —whom he would not allow fatigue to
          touch. Oh! to be his, once more; his, with the past
          blotted out.</p>
  <p>"Here he is!" exclaimed Mr. Carlyle with alacrity, as he
          went into the hall. She supposed he alluded to the
          physician; supposed he had seen him pass the window.
          Their entrance together woke up William.</p>
  <p>"Well," said the doctor, who was a little man with a bald
          head, "and how fares it with my young patient? Bon
          jour, madame."</p>
  <p>"Bon jour, monsieur," responded she. She wished everybody
          would address her in French, and take her for
          French; there seemed less chance of recognition. She
          would have to speak in good plain English, however,
          if she must carry on a conversation with the doctor.
          Beyond a familiar phrase or two, he was something
          like Justice Hare—Nong parley Frongsay, me!</p>
  <p>"And how does the cod-liver oil get on?" asked <pb n="143"/> the doctor of William, as he drew him to
          the light. "It is nicer now than it used to be,
          eh?"</p>
  <p>"No," said William, "it's nastier than ever."</p>
  <p>Dr. Martin looked at the boy: felt his pulse, his skin,
          listened to his breathing. "There," said he,
          presently, "you may sit down again and have your nap
          out."</p>
  <p>"I wish I might have something to drink: I am very
          thirsty. May I ring for some water, papa?"</p>
  <p>"Go and find your aunt's maid, and ask her for some,"
          said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Ask her for milk," called out Dr. Martin. "Not
          water."</p>
  <p>Away went William. Mr. Carlyle was leaning against the
          side of the window; Dr. Martin folded his arms
          before it; Lady Isabel stood near the latter. The
          broad, full light was cast upon all, but the thick
          veil hid Lady Isabel's face. It was not often she
          could be caught without that veil, for she seemed to
          wear her bonnet at all sorts of seasonable and
          unseasonable times.</p>
  <p>"What is your opinion, doctor?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Well," began the doctor, in a <hi>very</hi> professional
          tone, "the boy is certainly delicate. But—"</p>
  <p>"Stay, Dr. Martin," was the interruption, spoken in a
          low, impressive voice, "you will deal candidly with
          me. I must know the truth, without disguise. Tell it
          me freely."</p>
  <p>Dr. Martin paused. "The truth is not always palatable,
          Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"True. But, for that very reason, all the more necessary.
            <pb n="144"/> Let me hear the worst. And the child
          has no mother, you know, to be shocked with it."</p>
  <p>"I fear that it will be the worst."</p>
  <p>"Death?"</p>
  <p>"Ay. The seeds of consumption must have been inherent in
          him. They are showing themselves all too
          plainly."</p>
  <p>What Mr. Carlyle felt was not suffered to appear: his
          feelings were entirely under his own control. That
          he was tenderly and sincerely attached to his
          children, there was no doubt. He remained quite
          still, his eyes shaded by their drooping lids. A few
          minutes, and he broke the silence.</p>
  <p>"How can consumption have come to <hi>him?</hi> It is not
          in the family: on my side, or—or on his
          mother's."</p>
  <p>"Pardon me," said the doctor. "The child's grandmother
          died of consumption; the Countess of Mount
          Severn."</p>
  <p>"They did not call it consumption," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I don't care what they called it. It was consumption.
          Very slow and lingering; mild, too; I grant you
          that."</p>
  <p>"Is there <hi>no</hi> hope for the child?"</p>
  <p>Dr. Martin looked at him. "You bade me give you the
          truth."</p>
  <p>"Nothing else! nothing but the truth," returned Mr.
          Carlyle, his tone one of mingled pain and
          command.</p>
  <p>"Then, there is none: no hope whatever. The lungs are
          extensively diseased."</p>
  <p>"And how long—"</p>
  <p>"That I cannot say," interrupted the doctor, divining <pb n="145"/> what the next question was to be. "He
          may linger on for months; for a year, it may even
          be; or, a very short period may see the termination.
          Don't worry him with any more lessons and stuff of
          learning: he'll never want it."</p>
  <p>The doctor cast his eyes upon the governess as he spoke;
          the injunction concerning her as much as it did Mr.
          Carlyle. And the doctor started, for he thought she
          was fainting; her face had become so ghastly white:
          he could see it through her veil.</p>
  <p>"You are ill, madame! you are ill! Trouve malade! don't
          you?"</p>
  <p>She opened her lips to speak; her trembling lips, that
          would not obey her. Dr. Martin, in his concern,
          pulled off the blue spectacles. She caught them from
          him with one hand, sat down on the nearest chair,
          and hid her face with the other.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, scarcely understanding the scuffle, came
          forward. "Are you ill, Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>She was putting on her spectacles under her veil, her
          face whiter than ever. "Pray do not interrupt your
          conversation to pay attention to me! I think you; I
          thank you both. I am subject to—slight spasms, and
          they make me look ill for the moment. It has passed
          now."</p>
  <p>The doctor turned from her: Mr. Carlyle resumed his place
          by the window. "What should be the treatment?" asked
          the latter.</p>
  <p>"Almost anything you please—that the boy himself likes.
          Let him play, or rest; ride, or walk; eat and drink,
          or let it alone: it cannot make much
          difference."</p>
  <pb n="146"/>
  <p>"Doctor! You yield to it, as a last hope, very
          lightly."</p>
  <p>Dr. Martin shook his head. "I speak as I <hi>know</hi> .
          You insisted on having my true opinion."</p>
  <p>"A warmer climate?" suggested Mr. Carlyle, eagerly, the
          idea crossing his mind.</p>
  <p>"It might prolong the end for a very little while: a few
          weeks, perhaps: avert it, it could not. And who
          could take him? You could not go; and he has no
          mother. No: I should not advise it."</p>
  <p>"I wish you would see Wainwright—with reference to
          William."</p>
  <p>"I have seen him. I met him this afternoon, by chance,
          and told him my opinion. How is Mrs. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"Pretty well. She is not in robust health, you are aware,
          just now."</p>
  <p>Dr. Martin smiled. "These things will happen. Mrs.
          Carlyle has a thoroughly good constiution: a far
          stronger one than—than—"</p>
  <p>"Than what?" said Mr. Carlyle, wondering why he
          hesitated.</p>
  <p>"You must grant me pardon. I may as well finish, now I
          have begun; but I was not thinking, when I spoke.
          She is stronger than was Lady Isabel. I must be off
          to catch the six train."</p>
  <p>"You will come over from time to time to East Lynne, to
          see William?"</p>
  <p>"If you wish it. It may be a satisfaction, perhaps. Bon
          jour, madame."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel bowed to him as he left the room with Mr.
          Carlyle. "How fond that French governess of yours is
          of the boy!" the doctor whispered, as they <pb n="147"/> crossed the hall. "I detected it when
          she brought him to Lynneborough. And you saw her
          just now! that emotion was all because I said he
          could not live. Good bye."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle grasped his hand. "Doctor, I <hi>wish</hi>
          you could save him!" he passionately uttered.</p>
  <p>"Ah, Carlyle! if we humble mites of human doctors could
          but keep those whom it is the Great Physician's good
          pleasure to take, how we should be run after!
          There's hidden mercy, remember, in the darkest
          cloud. Farewell, my friend."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle returned to the room. He approached Lady
          Isabel, looking down upon her as she sat: not that
          he could see much of her face. "These are grievous
          tidings. But you were more prepared for them, I
          fancy, than I was."</p>
  <p>She started suddenly up, approached the window, and
          looked out; as if she saw somebody passing whom she
          would gaze at. All of emotion was stirred up within
          her; her temples throbbed, her throat beat, her
          breath became hysterical. Could she bear thus to
          hold confidential converse with him, over the state
          of their child? She pulled off her gloves for
          coolness to her burning hands, she wiped the
          moisture from her pale forehead, she struggled for
          calmness. What excuse could she offer to Mr.
          Carlyle?</p>
  <p>"I love the boy so very much, sir," she said, half
          turning round. "And the doctor's fiat, too plainly
          pronounced, has given me pain; pain to
          agitation."</p>
  <p>Again Mr. Carlyle approached her, following close up to
          where she stood. "You are very kind, thus to feel an
          interest in my child."</p>
  <pb n="148"/>
  <p>She did not answer.</p>
  <p>"Do not acquaint Mrs. Carlyle," he resumed. "I would
          prefer to tell her myself. She must not be suddenly
          grieved or alarmed just now."</p>
  <p>"Why should she be either grieved or alarmed? She is not
          his mother." Passionately, fiercely, resentfully
          were the words spoken, as if she would cast contempt
          to Barbara. But recollection returned to her before
          they had all left her lips, and the concluding
          sentence was wonderfully toned down. Mr. Carlyle
          raised his eyelids, and the tones of his voice rang
          haughtily on her ear.</p>
  <p>"You speak hastily, madame."</p>
  <p>The reproof eat into her heart, and she remembered who
          she was; remembered it with shame and humiliation.
          She, the governess! Mr. Carlyle must have deemed her
          worse than mad, so to speak of his wife. He was
          moving from her, when she suddenly turned to him, a
          yearning petition on her lips.</p>
  <p>"It appeared—if I understood aright—that there might be a
          difficulty about William's going to a warmer
          climate, no one, suitable, being at hand to take
          him. Sir! let me do it. Confide him to my
          charge."</p>
  <p>"Only for a few weeks," she said. "But are not those of
          value?"</p>
  <p>"That it <hi>might</hi> . Where would be the use? They
          would be weeks of isolation from his family. No,
          Madame Vine. If my boy is to leave me, I must have
          him with me to the last."</p>
  <p>William's head appeared, pushed in at the door to
          reconnoitre. "He's gone, isn't he? I would not <pb n="149"/> come back while he was here, for fear he
          should give me some cod-liver oil now."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle sat down and lifted William on his knees, his
          forehead pressed lovingly against the boy's silky
          hair. "My darling child, the cod-liver oil is to do
          you good, you know; to make you strong."</p>
  <p>"But I don't think it <hi>does</hi> make me strong, papa.
          Does Dr. Martin say I shall die?"</p>
  <p>"Who told you anything about dying?"</p>
  <p>"Oh—some of them talk of it."</p>
  <p>"We must see what we can do towards curing you, instead
          of letting you die," responded Mr. Carlyle, almost
          at a loss what answer to make, and suppressing the
          emotion of his own aching heart. "But, whether we
          live or die, we are in the hands of God: you know
          that, William: and, whatever God wills is always for
          the best."</p>
  <p>"Yes, I know that, papa."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle rose and lifted the boy towards Madame Vine.
          "Take care of him, madame," he said, and passed into
          the hall.</p>
  <p>"Here, papa, papa! I want you," cried William, breaking
          from Madame Vine's hand and running after him. "Let
          me walk home with you? Are you going to walk?"</p>
  <p>How could he find in his heart to deny anything to the
          child then? "Very well," he said. "Stay here till I
          come for you."</p>
  <p>"We are going home with papa," proclaimed William to
          Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>Madame Vine did not relish the news. But there was no
          help for it. In a very short time Mr. Carlyle
          appeared, and they set off: he holding William's
          hand; <pb n="150"/> Madame Vine walking alone, on
          the other side the child.</p>
  <p>"Where's William Vane, papa?" asked the boy.</p>
  <p>"He has gone on with Lord Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>Scarcely had the words been spoken, when some one came
          bolting out of the post-office, and met them face to
          face: almost ran against them, in fact, creating
          some hindrance. The man looked confused, and slunk
          off into the gutter. And you will not wonder that he
          did, when you hear that it was Francis Levison.
          William, child-like, turned his head to gaze at the
          intruder.</p>
  <p>"I would not be an ugly, bad man, like him, for the
          world," quoth he, as he turned it back again. "Would
          you, papa?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle did not answer, and she cast an involuntary
          glance upon him from her white face. His was
          impassive: save that a curl of ineffable scorn was
          upon his lips.</p>
  <p>At Mr. Justice Hare's gate they encountered that
          gentleman, who appeared to be standing there to give
          himself an airing. William caught sight of Mrs. Hare
          seated on the garden bench, outside the window, and
          ran to kiss her. All children loved Mrs. Hare. The
          justice was looking—not pale; that would not be a
          term half strong enough; but yellow. The curls of
          his best wig were limp, and all his pomposity
          appeared to have gone out of him.</p>
  <p>"I say, Carlyle, what on earth is this?" cried he, in a
          tone that, for him, was wonderfully subdued and
          meek. "I was not on the bench this afternoon, but
          Pinner has been telling me of—of—an application that
          was made to them in private. It's not true, you
          know; <pb n="151"/> it can't be; it's too
          far-fetched a tale. What do you know about it?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing," said Mr. Carlyle. "I have been privy to no
          application."</p>
  <p>"It seems they want to make out now that Dick never
          murdered Hallijohn," proceeded the justice, in a
          half whisper, glancing round as if to be sure that
          there were no eavesdroppers amidst the trees.</p>
  <p>"Oh," said Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"But that Levison did. <hi>Levison!</hi> "</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle made no reply, save by a gesture: his face
          more impassive than before. Not so another face
          beside him.</p>
  <p>"But it <hi>can't</hi> be, you know. It can't, I
          say."</p>
  <p>"So far as Richard's innocence goes, of that I have long
          been convinced," spoke Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"And that Levison's guilty?" returned the justice,
          opening his eyes in puzzled wonderment.</p>
  <p>"I give no opinion upon that point," was the cold
          rejoinder.</p>
  <p>"It's impossible, I say. Dick can't be innocent. You may
          as well tell me the world's turned upside down."</p>
  <p>"It is sometimes, I think. That Richard was not the
          guilty man will be proved yet, justice, in the broad
          face of day."</p>
  <p>"If—if—that other did do it, I should think you'd take
          the warrant out of the hands of the police, and
          capture him yourself."</p>
  <p>"I would not touch him with a pair of tongs," spoke Mr.
          Carlyle, his lip curling again. "If the man goes to
          his punishment, he goes; "but I do not help him on
          his road thither."</p>
  <pb n="152"/>
  <p>" <hi>Can</hi> Dick be innocent?" mused the justice,
          returning to the thought which so troubled his mind.
          "Then why has he kept away? Why did he not come back
          and say so?"</p>
  <p>"That you might deliver him up, justice? You know you
          took an oath to do it."</p>
  <p>The justice looked remarkably humble.</p>
  <p>"Oh, but, Carlyle," impulsively said he, the thought
          occurring to him, "what an awful revenge this would
          have been for you on—somebody—had she lived. How her
          false step would have come home to her now!"</p>
  <p>"False steps come home to most people," responded Mr.
          Carlyle, as he took William by the hand, who then
          ran up. And, lifting his hat to Mrs. Hare in the
          distance, he walked on.</p>
  <p>She, Lady Isabel, walked on too, by the side of the
          child, as before, walked on with a shivering frame,
          and a heart sick unto death. The justice looked
          after them, his mind preoccupied. He was in a maze
          of bewilderment. Richard innocent! Richard, whom he
          had striven to pursue to a shameful end! And that
          other the guilty one? The world <hi>was</hi> turning
          upside down.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIV. MISS CARLYLE IN FULL DRESS. AFY
          ALSO.</head>
  <p><hi>Merrily</hi> rose West Lynne on the Thursday morning;
          merrily rang out the bells, clashing and chiming.
          The street was alive with people; the windows were
          crowded with heads; something unusual was astir. It
          was the day of nomination of the two candidates, and
          everybody took the opportunity to make a
          holiday.</p>
  <p>Ten o'clock was the time named; but, before that hour
          struck, West Lynne was crammed. The county people
          had come in, thick and three-fold; rich and poor;
          people of note and people of none; voters and
          non-voters: all eager to mix themselves up in the
          day's proceedings. You see, the notorious fact of
          Sir Francis Levison's having come forward to oppose
          Mr. Carlyle, caused greater interest to attach to
          this election than is usual even in small country
          places—and that need not be. Barbara drove in to
          West Lynne, in her carriage; the two children with
          her, and the governess. The governess had wished to
          remain at home. Barbara would not hear of it; almost
          felt inclined to resent it as a slight: besides, if
          she took no interest in Mr. Carlyle, she must go to
          take care of Lucy: she, Barbara, would be too much
          occupied to look after children. So Madame Vine,
          perforce, stepped into the barouche <pb n="154"/>
          and sat opposite to Mrs. Carlyle, her thick veil
          shading her features, and their pallor contrasting
          with the blue spectacles.</p>
  <p>They alighted at the residence of Miss Carlyle. Quite a
          gathering was already there. Lady and Miss Dobede,
          the Herberts, Mrs. Hare, and many others; for the
          house was in a good spot for seeing the fun: and all
          people were eager to testify their respect for Mr.
          Carlyle. Miss Carlyle was in great grandeur; a
          brocaded dress, and a scarlet-and-purple bow in
          front of it, the size of a pumpkin. It was about the
          only occasion, in all Miss Carlyle's life, that she
          had deemed it necessary to attire herself
          magnificently. Barbara wore no bow, but she
          exhibited a splendid bouquet of scarlet and purple
          flowers. Mr. Carlyle had himself given it to her
          that morning.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle saw them all at the windows of the large
          upper drawing-room, and came in; he was then on his
          way to the Town-hall. Shaking hands, laughter,
          hearty and hasty good wishes; and he quitted the
          room again. Barbara stole after him for a sweeter
          farewell.</p>
  <p>"God bless and prosper you, Archibald, my dearest!"</p>
  <p>The business of the day began. Mr. Carlyle was proposed
          by Sir John Dobede, and seconded by Mr. Herbert.
          Lord Mount Severn, than whom not a busier man was
          there, would willingly have been proposer and
          seconder too, but he had no local influence in the
          place. Sir Francis Levison was proposed also by two
          gentlemen of standing. The show of hands was
          declared to be in favour of Mr. Carlyle. It was;
          about twenty to one. Upon which the baronet's
          friends demanded a poll.</p>
  <pb n="155"/>
  <p>Then all was bustle, and scuffle, and confusion.
          Everybody tearing away to the hustings, which had
          been fixed in a convenient spot, the Town-hall not
          affording the accommodation necessary for a poll.
          Candidates, and proposers and seconders, and
          gentlemen, and officers, and mob, hustling and
          jostling each other. Mr. Carlyle was linked
          arm-in-arm with Sir John Dobede; Sir John's arm was
          within Lord Mount Severn's—but, as to order, it was
          impossible to observe any. To gain the place, they
          had to pass the house of Miss Carlyle. Young Vane,
          who was in the thick of the crowd—of course—cast his
          eyes up to its lined windows, took off his hat and
          waved it. "Carlyle and honour for ever!" shouted out
          he.</p>
  <p>The ladies laughed and nodded, and shook their
          handkerchiefs, and displayed their
          scarlet-and-purple colours. The crowd took up the
          shout, till the very air echoed with it. "Carlyle
          and honour for ever!" Barbara's tears were falling;
          but she smiled through them at one pair of loving
          eyes which sought out hers.</p>
  <p>"A galaxy of beauty!" whispered Mr. Drake, in the ear of
          Sir Francis. "How the women rally round him! I tell
          you what, Levison: you and the government were
          stupid, to go on with the contest: and I said so,
          days ago. You have no more chance against Carlyle,
          than that bit of straw in the air has against the
          wind. You ought to have withdrawn in time."</p>
  <p>"Like a coward!" angrily retorted Sir Francis. "No. I'll
          go on with it to the last."</p>
  <p>"How lovely his wife is!" resumed Mr. Drake; his admiring
          eyes cast up at Barbara. "I say, Levison, was the
          first one as charming?"</p>
  <p>Sir Francis looked perfectly savage: the allusion did <pb n="156"/> not please him. But, ere another word
          could be spoken, some one in the garb of a
          policeman, who had wound his way through the crowd,
          laid his hand on the baronet.</p>
  <p>"Sir Francis Levison, you are my prisoner."</p>
  <p>Nothing worse than <hi>debt</hi> occurred at the moment
          to the mind of Sir Francis. But that was quite
          enough, and he turned purple with rage.</p>
  <p>"Your hands off, vermin! How dare you?"</p>
  <p>A quick movement, a slight click, a hustle from the
          wondering crowd more immediately around, and the
          handcuffs were on. Utter amazement alone prevented
          Mr. Drake from knocking down the policeman. A dozen
          vituperating tongues assailed him.</p>
  <p>"I'm sorry to do it in this public place and manner,"
          said the officer, partly to Sir Francis, partly to
          the gentlemen around: "but I couldn't come across
          him last night, do as I would. And the warrant has
          been in my hands since five o'clock yesterday
          afternoon. Sir Francis Levison, I arrest you for the
          wilful murder of George Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>The crowd fell back; the crowd was paralysed with
          consternation; the word was passed from one extreme
          of it to the other, back, and across again, and the
          excitement grew high. The ladies, looking from Miss
          Carlyle's windows, saw what had happened, though
          they could not divine the cause. Some of them turned
          pale at the sight of the handcuffs, and Mary Pinner,
          an exciteable girl, screamed.</p>
  <p>Pale? What was their gentle paleness, compared with the
          frightfully livid hue that disfigured the features
          of Francis Levison? His agitation was pitiable to
          witness, his face a terror to look upon: once or <pb n="157"/> twice he gasped as if in an agony; and
          then his eyes happened to fall on Otway Bethel, who
          stood near. Shorn of its adornments—which might not
          be thought adornments on paper—the following was the
          sentence that burst involuntarily from his lips:</p>
  <p>"You hound! It is you who have done this!"</p>
  <p>"No! by—" Whether Mr. Otway Bethel was about to swear by
          Jupiter, or Juno, never was decided, the sentence
          being cut ignominiously short at the above two
          words. Another policeman, in the summary manner
          exercised towards Sir Francis, had clapped a pair of
          handcuffs upon <hi>him.</hi></p>
  <p>"Mr. Otway Bethel, I arrest you as an accomplice in the
          murder of George Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>You may be sure, the whole assembly was arrested
          too—figuratively; and stood with eager gaze and open
          ears. Colonel Bethel, quitting the
          scarlet-and-purple ranks, flashed into those of the
          yellows. He knew his nephew was graceless enough;
          but—to see him with a pair of handcuffs on!</p>
  <p>"What does all this mean?" he authoritatively demanded of
          the officers.</p>
  <p>"It's no fault of ours, colonel; we have but executed the
          warrant," answered one of them. "The magistrates
          issued it yesterday against these two gentlemen, on
          suspicion of their being concerned in the murder of
          Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>"In conjunction with Richard Hare?" cried the astounded
          colonel, gazing from one to the other, prisoners and
          officers, in scared bewilderment.</p>
  <p>"It's alleged now, that Richard Hare didn't have nothing
          to do with it," returned the man. "It's said he is
          innocent. I'm sure <hi>I</hi> don't know."</p>
  <pb n="158"/>
  <p>"I swear that <hi>I</hi> am innocent," passionately
          uttered Otway Bethel.</p>
  <p>"Well, sir, you have only got to prove it," civilly
          rejoined the policeman.</p>
  <p>Miss Carlvle and Lady Dobede leaned from the window;
          their curiosity too excited to remain silent longer.
          Mrs. Hare was standing by their side. "What is the
          matter?" both asked of the upturned faces
          immediately beneath.</p>
  <p>"Them two, the fine member, as wanted to be, and young
          Bethel, be arrested for murder," spoke a man's clear
          voice in answer. "The tale runs as they murdered
          Hallijohn, and then laid it on the shoulders of
          young Dick Hare; who didn't do it, after all."</p>
  <p>A faint wailing cry of startled pain, and Barbara flew to
          Mrs. Hare, from whom it proceeded. "Oh, mamma, my
          dear mamma, take comfort! Do not suffer this to
          agitate you to illness. Richard <hi>is</hi>
          innocent, and it will surely be so proved.
          Archibald," she added, beckoning to her husband, in
          her alarm, "come if you can, and say a word of
          assurance to mamma."</p>
  <p>It was impossible that Mr. Carlyle could hear the words:
          but he could see that his wife was agitated, and
          wanted him. "I will be back with you in a few
          moments," he said to his friends, as he began to
          elbow his way through the crowd: which made way,
          when they saw who the elbower was.</p>
  <p>Into another room, away from the gay visitors, they got
          Mrs. Hare: and Mr. Carlyle locked the door to keep
          them out, unconsciously taking out the key. Only
          himself and his wife were with her; except Madame
          Vine, who had been despatched by somebody with a
          bottle of smelling salts. Barbara knelt at her <pb n="159"/> mamma's feet; Mr. Carlyle leaned over
          her, her hands sympathisingly held in his. Madame
          Vine would have escaped, but the key was gone.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald, tell me the truth! <hi>You</hi> will not
          deceive me," she gasped, in earnest entreaty, the
          cold dew gathering on her pale, gentle face. "Is the
          time come to prove my boy's innocence?"</p>
  <p>"It is."</p>
  <p>"Is it possible that it can be that false, bad man who is
          guilty?"</p>
  <p>"From my soul I believe him to be," replied Mr. Carlyle,
          glancing round to make sure that none could hear the
          assertion, save those present. "But what I say to
          you and Barbara, I would not say to the world.
          Whatever be the man's guilt, I am not his Nemesis.
          Dear Mrs. Hare, take courage; take comfort: happier
          days are coming round."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare was weeping silently. Barbara rose, and laid
          her mamma's head lovingly upon her bosom.</p>
  <p>"Take care of her, my darling," Mr. Carlyle whispered to
          his wife. "Don't leave her for a moment: and don't
          let that chattering crew in, from the next room. I
          beg your pardon, madame."</p>
  <p>His hand had touched Madame Vine's neck, in turning
          round; that is, had touched the jacket that encased
          it. He unlocked the door and regained the street:
          while Madame Vine sat down, with her beating and
          rebellious heart.</p>
  <p>Amidst the shouts, the jeers, and the escort of the mob,
          Sir Francis Levison and Otway Bethel were lodged in
          the station-house, preparatory to their examination
          before the magistrates. Never, sure, was so
          mortifying an interruption known. So thought Sir
          Francis's <pb n="160"/> party. And they deemed it
          well, after some consultation amongst themselves, to
          withdraw his name as a candidate for the membership.
          That he never had a shadow of chance from the first,
          most of them knew.</p>
  <p>But there's an incident yet, to tell of the election-day.
          You have seen Miss Carlyle in her glory, her
          brocaded silk, standing on end with richness, her
          displayed colours, her pride in her noble brother!
          But could she have divined who and what was right
          above her head, at an upper window, I know not what
          the consequences would have been.</p>
  <p>No less than that "brazen huzzy," Afy Hallijohn! Smuggled
          in by Miss Carlyle's servants, there she was, in
          full dress too. A green-and-white-checked sarcenet,
          flounced up to the waist, over a crinoline extending
          from here to yonder; a fancy bonnet, worn on the
          plait of her hair behind, with a wreath and a veil;
          delicate white gloves, and a swinging handkerchief
          of lace, redolent of musk. It was well for Miss
          Corny's peace that she remained in ignorance of that
          daring act. There stood Afy, bold as a sunflower,
          exhibiting herself and her splendour to the admiring
          eyes of the mob below, gentle and simple.</p>
  <p>"He is a handsome man, after all," quoth she to Miss
          Carlyle's maids, when Sir Francis Levison arrived
          opposite the house.</p>
  <p>"But such a horrid creature!" was the response. "And to
          think that he should come here to oppose Mr.
          Archibald!"</p>
  <p>"What's that?" cried Afy. "What are they stopping for?
          There are some policemen there! Oh," shrieked Afy,
          "if they haven't put handcuffs on him! <pb n="161"/>
          Whatever has he done? What can he have been up
          to?"</p>
  <p>"Where? Who? What?" cried the servants, bewildered with
          the crowd. "Put 'ancuffs on which?"</p>
  <p>"Sir Francis Levison. Hush! What is it they say?"</p>
  <p>Listening; looking; turning from white to red, from red
          to white, Afy stood. But she could make nothing of
          it: she could not divine the cause of the commotion.
          The man's answer to Miss Carlyle and Lady Dobede,
          clear though it was, did not quite reach her ears.
          "What did he say?" she cried.</p>
  <p>"Good Heavins!" cried one of the maids, whose hearing had
          been quicker than Afy's. "He says they are arrested
          for the wilful murder of Hal—of your father, Miss
          Afy. Sir Francis Levison and Otway Bethel."</p>
  <p>" <hi>What?</hi> " shrieked Afy, her eyes starting.</p>
  <p>"Levison was the man who did it, he says," continued the
          servant, bending her ear to listen. "And young
          Richard Hare, he says, has been innocent all
          along."</p>
  <p>Afy slowly gathered in the sense of the words; she gasped
          twice, as if her breath had gone; and then, with a
          stagger and a shiver, fell heavily to the ground.
          Afy Hallijohn was in a fainting fit.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XV. MR JIFFIN.</head>
  <p><hi>Afy Hallijohn</hi> , recovered from her fainting fit,
          had to be smuggled out of Miss Carlyle's, as she had
          been smuggled in. She was of an elastic nature, and
          the shock, or the surprise, or the heat—or whatever
          it might have been—being over, Afy was herself
          again. She minced along, in all her vanity, on her
          return to Mrs. Latimer's: her laced handkerchief
          flourishing from one hand, and her flounces jauntily
          raised with the other, to the display of her worked
          petticoat, and her kid boots, the heels a mile high.
          Let Afy alone for following the fashion, however
          preposterous it might be.</p>
  <p>Not very far removed from the residence of Miss Carlyle
          was a shop, in the cheese and ham and butter line. A
          very respectable shop, too, and kept by a very
          respectable man. A young man of a mild countenance,
          who had purchased the good-will of the business; and
          came down from London to take possession. His
          predecessor had amassed enough to retire, and people
          foretold that Mr. Jiffin would do the same. To say
          that Miss Carlyle dealt at the shop, will be
          sufficient to proclaim the good quality of the
          articles kept in it.</p>
  <p>When Afy arrived opposite the shop, Mr. Jiffin was <pb n="163"/> standing at the door; his shopman,
          inside, being at some urgent employment over the
          contents of a buttercask. Afy stopped. Mr. Jiffin
          admired her uncommonly, and she, always ready for
          anything in that way, had already enjoyed several
          passing flirtations with him.</p>
  <p>"Good day, Miss Hallijohn," cried he, warmly, tucking up
          his white apron and pushing it round to the back of
          his waist, in the best manner he could, as he held
          out his hand to her. For Afy had once hinted in
          terms of disparagement at that very apron.</p>
  <p>"Oh—how are you, Jiffin?" cried Afy, loftily, pretending
          not to have seen him standing there. And she
          condescended to put the tips of her white gloves
          into the offered hand, as she coquetted with her
          handkerchief, her veil, and her ringlets. I thought
          you would have shut up your shop to-day, Mr. Jiffin,
          and taken holiday."</p>
  <p>"Business must be attended to," responded Mr. Jiffin,
          quite lost in the contemplation of Afy's numerous
          attractions, unusually conspicuous, as they were.
          "Had I known that you were abroad, Miss Hallijohn,
          and enjoying holiday, perhaps I might have taken
          one, too, in the hope of coming across you some
          where or other."</p>
  <p>His words were bona fide as his admiration; Afy saw that.
          "And he's as simple as a calf," thought she.</p>
  <p>"The greatest pleasure I have in life, Miss Hallijohn, is
          to see you go by the shop window," continued Mr.
          Jiffin. "I'm sure it's like as if the sun itself
          passed."</p>
  <p>"Dear me!" bridled Afy, with a simper, "I don't know any
          good <hi>that</hi> can do you. You might have seen
          me go by an hour or two ago—if you had possessed <pb n="164"/> eyes. I was on my way to Miss
          Carlyle's," she continued, with the air of one who
          proclaims the fact of a morning call upon a
          duchess.</p>
  <p>"Where <hi>could</hi> my eyes have been?" ejaculated Mr.
          Jiffin, in an agony of regret. "In some of them
          precious butter-tubs, I shouldn't wonder! We have
          had a bad lot in, Miss Hallijohn, and I am going to
          return them."</p>
  <p>"Oh," said Afy, conspicuously resenting the remark, "I
          don't know anything about that sort of thing.
          Butter-tubs are beneath me."</p>
  <p>"Of course, of course, Miss Hallijohn," deprecated poor
          Jiffin. "They are very profitable, though, to those
          who understand the trade."</p>
  <p>"What <hi>is</hi> all that shouting?" cried Afy, alluding
          to a tremendous noise in the distance, which had
          continued for some little time.</p>
  <p>"It's the voters cheering Mr. Carlyle. I suppose you know
          that he's elected, Miss Hallijohn?"</p>
  <p>"No, I don't."</p>
  <p>"The other was withdrawn by his friends, so they made a
          short work of it; and Mr. Carlyle is our member. God
          bless him! there's not many like <hi>him.</hi></p>
  <p>"Are all these customers? Dear me, you'll have enough to
          do to attend to them; your man can't do it all; so I
          won't stay talking any longer."</p>
  <p>With a gracious flourish of her flounces, and wave of the
          handkerchief, Afy sailed off. And Mr. Jiffin, when
          he could withdraw his fascinated eyes from following
          her, turned into his shop, to assist in serving four
          or five servant girls, who had entered it.</p>
  <p>"It wouldn't be such a bad catch, after all,"
          soliloquised Afy, as she and her crinoline swayed
          along. <pb n="165"/> "Of course I'd never put my
          nose inside the shop— unless it was to order things,
          like another customer. There is a private entrance,
          thank goodness! And they say he has got the room
          over the shop beautifully fitted up as a
          drawing-room, with a plate-glass cheffonier, and
          Brussels carpet, and rosewood chairs and sofa, and
          all the rest of it. The parlour, too, behind the
          shop, is comfortable, and <hi>I</hi> 'd take care it
          was well furnished, if it isn't already. I'd make
          him buy a piano for the drawing-room: it looks
          stylish, even if one doesn't play upon it. And I'd
          keep two servants, cook and housemaid: 'tisn't I
          that would marry, to be waited upon by a black
          tinker of a maid-of-all-work. Jiffin is such a soft,
          he'd agree to anything. I'm sure he'd let me turn
          the house into a theatre if I liked, so that I left
          him the shop free for his business. He is welcome to
          that: the shop shall be his department, and the rest
          of the house mine. What's the good of a husband,
          except to work for you? They are only a worry,
          looking at them in any other light. I wonder how
          many bed-rooms there are? If there's none in the
          house of a good size, I'll have two rooms knocked
          into one. I never could sleep in a closet of a
          place. And I'll have a handsome bed with damask
          moreen hangings, one of those new Arabians, and a
          large mahogany wardrobe with wings, and a handsome
          glass and toilette, and a cheval-glass—besides the
          other necessary furniture. I'm not sure that I won't
          have a little iron bed put up for him, in a corner.
          Separate beds are quite the fashion now, amongst the
          nobility. I'll see. Yes; take it for all in all, it
          wouldn't be so bad a catch. The worst is the name.
          Jiffin. Joe Jiffin! How could I ever bear to be
          called Mrs. Joe Jiffin? Not but—Goodness me! what do
          you want?"</p>
  <pb n="166"/>
  <p>The interruption to Afy's aerial castle was caused by Mr.
          Ebenezer James. That gentleman, who had been walking
          with quick steps to overtake her, gave her flounces
          a twitch behind, to let her know somebody had come
          up.</p>
  <p>"How are you, Afy? I was going after you to Mrs.
          Latimer's, not knowing but you had returned home. I
          saw you this morning at Miss Corny's windows."</p>
  <p>"Now I don't want any of your sauce, Ebenezer James.
          Afy-ing me! The other day, when you were on with
          your nonsense, I said you should keep your distance.
          You told Mr. Jiffin that I was an old sweetheart of
          yours. I heard of it.!"</p>
  <p>"So you were," laughed Mr. Ebenezer.</p>
  <p>"I never was," flashed Afy. "I was the company of your
          betters in those days: and if there had been no
          betters in the case, I should have scorned
            <hi>you</hi> . Why! you have been a strolling
          player!"</p>
  <p>"And what have you been?" returned Mr. Ebenezer, a quiet
          tone of meaning running through his good-humoured
          laughter.</p>
  <p>Afy's cheeks flushed scarlet, and she raised her hand
          with a quick, menacing gesture. But that they were
          in the public street, Mr. Ebenezer might have found
          his ears boxed. Afy dropped her hand again, and made
          a dead stand-still.</p>
  <p>"If you think any vile, false insinuations, that you may
          concoct, will injure me, you are mistaken, Ebenezer
          James. I am too much respected in the place. So,
          don't you try it on."</p>
  <p>"Why, Afy, what has put you out? <hi>I</hi> don't want to
          injure you. Couldn't do it, if I tried, as you say,"
          he added, with another quiet laugh. "I have been in
            <pb n="167"/> too many scrapes myself, to let my
          tongue bring other folks into one."</p>
  <p>"There, that's enough. Just take yourself off. It's not
          over reputable to have you at one's side in
          public."</p>
  <p>"Well, I will relieve you of my company, if you'll let me
          deliver my commission. Though, as to 'reputable'
          —however, I won't put you out further. You are
          wanted at the justice-room at three o'clock this
          afternoon. And don't fail, please."</p>
  <p>"Wanted at the justice-room!" retorted Afy. "I! What
          for?"</p>
  <p>"And must not fail, as I say," repeated Mr. Ebenezer.
          "You saw Levison taken up; your old flame—"</p>
  <p>Afy stamped her foot in indignant interruption. "Take
          care what you say, Ebenezer James! Flame! He? I'll
          have you up for defamation of character."</p>
  <p>"Don't be a goose, Afy. It's of no use riding the high
          horse with me. You know where I saw you; and saw
          him. People here said you were with Dick Hare: I
          could have told them better: but I did not. It was
          no affair of mine, that I should proclaim it,
          neither is it now. Levison, <hi>alias</hi> Thorn, is
          taken up for your father's murder, and you are
          wanted to give evidence."</p>
  <p>A change came over Miss Afy. Her lofty looks changed to
          an aspect particularly cowed and humble, not to say
          of terror. "I know nothing of the murder!" she
          stammered, striving to brave it out still, in words
          and tone. "And I will not attend."</p>
  <p>"You must, Afy," he answered, putting a piece of paper in
          her hand, "There! that's your subpoena. Ball thought
          you would not come without one."</p>
  <pb n="168"/>
  <p>"I will never give evidence against Levison," she
          uttered, tearing the subpoena to pieces, and
          scattering them in the street. "I swear I won't.
          There, for you! Will I help to hang an innocent man,
          when it was Dick Hare who was the guilty one? No!
          I'll walk myself off a hundred miles away first, and
          stop in hiding till it's over. I shan't forget this
          turn that you have chosen to play me, Ebenezer
          James."</p>
  <p>" <hi>I</hi> chosen! Why, do you suppose I have had
          anything to do with it? Don't take up that notion,
          Afy. Mr. Ball put that subpoena in my hand, and told
          me to serve it. He might have given it to the other
          clerk, just as he gave it to me: it was all chance.
          If I could do you a good turn, I'd do it: not a bad
          one."</p>
  <p>Afy strode on at railway speed, waving him off. "Mind you
          don't fail, Afy," he said, as he prepared to
          return.</p>
  <p>"Fail," answered she, with flashing eyes. "I shall fail
          giving evidence, if you mean that. They don't get me
          up to their justice-room. Neither by force nor
          stratagem."</p>
  <p>Ebenezer James looked after her as she tore along. "What
          a spirit that Afy has got, when it's put up!" quoth
          he. "She'll be off out of reach unless she's
          stopped. She's a great simpleton! nothing particular
          need come out about her and Thorn: unless she lets
          it out herself, in her tantrums. Here comes Ball, I
          declare! I must tell him."</p>
  <p>On went Afy, and gained Mrs. Latimer's. That lady,
          suffering from indisposition, was confined to the
          house. Afy, divesting herself of certain little odds
          and ends of her finery, made her way into Mrs.
          Latimer's presence.</p>
  <pb n="169"/>
  <p>"Oh, ma'am, such heart-rending news as I have had!" began
          she. "A relation of mine is dying, and wants to see
          me. I ought to be away by the next train."</p>
  <p>"Dear me!" cried Mrs. Latimer, after a pause of dismay.
          "But how can I do without you, Afy?"</p>
  <p>"It's a dying request, ma'am," pleaded Afy, covering her
          eyes with her handkerchief—not the lace one—as if in
          the depth of woe. "Of course I wouldn't ask you,
          under any other circumstances, suffering as you
          are!"</p>
  <p>"Where does your relation live?" asked Mrs. Latimer. "How
          long shall you be away?"</p>
  <p>Afy mentioned the first town that came uppermost, and
          "hoped" she might be back to-morrow.</p>
  <p>"What relation is it?" continued Mrs. Latimer. "I thought
          you had no relatives; except Joyce, and your aunt,
          Mrs. Kane."</p>
  <p>"This is another aunt," cried Afy, softly. "I have never
          mentioned her, not being friends. Differences
          divided us. Of course that makes me all the more
          anxious to obey her request."</p>
  <p>An uncommon good hand at an impromptu tale was Afy. And
          Mrs. Latimer consented to her demand. Afy flew
          up-stairs, attired herself once more, put up one or
          two things in a small leather bag, placed some money
          in her purse, and left the house.</p>
  <p>Sauntering idly on the pavement on the sunny side of the
          street, was a policeman. He crossed over to Afy,
          with whom he had a slight acquaintance.</p>
  <p>"Good day, Miss Hallijohn. A fine day, is it not?"</p>
  <p>"Fine enough," returned Afy, provoked at being hindered.
          "I can't talk to you now, for I am in a hurry."</p>
  <pb n="170"/>
  <p>The faster she walked, the faster he walked, keeping at
          her side. Afy's pace increased to a run. His
          increased to a run too.</p>
  <p>"Why are you in such haste?" asked he.</p>
  <p>"Well, it's nothing to you. And I'm sure I don't want you
          to dance attendance upon me just now. There's a time
          for all things. I'll have some chatter with you
          another day."</p>
  <p>"One would think you were hurrying to catch a train."</p>
  <p>"So I am—if you must have your curiosity satisfied. I am
          going out on a little pleasure excursion, Mr.
          Inquisitive."</p>
  <p>"For long?"</p>
  <p>"U—m. Home to-morrow, perhaps. Is it true that Mr.
          Carlyle's elected?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, yes. Don't go up that way, please."</p>
  <p>"Not up this way!" repeated Afy. "It's the nearest road
          to the station. It cuts off all that corner."</p>
  <p>The officer laid his hand upon her: gently. Afy thought
          he was venturing it in sport—as if deeming her too
          charming to be parted with.</p>
  <p>"What do you mean by your nonsense? I tell you I have not
          time for it now. Take your hand off me," she added,
          angrily—for the hand was clasping her closer.</p>
  <p>"I am sorry to hurt a lady's feelings, especially yours,
          miss: but I daren't take it off, and I daren't part
          with you. My instructions are to take you on at once
          to the witness-room. Your evidence is wanted this
          afternoon."</p>
  <p>If you ever saw a ghost more livid than ghosts in
          ordinary, you may picture to your mind the
          appearance <pb n="171"/> of Afy Hallijohn just then.
          She did not faint, as she had done once before, that
          day, but she looked as if she should die. One sharp
          cry, instantly suppressed, for Afy did retain some
          presence of mind, and remembered that she was in the
          public road; one sharp tussle for liberty, and she
          resigned herself, perforce, to her fate.</p>
  <p>"I have no evidence to give," she said, in a calmer tone.
          "I know nothing of the facts."</p>
  <p>"I'm sure <hi>I</hi> don't know anything of them,"
          returned the man. "I don't know why you are wanted.
          When instructions are given us, miss, we can't ask
          what they mean. I was bid to watch that you didn't
          go off out of the town, and to bring you on to the
          witness-room, if you attempted it, and I have tried
          to do it as politely as possible."</p>
  <p>"You don't imagine I am going to walk through West Lynne
          with your hand upon me."</p>
  <p>"I'll take it off, Miss Hallijohn, if you'll give a
          promise not to bolt. You see, 'twould come to
          nothing, if you did; for I should be up with you in
          a couple of yards—besides, it would be drawing
          folks' attention on you. You couldn't hope to outrun
          me, or to be a match for me in strength."</p>
  <p>"I will go quietly," said Afy. "Take it off."</p>
  <p>She kept her word. Afy was no simpleton, and knew that
          she <hi>was</hi> no match for him. She had fallen
          into the hands of the Philistines, and must make the
          best of it. So they walked through the street as if
          they were but taking a quiet stroll; he gallantly
          bearing the leather bag. Miss Carlyle's shocked eyes
          happened to fall upon them as they passed her
          window: she wondered where could be the eyes of the
          man's inspector.</p>
  <pb n="172"/>
  <p>Afy was lodged in the witness-room; a small room with a
          skylight at the top. She passed her time pretty
          agreeably, considering all things: partly in
          concocting a tale to tell to Mrs. Latimer; partly in
          deliberating how much she might admit before the
          justices, without compromising herself. But, in
          using the word "compromising," you must not suppose
          it refers to the murder. Afy was as innocent of that
          as you or I: she firmly believed in Levison's
          innocence, and in the guilt of Richard Hare. Still,
          Afy was aware that her doings at that period would
          not shine out clearly in the full light of day, or
          in the gossip of West Lynne.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVI. THE JUSTICE-ROOM.</head>
  <p><hi>The</hi> magistrates took their seats on the bench.
          The bench would not hold them: all, in the
          Commission of the Peace, flocked in. Any other day,
          they would not have been at West Lynne. As to the
          room, the wonder was, how it ever got emptied again,
          so densely was it packed. Sir Francis Levison's
          friends were there in a body. They did not believe a
          word of the accusation: a scandalous affair, cried
          they, got up probably by some of the
          scarlet-and-purple party. Lord Mount Severn, who
          chose to be present, had a place assigned him on the
          bench; Lord Vane got the best place he could fight
          for amidst the crowd. Mr. Justice Hare sat as
          chairman, unusually stern, unbending, and grim. No
          favour would he show; but no unfairness: had it been
          to save his son from hanging, he would not adjudge
          guilt to Francis Levison against his conscience.
          Colonel Bethel was likewise on the bench; stern
          also.</p>
  <p>In that primitive place—primitive in what related to the
          justice-room and the justices—things were not
          conducted with the regularity of the law. The law
          there was often a dead letter. No very grave cases
          were decided there: they went to Lynneborough; a
          month at the treadmill, or a week's imprisonment, or
          a bout of <pb n="174"/> whipping for juveniles, were
          pretty nearly the harshest sentences pronounced. In
          this examination, as in others, evidence was
          advanced that was inadmissible— at least that would
          have been inadmissible in a more orthodox court;
          hearsay testimony, and irregularities of that
          nature. Mr. Rubiny watched the case on behalf of Sir
          Francis Levison.</p>
  <p>Mr. Ball opened the proceedings; giving the account which
          had been imparted to him by Richard Hare: but not
          mentioning Richard as his informant. He was
          questioned as to whence he obtained his information,
          but replied that it was not convenient at present to
          disclose the source. The stumbling-block to the
          magistrates appeared to be, the identifying Levison
          with Thorn. Ebenezer James came forward to prove
          it.</p>
  <p>"What do you know of the prisoner, Sir Francis Levison?"
          questioned Justice Herbert.</p>
  <p>"Not much," responded Mr. Ebenezer. "I used to know him
          as Captain Thorn."</p>
  <p>" <hi>Captain</hi> Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Afy Hallijohn called him captain; but I understood he
          was but a lieutenant."</p>
  <p>"From whom did you understand that?"</p>
  <p>"From Afy. She was the only person I heard speak of
          him."</p>
  <p>"And you say you were in the habit of seeing him? —in the
          place mentioned, the Abbey Wood?"</p>
  <p>"I saw him there repeatediy: also at Hallijohn's
          cottage."</p>
  <p>"Did you speak with him—as Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Two or three times. I addressed him as Thorn, and he
          answered to the name. I had no suspicion but what it
          was his name. Otway Bethel"—casting his <pb n="175"/> eyes on Mr. Otway, who stood in his shaggy
          attire— "also knew him as Thorn; and so, I make no
          doubt, did Locksley, for he was always in the
          wood."</p>
  <p>"Anybody else?"</p>
  <p>"Poor Hallijohn himself knew him as Thorn. He said to Afy
          one day, in my presence, that he would not have that
          confounded dandy, Thorn, coming there."</p>
  <p>"Were those the words he used?"</p>
  <p>"They were. 'That confounded dandy, Thorn.' I remember
          Afy's reply: it was rather insolent. She said Thorn
          was as free to come there as anybody else; and she
          would not be found fault with, as though she was not
          fit to take care of herself."</p>
  <p>"That is nothing to the purpose. Were any others
          acquainted with this Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"I should imagine the elder sister, Joyce, was. And the
          one who knew him best of all, was young Richard
          Hare."</p>
  <p><hi>Old</hi> Richard Hare, from his place on the bench,
          frowned menacingly at an imaginary Richard.</p>
  <p>"What took Thorn into the wood so often?"</p>
  <p>"He was courting Afy."</p>
  <p>"With an intention of marrying her?"</p>
  <p>"Well—no," cried Mr. Ebenezer, with a twist of the mouth;
          "I should not suppose he entertained any intention
          of that sort. He used to come over from Swainson, or
          its neighbourhood; riding a splendid horse."</p>
  <p>"Whom did you suppose him to be?"</p>
  <p>"I supposed him to be moving in the upper ranks of life.
          There was no doubt of it. His dress, his manners,
          his tone, all proclaimed it. He appeared to wish <pb n="176"/> to shun observation, and evidently did
          not care to be seen. He rarely arrived until
          twilight."</p>
  <p>"Did you see him there on the night of Hallijohn's
          murder?"</p>
  <p>"No. I was not there myself that evening, so could not
          have seen him."</p>
  <p>"Did a suspicion cross your mind at any time that he may
          have been guilty of the murder?"</p>
  <p>"Never. Richard Hare was accused of it, and it never
          occurred to me to suppose he had not done it."</p>
  <p>"Pray how many years is this ago?" sharply interrupted
          Mr. Rubiny, perceiving that the witness was done
          with.</p>
  <p>"Let's see?" responded Mr. Ebenezer. "I can't be sure as
          to a year, without reckoning up. A dozen, if not
          more."</p>
  <p>"And you mean to say that you can swear to Sir Francis
          Levison being that man—with all those years
          intervening?"</p>
  <p>"I swear that he is the same man. I am as positive of his
          identity as I am of my own."</p>
  <p>"Without having seen him from that time to this!"
          derisively returned the lawyer. "Nonsense,
          witness!"</p>
  <p>"I did not say that," returned Mr. Ebenezer.</p>
  <p>The court pricked up its ears. "Have you seen him between
          then and now?" asked one of them.</p>
  <p>"Once."</p>
  <p>"Where, and when?"</p>
  <p>"It was in London. About eighteen months after the period
          of the murder."</p>
  <p>"What communication had you with him?"</p>
  <p>"None at all. I only saw him. Quite by chance."</p>
  <pb n="177"/>
  <p>"And whom did you suppose him to be then? Thorn?—or
          Levison?"</p>
  <p>"Thorn, certainly. I never dreamt of his being Levison,
          until he appeared here now, to oppose Mr.
          Carlyle."</p>
  <p>A wild, savage curse shot through Sir Francis's heart as
          he heard the words. What demon <hi>had</hi>
          possessed him to venture his neck into the lion's
          den? There had been a strong, hidden power holding
          him back from it, independent of his dislike to face
          Mr. Carlyle: how could he have been so mad as to
          disregard it? How!</p>
  <p>"You may have been mistaken, witness, as to the identity
          of the man you saw in London. It may not have been
          the Thorn you had known here."</p>
  <p>Mr. Ebenezer James smiled a peculiar smile. "I was not
          mistaken," he said, his tone sounding remarkably
          significant. "I am upon my oath."</p>
  <p>"Call Aphrodite Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>The lady appeared; supported by her friend the policeman.
          And Mr. Ebenezer James was desired by Mr. Ball to
          leave the court while she gave her evidence.
          Doubtless he had his reasons.</p>
  <p>"What is your name?"</p>
  <p>"Afy," replied she, looking daggers at everybody, and
          sedulously keeping her back turned upon Francis
          Levison and Otway Bethel.</p>
  <p>"Your name in full, if you please. You were not
          christened 'Afy?'"</p>
  <p>"Aphrodite Hallijohn. You all know my name as well as I
          do. Where's the use of asking useless
          questions?"</p>
  <p>"Swear the witness," said Mr. Justice Hare. The first
          word he had uttered.</p>
  <pb n="178"/>
  <p>"I won't be sworn," said Afy.</p>
  <p>"You must be sworn," said Mr. Justice Herbert.</p>
  <p>"But I say I wont," repeated Afy.</p>
  <p>"Then we must commit you to prison for contempt of
          court."</p>
  <p>There was no mercy in his tone, and Afy turned white. Sir
          John Dobede interposed.</p>
  <p>"Young woman, had <hi>you</hi> a hand in the murder of
          your father?"</p>
  <p>"I!" returned Afy, struggling with passion, temper, and
          excitement. "How dare you ask me so unnatural a
          question, sir? He was the kindest father!" she
          added, battling with her tears. "I loved him dearly.
          I would have saved his life with mine."</p>
  <p>"And yet you refuse to give evidence that may assist in
          bringing his destroyer to justice!"</p>
  <p>"No; I don't refuse on that score. I should like his
          destroyer to be hanged, and I'd go to see it. But,
          who knows what other questions you may be asking me
          —about things that concern neither you nor anybody
          else? That's why I object."</p>
  <p>"We have only to deal with what bears upon the murder.
          The questions, put to you, will relate to that."</p>
  <p>Afy considered. "Well, you may swear me, then," she said.
          Little notion had she of the broad guage those
          questions would run upon. And she was sworn
          accordingly. Very unwillingly yet. For Afy, who
          would have told lies by the bushel <hi>unsworn</hi>
          , did look upon an oath as a serious matter, and
          felt herself compelled to speak the truth when
          examined under it.</p>
  <p>"How did you become acquinted with a gentleman you often
          saw in those days—Captain Thorn?"</p>
  <pb n="179"/>
  <p>"There!" uttered the dismayed Afy. "You are beginning
          already. <hi>He</hi> had nothing to do with it. He
          did not do the murder."</p>
  <p>"You have sworn to answer the questions put," was the
          uncompromising rejoinder. "How did you become
          acquainted with Captain Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"I met him at Swainson," doggedly answered Afy. "I went
          over there one day, just for a spree, and I met him
          in at a pastrycook's."</p>
  <p>"And he fell in love with your pretty face?" said Lawyer
          Ball, taking up the examination.</p>
  <p>In the incense to her vanity, Afy nearly forgot her
          seruples. "Yes, he did," she answered, casting a
          smile of general fascination round upon the
          court.</p>
  <p>"And got out of you where you lived; and entered upon his
          courting; riding over nearly every evening to see
          you?"</p>
  <p>"Well," acknowledged Afy, "there was no harm in it."</p>
  <p>"Oh, certainly not," acquiesced the lawyer, in a
          pleasant, free tone, to put the witness at her ease.
          "Rather, good, I should say: I wish I had had the
          like luck. Did you know him at that time by the name
          of Levison?"</p>
  <p>"No. He said he was Captain Thorn, and I thought he
          was."</p>
  <p>"Did you know where he lived?"</p>
  <p>"No. He never said that. I thought he was stopping
          temporarily at Swainson."</p>
  <p>"And—dear me! what a sweet bonnet that is you have
          on!"</p>
  <p>Afy—whose egregious vanity was her besetting sin, who
          possessed enough of it for any ten pretty women <pb n="180"/> going—cast a glance out of the corners
          of her eyes at the admired bonnet, and became Mr.
          Ball's entirely.</p>
  <p>"And how long was it, after your first meeting with him,
          before you discovered his real name?"</p>
  <p>"Not for a long time. Several months."</p>
  <p>"Subsequent to the murder, I presume?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>
  <p>Mr. Ball's eyes gave a twinkle, and the unconscious Afy
          surreptitiously smoothed, with one finger, the
          glossy parting of her hair.</p>
  <p>"Besides Captain Thorn, what gentlemen were in the wood,
          the night of the murder?"</p>
  <p>"Richard Hare was there. Otway Bethel and Locksley also.
          Those were all I saw—until the crowd came."</p>
  <p>"Were Locksley and Mr. Otway Bethel martyrs to your
          charms—as the other two were?"</p>
  <p>"No indeed," was the witness's answer, with an indignant
          toss of the head. "A couple of poaching fellows,
          like them! They had better have tried it on!"</p>
  <p>"Which of the two, Hare or Thorn, was inside the cottage
          with you that evening?"</p>
  <p>Afy came out of her vanity and hesitated. She was
          beginning to wonder where the questions would get
          to.</p>
  <p>"You are upon your oath, witness!" thundered Mr. Justice
          Hare. "If it was my—if it was Richard Hare who was
          with you, say so. But there must be no equivocation
          here."</p>
  <p>Afy was startled. "It was Thorn," she answered to Mr.
          Ball.</p>
  <p>"And where was Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know. He came down, but I sent him away: I would
          not admit him. I dare say he lingered in the
          wood."</p>
  <pb n="181"/>
  <p>"Did he leave a gun with you?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. It was one he had promised to lend my father. I put
          it down just inside the door: he told me it was
          loaded."</p>
  <p>"How long after this, was it, before you father
          interrupted you?"</p>
  <p>"He didn't interrupt us at all," returned Afy. "I never
          saw my father until I saw him dead."</p>
  <p>"Were you not in the cottage all the time?"</p>
  <p>"No. We went out for a stroll at the back. Captain Thorn
          wished me good bye there, and I stayed out."</p>
  <p>"Did you hear the gun go off?"</p>
  <p>"I heard a shot, as I was sitting on the stump of a a
          tree, and thinking. But I attached no importance to
          it, never supposing it was in the cottage."</p>
  <p>"What was it that Captain Thorn had to get from the
          cottage, after he quitted you? What had he left
          there?"</p>
  <p>Now, this was a random shaft. Lawyer Ball, a keen man,
          who had well weighed all points in the tale imparted
          to him by Richard Hare, as well as other points, had
          made his own deductions, and spoke accordingly. Afy
          was taken in.</p>
  <p>"He had left his hat there; nothing else. It was a warm
          evening, and he had gone out without it."</p>
  <p>"He told you, I believe, sufficient to convince you of
          the guilt of Richard Hare?" Another shaft thrown at
          random.</p>
  <p>"I did not want convincing. I knew it without. Everybody
          else knew it."</p>
  <p>"To be sure," equably returned Lawyer Ball. "Did Captain
          Thorn <hi>see</hi> it done?—did he tell you
          that?"</p>
  <pb n="182"/>
  <p>"He had got his hat and was away down the wood some
          little distance, when he heard voices in dispute in
          the cottage, and recognized one of them to be that
          of my father. The shot followed close upon it, and
          he guessed some mischief had been done: though he
          did not suspect its extent."</p>
  <p>"Thorn told you this! When?"</p>
  <p>"The same night; much later."</p>
  <p>"How came you to see him?"</p>
  <p>Afy hesitated. But she was sternly told to answer the
          question.</p>
  <p>"A boy came up to the cottage and called me out, and said
          a strange gentleman wanted to see me in the wood,
          and had given him sixpence to come for me. I went,
          and found Captain Thorn. He asked what the commotion
          was about, and I told him Richard Hare had killed my
          father. He said that now I spoke of him, he could
          recognise Richard Hare's as having been the other
          voice in the dispute."</p>
  <p>"What boy was that?—the one who came for you?"</p>
  <p>"It was Mother Whiteman's little son."</p>
  <p>"And Captain Thorn then gave you this version of the
          tragedy?"</p>
  <p>"It was the right version," resentfully spoke Afy.</p>
  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, because I am sure it was. Who else would kill him,
          but Richard Hare? It is a scandalous shame, your
          wanting to put it upon Thorn."</p>
  <p>"Look at the prisoner, Sir Francis Levison. Is it he whom
          you knew as Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. But that does not make him guilty of the
          murder."</p>
  <pb n="183"/>
  <p>"Of course it does not," complacently assented Lawyer
          Ball. "How long did you remain with Captain Thorn in
          London? Upon that little visit, you know."</p>
  <p>Afy stared like anybody moonstruck.</p>
  <p>"When you quitted this place after the tragedy it was to
          join Captain Thorn in London. How long, I ask, did
          you remain with him?" Entirely a random shaft,
          this</p>
  <p>"Who says I was with him? Who says I went after him?"
          flashed Afy, with scarlet cheeks.</p>
  <p>"I do," replied Lawyer Ball, taking notes of her
          confusion. "Come; it's over and done with; it's of
          no use to deny it now. We all go upon visits to
          friends sometimes."</p>
  <p>"I never heard anything so bold!" cried Afy. "Where will
          you tell me I went next?"</p>
  <p>"You are upon your oath, woman!" again interposed Justice
          Hare, and a trembling, as of agitation, might be
          detected in his voice, in spite of its ringing
          severity. "Were you with the prisoner, Levison, or
          were you with Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>" <hi>I</hi> with Richard Hare!" cried Afy, agitated in
          her turn, and shaking like an aspen-leaf, partly
          with discomfiture, partly with an unknown dread.
          "How dare that cruel falsehood be brought up again,
          to my face? I never saw Richard Hare after the night
          of the murder. I swear it. I swear that I have never
          seen him since. Visit <hi>him!</hi> I'd sooner visit
          Calcraft the hangman."</p>
  <p>There was truth in the words; in the tone. The chairman
          let fall the hand which had been raised to his face,
          holding on his eye-glasses; and a sort of
          selfcondemning fear arose, confusing his brain. His
          son, proved innocent of one part, <hi>might</hi> be
          proved innocent <pb n="184"/> of the other, and
          then—how would his own harsh conduct show out? West
          Lynne, in its charity, the justice, in his, had cast
          more odium to Richard with regard to his
          after-conduct touching this girl, than it had on the
          score of the murder.</p>
  <p>"Come," said Lawyer Ball, in a coaxing tone, "let us be
          pleasant. Of course you were not with Richard Hare;
          West Lynne is always ill-natured; you were only on a
          visit to Captain Thorn, as—as any other young lady
          might be?"</p>
  <p>Afy hung her head, cowed down to abject meekness.</p>
  <p>"Answer the question," came forth the chairman's voice
          again. " <hi>Were</hi> you with Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Yes." Though the answer was feeble enough.</p>
  <p>Mr. Ball coughed an insinuating cough. "Did you remain
          with him—say, two or three years?"</p>
  <p>"Not three."</p>
  <p>"A little over two, perhaps?"</p>
  <p>"There was no harm in it," shrieked Afy, with a catching
          sob of temper. "If I chose to live in London, and he
          chose to make a morning call upon me now and then,
          as an old friend, what's that to anybody? Where was
          the harm, I ask?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly—where was the harm? I am not insinuating any,"
          returned Lawyer Ball, with a wink of the eye
          furthest from the witness and the bench. "And,
          during the time that—that he was making these little
          morning calls upon you, did you know him to be
          Levison?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. I knew him to be Captain Levison then."</p>
  <p>"Did he ever tell you why he had assumed the name of
          Thorn?"</p>
  <p>"Only for a whim," he said. "The day he spoke <pb n="185"/> to me in the pastrycook's shop at Swainson,
          something came over him, in the spur of the moment,
          not to give his right name, so he gave the first
          that came into his head. He never thought to retain
          it; or, that other people would hear of him by
          it."</p>
  <p>"I dare say not," said Lawyer Ball, drily. "Well, Miss
          Afy, I believe that is all, for the present. I want
          Ebenezer James in again," he whispered to an officer
          of the justice-room, as the witness retired.</p>
  <p>Ebenezer James reappeared and took Afy's place. "You
          informed their worships just now that you had met
          Thorn in London, some eighteen months subsequent to
          the murder," began Lawyer Ball, launching another of
          his shafts. "This must have been during Afy
          Hallijohn's sojourn with him. Did you also see
            <hi>her?</hi> "</p>
  <p>Mr. Ebenezer opened his eyes. He knew nothing of the
          evidence just given by Afy, and wondered how on
          earth it had come out—that she had been with Thorn
          at all. He had never betrayed it. "Afy?" stammered
          he.</p>
  <p>"Yes, Afy," sharply returned the lawyer. "Their worships
          know that, when she left West Lynne, it was to join
          Thorn, not Richard Hare—though the latter has borne
          the credit of it. I ask you, did you see her? for
          she was then still connected with him."</p>
  <p>"Well—yes; I did," replied Mr. Ebenezer, his own scruples
          removed, but wondering still how it had been
          discovered; unless Afy had—as he had half prophesied
          she would—let it out in her "tantrums." "In fact, it
          was Afy whom I first saw."</p>
  <p>"State the circumstances."</p>
  <p>"I was up Paddington way one afternoon, and saw a lady
          going into a house. It was Afy Hallijohn. She <pb n="186"/> lived there, I found—had the
          drawing-room apartments. She invited me to stay tea
          with her, and I did."</p>
  <p>"Did you see Captain Levison there?"</p>
  <p>"I saw Thorn—as I thought him to be. Afy told me I must
          be away by eight o'clock, for she was expecting a
          friend, who sometimes came to sit with her for an
          hour's chat. But, in talking over old times— not
          that I could tell her much about West Lynne, for I
          had left it almost as long as she had—the time
          slipped on, past the hour. When Afy found that out,
          she hurried me off, and I had barely got outside the
          gate when a cab drove up, and Thorn alighted from
          it, and let himself in with a latch-key. That is all
          I know."</p>
  <p>"When you knew that the scandal of Afy's absence rested
          on Richard Hare, why could you not have said this,
          and cleared him, on your return to West Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"It was no affair of mine, that I should make it public.
          Afy asked me not to say I had seen her, and I
          promised her I would not. As to Richard Hare—a
          little extra scandal on his back was nothing; while
          there remained on it the worse scandal of the
          murder."</p>
  <p>"Stop a bit," interposed Mr. Rubiny, as the witness was
          about to retire. "You speak of the time being eight
          o'clock in the evening, sir. Was it dark?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Then how could you be certain it was Thorn, who got out
          of the cab and entered?"</p>
  <p>"I am quite certain. There was a gas-lamp right at the
          spot, and I saw him as well as I should have seen
          him in daylight. I knew his voice, too; could have
          sworn to it anywhere: and I could almost have sworn
          to him, by his splendid diamond ring. It flashed in
          the lamplight."</p>
  <pb n="187"/>
  <p>"His voice! Did he speak to you?"</p>
  <p>"No. But he spoke to the cabman. There was a half dispute
          between them. The man said Thorn had not paid him
          enough: that he had not allowed for the having kept
          him waiting twenty minutes on the road. Thorn swore
          at him a bit, and then flung him an extra
          shilling."</p>
  <p>The next witness was a man who had been groom to the late
          Sir Peter Levison. He testified that the prisoner,
          Francis Levison, had been on a visit to his master
          late in the summer and part of the autumn, the year
          that Hallijohn was killed. That he frequently rode
          out in the direction of West Lynne, especially
          towards evening, would be away three or four hours,
          and come home with the horse in a foam. Also that he
          picked up two letters at different times, which Mr.
          Levison had carelessly let fall from his pocket, and
          returned them to him. Both the notes were addressed
          "Captain Thorn." But they had not been through the
          post, for there was no further superscription on
          them: and the writing looked like a lady's. He
          remembered quite well hearing of the murder of
          Hallijohn, the witness added, in answer to a
          question; it made a great stir throughout the
          country. It was just at that same time that Mr.
          Levison concluded his visit, and returned to
          London.</p>
  <p>"A <hi>wonderful</hi> memory!" Mr. Rubiny sarcastically
          remarked.</p>
  <p>The witness, a quiet, respectable man, replied that he
            <hi>had</hi> a good memory: but that circumstances
          had impressed upon it particularly the fact that Mr.
          Levison's departure followed close upon the murder
          of Hallijohn.</p>
  <p>"What circumstances?" demanded the bench.</p>
  <pb n="188"/>
  <p>"One day, when Sir Peter was round at the stables,
          gentlemen, he was urging his nephew to prolong his
          visit, and asked what sudden freak was taking him
          off. Mr. Levison replied that unexpected business
          called him to London. While they were talking, the
          coachman came up, all in a heat, telling that
          Hallijohn of West Lynne had been murdered by young
          Mr. Hare. I remember Sir Peter said he could not
          believe it; and that it must have been an accident,
          not murder."</p>
  <p>"Is this all?"</p>
  <p>"There was more said. Mr. Levison, in a shamefaced sort
          of manner, asked his uncle, Would he let him have
          five or ten pounds? Sir Peter seemed angry, and
          asked, What had he done with the fifty-pound note he
          had made him a present of, only the previous
          morning? Mr. Levison replied that he had sent that
          away in a letter to a brother officer, to whom he
          was in debt. Sir Peter refused to believe it, and
          said he was more likely to have squandered it upon
          some disgraceful folly. Mr. Levison denied that he
          had: but he looked confused: indeed, his manner
          altogether was confused that morning."</p>
  <p>"Did he get the five or ten pounds?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know, gentlemen. I dare say he did, for my
          master was as persuadable as a woman, though he'd
          fly out a bit sometimes at first. Mr. Levison
          departed for London that same night."</p>
  <p>The last witness called was Mr. Dill. On the previous
          Tuesday evening, he had been returning home from
          spending an hour at Mr. Beauchamp's, when, in the
          field opposite to Mr. Justice Hare's, he suddenly
          heard a commotion. It arose from the meeting of Sir
          Francis Levison and Otway Bethel. The former
          appeared to <pb n="189"/> have been enjoying a
          solitary moonlight ramble; and the latter to have
          encountered him, unexpectedly. Words ensued. Bethel
          accused Sir Francis of "shirking" him; Sir Francis
          answered angrily—that he knew nothing of him, and
          nothing he wanted to know.</p>
  <p>"You were glad enough to know something of me the night
          of Hallijohn's murder," retorted Bethel to this. "Do
          you remember that I could hang you? One little word
          from me, and you would stand in Dick Hare's
          place."</p>
  <p>"You fool!" passionately cried Sir Francis. "You could
          not hang me without putting your own head in the
          noose. Had you not your hush-money? Are you wanting
          to do me out of more?"</p>
  <p>"A cursed paltry note of fifty pounds!" foamed Otway
          Bethel, "which, many a time since, I have wished my
          fingers had been blown off before they touched. I
          never should have touched it, but that I was
          altogether overwhelmed with the moment's confusion.
          I have not been able to look Mrs. Hare in the face
          since—knowing I hold the secret that would save her
          son from the hangman."</p>
  <p>"And put yourself in his place," sneered Sir Francis.</p>
  <p>"No. Put you."</p>
  <p>"That's as it might be. But, if I went to the hangman,
          you would go with me. There would be no excuse or
          escape for you. You know it."</p>
  <p>The warfare continued longer, but this was the cream of
          it. Mr. Dill heard the whole, and repeated it now to
          the magistrates. Mr. Rubiny protested that it was
          "inadmissable;" "hearsay evidence;" "contrary to
          law:" but the bench oracularly put Mr. Rubiny down,
            <pb n="190"/> and told him they did not require
          any stranger to come there and teach them their
          business.</p>
  <p>Colonel Bethel had leaned forward at the conclusion of
          Mr. Dill's evidence, dismay on his face, agitation
          in his voice. "Are you sure that you made no
          mistake? —that the other in this interview was Otway
          Bethel?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Dill sadly shook his head. "Am I one to swear to a
          wrong man, colonel? I wish I had not heard it —save
          that it may be the means of clearing Richard
          Hare."</p>
  <p>Sir Francis Levison had braved out the proceedings with a
          haughty, cavalier air, his delicate hands and his
          diamond ring remarkably conspicuous. Was that stone
          the real thing, or a false one substituted for the
          real? Hard up as he had long been for money, the
          suspicion might arise. A derisive smile crossed his
          features at parts of the evidence, as much as to
          say, You may convict me, as to Mademoiselle Afy; but
          you cannot, as to the murder. When, however, Mr.
          Dill's testimony was given, what a change was there!
          His mood tamed down to what looked like abject
          fear.</p>
  <p>"Of course your worships will take bail for Sir Francis,"
          said Mr. Rubiny, at the close of the
          proceedings.</p>
  <p>Bail! The bench looked at one another.</p>
  <p>"Your worships will not refuse it—a gentleman in Sir
          Francis Levison's position!"</p>
  <p>The bench thought they had never had so insolent an
          application made to them. Bail for him!—on this
          charge! No; not if the lord chancellor himself came
          down to offer it.</p>
  <p>Mr. Otway Bethel, conscious, probably, that nobody would
          offer bail for him, not even the colonel, did not
            <pb n="191"/> ask the bench to take it. So the two
          were fully committed to take their trial for the
          "Wilful murder, otherwise the killing and slaying,
          of George Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>And that vain, ill-starred Afy? What of her? Well, Afy
          had again retired to the witness-room after giving
          evidence, and there she remained till the close,
          agreeably occupied in a mental debate. What would
          they make out from her admissions regarding her
          sojourn in London and the morning calls? How would
          that precious West Lynne construe it? She did not
          much care; she should brave it out, and assail them
          with towering indignation, did any dare to cast a
          stone at her.</p>
  <p>Such was her final decision, arrived at just as the
          proceedings terminated. Afy was right glad to remain
          where she was till some of the bustle had gone.</p>
  <p>"How has it ended?" asked she of Mr. Ball, who, being a
          bachelor, was ever regarded with much graciousness
          by Afy, for she kept her eyes open to contingencies;
          although Mr. Joe Jiffin was held as a reserve.</p>
  <p>"They are both committed for wilful murder. Off to
          Lynneborough in an hour."</p>
  <p>Afy's choler rose. "What a shame! To commit two innocent
          men upon such a charge!"</p>
  <p>"I can tell you what, Miss Afy, the sooner you disabuse
          your mind of that prejudice, the better. Levison has
          been as good as proved guilty to-day; but, if proof
          were wanting, he and Bethel have criminated each
          other. 'When rogues fall out, honest men get their
          own.' Not that I can quite fathom Bethel's share in
          the exploit; though I can pretty well guess at it.
          And, in proving <pb n="192"/> themselves guilty,
          they have proved the innocence of Richard Hare."</p>
  <p>Afy's face was changing to whiteness; her confident air
          to one of dread; her vanity to humiliation.</p>
  <p>"It—can't—be—true!" she gasped.</p>
  <p>"It's true enough. The part you have hitherto ascribed to
          Thorn, was enacted by Richard Hare. He heard the
          shot from his place in the wood, and saw Thorn run,
          ghastly, trembling, horrified, from his wicked work.
          Believe me, it was Thorn who killed your
          father."</p>
  <p>Afy grew cold as she listened. That one awful moment,
          when conviction, that his words were true, forced
          itself upon her, was enough to sober her for a whole
          lifetime. <hi>Thorn!</hi> Her sight failed; her head
          reeled; her very heart turned to sickness. One
          struggling cry of pain; and, for the second time
          that day, Afy Hallijohn fell forward in a fainting
          fit.</p>
  <p>Shouts, hisses, execrations, yells! The prisoners were
          being brought forth to be conveyed to Lynneborough.
          A whole posse of constables was necessary to protect
          them against the outbreak of the mob, which outbreak
          was not directed against Otway Bethel, but against
          Sir Francis Levison. Cowering, like the guilty
          culprit that he was, he shivered, and hid his white
          face, wondering whether it would be a repetition of
          Justice Hare's green pond, or the tearing him
          asunder piecemeal; and cursing the earth because it
          did not open and let him in!</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVII. FIRE.</head>
  <p><hi>Miss Lucy</hi> was <hi>en pénitence</hi> . She had
          been guilty of some childish fault that day at Aunt
          Cornelia's, which, coming to the knowledge of Mrs.
          Carlyle after their return home, the young lady was
          ordered to the nursery for the rest of the day, to
          be regaled upon bread and water.</p>
  <p>Barbara was in her pleasant dressing-room. There was to
          be a dinner party at East Lynne that evening, and
          she had just finished dressing. Very lovely she
          looked in her dinner-dress, with purple and scarlet
          flowers, just plucked from the conservatory, in her
          hair, and a bonquet of scarlet and purple flowers in
          her bosom. She glanced at her watch somewhat
          anxiously, for the gentlemen had not made their
          appearance. Half past six! and they were to dine at
          seven.</p>
  <p>Madame Vine tapped at the door. Her errand was to beg
          grace for Lucy, who had been promised half an hour
          in the drawing-room, when the ladies entered it from
          the dessert-table, and was now in an agony of grief
          at the disappointment. Would Mrs. Carlyle pardon her
          and allow her to be dressed?</p>
  <p>"You are too lenient to that child, madame," said
          Barbara. "I don't think you ever would punish her at
            <pb n="194"/> all. But when she commits faults,
          they must be corrected."</p>
  <p>"She is very sorry for her fault; she promises not to be
          rude again. She is crying as if she would cry her
          heart out."</p>
  <p>"Not for her ill-behaviour, but because she is afraid of
          missing the drawing-room to-night," cried
          Barbara.</p>
  <p>"Do pray restore her to favour," pleaded madame.</p>
  <p>"I shall see. Just look, Madame Vine! I broke this, a
          minute or two ago. Is it not a pity?"</p>
  <p>Barbara held in her hand a beautiful toilette ornament,
          set in gold. One of the petals had come off.</p>
  <p>Madame Vine examined it. "I have some cement up-stairs
          that would join it," she exclaimed. "I could do it
          in two minutes."</p>
  <p>"Oh, I wish you would," was Barbara's delighted response.
          "Do bring the cement here and join it now. Shall I
          bribe you?" she added, laughing. "You make this all
          right, and then you shall bear back grace to
          Lucy—for I perceive that is what your heart is set
          upon."</p>
  <p>Madame Vine went, and returned with her cement. Barbara
          watched her, as she took the pieces in her hand, to
          see how the one must fit on to the other.</p>
  <p>"This has been broken once before, Joyce tells me,"
          Barbara said. "But it must have been imperceptibly
          joined, for I have looked in vain for the damage.
          Mr. Carlyle bought it for his first wife when they
          were in London after their marriage. She broke it.
          You will never do it, Madame Vine, if your hand
          shakes like that. What is the matter?"</p>
  <p>A great deal was the matter. First, the ominous words had
          been upon her tongue. "It was broken <pb n="195"/>
          here, where the stem joins the flower:" but she
          recollected herself in time. Next, came up the past
          vision of the place and hour when the accident
          occurred. Her sleeve had swept it off the table; Mr.
          Carlyle was in the room, this very room, and he had
          soothed her sorrow, her almost childish sorrow, with
          kisses sweet. Ah me! poor thing! I think our hands
          would have shaken as hers did. The ornament and the
          kisses were Barbara's now.</p>
  <p>"I ran quickly up the stairs and back again," was the
          explanation she offered to Mrs. Carlyle for her
          shaking hands.</p>
  <p>At that moment Mr. Carlyle and their guests were heard to
          return, and to ascend to their respective
          apartments, Lord Vane's gleeful voice echoing
          through the house. Mr. Carlyle came into his wife's
          dressing-room, and Madame Vine would have made a
          precipitate retreat.</p>
  <p>"No, no," said Barbara, "finish it now you have begun.
          Mr. Carlyle will be going to his own room. Look at
          the misfortune I have had, Archibald! I have broken
          this."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced carelessly at the trinket, and at
          Madame Vine's white fingers. He crossed to the door
          of his dressing-room and opened it, then held out
          his hand in silence for Barbara to approach, and
          drew her in with him. Madame Vine went on with her
          work.</p>
  <p>Presently Barbara returned: and approached the table,
          where stood Madame Vine, while she drew on her
          gloves. Her eyelashes were wet.</p>
  <p>"I could not help shedding a few tears for joy," said
          Barbara, perceiving that Madame Vine observed the
          signs. "Mr. Carlyle has been telling me that my
          brother's innocence is now all but patent to the
          world. <pb n="196"/> Lord Mount Severn was present
          at the proceedings, and says they have criminated
          each other. Papa sat in his place as chairman: I
          wonder that he liked to do so!"</p>
  <p>Lower bent the head of Madame Vine over her employment.
          "Has anything been proved against them?" she asked,
          in her usual soft tone, almost a whisper.</p>
  <p>"There is not the least doubt of the guilt of Levison,
          but Otway Bethel's share in the affair is a puzzle
          yet," replied Mrs. Carlyle. "Both are committed for
          trial. Oh, that man, that man! how his sins come
          out!" she continued, in excitement.</p>
  <p>Madame Vine glanced up through her spectacles.</p>
  <p>"Would you believe," continued Barbara, dropping her
          voice, "that while West Lynne, and I fear we
          ourselves, gave that miserable Afy credit for having
          gone away with Richard, she was, all the time, with
          Levison? Ball the lawyer got her to confess to it
          to-day. I am unacquainted with the details: Mr.
          Carlyle would not give them to me. He said the bare
          fact was quite enough."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was right.</p>
  <p>"Out it all seems to come, little by little! one
          wickedness after another!" resumed Barbara. "I do
          not like Mr. Carlyle to hear it. Of course there is
          no help for it; but he must feel it terribly; as
          must Lord Mount Severn. She <hi>was</hi> his wife,
          you know, and the children are hers: and to think
          that she—I mean he must feel it <hi>for her</hi> ,"
          went on Barbara after her sudden pause, and there
          was some hauteur in her tone, lest she should be
          misunderstood. "Mr. Carlyle is one of the very few
          men, so entirely noble, whom the sort of disgrace,
          reflected from Lady Isabel's conduct, cannot
          touch."</p>
  <p>The carriage of the first guest. Barbara ran across <pb n="197"/> the room, and rattled at Mr. Carlyle's
          door. "Archibald! do you hear?"</p>
  <p>Back came the laughing answer. "I shan't keep them long.
          But they may surely accord a few minutes' grace to a
          man who has just been converted into an M.P."</p>
  <p>Barbara descended to the drawing-room. Leaving that
          unhappy lady to the cement and the broken pieces,
          and to battle as she best could with her breaking
          heart. Nothing but stabs; nothing but stabs! Was her
          punishment ever to end? No. The step she had taken,
          in coming back to East Lynne, precluded that.</p>
  <p>The guests arrived. All save Mr. and Mrs. Hare. Barbara
          received a note from her mamma instead. The justice
          did not feel well enough to join them.</p>
  <p>I should think he did not. If retribution came home
          sharply to Lady Isabel, it was coming home in some
          degree to him. Richard, his own unoffending son—
          unoffending in every sense of the term, until that
          escapade of falling in love with Afy—had been
          treated with unnatural harshness. West Lynne and the
          public would not fail to remember it—and the justice
          was remarkably alive to West Lynne and the public's
          opinion. The affection for Richard, which the
          justice had been pressing down and keeping under,
          and turning into all possible channels of hate, was
          now returning in unpleasant force. Unpleasant, in so
          far as that it did savage war with his
          conscience.</p>
  <p>"I—I—might have hunted him to death, you know, Anne,"
          said the justice, sitting in his chair, and wiping
          his brows, and eating humble pie for perhaps the
          first time in his life.</p>
  <p>"But it is over now, Richard dear," said gentle <pb n="198"/> loving Mrs. Hare, the happy tears
          coursing down her cheeks.</p>
  <p>"But I <hi>might</hi> —had he made his appearance here.
          In fact, I should."</p>
  <p>"Do not grieve, Richard; it will not recall the past. In
          a little time we may have him home again with us;
          and then we can both make it up to him."</p>
  <p>"And how are we to get him here? He may be dead. Who
          knows where he is? He may be dead, I say."</p>
  <p>"No, he is not. We shall get him when the time comes. Mr.
          Carlyle knows where he is; has known a long while,
          he told me to-day: even sees him sometimes. A true
          friend to us all Richard, is Archibald Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Ay. That jade, Barbara, is in luck. I shouldn't be
          surprised but what she knows too; if he does. A good
          girl, a good girl, though she puts up at times for
          saucy independence."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hare could scarcely make her husband out, his tone
          and manner were so thoroughly changed from what she
          had ever known them.</p>
  <p>"But I can't believe it's true yet, Anne. I can't indeed.
          If he is innocent, why couldn't he have been cleared
          before? It is so many years ago, you know! Do you
          think he is innocent?"</p>
  <p>"Dear Richard, I know he is," she answered, with a happy
          smile. "I have been sure of it a long, long while.
          And so has Mr. Carlyle."</p>
  <p>"Well, that's something. Carlyle's judgment is. Is his
          room aired—and all that?"</p>
  <p>"Whose room?" echoed Mrs. Hare.</p>
  <p>"Poor Dick's."</p>
  <pb n="199"/>
  <p>"My dear, you forget," she returned, in wonderment. "He
          cannot come home yet; not until after the assizes.
          The others must be proved guilty, and he innocent,
          before he can come home."</p>
  <p>"True, true," said Mr. Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>A pleasant party, it was, at East Lynne: and twelve
          o'clock struck before the carriage of the last guest
          drove away. It might have been one to two hours
          after that, and the house was steeped in moonlight
          and quietness, everybody being a-bed and asleep,
          when a loud, alarming summons at the hall bell
          echoed through the stillness.</p>
  <p>The first to put her head out at a window, was Wilson.
          "Is it fire?" shrieked she, in the most excessive
          state of terror conceivable. Wilson had a natural
          dread of fire; some people possess this dread more
          than others; and had oftentime aroused the house to
          a commotion by declaring she smelt it. "Is it fire?"
          shrieked Wilson.</p>
  <p>" <hi>Yes</hi> ," was shouted at the very top of a man's
          voice, who stepped from between the entrance pillars
          to answer.</p>
  <p>Wilson waited for no more. Clutching at the baby with one
          hand—a fine young gentleman now of near twelve
          months' old, promising fair to be as great a source
          of trouble to Wilson and the nursery as was his
          brother Archibald, whom he greatly resembled— and at
          Archie with the other, out she flew to the corridor,
          screeching "Fire! fire! fire!" in every accent of
          horror. Into William's room, and dragging him out of
          bed; into Lucy's, and dragging her; banging open the
          door of Madame Vine, and the shrieks, Fire! fire!
          fire! never ceasing; Wilson, with the four children,
            <pb n="200"/> burst unceremoniously into the
          sleeping apartment of Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle. By this
          time, the children, terrified out of their senses,
          not at Wilson's cry of alarm, but at the summary
          propelling down stairs, set up a shrieking too.
          Madame Vine, believing that half of the house at
          least was in flames, was the next to appear,
          throwing on a shawl she had caught up: and then came
          Joyce.</p>
  <p>"Fire! fire! fire!" shouted Wilson; "we're all a-being
          burnt up together."</p>
  <p>Poor Mrs. Carlyle, thus wildly aroused from sleep, sprang
          out of bed and into the corridor in her night-dress.
          Everybody else was in a night-dress: when folks are
          flying for dear life, they don't stop to look for
          their dress-coats, and best blonde caps. Out came
          Mr. Carlyle, who had hastily assumed his
          pantaloons.</p>
  <p>He cast a rapid glance down to the hall, and saw that the
          stairs were perfectly free for escape: therefore the
          hurry was not so violent. Every soul around him was
          shrieking in concert, making the confusion and din
          terrific. The bright moonlight streamed in at the
          corridor windows, but there was no other light.</p>
  <p>"Where is the fire?" he exclaimed. "I don't smell any.
          Who first gave the alarm?"</p>
  <p>The bell answered him. The hall bell, which rang out ten
          times louder and longer than before. He opened one
          of the windows and leaned from it. "Who's there?"
          Madame Vine caught up Archie.</p>
  <p>"It's me, sir," responded a voice, which he at once
          recognised to be that of one of Mr. Hare's
          men-servants. "Master have been took in a fit, sir,
          and mistress sent me for you and Miss Barbara. You
          must please make haste, sir, if you want to see him
          alive." Miss Barbara! <pb n="201"/> It was more
          familiar to Jasper, in a moment of excitement, than
          the new name.</p>
  <p>"You, Jasper! Is the house on fire? This house?"</p>
  <p>"Well, I don't know, sir. I can hear a dreadful deal of
          screeching in it."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle closed the window. He began to suspect that
          the danger lay in fear alone. "Who told you there
          was fire?" he demanded of Wilson.</p>
  <p>"That man ringing at the door," sobbed Wilson. "Thank
          goodness, I have saved the children."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle felt somewhat exasperated at the mistake. His
          wife was trembling from head to foot; and he knew
          that she was not in a condition to be alarmed,
          necessarily or unnecessarily. She clung to him in
          terror, asking if they <hi>could</hi> escape.</p>
  <p>"My darling, be calm! There is no fire. It is a stupid
          mistake. You may all go back to bed and sleep in
          peace," he added to the rest. "And the next time
          that you alarm the house in the night, Wilson, have
          the goodness to make yourself sure, first of all,
          that there's cause for it."</p>
  <p>Barbara, frightened still, bewildered and uncertain,
          escaped to the window, and threw it open. But Mr.
          Carlyle was nearly as quick as she: he caught her to
          him with one hand, and drew the window down with the
          other. To have these tidings told to her abruptly,
          would be worse than all. By this time, some of the
          servants had descended the other staircase, with a
          light (being in various stages of costume); and,
          hastening to open the hall door, Jasper entered. The
          man had probably waited to help put out the "fire."
          Barbara caught sight of him ere Mr. Carlyle could
          prevent it, and grew <pb n="202"/> sick with fear,
          believing some ill had happened to her mother.</p>
  <p>Drawing her inside their chamber, he broke the news to
          her soothingly and tenderly, making light of it. She
          burst into tears. "You are not deceiving me,
          Archibald? Papa is not dead?"</p>
  <p>"Dead!" cheerily echoed Mr. Carlyle, in the same tone he
          might have used had Barbara wondered whether the
          justice was taking a night airing for pleasure in a
          balloon. "Wilson has indeed frightened you, love.
          Dress yourself, and we will go and see him."</p>
  <p>At that moment, Barbara recollected William. Strange that
          she should be the first to do so; before Lady
          Isabel, before Mr. Carlyle. She ran out again to the
          corridor, where the boy stood shivering. "He may
          have caught his death!" she uttered, snatching him
          up in her arms. "Oh, Wilson! what have you done? His
          night-gown is damp and cold."</p>
  <p>Unfit as she was for the burden, she bore him to her own
          bed. Wilson was not at leisure to attend to
          reproaches just then. She was engaged in a wordy war
          with Jasper, leaning over the balustrades to carry
          it on.</p>
  <p>"I never told you there was a fire!" indignantly denied
          Jasper.</p>
  <p>"You did. I opened the nursery window, and called out 'Is
          it fire?' and you answered 'Yes.'"</p>
  <p>"You called out 'Is it Jasper?' What else should I say
          but 'Yes,' to that? Fire! Where was the fire likely
          to be? In the park?"</p>
  <p>"Wilson, take the children back to bed," authoritatively
          said Mr. Carlyle, as he advanced to look down into
          the hall. "John, are you there? the close carriage
          instantly. Be quick. Madame Vine, pray don't <pb n="203"/> continue to hold that heavy boy. Joyce,
          cannot you relieve madame?"</p>
  <p>In crossing back to his room, Mr. Carlyle had brushed
          past madame, and noticed that she appeared to be
          shaking, as if with the weight of Archibald. In
          reality, she was still alarmed, not understanding
          yet the cause of the commotion. Joyce, who
          comprehended it as little, and had stood with her
          arms round Lucy, advanced to take Archibald; and Mr.
          Carlyle disappeared. Barbara had taken off her own
          night-dress then, and put it upon William in place
          of his own, had struck a light, and was busily
          dressing herself.</p>
  <p>"Just feel his night-gown, Archibald! Wilson—"</p>
  <p>A shrill cry of awful terror interrupted the words, and
          Mr. Carlyle made but one bound out again. Barbara
          followed: the least she thought, was, that Wilson
          had dropped the baby into the hall.</p>
  <p>That was not the catastrophe. Wilson, with the baby and
          Lucy, had already disappeared up the staircase, and
          Madame Vine was disappearing. Archibald lay on the
          soft carpet of the corridor, where madame had stood;
          for Joyce, in the act of taking him, had let him
          slip to the ground, let him fall, from sheer terror.
          She held on by the balustrades, her face ghastly,
          her mouth open, her eyes fixed in horror; altogether
          an object to look upon. Archie gathered himself on
          to his sturdy legs, and stood staring.</p>
  <p>"Why, Joyce! what is the matter with <hi>you?</hi> "
          cried Mr. Carlyle. "You look as if you had seen a
          spectre."</p>
  <p>"Oh, master!" she wailed, "I <hi>have</hi> seen one."</p>
  <p>"Are you all going deranged together?" retorted he <pb n="204"/> wondering what had come to the house.
          "Seen a spectre? Joyce!"</p>
  <p>Joyce fell on her knees, as if unable to support herself,
          and crossed her shaking hands upon her chest. Had
          she seen ten spectres, she could not have betrayed
          more dire distress. She was a sensible and faithful
          servant, one not given to flights of fancy, and Mr.
          Carlyle gazed at her in very amazement.</p>
  <p>"Joyce, what is this?" he asked, bending down and
          speaking kindly.</p>
  <p>"Oh, my dear master! Heaven have mercy upon us all!" was
          the inexplicable answer.</p>
  <p>"Joyce, I ask you, what is this?"</p>
  <p>She made no reply. She rose up, shaking; and taking
          Archie's hand, slowly proceeded towards the upper
          stairs, low moans breaking from her, and the boy's
          naked feet pattering on the carpet.</p>
  <p>"What can ail her?" whispered Barbara, following Joyce
          with her eyes. "What did she mean, about a
          spectre?"</p>
  <p>"She must have been reading a ghost-book," said Mr.
          Carlyle. "Wilson's folly has turned the house
          topsy-turvy. Make haste, Barbara."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XVIII. THREE MONTHS LONGER.</head>
  <p><hi>Spring</hi> waned. Summer came, and would soon be
          waning, too, for the hot days of July were now in.
          What had the months brought forth, since the
          election of Mr. Carlyle in April? Be you very sure
          they had not been without their events.</p>
  <p>Mr. Justice Hare's illness had turned out to be a stroke
          of paralysis. People cannot act with unnatural
          harshness towards a child, and then discover they
          have been in the wrong, with impunity. Thus it
          proved with Justice Hare. He was recovering, but
          would never again be the man he had been. The
          fright, when Jasper had gone to tell of his illness
          at East Lynne, and was mistaken for fire, had done
          nobody any damage, save William and Joyce. William
          had caught a cold, which brought increased malady to
          the lungs; and Joyce seemed to have caught
            <hi>fear</hi> . She went about, more like one in a
          dream than awake, would be buried in a reverie for
          an hour at a time, and, if suddenly spoken to, would
          start and shiver.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle and his wife departed for London, immediately
          that Mr. Hare was pronounced out of danger; which
          was in about a week from the time of his seizure.
          William accompanied them: partly for the benefit of
            <pb n="206"/> London advice, partly because Mr.
          Carlyle would not be parted from him. Joyce went, in
          attendance, with some of the other servants.</p>
  <p>They found London ringing with the news of Sir Francis
          Levison's arrest. London could not understand it:
          and the most wild and improbable tales were in
          circulation. The season was at its height; the
          excitement in proportion; it was more than a nine
          day's wonder. On the very evening of their arrival,
          a lady, young and beautiful, was shown into the
          presence of Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle. She had declined
          to give her name, but there arose to Mr. Carlyle's
          memory, when he looked on her, one whom he had seen
          in earlier days, as a friend of his first wife:
          Blanche Challoner. It was not Blanche, however.</p>
  <p>The stranger looked keenly at Mr. Carlyle. He was
          standing with his hat in his hand, on the point of
          going out. "Will you pardon this intrusion?" she
          asked. "I have come to you, as one human being, in
          need, comes to crave help of another. I am Lady
          Levison."</p>
  <p>Barbara's face flushed. Mr. Carlyle courteously invited
          the stranger to a chair, and remained standing
          himself. She sat for a moment, and then rose
          evidently in an excess of agitation.</p>
  <p>"Yes, I am Lady Levison. Forced to call that man husband.
          That he has been a wicked man, I have long known;
          but now, I hear he is a criminal. I hear it, I say,
          but I can get the truth from none. I went to Lord
          Mount Severn; he declined to give me particulars. I
          heard that Mr. Carlyle would be in town as to-day;
          and I resolved to come and ask them of him."</p>
  <p>She delivered the sentences in a jerking, abrupt tone,
            <pb n="207"/> betraying her inward emotion. Mr.
          Carlyle made no immediate reply.</p>
  <p>"You and I have both been deeply wronged by him, Mr.
          Carlyle. But I brought my wrong upon myself: you did
          not. My sister Blanche, whom he had cruelly
          treated—and, if I speak of it, I only speak of what
          is known to the world—warned me against him. Mrs.
          Levison, his grandmother, that ancient lady, who
          must now be bordering upon ninety, warned me also.
          The night before my wedding-day, she came on purpose
          to tell me that if I married Francis Levison I
          should rue it for life: there was yet time to
          retract, she said. Yes; there was time; but there
          was no <hi>will</hi> . I would not listen to either:
          I was led away by vanity, by folly, by something
          worse—the triumph over my own sister. Poor Blanche!
          And I have a child," she continued, dropping her
          voice; "a boy who inherits his father's name. Mr.
          Carlyle"—bending forward and clasping her hands,
          while her face looked like one carved from
          stone—"will they <hi>condemn</hi> him?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing, as yet, is positively proved against him,"
          replied Mr. Carlyle, compassionately.</p>
  <p>"If I could but get a divorce!" she cried passionately,
          apparently losing all self-control. "I might have
          got one, over and over again, since we married; but
          there would have been the <hi>exposé</hi> and the
          scandal. If I could but change my child's name! Tell
          me— does any chance of redress remain for me?"</p>
  <p>There was none: and Mr. Carlyle did not attempt to speak
          of any. He said a few kind words of sympathy, and
          prepared to go out. She moved, and stood in his
          way.</p>
  <p>"You will not leave until you have given me the <pb n="208"/> particulars! I pray you, do not! I came
          trustingly to you, hoping to know them."</p>
  <p>"I have to keep an important engagement," he answered;
          "and, even if it were not so, I should decline to
          tell them to you; on my own account, as well as on
          yours. Lay not discourtesy to my charge, Lady
          Levison: but if I were to speak of the man, even to
          you, his name would blister my lips."</p>
  <p>"In every word of hate, spoken by you, I should
          sympathise; every contemptuous expression of scorn,
          cast upon him from your heart, I would re-echo."</p>
  <p>Barbara was shocked. "He is your husband, after all," she
          whispered.</p>
  <p>"My husband!" burst out Lady Levison passionately. "Yes,
          there is the wrong he has done me! Why— knowing what
          he was, and what he had done—why did he delude me
          into becoming his wife? You ought to feel pity for
          me Mrs. Carlyle, and you do feel it, for you are a
          wife and a mother. How dare these bad men marry!"
          she cried, incoherently. "Were his other sins not
          hindrance enough, but with crime also on his
          conscience he must come with his bold face to woo me
          with lies! He has done me deep, irremediable wrong,
          and he has entailed upon his child an inheritance of
          shame which can never be thrown off."</p>
  <p>Barbara was half frightened at her vehemence: but Barbara
          might be thankful that she could not understand it.
          All Lady Levison's native gentleness, all her
          reticence of feeling, as a wife and a gentlewoman,
          had been goaded out of her. The process had been
          going on for some time, this last revelation was the
          crowning point, and Alice, Lady Levison, turned
          round upon the world in her helpless resentment, as
          vehemently as any <pb n="209"/> poor charwoman might
          have done. There are certain wrongs which bring out
          human nature in the high and the low alike. "Still,
          he is your husband," was all Barbara could, with
          deprecation, again plead.</p>
  <p>"He made himself my husband by deceit, and I will throw
          him off in the face of day," returned Lady Levison.
          "There is no moral obligation why I should not. He
          has worked ill and ruin, ill and ruin upon me and my
          child; and the world shall not think I have borne my
          share in it. How was it you kept your hands off him,
          when he reappeared, to brave you, in West Lynne?"
          she added, in a changed tone, turning to Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I cannot tell. It was a marvel oftentimes to
          myself."</p>
  <p>He quitted the room as he spoke, adding a few kind-spoken
          words about leaving her with Mrs. Carlyle. When they
          were alone, Barbara yielded to Lady Levison's
          request, and gave her the outline of the dark tale.
          Its outline only: generously suppressing Afy's name
          beyond the evening of the fatal event. Lady Levison
          listened without interruption.</p>
  <p>"Do you and Mr. Carlyle believe him to have been
          guilty?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Was his first wife, Isabel Vane, mad?" she presently
          asked.</p>
  <p>'Mad?' echoed Barbara, in surprise.</p>
  <p>"When she quitted him for the other. It could have been
          nothing less than madness. I could understand a
          woman's flying from Francis Levison for love of Mr.
          Carlyle; but, now that I have seen your husband, I
          cannot understand the reverse."</p>
  <pb n="210"/>
  <p>And, without another word, Alice Levison quitted the room
          as abruptly as she had entered it.</p>
  <p>Barbara's stay in London was little more than three
          weeks, for it was necessary she should be safe at
          home again.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle, however, remained in town till the session
          was nearly over, though he made hurried visits down
          to East Lynne. In July, he returned home for good.
          There was another baby at East Lynne then, a lovely
          little lady—pretty as Barbara herself had been at a
          month old.</p>
  <p>But William was rapidly fading away. The London physician
          had confirmed Dr. Martin's opinion; and it was
          evident to all that the end could not be long in
          coming.</p>
  <p>Somebody else was fading—Lady Isabel. The cross had been
          too heavy, and she was sinking under its weight. Can
          you wonder at it? It might have been different had
          she yielded to its weight; striven to <hi>bear</hi>
          it in patience and in silence, after the manner she
          had carved out for herself. But she did not. She
          rebelled against it: and it was costing her her
          life. The hourly and daily excitement, arising from
          the false position in which she had placed herself
          by returning to East Lynne, calmed down with the
          departure of Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle for town. Then the
          reaction set in. The incessant irritation on the
          mind, the feelings, and the nerves was gone; but in
          its place had settled the no less dangerous apathy,
          the dull quiet of despair. It was the excitement
          which had kept her up: and, that over, she began to
          sink with alarming rapidity. There appeared to be no
          ostensible disease, but she was wasting away day by
          day; as her mother had done. Her fading <pb n="211"/> was observed by none; and she still discharged
          her duties as Lucy's governess: though she snatched
          portions of her time to spend with William. Was she
          conscious of her own decay? Partially so: and, had
          anybody inquired what her malady was, would have
          answered, A broken heart.</p>
  <p>An intensely hot day it was, under the July sun. Afy
          Hallijohn was sailing up the street in its beams,
          finer and vainer than ever. Afy had not shone out
          particularly clear in the eyes of West Lynne, after
          that examination. Besides the little episode,
          touching the London visit, Afy stood convicted, if
          not of perjury, of something very like it. It is
          true, that when the coroner's inquest on her father
          took place, she was not sworn to the truth of her
          evidence; and Richard Hare was mistaken, in
          believing that she was. She had been asserted that
          nobody was at the cottage that night but Richard
          Hare, for she would not mention Thorn's name. Not
          that she had the remotest suspicion that he had
          anything to do with the tragedy; we must give her
          her due there; she did fully believe Richard Hare
          was guilty. Afy on that point but spoke as she
          believed. But when she was put upon her oath before
          the magistrates, she was compelled to convict
          herself of falsehood in other matters.</p>
  <p>All this told badly at West Lynne, and Afy in public
          opinion became as graceless as ever. She stoutly
          stood up for herself: to listen to her you would
          have believed her a heroine immaculate; and some
          were convinced, and espoused her cause. Not so Mrs.
          Latimer. Her faith was shaken. She discharged Afy,
          according her, however, the favour of a month's
          warning, which took off the chief stigma of the
          disgrace. Amongst her warmest <pb n="212"/>
          advocates was Mr. Joe Jiffin. Somewhat dubious when
          the startling news came out, he suffered himself to
          be wholly talked over by Afy. She made her tale
          thoroughly good to him, and, in the ardour of the
          moment, Mr. Jiffin laid himself, his hand, and his
          cheesemongery at Afy's feet. Had a veritable saint
          come forth out of the world of spirits to testify
          against Afy, Mr. Jiffin would have turned a deaf ear
          from that time forth.</p>
  <p>Who so proud now as Afy?—who so scornfully triumphant
          over West Lynne? She went into respectable lodgings,
          and began making her preparations, in the shape of
          fine bonnets and gowns. Handsome lodgings, and
          positively within sight of the windows of Miss
          Carlyle. Here Afy was the lady, and here Mr. Joe
          Jiffin was permitted the favour of an occasional
          evening visit, some female friend or other, of
          Afy's, being always present to play propriety.
          Indeed, you might have thought she had just emerged
          from a convent of nuns, so over scrupulous was she.
          "Wretches!" ejaculated Mr. Jiffin, apostrophising
          West Lynne and its malicious gossipers, "she's as
          particular and innocent as an angel."</p>
  <p>Afy was sailing up the street in the July sun. She
          surveyed the house of Mr. Joe Jiffin with
          satisfaction as she passed it, for it was being
          embellished outside and in, to receive her; while
          packages of new furniture were arriving by every
          train. She threw out hints, and the enraptured
          bridegroom-elect acted upon them. He saw her from
          his shop, and came rushing out.</p>
  <p>"They are getting on so well, Miss Afy! It will all be
          finished this week. The drawing-room paper is hung,
          and looks beautiful. The gold border is exquisite.
            <pb n="213"/> Would you like to step up-stairs
          with me and look at it?"</p>
  <p>"Oh dear!" responded the shocked Afy. "Go upstairs with
          you, Mr. Jiffin! Has not West Lynne been ill natured
          enough already? You don't understand these
          things."</p>
  <p>"I'm afraid I don't," meekly responded the poor little
          man. "I'm sure I beg your pardon, Miss Afy. I meant
          no offence."</p>
  <p>"I wish <hi>to goodness</hi> ," resumed Afy, with
          emphasis, "you'd leave off those white badges of
          aprons!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Jiffin coughed in perplexity. It was a sore and
          difficult point. "I'd do almost anything you asked
          me, Miss Afy; you know I would: but only think how I
          should grease my—my—lower garments!"</p>
  <p>Afy gave a shriek, and turned her modest cheeks the other
          way.</p>
  <p>"Not to speak of my waistcoats," went on Mr. Jiffin, all
          in dire confusion; "but they'd come in for a touch
          of it. There's the work with the tubs of butter, and
          the cutting up of the bacon and hams, and the dirt
          off the cheeses, and the splashings from the pickled
          pork barrels: it's all greasy together. Besides the
          squashing of an egg now and then, which nobody can
          help. I assure you, Miss Afy, if I were to discard
          my aprons, I might put on a new pair
          of—articles—every week, and not be decent in front
          then."</p>
  <p>Afy groaned. Whether at the delicacy of the subject, or
          the wholesale destruction hinted at, Mr. Jiffin did
          not know.</p>
  <p>"You go to Lynneborough by the early train tomorrow,
          don't you, Miss Afy?" asked he, by way of changing
          the topic.</p>
  <pb n="214"/>
  <p>"Everybody knows that," said Afy. "A good many of us go.
          The trial comes on at nine, so of course it's
          necessary to be there early. Have you heard the
          rumour, about Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>"No," replied Mr. Jiffin. "What rumour is it?"</p>
  <p>"It is circulating through West Lynne. They say he is to
          be tried also."</p>
  <p>"Is he found?" cried Mr. Jiffin in surprise.</p>
  <p>"I don't know anything about it, myself. It has been said
          lately that he was dead, you know. As to which is
          guilty, he or Levison, I don't think it much
          matters," pursned Afy, with a lofty toss of the
          head, and a severe countenance. "My opinion always
          was that they were a couple of bad ones, two I
          wouldn't have touched with a long pole."</p>
  <p>Afy sailed away, her crinoline sweeping each side of the
          wide pavement. If she purposed sporting that
          crinoline in the crowded assize court on the morrow,
          it would inevitably come to grief. A few steps
          farther, she encountered Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"So, Afy? You are really going to be married at
          last!"</p>
  <p>"Jiffin fancies so, sir. I am not sure yet but what I
          shall change my mind. Jiffin thinks there's nobody
          like me: if I could eat gold and silver, he'd
          provide it; and he's as fond as fond can be. But
          then, you know, sir, he's half soft."</p>
  <p>"Soft, as to you, perhaps," laughed Mr. Carlyle. "I
          consider him a very civil, respectable man,
          Afy."</p>
  <p>"And then, I never did think to marry a shopkeeper,"
          grumbled Afy. "I looked a little higher than that.
          Only fancy, sir, having a husband who wears a white
          apron tied round him!"</p>
  <pb n="215"/>
  <p>"Terrible!" responded Mr. Carlyle, with a grave face.</p>
  <p>"Not but what it will be a tolerable settlement,"
          rejoined Afy, veering round a point. "He is having
          his house done up in style: and I shall keep two
          good servants, and do nothing, myself, but dress,
          and subscribe to the library. He makes plenty of
          money."</p>
  <p>"A very tolerable settlement, I should say," returned Mr.
          Carlyle: and Afy's face fell before the glance of
          his eye, merry though it was. "Take care you don't
          spend all his money for him, Afy."</p>
  <p>"I'll take care of that," nodded Afy, significantly.
          "Sir," she somewhat abruptly added, "what is it
          that's the matter with Joyce?"</p>
  <p>"I do not know," said Mr. Carlyle, becoming serious.
          "There does appear to be something the matter with
          her, for she is much changed."</p>
  <p>"I never saw anybody so changed in my life," exclaimed
          Afy. "I told her, the other day, that she was just
          like one who had got some dreadful secret upon the
          mind."</p>
  <p>"It is really more like that than anything else,"
          observed Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"But she's one of the close ones, is Joyce," continued
          Afy. "No fear that she'll give out a clue, if it
          does not suit her to do so. She told me, in answer,
          to mind my own business, and not to take absurd
          fancies in my head. How is the baby, sir? And Mrs.
          Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"All well. Good day, Afy."</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XIX. THE TRIAL.</head>
  <p><hi>Spacious</hi> courts were the assize courts of
          Lynneborough. And it was well they were so:
          otherwise more people had been disappointed, and
          numbers were, of hearing the noted trial of Sir
          Francis Levison for the murder of George
          Hallijohn.</p>
  <p>The circumstances attending the case caused it to bear
          for the public an unparalleled interest. The rank of
          the accused, and his antecedents, more especially
          that particular, local antecedent touching the Lady
          Isabel Carlyle; the verdict still out against
          Richard Hare; the length of time which had elapsed;
          the part played in it by Afy; the intense curiosity
          as to the part taken in it by Otway Bethel; the
          speculation as to what had been the exact details,
          and the doubt of a conviction; all contributed to
          fan the curiosity of the public. People came from
          far and near to be present. Friends of Mr. Carlyle,
          friends of the Hares, friends of the Challoner
          family, friends of the prisoner; besides the general
          public. Colonel Bethel, and Mr. Justice Hare, had
          conspicuous seats.</p>
  <p>At a few minutes past nine the judge took his place on
          the bench. But not before a rumour had gone <pb n="217"/> through the court: a rumour that seemed
          to shake it to its centre, and which people
          stretched out their necks to hear. Otway Bethel had
          turned Queen's evidence, and was to be admitted as
          witness for the crown.</p>
  <p>Thin, haggard, pale, looked Francis Levison as he was
          placed in the dock. His incarceration had not in any
          way contributed to his personal advantages: and
          there was an ever-recurring expression of dread upon
          his countenance, not pleasant to look upon. He was
          dressed in black, and his diamond ring shone
          conspicuous still on his white hand, now whiter than
          ever. The most eminent counsel were engaged on both
          sides.</p>
  <p>The testimony of the witnesses, already given, need not
          be recapitulated. The identification of the prisoner
          with the man Thorn was fully established. Ebenezer
          James proved that. Afy proved it; and also that he,
          Thorn, was at the cottage that night. Sir Peter
          Levison's groom was likewise re-examined. But still
          there wanted other testimony. Afy was made to
          reassert that Thorn had to go to the cottage for his
          hat, after leaving her: but that proved nothing: and
          the conversation, or quarrel, overheard by Mr. Dill,
          was not again put forward. If this was all the
          evidence, people opined that the case for the
          prosecution would break down.</p>
  <p>"Call Richard Hare," said the counsel for the
          prosecution.</p>
  <p>Those present, who knew Mr. Justice Hare, looked up at
          him; wondering why he did not stir, in answer to his
          name; wondering at the pallid hue which overspread
          his face. Not <hi>he</hi> , but another man came
          forward; a fair, placid young man, with blue eyes,
          fair <pb n="218"/> hair, and a pleasant countenance.
          It was Richard Hare the younger. He had resumed his
          original position in life, so far as attire went,
          and in that, at least, was a gentleman again: in
          speech also. With his working dress, Richard had
          thrown off his working manners.</p>
  <p>A strange hubbub arose in court. Richard Hare the exile!
          the reported dead! the man whose life was still in
          jeopardy! The spectators rose with one accord to get
          a better view; they stood on tiptoe; they pushed
          forth their necks; they strained their eyesight:
          and, amidst all the noisy hum, the groan, bursting
          from the lips of Justice Hare, was unnoticed. Whilst
          order was called for, and the judge threatened to
          clear the court, two officers moved quietly up and
          stood behind the witness. Richard Hare was in
          custody: though he might know it not. The witness
          was sworn.</p>
  <p>"What is your name?"</p>
  <p>"Richard Hare."</p>
  <p>"Son of Mr. Justice Hare, I believe; of the Grove, West
          Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"His only son."</p>
  <p>"The same against whom a verdict of wilful murder is
          out?" interposed the judge.</p>
  <p>"The same, my lord," replied Richard Hare, who appeared,
          strange as it may seem, to have cast away all his
          old fearfulness.</p>
  <p>"Then, witness, let me warn you that you are not obliged
          to answer any question that might tend to criminate
          yourself."</p>
  <p>"My lord," answered Richard Hare, with some emotion, "I
          wish to answer any and every question put to me. I
          have but one hope: that the full truth of all <pb n="219"/> pertaining to that fatal evening may be
          made manifest this day."</p>
  <p>"Look round at the prisoner," said the examining counsel.
          "Do you know him?"</p>
  <p>"I know him now as Sir Francis Levison. Up to April last,
          I believed his name to be Thorn."</p>
  <p>"State what occurred on the evening of the murder —so far
          as your knowledge goes."</p>
  <p>"I had an appointment that evening with Afy Hallijohn,
          and went down to their cottage to keep it—"</p>
  <p>"A moment," interrupted the counsel. "Was your visit that
          evening made in secret?"</p>
  <p>"Partially so. My father and mother were displeased at my
          intimacy with Afy Hallijohn: therefore, I did not
          care that they should be cognisant of my visits
          there. I am ashamed to confess that I told my father
          a lie over it that very evening. He saw me leave the
          dinner-table to go out with my gun, and inquired
          where I was off to. I answered, that I was going out
          with young Beauchamp."</p>
  <p>"When, in point of fact, you were not?"</p>
  <p>"No. I took my gun, for I had promised to lend it to
          Hallijohn, while his own was being repaired. When I
          reached the cottage, Afy refused to admit me: she
          was busy, she said. I felt sure she had Thorn with
          her. She had, more than once before, refused to
          admit me when I had gone there by her own
          appointment; and I always found that Thorn's
          presence in the cottage was the obstacle."</p>
  <p>"I suppose you and Thorn were jealous of each other?"</p>
  <p>"I was jealous of him: I freely admit it. I don't know
          whether he was of me."</p>
  <pb n="220"/>
  <p>"May I inquire what was the nature of your friendship for
          Miss Afy Hallijohn?"</p>
  <p>"I loved her with an honourable love: as I might have
          loved any young lady in my own station of life. I
          would not have married her in opposition to my
          father and mother: but I told Afy that if she was
          content to wait for me, until I was my own master, I
          would then make her my wife."</p>
  <p>"You had no views towards her of a different nature?"</p>
  <p>"None. I cared for her too much for that. And I respected
          her father. Afy's mother had been a lady, too;
          although she had married Hallijohn, who was but
          clerk to Mr. Carlyle. No: I never had a thought of
          wrong towards Afy.</p>
  <p>"Now relate the occurrences of the evening."</p>
  <p>"Afy would not admit me, and we had a few words over it.
          But at length I went away; first giving her the gun
          and telling her it was loaded. She lodged it against
          the wall, just inside the door, and I went into the
          wood and waited, determined to see whether, or not,
          Thorn was with her, for she had denied that he was.
          Locksley saw me there, and asked why I was hiding. I
          did not answer; but I went farther off, quite out of
          view of the cottage. Some time afterwards, less than
          half an hour, I heard a shot in the direction of the
          cottage. Somebody was having a late shot at the
          partridges, I thought. Just then, I saw Otway Bethel
          emerge from the trees not far from me, and run
          towards the cottage. My lord," added Richard Hare,
          looking at the judge, "that was the shot that killed
          Hallijohn."</p>
  <p>"Could the shot," asked the counsel, "have been fired by
          Otway Bethel?"</p>
  <pb n="221"/>
  <p>"It could not. It was much farther off. Bethel
          disappeared: and, in another minute, there came one,
          flying down the path leading from the cottage. It
          was Thorn: in a state of intense terror. His face
          was livid, his eyes staring, and he panted and shook
          like one in the ague. Past me he tore, on down the
          path, and I afterwards heard the sound of his horse
          galloping away. It had been tied in the wood."</p>
  <p>"Did you follow him?"</p>
  <p>"No. I wondered what had happened to put him in that
          state: but I made haste to the cottage, intending to
          reproach Afy with her duplicity. I leaped up the two
          steps, and fell over the prostrate body of
          Hallijohn. He was lying dead, within the door. My
          gun, just discharged, was flung on the floor, its
          contents in Hallijohn's side."</p>
  <p>You might have heard a pin drop in court, so intense was
          the interest.</p>
  <p>"There appeared to be no one in the cottage, upstairs or
          down. I called to Afy, but she did not answer. I
          caught up the gun, and was running from the cottage,
          when Locksley came out of the wood, and looked at
          me. I grew confused; fearful; and I threw the gun
          back again, and made off."</p>
  <p>"What were your motives for acting in that way?"</p>
  <p>"A panic had come over me; and in that moment I must have
          lost the use of my reason, otherwise I never should
          have acted as I did. Thoughts, especially of fear,
          pass through our minds with astonishing swiftness,
          and I feared lest the crime should be fastened upon
          me. It was fear made me snatch up my gun, lest it
          should be found near the body; it was fear made me
          throw it back again when Locksley appeared in view;
          a fear, <pb n="222"/> from which all judgment, all
          reason, had departed. But for my own conduct, the
          charge never would have been laid to me."</p>
  <p>"Go on."</p>
  <p>"In my flight, I came upon Bethel. I knew that if he had
          gone towards the cottage after the shot was fired,
          he must have encountered Thorn, flying from it. He
          denied that he had: he said he had only gone along
          the path for a few paces, and had then plunged into
          the wood again. I believed him; and departed."</p>
  <p>"Departed from West Lynne?"</p>
  <p>"That night I did. It was a foolish, fatal step, the
          result of cowardice. I found the charge was laid to
          me, and I thought I would absent myself for a day or
          two, to see how things turned out. Next, came the
          inquest and the verdict against me; and I left for
          good."</p>
  <p>"This is the truth, so far as you are cognisant of
          it?"</p>
  <p>"I swear that it is the truth and the whole truth, so far
          as I am cognisant of it," replied Richard Hare, with
          emotion. "I could not assert it more solemnly, were
          I before God."</p>
  <p>He was subjected to a rigid cross-examination, but his
          testimony was not shaken in the least. Perhaps not
          one present, but was impressed with its truth.</p>
  <p>Afy Hallijohn was recalled, and questioned as to
          Richard's presence at her father's house that night.
          It tallied with the account given by Richard; but it
          had to be drawn from her.</p>
  <p>"Why did you decline to receive Richard Hare into the
          cottage, after appointing him to come?"</p>
  <p>"Because I chose," returned Afy.</p>
  <p>"Tell the jury why you chose."</p>
  <pb n="223"/>
  <p>"Well—I had got a friend with me. It was Captain Thorn,"
          she added, feeling that she should only be
          questioned on the point, so might as well
          acknowledge it. "I did not admit Richard Hare, for I
          fancied they might get up a quarrel, if they were
          together."</p>
  <p>"For what purpose did Richard Hare bring down his gun? Do
          you know?"</p>
  <p>"It was to lend to my father. My father's gun had
          something the matter with it and was at the smith's.
          I had heard him, the previous day, ask Mr. Richard
          to lend him one of his, and Mr. Richard said he
          would bring one. As he did."</p>
  <p>"You lodged the gun against the wall. Safely?"</p>
  <p>"Quite safely."</p>
  <p>"Was it touched by you after placing it there? Or by the
          prisoner?"</p>
  <p>"I did not touch it. Neither did he, that I saw. It was
          the same gun which was afterwards found near my
          father, and had been discharged."</p>
  <p>The next witness called was Otway Bethel. He held share
          also in the curiosity of the public: but not in an
          equal degree with Afy: still less with Richard Hare.
          The substance of his testimony was as follows:</p>
  <p>"On the evening that Hallijohn was killed, I was in Abbey
          Wood, and I saw Richard Hare come down the path with
          a gun, as if he had come from his own home."</p>
  <p>"Did Richard Hare see you?"</p>
  <p>"No: he could not see me: I was right in the thicket. He
          went to the cottage door, and was about to enter,
          when Afy Hallijohn came hastily out of it, pulling
          the door-to, behind her, and holding it in her hand,
          as if afraid he would go in. Some colloquy <pb n="224"/> ensued, but I was too far off to hear
          it, and then she took the gun from him and went
          in-doors. Some time after that, I saw Richard Hare
          amid the trees at a distance, farther off the
          cottage then, than I was, and apparently watching
          the path. I was wondering what he was up to, hiding
          there, when I heard a shot fired; close as it
          seemed, to the cottage, and—"</p>
  <p>"Stop a bit, witness. Could that shot have been fired by
          Richard Hare?"</p>
  <p>"It could not. He was a quarter of a mile, nearly, away
          from it. I was much nearer the cottage than he."</p>
  <p>"Go on."</p>
  <p>"I could not imagine what that shot meant, or who could
          have fired it. Not that I suspected mischief: and I
          knew that poachers did not congregate so near
          Hallijohn's cottage. I set off to reconnoitre, and
          as I turned the corner, which brought the house
          within my view, I saw Captain Thorn—as he was
          called— come leaping out of it. His face was white
          with terror, his breath was gone—in short, I never
          saw any living man betray so much agitation. I
          caught his arm as he would have passed me. 'What
          have you been about?' I asked. 'Was it you, who
          fired?' He—"</p>
  <p>"Stay. Why did you suspect him?"</p>
  <p>"From his state of excitement; from the terror he was in.
          That some ill had happened, I felt sure—and so would
          you, had you seen him as I did. My arresting him
          increased his agitation: he tried to throw me off,
          but I am a strong man: and I suppose he thought it
          best to temporise. 'Keep dark upon it, Bethel,' he
          said, 'I will make it worth your while. The thing
          was not premeditated: it was done in the heat of
          passion. <pb n="225"/> What business had the fellow
          to abuse me? I have done no harm to the girl.' As he
          thus spoke, he took out a pocket-book with the hand
          that was at liberty; I held the other—"</p>
  <p>"As the prisoner thus spoke, you mean?"</p>
  <p>"The prisoner. He took a bank-note from his pocket-book,
          and thrust it into my hands. It was a note for 50
            <hi>l</hi> . 'What's done can't be undone,
          Bethel,' he said, 'and your saying that you saw me
          here can serve no good turn. Shall it be silence?' I
          took the note, and answered that it should be
          silence. I had not the least idea that anybody was
          killed."</p>
  <p>"What did you suppose had happened, then?"</p>
  <p>"I could not suppose; I could not think; it all passed in
          the haste and confusion of a moment, and no definite
          ideas occurred to me. Thorn flew on, down the path,
          and I stood looking after him. The next was, I heard
          footsteps, and I slipped within the trees. They were
          those of Richard Hare, who took the path to the
          cottage. Presently he returned, little less agitated
          than Thorn had been. I had gone into an open space
          then, and he accosted me, asking if I had seen 'that
          hound' fly from the cottage? 'What hound?' I asked
          him. 'That fine fellow, that Thorn, who comes after
          Afy,' he answered, but I stoutly denied that I had
          seen any one. Richard Hare continued his way, and I
          afterwards found that Hallijohn was killed."</p>
  <p>"And so, you took a bribe to conceal one of the foulest
          crimes that ever man committed, Mr. Otway
          Bethel!"</p>
  <p>"I took the money: and am ashamed to confess to it. But
          it was done without reflection. I swear that had I
          known what crime it was intended to hush up, I <pb n="226"/> never would have touched it. I was hard
          up for funds, and the amount tempted me. When I
          discoverved what had really happened and that
          Richard Hare was accused, I was thunderstruck at my
          own deed: many a hundred times, since, have I cursed
          the money; and the fate of Richard has been as a
          heavy weight upon my conscience."</p>
  <p>"You might have lifted the weight by confessing."</p>
  <p>"To what end? It was too late. Thorn had disappeared. I
          never heard of him, or saw him, until he came to
          West Lynne this last spring, as Sir Francis Levison,
          to oppose Mr. Carlyle. Richard Hare had also
          disappeared; had never been seen or heard of; and
          most people supposed he was dead. To what end, then,
          should I confess? Perhaps only to be suspected
          myself. Besides, I had taken the money upon a
          certain understanding, and it was only fair that I
          should keep to it."</p>
  <p>If Richard Hare was subjected to a severe
          cross-examination, a far more severe one awaited
          Otway Bethel. The judge spoke to him only once, his
          tone ringing with reproach.</p>
  <p>"It appears then, witness, that you have retained within
          you all these years, the proofs of Richard Hare's
          innocence?"</p>
  <p>"I can only acknowledge it with contrition, my lord."</p>
  <p>"What did you know of Thorn in those days?" asked the
          counsel.</p>
  <p>"Nothing; save that he frequented the Abbey Wood, his
          object being Afy Hallijohn. I had never exchanged a
          word with him until this night; but I knew his name,
          Thorn—at least, the one he went by. And by his <pb n="227"/> addressing me as Bethel, it appeared
          that he knew mine."</p>
  <p>The case for the prosecution closed. An able and
          ingenious speech was made for the defence, the
          learned counsel who offered it contending that there
          was still no proof of Sir Francis Levison having
          been the guilty man. Neither was there any proof
          that the catastrophe was not the result of pure
          accident. A loaded gun, standing against the wall in
          a small room, was not a safe weapon; and he called
          upon the jury not rashly to convict in the
          uncertainty, but to give the prisoner the benefit of
          the doubt. He should call no witnesses, he observed,
          not even as to character. Character! for Sir Francis
          Levison! The court burst into a grin: the only sober
          face in it being that of the judge.</p>
  <p>The judge summed up. Certainly not in the prisoner's
          favour; but—to use the expression of some amongst
          the audience—dead against him. Otway Bethel came in
          for a side shaft or two from his lordship; Richard
          Hare for sympathy. The jury retired about four
          o'clock, and the judge quitted the bench.</p>
  <p>A very short time were they absent. Scarcely a quarter of
          an hour. His lordship returned into court, and the
          prisoner was again placed in the dock. He was the
          hue of marble, and, in his nervous agitation, kept
          incessantly throwing back his hair from his forehead
          —the action so often spoken of. Silence was
          proclaimed.</p>
  <p>"How say you, gentlemen of the jury? Guilty or not
          guilty?"</p>
  <p>" <hi>Guilty</hi> ." It was a silence to be felt: and the
          prisoner gasped once or twice convulsively. "But,"
            <pb n="228"/> added the foreman, "we wish to
          recommend him to mercy."</p>
  <p>"On what grounds?" inquired the judge.</p>
  <p>"Because, my lord, we believe that it was not a crime
          planned by the prisoner beforehand; but arose out of
          the bad passions of the moment, and was so
          committed."</p>
  <p>The judge paused: and drew something black from the
          receptacle of his pocket, buried deep in his
          robes.</p>
  <p>"Prisoner at the bar! Have you anything to urge why the
          sentence of death should not be passed upon
          you?"</p>
  <p>The prisoner clutched the front of the dock. He threw up
          his head, as if shaking off the dread fear which had
          oppressed him, and the marble of his face changed to
          scarlet.</p>
  <p>"Only this, my lord. The jury, in giving their reason for
          recommending me to your lordship's mercy, have
          adopted the right view of the case, as it actually
          occurred. That the man, Hallijohn's, life was taken
          by me, it will be useless for me to deny, in the
          face of the evidence given this day. But it was not
          taken in malice. When I quitted the girl, Afy, and
          went to the cottage for my hat, I no more
          contemplated injuring mortal man, than I contemplate
          it at this moment. He was there; the father; and in
          the dispute that ensued, the catastrophe occurred.
          My lord, it was not wilful murder."</p>
  <p>The prisoner ceased. And the judge, the black cap upon
          his head, crossed his hands one upon the other.</p>
  <p>"Prisoner at the bar. You have been convicted, by clear
          and undoubted evidence, of the crime of wilful
          murder. The jury have pronounced you guilty; and in
            <pb n="229"/> their verdict I entirely coincide.
          That you took the life of that ill-fated and
          unoffending man, there is no doubt; you have,
          yourself, confessed it. It was a foul, a barbarous,
          a wicked act. I care not for what may have been the
          particular circumstances attending it: he may have
          provoked you by words, but no provocation of that
          nature could justify your drawing the gun upon him.
          Your counsel urged that you were a gentleman, a
          member of the British aristocracy, and therefore
          deserved consideration. I confess that I was very
          much surprised to hear such a doctrine fall from his
          lips. In my opinion, your position in life makes
          your crime the worse: and I have always maintained
          that when a man possessed of advantages falls into
          sin, he deserves less consideration than does one
          who is poor, simple, and uneducated. Certain
          portions of the evidence given to-day (and I do not
          now allude to the actual crime) tell very greatly
          against you. You were pursuing the daughter of this
          man with no honourable purpose—and in this point
          your conduct contrasts badly with that of Richard
          Hare—equally a gentleman with yourself. In this
          pursuit you killed her father; and, not content with
          that, you still pursued the girl—and pursued her to
          her ruin. Basely deceiving her as to the actual
          facts, and laying the crime upon another. I cannot
          trust myself to speak further upon this point; nor
          is it necessary that I should: it is not to answer
          for that, that you stand before me. Uncalled,
          unprepared, and by you unpitied, you hurried that
          unfortunate man into eternity; and you must now
          expiate the crime with your own life. The jury have
          recommended you to mercy: and the recommendation
          will be forwarded in due course to the proper
          quarter: but you must be <pb n="230"/> aware how
          frequently this clause is appended to a verdict, and
          how very rarely it is attended to, just cause being
          wanting. I can but enjoin you, and I do so most
          earnestly, to pass the little time that probably
          remains to you on earth, in seeking repentance and
          forgiveness. You are best aware, yourself, what your
          past life has been: the world knows somewhat of it:
          but there is pardon Above for the most guilty, when
          it is earnestly sought. It now only remains for me
          to pass upon you the dread sentence of the law. It
          is, that you, Francis Levison, be taken back to the
          place whence you came, and thence to the place of
          execution, and that you be there hanged by the neck
          until you are dead. And may the Lord God Almighty
          have mercy upon your immortal soul!"</p>
  <p>"Amen!"</p>
  <p>The court was cleared. The day's excitement was over, and
          the next case was inquired for. Not quite over yet,
          however, the excitement, and the audience crowded in
          again. For the next case proved to be the
          arraignment of Richard Hare the younger. A formal
          proceeding merely, in pursuance of the verdict of
          the coroner's inquest. No evidence was offered
          against him, and the judge ordered him to be
          discharged. Richard, poor, ill-used, baited Richard,
          was a free man again.</p>
  <p>Then ensued the scene of all scenes. Half, at least, of
          those present, were residents of, or from near West
          Lynne. They had known Richard Hare from infancy;
          they had admired the boy in his pretty childhood;
          they had liked him in his unoffending boyhood; but
          they had been none the less ready to cast their
          harsh stones at him, and to thunder down their
          denunciations <pb n="231"/> when the time came. In
          proportion to their fierceness then, was their
          contrition now: Richard had been innocent all the
          while; they had been more guilty than he.</p>
  <p>An English mob, gentle or simple, never gets up its
          excitement by halves. Whether its demonstration be
          of a laudatory or a condemnatory nature, the steam
          is sure to be put on to bursting point. With one
          universal shout, with one bound, they rallied round
          Richard: they congratulated him, they overwhelmed
          him with good wishes, they expressed with shame
          their repentance, they said that the future should
          atone for the past. Had he possessed a hundred
          hands, they would have been shaken off. And when
          Richard extricated himself, and turned, in his
          pleasant, forgiving, loving nature, to his father,
          the stern old justice, forgetting his pride and his
          pomposity, burst into tears and sobbed like a child,
          as he murmured something about he, also, needing
          forgiveness.</p>
  <p>"Dear father," cried Richard, his own eyes wet, "it is
          forgiven and forgotten already. Think how happy we
          shall be again together! you, and I, and my
          mother."</p>
  <p>The justice's hands, which had been wound round his son,
          relaxed their hold. They were twitching curiously;
          the face was twitching curiously; the body also
          began to twitch: and he fell upon the shoulder of
          Colonel Bethel, in a second stroke of paralysis.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XX. THE DEATH CHAMBER.</head>
  <p><hi>By</hi> the side of William Carlyle's dying bed,
          knelt the Lady Isabel. The time was at hand, and the
          boy was quite reconciled to his fate. Merciful
          indeed is God to dying children! It is astonishing
          how very readily, where the right means are taken,
          they may be brought to look with pleasure, rather
          than fear, upon their unknown journey.</p>
  <p>The brilliant hectic, type of the disease, had gone from
          his cheeks, his features were white and wasted, and
          his eyes large and bright. His silky brown hair was
          pushed off his temples, and his little hot hands
          were thrown outside the bed.</p>
  <p>"It won't be so very long to wait, you know, will it,
          Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>"For what, darling?"</p>
  <p>"Before they all come. Papa and mamma, and Lucy, and all
          of them."</p>
  <p>A jealous feeling shot across her wearied heart. Was
            <hi>she</hi> nothing to him? "Do you not care that
          I should come to you, William?"</p>
  <p>"Yes, I hope you will. But, do you think we shall know
            <hi>everybody</hi> in heaven? Or will it be only
          our own relations?"</p>
  <pb n="233"/>
  <p>"Oh, child! I think there will be no relations, as you
          call them, up there. We can trust all that to God—
          however it may be."</p>
  <p>William lay looking upwards at the sky, apparently in
          thought. A dark blue, serene sky, from which shone
          the hot July sun. His bed had been moved near the
          window, for he liked to sit up in it and look at the
          landscape. The window was open now, and the
          butterflies and bees sported in the summer air.</p>
  <p>"I wonder how it will be?" pondered he, aloud. "There
          will be the beautiful city, with its gates of pearl,
          and its shining precious stones, and its streets of
          gold: and there will be the clear river, and the
          trees with their fruits and their healing leaves,
          and the lovely flowers: and there will be the harps,
          and music, and singing: and what else will there
          be?"</p>
  <p>"Everything that is desirable and beautiful,
          William."</p>
  <p>Another pause. "Madame Vine, will Jesus come for me, do
          you think, or will he send an angel?"</p>
  <p>"Jesus has <hi>promised</hi> to come for his own
          redeemed; for those who love him and wait for
          him."</p>
  <p>"Yes, yes. And then I shall be happy for ever. It will be
          so pleasant to be there! never to be tired or ill
          again."</p>
  <p>"Pleasant? Ay! Oh, William! would that the time were
          come!" She was thinking of herself; her freedom;
          though the boy knew it not. She buried her face in
          her hands and continued speaking: William had to
          bend his ear to catch the faint whisper.</p>
  <p>"'And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
          crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for
          the former things are passed away.'"</p>
  <pb n="234"/>
  <p>"Madame Vine, do you think mamma will be there?" he
          presently asked. "I mean mamma that was."</p>
  <p>"Ay. Ere long."</p>
  <p>"But how shall I know her? You see, I have nearly
          forgotten what she was like."</p>
  <p>She leaned over him, laying her forehead upon his wasted
          arm; she burst into a flood of impassioned tears.
          "You will know her; never fear, William: she has not
          forgotten you."</p>
  <p>"But how can we be sure that she will be there?" debated
          William, after a pause of thought. "You
          know"—sinking his voice, and speaking with
          hesitation —"she was not quite good. She was not
          good to papa or to us. Sometimes I think, suppose
          she did not grow good, and did not ask God to
          forgive her?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, William," sobbed the unhappy lady, "her whole life,
          after she left you, was one long scene of
          repentance, of seeking forgiveness. Her repentance,
          her sorrow, was greater than she could bear,
          and—"</p>
  <p>"And what?" asked William, for there was a pause.</p>
  <p>"Her heart broke in it; yearning after you and your
          father."</p>
  <p>"What makes you think it?"</p>
  <p>"Child, I <hi>know</hi> it."</p>
  <p>William considered. Then—had he been strong enough—would
          have started up with energy. "Madame Vine, you could
          only know that, by mamma's telling you! Did you ever
          see her? Did you know her abroad?"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel's thoughts were far away; up in the clouds,
          perhaps. She reflected not on the possible
          consequences of her answer: or she had never given
          it.</p>
  <pb n="235"/>
  <p>"Yes: I knew her abroad."</p>
  <p>"Oh!" said the boy. "Why did you never tell us? What did
          she say? What was she like?"</p>
  <p>"She said"—sobbing wildly—"that she was parted from her
          children here. But she should meet them in heaven
          and be with them for ever. William, darling! all the
          awful pain, and sadness, and guilt of this world,
          will be washed out, and God will wipe our tears
          away."</p>
  <p>"What was her face like?" he questioned, softly.</p>
  <p>"Like yours. Very much like Lucy's."</p>
  <p>"Was she pretty?"</p>
  <p>A momentary pause. "Yes."</p>
  <p>"Oh dear! I am ill! Hold me!" cried out William, as his
          head sank to one side, and great drops, as large as
          peas, broke forth upon his clammy face. It appeared
          to be one of the temporary faint attacks that had
          overpowered him at times lately, and Lady Isabel
          rang the bell hastily.</p>
  <p>Wilson came in, in answer. Joyce was the usual attendant
          upon the sick room, but Mrs. Carlyle, with her
          infant, was passing the day at the Grove,
          unconscious of the critical state of William, and
          she had taken Joyce with her. It was the day
          following the trial. Mr. Justice Hare had been
          brought to West Lynne in his second attack, and
          Barbara had gone to see him, to console her mother,
          and to welcome Richard to his home again. If one
          carriage drove, that day, to the Grove, with cards
          and inquiries, fifty did; not to speak of the foot
          callers. "It is all meant by way of attention to
          you, Richard," said gentle Mrs. Hare, smiling
          through her loving tears at her restored son. Lucy
          and Archie were dining at Miss Carlyle's, and <pb n="236"/> Sarah attended little Arthur: leaving
          Wilson free. She came in, in answer to Madame Vine's
          ring.</p>
  <p>"Is he off in another faint?" unceremoniously cried she,
          hastening to the bed.</p>
  <p>"I think so. Help me to raise him."</p>
  <p>William did not faint. No: the attack was quite different
          from those he was subject to. Instead of losing
          consciousness and power, as was customary, he shook
          as if he had the ague, and laid hold both of Madame
          Vine and Wilson, grasping them convulsively.</p>
  <p>"Don't let me fall! don't let me fall!" he gasped.</p>
  <p>"My dear, you cannot fall," responded Madame Vine. "You
          forget that you'are on the bed."</p>
  <p>He clasped them yet, and trembled still, as from fear.
          "Don't let me fall! don't let me fall!" the
          incessant burden of his cry.</p>
  <p>The paroxysm passed. They wiped his brow, and stood
          looking at him: Wilson with a pursed-up mouth, and a
          peculiar expression of face. She put a spoonful of
          restorative jelly between his lips, and he swallowed
          it, but shook his head when she would have given him
          another. Turning his face to the pillow, in a few
          minutes he was in a doze.</p>
  <p>"What could it have been?" exclaimed Lady Isabel, in an
          under tone to Wilson.</p>
  <p>" <hi>I</hi> know," was the oracular answer. "I saw this
          same sort of attack once before, madame."</p>
  <p>"And what caused it?"</p>
  <p>"'Twasn't in a child, though," went on Wilson. "'Twas in
          a grown-up person. But that's nothing: it comes for
          the same thing in all. I think he was taken for
          death."</p>
  <p>"Who?" uttered Lady Isabel, startled.</p>
  <pb n="237"/>
  <p>Wilson made no reply in words, but she pointed with her
          finger to the bed.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Wilson! He is not so ill as that. Mr. Wainwright
          said this morning that he might last a week or
          two."</p>
  <p>Wilson composedly sat down in the easiest chair. She was
          not wont to put herself out of the way for the
          governess: and that governess was too much afraid of
          her, in one sense, to let her know her place. "As to
          Wainwright, he's nobody," quoth she. "And if he saw
          the child's breath going out before his face, and
          knew that the next moment would be his last, he'd
          vow to us all that he was good for twelve hours to
          come. You don't know Wainwright as I do, madame. He
          was our doctor at mother's; and he has attended in
          all the places I have lived in, since I went out to
          service. Five years I was head nurse at Squire
          Pinner's; going on for four, I was lady's-maid at
          Mrs. Hare's; I came here when Miss Lucy was a baby;
          and in all my places has he attended, like one's
          shadow. My Lady Isabel thought great guns of old
          Wainwright, I remember. It was more than I did."</p>
  <p>My Lady Isabel made no response to this. She took a seat,
          and watched William. His breathing was more laboured
          than usual.</p>
  <p>"That idiot Sarah says to me to-day, says she, 'Which of
          his two grandpapas will they bury him by— old Mr.
          Carlyle, or Lord Mount Severn?' 'Don't be a calf?' I
          answered her. 'D'ye think they'll stick him out in
          the corner with my lord?—he'll be put in the Carlyle
          vault, of course.' It would have been different you
          see, Madame Vine, if my lady had died at home, all
          proper, Mr. Carlyle's wife. They'd have buried her
          no <pb n="238"/> doubt by her father, and the boy
          would have been laid with her. But she did not."</p>
  <p>No reply was made by Madame Vine; and a silence ensued.
          Nothing to be heard but that fleeting breath.</p>
  <p>"I wonder how that beauty feels?" suddenly broke forth
          Wilson again, her tone one of scornful irony.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel, her eyes and her thoughts absorbed by
          William, positively thought Wilson's words must
          relate to him. She turned to her in surprise.</p>
  <p>"That bright gem in the prison at Lynneborough,"
          explained Wilson. "I hope he may have found himself
          pretty well since yesterday! I wonder how many
          trainfuls from West Lynne will go to his
          hanging?"</p>
  <p>Her face turned crimson; her heart sick. She had not
          dared to inquire how the trial terminated. The
          subject altogether was too dreadful, and nobody had
          happened to mention it in her hearing.</p>
  <p>"Is he condemned?" she asked, in a low tone.</p>
  <p>"He is condemned; and good luck to him! and Mr. Otway
          Bethel's let loose again; and good luck to
            <hi>him</hi> . A nice pair they are! Nobody went
          from this house to hear the trial—it might not have
          been pleasant, you know, madame, to Mr. Carlyle—but
          people came in last night and told us all about it.
          Young Richard Hare chiefly convicted him. He is back
          again, and so nice-looking, they say, ten times more
          so than he was when quite a young man. You should
          have heard, they say, the cheerings and shouts which
          greeted Mr. Richard when his innocence came out: it
          pretty near rose off the roof of the court; and the
          judge didn't stop it."</p>
  <p>Wilson paused, but there was no answering comment. On she
          went again.</p>
  <pb n="239"/>
  <p>"When Mr. Carlyle brought the news home last evening, and
          broke it to his wife—telling her how Mr. Richard had
          been received with acclamations, she nearly fainted;
          for she's not strong yet. Mr. Carlyle called out to
          me to bring some water: I was in the next room with
          the baby: and there she was, the tears raining from
          her eyes, and he holding her to him. I always said
          there was a whole world of love between those two,
          though he did go and marry another. Mr. Carlyle
          ordered me to put the water down, and sent me away
          again. But I don't fancy he told her of old Hare's
          attack until this morning."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel lifted her aching forehead. "What
          attack?"</p>
  <p>"Why, madame, don't you know? I declare you box yourself
          up in the house, keeping from everybody, till you
          hear nothing. You might as well be living at the
          bottom of a coal-pit. Old Hare had another stroke in
          the court at Lynneborough: and that's why my
          mistress is gone to the Grove to-day."</p>
  <p>"Who says Richard Hare's come home, Wilson?"</p>
  <p>The question, the weak, scarcely audible question, had
          come from the dying boy. Wilson threw up her hands,
          and made a bound to the bed. "The like of that!" she
          uttered, aside to Madame Vine. "One never knows when
          to take these sick ones. Master William, you hold
          your tongue, and drop off to sleep again. Your papa
          will be home soon from Lynneborough, and if you talk
          and get tired, he'll say it's my fault. Come, shut
          your eyes. Will you have a bit more jelly?"</p>
  <p>William, making no reply to the offer of jelly, buried
          his face again on the pillow. But he was grievously
            <pb n="240"/> restless. The nearly worn-out spirit
          was ebbing and flowing.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was at Lynneborough. He always had much
          business there at assize time, in the Nisi Prius
          court. But, the previous day, he had not gone
          himself; Mr. Dill had been despatched to represent
          him.</p>
  <p>Between seven and eight he returned home, and came into
          William's chamber. The boy brightened up at the
          well-known presence.</p>
  <p>"Papa!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle sat down on the bed and kissed him. The
          passing beams of the sun, slanting from the horizon,
          shone into the room, and Mr. Carlyle could view well
          the dying face. The grey hue of death was certainly
          on it.</p>
  <p>"Is he worse?" he exclaimed hastily to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"He appears worse this evening, sir. More weak."</p>
  <p>"Papa," panted William, "is the trial over?"</p>
  <p>"What trial, my boy?"</p>
  <p>"Sir Francis Levison's."</p>
  <p>"It was over yesterday. Never trouble your head about
          him, my brave boy. He is not worth it."</p>
  <p>"But, I want to know. Will they hang him?"</p>
  <p>"He is sentenced to it."</p>
  <p>"Did he kill Hallijohn?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. Who has been talking to him upon the subject?" Mr.
          Carlyle continued to Madame Vine, marked displeasure
          in his tone.</p>
  <p>"Wilson mentioned it, sir," was the low answer.</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa, what will he do? Will Jesus forgive
            <hi>him?</hi> "</p>
  <p>"We must hope it."</p>
  <pb n="241"/>
  <p>"Do you hope it, papa?"</p>
  <p>"Yes. I wish that all the world may be forgiven, William:
          whatever may have been their sins. My child, how
          restless you seem!"</p>
  <p>"I can't keep in one place. The bed gets wrong. Pull me
          up on the pillow, will you, Madame Vine?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle gently lifted the boy himself. "Madame Vine
          is an untiring nurse to you, William," he observed,
          gratefully casting a glance towards her in the
          distance, where she had retreated, and was shaded by
          the window curtain.</p>
  <p>William made no reply. He seemed to be trying to recall
          something. "I forget; I forget!"</p>
  <p>"Forget what?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"It was something I wanted to ask you; or to tell you.
          Isn't Lucy come home?"</p>
  <p>"I suppose not."</p>
  <p>"Papa, I want Joyce."</p>
  <p>"I will send her home to you. I am going for your mamma
          after dinner."</p>
  <p>"For mamma?—oh, I remember now. Papa, how shall I know
          mamma in heaven? Not this mamma."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle did not immediately reply. The question may
          have puzzled him. William continued hastily:
          possibly mistaking the motive of the silence.</p>
  <p>"She <hi>will</hi> be in heaven, you know."</p>
  <p>"Yes, yes, child"—speaking hurriedly.</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine knows she will. She saw her abroad: and
          mamma told her that—what was it, madame?"</p>
  <p>Madame Vine grew sick with alarm. Mr. Carlyle turned his
          eyes upon her scarlet face—as much as he <pb n="242"/> could get to see of it. She would have escaped
          from the room if she could.</p>
  <p>"Mamma was more sorry than she could bear," went on
          William, finding he was not helped. "She wanted you,
          papa, and she wanted us, and her heart broke, and
          she died."</p>
  <p>A flush rose to Mr. Carlyle's brow. He turned inquiringly
          to Madame Vine.</p>
  <p>"Oh, I <hi>beg</hi> your pardon, sir," she murmured, with
          desperate energy. "I ought not so to have spoken: I
          ought not to have interfered in your family affairs.
          I spoke only as I thought it must be, sir. The boy
          seemed troubled about his mother."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle was at sea. "Did you meet his mother abroad?
          I scarcely understand."</p>
  <p>She lifted her hand and covered her glowing face. "No,
          sir." Surely the recording angel blotted out the
          words! If ever a prayer for forgiveness went up from
          an aching heart, it must have gone up then, for the
          equivocation uttered over her child's death-bed!</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle went towards her. "Do you perceive the change
          in his countenance?" he whispered.</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir; yes. He has looked like this since a strange
          fit of trembling that came on in the afternoon.
          Wilson thought he might be taken for death. I fear
          some four-and-twenty hours will end it."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle rested his elbow on the window-frame, and his
          hand upon his brow, his drooping eyelids falling
          over his eyes. "It is hard to lose him."</p>
  <p>"Oh, sir, he will be better off!" she wailed, choking
          down the sobs and the emotion, that arose
          threateningly. "We <hi>can</hi> bear death: it is
          not the worst parting that the earth knows. He will
          be quit of this <pb n="243"/> cruel world; sheltered
          in heaven. I wish we were all there!"</p>
  <p>A servant came to say that Mr. Carlyle's dinner was
          served, and he proceeded to it with what appetite he
          had. When he returned to the sick-room, the daylight
          had faded, and a solitary candle was placed where
          its rays could not fall upon the child's face. Mr.
          Carlyle took the light in his hand to scan that face
          again. He was lying sideways on the pillow, his
          hollow breath echoing through the room. The light
          caused him to open his eyes.</p>
  <p>"Don't papa, please. I like it dark."</p>
  <p>"Only for one moment, my precious boy." And, not for more
          than a moment did Mr. Carlyle hold it. The blue,
          pinched, ghastly look was there yet. Death was
          certainly coming on quick.</p>
  <p>At that moment Lucy and Archibald came in, on their
          return from their visit to Miss Carlyle. The dying
          boy looked up eagerly.</p>
  <p>"Good bye, Lucy," he said, putting out his cold damp
          hand.</p>
  <p>"I am not going out," replied Lucy. "We have but just
          come home."</p>
  <p>"Good bye, Lucy," repeated he.</p>
  <p>She laid hold of the little hand then, leaned over, and
          kissed him. "Good bye, William: but indeed I am not
          going out anywhere."</p>
  <p>"I am," said he. "I am going to heaven. Where's
          Archie?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle lifted Archie on to the bed. Lucy looked
          frightened. Archie, surprised.</p>
  <p>"Archie, good bye; good bye, dear. I am going to heaven:
          to that bright blue sky, you know. I shall <pb n="244"/> see mamma there, and I'll tell her that
          you and Lucy are coming soon."</p>
  <p>Lucy, a sensitive child, broke into a loud storm of sobs:
          enough to disturb the equanimity of any sober
          sick-room. Wilson hastened in at the sound, and Mr.
          Carlyle sent the two children away, with soothing
          promises that they should see William in the
          morning, if he continued well enough.</p>
  <p>Down on her knees, her face buried in the counterpane, a
          corner of it stuffed into her mouth that it might
          help to stifle her agony, knelt Lady Isabel. The
          moment's excitement was well nigh beyond her
          strength of endurance. Her own child; his child;
          they alone around its death-bed, and she might not
          ask or receive from him a word of comfort, of
          consolation!</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle glanced at her as he caught her choking sobs;
          just as he would have glanced at any other attentive
          governess. Feeling her sympathy, doubtless; but
          nothing more: she was not heart and part with him
          and his departing boy. Lower and lower bent he over
          that boy, for his eyes were wet.</p>
  <p>"Don't cry, papa," whispered William, raising his feeble
          hand caressingly to his father's cheek. "I am not
          afraid to go. Jesus is coming for me."</p>
  <p>"Afraid to go! Indeed I hope not, my gentle boy. You are
          going to God; to happiness. A few years; we know not
          how few; and we shall all come to you."</p>
  <p>"Yes, you will be sure to come: I know that. I shall tell
          mamma so. I dare say she is looking out for me now.
          Perhaps she's standing on the banks of the river,
          watching the boats."</p>
  <p>He had evidently got that picture of Martin's in his
          mind, the Plains of Heaven. Mr. Carlyle turned to
          the <pb n="245"/> table. He saw some strawberry
          juice, pressed from the fresh fruit, and moistened
          with it the boy's fevered lips.</p>
  <p>"Papa, I can't think how Jesus can be in all the boats!
          Perhaps they don't go quite at the same time? He
          must be, you know, because he comes to fetch
          us."</p>
  <p>"He will be in yours, darling," was the whispered,
          fervent answer.</p>
  <p>"Oh yes. He will take me all the way up to God, and say,
          'Here's a poor little boy come, and you must please
          to forgive him and let him go into Heaven, because I
          died for him!' Papa, did you know that mamma's heart
          broke?"</p>
  <p>A caress was all the reply Mr. Carlyle returned.
          William's restlessness of body appeared to be
          extending to his mind. He would not be put off.</p>
  <p>"Papa! did you know that mamma's heart broke?"</p>
  <p>"William, I think it likely that your poor mamma's heart
          did break, ere death came. But let us talk of you;
          not of her. Are you in pain?"</p>
  <p>"I can't breathe; I can't swallow. I wish Joyce was
          here."</p>
  <p>"She will not be long."</p>
  <p>The boy nestled himself in his father's arms, and in a
          few minutes appeared to be asleep. Mr. Carlyle,
          after a while, gently laid him on his pillow,
          watched him, and then turned to depart.</p>
  <p>"Oh, papa, papa!" he cried out, in a tone of painful
          entreaty, opening wide his yearning eyes, "say good
          bye to me!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle's tears fell upon the little up-turned face,
          as he once more caught it to his breast.</p>
  <p>"My darling, papa will soon be back. He was not <pb n="246"/> going to leave you for more than an
          hour. He is going to bring mamma to see you."</p>
  <p>"And pretty little baby Anna?"</p>
  <p>"And baby Anna, if you would like her to come in. I will
          not leave my darling boy for long: he need not fear.
          I shall not leave you again to-night, William, when
          once I am back."</p>
  <p>"Then put me down, and go, papa."</p>
  <p>A lingering embrace; a fond, lingering, tearful embrace,
          Mr. Carlyle holding him to his beating heart. Then
          he laid him comfortably on his pillow, gave him a
          teaspoonful of strawberry juice, and hastened
          away.</p>
  <p>"Good bye, papa," came forth the little feeble cry.</p>
  <p>It was not heard. Mr. Carlyle was gone. Gone from his
          living child—for ever. Up rose Lady Isabel, and
          flung her arms aloft in a storm of sobs.</p>
  <p>"Oh, William, darling! in this dying moment let me be to
          you as your mother!"</p>
  <p>Again he unclosed his wearied eyelids. It is probable
          that he only partially understood.</p>
  <p>"Papa's gone for her."</p>
  <p>"Not <hi>her!</hi> I—I—" Lady Isabel checked herself, and
          fell sobbing on the bed. No; not even at that last
          hour when the world was closing on him, dared she
          say, I am your mother.</p>
  <p>Wilson re-entered. "He looks as if he were dropping off
          to sleep," quoth she.</p>
  <p>"Yes," said Lady Isabel. "You need not wait, Wilson. I
          will ring if he requires anything."</p>
  <p>Wilson, though withal not a bad-hearted woman, was not
          one to remain for pleasure, in a sick room, if told
          she might leave it. Lady Isabel, remained alone. She
          fell on her knees again, this time in prayer. <pb n="247"/> In prayer for the departing spirit, on
          its wing, and that God would mercifully vouchsafe
          herself a resting-place with it in heaven.</p>
  <p>A review of the past then rose up before her. From the
          time of her first entering that house, the bride of
          Mr. Carlyle, to her present sojourn in it. The old
          scenes passed through her mind, like the changing
          pictures in a phantasmagoria. Why should they have
          come, there and then? She knew not.</p>
  <p>William slept on silently: <hi>she</hi> thought of the
          past. The dreadful reflection, "If I had not—done as
          I did— how different would it have been now!" had
          been sounding its knell in her heart so often, that
          she had almost ceased to shudder at it. The very
          nails of her hands had, before now, entered the
          palms with the sharp pain it brought. Stealing over
          her more especially this night as she knelt there,
          her head lying on the counterpane, came the
          recollection of that first illness of hers. How she
          had lain, and, in her unfounded jealousy, imagined
          Barbara the house's mistress. She, dead; Barbara
          exalted to her place, Mr. Carlyle's wife, her
          child's stepmother! She recalled the day when, her
          mind excited by certain gossip of Wilson's—it was
          previously in a state of fever bordering on
          delirium—she had prayed her husband, in terror and
          anguish, not to marry Barbara. "How could he marry
          her?" he had replied, in his soothing pity. "She,
          Isabel, was his wife: who was Barbara? Nothing to
          them." But it had all come to pass. <hi>She</hi> had
          brought it forth. Not Mr. Carlyle; not Barbara; she
          alone. Oh the dreadful misery of the retrospect!</p>
  <p>Lost in thought, in anguish past and present, in
          self-condemning repentance, the time passed on.
          Nearly an hour must have elapsed since Mr. Carlyle's
          departure, <pb n="248"/> and William had not
          disturbed her. But—who was this, coming into the
          room? Joyce.</p>
  <p>She hastily rose up, as Joyce, advancing with a quiet
          step, drew aside the clothes to look at William.
          "Master says he has been wanting me," she observed.
          "Why—oh!"</p>
  <p>It was a sharp, momentary cry, subdued as soon as
          uttered. Madame Vine sprang forward to Joyce's side
          looking also. The pale young face lay calm in its
          utter stillness; the busy little heart had ceased to
          beat. Jesus Christ had indeed come, and taken the
          fleeting spirit.</p>
  <p>Then she lost all self-control. She believed that she had
          reconciled herself to the child's death, that she
          could part with him without too great emotion. But
          she had not anticipated it would be quite so soon;
          she had deemed that some hours more would at least
          be given him; and now the storm overwhelmed her.
          Crying, sobbing, calling, she flung herself upon
          him; she clasped him to her; she dashed off her
          disguising glasses; she laid her face upon his.
          Beseeching him to come back to her that she might
          say farewell; to her, his mother; her darling child,
          her lost William.</p>
  <p>Joyce was terrified; terrified for consequences. With her
          full strength she pulled her from the boy. praying
          her to consider; to be still. "Do not, do not, for
          the love of Heaven! <hi>My lady! my lady!</hi> "</p>
  <p>It was the old familiar title that struck upon her fears
          and induced calmness. She stared at Joyce, and
          retreated backwards; after the manner of one
          receding from some hideous vision.</p>
  <p>"My lady, let me take you into your room. Mr. Carlyle is
          come; he is but bringing up his wife. Only <pb n="249"/> think if you should give way before him!
          Pray come away!"</p>
  <p>"How did you know me?" she asked, in a hollow voice.</p>
  <p>"My lady, it was that night when there was an alarm of
          fire. I went close up to you to take Master
          Archibald from your arms: and, as sure as I am now
          standing here, I believe that for the moment my
          senses left me. I thought I saw a spectre; the
          spectre of my dead lady. I forgot the present; I
          forgot that all were standing round me; that you,
          Madame Vine, were alive before me. Your face was not
          disguised then: the moonlight shone full upon it,
          and I knew it, after the first few moments of
          terror, to be, in dreadful truth, the
            <hi>living</hi> one of Lady Isabel. My lady, come
          away! we shall have Mr. Carlyle here."</p>
  <p>Poor thing! She sank upon her knees, in her humility, her
          dread. "Oh, Joyce, have pity upon me! don't betray
          me! I will leave the house; indeed I will. Don't
          betray me while I am in it!"</p>
  <p>"My lady, you have nothing to fear from me. I have kept
          the secret buried within my breast since then. Last
          April! It has nearly been too much for me. By night
          and by day I have had no peace, dreading what might
          come out. Think of the awful confusion, the
          consequences, should it come to the knowledge of Mr.
          and Mrs. Carlyle. Indeed, my lady, you never ought
          to have come."</p>
  <p>"Joyce," she said hollowly, lifting her haggard face, "I
          could not keep away from my unhappy children. Is it
          no punishment to <hi>me</hi> , think you, the being
          here?" she added, vehemently. "To see him—my
          husband— the husband of another! It is killing
          me."</p>
  <pb n="250"/>
  <p>"Oh, my lady, come away! I hear him; I hear him!"</p>
  <p>Partly coaxing, partly dragging her, Joyce took her into
          her own room, and left her there. Mr. Carlyle was at
          that moment at the door of the sick one. Joyce
          sprang forward. Her face, in her emotion and fear,
          was of one livid whiteness, and she shook as William
          had shaken, poor child, in the afternoon. It was
          only too apparent in the well-lighted corridor.</p>
  <p>"Joyce!" he exclaimed in amazement, "what ails you?"</p>
  <p>"Sir! master!" she panted, "be prepared. Master
          William—Master William—"</p>
  <p>"Joyce! Not <hi>dead?</hi> "</p>
  <p>"Alas, yes, sir!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle strode into the chamber. But, ere he was well
          across it, turned back to slip the bolt of the door.
          On the pillow lay the white, thin face, at rest
          now.</p>
  <p>"My boy! my boy! Oh, God!" he murmured, in bowed
          reverence, "mayst Thou have received this child to
          his rest in Jesus! Even as, I trust, Thou hadst
          already received his unhappy mother!"</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XXI. LORD VANE DATING FORWARDS.</head>
  <p><hi>To</hi> the funeral of William Carlyle came Lord
          Mount Severn and his son. Wilson had been right in
          her surmises as to the resting place. The Carlyle
          vault was opened for him, and an order went forth to
          the sculptor, for an inscription to be added to
          their marble tablet in the church. "William Vane
          Carlyle, eldest son of Archibald Carlyle, of East
          Lynne." Amongst those who attended the funeral as
          mourners, went one more notable in the eyes of
          gazers than the rest; Richard Hare the younger.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel was ill. Ill in mind, and ominously ill in
          body. She kept her room; and Joyce attended on her.
          The household set down madame's illness to the
          fatigue of having attended upon Master William: it
          was not thought of seriously by any one, especially
          as she declined to see a doctor. All her thoughts,
          now, were directed to the getting away from East
          Lynne, for it would never do to remain there to die;
          and she knew that death was on his way to her, and
          that no human power or skill, not all the faculty
          combined, could turn him back again. The excessive
          dread of detection was not upon her as it had been
          formerly: I mean, she did not dread the consequences
          so much, if detection came. <pb n="252"/> In nearing
          the grave, all fears and hopes, of whatever nature,
          relating to this world, lose their force; and fears,
          or hopes, regarding the next world, take their
          place.</p>
  <p>In returning to East Lynne, Lady Isabel had entered upon
          a daring act: and she found, in the working, that
          neither strength nor spirit was equal to it.
          Presuming upon the extraordinary change which had
          taken place in her appearance, and which, with her
          own care, rendered detection next door to an
          impossibility, she had suffered it to blind her
          judgment, and lead her upon a course that could only
          end badly. Let people talk as they will, it is
          impossible to drive out human passions from the
          human heart. You may suppress them, deaden them,
          keep them in subjection, but you cannot root them
          out. The very best man that attains to the greatest
          holiness on earth has need constantly to strive and
          pray, if he would keep away evil from his thoughts,
          passions from his nature. His life must be spent in
          self-watchfulness; he must "pray always," at
          morning, at evening, at midday: and he cannot do it
          then. One of the greatest of our living divines,
          grey now with years and infirmities, said in a
          memorable sermon, preached in Worcester cathedral in
          the zenith of his fame and power, that the life,
          even of a good man, was made up of daily sinning and
          repenting. So it is. Human passions and tempers were
          brought with us into this world, and they can only
          quit us when we bid it farewell to enter upon
          immortality in the next.</p>
  <p>When Lady Isabel was Mr. Carlyle's wife, she had never
          wholly loved him. The very utmost homage that
          esteem, admiration, affection, could give, was his;
          but that mysterious passion called by the name of
          love (and <pb n="253"/> which, as I truly and
          heartily believe, cannot in its refined etherealism
          be known to many of us) had not been given to him.
          It was now. I told you, some chapters back, that the
          world goes round by the rules of
          contrary—conter-rary, mind you, the children have it
          in their game—and we go round with it. We despise
          what we have, and covet that which we cannot get.
          From the very night she had come back to East Lynne,
          her love for Mr. Carlyle had burst forth with an
          intensity never before felt. It had been smouldering
          almost ever since she quitted him. "Reprehensible!"
          groans a moralist. Very. Everybody knows that, as
          Afy would say. But her heart, you see, had
            <hi>not</hi> done with human passions: and they
          work ill, and conterariness (let the word stand,
          critic, if you please), and precisely everything
          they should not.</p>
  <p>I shall get blame for it, I fear, if I attempt to defend
          her. But it was not exactly the same thing, as
          though she had suffered herself to fall in love with
          somebody else's husband. Nobody would defend
            <hi>that</hi> . We have not turned Mormons yet,
          and the world does not walk upon its head. When
          Queen Eleanor handed the bowl of poison to Fair
          Rosamond, she challenged the execrations of
          posterity, and they have been liberally bestowed
          upon her from that hour to this. The queen gets all
          the blame, the lady all the sympathy. Putting the
          poison out of view, I think the judgment should be
          reversed. Had Lady Isabel fallen in love with—say—
          Mr. Crosby, she would have deserved a little
          judicious chastisement at Mr. Crosby's hands.
          Perhaps an hour or two spent in some agreeable
          pillory might have proved efficacious. But this was
          a peculiar case. She, poor thing, almost regarded
          Mr. Carlyle as <hi>her</hi> husband. <pb n="254"/>
          The bent of her thoughts was only too much inclined
          to this. (That evil human heart again!) Many and
          many a time did she wake up from a reverie, and
          strive to drive this mistaken view of things away
          from her, taking shame to herself. Ten minutes
          afterwards, she would catch her brain revelling in
          the same rebellious vision. Mr. Carlyle's love was
          not hers now; it was Barbara's: Mr. Carlyle did not
          belong to her; he belonged to his wife. It was not
          only that he was not hers; he was another's: you may
          therefore, if you have the pleasure of being
          experienced in this sort of thing, guess a little at
          what her inward life was. Had there been no Barbara
          in the case, she might have lived and borne it: as
          it was, it had killed her before her time; that, and
          the remorse together.</p>
  <p>There had been other things, too. The reappearance of
          Francis Levison at West Lynne, in fresh contact, as
          may be said, with herself, had struck terror to her
          heart; and the dark charge brought against him
          awfully augmented her remorse. Then, the sharp
          lances perpetually thrust upon her memory—the Lady
          Isabel's memory—from all sides, were full of cruel
          stings, unintentionally though they were hurled. And
          there was the hourly chance of discovery, and the
          never-ceasing battle with her conscience for being
          at East Lynne at all. No wonder that the chords of
          life were snapping: the wonder would have been had
          they remained whole.</p>
  <p>"She brought it upon herself! she ought not to have come
          back to East Lynne!" groans our moralist again.
          Don't I say so? Of course she ought not. Neither
          ought she to have suffered her thoughts to stray, in
          the manner they did, towards Mr. Carlyle. She ought
          not; but she did. If we all did just what <pb n="255"/> we "ought," this lower world would be
          worth living in. You must just sit down and abuse
          her, and so cool your anger. I agree with you that
          she ought never to have come back; that it was an
          act little short of madness: but are you quite sure
          that you would not have done the same, under the
          facility and the temptation? And now you can abuse
          me for saying it, if it will afford you any
          satisfaction.</p>
  <p>She was nearer to death than she imagined. She
          knew—judging by her declining strength, and her
          inner feelings—that it could not be far off; but she
          did not deem it was coming so very soon. Her mother
          had died in a similar way. Some said of consumption
          —Dr. Martin said so, you may remember; some said of
          "waste;" the earl, her husband, said of a broken
          heart—you heard him say so to Mr. Carlyle in the
          first chapter of this history. The earl was the one
          who might be supposed to know best. Whatever may
          have been Lady Mount Severn's malady, she—to give
          you the phrase that was in people's mouths at the
          time —"went out like the snuff of a candle." It was
          now the turn of Lady Isabel. She had no decided
          disorder, yet Death had marked her. She felt that it
          was so: and in the approach of Death she dreaded
          not, as she had once done, the consequences that
          must ensue, did discovery come. Which brings us back
          to the point whence ensued this long digression. I
          dare say you are chafing at it, but it is not often
          I trouble you with one.</p>
  <p>But she would not willingly let discovery come; neither
          had she the least intention of remaining at East
          Lynne to die. Where she should take refuge, was
          quite a secondary consideration: only let her get
            <pb n="256"/> smoothly and plausibly away. Joyce,
          in her dread, was for ever urging it. Of course the
          preliminary step was, to arrange matters with Mrs.
          Carlyle, and in the afternoon of the day following
          the funeral, Lady Isabel proceeded to her
          dressing-room, and craved an interview.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle quitted the room as she entered it. Barbara,
          fatigued with a recent drive, was lying on the
          sofa.</p>
  <p>"We shall be so sorry to lose you, Madame Vine! You are
          all we could wish for Lucy: and Mr. Carlyle feels
          truly grateful for your love and attention to his
          poor boy."</p>
  <p>"To leave will give me pain also," Madame Vine answered,
          in a subdued tone. Pain? Ay. Mrs. Carlyle little
          guessed at its extent. All she cared for on earth,
          she should leave behind her at East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Indeed you must not leave," resumed Barbara. "It would
          be unjust to allow you to do so. You have made
          yourself ill, waiting upon poor William, and you
          must remain here and take holiday until you are
          cured. You will soon get well, if you will only
          suffer yourself to be properly waited on and taken
          care of."</p>
  <p>"You are very considerate. Pray do not think me
          insensible if I decline. I believe my strength is
          beyond getting up: that I shall never be able to
          teach again."</p>
  <p>"Oh, nonsense," said Barbara, in her quick way. "We are
          all given to fancy the worst when we are ill. I was
          feeling terribly weak, only a few minutes ago, aud
          said something of the same sort to Archibald. He
          talked and soothed me out of it. I wish you had your
            <pb n="257"/> dear husband living, Madame Vine, to
          support you and love you; as I have him."</p>
  <p>A tinge of scarlet streaked Madame Vine's pale face, and
          she laid her hand upon her beating heart.</p>
  <p>"How could you think of leaving? We should be glad to
          help re-establish your health, in any case, but it
          is only fair to do it now. I felt sure, by the news
          brought to me when I was ill, that your attention
          upon William was overtaxing your strength."</p>
  <p>"It is not the attendance upon William that has brought
          me into this state," was the quick answer. "I
            <hi>must</hi> leave; I have well considered it
          over."</p>
  <p>"Would you like to go to the sea-side?" exclaimed
          Barbara, with sudden energy. "I am going there on
          Monday next: Mr. Carlyle insists upon it that I try
          a little change. I had intended only to take my
          baby; but we can make different arrangements and
          take you and Lucy. It might do you good, Madame
          Vine."</p>
  <p>She shook her head. "No: it would make me worse. All that
          I want is perfect quiet. I must beg you to
          understand that I shall leave. And I should be glad
          if you could allow the customary notice to be
          dispensed with, so that I may be at liberty to
          depart within a few days."</p>
  <p>"Look here, then," said Barbara, after a pause of
          consideration; "you remain at East Lynne until my
          return—which will be in a fortnight. Mr. Carlyle
          cannot stay with me, so I know I shall be tired in
          less time that. He and his office are quite
          overwhelmed with business, after his long sojourn in
          London. I did not care to go until August or
          September, when he will be at leisure, but he would
          not hear of it, and says we can go again then. I do
          not want you to remain to <pb n="258"/> teach, you
          know, Madame Vine: I do not wish you to do a single
          thing. Lucy shall have holiday, and Mr. Kane can
          come up for her music. Only, I could not be content
          to leave her, unless under your surveillance: she is
          getting of an age, now, not to be consigned to
          servants, not even to Joyce. Upon my return, if you
          still wish to leave, you shall then be at liberty to
          do so. What do you say?"</p>
  <p>Madame Vine said "Yes." Said it eagerly. To have another
          fortnight with her children, Lucy and Archibald, was
          very like a reprieve, and she embraced it. Although
          she knew, as I have said, that grim death was on his
          way, she did not think he had drawn so near the end
          of his journey. Her thoughts went back to the time
          when <hi>she</hi> had been ordered to the sea-side
          after an illness. It had been a marvel if they had
          not. She remembered how her husband had urged the
          change upon her: how he had taken her, travelling
          carefully; how tenderly anxious he had been in the
          arrangements for her comfort, when settling her in
          the lodgings; how, when he came again to see her, he
          had met her in his passionate fondness, thanking God
          for the visible improvement in her looks. That one
          injunction, which she had called him back to give
          him, as he was departing for the boat, was bitterly
          present to her now: "Do not get making love to
          Barbara Hare." All this care, and love, and
          tenderness, belonged now of right to Barbara; and
          were given to her.</p>
  <p>Now Barbara, although she pressed Madame Vine to remain
          at East Lynne, and indeed would have been glad that
          she should do so, did not take her refusal to heart.
          Barbara could not fail to perceive that she was <pb n="259"/> a thoroughly refined gentlewoman, far
          superior to the generality of governesses. That she
          was also truly fond of Lucy, and most anxious for
          her welfare in every way, Barbara also saw. For
          Lucy's sake, therefore, she would be grieved to part
          with Madame Vine, and would raise her salary to
          anything in reason, if she would but stay. But, on
          her own score, Barbara had as soon Madame Vine went,
          as not; for, in her heart of hearts, she had never
          liked her. She could not have told why. Was it
          instinct? Very probably. The birds of the air, the
          beasts of the field, the fishes of the sea have
          their instincts; and man has his. Perhaps it was the
          unaccountable resemblance that Madame Vine bore to
          Lady Isabel. A strange likeness, Barbara often
          thought: but whether it lay in the face, the voice,
          or the manner, she could never decide. A suspicion
          of the truth did not cross her mind. How should it?
          And she never spoke of it: had the resemblance been
          to any one but Lady Isabel, she would have talked of
          it freely. Or, it may have been that there was now
          and then a tone in Madame Vine's voice that grated
          on her ear: a wrung, impatient tone, wanting in
          respect, savouring of hauteur, which Barbara did not
          understand, and did not like. However it may have
          been, certain it is that Mrs. Carlyle would not shed
          tears after the governess. Only for Lucy's sake did
          she regret parting with her.</p>
  <p>These different remembrances and reflections were
          separately passing through the minds of the two
          ladies, when Madame Vine at length rose from her
          chair to depart.</p>
  <p>"Would you mind holding my baby for one minute?" cried
          Barbara.</p>
  <pb n="260"/>
  <p>Madame Vine quite started. "The baby there!" she uttered.
          Barbara laughed.</p>
  <p>"It is lying by my side, under the shawl, quiet, little
          sleeping thing."</p>
  <p>Madame Vine advanced and took the sleeping baby. How
          could she refuse? She had never had it in her arms
          before: had, in fact, scarcely seen it. One visit of
          ceremony she had paid Mrs. Carlyle, as in politeness
          bound, a day or two after the young lady's arrival,
          and had been shown a little face, nearly covered
          with lace, in a cradle.</p>
  <p>"Thank you. I can get up now. I might have half smothered
          it, had I attempted before," continued Barbara,
          still laughing. "I have been here long enough, and
          am quite rested. Talking about smothering children,
          what accounts we have in the registrar-general's
          weekly returns of health. So many children 'overlaid
          in bed;' so many children 'suffocated in bed.' One
          week there were nearly twenty; and often there are
          as many as eight and ten. Mr. Carlyle says he knows
          they are smothered on purpose."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Mrs. Carlyle!"</p>
  <p>"I exclaimed, just as you do, when he said it, and laid
          my hand over his lips. He laughed, and told me I did
          not know half the wickedness of the world. Thank
          you," again repeated Mrs. Carlyle, taking her child
          from Lady Isabel. "Is she not a pretty baby? Do you
          like the name: Anna?"</p>
  <p>"It is a simple name," replied Lady Isabel. "And simple
          names are always the most attractive."</p>
  <p>"That is just what Archibald thinks. But he wanted this
          child's to be Barbara. I would not have had it
          Barbara for the world. I remember his once <pb n="261"/> saying, a long, long while ago, that he
          did not like elaborate names; they were mouthfuls;
          and he instanced mine, and his sister's, and his
          own. I recalled his words to him, and he said he may
          not have liked the name of Barbara then, but he
          loved it now. So we entered into a compromise; Miss
          Baby was named Anna Barbara, with an understanding
          that the first name is to be for use, and the last
          for the registers."</p>
  <p>"It is not christened," said Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Only baptised. We should have had it christened before
          now, but for William's death. Not that we give
          christening dinners; but I waited for the trial at
          Lynneborough to be over, that my dear brother
          Richard might stand to the child."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle does not like christenings made into
          festivals," Lady Isabel dreamily observed, her
          thoughts buried in the past.</p>
  <p>"How did you know that?" exclaimed Barbara, opening her
          eyes. And poor Madame Vine, her pale face flushing,
          had to stammer forth some confused words that "she
          had heard so somewhere."</p>
  <p>"It is quite true," said Barbara. "He has never given a
          christening dinner for any of his children. He
          cannot understand the analogy between a solemn
          religious rite, and the meeting together afterwards
          to eat and drink and make merry, according to the
          fashion of this world."</p>
  <p>As Lady Isabel quitted the room, young Vane was careering
          through the corridor, throwing his head in all
          directions, and calling out.</p>
  <p>"Lucy! I want Lucy."</p>
  <p>"What do you want with her?" asked Madame Vine.</p>
  <pb n="262"/>
  <p>" <hi>Il m'est impossible de vous le dire, madame</hi> ,"
          responded he. Being, for an Eton boy, wonderfully up
          in French, he was rather given to show it off, when
          he got the chance. He did not owe it to Eton: Lady
          Mount Severn had taken better care than that. Better
          care? What could she want? There was one whole real
          live French tutor—and he an Englishman!—for the
          eight hundred boys. Very unreasonable of her
          ladyship to disparage that ample provision!</p>
  <p>"Lucy cannot come to you just now. She is
          practising."</p>
  <p>" <hi>Mais, il le faut. J'ai le droit de demander après
            elle. Elle m'appartient, vous comprenez, madame,
            cette demoiselle-là</hi> ."</p>
  <p>Madame could not forbear a smile. "I wish you would speak
          English sense, instead of French nonsense."</p>
  <p>"Then the English sense is, that I want Lucy, and I must
          have her. I am going to take her for a drive in the
          pony-carriage if you must know. She said she would
          come, and John is getting it ready."</p>
  <p>"I could not possibly allow it," said Madame Vine. "You
          would be sure to upset her."</p>
  <p>"The idea!" he returned, indignantly. "As if I should
          upset Lucy! Why, I am one of the great whips at
          Eton! I care for Lucy too much not to drive
          steadily. She is to be my wife, you know, <hi>ma
            bonne dame</hi> ."</p>
  <p>At this juncture, two heads were pushed out from the
          library, close by: those of the earl and Mr.
          Carlyle. Barbara also, attracted by the talking,
          appeared at the door of her dressing-room.</p>
  <pb n="263"/>
  <p>"What's that, about a wife?" asked my lord, of his
          son.</p>
  <p>The blood mantled in the young gentleman's cheeks, as he
          turned round and saw who spoke. But he possessed all
          the fearlessness of an Eton boy, the honour of a
          right mind; and he disdained to equivocate.</p>
  <p>"I intend Lucy Carlyle to be my wife, papa. I mean, in
          earnest—when we shall both be grown up. If you will
          approve, and Mr. Carlyle will give her to me."</p>
  <p>The earl looked grave: Mr. Carlyle, amused. "Suppose,"
          said the latter, "we adjourn the discussion to this
          day ten years?"</p>
  <p>"But that Lucy is so very young a child, I should reprove
          you seriously, sir," said the earl. "You have no
          right to bring Lucy's name into any such
          absurdity."</p>
  <p>"I mean it, papa: you'll all see. And I intend to keep
          out of scrapes—that is, of nasty dishonourable
          scrapes—on purpose that Mr. Carlyle shall find no
          excuse against me. I have made up my mind to be what
          he is—a man of honour. I am right glad you know
          about it, sir. And I shall let mamma know it, before
          long."</p>
  <p>The last sentence tickled the earl's fancy, and a grim
          smile passed over his lips. "It will be war to the
          knife, if you do."</p>
  <p>"I know that," laughed the viscount. "But I am getting a
          better match for mamma in our battles than I used to
          be."</p>
  <p>Nobody saw fit to prolong the discussion. Barbara put her
          veto upon the drive in the pony-carriage, unless
          John sat behind to look after the driver, which Lord
          Vane's skill resented as an insult. Madame Vine, <pb n="264"/> when the corridor became empty again,
          laid her hand upon the boy's arm, as he was moving
          away, and drew him to the window.</p>
  <p>"In speaking, as you do, of Lucy Carlyle, do you forget
          the disgrace reflected on her through the conduct of
          her mother?"</p>
  <p>"Her mother is not Lucy."</p>
  <p>"It may prove an impediment with Lord and Lady Mount
          Severn."</p>
  <p>"Not with his lordship. And I must do—as you heard me
          say—battle with my mother. Conciliatory battle, you
          understand, madame; bringing the enemy to
          reason."</p>
  <p>Madame Vine was agitated. She held her handkerchief to
          her mouth and the boy noticed how her hands
          trembled.</p>
  <p>"I have learnt to love Lucy," said she. "It has appeared
          to me, in these few months' sojourn with her, that I
          have stood to her in the light of a mother. William
          Vane," she solemnly added, keeping her hold upon
          him, "I shall soon be where earthly distinctions are
          no more; where sin and sorrow are wiped away. Should
          Lucy Carlyle indeed become your wife in after years,
          never, never cast upon her, by so much as the
          lightest word of reproach, the sin of Lady
          Isabel."</p>
  <p>Lord Vane threw back his head, his honest eyes flashing
          in their indignant earnestness.</p>
  <p>"What do you take me for?"</p>
  <p>"It would be a cruel wrong upon Lucy. She does not
          deserve it. That unhappy lady's sin was all her own:
          let it die with her. Never speak to Lucy of her
          mother."</p>
  <p>The lad dashed his hand across his eyes, for they <pb n="265"/> were filling. "I shall. I shall speak to
          her often of her mother—that is, you know, after
          she's my wife. I shall tell how I loved Lady
          Isabel—that there's nobody I ever loved so much in
          the world, but Lucy herself. <hi>I</hi> cast a
          reproach to Lucy on the score of her mother!" he
          hotly added. "It is through her mother that I love
          her. You don't understand, madame."</p>
  <p>"Cherish and love her for ever, should she become yours,"
          said Lady Isabel, wringing his hand. "I ask this as
          one who is dying."</p>
  <p>"I will. I promise it. But, I sav, madame," he continued,
          dropping his fervent tone, "to what do you allude?
          Are you worse?"</p>
  <p>Madame Vine did not answer. She glided away without
          speaking.</p>
  <p>When she was sitting that evening by twilight in the grey
          parlour, cold and shivering, and wrapped up in a
          shawl, though it was hot summer weather, somebody
          knocked at the door.</p>
  <p>"Come in," cried she, apathetically.</p>
  <p>It was Mr. Carlyle who entered. She rose up, her pulses
          quickening, her heart throbbing against her side. In
          her wild confusion, she was drawing forward a chair
          for him. He laid his hand upon it, and motioned her
          to her own.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Carlyle tells me that you have been speaking to her
          of leaving. That you find yourself too much out of
          health to continue with us."</p>
  <p>"Yes, sir," she faintly replied, having a most imperfect
          notion of what she did say.</p>
  <p>"What is it that you find to be the matter with you?"</p>
  <p>"I—think—it is chiefly weakness," she stammered.</p>
  <pb n="266"/>
  <p>Her face had grown as grey as the walls. A dusky, livid
          sort of hue, not unlike that which William's had
          worn, the night of his death, and her voice sounded
          strangely hollow. The voice struck Mr. Carlyle, and
          awoke his fears.</p>
  <p>"You cannot—you never can have caught William's
          complaint, in your close attendance on him!" he
          exclaimed, speaking in the impulse of the moment, as
          the idea flashed across him. "I have heard of such
          things."</p>
  <p>"Caught it from him!" she rejoined, carried away also by
          impulse. "It is more likely that he—"</p>
  <p>She stopped herself just in time. " <hi>Inherited it from
            me</hi> ," had been the destined conclusion. In
          her alarm, she went off volubly, something to the
          effect that "it was no wonder she was ill; illness
          was natural to her family."</p>
  <p>"At any rate, you have become ill at East Lynne, in
          attendance on my children," rejoined Mr. Carlyle
          decisively, when her voice died away, "you must
          therefore allow me to insist that you permit East
          Lynne to do what it can towards renovating you. What
          is your objection to see a doctor?"</p>
  <p>"A doctor could do me no good," she faintly answered.</p>
  <p>"Certainly not—so long as you will not consult one."</p>
  <p>"Indeed, sir, doctors could not cure me. Nor—as I
          believe—prolong my life."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle paused. "Do you believe yourself to be in
          danger?"</p>
  <p>"Not in immediate danger, sir. Only in-so-far that I know
          I shall not live long."</p>
  <p>"And yet you will not see a doctor! Madame Vine, you must
          be aware that I could not permit such a thing <pb n="267"/> to go on in my house. Dangerous illness,
          and no advice!"</p>
  <p>She could not say to him, "My malady is on the mind; it
          is a breaking heart, and therefore no doctor of
          physic could serve me." That would never do. She had
          sat with her hand across her face, between her
          spectacles, and her wrapped-up chin. Had Mr. Carlyle
          possessed the eyes of Argus, he could not have made
          anything of her features in the broad light of day.
          But <hi>she</hi> did not feel so sure of it. There
          was always an undefined terror of discovery when in
          his presence, and she wished the interview at an
          end.</p>
  <p>"I will see Mr. Wainwright, if it will be any
          satisfaction to you, sir."</p>
  <p>"Madame Vine, I have intruded upon you here, to say that
          you <hi>must</hi> see him. And, should he deem it
          necessary, Dr. Martin also."</p>
  <p>"Oh, sir," she rejoined with a curious smile, "Mr.
          Wainwright will be quite sufficient. There will be
          no need of another. I will write a note to him
          to-morrow."</p>
  <p>"Spare yourself the trouble. I am going into West Lynne,
          and will send him up. You will permit me to urge
          that you spare no pains or care—that you suffer my
          servants to spare no pains or care to re-establish
          your health. Mrs. Carlyle tells me that the question
          of your leaving remains in abeyance until her
          return—"</p>
  <p>"Pardon me sir. The understanding with Mrs. Carlyle was,
          that I should remain here until her return, and
          should then be at liberty at once to leave."</p>
  <p>"Exactly. That is what Mrs. Carlyle said. But I must
          express a hope that by that time you may be feeling
          so much better as to reconsider your decision, <pb n="268"/> and continue with us. For my daughter's
          sake, Madame Vine, I trust it will be so."</p>
  <p>He rose as he spoke, and held out his hand. What could
          she do but rise also, drop hers from her face, and
          give it him in answer? He retained it, clasping it
          warmly.</p>
  <p>"How shall I repay you; how thank you for your love to my
          poor lost boy?"</p>
  <p>His earnest, tender eyes were on her double-spectacles; a
          sad smile mingled with the sweet expression of his
          lips, as he bent towards her—lips that had once been
          hers! A faint exclamation of despair; a vivid glow
          of hot crimson; and she caught up her new black silk
          apron, so deeply bordered with crape, in her
          disengaged hand, and flung it up to her face. He
          mistook the sound; mistook the action.</p>
  <p>"Do not grieve for him. He is at rest. Thank you, thank
          you greatly for all your sympathy."</p>
  <p>Another wring of her hand, and Mr. Carlyle had quitted
          the room. She laid her head upon the table, and
          thought how merciful would be death when he should
          come.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XXII. IT WON'T DO, AFY.</head>
  <p><hi>Mr Jiffin</hi> was in his glory. Mr. Jiffin's house
          was the same. Both were in apple-pie readiness to
          receive Miss Afy Hallijohn, who was, in a very short
          period indeed, to be converted into Mrs. Jiffin.</p>
  <p>Mr. Jiffin had not seen Afy for some days: had never been
          able to come across her since the trial at
          Lynneborough. Every evening had he danced attendance
          at her lodgings, but could not get admitted. "Not at
          home; not at home," was the invariable answer,
          though Afy might be sunning herself at the window in
          his very sight. Mr. Jiffin, throwing off as he best
          could the temporary disappointment, was in an
          ecstasy of admiration, for he set it all down to
          Afy's retiring modesty on the approach of the
          nuptial day. "And they could try to calumniate her!"
          he indignantly breathed.</p>
  <p>But now, one afternoon, when Mr. Jiffin, and his shopman,
          and his shop, and his wares were all set out to the
          best advantage, and very tempting they looked as a
          whole, especially the spiced bacon, Mr. Jiffin,
          happening to cast his eyes to the opposite side of
          the street, beheld his beloved sailing by. She was
          got up in the fashion. A mauve silk dress with
          eighteen flounces, and about eighteen hundred steel
          buttons that glittered <pb n="270"/> your sight
          away; a "zouave" jacket, worked with gold; a black
          straw hat with no visible brim perched on the top of
          her skull, garnished in front with what court
          milliners are pleased to term a "plume de coq," but
          which, by its size and height, might have been taken
          for a "coq" himself, while a white ostrich feather
          was carried round and did duty behind, and a
          spangled hair-net hung down to her waist. Gloriously
          grand was Afy that day; and if I had but a
          photographing machine at hand—or whatever may be the
          scientific name for the thing—you should certainly
          have been regaled with the sight of her. Joyce would
          have gone down in a fit, had she encountered her by
          any unhappy chance. Mr. Jiffin, dashing his apron
          anywhere, tore across.</p>
  <p>"Oh, is it you?" said Afy, freezingly, when compelled to
          acknowledge him, but his offered hand she utterly
          repudiated. "Really, Mr. Jiffin, I should feel
          obliged if you would not come out to me in this
          offensive and public manner."</p>
  <p>Mr. Jiffin grew cold. "Offensive! Not come out!" gasped
          he. "I do trust I have not been so unfortunate as to
          offend you, Miss Afy!"</p>
  <p>"Well—you see," said Afy, calling up all her impudence to
          say what she had made up her mind to say, "I have
          been considering it well over, Jiffin, and I find
          that to carry out the marriage will not be for my—
          for our happiness. I intended to write and inform
          you of this; but I shall be spared the trouble—as
          you <hi>have</hi> come out to me."</p>
  <p>The perspiration, cold as ice, began to pour off Mr.
          Jiffin in his agony and horror. You might have wrung
          every thread he had on. "You—don't—mean—to— <pb n="271"/> imply—that—you—give—me—up—Miss Afy?" he
          jerked out, unevenly.</p>
  <p>"Well; yes I do," replied Afy. "It's as good to be plain;
          and then there can be no misapprehension. I'll shake
          hands now with you, Jiffin, for the last time: and I
          am very sorry that we both made such a mistake."</p>
  <p>Poor Jiffin looked at her. His gaze would have melted a
          heart of stone. "Miss Afy, you <hi>can't</hi> mean
          it! You'd never, sure, crush a fellow in this
          manner, whose whole soul is yours; who trusted you
          entirely! There's not an earthly thing I would not
          do, to please you. You have been the—the light of my
          existence."</p>
  <p>"Of course," returned Afy, with a lofty and indifferent
          air, as if to be the "light of his existence" was
          only her due. "But it's all done, and over. It is
          not at all a settlement that will suit me, you see,
          Jiffin. A butter and bacon factor is so very—so
          very—what I have not been accustomed to!. And then,
          those aprons! I never could get reconciled to
          them."</p>
  <p>"I'll discard the aprons altogether," cried he, in a
          fever. "I'll get a second shopman, and buy a little
          gig, and do nothing but drive you out. I'll do
          anything if you will but have me still, Miss Afy. I
          have bought the ring, you know."</p>
  <p>"Your intentions are very kind," was the distant answer.
          "But it's a thing impossible: my mind is fully made
          up. So farewell for good, Jiffin: and I wish you
          better luck in your next venture."</p>
  <p>Afy, lifting her capacious dress, for the streets had
          just been watered, minced off. And Mr. Joe Jiffin,
          wiping his wet face as he gazed after her, insanely
            <pb n="272"/> wished that he could be nailed up in
          one of his pickled pork barrels, and so be put out
          of his misery.</p>
  <p>"That's done with, thank goodness!" soliloquised Afy.
          "Have <hi>him</hi> , indeed! after what Richard Hare
          let out on the trial. As if I should now look after
          anybody less than Dick! I shall get him, too.
          Telling to the judge's face that he only wanted to
          make me his honourable wife. I always knew Dick Hare
          loved me above everything else on earth: and he does
          still, or he'd never have said what he did, in open
          court. It's better to be born lucky than rich. Won't
          West Lynne envy me! 'Mrs. Richard Hare, of the
          Grove!' Old Hare is on his last legs, and then Dick
          comes into his own. Mrs. Hare must have her jointure
          house elsewhere, for we shall want the Grove for
          ourselves. I wonder if Madame Barbara will
          condescend to recognise me? And that blessed Corny?
          I shall be a sort of cousin of Corny's then. I
          wonder how much Dick comes into?—three or four
          thousand a year. And to think that I had nearly
          escaped this by tying myself to that ape of a
          Jiffin! What sharks do get in our unsuspecting
          paths, in this world!"</p>
  <p>On went Afy, through West Lynne, till she arrived close
          to Mr. Justice Hare's. Then she paced slowly. It had
          been a frequent walk of hers, since the trial. Luck
          favoured her to-day. As she was passing the gate,
          Richard Hare came up from the direction of East
          Lynne. It was the first time Afy had obtained speech
          of him.</p>
  <p>"Good day, Mr. Richard. Why! you never were going to pass
          an old friend?"</p>
  <p>"I have so many friends," said Richard. "I can scarcely
          spare time for them, individually."</p>
  <pb n="273"/>
  <p>"But you might for me. Have you forgotten old days?"
          continued she, bridling and flirting, and altogether
          showing herself off to advantage.</p>
  <p>"No, I have not," replied Richard. "And I am not likely
          to do so," he pointedly added.</p>
  <p>"Ah, I felt sure of that. My heart told me so. When you
          went off, that dreadful night, leaving me to anguish
          and suspense, I thought I should have died. I have
          never had, so to say, a happy moment, until this,
          when I meet you again."</p>
  <p>"Don't be a fool, Afy!" was Richard's gallant rejoinder,
          borrowing the favourite reproach of Miss Carlyle. "I
          was young and green once: you don't suppose I have
          remained so. We will drop the past, if you please.
          How is Mr. Jiffin?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, the wretch!" shrieked Afy. "Is it possible you can
          have fallen into the popular scandal that I have
          anything to say to <hi>him?</hi> You know I'd never
          demean myself to it. That's West Lynne all over!
          nothing but inventions in it from week's end to
          week's end. A man who sells cheese! who cuts up
          bacon! Well, I am surprised at you, Mr.
          Richard!"</p>
  <p>"I have been thinking what luck you were in, to get him,"
          said Richard, with composure. "But it is your
          business; not mine."</p>
  <p>"Could <hi>you</hi> bear to see me stooping to him?"
          returned Afy, dropping her voice to the most
          insinuating whisper.</p>
  <p>"Look you, Afy. What ridiculous folly you are nursing in
          your head, I don't trouble myself to guess: but, the
          sooner you get it out again, the better. I was an
          idiot once, I don't deny it: but you cured me of
          that; and cured me with a vengeance. You must <pb n="274"/> pardon me for intimating that from
          henceforth we are strangers; in the street, as
          elsewhere. I have resumed my own standing again:
          which I perilled when I ran after you."</p>
  <p>Afy turned faint. "How can you speak these cruel words?"
          gasped she.</p>
  <p>"You have called them forth. I was told yesterday that
          Afy Hallijohn, dressed up to a caricature, was
          looking after me again. <hi>It won't do, Afy</hi>
          ."</p>
  <p>"Oh-o-o-o-oh!" sobbed Afy, growing hysterical, "and is
          this to be all my recompense for the years I have
          spent, pining after you? keeping single for your
          sake!"</p>
  <p>"Recompense! Oh, if you want that, I'll get my mother to
          give Jiffin her custom." And with a ringing laugh,
          which, though it had nothing of malice in it, showed
          Afy that he took her reproach for what it was worth,
          Richard turned in at his own gate.</p>
  <p>It was a deadly blow to Afy's vanity. The worst it had
          ever received: and she took a few minutes to compose
          herself, and smooth her ruffled feathers. Then she
          turned and sailed back towards Mr. Jiffin's, her
          turban up in the skies and the plume de coq tossing,
          to the admiration of all beholders, especially of
          Miss Carlyle, who had the gratification of surveying
          her from her window. Arrived at Mr. Jiffin's, she
          was taken ill exactly opposite his door, and
          staggered into the shop in a most exhausted
          state.</p>
  <p>Round the counter flew Mr. Jiffin, leaving the shopman,
          staring, behind it. What <hi>was</hi> the matter?
          What <hi>could</hi> he do for her?</p>
  <p>"Faint—heat of the sun—walked too fast—allowed <pb n="275"/> to sit down for five minutes!" gasped
          Afy, in disjointed sentences.</p>
  <p>Mr. Jiffin tenderly conducted her through the shop to his
          parlour. Afy cast half an eye round, saw how
          comfortable were its arrangements, and her symptoms
          of faintness increased. Gasps and hysterical sobs
          came forth together. Mr. Jiffin was as one upon
          spikes.</p>
  <p>"She'd recover better there than in the public shop— if
          she'd only excuse his bringing her in, and consent
          to stop in it a few minutes. No harm could come to
          her, and West Lynne could never say it. He'd stand
          at the far end of the room, right away from her:
          he'd prop open the two doors and the window: he'd
          call in the maid—anything she thought right. Should
          he get her a glass of wine?"</p>
  <p>Afy declined the wine by a gesture, and sat fanning
          herself, Mr. Jiffin looking on from a respectful
          distance. Gradually she grew composed; grew herself
          again. As she gained courage, Mr. Jiffin lost it,
          and he ventured upon some faint words of reproach,
          of remonstrance, touching her recent treatment of
          him.</p>
  <p>Afy burst into a laugh. "Did I not do it well?" she
          exclaimed. "I thought I'd play off a joke upon you,
          so I came out this afternoon and did it."</p>
  <p>Mr. Jiffin clasped his hands. " <hi>Was</hi> it a joke?"
          he returned, trembling with agitation, uncertain
          whether he was in paradise or not. "Are you still
          ready to let me call you mine?"</p>
  <p>"Of course it was a joke," said Afy. "What a soft you
          must have been, Mr. Jiffin, not to see through it!
          When young ladies engage themselves to be married,
          you can't suppose they run back from it, close upon
          the wedding-day!"</p>
  <pb n="276"/>
  <p>"Oh, Miss Afy!" and the poor little man actually burst
          into delicious tears, as he caught hold of Afy's
          hand and kissed it.</p>
  <p>"A great green donkey!" thought Afy to herself, bending
          on him, however the sweetest smile.</p>
  <p>Mr. Jiffin is not the only green donkey in the world.</p>
  <p>Richard Hare, meanwhile, had entered his mother's
          presence. She was sitting at the open window, the
          justice opposite to her, in an invalid-chair,
          basking in the air and the sun. This last attack of
          the justice's had affected the mind more than the
          body. He was brought down to the sitting-room that
          day for the first time; but, of his mind, there was
          little hope. It was in a state of half imbecility:
          the most wonderful characteristic being, that all
          its self-will, its surliness had gone. Almost as a
          little child in tractability, was Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>Richard came up to his mother, and kissed her. He had
          been to East Lynne. Mrs. Hare took his hand and
          fondly held it. The change in her was wonderful: she
          was a young and happy woman again.</p>
  <p>"Barbara has decided to go to the sea-side, mother. Mr.
          Carlyle takes her on Monday."</p>
  <p>"I am glad, my dear. It will be sure to do her good.
          Richard"—bending over to her husband, but still
          retaining her son's hand—"Barbara has agreed to go
          to the sea-side. It will set her up."</p>
  <p>"Ay, ay," nodded the justice, "set her up. Sea-side?
          Can't we go?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly, dear, if you wish it: when you shall be a
          little stronger."</p>
  <p>"Ay, ay," nodded the justice again. It was his usual
          answer now. "Stronger. Where's Barbara?"</p>
  <pb n="277"/>
  <p>"She goes on Monday, sir," said Richard, likewise bending
          his head. "Only for a fortnight. But they talk of
          going again later in the autumn."</p>
  <p>"Can't I go too?" repeated the justice, looking
          pleadingly in Richard's face.</p>
  <p>"You shall, dear father. Who knows but a month or two's
          bracing would bring you quite round again? We might
          go all together, ourselves and the Carlyles. Anne
          comes to stay with us next week, you know, and we
          might go when her visit is over."</p>
  <p>"Ay, all go together. Anne coming?"</p>
  <p>"Have you forgotten, dear Richard? She comes to stay a
          month with us, and Mr. Clitheroe and the children. I
          am so pleased she will find you better," added Mrs.
          Hare, her gentle eyes filling. "Mr. Wainwright says
          you may go out for a drive to-morrow."</p>
  <p>"And I'll be coachman," laughed Richard. "It will be the
          old times come round again. Do you remember, father,
          my breaking the pole, one moonlight night, and your
          not letting me drive for six months afterwards?"</p>
  <p>The poor justice laughed in answer to Richard, laughed
          till the tears ran down his face, probably not
          knowing in the least what he was laughing at.</p>
  <p>"Richard," said Mrs. Hare to her son, almost in an
          apprehensive tone, her hand pressing his, nervously,
          "was not that Afy Hallijohn I saw you speaking with
          at the gate?"</p>
  <p>"Did you see her? What a spectacle she had made of
          herself! I wonder she is not ashamed to go through
          the streets in such a guise! Indeed, I wonder she
          shows herself at all."</p>
  <pb n="278"/>
  <p>"Richard, you—you—will not be drawn in again?" were the
          next whispered words.</p>
  <p>"Mother!" There was a sternness in his mild blue eyes as
          he cast them upon his mother. Those beautiful eyes!
          the very counterpart of Barbara's; both his and hers
          the counterpart of Mrs. Hare's. The look had been
          sufficient refutation without words.</p>
  <p>"Mother mine, I am going to belong to you in future, and
          to nobody else. West Lynne is already busy for me, I
          understand, pleasantly carving out my destiny. One,
          marvels whether I shall lose myself again with Miss
          Afy; another, that I shall set on, offhand, and
          court Louisa Dobede. They are all wrong: my place
          will be with my darling mother—at least, for several
          years to come."</p>
  <p>She clasped his hand to her bosom in her glad
          delight.</p>
  <p>"We want happiness together, mother, to enable us to
          overget the past: for upon none did the blow fall,
          as upon you and upon me. And happiness we shall
          find, in this our own home, living for each other,
          and striving to amuse my poor father."</p>
  <p>"Ay, ay," complacently put in Justice Hare.</p>
  <p>"So it would be. Richard had returned to his home, had
          become, to all intents and purposes, its master: for
          the justice would never be in a state to hold sway
          again. He had reassumed his position; had regained
          the favour of West Lynne, which, always in extremes,
          was now wanting to kill him with kindness. A happy,
          happy home from henceforth: and Mrs. Hare lifted up
          her full heart in thankfulness to God. Perhaps
          Richard's went up also.</p>
  <p>One word, touching that wretched prisoner in the <pb n="279"/> condemned cell at Lynneborough. As you
          may have anticipated, the extreme sentence was not
          carried out. And—little favourite as Sir Francis is
          with you and with me—we can but admit that justice
          did not demand that it should be. That he had
          wilfully killed Hallijohn, was certain; but the act
          was committed in a moment of wild rage; it had not
          been premeditated. The sentence was commuted to
          penal servitude for life. A far more disgraceful one
          in the estimation of Sir Francis: a far more
          unwelcome one in the eyes of his wife. It is of no
          use to mince the truth. One little grain of comfort
          had penetrated to Lady Levison: the anticipation of
          the time when she and her ill-fated child should be
          alone, and could hide themselves in some hidden nook
          of the wide world: <hi>he</hi> , and his crime, and
          his end gone; forgotten. But it seems he was not to
          go, and be forgotten: she and the boy must be tied
          to him still: and she was lost in horror and
          rebellion.</p>
  <p>That man envied the dead Hallijohn, as he looked forth on
          the future. A cheering prospect, truly! The gay Sir
          Francis Levison working in chains with his gang!
          Where would his diamonds and his perfumed
          handkerchiefs and his white hands be then? After a
          time he might get a ticket of leave. He groaned in
          agony as the turnkey suggested it to him! A ticket
          of leave for <hi>him!</hi> Oh, why did they not hang
          him? he wailed forth as he closed his eyes to the
          dim light: to the light of the cell, you understand:
          he could not close them to the light of the future.
          No; never again: it shone out all too plainly,
          dazzling his brain as with a flame of living
          fire.</p>

  <head>CHAPTER XXIII. UNTIL ETERNITY.</head>
  <p><hi>Barbara</hi> was at the sea-side; and Lady Isabel was
          in her bed, dying. You remember the old French
          saying, "L'homme propose, et Dieu dispose." An
          exemplification of it was here.</p>
  <p>She, Lady Isabel, had consented to remain at East Lynne
          during Mrs. Carlyle's absence, on purpose that she
          might be with her children. But the object was
          frustrated: for Lucy and Archibald had been removed
          to Miss Carlyle's. It was Mr. Carlyle's arrangement.
          He thought the governess ought to have entire
          respite from all charge: and, that poor governess
          dared not say, Let them stay with me. Lady Isabel
          had also purposed to be safely away from East Lynne
          before the time came for her to die: but that time
          had advanced with giant strides, and the period for
          removal was past. She was going out as her mother
          had done, rapidly, unexpectedly "like the snuff of a
          candle." Wilson was in attendance on her mistress:
          Joyce remained at home.</p>
  <p>Barbara had chosen a watering-place near, not thirty
          miles off, so that Mr. Carlyle went there most
          evenings, returning to his office in the mornings.
          Thus he saw little of East Lynne, paying it one or
          two flying <pb n="281"/> visits only. From the
          Saturday to the Wednesday in the second week he did
          not come home at all; and it was in those few days
          that Lady Isabel had changed for the worse. On the
          Wednesday he was expected home, to dinner and to
          sleep.</p>
  <p>Joyce was in a state of frenzy—or next door to it. Lady
          Isabel was dying, and what would become of the
          ominous secret? A conviction, born of her fears, was
          on the girl's mind that, with death, the whole must
          become known: and, who was to foresee what blame
          might not be cast upon her, by her master and
          mistress, for not having disclosed it? She might be
          accused of having been an abettor in the plot from
          the first! Fifty times it was in Joyce's mind to
          send for Miss Carlyle, and tell her all.</p>
  <p>The afternoon was fast waning, and the spirit of Lady
          Isabel seemed to be waning with it. Joyce was in the
          room, in attendance upon her. She had been in a
          fainting state all day, but felt better now. She was
          partially raised in bed by pillows, a white cashmere
          shawl over her shoulders, her night-cap off, to
          allow as much air as possible to come to her: and
          the windows stood open.</p>
  <p>Footsteps sounded on the gravel, in the quiet stillness
          of the summer air. They penetrated even to her ear,
          for all her faculties were keen yet. Beloved
          footsteps: and a tinge of hectic rose to her cheeks.
          Joyce, who stood at the window, glanced out. It was
          Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Joyce!" came forth a cry from the bed, sharp and
          eager.</p>
  <p>Joyce turned round. "My lady?"</p>
  <p>"I should die happier if I might see him."</p>
  <pb n="282"/>
  <p>"See him!" uttered Joyce, doubting her own ears. "My
          lady! See <hi>him?</hi> Mr. Carlyle?"</p>
  <p>"What can it signify? I am already as one dead. Should I
          ask it, or wish it, think you, in rude life? The
          yearning has been upon me for days, Joyce: it is
          keeping death away."</p>
  <p>"It could not be, my lady," was the decisive answer. "It
          must not be. It is as a thing impossible."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel burst into tears. "I can't die for the
          trouble," she wailed. "You keep my children from me.
          They must not come, you say, lest I should betray
          myself. Now, you would keep my husband. Joyce,
          Joyce, let me see him!"</p>
  <p>Her husband! Poor thing! Joyce was in a maze of distress,
          though not the less firm. Her eyes were wet with
          tears: but she believed she should be infringing her
          allegiance to her mistress, did she bring Mr.
          Carlyle to the presence of his former wife:
          altogether it might be productive of nothing but
          confusion.</p>
  <p>A knock at the chamber door. Joyce called out, "Come in."
          The two maids, Hannah and Sarah, were alone in the
          habit of coming to the room, and neither of them had
          ever known Madame Vine as Lady Isabel. Sarah put in
          her head.</p>
  <p>"Master wants you, Mrs. Joyce."</p>
  <p>"I'll come."</p>
  <p>"He is in the dining-room. I have just taken down Master
          Arthur to him."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle had got "Master Arthur" on his shoulder when
          Joyce entered. Master Arthur was decidedly given to
          noise and rebellion, and was already, as Wilson
          expressed it, "sturdy upon his pins."</p>
  <p>"How is Madame Vime, Joyce?"</p>
  <pb n="283"/>
  <p>Joyce scarcely knew how to answer. But she did not dare
          equivocate as to her precarious state. And, where
          the use, when a few hours would probably see the end
          of it?</p>
  <p>"She is very ill indeed, sir."</p>
  <p>"Worse?"</p>
  <p>"Sir, I fear she is dying."</p>
  <p>"Mr. Carlyle, in his consternation, put down Arthur.
          "Dying!"</p>
  <p>"I hardly think she will last till morning, sir."</p>
  <p>"Why, what has killed her?" he uttered, in amazement.</p>
  <p>Joyce did not answer. She looked pale and confused.</p>
  <p>"Have you had Dr. Martin?"</p>
  <p>"Oh no, sir. It would be of no use."</p>
  <p>"No use!" repeated Mr. Carlyle, in a sharp accent. "Is
          that the way to treat dying people? Assume it is of
          no use to send for advice, and so, quietly let them
          die! If Madame Vine is as ill as you say, a
          telegraphic message must be sent off at once. I had
          better see her," he said, moving to the door.</p>
  <p>Joyce, in her perplexity, dared to place her back against
          it, preventing his egress. "Oh, master!—I beg your
          pardon, but—but—it would not be right. Please, sir,
          do not think of going into her room!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle thought Joyce was taken with a fit of
          prudery. "Why can't I go in?" he asked.</p>
  <p>"Mrs. Carlyle would not like it, sir," stammered Joyce,
          her cheeks scarlet now.</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle stared at her. "Some of you take up odd
          ideas," he cried. "In Mrs. Carlyle's absence, it is
          necessary that some one should see her. Let a lady
            <pb n="284"/> die in my house, and never see after
          her! You are out of your senses, Joyce. I shall go
          in after dinner; so prepare Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>The dinner was being brought in then. Joyce, feeling like
          one in a nervous attack, picked up Arthur and
          carried him to Sarah, in the nursery. What on earth
          was she to do?</p>
  <p>Scarcely had Mr. Carlyle begun his dinner, when his
          sister entered. Some grievance had arisen between
          her and the tenants of certain houses of hers, and
          she was bringing the dispute to him. Before he would
          hear it, he begged her to go up to Madame Vine,
          telling her what Joyce had said of her state.</p>
  <p>"Dying!" ejaculated Miss Corny, in disbelieving derision.
          "That Joyce has been more like a simpleton, lately,
          than like herself. I can't think what has come to
          the woman."</p>
  <p>She took off her bonnet and mantle, and laid them on a
          chair, gave a twitch or two to her cap, as she
          surveyed it in the pier-glass, and went up-stairs.
          Joyce answered her knock at the invalid's door: and
          Joyce, when she saw who it was, turned as white as
          any sheet.</p>
  <p>"Oh, ma'am! you must not come in!" she blundered out, in
          her confusion and fear, as she put herself right in
          the doorway.</p>
  <p>"Who is to keep me out?" demanded Miss Carlyle, after a
          pause of surprise, her tone one of quiet power.
          "Move away, girl. Joyce, I think your brain must be
          softening. What will you try at, next?"</p>
  <p>Joyce was powerless, both in right and strength, and she
          knew it. She knew there was no help, that Miss
          Carlyle would, and must, enter. She stood aside, <pb n="285"/> shivering, and passed out of the room as
          soon as Miss Carlyle was within it.</p>
  <p>Ah! there could no longer be concealment now! There she
          was, her pale face lying against the pillow, free
          from its disguising trappings. The band of grey
          velvet, the spectacles, the wraps for the throat and
          chin, the huge cap, all were gone. It was the face
          of Lady Isabel: changed, certainly, very very much;
          but still hers. The silvered hair fell on either
          side her face, as the silky curls had once fallen;
          the sweet, sad eyes were the eyes of yore.</p>
  <p>"Mercy be good to us!" uttered Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>They remained gazing at each other, both panting with
          emotion: yes, even Miss Carlyle. Though a wild
          suspicion had once crossed her brain that Madame
          Vine might be Lady Isabel, it had died away again,
          from the sheer improbability of the thing, as much
          as from the convincing proofs offered by Lord Mount
          Severn. Not but what Miss Carlyle had borne in mind
          the suspicion, and had been fond of tracing the
          likeness in Madame Vine's face.</p>
  <p>"How could you dare come back here?" she asked, her tone
          one of sad, soft wailing; not of reproach.</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel humbly crossed her attenuated hands upon her
          chest. "My children," she whispered: "how could I
          stay away from them? Have pity, Miss Carlyle! Don't
          reproach me! I am on my way to God, to answer for
          all my sins and sorrows."</p>
  <p>"I do not reproach you," said Miss Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I am so glad to go," she continued to murmur, her eyes
          of full of tears. "Jesus did not come, you know to
          save the good, like you: he came for the sake of us
          poor sinners. I tried to take up my Cross, as he
          bade <pb n="286"/> us, and bear it bravely for his
          sake; but its weight has killed me."</p>
  <p>The good, like you! Humbly, meekly, deferentially was it
          expressed, in all good faith and trust, as though
          Miss Corny were a sort of upper angel. Somehow the
          words grated on Miss Corny's ear; grated fiercely on
          her conscience. It came into her mind, then, as she
          stood there, that the harsh religion she had,
          through life, professed, was not the religion that
          would best bring peace to her dying bed.</p>
  <p>"Child," said she, drawing near to and leaning over Lady
          Isabel, "had <hi>I</hi> anything to do with sending
          you from East Lynne?"</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel shook her head and cast down her gaze, as she
          whispered: "You did not send me: you did not help to
          send me. I was not very happy with you, but that was
          not the cause of—of my going away. Forgive me, Miss
          Carlyle, forgive me!"</p>
  <p>"Thank God!" inwardly breathed Miss Corny. "Forgive
            <hi>me</hi> ," she said, aloud and in agitation,
          touching her hand. "I could have made your home
          happier, and I wish I had done it. I have wished it
          ever since you left it."</p>
  <p>Lady Isabel drew the hand in hers. "I want to see
          Archibald," she whispered, going back, in thought,
          to the old time and the old name. "I have prayed
          Joyce to bring him to me, and she will not. Only for
          a minute! just to hear him say he forgives me! What
          can it matter, now that I am as one lost to this
          world! I should die easier."</p>
  <p>Upon what impulse, or grounds, Miss Carlyle saw fit to
          accede to the request, cannot be told. Possibly she
          did not choose to refuse a death-bed prayer,
          possibly she <pb n="287"/> reasoned, as did Lady
          Isabel—what could it matter? She went to the door.
          Joyce was in the corridor, leaning against the wall,
          her apron up to her eyes. Miss Carlyle beckoned to
          her.</p>
  <p>"How long have you known of this?"</p>
  <p>"Since that night in the spring, when there was an alarm
          of fire. I saw her then, with nothing on her face,
          and knew her; though, at the first moment, I thought
          it was her ghost. Ma'am, I have just gone about
          since, like a ghost myself, from the fear."</p>
  <p>"Go and request your master to come up to me."</p>
  <p>"Oh, ma'am! Will it be well to tell him?" remonstrated
          Joyce. "Well that he should see her?"</p>
  <p>"Go and request your master to come to me," unequivocally
          repeated Miss Carlyle. "Are you mistress, Joyce, or
          am I?"</p>
  <p>Joyce went down. And brought Mr. Carlyle up from the
          dinner-table.</p>
  <p>"Is Madame Vine worse, Cornelia? Will she see me?"</p>
  <p>"She wishes to see you."</p>
  <p>Miss Carlyle opened the door as she spoke. He motioned to
          her to pass in first. "No," she said, "you had
          better see her alone."</p>
  <p>He was going in, when Joyce caught his arm. "Master!
          master! you ought to be prepared. Ma'am, won't you
          tell him?"</p>
  <p>He looked at them, thinking they must be moonstruck, for
          their conduct seemed inexplicable. Both were in
          evident agitation; an emotion Miss Carlyle was not
          given to. Her face and lips were twitching, but she
          kept a studied silence. Mr. Carlyle knitted his
          brow, and went into the chamber. They shut him
          in.</p>
  <pb n="288"/>
  <p>He walked gently at once to the bed, in his
          straightforward manner. "I am grieved, Madame
          Vine—"</p>
  <p>The words faltered on his tongue. Did he think, as Joyce
          had once done, that it was a ghost he saw? Certain
          it is, that his face and lips turned the hue of
          death, and he backed a few steps from the bed:
          though he was as little given to show emotion as man
          can well be. The falling hair, the sweet, mournful
          eyes, the hectic which his presence brought to her
          cheeks, told too plainly of the Lady Isabel.</p>
  <p>"Archibald!"</p>
  <p>She put out her trembling hand. She caught him ere he had
          drawn quite beyond her reach. He looked at her, he
          looked round the room, as does one awaking from a
          dream.</p>
  <p>"I could not die without your forgiveness," she murmured,
          her eyes falling before him as she thought of her
          past sin. "Do not turn from me! bear with me a
          little minute! Only say you forgive me, and I shall
          die in peace."</p>
  <p>"Isabel? Are you—are you—were you Madame Vine?" he cried,
          scarcely conscious of what he said.</p>
  <p>"Oh, forgive, forgive me! I did not die. I got well from
          that accident, but it changed me dreadfully: nobody
          knew me, and I came here as Madame Vine. I could not
          stay away. Archibald, forgive me!"</p>
  <p>His mind was in a whirl, his wits were scared away. The
          first clear thought that came thumping through his
          brain, was, that he must be a man of two wives. She
          noticed his perplexed silence.</p>
  <p>"I could not stay away from you and from my children. The
          longing for you was killing me," she reiterated
          wildly, like one talking in a fever. "I never knew a
          moment's peace after the mad act I was guilty <pb n="289"/> of, in quitting you. Not an hour had I
          departed, when my repentance set in; and, even then,
          I would have retracted and come back, but I did not
          know how. See what it has done for me!" tossing up
          her grey hair, holding out her attenuated wrists.
          "Oh forgive, forgive me! My sin was great, but my
          punishment was greater. It has been as one long
          scene of mortal agony."</p>
  <p>"Why did you go?" asked Mr. Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"Did you not know?"</p>
  <p>"No. It has always been a mystery to me."</p>
  <p>"I went, out of love for you."</p>
  <p>A shade of disdain crossed his lips. Was she equivocating
          to him on her death-bed?</p>
  <p>"Do not look in that way," she panted. "My strength is
          nearly gone; you must perceive that it is; and I do
          not, perhaps, express myself clearly. I loved you
          dearly, and I grew suspicious of you. I thought you
          were false and deceitful to me; that your love was
          all given to another; and, in my sore jealousy, I
          listened to the temptings of that bad man, who
          whispered to me of revenge. It was not so, was
          it?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle had regained his calmness; outwardly, at any
          rate. He stood by the side of the bed, looking down
          upon her, his arms crossed upon his chest, and his
          noble form raised to its full height.</p>
  <p>"Was it so?" she feverishly repeated.</p>
  <p>"Can you ask it?—knowing me as you did then; as you must
          have known me since? I never was false to you, in
          thought, in word, or in deed."</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald, I was mad, I was mad! I could not have
          done it in anything but madness. Surely you will
          forget and forgive!"</p>
  <pb n="290"/>
  <p>"I cannot forget. I have already forgiven."</p>
  <p>"Try and forget the dreadful time that has passed since
          that night!" she continued, the tears falling on her
          cheeks, as she held up to him one of her poor hot
          hands. "Let your thoughts go back to the days when
          you first knew me; when I was here, Isabel Vane, a
          happy girl with my father. At times I have lost
          myself in a moment's happiness in thinking of it. Do
          you remember how you grew to love me, though you
          thought you might not tell it me?—and how gentle you
          were with me when papa died?—and the hundred-pound
          note? Do you remember coming to Castle Marling, and
          my promising to be your wife?—and the first kiss you
          left upon my lips? And oh, Archibald! do you
          remember the loving days, after I was your wife?—
          how happy we were with each other?—do you remember,
          when Lucy was born we thought I should have died;
          and your joy, your thankfulness that God restored
          me? Do you remember all this?"</p>
  <p>Ay. He did remember it. He took that poor hand into his,
          retaining there its wasted fingers</p>
  <p>"Have you any reproach to cast to me?" he gently said,
          bending his head a little.</p>
  <p>"Reproach to you! To you who must be almost without
          reproach in the sight of heaven! you, who were ever
          loving to me, ever anxious for my welfare! When I
          think of what you were, and are, and how I requited
          you, I could sink into the earth with remorse and
          shame. My own sin I have surely expiated: I cannot
          expiate the shame I entailed upon you, and upon our
          children."</p>
  <p>Never. He felt it as keenly now, as he had felt it then.
          "Think what it has been for me!" she resumed; <pb n="291"/> and he was obliged to bend his ear to
          catch her gradually weakening tones. "To live in
          this house with your wife; to see your love for her;
          to watch the envied caresses that once were mine! I
          never loved you so passionately as I have done since
          I lost you. Think what it was, to watch William's
          decaying strength; to be alone with you in his dying
          hour, and not be able to say, He is my child as well
          as yours! When he lay dead, and the news went forth
          to the household, it was <hi>her</hi> petty grief
          you soothed; not mine; mine, his mother's. God alone
          knows how I have lived through it all: it has been
          to me as the bitterness of death."</p>
  <p>"Why did you come back?" was the response of Mr.
          Carlyle.</p>
  <p>"I have told you. I could not <hi>live</hi> , away from
          you and my children."</p>
  <p>"It was wrong. Wrong in all ways."</p>
  <p>"Wickedly wrong. You cannot think worse of it than I have
          done. But the consequences and the punishment would
          be mine alone, so long as I guarded against
          discovery. I never thought to stop here to die: but
          death seems to have come upon me with a leap, as it
          came to my mother."</p>
  <p>A pause of laboured breathing. Mr. Carlyle did not
          interrupt it.</p>
  <p>"All wrong, all wrong," she resumed: "this interview,
          with you, amongst the rest. And yet—I hardly know:
          it cannot hurt the new ties you have formed, for I
          am as one dead now to this world, hovering on the
          brink of the next. But you <hi>were</hi> my husband,
          Archibald; and, the last few days, I have longed for
          your forgiveness with a fevered longing. Oh! that
          the past could be blotted out! that I could wake up
            <pb n="292"/> and find it but a hideous dream;
          that I were here, as in the old days, in health and
          happiness, your ever-loving wife! Do <hi>you</hi>
          wish it?—that the dark past had never had
          place?"</p>
  <p>She put the question in a sharp, eager tone, gazing up to
          him with an anxious gaze, as though the answer must
          be one of life or death.</p>
  <p>"For your sake I wish it." Calm enough were the words
          spoken; and her eyes fell again, and a deep sigh
          came forth.</p>
  <p>"I am going to William. But Lucy and Archibald will be
          left. Oh, be ever kind to them! I pray you, visit
          not their mother's sin upon their heads! do not, in
          your love for your later children, lose your love
          for them!"</p>
  <p>"Have you seen anything in my conduct that could give
          rise to fears of this?" he returned, reproach
          mingling in his sad tone. "The children are dear to
          me as you once were."</p>
  <p>"As I once was. Ay! And as I might have been now."</p>
  <p>"Indeed you might," he answered, with emotion.</p>
  <p>"Archibald, I am on the very threshold of the next world.
          Will you not bless me—will you not say a word of
          love to me before I pass it? Let what I am, be
          blotted for the moment from your memory: think of
          me, if you can, as the innocent, timid child, whom
          you made your wife. Only a word of love! my heart is
          breaking for it."</p>
  <p>He leaned over her, he pushed aside the hair from her
          brow with his gentle hand, his tears dropping on her
          face. "You nearly broke mine when you left me,
          Isabel," he whispered. "May God bless you, and <pb n="293"/> take you to His Rest in heaven! May He
          so deal with me, as I now fully and freely forgive
          you!"</p>
  <p>Lower and lower bent he his head, until his breath nearly
          mingled with hers. But, suddenly, his face grew red
          with a scarlet flush, and he lifted it again. Did
          the form of one, then in a felon's cell at
          Lynneborough, thrust itself before him? or that of
          his absent and unconscious wife?</p>
  <p>"To His Rest in Heaven," she murmured, in the hollow
          tones of the departing. "Yes, yes: I know that God
          has forgiven me. Oh, what a struggle it has been!
          Nothing but bad feelings; rebellion, and sorrow, and
          repining; for a long while after I came back here:
          but Jesus prayed for me and helped me; and you know
          how merciful he is to the weary and heavy-laden. We
          shall meet again, Archibald, and live together for
          ever and for ever. But for that great hope, I could
          hardly die. William said mamma would be on the banks
          of the river, looking out for him: but it is William
          who is looking for me."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle released one of his hands; she had taken them
          both; and, with his own handkerchief, wiped the
          death-dew from her forehead.</p>
  <p>"It is no sin to anticipate it, Archibald. For there will
          be no marrying or giving in marriage in heaven:
          Christ has said so. Though we do not know how it
          will be. My sin will be remembered no more there,
          and we shall be together with our children for ever
          and for ever. Keep a little corner in your heart for
          your poor lost Isabel."</p>
  <p>"Yes, yes," he whispered.</p>
  <p>"Are you leaving me?" she uttered, in a wild tone of
          pain.</p>
  <pb n="294"/>
  <p>"You are growing faint, I perceive. I must call
          assistance."</p>
  <p>"Farewell, then; farewell, until eternity," she sighed,
          the tears raining from her eyes. "It is death I
          think; not faintness. Oh! but it is hard to part!
          Farewell, farewell, my once dear husband!"</p>
  <p>She rose her head from the pillow, excitement giving her
          strength; she clung to his arm; she lifted her face,
          in its sad yearning. Mr. Carlyle laid her tenderly
          down again, and suffered his lips to rest upon
          hers.</p>
  <p>"Until eternity," he whispered.</p>
  <p>She followed him with her eyes as he retreated, and
          watched him from the room; then turned her face to
          the wall. "It is over. Only God now."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle took an instant's counsel with himself,
          stopping at the head of the stairs to do it. Joyce,
          in obedience to a sign from him, had already gone
          into the sick chamber: his sister was standing at
          its door.</p>
  <p>"Cornelia."</p>
  <p>She followed him down into the dining-room.</p>
  <p>"You will remain here to-night? With <hi>her</hi> ."</p>
  <p>"Do you suppose I shouldn't?" crossly responded Miss
          Corny. "Where are you off to now?"</p>
  <p>"To the telegraph office, at present. To send for Lord
          Mount Severn."</p>
  <p>"What good can he do?"</p>
  <p>"None. But I shall send for him."</p>
  <p>"Can't one of the servants go just as well as you? You
          have not finished your dinner: hardly begun it."</p>
  <p>He turned his eyes on the dinner-table, in a mechanical
          sort of way, his mind wholly pre-occupied, made some
          remark in answer, which Miss Corny did not catch,
          and went out.</p>
  <pb n="295"/>
  <p>On his return his sister met him in the hall, drew him
          inside the nearest room, and closed the door. Lady
          Isabel was dead. Had been dead about ten
          minutes.</p>
  <p>"She never spoke after you left her, Archibald. There was
          a slight struggle at the last, a fighting for
          breath, otherwise she went off quite peacefully. I
          felt sure, when I first saw her this afternoon, that
          she could not last till midnight."</p>
  <pb n="296"/>
                                </div>
                                <div type="chapter">
  <head>CHAPTER XXIV. I. M. V.</head>
  <p><hi>Lord Mount Severn</hi> , wondering greatly what the
          urgent summons could mean, lost no time in obeying
          it, and was at East Lynne the following morning,
          early. Mr. Carlyle was in his carriage at the
          station; his close carriage; and, shut up in that,
          he made the communication to the earl as they drove
          to East Lynne.</p>
  <p>The earl could with difficulty believe it. Never had he
          been so utterly astonished. At first he really could
          not understand the tale.</p>
  <p>"Did she—did she—come back to your house to die?" he
          blundered. "You never took her in? I don't
          comprehend."</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle explained farther. And the earl at length
          understood. But he could not recover his perplexed
          astonishment.</p>
  <p>"What a mad act!—to come back here! Madame Vine! How on
          earth did she escape detection?"</p>
  <p>"She did escape it," said Mr. Carlyle. "The strange
          likeness Madame Vine possessed to my first wife
          often struck me as being marvellous, but I never
          suspected the truth. It was a likeness, and not a
          likeness; for every part of her face and form was
            <pb n="297"/> changed. Except her eyes: and those
          I never saw but through those disguising
          glasses."</p>
  <p>The earl wiped his hot face. The news had ruffled him in
          no measured degree. He felt angry with Isabel, dead
          though she was, and thankful that Mrs. Carlyle was
          away.</p>
  <p>"Will you see her?" whispered Mr. Carlyle, as they
          entered the house.</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>They went up to the death-chamber, Mr. Carlyle procuring
          the key. Very peaceful she looked now, her pale
          features composed under her white cap and bands.
          Miss Carlyle and Joyce had done all that was
          necessary: nobody else had been suffered to approach
          her. Lord Mount Severn leaned over her, tracing the
          former looks of Isabel: and the likeness grew upon
          him in a wonderful degree.</p>
  <p>"What did she die of?" he asked.</p>
  <p>"She said, a broken heart."</p>
  <p>"Ah!" said the earl. "The wonder is, that it did not
          break before. Poor thing! poor Isabel!" he added,
          touching her hand, "how she marred her own
          happiness! Carlyle, I suppose this is your
          wedding-ring?"</p>
  <p>Mr. Carlyle cast his eyes upon the ring. "Very
          probably."</p>
  <p>"To think of her never having discarded it!" remarked the
          earl, releasing the cold hand. "Well, I can hardly
          believe the tale now."</p>
  <p>He turned and quitted the room as he spoke. Mr. Carlyle
          looked steadfastly at the dead face for a minute or
          two, his fingers touching the forehead: but, what
          his thoughts or feelings may have been, none can
          tell. <pb n="298"/> Then he replaced the sheet over
          the face, and followed the earl.</p>
  <p>They descended in silence to the breakfast-room. Miss
          Carlyle was seated at the table waiting for them.
          "Where <hi>could</hi> all your eyes have been?"
          exclaimed the earl to her, after a few sentences,
          referring to the event, had passed.</p>
  <p>"Just where yours would have been," retorted Miss Corny,
          with a touch of her old temper. "You saw Madame Vine
          as well as we did."</p>
  <p>"But not continuously. Only two or three times in all.
          And I do not remember ever to have seen her without
          her bonnet and veil. That Carlyle should not have
          recognised her is almost beyond belief."</p>
  <p>"It <hi>seems</hi> so, to speak of it," said Miss Corny;
          "but facts are facts. She was young, gay, active,
          when she left here, upright as a dart, her dark hair
          drawn from her open brow and flowing on her neck,
          her cheeks like crimson paint, her face altogether
          beautiful. Madame Vine arrived here a pale, stooping
          woman, lame of one leg, <hi>shorter</hi> than Lady
          Isabel—and her figure stuffed out under those sacks
          of jackets. Not a bit, scarcely, of her forehead to
          be seen, for grey velvet and grey bands of hair; her
          head smothered under a close cap, large blue double
          spectacles hiding the eyes and their sides, and the
          throat tied up; the chin partially. The mouth was
          entirely altered in its character, and that upward
          scar, always so conspicuous, made it almost ugly.
          Then she had lost some of her front teeth, you know,
          and she lisped when she spoke. Take her for all in
          all," summed up Miss Carlyle, "she looked no more
          like the Isabel who went away from here than I look
          like Adam. Just get your dearest friend damaged <pb n="299"/> and disguised as she was, my lord, and
          see if you'd recognise him."</p>
  <p>The observation came home to Lord Mount Severn. A
          gentleman whom he knew well, had been so altered by
          a fearful accident, that little resemblance could be
          traced to his former self. In fact, his own family,
          could not recognise him: and <hi>he</hi> used no
          artificial disguises. It was a case in point, and,
          reader! I assure you that it is a true one.</p>
  <p>"It was the <hi>disguise</hi> that we ought to have
          suspected," quietly observed Mr. Carlyle. "The
          likeness was not sufficiently striking to cause
          suspicion."</p>
  <p>"But she turned the house from that scent as soon as she
          came into it," struck in Miss Corny. "Telling of the
          'neuralgic pains' that afflicted her head and face,
          rendering the guarding them from exposure necessary.
          Remember, Lord Mount Severn, that the Ducies had
          been with her in Germany, and had never suspected
          her. Remember also another thing: that, however
          great a likeness we may have detected, we could not
          and did not speak of it, one to another. Lady
          Isabel's name is never so much as whispered amongst
          us."</p>
  <p>"True; all true," said the earl.</p>
  <p>On the Friday, the following letter was despatched to
          Mrs. Carlyle:</p>
  <p>"My Dearest,—I find I shall not be able to get to you on
          Saturday afternoon, as I promised, but will leave
          here by the late train that night. Mind you don't
          sit up for me. Lord Mount Severn is here for a few
          days: he sends his regards to you.</p>
  <p>"And now, Barbara, prepare for news that will prove a
          shock. Madame Vine is dead. She grew rapidly <pb n="300"/> worse, they tell me, after our
          departure, and died on Wednesday night. I am glad
          you were away.</p>
  <p>"Love from the children. Lucy and Archie are still at
          Cornelia's; Arthur wearing out Sarah's legs in the
          nursery.</p>
  <p>"Ever yours, my dearest,</p>
  <p>" <hi>Archibald Carlyle.</hi> "</p>
  <p>Of course, as Madame Vine, the governess, died at Mr.
          Carlyle's house, he could not in courtesy do less
          than follow her to the grave. So decided West Lynne,
          when they found which way the wind was going to
          blow. Lord Mount Severn followed also, to keep him
          company, being on a visit to him. And very polite
          indeed of his lordship to do it! Condescending also!
          West Lynne remembered another funeral at which those
          two had been the only mourners—that of the late
          earl. By some curious coincidence, the French
          governess was buried close to the earl's grave. As
          good there as anywhere else, quoth West Lynne: there
          happened to be a vacant spot of ground.</p>
  <p>The funeral took place on the Saturday morning. A plain,
          respectable funeral. A hearse and pair, and mourning
          coach and pair, with a chariot for the Reverend Mr.
          Little. No pall-bearers, or mutes, or anything of
          that show-off kind, and no plumes on the horses,
          only on the hearse. West Lynne looked on with
          approbation, and conjectured that the governess had
          left sufficient money to bury herself: but of course
          that was Mr. Carlyle's affair, not West Lynne's.
          Quiet enough lay she in her last resting-place.</p>
  <p>They left her in it, the earl and Mr. Carlyle; and <pb n="301"/> entered the mourning-coach to be
          conveyed back again to East Lynne.</p>
  <p>"Just a little upright stone of white marble, two feet
          high by a foot and a half broad," remarked the earl,
          on their road, pursuing a topic they were speaking
          upon. "With the initials, I. V. and the date of the
          year. Nothing more. What do you think?"</p>
  <p>"I. M. V.," corrected Mr. Carlyle. "Yes."</p>
  <p>At that moment the bells of another church, not St.
          Jude's, broke out in a joyous peal, and the earl
          inclined his ear to listen.</p>
  <p>"What can they be ringing for?" he cried.</p>
  <p>They were ringing for a wedding. Afy Hallijohn, by the
          help of two clergymen and six bridesmaids (of whom
          you may be sure Joyce was <hi>not</hi> one), had
          just been converted into Mrs. Joe Jiffin. When Afy
          took a thing in her head, she somehow contrived to
          carry it through, and to bend even clergymen and
          bridesmaids to her will. Mr. Jiffin was blessed at
          last.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, the earl left East Lynne; and, somewhat
          later, Barbara arrived. Wilson scarcely gave her
          mistress time to step into the house before her, and
          she very nearly left the baby in the fly. Curiously
          anxious was Wilson to hear all particulars, as to
          what could have taken off that French governess. Mr.
          Carlyle was much surprised at their arrival.</p>
  <p>"How could I stay away, Archibald, even until Monday,
          after the news you sent me?" said Barbara. "What did
          she die of? It must have been awfully sudden."</p>
  <p>"I suppose so," was his dreamy answer. He was debating a
          question with himself, one he had thought over a
          good deal since Wednesday night. Should he, <pb n="302"/> or should he not, tell his wife? He
          would have preferred not to tell her: and, had the
          secret been confined to his own breast, he would
          decidedly not have done so. But it was known to
          three others: to Miss Carlyle, to Lord Mount Severn,
          and to Joyce. All trustworthy and of good intention:
          but it was impossible for Mr. Carlyle to make sure
          that not one of them would ever, through any chance
          unpremeditated word, let the secret come to the
          knowledge of Mrs. Carlyle. That would not do: if she
          must hear it at all, she must hear it from him, and
          at once. He took his course.</p>
  <p>"Are you ill, Archibald?" she asked, noting his face. It
          wore a pale, worn look.</p>
  <p>"I have something to tell you, Barbara," he answered,
          drawing her hand into his as they stood together.
          They were in her dressing-room, where she was taking
          off her things. "On Wednesday evening, when I got
          home to dinner, Joyce told me that she feared Madame
          Vine was dying: and I thought it right to see
          her."</p>
  <p>"Certainly," returned Barbara. "Quite right."</p>
  <p>"I went into her room, and I found that she was dying.
          But I found something else, Barbara. She was not
          Madame Vine."</p>
  <p>"Not Madame Vine!" echoed Barbara.</p>
  <p>"It was my former wife, Isabel Vane."</p>
  <p>Barbara's face flushed crimson, and then grew white as
          marble; and she drew her hand from Mr. Carlyle's. He
          did not appear to notice the movement, but stood
          with his elbow on the mantelpiece while he talked,
          giving her a rapid summary of the interview; not its
          details.</p>
  <p>"She could not stay away from her children," she <pb n="303"/> said, "and came back as Madame Vine.
          What with the effects of the railway accident in
          France, and those spectacles she wore, and her style
          of dress, and her grey hair, she felt secure in not
          being recognized. I am astonished now that she was
          not discovered. Were such a thing related to me I
          should refuse credence to it."</p>
  <p>Barbara's heart felt faint with its utter sickness, and
          she turned her face from the view of her husband.
          Her first confused thoughts were as Mr. Carlyle's
          had been —that she had been living in his house with
          another wife. "Did you suspect her?" she breathed,
          in a low tone.</p>
  <p>"Barbara! Had I suspected it, should I have allowed it to
          go on? She implored my forgiveness; for the past,
          and for having returned here; and I forgave her
          fully. I went to West Lynne to telegraph for Mount
          Severn. She was dead when I came back. She said her
          heart was broken. Barbara, we cannot wonder at
          it."</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Mr. Carlyle beg an to perceive that
          his wife a face was hidden from him.</p>
  <p>Still there was no reply. Mr. Carlyle took his arm from
          the mantelpiece, and moved so that he could see her
          countenance: a wan countenance then, telling of
          pain.</p>
  <p>He laid his hand upon her shoulder and made her look at
          him. "My dearest, what is this?"</p>
  <p>"Oh, Archibald!" she uttered, clasping her hands
          together, all her pent-up feelings bursting forth,
          and the tears streaming from her eyes, "has this
          taken your love from me?"</p>
  <p>He took both her hands in one of his, he put the <pb n="304"/> other round her waist and held her
          there, before him, never speaking, only looking
          gravely into her face. Who could look at its sincere
          truthfulness, at the sweet expression of his lips,
          and doubt him? Not Barbara.</p>
  <p>"I had thought my wife possessed entire trust in me."</p>
  <p>"Oh, I do, I do; you know I do. Forgive me, Archibald,"
          she softly whispered.</p>
  <p>"I deemed it better to impart this to you, Barbara. My
          darling, I have told it you in love."</p>
  <p>She was leaning on his breast, sobbing gently, her
          repentant face turned towards him. He held her there
          in his strong protection, his enduring
          tenderness.</p>
  <p>"My wife! my darling! now, and always."</p>
  <p>"It was a foolish feeling to cross my heart, Archibald.
          It is done with, and gone."</p>
  <p>"Never let it come back again, Barbara. Neither need her
          name be mentioned again between us. A barred name it
          has hitherto been: let it so continue."</p>
  <p>"Anything you will. My earnest wish is to please you; to
          be worthy of your esteem and love. Archibald," she
          timidly added, her eyelids drooping, as she made the
          confession, while the colour rose in her fair face,
          "there has been a feeling in my heart against your
          children, a sort of jealous feeling, can you
          understand, because they were hers; because she had
          once been your wife. I knew how wrong it was, and I
          have tried earnestly to subdue it. I have indeed,
          and I think it is nearly gone. I"—her voice sunk
          lower— "constantly pray to be helped to do it; to
          love them and care for them as if they were my own.
          It will come with time."</p>
  <pb n="305"/>
  <p>"Every good thing will come with time that we earnestly
          seek," said Mr. Carlyle. "Oh, Barbara, never
          forget—never forget that the only way to ensure
          peace in the end, is, to strive always to be doing
          right, unselfishly, under God."</p>
