    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
    <p>Bébée sprang out of bed at daybreak. She was sixteen.</p>
    <p>It seemed a very wonderful thing to be as much as that — sixteen — a woman quite.</p>
    <p>A cock was crowing under her lattice. He said how old you are! — how old you are! every time
     that he sounded his clarion.</p>
    <p>She opened the lattice and wished him good day, with a laugh. It was so pleasant to be woke
     by him, and to think that no one in all the world could ever call one a child any more.</p>
    <p>There was a kid bleating in the shed. There was a thrush singing in the dusk of the sycamore
     leaves. There was a calf lowing to its mother away there beyond the fence. There were dreamy
     muffled bells ringing in the distance from many steeples and belfries where the city was; they
     all said one thing, "How good it is to be so old as that — how good, how very good!"</p>
    <p>Bébée was very pretty.</p>
    <p>No one in all Brabant ever denied that. To look at her it seemed as if she had so lived among
     the flowers that she had grown like them, and only looked a bigger blossom — that was all.</p>
    <p>She wore two little wooden shoes and a little cotton cap, and a gray kirtle — linen in summer,
     serge in winter; but the little feet in the shoes were like rose leaves, and the cap was as
     white as a lily, and the gray kirtle was like the bark of the bough that the apple-blossom
     parts, and peeps out of, to blush in the sun.</p>
    <p>The flowers had been the only godmothers that she had ever had, and fairy godmothers too.</p>
    <p>The marigolds and the sunflowers had given her their ripe, rich gold to tint her hair; the
     lupins and irises had lent their azure to her eyes; the moss-rosebuds had made her pretty
     mouth; the arum lilies had uncurled their softness for her skin; and the lime-blossoms had
     given her their frank, fresh, innocent fragrance.</p>
    <p>The winds had blown, and the rains had rained, and the sun had shone on her, indeed, and had
     warmed the whiteness of her limbs, but they had only given to her body and her soul a hardy,
     breeze-blown freshness like that of a field cowslip.</p>
    <p>She had never been called anything but Bébée.</p>
    <p>One summer day Antoine Mäes — a French subject, but a Belgian by adoption and habit, an old man
     who got his meagre living by tilling the garden plot about his hut and selling flowers in the
     city squares — Antoine, going into Brussels for his day's trade, had seen a gray bundle floating
     among the water-lilies in the bit of water near his hut and had hooked it out to land, and
     found a year-old child in it, left to drown, no doubt, but saved by the lilies, and laughing
     gleefully at fate.</p>
    <p>Some lace-worker, blind with the pain of toil, or some peasant woman harder of heart than the
     oxen in her yoke, had left it there to drift away to death, not reckoning for the inward ripple
     of the current or the toughness of the lily leaves and stems.</p>
    <p>Old Antoine took it to his wife, and the wife, a childless and aged soul, begged leave to
     keep it; and the two poor lonely, simple folks grew to care for the homeless, motherless thing,
     and they and the people about all called it Bébée — only Bébée.</p>
    <p>The church got at it and added to it a saint's name; but for all its little world it remained
     Bébée — Bébée when it trotted no higher than the red carnation heads; — Bébée when its yellow curls
     touched as high as the lavender-bush; — Bébée on this proud day when the thrush's song and the
     cock's crow found her sixteen years old.</p>
    <p>Old Antoine's hut stood in a little patch of garden ground with a brier hedge all round it,
     in that byway which lies between Laeken and Brussels, in the heart of flat, green Brabant,
     where there are beautiful meadows and tall, flowering hedges, and forest trees, and fern-filled
     ditches, and a little piece of water, deep and cool, where the swans sail all day long, and the
     silvery willows dip and sway with the wind.</p>
    <p>Turn aside from the highway, and there it lies to-day, and all the place brims over with
     grass, and boughs, and blossoms, and flowering beans, and wild dog-roses; and there are a few
     cottages and cabins there near the pretty water, and farther there is an old church, sacred to
     St. Guido; and beyond go the green level country and the endless wheat-fields, and the old
     mills with their red sails against the sun; and beyond all these the pale blue, sea-like
     horizon of the plains of Flanders.</p>
    <p>It was a pretty little hut, pink all over like a sea-shell, in the fashion that the
     Netherlanders love; and its two little square lattices were dark with creeping plants and big
     rose-bushes, and its roof, so low that you could touch it, was golden and green with all the
     lichens and stoneworts that are known on earth.</p>
    <p>Here Bébée grew from year to year; and soon learned to be big enough and hardy enough to tie
     up bunches of stocks and pinks for the market, and then to carry a basket for herself, trotting
     by Antoine's side along the green roadway and into the white, wide streets; and in the market
     the buyers — most often of all when they were young mothers — would seek out the little golden head
     and the beautiful frank blue eyes, and buy Bébée's lilies and carnations whether they wanted
     them or not. So that old Mäes used to cross himself and say that, thanks to Our Lady, trade was
     thrice as stirring since the little one had stretched out her rosy fingers with the
     flowers.</p>
    <p>All the same, however stirring trade might be in summer, when the long winters came and the
     Montagne de la Cour was a sharp slope of ice, and the pinnacles of St. Gudule were all frosted
     white with snow, and the hot-house flowers alone could fill the market, and the country gardens
     were bitter black wind-swept desolations where the chilly roots huddled themselves together
     underground like homeless children in a cellar, — then the money gained in the time of leaf and
     blossom was all needed to buy a black loaf and fagot of wood; and many a day in the little pink
     hut Bébée rolled herself up in her bed like a dormouse, to forget in sleep that she was
     supperless and as cold as a frozen robin.</p>
    <p>So that when Antoine Mäes grew sick and died, more from age and weakness than any real
     disease, there were only a few silver crowns in the brown jug hidden in the thatch; and the hut
     itself, with its patch of ground, was all that he could leave to Bébée.</p>
    <p>"Live in it, little one, and take nobody in it to worry you, and be good to the bird and the
     goat, and be sure to keep the flowers blowing," said the old man with his last breath; and
     sobbing her heart out by his bedside, Bébée vowed to do his bidding.</p>
    <p>She was not quite fourteen then, and when she had laid her old friend to rest in the rough
     green graveyard about St. Guido, she was very sorrowful and lonely, poor little, bright Bébée,
     who had never hardly known a worse woe than to run the thorns of the roses into her fingers, or
     to cry because a thrush was found starved to death in the snow.</p>
    <p>Bébée went home, and sat down in a corner and thought.</p>
    <p>The hut was her own, and her own the little green triangle just then crowded with its Mayday
     blossom in all the colors of the rainbow. She was to live in it, and never let the flowers die,
     so he had said; good, rough old ugly Antoine Mäes, who had been to her as father, mother,
     country, king, and law.</p>
    <p>The sun was shining.</p>
    <p>Through the little square of the lattice she could see the great tulips opening in the grass
     and a bough of the apple-tree swaying in the wind. A chaffinch clung to the bough, and swung to
     and fro singing. The door stood open, with the broad, bright day beaming through; and Bébée's
     little world came streaming in with it, — the world which dwelt in the half-dozen cottages that
     fringed this green lane of hers like beavers' nests pushed out under the leaves on to the
     water's edge.</p>
    <p>They came in, six or eight of them, all women; trim, clean, plain Brabant peasants,
     hard-working, kindly of nature, and shrewd in their own simple matters; people who labored in
     the fields all the day long, or worked themselves blind over the lace pillows in the city.</p>
    <p>"You are too young to live alone, Bébée," said the first of them. "My old mother shall come
     and keep house for you."</p>
    <p>"Nay, better come and live with me, Bébée," said the second. "I will give you bit and drop,
     and clothing, too, for the right to your plot of ground."</p>
    <p>"That is to cheat her," said the third. "Hark, here, Bébée: my sister, who is a lone woman,
     as you know well, shall come and bide with you, and ask you nothing — nothing at all — only you
     shall just give her a crust, perhaps, and a few flowers to sell sometimes."</p>
    <p>"No, no," said the fourth; "that will not do. You let me have the garden and the hut, Bébée,
     and my sons shall till the place for you; and I will live with you myself, and leave the boys
     the cabin, so you will have all the gain, do you not see, dear little one?"</p>
    <p>"Pooh!" said the fifth, stouter and better clothed than the rest. "You are all eager for your
     own good, not for hers. Now I — Father Francis says we should all do as we would be done by — I
     will take Bébée to live with me, all for nothing; and we will root the flowers up and plant it
     with good cabbages and potatoes and salad plants. And I will stable my cows in the hut to
     sweeten it after a dead man, and I will take my chance of making money out of it, and no one
     can speak more fair than that when one sees what weather is, and thinks what insects do; and
     all the year round, winter and summer, Bébée here will want for nothing, and have to take no
     care for herself whatever."</p>
    <p>She who spoke, Mère Krebs, was the best-to-do woman in the little lane, having two cows of
     her own and ear-rings of solid silver, and a green cart, and a big dog that took the milk into
     Brussels. She was heard, therefore, with respect, and a short silence followed her words.</p>
    <p>But it was very short; and a hubbub of voices crossed each other after it as the speakers
     grew hotter against one another and more eager to convince each other of the disinterestedness
     and delicacy of their offers of aid.</p>
    <p>Through it all Bébée sat quite quiet on the edge of the little truckle-bed, with her eyes
     fixed on the apple bough and the singing chaffinch.</p>
    <p>She heard them all patiently.</p>
    <p>They were all her good friends, friends old and true. This one had given her cherries for
     many a summer. That other had bought her a little waxen Jesus at the Kermesse. The old woman in
     the blue linen skirt had taken her to her first communion. She who wanted her sister to have
     the crust and the flowers, had brought her a beautiful painted book of hours that had cost a
     whole franc. Another had given her the solitary wonder, travel, and foreign feast of her whole
     life, — a day fifteen miles away at the fair at Mechlin. The last speaker of all had danced her
     on her knee a hundred times in babyhood, and told her legends, and let her ride in the green
     cart behind big curly-coated Tambour.</p>
    <p>Bébée did not doubt that these trusty old friends meant well by her, and yet a certain heavy
     sense fell on her that in all these counsels there was not the same whole-hearted and frank
     goodness that had prompted the gifts to her of the waxen Jesus, and the Kermesse of
     Mechlin.</p>
    <p>Bébée did not reason, because she was too little a thing and too trustful; but she felt, in a
     vague, sorrowful fashion, that they were all of them trying to make some benefit out of her
     poor little heritage, with small regard for herself at the root of their speculations.</p>
    <p>Bébée was a child, wholly a child; body and soul were both as fresh in her as a golden crocus
     just born out of the snows. But she was not a little fool, though people sometimes called her
     so because she would sit in the moments of her leisure with her blue eyes on the far-away
     clouds like a thing in a dream.</p>
    <p>She heard them patiently till the cackle of shrill voices had exhausted itself, and the six
     women stood on the sunny mud floor of the hut eyeing each other with venomous glances; for
     though they were good neighbors at all times, each, in this matter, was hungry for the
     advantages to be got out of old Antoine's plot of ground. They were very poor; they toiled in
     the scorched or frozen fields all weathers, or spent from dawn to nightfall poring over their
     cobweb lace; and to save a son or gain a cabbage was of moment to them only second to the
     keeping of their souls secure of heaven by Lenten mass and Easter psalm.</p>
    <p>Bébée listened to them all, and the tears dried on her cheeks, and her pretty rosebud lips
     curled close in one another.</p>
    <p>"You are very good, no doubt, all of you," she said at last. "But I cannot tell you that I am
     thankful, for my heart is like a stone, and I think it is not so very much for me as it is for
     the hut that you are speaking. Perhaps it is wrong in me to say so; yes, I am wrong, I am
     sure, — you are all kind, and I am only Bébée. But you see he told me to live here and take care
     of the flowers, and I must do it, that is certain. I will ask Father Francis, if you wish: but
     if he tells me I am wrong, as you do. I shall stay here all the same."</p>
    <p>And in answer to their expostulations and condemnation, she only said the same thing over
     again always, in different words, but to the same steadfast purpose. The women clamored about
     her for an hour in reproach and rebuke; she was a baby indeed, she was a little fool, she was a
     naughty, obstinate child, she was an ungrateful, wilful little creature, who ought to be beaten
     till she was blue, if only there was anybody that had the right to do it!</p>
    <p>"But there is nobody that has the right," said Bébée, getting angry and standing upright on
     the floor, with Antoine's old gray cat in her round arms. "He told me to stay here, and he
     would not have said so if it had been wrong; and I am old enough to do for myself, and I am not
     afraid, and who is there that would hurt me? Oh, yes; go and tell Father Francis, if you like!
     I do not believe he will blame me, but if he do, I must bear it. Even if he shut the church
     door on me, I will obey Antoine, and the flowers will know I am right, and they will let no
     evil spirits touch me, for the flowers are strong for that; they talk to the angels in the
     night."</p>
    <p>What use was it to argue with a little idiot like this? Indeed, peasants never do argue; they
     use abuse.</p>
    <p>It is their only form of logic.</p>
    <p>They used it to Bébée, rating her soundly, as became people who were old enough to be her
     grandmothers, and who knew that she had been raked out of their own pond, and had no more real
     place in creation than a water rat, as one might say.</p>
    <p>The women were kindly, and had never thrown this truth against her before, and in fact, to be
     a foundling was no sort of disgrace to their sight; but anger is like wine, and makes the
     depths of the mind shine clear, and all the mud that is in the depths stink in the light; and
     in their wrath at not sharing Antoine's legacy, the good souls said bitter things that in calm
     moments they would no more have uttered than they would have taken up a knife to slit her
     throat.</p>
    <p>They talked themselves hoarse with impatience and chagrin, and went backwards over the
     threshold, their wooden shoes and their shrill voices keeping a clattering chorus. By this time
     it was evening; the sun had gone off the floor, and the bird had done singing.</p>
    <p>Bébée stood in the same place, hardening her little heart, whilst big and bitter tears
     swelled into her eyes, and fell on the soft fur of the sleeping cat.</p>
    <p>She only very vaguely understood why it was in any sense shameful to have been raked out of
     the water-lilies like a drowning field mouse, as they had said it was.</p>
    <p>She and Antoine had often talked of that summer morning when he had found her there among the
     leaves, and Bébée and he had laughed over it gayly, and she had been quite proud in her
     innocent fashion that she had had a fairy and the flowers for her mother and godmothers, which
     Antoine always told her was the case beyond any manner of doubt. Even Father Francis, hearing
     the pretty harmless fiction, had never deemed it his duty to disturb her pleasure in it, being
     a good, cheerful old man, who thought that woe and wisdom both come soon enough to bow young
     shoulders and to silver young curls without his interference.</p>
    <p>Bébée had always thought it quite a fine thing to have been born of water-lilies, with the
     sun for her father, and when people in Brussels had asked her of her parentage, seeing her
     stand in the market with a certain look on her that was not like other children, had always
     gravely answered in the purest good faith, — </p>
    <p>"My mother was a flower."</p>
    <p>"You are a flower, at any rate," they would say in return; and Bébée had been always quite
     content.</p>
    <p>But now she was doubtful; she was rather perplexed than sorrowful.</p>
    <p>These good friends of hers seemed to see some new sin about her. Perhaps, after all, thought
     Bébée, it might have been better to have had a human mother who would have taken care of her
     now that old Antoine was dead, instead of those beautiful, gleaming, cold water-lilies which
     went to sleep on their green velvet beds, and did not certainly care when the thorns ran into
     her fingers, or the pebbles got in her wooden shoes.</p>
    <p>In some vague way, disgrace and envy — the twin Discords of the world — touched her innocent
     cheek with their hot breath, and as the evening fell, Bébée felt very lonely and a little
     wistful.</p>
    <p>She had been always used to run out in the pleasant twilight-time among the flowers and water
     them, Antoine filling the can from the well; and the neighbors would come and lean against the
     little low wall, knitting and gossiping; and the big dogs, released from harness, would poke
     their heads through the wicket for a crust; and the children would dance and play Colin
     Maillard on the green by the water; and she, when the flowers were no longer thirsted, would
     join them, and romp and dance and sing the gayest of them all.</p>
    <p>But now the buckets hung at the bottom of the well, and the flowers hungered in vain, and the
     neighbors held aloof, and she shut to the hut door and listened to the rain which began to
     fall, and cried herself to sleep all alone in her tiny kingdom.</p>
    <p>When the dawn came the sun rose red and warm; the grass and boughs sparkled; a lark sang;
     Bébée awoke sad in heart, indeed, for her lost old friend, but brighter and braver.</p>
    <p>"Each of them wants to get something out of me," thought the child. "Well, I will live alone,
     then, and do my duty, just as he said. The flowers will never let any real harm come, though
     they do look so indifferent and smiling sometimes, and though not one of them hung their heads
     when his coffin was carried through them yesterday."</p>
    <p>That want of sympathy in the flower troubled her.</p>
    <p>The old man had loved them so well; and they had all looked as glad as ever, and had laughed
     saucily in the sun, and not even a rosebud turned the paler as the poor still stiffened limbs
     went by in the wooden shell.</p>
    <p>"I suppose God cares; but I wish they did." said Bébée, to whom the garden was more
     intelligible than Providence.</p>
    <p>"Why do you not care?" she asked the pinks, shaking the raindrops off their curled rosy
     petals.</p>
    <p>The pinks leaned lazily against their sticks, and seemed to say, "Why should we care for
     anything, unless a slug be eating us? — <emph>that</emph> is real woe, if you like."</p>
    <p>Bébée, without her sabots on, wandered thoughtfully among the sweet wet sunlightened
     labyrinths of blossom, her pretty bare feet treading the narrow grassy paths with pleasure in
     their coolness.</p>
    <p>"He was so good to you!" she said reproachfully to the great gaudy gillyflowers and the
     painted sweet-peas. "He never let you know heat or cold, he never let the worm gnaw or the
     snail harm you; he would get up in the dark to see after your wants; and when the ice froze
     over you, he was there to loosen your chains. Why do you not care, anyone of you?"</p>
    <p>"How silly you are!" said the flowers. "You must be a butterfly or a poet, Bébée, to be as
     foolish as that. Some one will do all he did. We are of market value, you know. Care, indeed!
     when the sun is so warm, and there is not an earwig in the place to trouble us."</p>
    <p>The flowers were not always so selfish as this; and perhaps the sorrow in Bébée's heart made
     their callousness seem harder than it really was.</p>
    <p>When we suffer very much ourselves, anything that smiles in the sun seems cruel — a child, a
     bird, a dragon-fly — nay, even a fluttering ribbon, or a spear-grass that waves in the wind.</p>
    <p>There was a little shrine at the corner of the garden, set into the wall; a niche with a bit
     of glass and a picture of the Virgin, so battered that no one could trace any feature of
     it.</p>
    <p>It had been there for centuries, and was held in great veneration; and old Antoine had always
     cut the choicest buds of his roses and set them in a delf pot in front of it, every other
     morning all the summer long. Bébée, whose religion was the sweetest, vaguest mingling of Pagan
     and Christian myths, and whose faith in fairies and in saints was exactly equal in strength and
     in ignorance, — Bébée filled the delf pot anew carefully, then knelt down on the turf in that
     little green corner, and prayed in devout hopeful childish good faith to the awful unknown
     Powers who were to her only as gentle guides and kindly playmates.</p>
    <p>Was she too familiar with the Holy Mother?</p>
    <p>She was almost fearful that she was; but then the Holy Mother loved flowers so well, Bébée
     would not feel aloof from her, nor be afraid.</p>
    <p>"When one cuts the best blossoms for her, and tries to be good, and never tells a lie,"
     thought Bébée, "I am quite sure, as she loves the lilies, that she will never altogether forget
     me."</p>
    <p>So she said to the Mother of Christ fearlessly, and nothing doubting; and then rose for her
     daily work of cutting the flowers for the market in Brussels.</p>
    <p>By the time her baskets were full, her fowls fed, her goat foddered, her starling's cage
     cleaned, her hut door locked, and her wooden shoes clattering on the sunny road into the city,
     Bébée was almost content again, though ever and again, as she trod the familiar ways, the tears
     dimmed her eyes as she remembered that old Antoine would never again hobble over the stones
     beside her.</p>
    <p>"You are a little wilful one, and too young to live alone," said Father Francis, meeting her
     in the lane.</p>
    <p>But he did not scold her seriously, and she kept to her resolve; and the women, who were good
     at heart, took her back into favor again; and so Bébée had her own way, and the fairies, or the
     saints, or both together, took care of her; and so it came to pass that all alone she heard the
     cock crow whilst it was dark, and woke to the grand and amazing truth that this warm, fragrant,
     dusky June morning found her full sixteen years old.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
    <p>The two years had not been all playtime any more than they had been all summer.</p>
    <p>When one has not father, or mother, or brother, and all one's friends have barely bread
     enough for themselves, life cannot be very easy, nor its crusts very many at any time.</p>
    <p>Bébée had a cherub's mouth, and a dreamer's eyes, and a poet's thoughts sometimes in her own
     untaught and unconscious fashion.</p>
    <p>But all the same she was a little hard-working Brabant peasant girl; up whilst the birds
     twittered in the dark; to bed when the red sun sank beyond the far blue line of the plains; she
     hoed, and dug, and watered, and planted her little plot; she kept her cabin as clean as a
     fresh-blossomed primrose; she milked her goat and swept her floor; she sat, all the warm days,
     in the town, selling her flowers, and in the winter time, when her garden yielded her nothing,
     she strained her sight over lace-making in the city to get the small bit of food that stood
     between her and that hunger which to the poor means death.</p>
    <p>A hard life; very hard when hail and snow made the streets of Brussels like slopes of ice; a
     little hard even in the gay summer time when she sat under the awning fronting the Maison du
     Roi; but all the time the child throve on it, and was happy, and dreamed of many graceful and
     gracious things whilst she was weeding among her lilies, or tracing the threads to and fro on
     her lace pillow.</p>
    <p>Now — when she woke to the full sense of her wonderful sixteen years — Bébée, standing barefoot
     on the mud floor, was as pretty a sight as was to be seen betwixt Scheldt and Rhine.</p>
    <p>The sun had only left a soft warmth like an apricot's on her white skin. Her limbs, though
     strong as a mountain pony's, were slender and well shaped. Her hair curled in shiny crumpled
     masses, and tumbled about her shoulders. Her pretty round plump little breast was white as the
     lilies in the grass without, and in this blooming time of her little life, Bébée, in her way,
     was beautiful as a peach-bloom is beautiful, and her innocent, courageous, happy eyes had
     dreams in them underneath their laughter, dreams that went farther than the green woods of
     Laeken, farther even than the white clouds of summer.</p>
    <p>She could not move among them idly as poets and girls love to do; she had to be active amidst
     them, else drought and rain, and worm and snail, and blight and frost, would have made havoc of
     their fairest hopes.</p>
    <p>The loveliest love is that which dreams high above all storms, unsoiled by all burdens; but
     perhaps the strongest love is that which, whilst it adores, drags its feet through mire, and
     burns its brow in heat, for the thing beloved.</p>
    <p>So Bébée dreamed in her garden; but all the time for sake of it hoed and dug, and hurt her
     hands, and tired her limbs, and bowed her shoulders under the great metal pails from the
     well.</p>
    <p>This wondrous morning, with the bright burden of her sixteen years upon her, she dressed
     herself quickly and fed her fowls, and, happy as a bird, went to sit on her little wooden stool
     in the doorway.</p>
    <p>There had been fresh rain in the night: the garden was radiant; the smell of the wet earth
     was sweeter than all perfumes that are burned in palaces.</p>
    <p>The dripping rosebuds nodded against her hair as she went out; the starling called to her,
     "Bébée, Bébée — bonjour, bonjour." These were all the words it knew. It said the same words a
     thousand times a week. But to Bébée it seemed that the starling most certainly knew that she
     was sixteen years old that day.</p>
    <p>Breaking her bread into the milk, she sat in the dawn and thought, without knowing that she
     thought it, "How good it is to live when one is young!"</p>
    <p>Old people say the same thing often, but they sigh when they say it. Bébée smiled.</p>
    <p>Mère Krebs opened her door in the next cottage, and nodded over the wall.</p>
    <p>"What a fine thing to be sixteen! — a merry year, Bébée."</p>
    <p>Marthe, the carpenter's wife, came out from her gate, broom in hand.</p>
    <p>"The Holy Saints keep you, Bébée; why, you are quite a woman now!"</p>
    <p>The little children of Varnhart, the charcoal-burner, who were as poor as any mouse in the
     old churches, rushed out of their little home up the lane, bringing with them a cake stuck full
     of sugar and seeds, and tied round with a blue ribbon, that their mother had made that very
     week, all in her honor.</p>
    <p>"Only see, Bébée! Such a grand cake!" they shouted, dancing down the lane. "Jules picked the
     plums, and Jeanne washed the almonds, and Christine took the ribbon off her own communion cap,
     all for you — all for you; but you will let us come and eat it too?"</p>
    <p>Old Gran'mère Bishot, who was the oldest woman about Laeken, hobbled through the grass on her
     crutches and nodded her white shaking head, and smiled at Bébée.</p>
    <p>"I have nothing to give you, little one, except my blessing, if you care for that."</p>
    <p>Bébée ran out, breaking from the children, and knelt down in the wet grass, and bent her
     pretty sunny head to the benediction.</p>
    <p>Trine, the miller's wife, the richest woman of them all, called to the child from the steps
     of the mill, — '</p>
    <p>"A merry year, and the blessing of Heaven, Bébée! Come up, and here is my first dish of
     cherries for you; not tasted one myself; they will make you a feast with Varnhart's cake,
     though she should have known better, so poor as she is. Charity begins at home, and these
     children's stomachs are empty."</p>
    <p>Bébée ran up and then down again gleefully, with her lapful of big black cherries; Tambour,
     the old white dog, who had used to drag her about in his milk cart, leaping on her in sympathy
     and congratulation.</p>
    <p>"What a supper we will have!" she cried to the charcoal-burner's children, who were turning
     somersaults in the dock leaves, while the swans stared and hissed.</p>
    <p>When one is sixteen, cherries and a cake have a flavor of Paradise still, especially when
     they are tasted twice, or thrice at most, in all the year.</p>
    <p>An old man called to her as she went by his door. All these little cabins lie close together,
     with only their apple-trees, or their tall beans, or their hedges of thorn between them; you
     may ride by and never notice them if you do not look for them under the leaves closely, as you
     would for thrushes' nests.</p>
    <p>He, too, was very old; a lifelong neighbor and gossip of Antoine's; he had been a day laborer
     in these same fields all his years, and had never travelled farther than where the red
     mill-sails turned among the colza and the corn.</p>
    <p>"Come in, my pretty one, for a second," he whispered, with an air of mystery that made
     Bébée's heart quicken with expectancy. "Come in; I have something for you. They were my dead
     daughter's — you have heard me talk of her — Lisette, who died forty year or more ago, they say;
     for me I think it was yesterday. Mère Krebs — she is a hard woman — heard me talking of my girl.
     She burst out laughing, 'Lord's sake, fool, why, your girl would be sixty now an she had
     lived.' Well, so it may be; you see, the new mill was put up the week she died, and you call
     the new mill old; but, my girl, she is young to me. Always young. Come here, Bébée."</p>
    <p>Bébée went after him a little awed, into the dusky interior, that smelt of stored apples and
     of dried herbs that hung from the roof. There was a walnut-wood press, such as the peasants of
     France and the low countries keep their homespun linen in and their old lace that serves for
     the nuptials and baptisms of half a score of generations.</p>
    <p>The old man unlocked it with a trembling hand, and there came from it an odor of dead
     lavender and of withered rose leaves.</p>
    <p>On the shelves there were a girl's set of clothes, and a girl's sabots, and a girl's
     communion veil and wreath.</p>
    <p>"They are all hers," he whispered, — "all hers. And sometimes in the evening time I see her
     coming along the lane for them — do you not know? There is nothing changed; nothing changed; the
     grass, and the trees, and the huts, and the pond are all here; why should she only be gone
     away?"</p>
    <p>"Antoine is gone."</p>
    <p>"Yes. But he was old; my girl is young."</p>
    <p>He stood a moment, with the press door open, a perplexed trouble in his dim eyes; the divine
     faith of love and the mule-like stupidity of ignorance made him cling to this one thought
     without power of judgment in it.</p>
    <p>"They say she would be sixty," he said, with a little dreary smile. "But that is absurd, you
     know. Why, she had cheeks like yours, and she would run — no lapwing could fly faster over corn.
     These are her things, you see; yes — all of them. That is the sprig of sweetbrier she wore in her
     belt the day before the wagon knocked her down and killed her. I have never touched the things.
     But look here, Bébée, you are a good child and true, and like her just a little. I mean to give
     you her silver clasps. They were her great-great-great-grandmother's before her. God knows how
     old they are not. And a girl should have some little wealth of that sort; and for Antoine's
     sake — "</p>
    <p>The old man stayed behind, closing the press door upon the lavender-scented clothes, and
     sitting down in the dull shadow of the hut to think of his daughter, dead forty summers and
     more.</p>
    <p>Bébée went out with the brave broad silver clasps about her waist, and the tears wet on her
     cheeks for a grief not her own.</p>
    <p>To be killed just when one was young, and was loved liked that, and all the world was in its
     May-day flower! The silver felt cold to her touch — as cold as though it were the dead girl's
     hands that held her.</p>
    <p>The garlands that the children strung of daisies and hung about her had never chilled her
     so.</p>
    <p>But little Jeanne, the youngest of the charcoal-burner's little tribe, running to meet her,
     screamed with glee, and danced in the gay morning.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Bébée! how you glitter! Did the Virgin send you that off her own altar? Let me see — let
     me touch! Is it made of the stars or of the sun?"</p>
    <p>And Bébée danced with the child, and the silver gleamed and sparkled, and all the people came
     running out to see, and the milk carts were half an hour later for town, and the hens cackled
     loud unfed, and the men even stopped on their way to the fields and paused, with their scythes
     on their shoulders, to stare at the splendid gift.</p>
    <p>"There is not such another set of clasps in Brabant; old work you could make a fortune of in
     the curiosity shops in the Montagne," said Trine Krebs, going up the steps of her mill house.
     "But, all the same, you know, Bébée, things off a dead body bring mischance sometimes."</p>
    <p>But Bébée danced with the child, and did not hear.</p>
    <p>Whose fête day had ever begun like this one of hers?</p>
    <p>She was a little poet at heart, and should not have cared for such vanities; but when one is
     only sixteen, and has only a little rough woollen frock, and sits in the market place or the
     lace-room, with other girls around, how should one be altogether indifferent to a broad,
     embossed, beautiful shield of silver that sparkled with each step one took?</p>
    <p>A quarter of an hour idle thus was all, however, that Bébée or her friends could spare at
     five o'clock on a summer morning, when the city was waiting for its eggs, its honey, its
     flowers, its cream, and its butter, and Tambour was shaking his leather harness in impatience
     to be off with his milk-cans.</p>
    <p>So Bébée, all holiday though it was, and heroine though she felt herself, ran indoors, put up
     her cakes and cherries, cut her two basketfuls out of the garden, locked her hut, and went on
     her quick and happy little feet along the grassy paths toward the city.</p>
    <p>The sorting and tying up of the flowers she always left until she was sitting under the
     awning in front of the Broodhuis; the same awning, tawny as an autumn pear and weather-blown as
     an old sail, which had served to shelter Antoine Mäes from heat and rain through all the years
     of his life.</p>
    <p>"Go to the Madeleine; you will make money there, with your pretty blue eyes, Bébée," people
     had said to her of late; but Bébée had shaken her head.</p>
    <p>Where she had sat in her babyhood at Antoine's feet, she would sit so long as she sold
     flowers in Brussels, — here, underneath the shadow of the Gothic towers that saw Egmont die.</p>
    <p>Old Antoine had never gone into the grand market that is fashioned after the Madeleine of
     Paris, and where in the cool, wet, sweet-smelling halls, all the flowers of Brabant are spread
     in bouquets fit for the bridal of Una, and large as the shield of the Red-Cross Knight.</p>
    <p>Antoine could not compete with all those treasures of greenhouse and stove. He had always had
     his little stall among those which spread their tawny awnings and their merry hardy blossoms
     under the shadow of the Hôtel de Ville, in the midst of the buyings and sellings, the games and
     the quarrels, the auctions and the Cheap Johns, the mountebank and the marriage parties, that
     daily and hourly throng the Grande Place.</p>
    <p>Here Bébée, from three years old, had been used to sit beside him. By nature she was as gay
     as a lark. The people always heard her singing as they passed the garden. The children never
     found their games so merry as when she danced their rounds with them; and though she dreamed so
     much out there in the air among the carnations and the roses, or in the long, low workroom in
     the town, high against the crocketed pinnacles of the cathedral, yet her dreams, if vaguely
     wistful, were all bright of hue and sunny in their fantasies. Still, Bébée had one sad
     unsatisfied desire: she wanted to know so much, and she knew nothing.</p>
    <p>She did not care for the grand gay people.</p>
    <p>When the band played, and the park filled, and the bright little cafés were thronged with
     pleasure seekers, and the crowds flocked hither and thither to the woods, to the theatres, to
     the galleries, to the guinguettes, Bébée, going gravely along with her emptied baskets
     homeward, envied none of these.</p>
    <p>When at Noël the little children hugged their loads of puppets and sugar-plums; when at the
     Fête Dieu the whole people flocked out be-ribboned and vari-colored like any bed of spring
     anemones; when in the merry midsummer the chars-a-bancs trundled away into the forest with
     laughing loads of students and maidens; when in the rough winters the carriages left furred and
     jewelled women at the doors of the operas or the palaces, — Bébée, going and coming through the
     city to her flower stall or lace work, looked at them all, and never thought of envy or
     desire.</p>
    <p>She had her little hut: she could get her bread; she lived with the flowers; the neighbors
     were good to her, and now and then, on a saint's day, she too got her day in the woods; it
     never occurred to her that her lot could be better.</p>
    <p>But sometimes sitting, looking at the dark old beauty of the Broodhuis, or at the wondrous
     carven fronts of other Spanish houses, or at the painted stories of the cathedral windows, or
     at the quaint colors of the shipping on the quay, or at the long dark aisles of trees that went
     away through the forest, where her steps had never wandered, — sometimes Bébée would get
     pondering on all this unknown world that lay before and behind and around her, and a sense of
     her own utter ignorance would steal on her; and she would say to herself, "If only I knew a
     little — just a very little!"</p>
    <p>But it is not easy to know even a very little when you have to work for your bread from
     sunrise to nightfall, and when none of your friends know how to read or write, and even your
     old priest is one of a family of peasants, and can just teach you the alphabet, and that is
     all. For Father Francis could do no more than this; and all his spare time was taken up in
     digging his cabbage plot and seeing to his beehives; and the only books that Bébée ever beheld
     were a few tattered lives of saints that lay moth-eaten on a shelf of his cottage.</p>
    <p>But Brussels has stones that are sermons, or rather that are quaint, touching, illuminated
     legends of the Middle Ages, which those who run may read.</p>
    <p>Brussels is a gay little city that lies as bright within its girdle of woodland as any
     butterfly that rests upon moss.</p>
    <p>The city has its ways and wiles of Paris. It decks itself with white and gold. It has music
     under its trees and soldiers in its streets, and troops marching and countermarching along its
     sunny avenues. It has blue and pink, and yellow and green, on its awnings and on its house
     fronts. It has a merry open-air life on its pavements at little marble tables before little
     gay-colored cafés. It has gilded balconies, and tossing flags, and comic operas, and leisurely
     pleasure seekers, and tries always to believe and make the world believe that it is Paris in
     very truth.</p>
    <p>But this is only the Brussels of the noblesse and the foreigners.</p>
    <p>There is a Brussels that is better than this — a Brussels that belongs to the old burgher life,
     to the artists and the craftsmen, to the master-masons of the Moyen-âge, to the same spirit and
     soul that once filled the free men of Ghent and the citizens of Bruges and the besieged of
     Leyden, and the blood of Egmont and of Horn.</p>
    <p>Down there by the water-side, where the old quaint walls lean over the yellow sluggish
     stream, and the green barrels of the Antwerp barges swing against the dusky piles of the
     crumbling bridges.</p>
    <p>In the gray square desolate courts of the old palaces, where in cobwebbed galleries and
     silent chambers the Flemish tapestries drop to pieces.</p>
    <p>In the great populous square, where, above the clamorous and rushing crowds, the majestic
     front of the Maison du Roi frowns against the sun, and the spires and pinnacles of the
     burgomaster's gathering-halls tower into the sky in all the fantastic luxuriance of Gothic
     fancy.</p>
    <p>Under the vast shadowy wings of angels in the stillness of the cathedral, across whose sunny
     aisles some little child goes slowly all alone, laden with lilies for the Feast of the
     Assumption, till their white glory hides its curly head.</p>
    <p>In all strange quaint old-world niches withdrawn from men in silent grass-grown corners,
     where a twelfth-century corbel holds a pot of roses, or a Gothic arch yawns beneath a wool
     warehouse, or a waterspout with a grinning faun's head laughs in the grim humor of the
     Moyen-âge above the bent head of a young lace-worker.</p>
    <p>In all these, Brussels, though more worldly than her sisters of Ghent and Bruges, and far
     more worldly yet than her Teuton cousins of Freiburg and Nürnberg, is still in her own way like
     as a monkish story mixed up with the Romaunt of the Rose; or rather like some gay French
     vaudeville, all fashion and jest, illustrated in old Missal manner with helm and hauberk, cope
     and cowl, praying knights and fighting priests, winged griffins and nimbused saints,
     flame-breathing dragons and enamoured princes, all mingled together in the illuminated colors
     and the heroical grotesque romance of the Middle Ages.</p>
    <p>And it was this side of the city that Bébée knew; and she loved it well, and would not leave
     it for the market of the Madeleine.</p>
    <p>She had no one to tell her anything, and all Antoine had ever been able to say to her
     concerning the Broodhuis was that it had been there in his father's time; and regarding St.
     Gudule, that his mother had burned many a candle before its altars for a dead brother who had
     been drowned off the dunes.</p>
    <p>But the child's mind, unled, but not misled, had pondered on these things, and her heart had
     grown to love them; and perhaps no student of Spanish architecture, no antiquary of Moyen-âge
     relics, loved St. Gudule and the Broodhuis as little ignorant Bébée did.</p>
    <p>There had been a time when great dark, fierce men had builded these things, and made the
     place beautiful. So much she knew; and the little wistful, untaught brain tried to project
     itself into those unknown times, and failed, and yet found pleasure in the effort. And Bébée
     would say to herself as she walked the streets, "Perhaps some one will come some day who will
     tell me all those things."</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, there were the flowers, and she was quite content.</p>
    <p>Besides, she knew all the people: the old cobbler, who sat next her, and chattered all day
     long like a magpie; the tinker, who had come up many a summer night to drink a-glass with
     Antoine; the Cheap John, who cheated everybody else, but who had always given her a toy or a
     trinket at every Fête Dieu all the summers she had known; the little old woman, sour as a crab,
     who sold rosaries and pictures of saints, and little waxen Christs upon a tray; the big dogs
     who pulled the carts in, and lay panting all day under the rush-bottomed chairs on which the
     egg-wives and the fruit sellers sat, and knitted, and chaffered; nay, even the gorgeous
     huissier and the frowning gendarme, who marshalled the folks into order as they went up for
     municipal registries, or for town misdemeanors, — she knew them all; had known them all ever
     since she had first trotted in like a little dog at Antoine's heels.</p>
    <p>So Bébée stayed there.</p>
    <p>It is, perhaps, the most beautiful square in all Northern Europe, with its black timbers, and
     gilded carvings, and blazoned windows, and majestic scutcheons, and fantastic pinnacles. That
     Bébée did not know, but she loved it, and she sat resolutely in front of the Broodhuis, selling
     her flowers, smiling, chatting, helping the old woman, counting her little gains, eating her
     bit of bread at noonday like any other market girl, but at times glancing up to the stately
     towers and the blue sky, with a look on her face that made the old tinker and cobbler whisper
     together, "What does she see there? — the dead people or the angels?"</p>
    <p>The truth was that even Bébée herself did not know very surely what she saw — something that
     was still nearer to her than even this kindly crowd that loved her. That was all she could have
     said had anybody asked her.</p>
    <p>But none did.</p>
    <p>No one wanted to hear what the dead said; and for the angels, the tinker and the cobbler were
     of opinion that one had only too much of them sculptured about everywhere, and shining on all
     the casements — in reverence be it spoken, of course.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
    <p>"I remembered it was your name-day, child Here are half a dozen eggs," said one of the hen
     wives; and the little cross woman with the pedler's tray added a waxen St. Agnes, colored red
     and yellow to the very life no doubt; and the old Cheap John had saved her a cage for the
     starling; and the tinker had a cream cheese for her in a vine-leaf, and the sweetmeat seller
     brought her a beautiful gilded horn of sugarplums, and the cobbler had made her actually a pair
     of shoes — red shoes, beautiful shoes to go to mass in and be a wonder in to all the
     neighborhood. And they thronged round her, and adored the silver waist buckles; and when Bébée
     got fairly to her stall, and traffic began, she thought once more that nobody's feast day had
     ever dawned like hers.</p>
    <p>When the chimes began to ring all over the city, she could hardly believe that the carillon
     was not saying its "Laus Deo" with some special meaning in its bells of her.</p>
    <p>The morning went by as usual; the noise of the throngs about her like a driving of angry
     winds, but no more hurting her than the angels on the roof of St. Gudule are hurt by the storm
     when it breaks.</p>
    <p>Hard words, fierce passions, low thoughts, evil deeds, passed by the child without resting on
     her; her heart was in her flowers, and was like one of them with the dew of daybreak on it.</p>
    <p>There were many strangers in the city, and such are always sure to loiter in the Spanish
     square; and she sold fast and well her lilacs and her roses, and her knots of thyme and
     sweetbrier.</p>
    <p>She was always a little sorry to see them go, her kindly pretty playmates that, nine times
     out of ten no doubt, only drooped and died in the hands that purchased them, as human souls
     soil and shrivel in the grasp of the passions that woo them.</p>
    <p>The day was a busy one, and brought in good profit. Bébée had no less than fifty sous in her
     leather pouch when it was over, — a sum of magnitude in the green lane by Laeken.</p>
    <p>A few of her moss-roses were still unsold, that was all, when the Ave Maria began ringing
     over the town and the people dispersed to their homes or their pleasuring.</p>
    <p>It was a warm gray evening: the streets were full; there were blossoms in all the balconies,
     and gay colors in all the dresses. The old tinker put his tools together, and whispered to
     her, — </p>
    <p>"Bébée, as it is your feast day, come and stroll in St. Hubert's gallery, and I will buy you
     a little gilt heart, or a sugar-apple stick, or a ribbon, and we can see the puppet show
     afterwards, eh?"</p>
    <p>But the children were waiting at home: she would not spend the evening in the city; she only
     thought she would just kneel a moment in the cathedral and say a little prayer or two for a
     minute — the saints were so good in giving her so many friends.</p>
    <p>There is something very touching in the Flemish peasant's relation with his Deity. It is all
     very vague to him: a jumble of veneration and familiarity, of sanctity and profanity, without
     any thought of being familiar, or any idea of being profane.</p>
    <p>There is a homely poetry, an innocent affectionateness in it, characteristic of the people.
     He talks to his good angel Michael, and to his friend that dear little Jesus, much as he would
     talk to the shoemaker over the way, or the cooper's child in the doorway.</p>
    <p>It is a very unreasonable, foolish, clumsy sort of religion, this theology in wooden shoes;
     it is half grotesque, half pathetic; the grandmothers pass it on to the grandchildren as they
     pass the bowl of potatoes round the stove in the long winter nights; it is as silly as
     possible, but it comforts them as they carry fagots over the frozen canals or wear their eyes
     blind over the squares of lace; and it has in it the supreme pathos of any perfect confidence,
     of any utterly childlike and undoubting trust.</p>
    <p>This had been taught to Bébée, and she went to sleep every night in the firm belief that the
     sixteen little angels of the Flemish prayer kept watch and ward over her bed. For the rest,
     being poetical, as these north folks are not, and having in her — wherever it came from, poor
     little soul — a warmth of fancy and a spirituality of vision not at all northern, she had mixed
     up her religion with the fairies of Antoine's stories, and the demons in which the Flemish
     folks are profound believers, and the flowers into which she put all manner of sentient life,
     until her religion was a fantastic medley, so entangled that poor Father Francis had given up
     in despair any attempt to arrange it more correctly. Indeed, being of the peasantry himself, he
     was not so very full sure in his own mind that demons were not bodily presences, quite as real
     and often much more tangible than saints. Anyway, he let her alone; and she believed in the
     goodness of God as she believed in the shining of the sun.</p>
    <p>People looked after her as she went through the twisting, picture-like streets, where
     sunlight fell still between the peaked high roofs, and lamps were here and there lit in the
     bric-à-brac shops and the fruit stalls.</p>
    <p>Her little muslin cap blew back like the wings of a white butterfly. Her sunny hair caught
     the last sun-rays. Her feet were fair in the brown wooden shoes. Under the short woollen skirts
     the grace of her pretty limbs moved freely. Her broad silver clasps shone like a shield, and
     she was utterly unconscious that any one looked; she was simply and gravely intent on reaching
     St. Gudule to say her one prayer and not keep the children waiting.</p>
    <p>Some one leaning idly over a balcony in the street that is named after Mary of Burgundy saw
     her going thus. He left the balcony and went down his stairs and followed her.</p>
    <p>The sun-dazzle on the silver had first caught his sight; and then he had looked downward at
     the pretty feet.</p>
    <p>These are the chances women call Fate.</p>
    <p>Bébée entered the cathedral. It was quite empty. Far away at the west end there was an old
     custodian asleep on a bench, and a woman kneeling. That was all.</p>
    <p>Bébée made her salutations to the high altar, and stole on into the chapel of the Saint
     Sacrament; it was the one that she loved best.</p>
    <p>She said her prayer and thanked the saints for all their gifts and goodness, her clasped hand
     against her silver shield, her basket on the pavement by her, abovehead the sunset rays
     streaming purple and crimson and golden through the painted windows that are the wonder of the
     world.</p>
    <p>When her prayer was done she still kneeled there; her head thrown back to watch the light,
     her hands clasped still, and on her upturned face the look that made the people say, "What does
     she see? — the angels or the dead?"</p>
    <p>She forgot everything. She forgot the cherries at home, and the children even. She was
     looking upward at the stories of the painted panes; she was listening to the message of the
     dying sun-rays; she was feeling vaguely, wistfully, unutterably the tender beauty of the sacred
     place and the awful wonder of the world in which she with her sixteen years was all alone, like
     a little blue corn-flower among the wheat that goes for grist and the barley that makes men
     drunk.</p>
    <p>For she was alone, though she had so many friends. Quite alone sometimes; for God had been
     cruel to her, and had made her a lark without song.</p>
    <p>When the sun faded and the beautiful casements lost all glow and meaning, Bébée rose with a
     startled look — had she been dreaming? — was it night? — would the children be sorry, and go
     supperless to bed?</p>
    <p>"Have you a rosebud left to sell to me?" a man's voice said not far off; it was low and
     sweet, as became the Sacrament Chapel.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked up; she did not quite know what she saw: only dark eyes smiling into hers.</p>
    <p>By the instinct of habit she sought in her basket and found three moss-roses. She held them
     out to him.</p>
    <p>"I do not sell flowers here, but I will <emph>give</emph> them to you," she said, in her pretty
     grave childish fashion.</p>
    <p>"I often want flowers," said the stranger, as he took the buds. "Where do you sell yours? — in
     the market?"</p>
    <p>"In the Grande Place."</p>
    <p>"Will you tell me your name, pretty one?"</p>
    <p>"I am Bébée."</p>
    <p>There were people coming into the church. The bells were booming abovehead for vespers. There
     was a shuffle of chairs and a stir of feet. Boys in white went to and fro, lighting the
     candles. Great clouds of shadow drifted up into the roof and hid the angels.</p>
    <p>She nodded her little head to him.</p>
    <p>"Good night; I cannot stay. I have a cake at home to-night, and the children are
     waiting."</p>
    <p>"Ah! that is important, no doubt, indeed. Will you buy some more cakes for the children from
     me?"</p>
    <p>He slid a gold piece in her hand. She looked at it in amaze. In the green lanes by Laeken no
     one ever saw gold. Then she gave it him back.</p>
    <p>"I will not take money in church, nor anywhere, except what the flowers are worth. Good
     night."</p>
    <p>He followed her, and held back the heavy oak door for her, and went out into the air with
     her.</p>
    <p>It was dark already, but in the square there was still the cool bright primrose-colored
     evening light.</p>
    <p>Bébée's wooden shoes went pattering down the sloping and uneven stones. Her little gray
     figure ran quickly through the deep shade cast from the towers and walls. Her dreams had
     drifted away. She was thinking of the children and the cake.</p>
    <p>"You are in such a hurry because of the cake?" said her new customer, as he followed her.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked back at him with a smile in her blue eyes.</p>
    <p>"Yes, they will be waiting, you know, and there are cherries too."</p>
    <p>"It is a grand day with you, then?"</p>
    <p>"It is my fête day: I am sixteen."</p>
    <p>She was proud of this. She told it to the very dogs in the street.</p>
    <p>"Ah, you feel old, I dare say?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, quite old! They cannot call me a child any more."</p>
    <p>"Of course not, it would be ridiculous. Are those presents in your basket?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, every one of them." She paused a moment to lift the dead vine-leaves, and show him the
     beautiful shining red shoes. "Look! old Gringoire gave me these. I shall wear them at mass next
     Sunday. I never had a pair of shoes in my life."</p>
    <p>"But how will you wear shoes without stockings?"</p>
    <p>It was a snake cast into her Eden.</p>
    <p>She had never thought of it.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I can save money and buy some," she answered after a sad little pause. "But that I
     could not do till next year. They would cost several francs, I suppose."</p>
    <p>"Unless a good fairy gives them to you?"</p>
    <p>Bébée smiled; fairies were real things to her — relations indeed. She did not imagine that he
     spoke in jest.</p>
    <p>"Sometimes I pray very much and things come," she said softly. "When the Gloire de Dijon was
     cut back too soon one summer, and never blossomed, and we all thought it was dead, I prayed all
     day long for it, and never thought of anything else; and by autumn it was all in new leaf, and
     now its flowers are finer than ever."</p>
    <p>"But you watered it whilst you prayed, I suppose?"</p>
    <p>The sarcasm escaped her.</p>
    <p>She was wondering to herself whether it would be vain and wicked to pray for a pair of
     stockings: she thought she would go and ask Father Francis.</p>
    <p>By this time they were in the Rue Royale, and half-way down it. The lamps were lighted. A
     regiment was marching up it with a band playing. The windows were open, and people were
     laughing and singing in some of them. The light caught the white and gilded fronts of the
     houses. The pleasure-seeking crowds loitered along in the warmth of the evening.</p>
    <p>Bébée, suddenly roused from her thoughts by the loud challenge of the military music, looked
     round on the stranger, and motioned him back.</p>
    <p>"Sir, — I do not know you, — why should you come with me? Do not do it, please. You make me talk,
     and that makes me late."</p>
    <p>And she pushed her basket farther on her arm, and nodded to him and ran off — as fleetly as a
     hare through fern — among the press of the people.</p>
    <p>"To-morrow, little one," he answered her with a careless smile, and let her go unpursued.
     Above, from the open casement of a café, some young men and some painted women leaned out, and
     threw sweetmeats at him, as in carnival time.</p>
    <p>"A new model, — that pretty peasant?" they asked him.</p>
    <p>He laughed in answer, and went up the steps to join them; he dropped the moss-roses as he
     went, and trod on them, and did not wait.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
    <p>Bébée ran home as fast as her feet would take her.</p>
    <p>The children were all gathered about her gate in the dusky dewy evening; they met her with
     shouts of welcome and reproach intermingled; they had been watching for her since first the sun
     had grown low and red, and now the moon was risen.</p>
    <p>But they forgave her when they saw the splendor of her presents, and she showered out among
     them Père Melchior's horn of comfits.</p>
    <p>They dashed into the hut; they dragged the one little table out among the flowers; the
     cherries and cake were spread on it; and the miller's wife had given a big jug of milk, and
     Father Francis himself had sent some honeycomb.</p>
    <p>The early roses were full of scent in the dew; the great gillyflowers breathed\out fragrance
     in the dusk; the goat came and nibbled the sweetbrier unrebuked; the children repeated the
     Flemish bread-grace, with clasped hands and reverent eyes, "Oh, dear little Jesus, come and sup
     with us, and bring your beautiful Mother, too; we will not forget you are God." Then, that
     said, they ate, and drank, and laughed, and picked cherries from each other's mouths like
     little blackbirds; the big white dog gnawed a crust at their feet; old Krebs who had a fiddle,
     and could play it, came out and trilled them rude and ready Flemish tunes, such as Teniers or
     Mieris might have jumped to before an alehouse at the Kermesse; Bébée and the children joined
     hands, and danced round together in the broad white moonlight, on the grass by the water-side;
     the idlers came and sat about, the women netting or spinning, and the men smoking a pipe before
     bedtime; the rough hearty Flemish bubbled like a brook in gossip, or rung like a horn over a
     jest; Bébée and the children, tired of their play, grew quiet, and chanted together the "Ave
     Maria Stella Virginis"; a nightingale among the willows sang to the sleeping swans.</p>
    <p>All was happy, quiet, homely; lovely also in its simple way.</p>
    <p>They went early to their beds, as people must do who rise at dawn.</p>
    <p>Bébée leaned out a moment from her own little casement ere she too went to rest.</p>
    <p>Through an open lattice there sounded the murmur of some little child's prayer; the wind
     sighed among the willows; the nightingales sang on in the dark — all was still.</p>
    <p>Hard work awaited her on the morrow, and on all the other days of the year.</p>
    <p>She was only a little peasant — she must sweep, and spin, and dig, and delve, to get daily her
     bit of black bread, — but that night she was as happy as a little princess in a fairy tale; happy
     in her playmates, in her flowers, in her sixteen years, in her red shoes, in her silver
     buckles, because she was half a woman; happy in the dewy leaves, in the singing birds, in the
     hush of the night, in the sense of rest, in the fragrance of flowers, in the drifting changes
     of moon and cloud; happy because she was half a woman, because she was half a poet, because she
     was wholly a poet.</p>
    <p>"Oh, dear swans, how good it is to be sixteen! — how good it is to live at all! — do you not tell
     the willows so?" said Bébée to the gleam of silver under the dark leaves by the water's side,
     which showed her where her friends were sleeping, with their snowy wings closed over their
     stately heads, and the veiled gold and ruby of their eyes.</p>
    <p>The swans did not awake to answer.</p>
    <p>Only the nightingale answered from the willows, with Desdemona's song.</p>
    <p>But Bébée had never heard of Desdemona, and the willows had no sigh for her.</p>
    <p>"Good night!" she said, softly, to all the green dewy sleeping world, and then she lay down
     and slept herself. — The nightingale sang on, and the willows trembled.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
    <p>"If I could save a centime a day, I could buy a pair of stockings this time next year,"
     thought Bébée, locking her shoes with her other treasures in her drawer the next morning, and
     taking her broom and pail to wash down her little palace.</p>
    <p>But a centime a day is a great deal in Brabant, when one has not always enough for bare
     bread, and when, in the long chill winter, one must weave thread lace all through the short
     daylight for next to nothing at all; for there are so many women in Brabant, and every one of
     them, young or old, can make lace, and if one do not like the pitiful wage, one may leave it
     and go and die, for what the master lacemakers care or know; there will always be enough, many
     more than enough, to twist the thread round the bobbins, and weave the bridal veils, and the
     trains for the courts.</p>
    <p>"And besides, if I can save a centime, the Varnhart children ought to have it," thought
     Bébée, as she swept the dust together. It was so selfish of her to be dreaming about a pair of
     stockings, when those little things often went for days on a stew of nettles.</p>
    <p>So she looked at her own pretty feet, — pretty and slender, and arched, rosy, and fair, and
     uncramped by the pressure of leather, — and resigned her day-dream with a brave heart, as she put
     up her broom and went out to weed, and hoe, and trim, and prune the garden that had been for
     once neglected the night before.</p>
    <p>"One could not move half so easily in stockings," she thought with true philosophy as she
     worked among the black, fresh, sweet-smelling mould, and kissed a rose now and then as she
     passed one.</p>
    <p>When she got into the city that day, her rush-bottomed chair, which was always left upside
     down in case rain should fall in the night, was set ready for her, and on its seat was a gay,
     gilded box, such as rich people give away full of bonbons.</p>
    <p>Bébée stood and looked from the box to the Broodhuis, from the Broodhuis to the box; she
     glanced around, but no one had come there so early as she, except the tinker, who was busy
     quarrelling with his wife and letting his smelting fire burn a hole in his breeches.</p>
    <p>"The box was certainly for her, since it was set upon her chair?" — Bébée pondered a moment;
     then little by little opened the lid.</p>
    <p>Within, on a nest of rose-satin, were two pair of silk stockings! — real silk! — with the
     prettiest clocks worked up their sides in color!</p>
    <p>Bébée gave a little scream, and stood still, the blood hot in her cheeks; no one heard her,
     the tinker's wife, who alone was near, having just wished Heaven to send a judgment on her
     husband, was busy putting out his smoking smallclothes. It is a way that women and wives have,
     and they never see the bathos of it.</p>
    <p>The place filled gradually.</p>
    <p>The customary crowds gathered. The business of the day began underneath the multitudinous
     tones of the chiming bells. Bébée's business began too; she put the box behind her with a
     beating heart, and tied up her flowers.</p>
    <p>It was the fairies, of course! but they had never set a rush-bottomed chair on its legs
     before, and this action of theirs frightened her.</p>
    <p>It was rather an empty morning. She sold little, and there was the more time to think.</p>
    <p>About an hour after noon a voice addressed her, — </p>
    <p>"Have you more moss-roses for me?"</p>
    <p>Bébée looked up with a smile, and found some. It was her companion of the cathedral. She had
     thought much of the red shoes and the silver clasps, but she had thought nothing at all of
     him.</p>
    <p>"You are not too proud to be paid to-day?" he said, giving her a silver franc; he would not
     alarm her with any more gold; she thanked him, and slipped it in her little leathern pouch, and
     went on sorting some clove-pinks.</p>
    <p>"You do not seem to remember me?" he said, with a little sadness.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I remember you," said Bébée, lifting her frank eyes. "But you know I speak to so many
     people, and they are all nothing to me."</p>
    <p>"Who is anything to you?" It was softly and insidiously spoken, but it awoke no echo.</p>
    <p>"Varnhart's children," she answered him, instantly. "And old Annémie by the wharfside — and
     Tambour — and Antoine's grave — and the starling — and, of course, above all, the flowers."</p>
    <p>"And the fairies, I suppose? — though they do nothing for you."</p>
    <p>She looked at him eagerly, — </p>
    <p>"They have done something to-day. I have found a box, and some stockings — such beautiful
     stockings! Silk ones! Is it not very odd?"</p>
    <p>"It is more odd they should have forgotten you so long. May I see them?"</p>
    <p>"I cannot show them to you now. Those ladies are going to buy. But you can see them later — if
     you wait."</p>
    <p>"I will wait and paint the Broodhuis."</p>
    <p>"So many people do that; you are a painter then?"</p>
    <p>"Yes — in a way."</p>
    <p>He sat down on an edge of the stall, and spread his things there, and sketched, whilst the
     traffic went on around them. He was very many years older than she; handsome, with a dark, and
     changeful, and listless face; he wore brown velvet, and had a red ribbon at his throat; he
     looked a little as Egmont might have done when wooing Claire.</p>
    <p>Bébée, as she sold the flowers and took the change fifty times in the hour, glanced at him
     now and then, and watched the movements of his hands, she could not have told why.</p>
    <p>Always among men and women, always in the crowds of the streets, people were nothing to her;
     she went through them as through a field of standing corn, — only in the field she would have
     tarried for poppies, and in the town she tarried for no one.</p>
    <p>She dealt with men as with women, simply, truthfully, frankly, with the innocent fearlessness
     of a child. When they told her she was pretty, she smiled; it was just as they said that her
     flowers were sweet.</p>
    <p>But this man's hands moved so swiftly; and as she saw her Broodhuis growing into color and
     form beneath them, she could not choose but look now and then, and twice she gave her change
     wrong.</p>
    <p>He spoke to her rarely, and sketched on and on in rapid bold strokes the quaint graces and
     massive richness of the Maison du Roi.</p>
    <p>There is no crowd so busy in Brabant that it will not find leisure to stare. The Fleming or
     the Walloon has nothing of the Frenchman's courtesy; he is rough and rude; he remains a peasant
     even when town bred, and the surly insolence of the "Gueux" is in him still. He is kindly to
     his fellows, though not to beasts; he is shrewd, patient, thrifty, industrious, and good in
     very many ways, but civil never.</p>
    <p>A good score of them left off their occupations and clustered round the painter, staring,
     chattering, pushing, pointing, as though a brush had never been seen in all the land of
     Rubens.</p>
    <p>Bébée, ashamed of her people, got up from her chair and rebuked them.</p>
    <p>"Oh, men of Brussels; fie then for shame!" she called to them as clearly as a robin sings.
     "Did never you see a drawing before? and are there not saints and martyrs enough to look at in
     the galleries? and have you never some better thing to do than to gape wide-mouthed at a
     stranger? What laziness — ah! Just worthy of a people who sleep and smoke while their dogs work
     for them! Go away, all of you; look, there comes the gendarme — it will be the worse for you.
     Sir, sit under my stall; they will not dare trouble you then."</p>
    <p>He moved under the awning, thanking her with a smile; and the people, laughing, shuffled
     unwillingly aside and let him paint on in peace. It was only little Bébée, but they had spoilt
     the child from her infancy, and were used to obey her.</p>
    <p>The painter took a long time. He set about it with the bold ease of one used to all the
     intricacies of form and color, and he had the skill of a master. But he spent more than half
     the time looking idly at the humors of the populace or watching how the treasures of Bébée's
     garden went away one by one in the hands of strangers.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, ever and again, sitting on the edge of her stall, with his colors and brushes
     tossed out on the board, he talked to her, and, with the soft imperceptible skill of long
     practice in those arts, he drew out the details of her little simple life.</p>
    <p>There were not always people to buy, and whilst she rested and sheltered the flowers from the
     sun, she answered him willingly, and in one of her longer rests showed him the wonderful
     stockings.</p>
    <p>"Do you think it <emph>could</emph> be the fairies?" she asked him a little doubtfully.</p>
    <p>It was easy to make her believe any fantastical nonsense; but her fairies were ethereal
     divinities. She could scarcely believe that they had laid that box on her chair.</p>
    <p>"Impossible to doubt it!" he replied, unhesitatingly. "Given a belief in fairies at all, why
     should there be any limit to what they can do? It is the same with the saints, is it not?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Bébée, thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>The saints were mixed up in her imagination with the fairies in an intricacy that would have
     defied the best reasonings of Father Francis.</p>
    <p>"Well, then, you will wear the stockings, will you not? Only, believe me, your feet are far
     prettier without them."</p>
    <p>Bébée laughed happily, and took another peep in the cosy rose-satin nest. But her little face
     had a certain perplexity. Suddenly she turned on him.</p>
    <p>"Did not <emph>you</emph> put them there?"</p>
    <p>"I? — never!"</p>
    <p>"Are you quite sure?"</p>
    <p>"Quite; but why ask?"</p>
    <p>"Because," said Bébée, shutting the box resolutely and pushing it a little away, — "because I
     would not take it if you did. You are a stranger, and a present is a debt, so Antoine always
     said."</p>
    <p>"Why take a present then from the Varnhart children, or your old friend who gave you the
     clasps?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, that is very different. When people are very, very poor, equally poor, the one with the
     other, little presents that they save for and make with such a difficulty are just things that
     are a pleasure; sacrifices; like your sitting up with a sick person at night, and then she sits
     up with you another year when you want it. Do you not know?"</p>
    <p>"I know you talk very prettily. But why should you not take any one else's present, though he
     may not be poor?"</p>
    <p>"Because I could not return it."</p>
    <p>"Could you not?"</p>
    <p>The smile in his eyes dazzled her a little; it was so strange, and yet had so much light in
     it; but she did not understand him one whit.</p>
    <p>"No; how could I?" she said earnestly. "If I were to save for two years, I could not get
     francs enough to buy anything worth giving back; and I should be so unhappy, thinking of the
     debt of it always. Do tell me if you put those stockings there?"</p>
    <p>"No"; he looked at her, and the trivial lie faltered and died away; the eyes, clear as
     crystal, questioned him so innocently. "Well, if I did?" he said, frankly; "you wished for
     them; what harm was there? Will you be so cruel as to refuse them from me?"</p>
    <p>The tears sprang into Bébée's eyes. She was sorry to lose the beautiful box, but more sorry
     he had lied to her.</p>
    <p>"It was very kind and good," she said, regretfully. "But I cannot think why you should have
     done it, as you had never known me at all. And, indeed, I could not take them, because Antoine
     would not let me if he were alive; and if I gave you a flower every day all the year round I
     should not pay you the worth of them, it would be quite impossible; and why should you tell me
     falsehoods about such a thing? A falsehood is never a thing for a man."</p>
    <p>She shut the box and pushed it towards him, and turned to the selling of her bouquets. Her
     voice shook a little as she tied up a bunch of mignonette and told the price of it.</p>
    <p>Those beautiful stockings! why had she ever seen them, and why had he told her a lie?</p>
    <p>It made her heart heavy. For the first time in her brief life the Broodhuis seemed to frown
     between her and the sun.</p>
    <p>Undisturbed, he painted on and did not look at her.</p>
    <p>The day was nearly done. The people began to scatter. The shadows grew very long. He painted,
     not glancing once elsewhere than at his study. Bébée's baskets were quite empty.</p>
    <p>She rose, and lingered, and regarded him wistfully: he was angered; perhaps she had been
     rude? Her little heart failed her.</p>
    <p>If he would only look up!</p>
    <p>But he did not look up; he kept his handsome dark face studiously over the canvas of the
     Broodhuis. She would have seen a smile in his eyes if he had lifted them; but he never raised
     his lids.</p>
    <p>Bébée hesitated: take the stockings she would not; but perhaps she had refused them too
     roughly. She wished so that he would look up and save her speaking first; but he knew what he
     was about too warily and well to help her thus.</p>
    <p>She waited awhile, then took one little red moss-rosebud that she had saved all day in a
     corner of her basket, and held it out to him frankly, shyly, as a peace offering.</p>
    <p>"Was I rude? I did not mean to be. But I cannot take the stockings; and why did you tell me
     that falsehood?"</p>
    <p>He took the rosebud and rose too, and smiled; but he did not meet her eyes.</p>
    <p>"Let us forget the whole matter; it is not worth a sou. If you do not take the box, leave it;
     it is of no use to me."</p>
    <p>"I cannot take it."</p>
    <p>She knew she was doing right. How was it that he could make her feel as though she were
     acting wrongly?</p>
    <p>"Leave it then, I say. You are not the first woman, my dear, who has quarrelled with a wish
     fulfilled. It is a way your sex has of rewarding gods and men. — Here, you old witch, here is a
     treasure-trove for you. You can sell it for ten francs in the town anywhere."</p>
    <p>As he spoke he tossed the casket and the stockings in it to an old decrepit woman, who was
     passing by with a baker's cart drawn by a dog; and, not staying to heed her astonishment,
     gathered his colors and easel together.</p>
    <p>The tears swam in Bébée's eyes as she saw the box whirled through the air.</p>
    <p>She had done right; she was sure she had done right.</p>
    <p>He was a stranger, and she could never have repaid him; but he made her feel herself wayward
     and ungrateful, and it was hard to see the beautiful fairy gift borne away forever by the
     chuckling, hobbling, greedy old baker's woman. If he had only taken it himself, she would have
     been glad then to have been brave and to have done her duty.</p>
    <p>But it was not in his design that she should be glad.</p>
    <p>He saw her tears, but he seemed not to see them.</p>
    <p>"Good night, Bébée," he said carelessly, as he sauntered aside from her. "Good night, my
     dear. To-morrow I will finish my painting; but I will not offend you by any more gifts."</p>
    <p>Bébée lifted her drooped head, and looked him in the eyes eagerly, with a certain sturdy
     resolve and timid wistfulness intermingled in her look.</p>
    <p>"Sir, see, you speak to me quite wrongly," she said with a quick accent, that had pride as
     well as pain in it. "Say it was kind to bring me what I wished for; yes, it was kind I know;
     but you never saw me till last night, and I cannot tell even your name; and it is very wrong to
     lie to any one, even to a little thing like me; and I am only Bébée, and cannot give you
     anything back, because I have only just enough to feed myself and the starling, and not always
     that in winter. I thank you very much for what you wished to do; but if I had taken those
     things, I think you would have thought me very mean and full of greed; and Antoine always said,
     'Do not take what you cannot pay — not ever what you cannot pay — that is the way to walk with pure
     feet.' Perhaps I spoke ill, because they spoil me, and they say I am too swift to say my mind.
     But I am not thankless — not thankless, indeed — it is only I could not take what I cannot pay.
     That is all. You are angry still — not now — no?"</p>
    <p>There was, anxiety in the pleading. What did it matter to her what a stranger thought?</p>
    <p>And yet Bébée's heart was heavy as he laughed a little coldly, and bade her good day, and
     left her alone to go out of the city homewards. A sense of having done wrong weighed on her; of
     having been rude and ungrateful.</p>
    <p>She had no heart for the children that evening. Mère Krebs was sitting out before her door
     shelling peas, and called to her to come in and have a drop of coffee. Krebs had come in from
     Vilvöorde fair, and brought a stock of rare good berries with him. But Bébée thanked her, and
     went on to her own garden to work.</p>
    <p>She had always liked to sit out on the quaint wooden steps of the mill and under the red
     shadow of the sails, watching the swallows flutter to and fro in the sunset, and hearing the
     droll frogs croak in the rushes, while the old people told her tales of the time of how in
     their babyhood they had run out, fearful yet fascinated, to see the beautiful Scots Grays flash
     by in the murky night, and the endless line of guns and caissons crawl black as a snake through
     the summer dust and the trampled corn, going out past the woods to Waterloo.</p>
    <p>But to-night she had no fancy for it: she wanted to be alone with the flowers.</p>
    <p>Though, to be sure, they had been very heartless when Antoine's coffin had gone past them,
     still they had sympathy; the daisies smiled at her with their golden eyes, and the roses
     dropped tears on her hand, just as her mood might be; the flowers were closer friends, after
     all, than any human souls; and besides, she could say so much to them!</p>
    <p>Flowers belong to fairyland; the flowers and the birds and the butterflies are all that the
     world has kept of its Golden Age; the only perfectly beautiful things on earth, joyous,
     innocent, half divine, useless, say they who are wiser than God.</p>
    <p>Bébée went home and worked among her flowers.</p>
    <p>A little laborious figure, with her petticoats twisted high, and her feet wet with the night
     dews, and her back bowed to the hoeing and clipping and raking among the blossoming plants.</p>
    <p>"How late you are working to-night, Bébée!" one or two called out, as they passed the gate.
     She looked up and smiled; but went on working while the white moon rose.</p>
    <p>She did not know what ailed her.</p>
    <p>She went to bed without supper, leaving her bit of bread and bowl of goat's milk to make a
     meal for the fowls in the morning.</p>
    <p>"Little ugly, shameful, naked feet!" she said to them, sitting on the edge of her mattress,
     and looking at them in the moonlight. They were very pretty feet, and would not have been half
     so pretty in silk hose and satin shoon; but she did not know that: he had told her she wanted
     those vanities.</p>
    <p>She sat still a long while, her rosy feet swaying to and fro like two roses that grow on one
     stalk and hang down in the wind. The little lattice was open; the sweet and dusky garden was
     beyond; there was a hand's breadth of sky, in which a single star was shining; the leaves of
     the vine hid all the rest.</p>
    <p>But for once she saw none of it.</p>
    <p>She only saw the black Broodhuis; the red and gold sunset overhead; the gray stones, with the
     fallen rose leaves and crushed fruits; and in the shadows two dark, reproachful eyes, that
     looked at hers.</p>
    <p>Had she been ungrateful?</p>
    <p>The little tender, honest heart of her was troubled and oppressed. For once, that night she
     slept ill.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
    <p>All the next day she sat under the yellow awning, but she sat alone.</p>
    <p>It was market day; there were many strangers. Flowers were in demand. The copper pieces were
     ringing against one another all the hours through in her leathern bag. The cobbler was in such
     good humor that he forgot to quarrel with his wife. The fruit was in such plenty that they gave
     her a leaf-full of white and red currants for her noonday dinner. And the people split their
     sides at the Cheap John's jokes; he was so droll. No one saw the leaks in his kettles or the
     hole in his bellows, or the leg that was lacking to his milking stool.</p>
    <p>Everybody was gay and merry that day. But Bébée's eyes looked wistfully over the throng, and
     did not find what they sought. Somehow the day seemed dull, and the square empty.</p>
    <p>The stones and the timbers around seemed more than ever full of a thousand stories that they
     would not tell her because she knew nothing, and was only Bébée.</p>
    <p>She had never known a dull hour before. She, a little bright, industrious, gay thing, whose
     hands were always full of work, and whose head was always full of fancies, even in the grimmest
     winter time, when she wove the lace in the gray, chilly workroom, with the frost on the
     casements, and the mice running out in their hunger over the bare brick floor.</p>
    <p>That bare room was a sad enough place sometimes, when the old women would bewail how they
     starved on the pittance they gained, and the young women sighed for their aching heads and
     their failing eyesight, and the children dropped great tears on the bobbins, because they had
     come out without a crust to break their fast.</p>
    <p>She had been sad there often for others, but she had never been dull — not with this
     unfamiliar, desolate, dreary dulness, that seemed to take all the mirth out of the busy life
     around her, and all the color out of the blue sky above. Why, she had no idea herself. She
     wondered if she were going to be ill; she had never been ill in her life, being strong as a
     little bird that has never known cage or captivity.</p>
    <p>When the day was done, Bébée gave a quick sigh as she looked across the square. She had so
     wanted to tell him that she was not ungrateful; and she had a little moss-rose ready, with a
     sprig of sweetbrier, and a tiny spray of maidenhair fern that grew under the willows, which she
     had kept covered up with a leaf of sycamore all the day long.</p>
    <p>No one would have it now.</p>
    <p>The child went out of the place sadly as the carillon rang. There was only the moss-rose in
     her basket, and the red and white currants that had been given her for her dinner.</p>
    <p>She went along the twisting, many-colored, quaintly fashioned streets, till she came to the
     water-side.</p>
    <p>It is very ancient there still, there are all manner of old buildings, black and brown and
     gray, peaked roofs, gabled windows, arched doors, crumbling bridges, twisted galleries leaning
     to touch the dark surface of the canal, dusky wharves crowded with barrels, and bales, and
     cattle, and timber, and all the various freightage that the good ships come and go with all the
     year round, to and from the ZuyderZee, and the Baltic water, and the wild Northumbrian shores,
     and the iron-bound Scottish headlands, and the pretty gray Norman seaports, and the white sandy
     dunes of Holland, with the toy towns and the straight poplar-trees.</p>
    <p>Bébée was fond of watching the brigs and barges, that looked so big to her, with their
     national flags flying, and their tall masts standing thick as grass, and their tawny sails
     flapping in the wind, and about them the sweet, strong smell of that strange, unknown thing,
     the sea.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the sailors would talk with her; sometimes some old salt, sitting astride of a
     cask, would tell her a mariner's tale of far-away lands and mysteries of the deep; sometimes
     some curly-headed cabin-boy would give her a shell or a plume of seaweed, and try and make her
     understand what the wonderful wild water was like, which was not quiet and sluggish and dusky
     as this canal was, but was forever changing and moving, and curling and leaping, and making
     itself now blue as her eyes, now black as that thunder-cloud, now white as the snow that the
     winter wind tossed, now pearl hued and opaline as the convolvulus that blew in her own
     garden.</p>
    <p>And Bébée would listen, with the shell in her lap, and try to understand, and gaze at the
     ships and then at the sky beyond them, and try to figure to herself those strange countries to
     which these ships were always going, and saw in fancy all the blossoming orchard province of
     green France, and all the fir-clothed hills and rushing rivers of the snow-locked Swedish
     shore, and saw too, doubtless, many lands that had no place at all except in dreamland, and
     were more beautiful even than the beauty of the earth, as poets' countries are, to their own
     sorrow, oftentimes.</p>
    <p>But this dull day Bébée did not go down upon the wharf; she did not want the sailors' tales;
     she saw the masts and the bits of bunting that streamed from them, and they made her restless,
     which they had never done before.</p>
    <p>Instead she went in at a dark old door and climbed up a steep staircase that went up and up,
     as though she were mounting St. Gudule's belfry towers; and at the top of it entered a little
     chamber in the roof, where one square unglazed hole that served for light looked out upon the
     canal, with all its crowded craft, from the dainty schooner yacht, fresh as gilding and
     holystone could make her, that was running for pleasure to the Scheldt, to the rude, clumsy
     coal barge, black as night, that bore the rough diamonds of Belgium to the snow-buried roofs of
     Christiania and Stromstad.</p>
    <p>In the little dark attic there was a very old woman in a red petticoat and a high cap, who
     sat against the window, and pricked out lace patterns with a pin on thick paper. She was
     eighty-five years old, and could hardly keep body and soul together.</p>
    <p>Bébée, running to her, kissed her. "Oh, mother Annémie, look here! Beautiful red and white
     currants, and a roll; I saved them for you. They are the first currants we have seen this year.
     Me? oh, for me, I have eaten more than are good! You know I pick fruit like a sparrow, always.
     Dear mother Annémie, are you better? Are you quite sure you are better to-day?"</p>
    <p>The little old withered woman, brown as a walnut and meagre as a rush, took the currants, and
     smiled with a childish glee, and began to eat them, blessing the child with each crumb she
     broke off the bread.</p>
    <p>"Why had you not a grandmother of your own, my little one?" she mumbled. "How good you would
     have been to her, Bébée!"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Bébée seriously, but her mind could not grasp the idea. It was easier for her to
     believe the fanciful lily parentage of Antoine's stories. "How much work have you done,
     Annémie? Oh, all that? all that? But there is enough for a week. You work too early and too
     late, you dear Annémie."</p>
    <p>"Nay, Bébée, when one has to get one's bread that cannot be. But I am afraid my eyes are
     failing. That rose now, is it well done?"</p>
    <p>"Beautifully done. Would the Baës take them if they were not? You know he is one that cuts
     every centime in four pieces."</p>
    <p>"Ah! sharp enough, sharp enough, that is true. But I am always afraid of my eyes. I do not
     see the flags out there so well as I used to do."</p>
    <p>"Because the sun is so bright, Annémie; that is all. I myself, when I have been sitting all
     day in the place in the light, the flowers look pale to me. And you know it is not age with
      <emph>me</emph>, Annémie?"</p>
    <p>The old woman and the young girl laughed together at that droll idea.</p>
    <p>"You have a merry heart, dear little one," said old Annémie. "The saints keep it to you
     always."</p>
    <p>"May I tidy the room a little?"</p>
    <p>"To be sure, dear, and thank you too. I have not much time, you see; and somehow my back
     aches badly when I stoop."</p>
    <p>"And it is so damp here for you, over all that water!" said Bébée as she swept and dusted and
     set to rights the tiny place, and put in a little broken pot a few sprays of honeysuckle and
     rosemary that she had brought with her. "It is so damp here. You should have come and lived in
     my hut with me, Annémie, and sat out under the vine all day, and looked after the chickens for
     me when I was in the town. They are such mischievous little souls; as soon as my back is turned
     one or other is sure to push through the roof, and get out among the flower-beds. Will you
     never change your mind, and live with me, Annémie? I am sure you would be happy, and the
     starling says your name quite plain, and he is such a funny bird to talk to; you never would
     tire of him. Will you never come? It is so bright there, and green and sweet smelling; and to
     think you never even have seen it! — and the swans and all, — it is a shame."</p>
    <p>"No, dear," said old Annémie, eating her last bunch of currants. "You have said so so often,
     and you are good and mean it, that I know. But I could not leave the water. It would kill me.
     Out of this window you know I saw my Jeannot's brig go away — away — away — till the masts were lost
     in the mists. Going with iron to Norway; the 'Fleur d'Epine' of this town, a good ship, and a
     sure, and her mate; and as proud as might be, and with a little blest Mary in lead round his
     throat. She was to be back in port in eight months, bringing timber. Eight months — that brought
     Easter time. But she never came. Never, never, never, you know. I sat here watching them come
     and go, and my child sickened and died, and the summer passed, and the autumn, and all the
     while I looked — looked — looked; for the brigs are all much alike; and only her I always saw as
     soon as she hove in sight (because he tied a hank of flax to her mizzen-mast); and when he was
     home safe and sound I spun the hank into hose for him; that was a fancy of his, and for eleven
     voyages, one on another, he had never missed to tie the flax nor I to spin the hose. But the
     hank of flax I never saw this time; nor the brave brig; nor my good man with his sunny blue
     eyes. Only one day in winter, when the great blocks of ice were smashing hither and thither, a
     coaster came in and brought tidings of how off in the Danish waters they had come on a
     water-logged brig, and had boarded her, and had found her empty, and her hull riven in two, and
     her crew all drowned and dead beyond any manner of doubt. And on her stern there was her name
     painted white, the 'Fleur d'Epine,' of Brussels, as plain as name could be; and that was all we
     ever knew: what evil had struck her, or how they had perished, nobody ever told. Only the
     coaster brought that bit of beam away, with the 'Fleur d'Epine' writ clear upon it. But you see
     I never <emph>know</emph> my man is dead. Any day — who can say? — any one of those ships may bring him
     aboard of her, and he may leap out on the wharf there, and come running up the stairs as he
     used to do, and cry, in his merry voice, 'Annémie, Annémie, here is more flax to spin, here is
     more hose to weave!' For that was always his homeward word; no matter whether he had had fair
     weather or foul, he always knotted the flax to his masthead. So you see, dear, I could not
     leave here. For what if he came and found me away? He would say it was an odd fashion of
     mourning for him. And I could not do without the window, you know. I can watch all the brigs
     come in; and I can smell the shipping smell that I have loved all the days of my life; and I
     can see the lads heaving, and climbing, and furling, and mending their bits of canvas, and
     hauling their flags up and down. And then who can say? — the sea never took him, I think — I think
     I shall hear his voice before I die. For they do say that God is good."</p>
    <p>Bébée, sweeping very noiselessly, listened, and her eyes grew wistful and wondering. She had
     heard the story a thousand times; always in different words, but always the same little tale,
     and she knew how old Annémie was deaf to all the bells that tolled the time, and blind to all
     the whiteness of her hair and all the wrinkles of her face, and only thought of her sea-slain
     lover as he had been in the days of her youth.</p>
    <p>But this afternoon the familiar history had a new patheticalness for her, and as the old soul
     put aside with her palsied hand the square of canvas that screened the casement, and looked
     out, with her old dim sad eyes strained in the longing that God never answered, Bébée felt a
     strange chill at her own heart, and wondered to herself, — </p>
    <p>"What can it be to care for another creature like that? It must be so terrible, and yet it
     must be beautiful too. Does every one suffer like that?"</p>
    <p>She did not speak at all as she finished sweeping the bricks, and went down-stairs for a
     metal cruche full of water, and set over a little charcoal on the stove the old woman's brass
     soup kettle with her supper of stewing cabbage.</p>
    <p>Annémie did not hear or notice; she was still looking out of the hole in the wall on to the
     masts, and the sails, and the water.</p>
    <p>It was twilight.</p>
    <p>From the barges and brigs there came the smell of the sea. The sailors were shouting to each
     other. The craft were crowded close, and lost in the growing darkness. On the other side of the
     canal the belfries were ringing for vespers.</p>
    <p>"Eleven voyages one and another, and he never forgot to tie the flax to the mast," Annémie
     murmured, with her old wrinkled face leaning out into the gray air. "It used to fly there, — one
     could see it coming up half a mile off, — just a pale yellow flake on the wind, like a tress of
     my hair, he would say. No, no, I could not go away; he may come to-night, to-morrow, any time;
     he is not drowned, not my man; he was all I had, and God is good, they say."</p>
    <p>Bébée listened and looked; then kissed the old shaking hand and took up the lace patterns and
     went softly out of the room without speaking.</p>
    <p>When old Annémie watched at the window it was useless to seek for any word or sign of her:
     people said that she had never been quite right in her brain since that fatal winter noon sixty
     years before, when the coaster had brought into port the broken beam of the good brig "Fleur
     d'Epine."</p>
    <p>Bébée did not know about that, nor heed whether her wits were right or not.</p>
    <p>She had known the old creature in the lace-room where Annémie pricked out designs, and she
     had conceived a great regard and sorrow for her; and when Annémie had become too ailing and
     aged to go herself any longer to the lace-maker's place, Bébée had begged leave for her to have
     the patterns at home, and had carried them to and fro for her for the last three or four years,
     doing many other little useful services for the lone old soul as well, — services which Annémie
     hardly perceived, she had grown so used to them, and her feeble intelligence was so sunk in the
     one absorbing idea that she must watch all the days through and all the years through for the
     coming of the dead man and the lost brig.</p>
    <p>Bébée put the lace patterns in her basket, and trotted home, her sabots clattering on the
     stones.</p>
    <p>"What it must be to care for any one like that!" she thought, and by some vague association
     of thought that she could not have pursued, she lifted the leaves and looked at the
     moss-rosebud.</p>
    <p>It was quite dead.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
    <p>As she got clear of the city and out on her country road, a shadow Fell across her in the
     evening light.</p>
    <p>"Have you had a good day, little one?" asked a voice that made her stop with a curious vague
     expectancy and pleasure.</p>
    <p>"It is you!" she said, with a little cry, as she saw her friend of the silk stockings leaning
     on a gate midway in the green and solitary road that leads to Laeken.</p>
    <p>"Yes, it is I," he answered, as he joined her. "Have you forgiven me, Bébée?"</p>
    <p>She looked at him with frank, appealing eyes, like those of a child in fault.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I did not sleep all night!" she said, simply. "I thought I had been rude and ungrateful,
     and I could not be sure I had done right, though to have done otherwise would certainly have
     been wrong."</p>
    <p>He laughed.</p>
    <p>"Well, that is a clearer deduction than is to be drawn from most moral uncertainties. Do not
     think twice about the matter, my dear. I have not, I assure you."</p>
    <p>"No!"</p>
    <p>She was a little disappointed. It seemed such an immense thing to her; and she had lain awake
     all the night, turning it about in her little brain, and appealing vainly for help in it to the
     sixteen sleep-angels.</p>
    <p>"No, indeed. And where are you going so fast, as if those wooden shoes of yours were sandals
     of Mercury?"</p>
    <p>"Mercury — is that a shoemaker?"</p>
    <p>"No, my dear. He did a terrible bit of cobbling once, when he made Woman. But he did not shoe
     her feet with swiftness that I know of; she only runs away to be run after, and if you do not
     pursue her, she comes back — always."</p>
    <p>Bébée did not understand at all.</p>
    <p>"I thought God made women," she said, a little awe-stricken.</p>
    <p>"You call it God. People three thousand years ago called it Mercury or Hermes. Both mean the
     same thing, — mere words to designate an unknown quality. Where are you going? Does your home lie
     here?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, onward, quite far onward," said Bébée, wondering that he had forgotten all she had told
     him the day before about her hut, her garden, and her neighbors. "You did not come and finish
     your picture to-day: why was that? I had a rosebud for you, but it is dead now."</p>
    <p>"I went to Anvers. You looked for me a little, then?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, all day long. For I was so afraid I had been ungrateful."</p>
    <p>"That is very pretty of you. Women are never grateful, my dear, except when they are very
     ill-treated. Mercury, whom we were talking of, gave them, among other gifts, a dog's
     heart."</p>
    <p>Bébée felt bewildered; she did not reason about it, but the idle, shallow, cynical tone
     pained her by its levity and its unlikeness to the sweet, still, gray summer evening.</p>
    <p>"Why are you in such a hurry?" he pursued. "The night is cool, and it is only seven o'clock.
     I will walk part of the way with you."</p>
    <p>"I am in a hurry because I have Annémie's patterns to do," said Bébée, glad that he spoke of
     a thing that she knew how to answer. "You see, Annémie's hand shakes and her eyes are dim, and
     she pricks the pattern all awry and never perceives it; it would break her heart if one showed
     her so, but the Baës would not take them as they are; they are of no use at all. So I prick
     them out myself on fresh paper, and the Baës thinks it is all her doing, and pays her the same
     money, and she is quite content. And as I carry the patterns to and fro for her, because she
     cannot walk, it is easy to cheat her like that; and it is no harm to cheat <emph>so</emph>, you
     know." He was silent.</p>
    <p>"You are a good little girl, Bébée, I can see." he said at last, with a graver sound in his
     voice. "And who is this Annémie for whom you do so much? an old woman, I suppose."</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, quite old; incredibly old. Her man was drowned at sea sixty years ago, and she
     watches for his brig still, night and morning."</p>
    <p>"The dog's heart. No doubt he beat her, and had a wife in fifty other ports."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no!" said Bébée, with a little cry, as though the word against the dead man hurt her.
     "She has told me so much of him. He was as good as good could be, and loved her so, and between
     the voyages they were so happy. Surely that must have been sixty years now, and she is so sorry
     still, and still will not believe that he was drowned."</p>
    <p>He looked down on her with a smile that had a certain pity in it.</p>
    <p>"Well, yes; there are women like that, I believe. But be very sure, my dear, he beat her. Of
     the two, one always holds the whip and uses it, the other crouches."</p>
    <p>"I do not understand," said Bébée.</p>
    <p>"No; but you will."</p>
    <p>"I will? — when?"</p>
    <p>He smiled again.</p>
    <p>"Oh — to-morrow, perhaps, or next year — or when Fate fancies."</p>
    <p>"Or rather, when I choose," he thought to himself, and let his eyes rest with a certain
     pleasure on the little feet, that went beside him in the grass, and the pretty fair bosom that
     showed ever and again, as the frills of her linen bodice were blown back by the wind and her
     own quick motion.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked also up at him; he was very handsome, and looked so to her, after the broad,
     blunt, characterless faces of the Walloon peasantry around her. He walked with an easy grace,
     he was clad in picture-like velvets, he had a beautiful poetic head, and eyes like deep brown
     waters, and a face like one of Jordaens' or Rembrandt's cavaliers in the galleries where she
     used to steal in of a Sunday, and look up at the paintings, and dream of what that world could
     be in which those people had lived.</p>
    <p>"<emph>You</emph> are of the people of Rubes' country, are you not?" she asked him.</p>
    <p>"Of what country, my dear?"</p>
    <p>"Of the people that live in the gold frames," said Bébée, quite seriously. "In the galleries,
     you know. I know a charwoman that scrubs the floors of the Arenberg Palace, and she lets me in
     sometimes to look; and you are just like those great gentlemen in the gold frames, only you
     have not a hawk and a sword, and they always have. I used to wonder where they came from, for
     they are not like any of us one bit, and the charwoman — she is Lisa Dredel, and lives in the
     street of the Pot d'Etain — always said. 'Dear heart, they all belong to Rubes' land: we never
     see their like nowadays.' But <emph>you</emph> must come out of Rubes' land; at least, I think so,
     do you not?"</p>
    <p>He caught her meaning; he knew that Rubes was the homely abbreviation of Rubens that all the
     Netherlanders used, and he guessed the idea that was reality to this little lonely fanciful
     mind.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I do," he answered her with a smile, for it was not worth his while to disabuse her
     thoughts of any imagination that glorified him to her. "Do you not want to see Rubes' world,
     little one? To see the gold and the grandeur, and the glitter of it all? — never to toil or get
     tired? — always to move in a pageant? — always to live like the hawks in the paintings you talk of,
     with silver bells hung round you, and a hood all sewn with pearls?"</p>
    <p>"No," said Bébée, simply. "I should like to see it, just to see it, as one looks through a
     grating into the king's grape-houses here. But I should not like to live in it. I love my hut,
     and the starling, and the chickens, and what would the garden do without me? and the children,
     and the old Annémie? I could not anyhow, anywhere, be any happier than I am. There is only one
     thing I wish."</p>
    <p>"And what is that?"</p>
    <p>"To know something; not to be so ignorant. Just look — I can read a Little, it is true: my
     Hours, and the letters, and when Krebs brings in a newspaper I can read a little of it, not
     much. I know French well, because Antoine was French himself, and never did talk Flemish to me;
     and they being Netherlanders, cannot, of course, read the newspapers at all, and so think it
     very wonderful indeed in me. But what I want is to know things, to know all about what
      <emph>was</emph> before ever I was living. St. Gudule now — they say it was built hundreds of years
     before; and Rubes again — they say he was a painter king in Antwerpen before the oldest, oldest
     woman like Annémie ever began to count time. I am sure books tell you all those things, because
     I see the students coming and going with them; and when I saw once the millions of books in the
     Rue du Musée, I asked the keeper what use they were for, and he said, 'To make men wise, my
     dear.' But Gringoire Bac, the cobbler, who was with me, — it was a fête day, — Bac, <emph>he</emph>
     said, 'Do not you believe that, Bébée; they only muddle folks' brains; for one book tells them
     one thing, and another book another, and so on, till they are dazed with all the contrary
     lying; and if you see a bookish man, be sure you see a very poor creature who could not hoe a
     patch, or kill a pig, or stitch an upper-leather, were it ever so.' But I do not believe that
     Bac said right. Did he?"</p>
    <p>"I am not sure. On the whole, I think it is the truest remark on literature I have ever
     heard, and one that shows great judgment in Bac. Well?"</p>
    <p>"Well, sometimes, you know," said Bébée, not understanding his answer, but pursuing her
     thoughts confidentially, — "sometimes I talk like this to the neighbors, and they laugh at me.
     Because Mère Krebs says that when one knows how to spin and sweep and make bread and say one's
     prayers and milk a goat or a cow, it is all a woman wants to know this side of heaven. But for
     me, I cannot help it, when I look at those windows in the cathedral, or at those beautiful
     twisted little spires that are all over our Hôtel de Ville, I want to know who the men were
     that made them, — what they did and thought, — how they looked and spoke, — how they learned to shape
     stone into leaves and grasses like that, — how they could imagine all those angel faces on the
     glass. When I go alone in the quite early morning or at night when it is still — sometimes in
     winter I have to stay till it is dark over the lace — I hear their feet come after me, and they
     whisper to me close, 'Look what beautiful things we have done, Bébée, and you all forget us
     quite. We did what never will die, but our names are as dead as the stones.' And then I am so
     sorry for them and ashamed. And I want to know more. Can you tell me?"</p>
    <p>He looked at her earnestly; her eyes were shining, her cheeks were warm, her little mouth was
     tremulous with eagerness.</p>
    <p>"Did any one ever speak to you in that way?" he asked her.</p>
    <p>"No," she answered him. "It comes into my head of itself. Sometimes I think the cathedral
     angels put it there. For the angels must be tired, you know; always pointing to God and always
     seeing men turn away, I used to tell Antoine sometimes. But he used to shake his head and say
     that it was no use thinking; most likely St. Gudule and St. Michael had set the church down in
     the night all ready made, why not? God made the trees, and they were more wonderful, he
     thought, for his part. And so perhaps they are, but that is no answer. And I do <emph>want</emph>
     to know. I want some one who will tell me; and if you come out of Rubes' country as I think, no
     doubt you know everything, or remember it?"</p>
    <p>He smiled.</p>
    <p>"The free pass to Rubes' country lies in books, pretty one. Shall I give you some? — nay, lend
     them, I mean, since giving you are too wilful to hear of without offence. You can read, you
     said?"</p>
    <p>Bébée's eyes glowed as they lifted themselves to his.</p>
    <p>"I can read — not very fast, but that would come with doing it more and more, I think, just as
     spinning does; one knots the thread and breaks it a million times before one learns to spin as
     fine as cobwebs. I have read the stories of St. Anne, and of St. Catherine, and of St. Luven
     fifty times, but they are all the books that Father Francis has; and no one else has any among
     us."</p>
    <p>"Very well. You shall have books of mine. Easy ones first, and then those that are more
     serious. But what time will you have? You do so much; you are like a little golden bee."</p>
    <p>Bébée laughed happily.</p>
    <p>"Oh! give me the books and I will find the time. It is light so early now. That gives one so
     many hours. In winter one has so few one must lie in bed, because to buy a candle you know one
     cannot afford except, of course, a taper now and then, as one's duty is, for our Lady or for
     the dead. And will you really, really, lend me books?"</p>
    <p>"Really, I will. Yes. I will bring you one to the Grande Place to-morrow, or meet you on your
     road there with it. Do you know what poetry is, Bébée?"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"But your flowers talk to you?"</p>
    <p>"Ah! always. But then no one else hears them ever but me; and so no one else ever
     believes."</p>
    <p>"Well, poets are folks who hear the flowers talk as you do, and the trees, and the seas, and
     the beasts, and even the stones; but no one else ever hears these things, and so, when the
     poets write them out, the rest of the world say, 'That is very fine, no doubt, but only good
     for dreamers; it will bake no bread.' I will give you some poetry; for I think you care more
     about dreams than about bread."</p>
    <p>"I do not know," said Bébée; and she did not know, for her dreams, like her youth, and her
     innocence, and her simplicity, and her strength, were all unconscious of themselves, as such
     things must be to be pure and true at all.</p>
    <p>Bébée had grown up straight, and clean, and fragrant, and joyous as one of her own
     carnations; but she knew herself no more than the carnation knows its color and its root,</p>
    <p>"No. you do not know," said he, with a sort of pity; and thought within himself, was it worth
     while to let her know?</p>
    <p>If she did not know, these vague aspirations and imaginations would drop off from her with
     the years of her early youth, as the lime-flowers drop downwards with the summer heats. She
     would forget them. They would linger a little in her head, and, perhaps, always wake at some
     sunset hour or some angelus chime, but not to trouble her. Only to make her cradle song a
     little sadder and softer than most women's was. Unfed, they would sink away and bear no
     blossom.</p>
    <p>She would grow into a simple, hardy, hardworking, God-fearing Flemish woman like the rest.
     She would marry, no doubt, some time, and rear her children honestly and well; and sit in the
     market stall every day, and spin and sew, and dig and wash, and sweep, and brave bad weather,
     and be content with poor food to the end of her harmless and laborious days — poor little
     Bébée!</p>
    <p>He saw her so clearly as she would be — if he let her alone.</p>
    <p>A little taller, a little broader, a little browner, less sweet of voice, less soft of skin,
     less flower-like in face; having learned to think only as her neighbors thought, of price of
     wood and cost of bread; laboring cheerily but hardly from daybreak to nightfall to fill hungry
     mouths: forgetting all things except the little curly-heads clustered round her soup-pot, and
     the year-old lips sucking at her breasts.</p>
    <p>A blameless life, an eventless life, a life as clear as the dewdrop, and as colorless; a life
     opening, passing, ending in the little green wooded lane, by the bit of water where the swans
     made their nests under the willows; a life like the life of millions, a little purer, a little
     brighter, a little more tender, perhaps, than those lives usually are, but otherwise as like
     them as one ear of barley is like another as it rises from the soil, and blows in the wind, and
     turns brown in the strong summer sun, and then goes down to the sod again under the sickle.</p>
    <p>He saw her just as she would be — if he let her alone.</p>
    <p>But should he leave her alone?</p>
    <p>He cared nothing; only her eyes had such a pretty, frank, innocent look like a bird's in
     them, and she had been so brave and bold with him about those silken stockings; and this little
     ignorant, dreamful mind of hers was so like a blush rosebud, which looks so close-shut, and so
     sweet-smelling, and so tempting fold within fold, that a child will pull it open, forgetful
     that he will spoil it forever from being a full-grown rose, and that he will let the dust, and
     the sun, and the bee into its tender bosom — and men are true children, and women are their
     rosebuds.</p>
    <p>Thinking only of keeping well with this strange and beautiful wayfarer from that unknown
     paradise of Rubes' country, Bébée lifted up the vine-leaves of her basket.</p>
    <p>"I took a flower for you to-day, but it is dead. Look; to-morrow, if you will be there, you
     shall have the best in all the garden."</p>
    <p>"You wish to see me again then?" he asked her. Bébée looked at him with troubled eyes, but
     with a sweet frank faith that had no hesitation in it.</p>
    <p>"Yes! you are not like anything I ever knew, and if you will only help me to learn a little.
     Sometimes I think I am not stupid, only ignorant; but I cannot be sure unless I try."</p>
    <p>He smiled; he was listlessly amused; the day before he had tempted the child merely because
     she was pretty, and to tempt her in that way seemed the natural course of things, but now there
     was something in her that touched him differently; the end would be the same, but he would
     change the means.</p>
    <p>The sun had set. There was a low, dull red glow still on the far edge of the plains — that was
     all. In the distant cottages little lights were twinkling. The path grew dark.</p>
    <p>"I will go away and let her alone," he thought. "Poor little soul! it would give itself
     lavishly, it would never be bought. I will let it alone; the mind will go to sleep and the body
     will keep healthy, and strong, and pure, as people call it. It would be a pity to play with
     both a day, and then throw them away as the boy threw the pear-blossom. She is a little clod of
     earth that has field flowers growing in it. I will let her alone, the flowers under the plough
     in due course will die, and she will be content among the other clods, — if I let her alone."</p>
    <p>At that moment there went across the dark fields, against the dusky red sky, a young man with
     a pile of brushwood on his back, and a hatchet in his hand.</p>
    <p>"You are late, Bébée," he called to her in Flemish, and scowled at the stranger by her
     side.</p>
    <p>"A good-looking lad; who is it?" said her companion.</p>
    <p>"That is Jeannot, the son of old Sophie," she answered him. "He is so good — oh, so good, you
     cannot think; he keeps his mother and three little sisters, and works so very, very hard in the
     forest, and yet he often finds time to dig my garden for me, and he chops all my wood in
     winter."</p>
    <p>They had come to where the road goes up by the king's summer palace. They were under great
     hanging beeches and limes. There was a high gray wall, and over it the blossoming fruit boughs
     hung. In a ditch full of long grass little kids bleated by their mothers. Away on the left went
     the green fields of colza, and beetroot, and trefoil, with big forest trees here and there in
     their midst, and, against the blue low line of the far horizon, red mill-sails, and gray church
     spires; dreamy plaintive bells far away somewhere were ringing the sad Flemish carillon.</p>
    <p>He paused and looked at her.</p>
    <p>"I must bid you good night, Bébée; you are near your home now."</p>
    <p>She paused too and looked at him.</p>
    <p>"But I shall see you to-morrow?"</p>
    <p>There was the wistful, eager, anxious unconsciousness of appeal as when the night before she
     had asked him if he were angry.</p>
    <p>He hesitated a moment. If he said no, and went away out of the city wherever his listless and
     changeful whim called him, he knew how it would be with her; he knew what her life would be as
     surely as he knew the peach would come out of the peach-flower rosy on the wall there: life in
     the little hut; among the neighbors; sleepy and safe and soulless; — if he let her alone.</p>
    <p>If he stayed and saw her on the morrow he knew, too, the end as surely as he knew that the
     branch of white pear-blossom, which in carelessness he had knocked down with a stone on the
     grass yonder, would fade in the night and would never bring forth its sweet, simple fruit in
     the sunshine.</p>
    <p>To leave the peach-flower to come to maturity and be plucked by a peasant, or to pull down
     the pear-blossom and rifle the buds?</p>
    <p>Carelessly and languidly he balanced the question with himself, whilst Bébée, forgetful of
     the lace patterns and the flight of the hours, stood looking at him with anxious and pleading
     eyes, thinking only — was he angry again, or would he really bring her the books and make her
     wise, and let her know the stories of the past?</p>
    <p>"Shall I see you to-morrow?" she said wistfully.</p>
    <p>Should she? — if he left the peach-blossom safe on the wall, Jeannot the woodcutter would come
     by and by and gather the fruit.</p>
    <p>If he left the clod of earth in its pasture with all its daisies untouched, this black-browed
     young peasant would cut it round with his hatchet and carry it to his wicker cage, that the
     homely brown lark of his love might sing to it some stupid wood note under a cottage eave.</p>
    <p>The sight of the strong young forester going over the darkened fields against the dull red
     skies was as a feather that suffices to sway to one side a balance that hangs on a hair.</p>
    <p>He had been inclined to leave her alone when he saw in his fancy the clean, simple, mindless,
     honest life that her fanciful girlhood would settle down into as time should go on. But when in
     the figure of the woodman there was painted visibly on the dusky sky that end for her which he
     had foreseen, he was not indifferent to it; he resented it; he was stirred to a vague desire to
     render it impossible.</p>
    <p>If Jeannot had not gone by across the fields he would have left her and let her alone from
     that night thenceforwards; as it was, — </p>
    <p>"Good night, Bébée," he said to her. "Tomorrow I will finish the Broodhuis and bring you your
     first book. Do not dream too much, or you will prick your lace patterns all awry. Good night,
     pretty one."</p>
    <p>Then he turned and went back through the green dim lanes to the city.</p>
    <p>Bébée stood a moment looking after him, with a happy smile; then she picked up the fallen
     pear-blossom, and ran home as fast as her feet would take her.</p>
    <p>That night she worked very late watering her flowers, and trimming them, and then ironing out
     a little clean white cap for the morrow; and then sitting down under the open lattice to prick
     out all old Annémie's designs by the strong light of the full moon that flooded her hut with
     its radiance.</p>
    <p>But she sang all the time she worked, and the gay, pretty, wordless songs floated across the
     water and across the fields, and woke some old people in their beds as they lay with their
     windows open, and they turned and crossed themselves, and said, "Dear heart! — this is the eve of
     the Ascension, and the angels are so near we hear them."</p>
    <p>But it was no angel; only the thing that is nearer heaven than anything else, — a little human
     heart that is happy and innocent.</p>
    <p>Bébée had only one sorrow that night. The pear-blossoms were all dead; and no care could call
     them back even for an hour's blooming.</p>
    <p>"He did not think when he struck them down," she said to herself, regretfully.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
    <p>"Can I do any work for you, Bébée?" said black Jeannot in the daybreak, pushing her gate open
     timidly with one hand.</p>
    <p>"There is none to do, Jeannot. They want so little in this time of the year — the flowers,"
     said she, lifting her head from the sweet-peas she was tying up to their sticks.</p>
    <p>The woodman did not answer; he leaned over the half-open wicket, and swayed it backwards and
     forwards under his bare arm. He was a good, harmless, gentle fellow, swarthy as charcoal and
     simple as a child, and quite ignorant, having spent all his days in the great Soignies forests
     making fagots when he was a little lad, and hewing down trees or burning charcoal as he grew to
     manhood.</p>
    <p>"Who was that seigneur with you last night, Bébée?" he asked, after a long silence, watching
     her as she moved.</p>
    <p>Bébée's eyes grew very soft, but they looked up frankly.</p>
    <p>"I am not sure — I think he is a painter — a great painter prince, I mean — as Rubes was in
     Antwerpen; he wanted roses the night before last in the cathedral."</p>
    <p>"But he was walking with you?"</p>
    <p>"He was in the lane as I came home last night — yes."</p>
    <p>"What does he give you for your roses?"</p>
    <p>"Oh! he pays me well. How is your mother this day, Jeannot?"</p>
    <p>"You do not like to talk of him?"</p>
    <p>"Why should you want to talk of him? He is nothing to you."</p>
    <p>"Did you really see him only two days ago, Bébée?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, Jeannot! did I ever tell a falsehood? You would not say that to one of your little
     sisters."</p>
    <p>The forester swayed the gate to and fro drearily under his folded arms.</p>
    <p>Bébée, not regarding him, cut her flowers, and filled her baskets, and did her other work,
     and set a ladder against the hut and climbed on its low roof to seek for eggs, the hens having
     green tastes sometimes for the rushes and lichens of its thatch. She found two eggs, which she
     promised herself to take to Annémie, and looking round as she sat on the edge of the roof, with
     one foot on the highest rung of the ladder, saw that Jeannot was still at the gate.</p>
    <p>"You will be late in the forest, Jeannot," she cried to him. "It is such a long, long way in
     and out. Why do you look so sulky? and you are kicking the wicket to pieces."</p>
    <p>"I do not like you to talk with strangers," said Jeannot, sullenly and sadly.</p>
    <p>Bébée laughed as she sat on the edge of the thatch, and looked at the shining gray skies of
     the early day, and the dew-wet garden, and the green fields beyond, with happy eyes that made
     the familiar scene transfigured to her.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Jeannot, what nonsense! As if I do not talk to a million strangers every summer! as if I
     could ever sell a flower if I did not! You are cross this morning; that is what it is."</p>
    <p>"Do you know the man's name?" said Jeannot, suddenly.</p>
    <p>Bébée felt her cheeks grow warm as with some noonday heat of sunshine. She thought it was
     with anger against blundering Jeannot's curiosity.</p>
    <p>"No! and what would his name be to us, if I did know it? I cannot ask people's names because
     they buy my roses."</p>
    <p>"As if it were only roses!"</p>
    <p>There was the length of the garden between them, and Bébée did not hear as she sat on the
     edge of her roof with that light dreamful enjoyment of air and sky and coolness, and all the
     beauty of the dawning day, which the sweet vague sense of a personal happiness will bring with
     it to the dullest and the coldest.</p>
    <p>"You are cross, Jeannot, that is what it is," she said, after a while. "You should not be
     cross; you are too big and strong and good. Go in and get my bowl of bread and milk for me, and
     hand it to me up here. It is so pleasant. It is as nice as being perched on an apple-tree."</p>
    <p>Jeannot went in obediently and handed up her breakfast to her, looking at her with shy,
     worshipping eyes. But his face was overcast, and he sighed heavily as he took up his hatchet
     and turned away; for he was the sole support of his mother and sisters, and if he did not do
     his work in Soignies they would starve at home.</p>
    <p>"You will be seeing that stranger again?" he asked her.</p>
    <p>"Yes!" she answered with a glad triumph in her eyes; not thinking at all of him as she spoke.
     "You ought to go, Jeannot, now; you are so late. I will come and see your mother to-morrow. And
     do not be cross, you dear big Jeannot. Days are too short to snip them up into little bits by
     bad temper; it is only a stupid sheep-shearer that spoils the fleece by snapping at it sharp
     and hard; that is what Father Francis says."</p>
    <p>Bébée, having delivered her little piece of wisdom, broke her bread into her milk and ate it,
     lifting her face to the fresh wind and tossing crumbs to the wheeling swallows, and watching
     the rose-bushes nod and toss below in the breeze, and thinking vaguely how happy a thing it was
     to live.</p>
    <p>Jeannot looked up at her, then went on his slow sad way through the wet lavender-shrubs and
     the opening buds of the lilies.</p>
    <p>"You will only think of that stranger, Bébée, never of any of us — never again," he said; and
     wearily opened the little gate and went through it, and down the daybreak stillness of the
     lane. It was a foolish thing to say; but when were lovers ever wise?</p>
    <p>Bébée did not heed; she did not understand herself or him; she only knew that she was happy;
     when one knows that, one does not want to seek much further.</p>
    <p>She sat on the thatch and took her bread and milk in the gray clear air, with the swallows
     circling above her head, and one or two of them even resting a second on the edge of the bowl
     to peck at the food from the big wooden spoon; they had known her all the sixteen summers of
     her life, and were her playfellows, only they would never tell her anything of what they saw in
     winter over the seas. That was her only quarrel with them. Swallows do not tell their secrets
     They have the weird of Procne on them all.</p>
    <p>The sun came and touched the lichens of the roof into gold.</p>
    <p>Bébée smiled at it gayly as it rose above the tops of the trees, and shone on all the little
     villages scattered over the plains.</p>
    <p>"Ah, dear Sun!" she cried to it. "I am going to be wise. I am going into great Rubes'
     country. I am going to hear of the Past and the Future. I am going to listen to what the Poets
     say. The swallows never would tell me anything; but now I shall know as much as they know. Are
     you not glad for me, O Sun?"</p>
    <p>The Sun came over the trees, and heard and said nothing. If he had answered at all he must
     have said, — </p>
    <p>"The only time when a human soul is either wise or happy is in that one single moment when
     the hour of my own shining or of the moon's beaming seems to that single soul to be past and
     present and future, to be at once the creation and the end of all things. Faust knew that; so
     will you."</p>
    <p>But the Sun shone on and held his peace. He sees all things ripen and fall. He can wait. He
     knows the end. It is always the same.</p>
    <p>He brings the fruit out of the peach-flower, and rounds it and touches it into ruddiest rose
     and softest gold: but the sun knows well that the peach must drop — whether into the basket to be
     eaten by kings, or on to the turf to be eaten by ants. What matter which very much after
     all?</p>
    <p>The Sun is not a cynic; he is only wise because he is Life and he is Death, the creator and
     the corrupter of all things.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
    <p>But Bébée, who only saw in the sun the sign of daily work, the brightness of the face of the
     world, the friend of the flowers, the harvest-man of the poor, the playmate of the birds and
     butterflies, the kindly light that the waking birds and the ringing carillon welcomed, — Bébée,
     who was not at all afraid of him, smiled at his rays and saw in them only fairest promise of a
     cloudless midsummer day as she gave her last crumb to the swallows, dropped down off the
     thatch, and busied herself in making bread that Mère Krebs would bake for her, until it was
     time to cut her flowers and go down into the town.</p>
    <p>When her loaves were made and she had run over with them to the mill-house and back again,
     she attired herself with more heed than usual, and ran to look at her own face in the mirror of
     the deep well-water — other glass she had none.</p>
    <p>She was used to hear herself called pretty; bat she had never thought about it at all till
     now. The people loved her; she had always believed that they had only said it as a sort of
     kindness, as they said, "God keep you." But now — </p>
    <p>"He told me I was like a flower," she thought to herself, and hung over the well to see. She
     did not know very well what he had meant; but the sentence stirred in her heart as a little
     bird under tremulous leaves.</p>
    <p>She waited ten minutes full, leaning and looking down, while her eyes, that were like the
     blue iris, smiled back to her from the brown depths below. Then she went and kneeled down
     before the old shrine in the wall of the garden.</p>
    <p>"Dear and holy Mother of Jesus, I do thank you that you made me a little good to look at,"
     she said, softly. "Keep me as you keep the flowers, and let my face be always fair, because it
     is a pleasure to <emph>be</emph> a pleasure. Ah, dear Mother, I say it so badly, and it sounds so
     vain, I know. But I do not think you will be angry, will you? And I am going to try to be
     wise."</p>
    <p>Then she murmured an ave or two, to be in form as it were, and then rose and ran along the
     lanes with her baskets, and brushed the dew lightly over her bare feet, and sang a little
     Flemish song for very joyousness, as the birds sing in the apple bough.</p>
    <p>She got the money for Annémie and took it to her with fresh patterns to prick, and the
     new-laid eggs.</p>
    <p>"I wonder what he meant by a dog's heart?" she thought to herself, as she left the old woman
     sitting by the hole in the roof pricking out the parchment in all faith that she earned her
     money, and looking every now and then through the forests of masts for the brig with the hank
     of flax flying, — the brig that had foundered fifty long years before in the northern seas, and
     in the days of her youth.</p>
    <p>"What is the dog's heart?" thought Bébée; she had seen a dog she knew — a dog which all his
     life long had dragged heavy loads under brutal stripes along the streets of Brussels — stretch
     himself on the grave of his taskmaster and refuse to eat, and persist in lying there until he
     died, though he had no memory except of stripes, and no tie to the dead except pain and sorrow.
     Was it a heart like this that he meant?</p>
    <p>"Was her sailor, indeed, so good to her?" she asked an old gossip of Annémie's, as she went
     down the stairs.</p>
    <p>The old soul stopped to think with difficulty of such a far-off time, and resting her brass
     flagon of milk on the steep step.</p>
    <p>"Eh, no; not that I ever saw," she answered at length. "He was fond of her — very fond; but he
     was a wilful one, and he beat her sometimes when he got tired of being on land. But women must
     not mind that, you know, my dear, if only a man's heart is right. Things fret them, and then
     they belabor what they love best; it is a way they have."</p>
    <p>"But she speaks of him as of an angel nearly!" said Bébée, bewildered.</p>
    <p>The old woman took up her flagon, with a smile flitting across her wintry face.</p>
    <p>"Ay, dear; when the frost kills your brave rose-bush, root and bud, do you think of the
     thorns that pricked you, or only of the fair, sweet-smelling things that flowered all your
     summer?"</p>
    <p>Bébée went away thoughtfully out of the old crazy water-washed house by the quay; life seemed
     growing very strange and intricate and knotted about her, like the threads of lace that a bad
     fairy has entangled in the night.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
    <p>Her stranger from Rubes' land was a great man in a certain world. He had become great when
     young, which is perhaps a misfortune. It indisposes men to be great at their maturity. He was
     famous at twenty, by a picture hectic in color, perfect in drawing, that made Paris at his
     feet. He became more famous by verses, by plays, by political follies, and by social successes.
     He was faithful, however, to his first love in art. He was a great painter, and year by year
     proved afresh the cunning of his hand. Purists said his pictures had no soul in them. It was
     not wonderful if they had none. He always painted soulless vice; indeed, he saw very little
     else.</p>
    <p>One year he had some political trouble. He wrote a witty pamphlet that hurt where it was
     perilous to aim. He laughed and crossed the border, riding into the green Ardennes one sunny
     evening. He had a name of some power and sufficient wealth; he did not feel long exile.
     Meanwhile he told himself he would go and look at Scheffer's Gretchen.</p>
    <p>The King of Thule is better; but people talk most of the Gretchen. He had never seen
     either.</p>
    <p>He went in leisurely, travelling up the bright Meuse River, and across the monotony of the
     plains, then green with wheat a foot high, and musical with the many bells of the Easter
     kermesses in the quaint old-world villages.</p>
    <p>There was something so novel, so sleepy, so harmless, so mediaeval, in the Flemish life, that
     it soothed him. He had been swimming all his life in salt sea-fed rapids; this sluggish, dull,
     canal water, mirroring between its rushes a life that had scarcely changed for centuries, had a
     charm for him.</p>
    <p>He stayed awhile in Antwerpen. The town is ugly and beautiful; it is like a dull quaint grés
     de Flandre jug, that has precious stones set inside its rim. It is a burgher ledger of bales
     and barrels, of sale and barter, of loss and gain; but in the heart of it there are illuminated
     leaves of missal vellum, all gold and color, and monkish story and heroic ballad, that could
     only have been executed in the days when Art was a religion.</p>
    <p>He gazed himself into an homage of Rubens, whom before he had slighted, never having known
     (for, unless you have seen Antwerp, it is as absurd to say that you have seen Rubens, as it is
     to think that you have seen Murillo out of Seville, or Raffaelle out of Rome); and he studied
     the Gretchen carefully, delicately, sympathetically, for he loved Scheffer; but though he
     tried, he failed to care for her.</p>
    <p>"She is only a peasant; she is not a poem," he said to himself; "I will paint a Gretchen for
     the Salon of next year."</p>
    <p>But it was hard for him to portray a Gretchen. All his pictures were Phryne, — Phryne in
     triumph, in ruin, in a palace, in a poor-house, on a bed of roses, on a hospital mattress;
     Phryne laughing with a belt of jewels about her supple waist; Phryne lying with the stones of
     the dead-house under her naked limbs, — but always Phryne. Phryne, who living had death in her
     smile; Phryne, who lifeless had blank despair on her face; Phryne, a thing that lived furiously
     every second of her days, but Phryne a thing that once being dead was carrion that never could
     live again.</p>
    <p>Phryne has many painters in this school, as many as Catherine and Cecilia had in the schools
     of the Renaissance, and he was chief amidst them.</p>
    <p>How could he paint Gretchen if the pure Scheffer missed? Not even if, like the artist monks
     of old, he steeped his brushes all Lent through in holy water.</p>
    <p>And in holy water he did not believe.</p>
    <p>One evening, having left Antwerpen ringing its innumerable bells over the grave of its dead
     Art, he leaned out of the casement of an absent friend's old palace in the Brabant street that
     is named after Mary of Burgundy; an old casement crusted with quaint carvings, and gilded round
     in Spanish fashion, with many gargoyles and griffins, and illegible scutcheons.</p>
    <p>Leaning there, wondering with himself whether he would wait awhile and paint quietly in this
     dim street, haunted with the shades of Memling and Maes, and Otto Veneris and Philip de
     Champagne, or whether he would go into the East and seek new types, and lie under the red
     Egyptian heavens and create a true Cleopatra, which no man has ever done yet, — young Cleopatra,
     ankle-deep in roses and fresh from Cæsar's kisses, — leaning there, he saw a little peasant go by
     below, with two little white feet in two wooden shoes, and a face that had the pure and simple
     radiance of a flower.</p>
    <p>"There is my Gretchen," he thought to himself, and went down and followed her into the
     cathedral. If he could get what was in her face, he would get what Scheffer could not.</p>
    <p>A little later walking by her in the green lanes, he meditated, "It is the face of Gretchen,
     but not the soul — the Red Mouse has never passed this child's lips. Nevertheless — "</p>
    <p>"Nevertheless — " he said to himself, and smiled.</p>
    <p>For he, the painter all his life long of Phryne living and of Phryne dead, believed that
     every daughter of Eve either vomits the Red Mouse or swallows it.</p>
    <p>It makes so little difference which, — either way the Red Mouse has been there the evening
     towards this little rush-covered hut, he forgot the Red Mouse, and began vaguely to see that
     there are creatures of his mother's sex from whom the beast of the Brocken slinks away.</p>
    <p>But he still said to himself, "Nevertheless." "Nevertheless," — for he knew well that when the
     steel cuts the silk, when the hound hunts the fawn, when the snake wooes the bird, when the
     king covets the vineyard, there is only one end possible at any time. It is the strong against
     the weak, the fierce against the feeble, the subtle against the simple, the master against the
     slave; there is no equality in the contest and no justice — it is merely inevitable, and the
     issue of it is written.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
    <p>The next day she had her promised book hidden under the vine-leaves of her empty basket as
     she went homeward, and though she had not seen him very long or spoken to him very much, she
     was happy.</p>
    <p>The golden gates of knowledge had just opened to her; she saw a faint, far-off glimpse of the
     Hesperides gardens within; of the dragon she had never heard, and had no fear.</p>
    <p>"Might I know your name?" she had asked him wistfully, as she had given him the rosebud, and
     taken the volume in return that day.</p>
    <p>"They call me Flamen."</p>
    <p>"It is your name?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, for the world. You must call me Victor, as other women do. Why do you want my
     name?"</p>
    <p>"Jeannot asked it of me."</p>
    <p>"Oh, Jeannot asked it, did he?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; besides," said Bébée, with her eyes very soft and very serious, and her happy voice
     hushed, — "besides, I want to pray for you of course, every day; and if I do not know your name,
     how can I make Our Lady rightly understand? The flowers know you without a name, but she might
     not, because so very many are always beseeching her, and you see she has all the world to look
     after."</p>
    <p>He had looked at her with a curious look, and had bade her farewell, and let her go home
     alone that night.</p>
    <p>Her work was quickly done, and by the light of the moon she spread her book on her lap in the
     porch of the hut and began her new delight.</p>
    <p>The children had come and pulled at her skirts and begged her to play. But Bébée had shaken
     her head.</p>
    <p>"I am going to learn to be very wise, dear," she told them; "I shall not have time to dance
     or to play."</p>
    <p>"But people are not merry when they are wise, Bébée," said Franz, the biggest boy.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps not," said Bébée: "but one cannot be everything, you know, Franz."</p>
    <p>"But surely, you would rather be merry than anything else?"</p>
    <p>"I think there is something better, Franz. I am not sure; I want to find out; I will tell you
     when I know."</p>
    <p>"Who has put that into your head, Bébée?"</p>
    <p>"The angels in the cathedral," she told them; and the children were awed and left her, and
     went away to play blind-man's-buff by themselves, on the grass by the swan's water.</p>
    <p>"But for all that the angels have said it," said Franz to his sisters, "I cannot see what
     good it will be to her to be wise, if she will not care any longer afterwards for almond
     gingerbread and currant cake."</p>
    <p>It was the little tale of "Paul and Virginia" that he had given her to begin her studies
     with: but it was a grand copy, full of beautiful drawings nearly at every page.</p>
    <p>It was hard work for her to read at first, but the drawings enticed and helped her, and she
     soon sank breathlessly into the charm of the story. Many words she did not know; many passages
     were beyond her comprehension; she was absolutely ignorant, and had nothing but the force of
     her own fancy to aid her.</p>
    <p>But though stumbling at every step, as a lame child through a flowery hillside in summer, she
     was happy as the child would be, because of the sweet, strange air that was blowing about her,
     and the blossoms that she could gather into her hand, so rare, so wonderful, and yet withal so
     familiar, because they <emph>were</emph> blossoms.</p>
    <p>With her fingers buried in her curls, with her book on her knee, with the moon rays white and
     strong on the page, Bébée sat entranced as the hours went by; the children's play shouts died
     away; the babble of the gossip at the house doors ceased; people went by and called good night
     to her; the little huts shut up one by one, like the white and purple convolvulus cups in the
     hedges.</p>
    <p>Bébée did not stir, nor did she hear them; she was deaf even to the singing of the
     nightingales in the willows, where she sat in her little thatch above, and the wet garden-ways
     beyond her.</p>
    <p>A heavy step came tramping down the lane. A voice called to her, — </p>
    <p>"What are you doing, Bébée, there, this time of the night? It is on the strike of
     twelve."</p>
    <p>She started as if she were doing some evil thing, and stretched her arms out, and looked
     around with blinded, wondering eyes, as if she had been rudely wakened from her sleep.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing up so late?" asked Jeannot; he was coming from the forest in the dead of
     night to bring food for his family; he lost his sleep thus often, but he never thought that he
     did anything except his duty in those long, dark, tiring tramps to and fro between Soignies and
     Laeken.</p>
    <p>Bébée shut her book and smiled with dreaming eyes, that saw him not at all.</p>
    <p>"I was reading — and, Jeannot, his name is Flamen for the world, but I may call him
     Victor."</p>
    <p>"What do I care for his name?"</p>
    <p>"You asked it this morning."</p>
    <p>"More fool I. Why do you read? Reading is not for poor folk like you and me."</p>
    <p>Bébée smiled up at the white clear moon that sailed above the woods.</p>
    <p>She was not awake out of her dream. She only dimly heard the words he spoke.</p>
    <p>"You are a little peasant," said Jeannot roughly, as he paused at the gate. "It is all you
     can do to get your bread. You have no one to stand between you and hunger. How will it be with
     you when the slug gets your roses, and the snail your carnations, and your hens die of damp,
     and your lace is all wove awry, because your head runs on reading and folly, and you are spoilt
     for all simple pleasures and for all honest work?"</p>
    <p>She smiled, still looking up at the moon, with the dropping ivy touching her hair.</p>
    <p>"You are cross, dear Jeannot. Good night."</p>
    <p>A moment afterwards the little rickety door was shut, and the rusty bolt drawn within it;
     Jeannot stood in the cool summer night all alone, and knew how stupid he had been in his
     wrath.</p>
    <p>He leaned on the gate a minute; then crossed the garden as softly as his wooden shoes would
     let him. He tapped gently on the shutter of the lattice.</p>
    <p>"Bébée — Bébée — just listen. I spoke roughly, dear — I know I have no right. I am sorry. Will you
     be friends with me again? — do be friends again."</p>
    <p>She opened the shutter a little way, so that he could see her pretty mouth speaking, "we are
     friends — we will always be friends, of course — only you do not know. Good night."</p>
    <p>He went away with a heavy heart and a long-drawn step. He would have preferred that she
     should have been angry with him.</p>
    <p>Bébée, left alone, let the clothes drop off her pretty round shoulders and her rosy limbs,
     and shook out her coils of hair, and kissed the book, and laid it under her head, and went to
     sleep with a smile on her face.</p>
    <p>Only, as she slept, her ringers moved as if she were counting her beads, and her lips
     murmured, — </p>
    <p>"Oh, dear Holy Mother, you have so much to think of — yes. I know — all the poor, and all the
     little children. But take care of <emph>him</emph>; he is called Flamen, and he lives in the street
     of Mary of Burgundy; you cannot miss him; and if you will look for him always, and have a heed
     that the angels never leave him, I will give you my great cactus glower — my only one — on your
     Feast of Roses this very year. Oh, dear Mother, you will not forget!"</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
    <p>Bébée was a dreamer in her way, and aspired to be a scholar too. But all the same, she was
     not a little fool.</p>
    <p>She had been reared in hardy, simple, honest ways of living, and would have thought it as
     shameful as a theft to have owed her bread to other folk.</p>
    <p>So, though she had a wakeful, restless night, full of strange fantasies, none the less was
     she out in her garden by daybreak; none the less did she sweep out her floor and make her mash
     for the fowls, and wash out her bit of linen and hang it to dry on a line among the tall,
     flaunting hollyhocks that were so proud of themselves because they reached to the roof.</p>
    <p>"What do you want with books, Bébée?" said Reine, the sabot-maker's wife, across the privet
     hedge, as she also hung out her linen. "Franz told me you were reading last night. It is the
     silver buckles have done that: one mischief always begets another."</p>
    <p>"Where is the mischief, good Reine?" said Bébée, who was always prettily behaved with her
     elders, though, when pushed to it, she could hold her own.</p>
    <p>"The mischief will be in discontent," said the sabot-maker's wife. "People live on their own
     little patch, and think it is the world; that is as it should be — everybody within his own, like
     a nut in its shell. But when you get reading, you hear of a swarm of things you never saw, and
     you fret because you cannot see them, and you dream, and dream, and a hole is burnt in your
     soup-pot, and your dough is as heavy as lead. You are like bees that leave their own clover
     fields to buzz themselves dead against the glass of a hothouse."</p>
    <p>Bébée smiled, reaching to spread out her linen. But she said nothing.</p>
    <p>"What good is it talking to them?" she thought; "they do not know."</p>
    <p>Already the neighbors and friends of her infancy seemed so far, far away; creatures of a
     distant world, that she had long left; it was no use talking, they never would understand.</p>
    <p>"Antoine should never have taught you your letters," said Reine, groaning under the great
     blue shirts she was hanging on high among the leaves. "I told him so at the time. I said, 'The
     child is a good child, and spins, and sews, and sweeps, rare and fine for her age; why go and
     spoil her?' But he was always headstrong. Not a child of mine knows a letter, the saints be
     praised! nor a word of any tongue but our own good Flemish. You should have been brought up the
     same. You would have come to no trouble then."</p>
    <p>"I am in no trouble, dear Reine," said Bébée, scattering the potato-peels to the clacking
     poultry, and she smiled into the faces of the golden oxlips that nodded to her back again in
     sunshiny sympathy.</p>
    <p>"Not yet," said Reine, hanging her last shirt.</p>
    <p>But Bébée was not hearing; she was calling the chickens, and telling the oxlips how pretty
     they looked in the borders; and in her heart she was counting the minutes till the old Dutch
     cuckoo-clock at Mère Krebs's — the only clock in the lane — should crow out the hour at which she
     went down to the city.</p>
    <p>She loved the hut, the birds, the flowers; but they were little to her now compared with the
     dark golden picturesque square, the changing crowds, the frowning roofs, the gray stones, and
     colors and shadows of the throngs for one face and for one smile.</p>
    <p>"He is sure to be there," she thought, and started half an hour earlier than was her wont.
     She wanted to tell him all her rapture in the book; no one else could understand.</p>
    <p>But all the day through he never came.</p>
    <p>Bébée sat with a sick heart and a parched little throat, selling her flowers and straining
     her eyes through the tumult of the square.</p>
    <p>The whole day went by, and there was no sign of him.</p>
    <p>The flowers had sold well: it was a feast day; her pouch was full of pence — what was that to
     her?</p>
    <p>She went and prayed in the cathedral, but it seemed cold, and desolate, and empty; even the
     storied windows seemed dark.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps he is gore out of the city," she thought; and a terror fell on her that frightened
     her, it was so unlike any fear that she had ever known — even the fear when she had seen death on
     old Antoine's face had been nothing like this.</p>
    <p>Going home through the streets, she passed the café of the Trois Frères that looks out on the
     trees of the park, and that has flowers in its balconies, and pleasant windows that stand open
     to let the sounds of the soldiers' music enter. She saw him in one of the windows. There were
     amber and scarlet and black; silks and satins and velvets. There was a fan painted and
     jewelled. There were women's faces. There was a heap of purple fruit and glittering sweetmeats.
     He laughed there. His beautiful Murillo head was dark against the white and gold within.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked up, — paused a second, — then went onward, with a thorn in her heart.</p>
    <p>He Had not seen her.</p>
    <p>"It is natural, of course — he has his world — he does not think often of me — there is no reason
     why he should be as good as he is," she said to herself as she went slowly over the stones.</p>
    <p>She had the dog's soul — only she did not know it.</p>
    <p>But the tears Fell down her cheeks, as she walked.</p>
    <p>It looked so bright in there, so gay, with the sound of the music coming in through the
     trees, and those women, — she had seen such women before; sometimes in the winter nights, going
     home from the lacework, she had stopped at the doors of the palaces, or of the opera house,
     when the carriages were setting down their brilliant burdens; and sometimes on the great feast
     days she had seen the people of the court going out to some gala at the theatre, or some great
     review of troops, or some ceremonial of foreign sovereigns; but she had never thought about
     them before; she had never wondered whether velvet was better to wear than woollen serge,
     or-diamonds lighter on the head than a little cap of linen.</p>
    <p>But now — </p>
    <p>Those women seemed to her so dazzling, so wondrously, so superhumanly beautiful; they seemed
     like some of those new dahlia flowers, rose and purple and gold, that outblazed the sun on the
     south border of her little garden, and blanched all the soft color out of the homely roses, and
     pimpernels, and sweet-williams, and double-stocks, that had bloomed there ever since the days
     of Waterloo.</p>
    <p>But the dahlias had no scent; and Bébée wondered if these women had any heart in them, — they
     looked all laughter, and glitter, and vanity. To the child, whose dreams of womanhood were
     evolved from the face of the Mary of the Assumption, of the Susannah of Mieris, and of that
     Angel in the blue coif whose face has a light as of the sun, — to her who had dreamed her way
     into vague perceptions of her own sex's maidenhood and maternity by help of those great
     pictures which had been before her sight from infancy, there was some taint, some artifice,
     some want, some harshness in these jewelled women; she could not have reasoned about it, but
     she felt it, as she felt that the grand dahlias missed a flower's divinity, being
     scentless.</p>
    <p>She was a little bit of wild thyme herself; hardy, fragrant, clean, tender, flowering by the
     wayside, full of honey, though only nourished on the turf and the stones, these gaudy,
     brilliant, ruby-bright, scarlet-mantled dahlias hurt her with a dim sense of pain and
     shame.</p>
    <p>Fasting, next day at sunrise she confessed to Father Francis: — </p>
    <p>"I saw beautiful rich women, and I envied them; and I could not pray to Mary last night for
     thinking of them, for I hated them so much."</p>
    <p>But she did not say, — </p>
    <p>"I hated them because they were with him."</p>
    <p>Out of the purest little soul, Love entering drives forth Candor.</p>
    <p>"That is not like you at all, Bébée," said the good old man, as she knelt at his feet on the
     bricks of his little bare study, where all the books he ever spelt out were treatises on the
     art of bee-keeping.</p>
    <p>"My dear, you never were covetous at all, nor did you ever seem to care for the things of the
     world. I wish Jehan had not given you those silver buckles; I think they have set your little
     soul on vanities."</p>
    <p>"It is not the buckles; I am not covetous," said Bébée; and then her face grew warm. She did
     not know why. and she did not hear the rest of Father Francis's admonitions.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
    <p>But the next noon-time brought him to the market stall, and the next also, and so the summer
     days slipped away, and Bébée was quite happy if she saw him in the morning time, to give him a
     fresh rose, or at evening by the gates, or under the beech-trees, when he brought her a new
     book, and sauntered awhile up the green lane beside her.</p>
    <p>An innocent, unconscious love like Bébée's wants so little food to make it all content. Such
     mere trifles are beautiful and sweet to it. Such slender stray gleams of light suffice to make
     a broad, bright golden noon of perfect joy around it.</p>
    <p>All the delirium, and fever, and desire, and despair, that are in maturer passion, are far
     away from it: far as is the flash of the meteor across sultry skies from the blue forget-me-not
     down in the brown meadow brook.</p>
    <p>It was very wonderful to Bébée that he, this stranger from Rubes' fairyland, could come at
     all to keep pace with her little clattering wooden shoes over the dust and the grass in the dim
     twilight time. The days went by in a trance of sweet amaze, and she kept count of the hours no
     more by the cuckoo-clock of the mill-house, or the deep chimes of the Brussels belfries; but
     only by such moments as brought her a word from his lips, or even a glimpse of him from afar,
     across the crowded square.</p>
    <p>She sat up half the nights reading the books he gave her, studying the long cruel
     polysyllables, and spelling slowly through the phrases that seemed to her so cramped and
     tangled, and which yet were a pleasure to unravel forsake of the thought they held.</p>
    <p>For Bébée, ignorant little simple soul that she was, had a mind in her that was eager,
     observant, quick to acquire, skilful to retain; and it would happen in certain times that
     Flamen, speaking to her of the things which he gave to her to read, would think to himself that
     this child had more wisdom than was often to be found in schools.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile he pondered various studies in various stages of a Gretchen, and made love to
     Bébée — made love at least by his eyes and by his voice, not hurrying his pleasant task, but
     hovering about her softly, and mindful not to scare her, as a man will gently lower his hand
     over a poised butterfly that he seeks to kill, and which one single movement, a thought too
     quick, may scare away to safety.</p>
    <p>Bébée knew where he lived in the street of Mary of Burgundy: in an old palace that belonged
     to a great Flemish noble, who never dwelt there himself; but to ask anything about him — why he
     was there? what his rank was? why he stayed in the city at all? — was a sort of treason that
     never entered her thoughts.</p>
    <p>Psyche, if she had been as simple and loyal as Bébée was, would never have lighted her own
     candle; but even Psyche would not have borrowed any one else's lamp to lighten the love
     darkness.</p>
    <p>To Bébée he was sacred, unapproachable, unquestionable; he was a wonderful, perfect happiness
     that had fallen into her life; he was a gift of God, as the sun was.</p>
    <p>She took his going and coming as she took that of the sun, never dreaming of reproaching his
     absence, never dreaming of asking if in the empty night he shone on any other worlds than
     hers.</p>
    <p>It was hardly so much a faith with her as an instinct; faith must reason ere it know itself
     to be faith. Bébée never reasoned any more than her roses did.</p>
    <p>The good folks in the market place watched her a little anxiously; they thought ill of that
     little moss-rose that every day found its way to one wearer only; but after all they did not
     see much, and the neighbors nothing at all. For he never went home to her, nor with her, and
     most of the time that he spent with Bébée was in the quiet evening shadows, as she went up with
     her empty basket through the deserted country roads.</p>
    <p>Bébée was all day long in the city, indeed, as other girls were, but with her it had always
     been different. Antoine had always been with her up to the day of his death; and after his
     death she had sat in the same place, surrounded by the people she had known from infancy, and
     an insult to her would have been answered by a stroke from the cobbler's strap or from the
     tinker's hammer. There was one girl only who ever tried to do her any harm — a good-looking stout
     wench, who stood at the corner of the Montagne de la Cour with a stall of fruit in the summer
     time, and in winter time drove a milk cart over the snow. This girl would get at her sometimes,
     and talk of the students, and tell her how good it was to get out of the town on a holiday, and
     go to any one of the villages where there was Kermesse and dance, and drink the little blue
     wine, and have trinkets bought for one, and come home in the moonlight in a char-à-banc, with
     the horns sounding, and the lads singing, and the ribbons flying from the old horse's ears.</p>
    <p>"She is such a little close sly thing!" thought the fruit girl, sulkily. To vice, innocence
     must always seem only a superior kind of chicanery.</p>
    <p>"We dance almost every evening, the children and I," Bébée had answered when urged fifty
     times by this girl to go to fairs, and balls at the wine shops. "That does just as well. And I
     have seen Kermesse once at Malines — it was beautiful. I went with Mère Dax, but it cost a great
     deal I know, though she did not let me pay."</p>
    <p>"You little fool!" the fruit girl would say, and grin, and eat a pear.</p>
    <p>But the good honest old women who sat about in the Grande Place, hearing, had always taken
     the fruit girl to task, when they got her by herself.</p>
    <p>"Leave the child alone, you mischievous one," said they. "Be content with being base
     yourself. Look you, Lisette; she is not one like you to make eyes at the law students, and
     pester the painter lads for a day's outing. Let her be, or we will tell your mother how you
     leave the fruit for the gutter children to pick and thieve, while you are stealing up the
     stairs into that young French fellow's chamber. Oh, oh! a fine beating you will get when she
     knows!"</p>
    <p>Lisette's mother was a fierce and strong old Brabantoise who exacted heavy reckoning with her
     daughter for every single plum and peach that she sent out of her dark sweet-smelling fruit
     shop to be sunned in the streets, and under the students' love-glances.</p>
    <p>So the girl took heed, and left Bébée alone.</p>
    <p>"What should I want her to come with us for?" she reasoned with herself. "She is twice as
     pretty as I am; Jules might take to her instead — who knows?"</p>
    <p>So that she was at once savage and yet triumphant when she saw, as she thought, Bébée
     drifting down the high flood of temptation.</p>
    <p>"Oh, oh, you dainty one!" she cried one day to her. "So you would not take the nuts and
     mulberries that do for us common folk, because you had a mind for a fine pine out of the
     hothouses! That was all, was it? Eh, well; I do not begrudge you. Only take care; remember, the
     nuts and mulberries last through summer and autumn, and there are heaps of them on every
     fair-stall and street corner; but the pine, that is eaten in a day, one springtime, and its
     like does not grow in the hedges. You will have your mouth full of sugar an hour, — and then,
     eh! — you will go famished all the year."</p>
    <p>"I do not understand," said Bébée, looking up, with her thoughts far away, and scarcely
     hearing the words spoken to her.</p>
    <p>"Oh, pretty little fool! you understand well enough," said Lisette, grinning, as she rubbed
     up a melon. "Does he give you fine things? You might let me see."</p>
    <p>"No one gives me anything."</p>
    <p>"Chut! you want me to believe that. Why Jules is only a lad, and his father is a silk mercer,
     and only gives him a hundred francs a month, but Jules buys me all I want — somehow — or do you
     think I would take the trouble to set my cap straight when he goes by? He gave me these
     ear-rings, look. I wish you would let me see what you get."</p>
    <p>But Bébée had gone away — unheeding — dreaming of Juliet and of Jeanne d'Arc, of whom he had told
     her tales.</p>
    <p>He made sketches of her sometimes, but seldom pleased himself.</p>
    <p>It was not so easy as he had imagined that it would prove to portray this little flower-like
     face, with the clear eyes and the child's open brow. He who had painted Phryne so long and
     faithfully had got a taint on his brush — he could not paint this pure, bright, rosy dawn — he who
     had always painted the glare of midnight gas on rouge or rags. Yet he felt that if he could
     transfer to canvas the light that was on Bébée's face he would get what Scheffer had missed.
     For a time it eluded him. You shall paint a gold and glistening brocade, or a fan of peacock's
     feathers, to perfection, and yet, perhaps, the dewy whiteness of the humble little field daisy
     shall baffle and escape you.</p>
    <p>He felt, too, that he must catch her expression flying as he would do the flash of a
     swallow's wing across a blue sky; he knew that Bébée, forced to studied attitudes in an
     atelier, would be no longer the ideal that he wanted.</p>
    <p>More than once he came and filled in more fully his various designs in the little hut garden,
     among the sweet gray lavender and the golden disks of the sunflowers; and more than once Bébée
     was missed from her place in the front of the Broodhuis.</p>
    <p>The Varnhart children would gather now and then open-mouthed at the wicket, and Mère Krebs
     would shake her head as she went by on her sheepskin saddle, and mutter that the child's head
     would be turned by vanity; and old Jehan would lean on his stick and peer through the
     sweetbrier, and wonder stupidly if this strange man who could make Bébée's face beam over again
     upon that panel of wood could not give him back his dead daughter who had been pushed away
     under the black earth so long, long before, when the red mill had been brave and new, the red
     mill that the boys and girls called old.</p>
    <p>But except these, no one noticed much.</p>
    <p>Painters were no rare sights in Brabant.</p>
    <p>The people were used to see them coming and going, making pictures of mud and stones, and
     ducks and sheep, and of all common and silly things.</p>
    <p>"What does he pay you, Bébée?" they used to ask, with the shrewd Flemish thought after the
     main chance.</p>
    <p>"Nothing," Bébée would answer, with a quick color in her face; and they would reply in
     contemptuous reproof, "Careless little fool; you should make enough to buy you wood all winter.
     When the man from Ghent painted Trine and her cow, he gave her a whole gold bit for standing
     still so long in the clover. The Krebs would be sure to lend you her cow, if it be the cow that
     makes the difference."</p>
    <p>Bébée was silent, weeding her carnation bed; — what could she tell them that they would
     understand?</p>
    <p>She seemed so far away from them all — those good friends of her childhood — now that this
     wonderful new world of his giving had opened to her sight.</p>
    <p>She lived in a dream.</p>
    <p>Whether she sat in the market place taking copper coins, or in the moonlight with a book on
     her knees, it was all the same. Her feet ran, her tongue spoke, her hands worked; she did not
     neglect her goat or her garden, she did not forsake her house labor or her good deeds to old
     Annémie; but all the while she only heard one voice, she only felt one touch, she only saw one
     face.</p>
    <p>Here and there — one in a million — there is a female thing that can love like this, once and
     forever.</p>
    <p>Such an one is dedicated, birth upwards, to the Mater Dolorosa.</p>
    <p>He had something nearer akin to affection for her than he had ever had in his life for
     anything, but he was never in love with her — no more in love with her than with the
     moss-rosebuds that she fastened in his breast. Yet he played with her, because she was such a
     little, soft, tempting female thing; and because, to see her face flush, and her heart heave,
     to feel her fresh feelings stir into life, and to watch her changes from shyness to confidence,
     and from frankness again into fear, was a natural pastime in the lazy golden weather.</p>
    <p>That he spared her as far as he did, — when after all she would have married Jeannot
     anyhow, — and that he sketched her face in the open air, and never entered her hut and never
     beguiled her to his own old palace in the city, was a new virtue in himself for which he hardly
     knew whether to feel respect or ridicule; anyway, it seemed virtue to him.</p>
    <p>So long as he did not seduce the body, it seemed to him that it could never matter how he
     slew the soul, — the little, honest, happy, pure, frank soul, that amidst its poverty and
     hardships was like a robin's song to the winter sun.</p>
    <p>"Hoot, toot, pretty innocent, so you are no better than the rest of us," hissed her enemy,
     Lisette, the fruit girl, against her as she went by the stall one evening as the sun set.
     "Prut! so it was no such purity after all that made you never look at the student lads and the
     soldiers, eh? You were so dainty of taste, you must needs pick and choose, and, Lord's sake,
     after all your coyness, to drop at a beckoning finger as one may say — pong! — in a minute, like an
     apple over-ripe! Oh hé, you sly one!"</p>
    <p>Bébée flushed red, in a sort of instinct of offence; not sure what her fault was, but vaguely
     stung by the brutal words.</p>
    <p>Bébée walked homeward by him, with her empty baskets: looked at him with grave wondering
     eyes.</p>
    <p>"What did she mean? I do not understand. I must have done some wrong — or she thinks so. Do you
     know?"</p>
    <p>Flamen laughed, and answered her evasively, — </p>
    <p>"You have done her the wrong of a fair skin when hers is brown, and a little foot while hers
     is as big as a trooper's; there is no greater sin, Bébée, possible in woman to woman."</p>
    <p>"Hold your peace, you shrill jade," he added, in anger to the fruiterer, flinging at her a
     crown piece, that the girl caught, and bit with her teeth with a chuckle. "Do not heed her,
     Bébée. She is a coarse-tongued brute, and is jealous, no doubt."</p>
    <p>"Jealous? — of what?"</p>
    <p>The word had no meaning to Bébée.</p>
    <p>"That I am not a student or a soldier, as her lovers are."</p>
    <p>As her lovers were! Bébée felt her face burn again. Was he her lover then? The child's
     innocent body and soul thrilled with a hot, sweet delight and fear commingled.</p>
    <p>Bébée was not quite satisfied until she had knelt down that night and asked the Master of all
     poor maidens to see if there were any wickedness in her heart, hidden there like a bee in a
     rose, and if there were to take it out and make her worthier of this wonderful new happiness in
     her life.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
    <p>The next day, waking with a radiant little soul as a bird in a forest wakes in summer Bébée
     was all alone in the lane by the swans' water. In the gray of the dawn all the good folk except
     herself and lame old Jehan had tramped off to a pilgrimage, Liége way, which the bishop of the
     city had enjoined on all the faithful as a sacred duty.</p>
    <p>Bébée doing her work, singing, thinking how good God was, and dreaming over a thousand
     fancies of the wonderful stories he had told her, and of the exquisite delight that would lie
     for her in watching for him all through the shining hours, Bébée felt her little heart leap
     like a squirrel as the voice that was the music of heaven to her called through the
     stillness, — "Good day, pretty one! you are as early as the lark, Bébée. I go to Mayence, so I
     thought I would look at you one moment as I pass."</p>
    <p>Bébée ran down through the wet grass in a tumult of joy. She had never seen him so early in
     the day — never so early as this, when nobody was up and stirring except birds and beasts and
     peasant folk.</p>
    <p>She did not know how pretty she looked herself; like a rain-washed wild rose; her feet
     gleaming with dew, her cheeks warm with health and joy; her sunny clustering hair free from the
     white cap and tumbling a little about her throat, because she had been stooping over the
     carnations.</p>
    <p>Flamen loosed the wicket latch, and thought there might be better ways of spending the day
     than in the gray shadows of old Mechlin.</p>
    <p>"Will you give me a draught of water?" he asked her as he crossed the garden.</p>
    <p>"I will give you breakfast," said Bébée, happy as a bird. She felt no shame for the smallness
     of her home; no confusion at the poverty of her little place; such embarrassments are born of
     self-consciousness, and Bébée had no more self-consciousness than her own sweet, gray
     lavender-bush blowing against the door.</p>
    <p>The lavender-bush has no splendor like the roses, has no colors like the hollyhocks; it is a
     simple, plain, gray thing that the bees love and that the cottagers cherish, and that keeps the
     moth from the homespun linen, and that goes with the dead to their graves.</p>
    <p>It has many virtues and infinite sweetness, but it does not know it or think of it; and if
     the village girls ever tell it so, it fancies they only praise it out of kindness as they put
     its slender fragrant spears away in their warm bosoms. Bébée was like her lavender, and now
     that this beautiful Purple Emperor butterfly came from the golden sunbeams to find pleasure for
     a second in her freshness, she was only very grateful, as the lavender-bush was to the village
     girls.</p>
    <p>"I will give you your breakfast," said Bébée, flushing rosily with pleasure, and putting away
     the ivy coils that he might enter.</p>
    <p>"I have very little, you know," she added, wistfully. "Only goat's milk and bread; but if
     that will do — and there is some honey — and if you would eat a salad, I would cut one fresh."</p>
    <p>He did enter, and glanced round him with a curious pity and wonder both in one.</p>
    <p>It was such a little, small, square place; and its floor was of beaten clay; and its unceiled
     roof he could have touched; and its absolute poverty was so plain, — and yet the child looked so
     happy in it, and was so like a flower, and was so dainty and fresh, and even so full of
     grace.</p>
    <p>She stood and looked at him with frank and grateful eyes; she could hardly believe that he
     was here; he, the stranger of Rubes' land, in her own little rush-covered home.</p>
    <p>But she was not embarrassed by it; she was glad and proud.</p>
    <p>There is a dignity of peasants as well as of kings, — the dignity that comes from all absence
     of effort, all freedom from pretence. Bébée had this, and she had more still than this: she had
     the absolute simplicity of childhood with her still.</p>
    <p>Some women have it still when they are four-score.</p>
    <p>She could have looked at him forever, she was so happy; she cared nothing now for those
     dazzling dahlias — he had left them; he was actually here — here in her own, little dear home, with
     the cocks looking in at the threshold, and the sweet-peas nodding at the lattice, and the
     starling crying, "Bonjour! Bonjour!"</p>
    <p>"You are tired, I am sure you must be tired," she said, pulling her little bed forward for
     him to sit on, for there were only two wooden stools in the hut, and no chair at all.</p>
    <p>Then she took his sketching-easel and brushes from his hand, and would have kneeled and taken
     the dust off his boots if he would have let her; and went hither and thither gladly and
     lightly, bringing him a wooden bowl of milk and the rest of the slender fare, and cutting as
     quick as thought fresh cresses and lettuce from her garden, and bringing him, as the crown of
     all, Father Francis's honey-comb on vine-leaves, with some pretty sprays of box and mignonette
     scattered about it — doing all this with a swift, sweet grace that robbed the labor of all look
     of servitude, and looking at him ever and again with a smile that said as clearly as any words,
     "I cannot do much, but what I do, I do with all my heart."</p>
    <p>There was something in the sight of her going and coming in those simple household errands,
     across the sunlit floor, that moved him as some mountain air sung on an alp by a girl driving
     her cows to pasture may move a listener who indifferent has heard the swell of the organ of La
     Hague, or the recitative of a great singer in San Carlo.</p>
    <p>The gray lavender blowing at the house door has its charm for those who are tired of the
     camellias that float in the porcelain bowls of midnight suppers.</p>
    <p>This man was not good. He was idle and vain, and amorous and cold, and had been spoiled by
     the world in which he had passed his days; but he had the temper of an artist: he had
     something, too, of a poet's fancy; he was vaguely touched and won by this simple soul that
     looked at him out of Bébée's eyes with some look that in all its simplicity had a divine gleam
     in it that made him half ashamed.</p>
    <p>He had known women by the thousand, good women and bad; women whom he had dealt ill with and
     women who had dealt ill with him; but this he had not known — this frank, fearless, tender, gay,
     grave, innocent, industrious little life, helping itself, feeding itself, defending itself,
     working for itself and for others, and vaguely seeking all the while some unseen light, some
     unknown god, with a blind faith so infinitely ignorant and yet so infinitely pathetic.</p>
    <p>"All the people are gone on a pilgrimage," she explained to him when he asked her why her
     village was so silent this bright morning. "They are gone to pray for a fine harvest, and that
     she wants herself as well — it costs seven francs apiece. They take their food with them; they go
     and laugh and eat in the fields. I think it is nonsense. One can say one's prayers just as well
     here. Mère Krebs thinks so too, but then she says, 'If I do not go, it will look ill; people
     will say I am irreligious; and as we make so much by flour, God would think it odd for me to be
     absent; and, besides, it is only seven francs there and back; and if it does please Heaven,
     that is cheap, you know. One will get it over and over again in Paradise.' That is what Mere
     Krebs says. But, for me, I think it is nonsense. It cannot please God to go by train and eat
     galette and waste a whole day in getting dusty.</p>
    <p>"When I give the Virgin my cactus flower, I do give up a thing I love, and I let it wither on
     her altar instead of pleasing me in bloom here all the week, and then, of course, she sees that
     I have done it out of gratitude. But that is different: that I am sorry to do, and yet I am
     glad to do it out of love. Do you not know?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I know very well. But is the Virgin all that you love like this?"</p>
    <p>"No; there is the garden, and there is Antoine — he is dead, I know. But I think that we should
     love the dead all the better, not the less, because they cannot speak or say that they are
     angry; and perhaps one pains them very much when one neglects them, and if they are ever so
     sad, they cannot rise and rebuke one — that is why I would rather forget the flowers for the
     Church than I would the flowers for his grave, because God can punish me, of course, if he
     like, but Antoine never can — any more — now."</p>
    <p>"You are logical in your sentiment, my dear," said Flamen, who was more moved than he cared
     to feel. "The union is a rare one in your sex. Who taught you to reason?"</p>
    <p>"No one. And I do not know what to be logical means. Is it that you laugh at me?"</p>
    <p>"No. I do not laugh. And your pilgrims — they are gone for all day?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. They are gone to the Sacred Heart at St. Marie en Bois. It is on the way to Liége. They
     will come back at nightfall. And some of them will be sure to have drunk too much, and the
     children will get so cross. Prosper Bar, who is a Calvinist, always says, 'Do not mix up prayer
     and play; you would not cut a gherkin in your honey'; but I do not know why he called prayer a
     gherkin, because it is sweet enough — sweeter than anything, I think. When I pray to the Virgin
     to let me see you next day, I go to bed quite happy, because she will do it, I know, if it will
     be good for me."</p>
    <p>"But if it were not good for you, Bébée? Would you cease to wish it then?"</p>
    <p>He rose as he spoke, and went across the floor and drew away her hand that was parting the
     flax, and took it in his own and stroked it, indulgently and carelessly, as a man may stroke
     the soft fur of a young cat.</p>
    <p>Leaning against the little lattice and looking down on her with musing eyes, half smiling,
     half serious, half amorous, half sad, Bébée looked up with a sudden and delicious terror that
     ran through her as the charm of the snake's gaze runs through the bewildered bird.</p>
    <p>"Would you cease to wish it if it were not good?" he asked again.</p>
    <p>Bébée's face grew pale and troubled. She left her hand in his because she did not think any
     shame of his taking it. But the question suddenly flung the perplexity and darkness of doubt
     into the clearness of her pure child's conscience. All her ways had been straight and sunlit
     before her.</p>
    <p>She had never had a divided duty.</p>
    <p>The religion and the pleasure of her simple little life had always gone hand-in-hand,
     greeting one another, and never for an instant in conflict. In any hesitation of her own she
     had always gone to Father Francis, and he had disentangled the web for her and made all
     plain.</p>
    <p>But here was a difficulty in which she could never go to Father Francis.</p>
    <p>Right and wrong, duty and desire, were for the first time arrayed before her in their ghastly
     and unending warfare.</p>
    <p>It frightened her with a certain breathless sense of peril — the peril of a time when in lieu
     of that gentle Mother of Roses whom she kneeled to among the flowers, she would only see a
     dusky shadow looming between her and the beauty of life and the light of the sun.</p>
    <p>What he said was quite vague to her. She attached no definite danger to his words. She only
     thought — to see him was so great a joy — if Mary forbade it, would she not take it if she could
     notwithstanding, always, always, always?</p>
    <p>He kept her hand in his, and watched with contentment the changing play of the shade and
     sorrow, the fear and fascination, on her face.</p>
    <p>"You do not know, Bébée?" he said at length, knowing well himself; so much better than ever
     she knew. "Well, dear, that is not flattering to me. But it is natural. The good Virgin of
     course gives you all you have, food, and clothes, and your garden, and your pretty plump
     chickens; and I am only a stranger. You could not offend her for me; that is not likely."</p>
    <p>The child was cut to the heart by the sadness and humility of words of whose studied artifice
     she had no suspicion.</p>
    <p>She thought that she seemed to him ungrateful and selfish, and yet all the mooring-ropes that
     held her little boat of life to the harbor of its simple religion seemed cut away, and she
     seemed drifting helpless and rudderless upon an unknown sea.</p>
    <p>"I never did do wrong — that I know," she said, timidly, and lifted her eyes to his with an
     unconscious appeal in them.</p>
    <p>"But — I do not see why it should be wrong to speak with you. You are good, and you lend me
     beautiful things out of other men's minds that will make me less ignorant: Our Lady could not
     be angry with that — she must like it."</p>
    <p>"Our Lady? — oh, poor little simpleton! — where will her reign be when Ignorance has once been
     cut down root and branch?" he thought to himself: but he only answered, — </p>
    <p>"But whether she like it or not, Bébée? — you beg the question, my dear; you are — you are not so
     frank as usual — think, and tell me honestly?"</p>
    <p>He knew quite well, but it amused him to see the perplexed trouble that this, the first
     divided duty of her short years, brought with it.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked at him, and loosened her hand from his, and sat quite still. Her lips had a
     little quiver in them.</p>
    <p>"I think." she said at last, "I think — if it <emph>be</emph> wrong, still I will wish it — yes. Only
     I will not tell myself it is right. I will just say to Our Lady, 'I am wicked, perhaps, but I
     cannot help it' So, I will not deceive her at all; and perhaps in time she may forgive. But I
     think you only say it to try me. It cannot, I am sure, be wrong — any more than it is to talk to
     Jeannot or to Bac."</p>
    <p>He had driven her into the subtleties of doubt, but the honest little soul in her found a way
     out, as a flower in a cellar finds its way through the stones to light.</p>
    <p>He plucked the ivy leaves and threw them at the chickens on the bricks without, with a
     certain impatience in the action. The simplicity and the directness of the answer disarmed him;
     he was almost ashamed to use against her the weapons of his habitual warfare. It was like a
     maître d'armes fencing with bare steel against a little naked child armed with a blest
     palm-sheaf.</p>
    <p>When she had thus brought him all she had, and he to please her had sat down to the simple
     food, she gathered a spray of roses and set it in a pot beside him, then left him and went and
     stood at a little distance, waiting, with her hands lightly crossed on her chest, to see if
     there were anything that he might want.</p>
    <p>He ate and drank well to please her, looking at her often as he did so.</p>
    <p>"I break your bread, Bébée," he said, with a tone that seemed strange to her, — "I break your
     bread. I must keep Arab faith with you."</p>
    <p>"What is that?"</p>
    <p>"I mean — I must never betray you."</p>
    <p>"Betray me How could you?"</p>
    <p>"Well — hurt you in any way."</p>
    <p>"Ah, I am sure you would never do that."</p>
    <p>He was silent, and looked at the spray of roses.</p>
    <p>"Sit down and spin," he said impatiently. "I am ashamed to see you stand there, and a woman
     never looks so well as when she spins. Sit down, and I will eat the good things you have
     brought me. But I cannot if you stand and look."</p>
    <p>"I beg your pardon. I did not know," she said, ashamed lest she should have seemed rude to
     him; and she drew out her wheel under the light of the lattice, and sat down to it, and began
     to disentangle the threads.</p>
    <p>It was a pretty picture — the low, square casement; the frame of ivy, the pink and white of the
     climbing sweet-peas: the girl's head; the cool, wet leaves: the old wooden spinning-wheel, that
     purred like a sleepy cat.</p>
    <p>"I want to paint you as Gretchen, only it will be a shame." he said.</p>
    <p>"Who is Gretchen?"</p>
    <p>"You shall read of her by-and-by. And you live here all by yourself?"</p>
    <p>"Since Antoine died — yes."</p>
    <p>"And are never dull?"</p>
    <p>"I have no time, and I do not think I would be if I had time — there is so much to think of,
     and one never can understand."</p>
    <p>"But you must be very brave and laborious to do all your work yourself. Is it possible a
     child like you can spin, and wash, and bake, and garden, and do everything?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, many do more than I. Babette's eldest daughter is only twelve, and she does much more,
     because she has all the children to look after; and they are very, very poor; they often have
     nothing but a stew of nettles and perhaps a few snails, days together."</p>
    <p>"That is lean, bare, ugly, gruesome poverty; there is plenty of that everywhere. But you,
     Bébée — you are an idyll."</p>
    <p>Bébée looked across the hut and smiled, and broke her thread. She did not know what he meant,
     but if she were anything that pleased him, it was well.</p>
    <p>"Who were those beautiful women?" she said suddenly, the color mounting into her cheeks.</p>
    <p>"What women, my dear?"</p>
    <p>"Those I saw at the window with you, the other night — they had jewels."</p>
    <p>"Oh! — women, tiresome enough. If I had seen you, I would have dropped you some fruit. Poor
     little Bébée! Did you go by, and I never knew?"</p>
    <p>"You were laughing — "</p>
    <p>"Was I?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, and they <emph>were</emph> beautiful."</p>
    <p>"In their own eyes; not in mine."</p>
    <p>"No?"</p>
    <p>She stopped her spinning and gazed at him with wistful, wondering eyes. Could it be that they
     were not beautiful to him? those deep red, glowing, sun-basked dahlia flowers?</p>
    <p>"Do you know," she said very softly, with a flush of penitence that came and went, "when I
     saw them, I hated them; I confessed it to Father Francis next day. You seemed so content with,
     them, and they looked so gay and glad there — and then the jewels! Somehow, I seemed to myself
     such a little thing, and so ugly and mean. And yet, do you know — "</p>
    <p>"And yet — well?"</p>
    <p>"They did not look to me good — those women," said Bébée, thoughtfully, looking across at him
     in deprecation of his possible anger. "They were great people, I suppose, and they appeared
     very happy; but though I seemed nothing to myself after them, still I think I would not
     change."</p>
    <p>"You are wise without books, Bébée."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no, I am not wise at all. I only feel. And give me books; oh, pray, give me books! You
     do not know; I will learn so fast; and I will not neglect anything, that I promise. The
     neighbors and Jeannot say that I shall let the flowers die, and the hut get dirty, and never
     spin or prick Annémie's patterns; but that is untrue. I will do all, just as I have done, and
     more too, if only you will give me things to read, for I do think when one is happy, one ought
     to work more — not less."</p>
    <p>"But will these books make you happy? If you ask me the truth, I must tell you — no. You are
     happy as you are, because you know nothing else than your own little life; for ignorance
      <emph>is</emph> happiness, Bébée, let sages, ancient and modern, say what they will. But when you
     know a little, you will want to know more: and when you know much, you will want to see much
     also, and then — and then — the thing will grow — you will be no longer content. That is, you will be
     unhappy."</p>
    <p>Bébée watched him with wistful eyes.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps that is true. No doubt it is true, if you say it. But you know all the world seems
     full of voices that I hear, but that I cannot understand; it is with me as I should think it is
     with people who go to foreign countries and do not know the tongue that is spoken when they
     land; and it makes me unhappy, because I cannot comprehend, and so the books will not make me
     more so, but less. And as for being content — when I thought you were gone away out of the city,
     last night, I thought I would never be able to pray any more, because I hated myself, and I
     almost hated the angels, and I told Mary that she was cruel, and she turned her face from me — as
     it seemed, forever."</p>
    <p>She spoke quite quietly and simply, spinning as she spoke, and looking across at him with
     earnest eyes, that begged him to believe her. She was saying the pure truth, but she did not
     know the force or the meaning of that truth.</p>
    <p>He listened with a smile; it was not new to him; he knew her heart much better than she knew
     it herself, but there was an unconsciousness, and yet a strength, in the words that touched him
     though.</p>
    <p>He threw the leaves away, irritably, and told her to leave off her spinning.</p>
    <p>"Some day I shall paint you with that wheel as I painted the Broodhuis. Will you let me,
     Bébée?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>She answered him as she would have answered if he had told her to go on pilgrimage from one
     end of the Low Countries to the other.</p>
    <p>"What were you going to do to-day?"</p>
    <p>"I am going into the market with the flowers; I go every day."</p>
    <p>"How much will you make?"</p>
    <p>"Two or three francs, if I am lucky."</p>
    <p>"And do you never have a holiday?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes; but not often, you know, because it is on the fete days that the people want the
     most flowers."</p>
    <p>"But in the winter?"</p>
    <p>"Then I work at the lace."</p>
    <p>"Do you never go into the woods?"</p>
    <p>"I have been once or twice; but it loses a whole day."</p>
    <p>"You are afraid of not earning?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Because I am afraid of owing people anything."</p>
    <p>"Well, give up this one day, and we will make holiday. The people are out; they will not
     know. Come into the forest, and we will dine at a café in the woods; and we will be as poetic
     as you like, and I will tell you a tale of one called Rosalind, who pranked herself in boy's
     attire, all for love, in the Ardennes country yonder. Come, it is the very day for the forest;
     it will make me a lad again at Meudon, when the lilacs were in bloom. Poor Paris! Come."</p>
    <p>"Do you mean it?"</p>
    <p>The color was bright in her face, her heart was dancing, her little feet felt themselves
     already on the fresh green turf.</p>
    <p>She had no thought that there could be any harm in it. She would have gone with Jeannot or
     old Bac.</p>
    <p>"Of course I mean it. Come. I was going to Mayence to see the Magi and Van Dyck's Christ. We
     will go to Soignies instead, and study green leaves. I will paint your face by sunlight. It is
     the best way to paint you. You belong to the open air. So should Gretchen; or how else should
     she have the blue sky in her eyes?"</p>
    <p>"But I have only wooden shoes!"</p>
    <p>Her face was scarlet as she glanced at her feet; he who had wanted to give her the silk
     stockings — how would he like to be seen walking abroad with those two clumsy, clattering,
     work-a-day, little sabots?</p>
    <p>"Never mind. My dear, in my time I have had enough of satin shoes and of silver gilt heels;
     they click-clack as loud as yours, and cost much more to those who walk with them, not to
     mention that they will seldom deign to walk at all. Your wooden shoes are picturesque. Paganini
     made a violin out of a wooden shoe. Who knows what music may lurk in yours, only you have never
     heard it. Perhaps I have. It was Bac who gave you the red shoes that was the barbarian, not I.
     Come."</p>
    <p>"You really mean it?"</p>
    <p>"Come."</p>
    <p>"But they will miss me at market."</p>
    <p>"They will think you are gone on the pilgrimage: you need never tell them you have not."</p>
    <p>"But if they ask me?"</p>
    <p>"Does it never happen that you say any other thing than the truth?"</p>
    <p>"Any other thing than the truth! Of course not. People take for granted that one tells truth;
     it would be very base to cheat them. Do you really mean that I may come? — in the forest! — and you
     will tell me stories like those you give me to read?"</p>
    <p>"I will tell you a better story. Lock your hut, Bébée, and come."</p>
    <p>"And to think you are not ashamed!"</p>
    <p>"Ashamed?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, because of my wooden shoes."</p>
    <p>Was it possible? Bébée thought, as she ran out into the garden and locked the door behind
     her, and pushed the key under the waterbutt as usual, being quite content with that prudent
     precaution against robbers which had served Antoine all his days. Was it possible, this
     wonderful joy? — her cheeks were like her roses, her eyes had a brilliance like the sun; the
     natural grace and mirth of the child blossomed in a thousand ways and gestures.</p>
    <p>As she went by the shrine in the wall, she bent her knee a moment and made the sign of the
     cross; then she gathered a little moss-rose that nodded close under the border of the palisade,
     and turned and gave it to him.</p>
    <p>"Look, she sends you this. She is not angry, you see, and it is much more pleasure when she
     is pleased — do you not know?"</p>
    <p>He shrank a little as her fingers touched him.</p>
    <p>"What a pity you had no mother, Bébée!" he said, on an impulse of emotion, of which in Paris
     he would have been more ashamed than of any guilt.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
    <p>In the deserted lane by the swans' water, under the willows, the horses waited to take him to
     Mechlin; little, quick, rough horses, with round brass bells, in the Flemish fashion, and gay
     harness, and a low char-à-banc, in which a wolf-skin and red rugs, and all a painter's many
     necessities, were tossed together.</p>
    <p>He lifted her in, and the little horses flew fast through the green country, ringing chimes
     at each step, till they plunged into the deep glades of the woods of Cambre and Soignies.</p>
    <p>Bébée sat breathless with delight.</p>
    <p>She had never gone behind horses in all her life, except once or twice in a wagon when the
     tired teamsters had dragged a load of corn across the plains, or when the miller's old gray
     mare had hobbled wearily before a cart-load of noisy, happy, mischievous children going home
     from the masses and fairs, and flags, and flowers, and church banners, and puppet-shows, and
     lighted altars, and whirling merry-go-rounds of the Fête Dieu.</p>
    <p>She had never known what it was to sail as on the wings of the wind along broad roads, with
     yellow wheat-lands, and green hedges, and wayside trees, and little villages, and reedy canal
     water, all flying by her to the sing-song of the joyous bells.</p>
    <p>"Oh, how good it is to live!" she cried, clapping her hands in a very ecstasy, as the clear
     morning broadened into gold and the west wind rose and blew from the sands by the sea.</p>
    <p>"Yes — it is good — if one did not tire so soon," said he, watching her with a listless
     pleasure.</p>
    <p>But she did not hear; she was beyond the reach of any power to sadden her; she was watching
     the white oxen that stood on the purple brow of the just reapen lands, and the rosy clouds that
     blew like a shower of apple-blossoms across the sky to the south.</p>
    <p>There was a sad darkling Calvary on the edge of the harvest-field that looked black against
     the blue sky; its shadow fell across the road, but she did not see it: she was looking at the
     sun.</p>
    <p>There is not much change in the great Soignies woods. They are aisles on aisles of beautiful
     green trees, crossing and recrossing; tunnels of dark foliage that look endless; long avenues
     of beech, of oak, of elm, or of fir, with the bracken and the brushwood growing dense between;
     a delicious forest growth everywhere, shady even at noon, and by a little past midday dusky as
     evening; with the forest fragrance, sweet and dewy, all about, and under the fern the stirring
     of wild game, and the white gleam of little rabbits, and the sound of the wings of birds.</p>
    <p>Soignies is not legend-haunted like the Black Forest, nor king-haunted like Fontainebleau,
     nor sovereign of two historic streams like the brave woods of Heidelberg; nor wild and
     romantic, arid broken with black rocks, and poetized by the shade of Jaques, and swept through
     by a perfect river, like its neighbors of Ardennes; nor throned aloft on mighty mountains like
     the majestic oak glades of the Swabian hills of the ivory carvers.</p>
    <p>Soignies is only a Flemish forest in a plain, throwing its shadows over corn-fields and
     cattle pastures, with no panorama beyond it and no wonders in its depth. But it is a fresh,
     bold, beautiful forest for all that.</p>
    <p>It has only green leaves to give, — green leaves always, league after league; but there is
     about it that vague mystery which all forests have, and this universe of leaves seems
     boundless, and Pan might dwell in it, and St. Hubert, and John Keats.</p>
    <p>Bébée, in her rare holidays with the Bac children or with Jeannot's sisters, had never
     penetrated farther than the glades of the Cambre, and had never entered the heart of the true
     forest, which is much still what it must have been in the old days when the burghers of Brabant
     cut their yew bows and their pike staves from it to use against the hosts of Spain.</p>
    <p>To Bébée it was as an enchanted land, and every play of light and shade, every hare speeding
     across the paths, every thrush singing in the leaves, every little dog-rose or harebell that
     blossomed in the thickets, was to her a treasure, a picture, a poem, a delight.</p>
    <p>He had seen girls thus in the woods of Vincennes and of Versailles in the student days of his
     youth: little work-girls fresh from châlets of the Jura or from vine-hung huts of the Loire,
     who had brought their poor little charms to perish in Paris; and who dwelt under the hot tiles
     and amidst the gilded shop signs till they were as pale and thin as their own starved balsams;
     and who, when they saw the green woods, laughed and cried a little, and thought of the broad
     sun-swept fields, and wished that they were back again behind their drove of cows, or weeding
     among the green grapes.</p>
    <p>But those little work-girls had been mere homely daisies, and daisies already with the dust
     of the pavement and of the dancing-gardens upon them.</p>
    <p>Bébée was as pure and fresh as these dew-wet dog-roses that she found in the thickets of
     thorn.</p>
    <p>He had meant to treat her as he had used to do those work-girls — a little wine, a little
     wooing, a little folly and passion, idle as a butterfly and brief as a rainbow — one midsummer
     day and night — then a handful of gold, a caress, a good-morrow, and forgetfulness ever
     afterwards — that was what he had meant when he had brought her out to the forest of
     Soignies.</p>
    <p>But — she was different, this child.</p>
    <p>He made the great sketch of her for his Gretchen, sitting on a moss-grown trunk, with
     marguerites in her hand; he sent for their breakfast far into the woods, and saw her set her
     pearly teeth into early peaches and costly sweetmeats; he wandered with her hither and thither,
     and told her tales out of the poets and talked to her in the dreamy, cynical, poetical manner
     that was characteristic of him, being half artificial and half sorrowful, as his temper
     was.</p>
    <p>But Bébée, all unconscious, intoxicated with happiness, and yet touched by it into that vague
     sadness which the summer sun brings with it even to young things, if they have soul in
     them, — Bébée said to him what the work-girls of Paris never had done.</p>
    <p>Beautiful things: things fantastic, ignorant, absurd, very simple, very unreasonable
     oftentimes, but things beautiful always, and sometimes even very wise by a wisdom not of the
     world; by a certain light divine that does shine now and then as through an alabaster lamp,
     through minds that have no grossness to obscure them.</p>
    <p>Her words were not equal to the burden of her thoughts at times, but he knew how to take the
     pearl of the thought from the broken shell and tangled sea-weed of her simple, untutored
     speech.</p>
    <p>"If there be a God anywhere," he thought to himself, "this little Fleming is very near
     him."</p>
    <p>She was so near that, although he had no belief in any God, he could not deal with her as he
     had used to do with the work-girls in the primrose paths of old Vincennes.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
    <p>"To be Gretchen, you must count the leaves of your daisies," he said to her, as he
     painted, — painted her just as she was, with her two little white feet in the wooden shoes, and
     the thick green leaves behind; the simplest picture possible, the dress of gray — only cool dark
     gray — with white linen bodice, and no color anywhere except in the green of the foliage; but
     where he meant the wonder and the charm of it to lie was in the upraised, serious, child-like
     face, and the gaze of the grave, smiling eyes.</p>
    <p>It was Gretchen, spinning, out in the open air among the flowers. Gretchen, with the tall
     dog-daisies growing up about her feet, among the thyme and the roses, before she had had need
     to gather, one to ask her future of its parted leaves.</p>
    <p>The Gretchen of Scheffer tells no tale; she is a fair-haired, hard-working, simple-minded
     peasant, with whom neither angels nor devils have anything to do, and whose eyes never can open
     to either hell or heaven. But the Gretchen of Flamen said much more than this: looking at it,
     men would sigh from shame, and women weep from sorrow.</p>
    <p>"Count the daisies?" echoed Bébée. "Oh, I know what you mean. A
     little — much — passionately — until death — not at all. What the girls say when they want to see if
     any one loves them? Is that it?"</p>
    <p>She looked at him without any consciousness, except as she loved the flowers.</p>
    <p>"Do you think the daisies know?" she went on, seriously, parting their petals with her
     fingers. "Flowers do know many things — that is certain."</p>
    <p>"Ask them for yourself."</p>
    <p>"Ask them what?"</p>
    <p>"How much — any one — loves you?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, but every one loves me; there is no one that is bad. Antoine used to say to me. 'Never
     think of yourself, Bébée; always think of other people, so every one will love you.' And I
     always try to do that, and every one does."</p>
    <p>"But that is not the love the daisy tells of to your sex."</p>
    <p>"No?"</p>
    <p>"No; the girls that you see count the flowers — they are thinking, not of all the village, but
     of some one unlike all the rest, whose shadow falls across theirs in the moonlight! You know
     that?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, yes — and they marry afterwards — yes."</p>
    <p>She said it softly, musingly, with no embarrassment; it was an unreal, remote thing to her,
     and yet it stirred her heart a little with a vague trouble that was infinitely sweet.</p>
    <p>There is little talk of love in the lives of the poor; they have no space for it; love to
     them means more mouths to feed, more wooden shoes to buy, more hands to dive into the meagre
     bag of coppers. Now and then a girl of the commune had been married, and had ploughing in the
     fields or to her lace-weaving in the city. Bébée had thought little of it.</p>
    <p>"They marry or they do not marry. That is as it may be," said Flamen, with a smile. "Bébée, I
     must paint you as Gretchen before she made a love-dial of the daisies. What is the story? Oh, I
     have told you stories enough. Gretchen's you would not understand, just yet."</p>
    <p>"But what did the daisies say to her?"</p>
    <p>"My dear, the daisies always say the same thing, because daisies always tell the truth and
     know men. The daisies always say 'a little'; it is the girl's ear that tricks her, and makes
     her hear 'till death,' — a folly and falsehood of which the daisy is not guilty."</p>
    <p>"But who says it if the daisy does not?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, the devil perhaps — who knows? He has so much to do in these things."</p>
    <p>But Bébée did not smile; she had a look of horror in her blue eyes; she belonged to a
     peasantry who believed in exorcising the fiend by the aid of the cross, and who not so very
     many generations before had driven him out of human bodies by rack and flame.</p>
    <p>She looked with a little wistful fear on the white, golden-eyed marguerites that lay on her
     lap.</p>
    <p>"Do you think the fiend is in these?" she whispered, with awe in her voice.</p>
    <p>Flamen smiled. "When you count them he will be there, no doubt."</p>
    <p>Bébée threw them with a shudder on the grass.</p>
    <p>"Have I spoilt your holiday, dear?" he said, with a certain self-reproach.</p>
    <p>She was silent a minute, then she gathered up the daisies again, and stroked them and put
     them to her lips.</p>
    <p>"It is not they that do wrong. You say the girls' ears deceive them. It is the girls who want
     a lie and will not believe a truth because it humbles them; it is the girls that are to blame,
     not the daisies. As for me, I will not ask the daisies anything ever, so the fiend will not
     enter into them."</p>
    <p>"Nor into you. Poor little Bébée!"</p>
    <p>"Why, you pity me for that?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Because, if women never see the serpent's face, neither do they ever scent the smell of
     the paradise roses; and it will be hard for you to die without a single rose d'amour in your
     pretty breast, poor little Bébée?"</p>
    <p>"I do not understand. But you frighten me a little."</p>
    <p>He rose and left his easel and threw himself at her feet on the grass; he took the little
     wooden shoes in his hands as reverently as he would have taken the broidered shoes of a
     duchess; he looked up at her with tender, smiling eyes.</p>
    <p>"Poor little Bébée!" he said again. "Did I frighten you indeed? Nay, that was very base of
     me. We will not spoil our summer holiday. There is no such thing as a fiend, my dear. There are
     only men — such as I am. Say the daisy spell over for me, Bébée. See if I do not love you a
     little, just as you love your flowers."</p>
    <p>She smiled, and the happy laughter came again over her face.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I am sure you care for me a little," she said, softly, "or you would not be so good and
     get me books and give me pleasure; and I do not want the daisies to tell me that, because you
     say it yourself, which is better."</p>
    <p>"Much better." he answered her dreamily, and lay there in the grass, holding the little
     wooden shoes in his hands.</p>
    <p>He was not in love with her. He was in no haste. He preferred to play with her softly,
     slowly, as one separates the leaves of a rose, to see the deep rose of its heart.</p>
    <p>Her own ignorance of what she felt had a charm for him. He liked to lift the veil from her
     eyes by gentle degrees, watching each new pulse-beat, each fresh instinct tremble into
     life.</p>
    <p>It was an old, old story to him; he knew each chapter and verse to weariness, though there
     still was no other story that he still read as often. But to her it was so new.</p>
    <p>To him it was a long beaten track; he knew every turn of it; he recognized every wayside
     blossom; he had passed over a thousand times each tremulous bridge; he knew so well beforehand
     where each shadow would fall, and where each fresh bud would blossom, and where each harvest
     would be reaped.</p>
    <p>But to her it was so new.</p>
    <p>She followed him as a blind child a man that guides her through a garden and reads her a
     wonder tale.</p>
    <p>He was good to her, that was all she knew. When he touched her ever so lightly she felt a
     happiness so perfect, and yet so unintelligible, that she could have wished to die in it.</p>
    <p>And in her humility and her ignorance she wondered always how he — so great, so wise, so
     beautiful — could have thought it ever worth his while to leave the paradise of Rubes' land to
     wait with her under her little rush-thatched roof, and bring her here to see the green leaves
     and the living things of the forest.</p>
    <p>As they went, a man was going under the trees with a load of wood upon his back. Bébée gave a
     little cry of recognition.</p>
    <p>"Oh, look, that is Jeannot! How he will wonder to see me here!"</p>
    <p>Flamen drew her a little downward, so that the forester passed onward without perceiving
     them.</p>
    <p>"Why do you do that?" said Bébée. "Shall I not speak to him?"</p>
    <p>"Why? To have all your neighbors chatter of your feast in the forest? It is not worth
     while."</p>
    <p>"Ah, but I always tell them everything," said Bébée. whose imagination had been already busy
     with the wonders that she would unfold to Mère Krebs and the Varnhart children.</p>
    <p>"Then you will see but little of me, my dear. Learn to be silent, Bébée. It is a woman's
     first duty, though her hardest."</p>
    <p>"Is it?"</p>
    <p>She did not speak for some time. She could not imagine a state of things in which she would
     not narrate the little daily miracles of her life to the good old garrulous women and the
     little open-mouthed romps. And yet — she lifted her eyes to his.</p>
    <p>"I am glad you have told me that," she said. "Though indeed. I do not see why one should not
     say what one does, yet — somehow — I do not like to talk about you. It is like the pictures in the
     galleries, and the music in the cathedral, and the great still evenings, when the fields are
     all silent, and it is as if Christ walked abroad in them; I do not know how to talk of those
     things to the others — only to you — and I do not like to talk <emph>about</emph> you to them — do you
     not know?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I know. But what affinity have I. Bébée, to your thoughts of your God walking in His
     cornfields?"</p>
    <p>Bébée's eyes glanced down through the green aisle of the forests, with the musing seriousness
     in them that was like the child-angels of Botticelli's dreams.</p>
    <p>"I cannot tell you very well. But when I am in the fields at evening and think of Christ. I
     feel so happy, and of such good will to all the rest, and I seem to see heaven quite plain
     through the beautiful gray air where the stars are — and so I feel when I am with you — that is
     all. Only — "</p>
    <p>"Only what?"</p>
    <p>"Only in those evenings, when I was all alone, heaven seemed up there, where the stars are,
     and I longed for wings; but now, it is <emph>here</emph>, and I would only shut my wings if I had
     them, and not stir."</p>
    <p>He looked at her, and took, her hands and kissed them — but reverently — as a believer may kiss a
     shrine. In that moment to Flamen she was sacred; in that moment he could no more have hurt her
     with passion than he could have hurt her with a blow.</p>
    <p>It was an emotion with him, and did not endure. But whilst it lasted, it was true.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
    <p>Then he took her to dine at one of the wooden cafés under the trees. There was a little sheet
     of water in front of it and a gay garden around. There was a balcony and a wooden stairway;
     there were long trellised arbors, and little white tables, and great rosebushes like her own at
     home. They had an arbor all to themselves; a cool sweet-smelling bower of green, with a glimpse
     of scarlet from the flowers of some twisting beans.</p>
    <p>They had a meal, the like of which she had never seen; such a huge melon in the centre of it,
     and curious wines, and coffee or cream in silver pots, or what looked like silver to her — "just
     like the altar-vases in the church," she said to herself.</p>
    <p>"If only the Varnhart children were here!" she cried; but he did not echo the wish.</p>
    <p>It was just sunset. There was a golden glow on the little bit of water. On the other side of
     the garden some one was playing a guitar. Under a lime-tree some girls were swinging, crying,
     Higher! higher! at each toss.</p>
    <p>In a longer avenue of trellised green, at a long table, there was a noisy party of students
     and girls of the city; their laughter was mellowed by distance as it came over the breadth of
     the garden, and they sang, with fresh shrill Flemish voices, songs from an opera bouffe of La
     Monnaie.</p>
    <p>It was all pretty, and gay, and pleasant.</p>
    <p>There was everywhere about an air of light-hearted enjoyment. Bébée sat with a wondering look
     in her wide-opened eyes, and all the natural instincts of her youth, that were like curled-up
     fruit buds in her, unclosed softly to the light of joy.</p>
    <p>"Is life always like this in your Rubes' land?" she asked him; that vague far-away country of
     which she never asked him anything more definite, and which yet was so clear before her
     fancy.</p>
    <p>"Yes," he made answer to her. "Only — instead of those leaves, flowers and pomegranates; and in
     lieu of that tinkling guitar, a voice whose notes are esteemed like king's jewels; and in place
     of those little green arbors, great white palaces, cool and still, with ilex woods and orange
     groves and sapphire seas beyond them. Would you like to come there, Bébée? — and wear laces such
     as you weave, and hear singing and laughter all night long, and never work any more in the
     mould of the garden, or spin any more at that tiresome wheel, or go any more out in the wind,
     and the rain, and the winter mud to the market?"</p>
    <p>Bébée listened, leaning her round elbows on the table, and her warm cheeks on her hands, as a
     child gravely listens to a fairy story. But the sumptuous picture, and the sensuous phrase he
     had chosen, passed by her.</p>
    <p>It is of no use to tempt the little chaffinch of the woods with a ruby instead of a cherry.
     The bird is made to feed on the brown berries, on the morning dews, on the scarlet hips of
     roses, and the blossoms of the wind-tossed pear boughs; the gem, though it be a monarch's, will
     only strike hard and tasteless on its beak.</p>
    <p>"I would like to see it all," said Bébée, musingly trying to follow out her thoughts. "But as
     for the garden work and the spinning — that I do not want to leave, because I have done it all my
     life; and I do not think I should care to wear lace — it would tear very soon; one would be
     afraid to run; and do you see I know how it is made — all that lace. I know how blind the eyes
     get over it, and how the hearts ache; I know how the old women starve, and the little children
     cry; I know that there is not a sprig of it that is not stitched with pain; the great ladies do
     not think, I dare say, because they have never worked at it or watched the others: but I have.
     And so, you see, I think if I wore it I should feel sad, and if a nail caught on it I should
     feel as if it were tearing the flesh of my friends. Perhaps I say it badly; but that is what I
     feel."</p>
    <p>"You do not say it badly — you speak well, for you speak from the heart," he answered her, and
     felt a tinge of shame that he had tempted her with the gold and purple of a baser world than
     any that she knew.</p>
    <p>"And yet you want to see new lands?" he pursued. "What is it you want to see there?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, quite other things than these," cried Bébée, still leaning her cheeks on her hands.
     "That dancing and singing is very pretty and merry, but it is just as good when old Claude
     fiddles and the children skip. This wine, you tell me, is something very great; but fresh milk
     is much nicer, I think. It is not these kind of things I want — I want to know all about the
     people who lived before us; I want to know what the stars are, and what the wind is; I want to
     know where the lark goes when you lose him out of sight against the sun; I want to know how the
     old artists got to see God, that they could paint him and all his angels as they have done; I
     want to know how the voices got into the bells, and how they can make one's heart beat, hanging
     up there as they do, all alone among the jackdaws; I want to know what it is when I walk in the
     fields in the morning, and it is all gray and soft and still, and the corn-crake cries in the
     wheat, and the little mice run home to their holes, that makes me so glad and yet so sorrowful,
     as if I were so very near God, and yet so all alone, and such a little thing; because you see
     the mouse she has her hole, and the crake her own people, but I — "</p>
    <p>Her voice faltered a little and stopped: she had never before thought out into words her own
     loneliness; from the long green arbor the voices of the girls and the students sang, — </p>
    <p>"Ah! le doux son d'un baiser tendre!"</p>
    <p>Flamen was silent. The poet in him — and in an artist there is always more or less of the
     poet — kept him back from ridicule, nay, moved him to pity and respect.</p>
    <p>They were absurdly simple words no doubt, had little wisdom in them, and were quite childish
     in their utterance, and yet they moved him curiously as a man very base and callous may at
     times be moved by the look in a dying deer's eyes, or by the sound of a song that some lost
     love once sang.</p>
    <p>He rose and drew her hands away, and took her small face between his own hands instead.</p>
    <p>"Poor little Bébée!" he said gently, looking down on her with a breath that was almost a
     sigh. "Poor little Bébée! — to envy the corncrake and the mouse!"</p>
    <p>She was a little startled; her cheeks grew very warm under his touch, but her eyes looked
     still into his without fear.</p>
    <p>He stooped and touched her forehead with his lips, gently and without passion, almost
     reverently; she grew rose-hued as the bright bean-flowers, up to the light gold ripples of her
     hair; she trembled a little and drew back, but she was not alarmed nor yet ashamed; she was too
     simple of heart to feel the fear that is born of passion and of consciousness.</p>
    <p>It was as Jeannot kissed his sister Marie, who was fifteen years old and sold milk for the
     Krebs people in the villages with a little green cart and a yellow dog — no more.</p>
    <p>And yet the sunny arbor leaves and the glimpse of the blue sky swam round her indistinctly,
     and the sounds of the guitar grew dull upon her ear and were lost as in a rushing hiss of
     water, because of the great sudden unintelligible happiness that seemed to bear her little life
     away on it as a sea wave bears a young child off its feet.</p>
    <p>"You do not feel alone now, Bébée?" he whispered to her.</p>
    <p>"No!" she answered him softly under her breath, and sat still, while all her body quivered
     like a leaf.</p>
    <p>No; how could she ever be alone now that this sweet, soft, unutterable touch would always be
     in memory upon her; how could she wish ever again now to be the corn-crake in the summer corn
     or the gray mouse in the hedge of hawthorn?</p>
    <p>At that moment a student went by past the entrance of the arbor; he had a sash round his
     loins and a paper feather in his cap; he was playing a fife and dancing; he glanced in as he
     went.</p>
    <p>"It is time to go home, Bébée," said Flamen.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
    <p>So it came to pass that Bébée's day in the big forest came and went as simply almost as any
     day that she had played away with the Varnhart children under the beech shadows of Cambre
     woods.</p>
    <p>And when he took her to her hut at sunset before the pilgrims had returned there was a great
     bewildered tumult of happiness in her heart, but there was no memory with her that prevented
     her from looking at the shrine in the wall as she passed it, and saying with a quick gesture of
     the cross on brow and bosom, — </p>
    <p>"Ah, dear Holy Mother, how good you have been! and I am back again, you see, and I will work
     harder than ever because of all this joy that you have given me."</p>
    <p>And she took another moss-rose and changed it for that of the morning, which was faded, and
     said to Flamen. — </p>
    <p>"Look — she sends you this. Now do you know what I mean? One is more content when She is
     content."</p>
    <p>He did not answer, but he held her hands against him a moment as they fastened in the rose
     bud.</p>
    <p>"Not a word to the pilgrims, Bébée — you remember?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I will remember. I do not tell them every time I pray — it will be like being silent
     about that — it will be no more wrong than that."</p>
    <p>But there was a touch of anxiety in the words; she was not quite certain; she wanted to be
     reassured. Instinct moved her not to speak of him; but habit made it seem wrong to her to have
     any secret from the people who had been about her from her birth.</p>
    <p>He did not reassure her; her anxiety was pretty to watch, and he left the trouble in her
     heart like a bee in the chalice of a lily. Besides, the little wicket gate was between them; he
     was musing whether he would push it open once more.</p>
    <p>Her fate was in the balance, though she did not dream it: he had dealt with her tenderly,
     honestly, sacredly all that day — almost as much so as stupid Jeannot could have done. He had
     been touched by her trust in him, and by the unconscious beauty of her fancies, into a mood
     that was unlike all his life and habits. But after all, he said to himself — </p>
    <p>After all! — </p>
    <p>Where he stood in the golden evening he saw the rosy curled mouth, the soft troubled eves,
     the little brown hands that still tried to fasten the rosebud, the young peach-like skin where
     the wind stirred the bodice; — she was only a little Flemish peasant, this poor little Bébée, a
     little thing of the fields and the streets, for all the dreams of God that abode with her.
     After all — soon or late — the end would be always the same. What matter!</p>
    <p>She would weep a little to-morrow, and she would not kneel any more at the shrine in the
     garden wall; and then — and then — she would stay here and marry the good boor Jeannot, just the
     same after a while; or drift away after him to Paris, and leave her two little wooden shoes,
     and her visions of Christ in the fields at evening, behind her forevermore, and do as all the
     others did, and take not only silken stockings but the Cinderella slipper that is called Gold,
     which brings all other good things in its train; — what matter!</p>
    <p>He had meant this from the first, because she was so pretty, and those little wooden sabots
     ran so lithely over the stones; though he was not in love with her, but only idly stretched his
     hand for her as a child by instinct stretches to a fruit that hangs in the sun a little rosier
     and a little nearer than the rest.</p>
    <p>What matter — he said to himself — she loved him, poor little soul, though she did not know it;
     and there would always be Jeannot glad enough of a handful of bright French gold.</p>
    <p>He pushed the gate gently against her; her hands fastened the rosebud and drew open the latch
     themselves.</p>
    <p>"Will you come in a little?" she said, with the happy light in her face. "You must not stay
     long, because the flowers must be watered, and then there are Annémie's patterns — they must be
     done or she will have no money and so no food — but if you would come in for a little? And see,
     if you wait a minute I will show you the roses that I shall cut to-morrow the first thing, and
     take down to St. Guido to Our Lady's altar in thank-offering for to-day. I should like you to
     choose them — you yourself — and if you would just touch them I should feel as if you gave them to
     her too. Will you?"</p>
    <p>She spoke with the pretty outspoken frankness of her habitual speech, just tempered and
     broken with the happy, timid hesitation, the curious sense at once of closer nearness and of
     greater distance, that had come on her since he had kissed her among the bright
     beanflowers.</p>
    <p>He turned from her quickly.</p>
    <p>"No, dear, no. Gather your roses alone, Bébée; if I touch them their leaves will fall."</p>
    <p>Then, with a hurriedly backward glance down the dusky lane to see that none were looking, he
     bent his head and kissed her again quickly and with a sort of shame, and swung the gate behind
     him and went away through the boughs and the shadows.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
    <p>Bébée looked after him wistfully till his figure was lost in the gloom.</p>
    <p>The village was very quiet; a dog barking afar off and a cow lowing in the meadow were the
     only living things that made their presence heard; the pilgrims had not returned.</p>
    <p>She leaned on the gate a few minutes in that indistinct, dreamy happiness which is the
     prerogative of innocent love.</p>
    <p>"How wonderful it is that he should give a thought to me!" she said again and again to
     herself. It was as if a king had stooped for a little knot of daisied grass to set it in his
     crown where the great diamonds should be.</p>
    <p>She did not reason. She did not question. She did not look beyond that hour — such is the
     privilege of youth.</p>
    <p>"How I will read! How I will learn! How wise I will try to be; and how good, if I can!" she
     thought, swaying the little gate lightly under her weight, and looking with glad eyes at the
     goats as they frisked with their young in the pasture on the other side of the big trees,
     whilst one by one the stars came out, and an owl hooted from the palace woods, and the frogs
     croaked good-nights in the rushes.</p>
    <p>Then, like a little day laborer as she was, with the habit of toil and the need of the poor
     upon her from her birth up, she shut down the latch of the gate, kissed it where his hand had
     rested, and went to the well to draw its nightly draught for the dry garden.</p>
    <p>"Oh, dear roses!" she said to them as she rained the silvery showers over their nodding
     heads. "Oh, dear roses! — tell me — was ever anybody so happy as I am? Oh, if you say 'yes' I shall
     tell you you lie; silly flowers that were only born yesterday!"</p>
    <p>But the roses shook the water off them in the wind, and said, as she wished them to say, — </p>
    <p>"No — no one — ever before, Bébée — no one ever before."</p>
    <p>For roses, like everything else upon earth, only speak what our own heart puts into them.</p>
    <p>An old man went past up the lane; old Jehan, who was too ailing and aged to make one of the
     pilgrimage. He looked at the little quick-moving form, grayish white in the starlight, with the
     dark copper vessel balanced on her head, going to and fro betwixt the well and the garden.</p>
    <p>"You did not go to the pilgrimage, poor little one!" he said across the sweetbrier hedge.
     "Nay, that was too bad; work, work, work — thy pretty back should not be bent double yet. You
     want a holiday, Bébée; well, the Fête Dieu is near. Jeannot shall take you, and maybe I can
     find a few sous for gingerbread and merry-go-rounds. You sit dull in the market all day; you
     want a feast."</p>
    <p>Bébée colored behind the hedge, and ran in and brought three new-laid eggs that she had left
     in the flour-bin in the early morning, and thrust them on him through a break in the brier. It
     was the first time she had ever done anything of which she might not speak: she was ashamed,
     and yet the secret was so sweet to her.</p>
    <p>"I am very happy, Jehan, thank God!" she murmured, with a tremulous breath and a shine in her
     eyes that the old man's ears and sight were too dull to discern.</p>
    <p>"So was <emph>she</emph>" muttered Jehan, as he thrust the eggs into his old patched blue
     blouse, — "so was she. And then a stumble — a blow in the lane there — a horse's kick — and all was
     over. All over, my pretty one — for ever and ever."</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
    <p>On a sudden impulse Flamen, going through the woodland shadows to the city, paused and turned
     back; all his impulses were quick and swayed him now hither, now thither, in many contrary
     ways.</p>
    <p>He knew that the hour was come — that he must leave her and spare her, as to himself he phrased
     it, or teach her the love words that the daisies whisper to women.</p>
    <p>And why not? — anyway she would marry Jeannot.</p>
    <p>He, half-way to the town, walked back again and paused a moment at the gate; an emotion half
     pitiful, half cynical, stirred in him.</p>
    <p>Anyway he would leave her in a few days: Paris had again opened her arms to him; his old life
     awaited him; women who claimed him by imperious, amorous demands reproached him; and after all
     this day he had got the Gretchen of his ideal, a great picture for the future of his fame.</p>
    <p>As he would leave her anyway so soon, he would leave her unscathed — poor little field
     flower — he could never take it with him to blossom or wither in Paris.</p>
    <p>His world would laugh too utterly if he made for himself a mistress out of a little Fleming
     in two wooden shoes. Besides — </p>
    <p>Besides, something that was half weak and half noble moved him not to lead this child, in her
     trust and her ignorance, into ways that when she awakened from her trance would seem to her
     shameful and full of sorrow. For he knew that Bébée was not as others are.</p>
    <p>He turned back and knocked at the hut door and opened it.</p>
    <p>Bébée was just beginning to undress herself; she had taken off her white kerchief and her
     wooden shoes; her pretty shoulders and her little neck shone white in the moon; her feet were
     bare on the mud floor.</p>
    <p>She started with a cry and threw the handkerchief again on her shoulders, but there was no
     fear of him; only the unconscious instinct of her girlhood.</p>
    <p>He thought for a moment that he would not go away until the morrow — </p>
    <p>"Did you want me?" said Bébée softly, with happy eyes of surprise and yet a little startled,
     fearing some evil might have happened to him that he should have returned thus.</p>
    <p>"No; I do not want you, dear," he said gently; no — he did not want her, poor little soul; she
     wanted him, but he — there were so many of these things in his life, and he liked her too well to
     love her.</p>
    <p>"No, dear, I did not want you," said Flamen, drawing her arms about him, and feeling her
     flutter like a little bird, while the moonlight came in through the green leaves and fell in
     fanciful patterns on the floor. "But I came to say — you have had one happy day. Wholly happy,
     have you not, poor little Bébée?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, yes!" she sighed rather than said the answer in her wondrous gladness; drawn there close
     to him, with the softness of his lips upon her. Could he have come back only to ask that?</p>
    <p>"Well, that is something. You will remember it always, Bébée?" he murmured in his unconscious
     cruelty. "I did not wish to spoil your cloudless pleasure, dear — for you care for me a little,
     do you not? — so I came back to tell you only now, that I go away for a little while
     to-morrow."</p>
    <p>"Go away!"</p>
    <p>She trembled in his arms and turned cold as ice; a great terror and darkness fell upon her;
     she had never thought that he would ever go away. He caressed her, and played with her as a boy
     may with a bird before he wrings its neck.</p>
    <p>"You will come back?"</p>
    <p>He kissed her: "Surely."</p>
    <p>"To-morrow?"</p>
    <p>"Nay — not so soon."</p>
    <p>"In a week?"</p>
    <p>"Hardly."</p>
    <p>"In a month, then?"</p>
    <p>"Perhaps."</p>
    <p>"Before winter, anyway?"</p>
    <p>He looked aside from the beseeching, tearful, candid eyes, and kissed her hair and her
     throat, and said, "Yes, dear — beyond a doubt."</p>
    <p>She clung to him, crying silently; he wished that women would not weep.</p>
    <p>"Come, Bébée, listen," he said coaxingly, thinking to break the bitterness to her. "This is
     not wise, and it gives me pain. There is so much for you to do. You know so little. There is so
     much to learn. I will leave you many books, and you must grow quite learned in my absence. The
     Virgin is all very well in her way, but she cannot teach us much, poor lady. For her kingdom is
     called Ignorance. You must teach yourself. I leave you that to do. The days will go by quickly
     if you are laborious and patient. Do you love me, little one?"</p>
    <p>For an answer she kissed his hand.</p>
    <p>"You are a busy little Bébée always," he said, with his lips caressing her soft brown arms
     that were round his neck. "But you must be busier than ever whilst I am gone. So you will
     forget. No, no, I do not mean that: — I mean so the time will pass quickest. And I shall finish
     your picture, Bébée, and all Paris will see you, and the great ladies will envy the little girl
     with her two wooden shoes. Ah! that does not please you? — you care for none of these vanities.
     No. Poor little Bébée, why did God make you, or Chance breathe life into you? You are so far
     away from us all. It was cruel. What harm has your poor little soul ever done that, pure as a
     flower, it should have been sent to the hell of this world?"</p>
    <p>She clung to him, sobbing without sound. "You will come back? You will come back?" she
     moaned, clasping him closer and closer.</p>
    <p>Flamen's own eyes grew dim. But he lied to her: "I will — I promise."</p>
    <p>It was so much easier to say so, and it would break her sorrow. So he thought.</p>
    <p>For the moment again he was tempted to take her with him — but, he resisted it — he would tire,
     and she would cling to him forever.</p>
    <p>There was a long silence. The bleating of the little kid in the shed without was the only
     sound; the gray lavender blew to and fro.</p>
    <p>Her arms were close about his throat; he kissed them again, and kissed her eyes, her cheek,
     her mouth; then put her from him quickly and went out.</p>
    <p>She ran to him, and threw herself on the damp ground and held him there, and leaned her
     forehead on his feet. But though he looked at her with wet eyes, he did not yield, and he still
     said, — </p>
    <p>"I will come back soon — very soon; be quiet, dear, let me go."</p>
    <p>Then he kissed her once more many times, and put her gently within the door and closed
     it.</p>
    <p>A low, sharp, sudden cry reached him, went to his heart, but he did not turn; he went on
     through the wet, green little garden, and the curling leaves, where he had found peace and had
     left desolation.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
    <p>"I will let her alone, and she will marry Jeannot," thought Flamen; and he believed himself a
     good man for once in his life, and pitied himself for having become a sentimentalist.</p>
    <p>She would marry Jeannot, and bear many children, as those people always did; and ruddy little
     peasants would cling about these pretty, soft, little breasts of hers; and she would love them
     after the manner of such women, and be very content clattering over the stones in her wooden
     shoes; and growing brown and stout, and more careful after money, and ceasing to dream of
     unknown things, and not seeing God at all in the fields, but looking low and beholding only the
     ears of the gleaning wheat and the feet of the tottering children; and so gaining her bread,
     and losing her soul, and stooping nearer and nearer to earth till she dropped into it like one
     of her own wind-blown wall-flowers when the bee has sucked out all its sweetness and the heats
     have scorched up all its bloom: — yes, of course, she would marry Jeannot and end so!</p>
    <p>Meanwhile he had his Gretchen, and that was the one great matter.</p>
    <p>So he left the street of Mary of Burgundy, and went on his way out of the chiming city as its
     matin bells were rung, and took with him a certain regret, and the only innocent affection that
     had ever awakened in him; and thought of his self-negation with half admiration and half
     derision; and so drifted away into the whirlpool of his amorous, cynical, changeful,
     passionate, callous, many-colored life, and said to himself as he saw the last line of the low
     green plains shine against the sun, "She will marry Jeannot — of course, she will marry Jeannot.
     And my Gretchen is greater than Scheffer's."</p>
    <p>What else mattered very much, after all, except what they would say in Paris of Gretchen?</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
    <p>People saw that Bébée had grown very quiet. But that was all they saw.</p>
    <p>Her little face was pale as she sat among her glowing autumn blossoms, by the side of the
     cobbler's stall; and when the Varnhart children cried at the gate to her to come and play, she
     would answer gently that she was too busy to have play-time now.</p>
    <p>The fruit girl of the Montagne de la Cour hooted after her, "Gone so soon? — oh hé! what did I
     say? — a fine pine is sugar in the teeth a second only, but the brown nuts you may crack all the
     seasons round. Well, did you make good harvest while it lasted? has Jeannot a fat bridal
     portion promised?"</p>
    <p>And old Jehan, who was the tenderest soul of them all in the lane by the swans' water, would
     come and look at her wistfully as she worked among the flowers, and would say to her, — </p>
    <p>"Dear little one, there is some trouble: does it come of that painted picture? You never
     laugh now, Bébée, and that is bad. A girl's laugh is pretty to hear; my girl laughed like
     little bells ringing — and then it stopped, all at once; they said she was dead. But you are not
     dead, Bébée. And yet you are so silent; one would say you were."</p>
    <p>But to the mocking of the fruit girl, as to the tenderness of old Jehan, Bébée answered
     nothing; the lines of her pretty curled mouth grew grave and sad, and in her eyes there was a
     wistful, bewildered, pathetic appeal like the look in the eyes of a beaten dog, which, while it
     aches with pain, does not cease to love its master.</p>
    <p>One resolve upheld and made her feet firm on the stones of the streets and her lips mute
     under all they said to her. She would learn all she could, and be good, and patient, and wise,
     if trying could make her wise, and so do his will in all things — until he should come back.</p>
    <p>"You are not gay, Bébée," said Annémie, who grew so blind that she could scarce see the flags
     at the mastheads, and who still thought that she pricked the lace patterns and earned her
     bread. "You are not gay, dear. Has any lad gone to sea that your heart goes away with, and do
     you watch for his ship coming in with the coasters? It is weary work waiting; but it is all the
     men think us fit for, child. They may set sail as they like; every new port has new faces for
     them; but we are to sit still and to pray if we like, and never murmur, be the voyage ever so
     long, but be ready with a smile and a kiss, a fresh pipe of tobacco, and a dry pair of
     socks; — that is a man. We may have cried our hearts out; we must have ready the pipe and the
     socks, or, 'Is that what you call love?' they grumble. You want mortal patience if you love a
     man, — it is like a fretful child that thumps you when your breast is bare to it. Still, be you
     patient, dear, just as I am, just as I am."</p>
    <p>And Bébée would shudder as she swept the cobwebs from the garret walls, — patient as she was,
     she who had sat here fifty years watching for a dead man and for a wrecked ship.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
    <p>The wheat was reapen in the fields, and the brown earth turned afresh. The white and purple
     chrysanthemums bloomed against the flowerless rose-bushes, and the little gray Michaelmas daisy
     flourished where the dead carnations had spread their glories. Leaves began to fall and chilly
     winds to sigh among the willows; the squirrels began to store away their nuts, and the poor to
     pick up the broken bare boughs.</p>
    <p>"He said he would come before winter," thought Bébée, every day when she rose and felt each
     morning cooler and grayer than the one before it; winter was near.</p>
    <p>Her little feet already were cold in their wooden shoes; and the robin already sang in the
     twigs of the sear sweetbrier; but she had the brave sweet faith which nothing kills, and she
     did not doubt — oh! no, she did not doubt, she was only tired.</p>
    <p>Tired of the strange, sleepless, feverish nights; tired of the long, dull, empty days: tired
     of watching down the barren, leafless lane: tired of hearkening breathless to each step on the
     rustling dead leaves; tired of looking always, always, always, into the ruddy autumn evenings
     and the cold autumn starlight, and never hearing what she listened for, never seeing what she
     sought; tired as a child may be lost in a wood, and wearily wearing its small strength and
     breaking its young heart in search of the track forever missed, of the home forever beyond the
     horizon.</p>
    <p>Still she did her work and kept her courage.</p>
    <p>She took her way into the town with her basket full of the ruby and amber of the dusky autumn
     blossoms, and when those failed, and the garden was quite desolate, except for a promise of
     haws and of holly, she went, as she had always done, to the lace-room, and gained her bread and
     the chickens' corn each day by winding the thread round the bobbins; and at nightfall when she
     had plodded home through the darksome roads and over the sodden turf, and had lit her rushlight
     and sat down to her books, with her hand buried in her hair, and her eyes smarting from the
     strain of the lace-work and her heart aching with that new and deadly pain which never left her
     now, she would read — read — read — read, and try and store her brain with knowledge, and try and
     grasp these vast new meanings of life that the books opened to her, and try and grow less
     ignorant against he should return.</p>
    <p>There was much she could not understand, bait there was also much she could.</p>
    <p>Her mind was delicate and quick, her intelligence swift and strong; she bought old books at
     bookstalls with pence that she saved by going without her dinner. The keeper of the stall, a
     shrewd old soul, explained some hard points to her, and chose good volumes for her, and lent
     others to this solitary little student in her wooden shoes and with her pale child's face.</p>
    <p>So she toiled hard and learned much, and grew taller and very thin, and got a look in her
     eyes like a lost dog's, and yet never lost heart or wandered in the task that he had set her,
     or in her faith in his return.</p>
    <p>"Burn the books, Bébée," whispered the children again and again, clinging to her skirts.
     "Burn the wicked, silent things. Since you have had them you never sing, or romp, or laugh, and
     you look so white — so white."</p>
    <p>Bébée kissed them, but kept to her books.</p>
    <p>Jeannot going by from the forest night after night saw the light twinkling in the hut window,
     and sometimes crept softly up and looked through the chinks of the wooden shutter, and saw her
     leaning over some big old volume with her pretty brows drawn together, and her mouth shut close
     in earnest effort, and he would curse the man who had changed her so and go away with rage in
     his breast and tears in his eyes, not daring to say anything, but knowing that never would
     Bébée's little brown hand lie in love within his own.</p>
    <p>Nor even in friendship, for he had rashly spoken rough words against the stranger from Rubes'
     land, and Bébée ever since then had passed him by with a grave, simple greeting, and when he
     had brought her in timid gifts a barrow-load of fagots, had thanked him, but had bidden him
     take the wood home to his mother.</p>
    <p>"You think evil things of me, Bébée?" good Jeannot had pleaded, with a sob in his voice; and
     she had answered gently, — </p>
    <p>"No; but do not speak to me, that is all."</p>
    <p>Then he had cursed her absent lover, and Bébée gone within and closed her door.</p>
    <p>She had no idea that the people thought ill of her. They were cold to her, and such coldness
     made her heart ache a little more. But the one great love in her possessed her so strongly that
     all other things were half unreal.</p>
    <p>She did her daily housework from sheer habit, and she studied because he had told her to do
     it, and because with the sweet, stubborn, credulous faith of her youth, she never doubted that
     he would return.</p>
    <p>Otherwise there was no perception of real life in her; she dreamed and prayed, and prayed and
     dreamed, and never ceased to do either one or the other, even when she was scattering
     potato-peels to the fowls, or shaking carrots loose of the soil, or sweeping the snow from her
     hut door, or going out in the raw dark dawn as the single little sad bell of St. Guido tolled
     through the stillness for the first mass.</p>
    <p>For though even Father Francis looked angered at her because he thought she was stubborn, and
     hid some truth and some shame from him at confession, yet she went resolutely and oftener than
     ever to kneel in the dusty, dusky, crumbling old church, for it was all she could do for him
     who was absent — so she thought — and she did not feel quite so far away from him when she was
     beseeching Christ to have care of his soul and of his body.</p>
    <p>All her pretty dreams were dead.</p>
    <p>She never heard any story in the robin's song, or saw any promise in the sunset clouds, or
     fancied that angels came about her in the night — never now.</p>
    <p>The fields were gray and sad; the birds were little brown things; the stars were cold and far
     off; the people she had used to care for were like mere shadows that went by her meaningless
     and without interest, and all she thought of was the one step that never came: all she wanted
     was the one touch she never felt.</p>
    <p>"You have done wrong, Bébée, and you will not own it," said the few neighbors who ever spoke
     to her.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked at them with wistful, uncomprehending eyes.</p>
    <p>"I have done no wrong," she said gently, but no one believed her.</p>
    <p>A girl did not shut herself up and wane pale and thin for nothing, so they reasoned. She
     might have sinned as she had liked if she had been sensible after it, and married Jeannot.</p>
    <p>But to fret mutely, and shut her lips, and seem as though she had done nothing, — that was
     guilt indeed.</p>
    <p>For her village, in its small way, thought as the big world thinks.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
    <p>Full winter came.</p>
    <p>The snow was deep, and the winds drove the people with whips of ice along the dreary country
     roads and the steep streets of the city. The bells of the dogs and the mules sounded sadly
     through the white misty silence of the Flemish plains, and the weary horses slipped and fell on
     the frozen ruts and on the jagged stones in the little frost-shut Flemish towns. Still the
     Flemish folk were gay enough in many places.</p>
    <p>There were fairs and kermesses; there were puppet plays and church feasts; there were sledges
     on the plains and skates on the canals; there were warm woollen hoods and ruddy wood fires;
     there were tales of demons and saints, and bowls of hot onion soup; sugar images for the little
     children, and blessed beads for the maidens clasped on rosy throats with lovers' kisses; and in
     the city itself there was the high tide of the winter pomp and mirth, with festal scenes in the
     churches, and balls at the palaces, and all manner of gay things in toys and jewels, and music
     playing cheerily under the leafless trees, and flashes of scarlet cloth, and shining furs, and
     happy faces, and golden curls, in the carriages that climbed the Montagne de la Cour, and
     filled the big place around the statue of stout Godfrey.</p>
    <p>In the little village above St. Guido, Bébée's neighbors were merry too, in their simple
     way.</p>
    <p>The women worked away wearily at their lace in the dim winter light, and made a wretched
     living by it, but all the same they got penny playthings for their babies, and a bit of cake
     for their Sunday-hearth. They drew together in homely and cordial friendship, and of an
     afternoon when dusk fell wove their lace in company in Mère Krebs's mill-house kitchen with the
     children and the dogs at their feet on the bricks, so that one big fire might serve for all,
     and all be lighted with one big rush candle, and all be beguiled by chit-chat and songs,
     stories of spirits, and whispers of ghosts, and now and then when the wind howled at its worst,
     a paternoster or two said in common for the men toiling in the barges or drifting up the
     Scheldt.</p>
    <p>In these gatherings Bébée's face was missed, and the blithe soft sound of her voice, like a
     young thrush singing, was never heard.</p>
    <p>The people looked in, and saw her sitting over a great open book; often her hearth had no
     fire.</p>
    <p>Then the children grew tired of asking her to play; and their elders began to shake their
     heads; she was so pale and so quiet, there must be some evil in it — so they began to think.</p>
    <p>Little by little people dropped away from her. Who knew, the gossips said, what shame or sin
     the child might not have on her sick little soul?</p>
    <p>True, Bébée worked hard just the same, and just the same was seen trudging to and fro in the
     dusk of dawns and afternoons in her two little wooden shoes. She was gentle and laborious, and
     gave the children her goat's milk, and the old women the brambles of her garden.</p>
    <p>But they grew afraid of her — afraid of that sad, changeless, far-away look in her eves, and of
     the mute weariness that was on her — and, being perplexed, were sure, like all ignorant
     creatures, that what was secret must be also vile.</p>
    <p>So they hung aloof, and let her alone, and by and by scarcely nodded as they passed her but
     said to Jeannot, — </p>
    <p>"You were spared a bad thing, lad: the child was that grand painter's light-o'-love, that is
     plain to see. The mischief all comes of the stuff old Antoine filled her head with — a stray
     little by-blow of chickweed that he cockered up like a rare carnation. Oh! do not fly in a
     rage, Jeannot; the child is no good, and would have made an honest man rue. Take heart of
     grace, and praise the saints, and marry Katto's Lisa."</p>
    <p>But Jeannot would never listen to the slanderers, and would never look at Lisa, even though
     the door of the little hut was always closed against him; and whenever he met Bébée on the
     highway she never seemed to see him more than she saw the snow that her sabots were
     treading.</p>
    <p>One night in the midwinter-time old Annémie died.</p>
    <p>Bébée found her in the twilight with her head against the garret window, and her left side
     all shrivelled and useless. She had a little sense left, and a few fleeting breaths to
     draw.</p>
    <p>"Look for the brig," she muttered. "You will not see the flag at the masthead for the fog
     to-night; but his socks are dry and his pipe is ready. Keep looking — keep looking — she will be in
     port to-night."</p>
    <p>But her dead sailor never came into port; she went to him. The poor, weakened, faithful old
     body of her was laid in the graveyard of the poor, and the ships came and went under the empty
     garret window, and Bébée was all alone.</p>
    <p>She had no more anything to work for, or any bond with the lives of others. She could live on
     the roots of her garden and the sale of her hens' eggs, and she could change the turnips and
     carrots that grew in a little strip of her ground for the quantity of bread that she
     needed.</p>
    <p>So she gave herself up to the books, and drew herself more and more within from the outer
     world. She did not know that the neighbors thought very evil of her; she had only one idea in
     her mind — to be more worthy of him against he should return.</p>
    <p>The winter passed away somehow, she did not know how.</p>
    <p>It was a long, cold, white blank of frozen silence: that was all. She studied hard, and had
     got a quaint, strange, deep, scattered knowledge out of her old books; her face had lost all
     its roundness and color, but, instead, the forehead had gained breadth and the eyes had the dim
     fire of a student's.</p>
    <p>Every night when she shut her volumes she thought, — </p>
    <p>"I am a little nearer him. I know a little more."</p>
    <p>Just so every morning, when she bathed her hands in the chilly water, she thought to herself,
     "I will make my skin as soft as I can for him, that it may be like the ladies' he has
     loved."</p>
    <p>Love to be perfect must be a religion, as well as a passion. Bébée's was so. Like George
     Herbert's serving-maiden, she swept no specks of dirt away from a floor without doing it to the
     service of her lord.</p>
    <p>Only Bébée's lord was a king of earth, made of earth's dust and vanities.</p>
    <p>But what did she know of that?</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
    <p>The winter went by, and the snow-drops and crocus and pale hepatica smiled at her from the
     black clods. Every other springtime Bébée had run with fleet feet under the budding trees down
     into the city, and had sold sweet little wet bunches of violets and brier before all the snow
     was melted from the eaves of the Broodhuis.</p>
    <p>"The winter is gone," the townspeople used to say; "look, there is Bébée with the
     flowers."</p>
    <p>But this year they did not see the little figure itself like a rosy crocus standing against
     the brown timbers of the Maison de Roi.</p>
    <p>Bébée had not heart to pluck a single blossom of them all. She let them all live, and tended
     them so that the little garden should look its best and brightest to him when his hand should
     lift its latch.</p>
    <p>Only he was so long coming — so very long; the violets died away, and the first rosebuds came
     in their stead, and still Bébée looked every dawn and every nightfall vainly down the empty
     road.</p>
    <p>Nothing kills young creatures like the bitterness of waiting.</p>
    <p>Pain they will bear, and privation they will pass through, fire and water and storm will not
     appall them, nor wrath of heaven and earth, but waiting — the long, tedious, sickly, friendless
     days, that drop one by one in their eternal sameness into the weary past, these kill slowly but
     surely, as the slow dropping of water frets away rock.</p>
    <p>The summer came.</p>
    <p>Nearly a year had gone by. Bébée worked early and late. The garden bloomed like one big rose,
     and the neighbors shook their heads to see the flowers blossom and fall without bringing in a
     single coin.</p>
    <p>She herself spoke less seldom than ever; and now when old Jehan, who never had understood the
     evil thoughts of his neighbors, asked her what ailed her that she looked so pale and never
     stirred down to the city, now her courage failed her, and the tears brimmed over her eyes, and
     she could not call up a brave brief word to answer him. For the time was so long, and she was
     so tired.</p>
    <p>Still she never doubted that her lover would comeback: he had said he would come: she was as
     sure that he would come as she was sure that God came in the midst of the people when the
     silver bell rang and the Host was borne by on high.</p>
    <p>Bébée did not heed much, but she vaguely-felt the isolation she was left in: as a child too
     young to reason feels cold and feels hunger.</p>
    <p>"No one wants me here now that Annémie is gone," she thought to herself, as the sweet green
     spring days unfolded themselves one by one like the buds of the brier-rose hedges.</p>
    <p>And now and then even the loyal little soul of her gave way, and sobbing on her lonely bed in
     the long dark nights, she would cry out against him, "Oh, why not have left me alone? I was so
     happy — so happy!"</p>
    <p>And then she would reproach herself with treason to him and ingratitude, and hate herself and
     feel guilty in her own sight to have thus sinned against him in thought for one single
     instant.</p>
    <p>For there are natures in which the generosity of love is so strong that it feels its own just
     pain to be disloyalty; and Bébée's was one of them. And if he had killed her she would have
     died hoping only that no moan had escaped her under the blow that ever could accuse him.</p>
    <p>These natures, utterly innocent by force of self-accusation and self-abasement, suffer at
     once the torment of the victim and the criminal.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
    <p>One day in the May weather she sat within doors with a great book upon her table, but no
     sight for it in her aching eyes. The starling hopped to and fro on the sunny floor; the bees
     boomed in the porch; the tinkle of sheep's bells came in on the stillness. All was peaceful and
     happy except the little weary, breaking, desolate heart that beat in her like a caged
     bird's.</p>
    <p>"He will come; I am sure he will come," she said to herself; but she was so tired, and it was
     so long — oh, dear God! — so very long.</p>
    <p>A hand tapped at the lattice. The shrill voice of Reine, the sabot-maker's wife, broken with
     anguish, called through the hanging ivy, — </p>
    <p>"Bébée, you are a wicked one, they say, but the only one there is at home in the village this
     day. Get you to town for the love of Heaven, and send Doctor Max hither, for my pet, my flower,
     my child lies dying, and not a soul near, and she black as a coal with choking — go, go, go! — and
     Mary will forgive you your sins. Save the little one, dear Bébée, do you hear? and I will pray
     God and speak fair the neighbors for you. Go!"</p>
    <p>Bébée rose up, startled by the now unfamiliar sound of a human voice, and looked at the
     breathless mother with eyes of pitying wonder.</p>
    <p>"Surely I will go," she said, gently; "but there is no need to bribe me. I have not sinned
     greatly — that I know."</p>
    <p>Then she went out quickly and ran through the lanes and into the city for the sick child, and
     found the wise man, and sent him, and did the errand rather in a sort of sorrowful sympathetic
     instinct than in any reasoning consciousness of doing good.</p>
    <p>When she was moving through the once familiar and happy ways as the sun was setting on the
     golden fronts of the old houses, and the chimes were ringing from the many towers, a strange
     sense of unreality, of non-existence, fell upon her.</p>
    <p>Could it be she? — she indeed — who had gone there the year before the gladdest thing that the
     earth bore, with no care except to shelter her flowers from the wind, and keep the freshest
     blossoms for the burgomaster's housewife?</p>
    <p>She did not think thus to herself; but a vague doubt that she could ever have been the little
     gay, laborious, happy Bébée, with troops of friends and endless joys for every day that dawned,
     came over her as she went by the black front of the Broodhuis.</p>
    <p>The strong voice of Lisa, the fruit girl, jarred on her as she passed the stall under its
     yellow awning that was flapping sullenly in the evening wind.</p>
    <p>"Oh hé, little fool," the mocking voice cried, "the rind of the fine pine is full of
     prickles, and stings the lips when the taste is gone? — to be sure — crack common nuts like me and
     you are never wanting — hazels grow free in every copse. Prut, tut! your grand lover lies
     a-dying; so the students read out of this just now; and you such a simpleton as not to get a
     roll of napoleons out of him before he went to rot in Paris. I dare say he was poor as
     sparrows, if one knew the truth. He was only a painter after all."</p>
    <p>Lisa tossed her as she spoke a torn sheet, in which she was wrapping gentians: it was a piece
     of newspaper some three weeks old, and in it there was a single line or so which said that the
     artist Flamen, whose Gretchen was the wonder of the Salon of the year, lay sick unto death in
     his rooms in Paris.</p>
    <p>Bébée stood and read; the strong ruddy western light upon the type, the taunting laughter of
     the fruit girl on her ear.</p>
    <p>A bitter shriek rang from her that made even the cruelty of Lisa's mirth stop in a sudden
     terror.</p>
    <p>She stood staring like a thing changed to stone down on the one name that to her rilled all
     the universe.</p>
    <p>"Ill — he is ill — do you hear?" she echoed piteously, looking at Lisa; "and you say he is
     poor?"</p>
    <p>"Poor? for sure! is he not a painter?" said the fruit girl, roughly. She judged by her own
     penniless student lads; and she was angered with herself for feeling sorrow for this little
     silly thing that she had loved to torture.</p>
    <p>"You have been bad and base to me; but now — I bless you, I love you, I will pray for you,"
     said Bébée, in a swift broken breath, and with a look upon her face that startled into pain her
     callous enemy.</p>
    <p>Then without another word, she thrust the paper in her bosom, and ran out of the square
     breathless with haste and with a great resolve.</p>
    <p>He was ill — and he was poor! The brave little soul of her leaped at once to action. He was
     sick, and far away; and poor they said. All danger and all difficulty faded to nothing before
     the vision of his need.</p>
    <p>Bébée was only a little foundling who ran about in wooden shoes; but she had the "dog's soul"
     in her — the soul that will follow faithfully though to receive a curse, that will defend loyally
     though to meet a blow, and that will die mutely loving to the last.</p>
    <p>She went home, how she never knew; and without the delay of a moment packed up a change of
     linen, and fed the fowls and took the key of the hut down to old Jehan's cabin. The old man was
     only half-witted by reason of his affliction for his dead daughter, but he was shrewd enough to
     understand what she wanted of him, and honest enough to do it.</p>
    <p>"I am going into the city," she said to him: "and if I am not back to-night, will you feed
     the starling and the hens, and water the flowers for me?"</p>
    <p>Old Jehan put his head out of his lattice: it was seven in the evening, and he was going to
     bed.</p>
    <p>"What are you after, little one?" he asked: going to show the fine buckles at a students'
     ball? Nay, fie; that is not like you."</p>
    <p>"I am going to — pray — dear Jehan," she answered, with a sob in her throat and the first
     falsehood she ever had told. "Do what I ask you — do for your dead daughter's sake — or the birds
     and the flowers will die of hunger and thirst. Take the key and promise me."</p>
    <p>He took the key, and promised.</p>
    <p>"Do not let them see those buckles shine; they will rob you," he added.</p>
    <p>Bébée ran from him fast; every moment that was lost was so precious and so terrible. To pause
     a second for fear's sake never occurred to her. She went forth as fearlessly as a young
     swallow, born in northern April days, flies forth on instinct to new lands and over unknown
     seas when autumn falls.</p>
    <p>Necessity and action breathed new life into her. The hardy and brave peasant ways of her were
     awoke once more. She had been strong to wait silently with the young life in her dying out drop
     by drop in the heart-sickness of long delay. She was strong now to throw herself into strange
     countries and dim perils and immeasurable miseries, on the sole chance that she might be of
     service to him.</p>
    <p>A few human souls here and there can love like dogs. Bébée's was one.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
    <p>It was dark. The May days are short in the north lands of the Scheldt.</p>
    <p>She had her little winter cloak of frieze and her wooden shoes and her little white cap with
     the sunny curls rippling out of it in their pretty rebellion. She had her little lantern too;
     and her bundle, and she had put a few fresh eggs in her basket, with some sweet herbs and the
     palm-sheaf that Father Francis had blessed last Easter; for who could tell, she thought, how
     ill he might not be, or how poor?</p>
    <p>She hardly gave a look to the hut as she ran by its garden gate; all her heart was on in
     front, in the vague far-off country where he lay sick unto death.</p>
    <p>She ran fast through the familiar lanes into the city. She was not very sure where Paris was,
     but she had the name clear and firm, and she knew that people were always coming and going
     thence and thither, so that she had no fear she should not find it.</p>
    <p>She went straight to the big, busy, bewildering place in the Leopold quarter where the iron
     horses fumed every day and night along the iron ways. She had never been there before, but she
     knew it was by that great highway that the traffic to Paris was carried on, and she knew that
     it would carry people also as well.</p>
    <p>There were bells clanging, lights flashing, and crowds pushing and shouting, as she ran up — a
     little gray figure, with the lantern-spark glimmering like any tiny glow-worm astray in a
     gas-lit city.</p>
    <p>"To Paris?" she asked, entreatingly, going where she saw others going, to a little grated
     wicket in a wall.</p>
    <p>"Twenty-seven francs — quick!" they demanded of her. Bébée gave a great cry, and stood still,
     trembling and trying not to sob aloud. She had never thought of money; she had forgotten that
     youth and strength and love and willing feet and piteous prayers, — all went for nothing as this
     world is made.</p>
    <p>A hope flashed on her and a glad thought. She loosed the silver buckles, and held them
     out.</p>
    <p>"Would you take these? They are worth much more."</p>
    <p>There was a derisive laughter; some one bade her with an oath begone; rough shoulders jostled
     her away. She stretched her arms out piteously.</p>
    <p>"Take me — oh, pray take me! I will go with the sheep, with the cattle — only, only take me!"</p>
    <p>But in the rush and roar none heeded her; some thief snatched the silver buckles from her
     hand, and made off with them and was lost in the throng; a great iron beast rushed by her,
     snorting flame and bellowing smoke; there was a roll like thunder, and all was dark; the night
     express had passed on its way to Paris.</p>
    <p>Bébée stood still, crushed for a moment with the noise and the cruelty and the sense of
     absolute desolation; she scarcely noticed that the buckles had been stolen; she had only one
     thought — to get to Paris.</p>
    <p>"Can I never go without money?" she asked at the wicket; the man there glanced a moment, with
     a touch of pity, at the little wistful face.</p>
    <p>"The least is twenty francs — surely you must know that?" he said, and shut his grating with a
     clang.</p>
    <p>Bébée turned away and went out of the great cruel, tumultuous place; her heart ached and her
     brain was giddy, but the sturdy courage of her nature rose to need.</p>
    <p>"There is no way at all to go without money to Paris, I suppose?" she asked of an old woman
     whom she knew a little, who sold nuts and little pictures of saints and wooden playthings under
     the trees, in the avenue hard by.</p>
    <p>The old woman shook her head.</p>
    <p>"Eh? — no, dear. There is nothing to be done anywhere in the world without money. Look, I
     cannot get a litre of nuts to sell unless I pay beforehand."</p>
    <p>"Would it be far to walk?"</p>
    <p>"Far! Holy Jesus! It is right away in the heart of France — over two hundred miles, they say;
     straight out through the forest. Not but what my son did walk it once; — and he a shoemaker, who
     knows what walking costs; and he is well-to-do there now — not that he ever writes. When they
     want nothing people never write."</p>
    <p>"And he walked into Paris?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, ten years ago. He had nothing but a few sous and an ash stick, and he had a fancy to
     try his luck there. And after all our feet were given us to travel with. If you go there and
     you see him, tell him to send me something — I am tired of selling nuts."</p>
    <p>Bébée said nothing, but went on her road; since there was no other way but to walk, she would
     take that way; the distance and the hardship did not appall two little feet that were used to
     traverse so many miles of sun-baked summer dust and of frozen winter mud unblenchingly year
     after year.</p>
    <p>The time it would take made her heart sink indeed. He was ill. God knew what might happen.
     But neither the length of leagues nor the fatigue of body daunted her. She only saw his eyes
     dim with pain and his lips burned with fever.</p>
    <p>She would walk twenty miles a day, and then, perhaps, she might get lifts here and there on
     hay wagons or in pedlers' carts; people had always used to be kind to her. Anyhow she counted
     she might reach Paris well in fifteen days.</p>
    <p>She sat under a shrine in a by street a moment, and counted the copper pieces she had on her;
     they were few, and the poor pretty buckles that she might have sold to get money were
     stolen.</p>
    <p>She had some twenty sous and a dozen eggs; she thought she might live on that; she had wanted
     to take the eggs to him, but after all, to keep life in her until she could reach Paris was the
     one great thing.</p>
    <p>"What a blessing it is to have been born poor; and to have lived hardly — one wants so little!"
     she thought to herself.</p>
    <p>Then she put up the sous in the linen bosom of her gown, and trimmed her little lantern and
     knelt down in the quiet darkness and prayed a moment, with the hot agonized tears rolling down
     her face, and then rose and stepped out bravely in the cool of the night, on the great
     southwest road towards Paris.</p>
    <p>The thought never once crossed her to turn back, and go again into the shelter of her own
     little hut among the flowers. He was sick there, dying, for anything she knew; that was the
     only thing she remembered.</p>
    <p>It was a clear, starlit night, and everywhere the fragrance of the spring was borne in from
     the wide green plains, and the streams where the rushes were blowing.</p>
    <p>She walked ten miles easily, the beautiful gray shadow all about her. She had never been so
     far from home in all her life, except to that one Kermesse at Mechlin. But she was not
     afraid.</p>
    <p>With the movement, and the air, and the sense that she was going to him, which made her happy
     even in her misery, something of the old, sweet, lost fancies came to her.</p>
    <p>She smiled at the stars through her tears, and as the poplars swayed and murmured in the
     wind, they looked to her like the wings and the swords of a host of angels.</p>
    <p>Her way lay out through the forest, and in that sweet green woodland she was not afraid — no
     more afraid than the fawns were.</p>
    <p>At Boitsfort she shrank a little, indeed. Here there were the open-air restaurants, and the
     café gardens all alight for the pleasure-seekers from the city; here there were music and
     laughter, and horses with brass bells, and bright colors on high in the wooden balconies, and
     below among the blossoming hawthorn hedges. She had to go through it all, and she shuddered a
     little as she ran, thinking of that one priceless, deathless forest day when he had kissed her
     first.</p>
    <p>But the pleasure-people were all busied with their mirth and mischief, and took no notice of
     the little gray figure in the starry night. She went on along the grassy roads, under the high
     arching trees, with the hoot of the owls and the cry of the rabbits on the stillness.</p>
    <p>At Groenendael, in the heart of the forest midnight was striking as she entered the village.
     Every one was asleep. The lights were all out The old ruined priory frowned dark under the
     clouds.</p>
    <p>She shivered a little again, and began to feel chill and tired, yet did not dare to knock at
     any one of the closed house doors — she had no money.</p>
    <p>So she walked on her first ten unknown miles, meeting a few people only, and being altogether
     unmolested — a small gray figure, trotting in two little wooden shoes.</p>
    <p>They thought her a peasant going to a fair or a lace mill, and no one did her more harm than
     to wish her good night in rough Flemish.</p>
    <p>When the dawn began to whiten above the plains of the east, she saw an empty cow-shed filled
     with hay; she was a little tired, and lay down and rested an hour or two, as a young lamb might
     have lain on the dried clover, for she knew that she must keep her strength and husband her
     power, or never reach across the dreary length of the foreign land to Paris.</p>
    <p>But by full sunrise she was on her way again, bathing her face in a brook and buying a sou's
     worth of bread and flet-milk at the first cottage that she passed in bright, leaf-bowered
     Hoey-laert.</p>
    <p>The forest was still all around her, with its exquisite life of bough and blossom, and murmur
     of insect and of bird. She told her beads, praying as she went, and was almost happy.</p>
    <p>God would not let him die. Oh, no, not till she had kissed him once more, and could die with
     him.</p>
    <p>The hares ran across the path, and the blue butterflies flew above-head. There was purple
     gloom of pine wood, and sparkling verdure of aspen and elm. There were distant church carillons
     ringing, and straight golden shafts of sunshine streaming.</p>
    <p>She was quite sure God would not let him die.</p>
    <p>She hoped that he might be very poor. At times he had talked as if he were, and then she
     might be of so much use. She knew how to deal with fever and suffering. She had sat up many a
     night with the children of the village. The gray sisters had taught her many of their ways of
     battling with disease; and she could make fresh cool drinks, and she could brew beautiful
     remedies from simple herbs. There was so much that she might do; her fancy played with it
     almost happily. And then, only to touch his hand, only to hear his voice; her heart rose at the
     thought, as a lark to its morning song.</p>
    <p>At Rixensart, buried in its greenery, as she went through it in morning light, some peasants
     greeted her cheerily, and called to her to rest in a house porch, and gave her honey and bread.
     She could not eat much; her tongue was parched and her throat was dry, but the kindness was
     precious to her, and she went on her road the stronger for it.</p>
    <p>"It is a long way to walk to Paris," said the woman, with some curious wonder. Bébée smiled,
     though her eyes grew wet.</p>
    <p>"She has the look of the little Gesù," said the Rixensart people; and they watched her away
     with a vague timid pity.</p>
    <p>So she went on through Ottignies and La Roche to Villers, and left the great woods and the
     city chimes behind her, and came through the green abbey valleys through Tilly and Ligny, and
     Fleurus, and so into the coal and iron fields that lie round Charleroi.</p>
    <p>Here her heart grew sick, and her courage sank under the noise and the haste, before the
     blackness and the hideousness. She had never seen anything like it. She thought it was hell,
     with the naked, swearing, fighting people, and the red fires leaping night and day.
     Nevertheless, if hell it were, since it lay betwixt her and him, she found force to brave and
     cross it.</p>
    <p>The miners and glass-blowers and nail-makers, rough and fierce and hard, frightened her. The
     women did not look like women, and the children ran and yelled at her, and set their dogs upon
     her. The soil was thick with dust like soot, and the trees were seared and brown. There was no
     peace in the place, and no loveliness. Eighty thousand folks toiled together in the hopeless
     Tophet, and swarmed, and struggled, and labored, and multiplied, in joyless and endless
     wrestling against hunger and death.</p>
    <p>She got through it somehow, hiding often from the ferocious youngsters, and going sleepless
     rather than lie in those dens of filth; but she seemed so many, many years older when Charleroi
     lay at last behind her, — so many, many years older than when she had sat and spun in the garden
     at home.</p>
    <p>When she was once in the valley of the Sambre she was more herself again, only she felt
     weaker than she had ever done, because she only dared to spend one of her sous each day, and
     one sou got so little food.</p>
    <p>In the woods and fields about Alne she began to breathe again, like a bird loosed to the air
     after being shut in a wooden trap. Green corn, green boughs, green turf, mellow chimes of
     church bells, humming of golden bees, cradle songs of women spinning, homely odors of little
     herb gardens and of orchard trees under cottage walls, — these had been around her all her life;
     she only breathed freely among them.</p>
    <p>She often felt tired, and her wooden shoes were wearing so thin that the hot dust of the road
     at noonday burnt her feet through them. Sometimes, too, she felt a curious brief faintness,
     such as she had never known, for the lack of food and the long fatigue began to tell even on
     her hardy little body.</p>
    <p>But she went on bravely, rarely doing less than her twenty miles a day, and sometimes more,
     walking often in the night to save time, and lying down in cow-sheds or under haystacks in the
     noontide.</p>
    <p>For the most part people were kind to her; they saw she was so very young and so poor.</p>
    <p>Women would give her leave to bathe herself in their bedchambers, and children would ask her
     to wait on the village bench under the chestnut-tree, while they brought her their pet lamb or
     their tumbler pigeons to look at, but, for the most part — unless she was very, very tired — she
     would not wait. It took her so long, and who could tell how it fared with him in Paris?</p>
    <p>Into the little churches, scattered over the wide countries between Charleroi and
     Erquelinnes, she would turn aside, indeed; but, then, that was only to say a prayer for him;
     that was not loss to him, but gain.</p>
    <p>So she walked on until she reached the frontier of France. She began to get a little giddy;
     she began to see the blue sky and the green level always swirling round her as if some one were
     spinning them to frighten her, but still she would not be afraid; she went on, and on, and on,
     till she set her last step on the soil of Flanders.</p>
    <p>Here a new, strange, terrible, incomprehensible obstacle opposed her: she had no papers; they
     thrust her back and spoke to her as if she were a criminal. She could not understand what they
     could mean. She had never heard of these laws and rules. She vaguely comprehended that she must
     not enter France, and stunned and heartbroken she dropped down under a tree, and for the first
     time sobbed as if her very life would weep itself away.</p>
    <p>She could see nothing, understand nothing. There were the same road, the same hedges, the
     same fields, the same white cottages, and peasants in blue shirts and dun-hued oxen in the
     wagons. She saw no mark, no difference, ere they told her where she stood was Belgium, and
     where they stood was France, and that she must not pass from one into the other.</p>
    <p>The men took no notice of her. They went back into their guard-house, and smoked and drank. A
     cat sunned herself under a scarlet bean. The white clouds sailed on before a southerly sky. She
     might die here — he there — and nothing seemed to care.</p>
    <p>After a while an old hawker came up; he was travelling with wooden clocks from the Black
     Forest. He stopped and looked at her, and asked her what she ailed.</p>
    <p>She knelt down at his feet in the dust.</p>
    <p>"Oh, help me!" she cried to him. "Oh, pray, help me! I have walked all the way from
     Brussels — that is my country — and now they will not let me pass that house where the soldiers
     are. They say I have no papers. What papers should I have? I do not know. When one has done no
     harm, and does not owe a sou anywhere, and has walked all the way — Is it money that they want? I
     have none; and they stole my silver clasps in Brussels; and if I do not get to Paris I must
     die — die without seeing him again — ever again, dear God!"</p>
    <p>She dropped her head upon the dust and crouched and sobbed there, her courage broken by this
     new barrier that she had never dreamed would come between herself and Paris.</p>
    <p>The old hawker looked at her thoughtfully. He had seen much of men and women, and knew truth
     from counterfeit, and he was moved by the child's agony.</p>
    <p>He stooped and whispered in her ear, — </p>
    <p>"Get up quick, and I will pass you. It is against the law, and I may go to prison for it.
     Never mind; one must risk something in this world, or else be a cur. My daughter has stayed
     behind in Marbais sweethearting; her name is on my passport, and her age and face will do for
     yours. Get up and follow me close, and I will get you through. Poor little soul! Whatever your
     woe is it is real enough, and you are such a young and pretty thing. Get up, the guards are in
     their house, they have not seen; follow me, and you must not speak a word; they must take you
     for a German, dumb as wood."</p>
    <p>She got up and obeyed him, not comprehending, but only vaguely seeing that he was friendly to
     her, and would pass her over into France.</p>
    <p>The old man made a little comedy at the barrier, and scolded her as though she were his
     daughter for losing her way as she came to meet him, and then crying like a baby.</p>
    <p>The guards looked at her carelessly, joked the hawker on her pretty face, looked the papers
     over, and let her through, believing her the child of the clock-maker of the Hartz. Some lies
     are blessed as truth.</p>
    <p>"I have done wrong in the law, but not before God, I think, little one," said the pedler.
     "Nay, do not thank me, or go on like that; we are in sight of the customs men still, and if
     they suspected, it would be the four walls of a cell only that you and I should see to-night.
     And now tell me your story, poor maiden: why are you on foot through a strange country?"</p>
    <p>But Bébée would not tell him her story: she was confused and dazed still. She did not know
     rightly what had happened to her; but she could not talk of herself, nor of why she travelled
     thus to Paris.</p>
    <p>The old hawker got cross at her silence, and called her an unthankful jade, and wished that
     he had left her to her fate, and parted company with her at two cross-roads, saying his path
     did not lie with hers; and then when he had done that, was sorry, and being a tenderhearted
     soul, hobbled back, and would fain press a five-franc piece on her; and Bébée, refusing it all
     the while, kissed his old brown hands and blessed him, and broke away from him, and so went on
     again solitary towards St. Quentin.</p>
    <p>The country was very flat and poor, and yet the plains had a likeness in them to her own wide
     Brabant downs, where the tall green wheat was blowing and the barges dropping down the sluggish
     streams.</p>
    <p>She was very footsore; very weary; very hungry so often; but she was in France — in his
     country; and her spirit rose with the sense of that nearness to him.</p>
    <p>After all, God was so good to her; there were fine bright days and nights; a few showers had
     fallen, but merely passing ones; the air was so cool and so balmy that it served her almost as
     food; and she seldom found people so unkind that they refused for her single little sou to give
     her a crust of bread and let her lie in an outhouse.</p>
    <p>After all, God was very good; and by the sixteenth or seventeenth day she would be in the
     city of Paris.</p>
    <p>She was a little light-headed at times from insufficient nourishment: especially after waking
     from strange dreams in unfamiliar places; sometimes the soil felt tremulous under her, and the
     sky spun round; but she struggled against the feeling, and kept a brave heart, and tried to be
     afraid of nothing.</p>
    <p>Sometimes at night she thought she saw old Annémie. "But what if I do?" she said to herself;
     "Annémie never will hurt me."</p>
    <p>And now, as she grew nearer her goal, her natural buoyancy of spirit returned as it had never
     done to her since the evening that he had kissed and left her. As her body grew lighter and
     more exhausted, her fancy grew keener and more dominant. All things of the earth and air spoke
     to her as she went along as they had used to do. All that she had learned from the books in the
     long cold months came to her clear and wonderful. She was not so very ignorant now — ignorant,
     indeed, beside him — but still knowing something that would make her able to read to him if he
     liked it, and to understand if he talked of grave things.</p>
    <p>She had no fixed thought of what she would be to him when she reached him.</p>
    <p>She fancied she would wait on him, and tend him, and make him well, and be caressed by him,
     and get all gracious pretty things of leaf and blossom about him, and kneel at his feet, and be
     quite happy if he only touched her now and then with his lips; — her thoughts went no further
     than that; — her love for him was of that intensity and absorption in which nothing But itself is
     remembered.</p>
    <p>When a creature loves much, even when it is as little and as simple a soul as Bébée, the
     world and all its people and all its laws and ways are as naught. They cease to exist; they are
     as though they had never been.</p>
    <p>Whoever recollects an outside world may play with passion, or may idle with sentiment, but
     does not love.</p>
    <p>She did not hear what the villagers said to her. She did not see the streets of the towns as
     she passed them. She kept herself clean always, and broke fast now and then by sheer instinct
     of habit, nothing more. She had no perception what she did, except of walking — walking — walking
     always, and seeing the white road go by like pale ribbons unrolled.</p>
    <p>She got a dreamy, intense, sleepless light in her blue eyes that frightened some of those she
     passed. They thought she had been fever-stricken, and was not in her senses.</p>
    <p>So she went across the dreary lowlands, wearing out her little sabots, but not wearing out
     her patience and her courage.</p>
    <p>She was very dusty and jaded. Her woollen skirt was stained with weather and torn with
     briers. But she had managed always to wash her cap white in brook water, and she had managed
     always to keep her pretty bright curls soft and silken — for he had liked them so much, and he
     would soon draw them through his hand again. So she told herself a thousand times to give her
     strength when the mist would come over her sight, and the earth would seem to tremble as she
     went. On the fifteenth day from the night when she had left her hut by the swans' water, Bébée
     saw Paris.</p>
    <p>Shining away in the sun; white and gold; among woods and gardens she saw Paris.</p>
    <p>She was so tired — oh, so tired — but she could not rest now. There were bells ringing always in
     her ears, and a heavy pain always in her head. But what of that? — she was so near to him.</p>
    <p>"Are you ill, you little thing?" a woman asked her who was gathering early cherries in the
     outskirts of the great city.</p>
    <p>Bébée looked at her and smiled: "I do not know — I am happy."</p>
    <p>And she went onward.</p>
    <p>It was evening. The sun had set. She had not eaten for twenty-four hours. But she could not
     pause for anything now. She crossed the gleaming river, and she heard the cathedral chimes.
     Paris in all its glory was about her, but she took no more note of it than a pigeon that flies
     through it intent on reaching home.</p>
    <p>No one looked at or stopped her; a little dusty peasant with a bundle on a stick over her
     shoulder.</p>
    <p>The click-clack of her wooden shoes on the hot pavements made none look up; little rustics
     came up every day like this to make their fortunes in Paris. Some grew into golden painted
     silken flowers, the convolvuli of their brief summer days; and some drifted into the Seine
     water, rusted, wind-tossed, fallen leaves, that were wanted of no man. Anyhow it was so common
     to see them, pretty but homely things, with their noisy shoes and their little all in a bundle,
     that no one even looked once at Bébée.</p>
    <p>She was not bewildered. As she had gone through her own city, only thinking of the roses in
     her basket and of old Annémie in her garret, so she went through Paris, only thinking of him
     for whose sake she had come thither.</p>
    <p>Now that she was really in his home she was happy, — happy though her head ached with that dull
     odd pain, and all the sunny glare went round and round like a great gilded humming-top, such as
     the babies clapped their hands at, at the Kermesse.</p>
    <p>She was happy: she felt sure now that God would not let him die till she got to him. She was
     quite glad that he had left her all that long, terrible winter, for she had learned so much and
     was so much more fitted to be with him.</p>
    <p>Weary as she was, and strange as the pain in her head made her feel, she was happy, very
     happy; a warm flush came on her little pale cheeks as she thought how soon he would kiss them,
     her whole body thrilled with the old sweet nameless joy that she had sickened for in vain so
     long.</p>
    <p>Though she saw nothing else that was around her, she saw some little knots of moss-roses that
     a girl was selling on the quay, as she used to sell them in front of the Maison du Roi. She had
     only two sous left, but she stopped and bought two little rosebuds to take to him. He had used
     to care for them so much in the summer in Brabant.</p>
    <p>The girl who sold them told her the way to the street he lived in; it was not very far of the
     quay. She seemed to float on air, to have wings like the swallows, to hear beautiful musk all
     around. She felt for her beads, and said aves of praise. God was so good.</p>
    <p>It was quite night when she reached the street, and sought the number of his house. She spoke
     his name softly, and trembling very much with joy, not with any fear, but it seemed to her too
     sacred a thing ever to utter aloud.</p>
    <p>An old man looked out of a den by the door, and told her to go straight up the stairs to the
     third floor, and then turn to the right. The old man chuckled as he glanced after her, and
     listened to the wooden shoes pattering wearily up the broad stone steps.</p>
    <p>Bébée climbed them — ten, twenty, thirty, forty. "He must be very poor!" she thought, "to live
     so high"; and yet the place was wide and handsome, and had a look of riches. Her heart beat so
     fast, she felt suffocated; her limbs shook, her eyes had a red blood-like mist floating before
     them; but she thanked God each step she climbed; a moment, and she would look upon the only
     face she loved.</p>
    <p>"He will be glad; oh, I am sure he will be glad!" she said to herself, as a fear that had
     never before come near her touched her for a moment — if he should not care?</p>
    <p>But even then, what did it matter? Since he was ill she should be there to watch him night
     and day; and when he was well again, if he should wish her to go away — one could always die.</p>
    <p>"But he will be glad — oh, I know he will be glad!" she said to the rosebuds that she carried
     to him. "And if God will only let me save his life, what else do I want more?"</p>
    <p>His name was written on a door before her. The handle of a bell hung down; she pulled it
     timidly. The door unclosed; she saw no one, and went through. There were low lights burning.
     There were heavy scents that were strange to her. There was a fantastic gloom from old armor,
     and old weapons, and old pictures in the dull rich chambers. The sound of her wooden shoes was
     lost in the softness and thickness of the carpets.</p>
    <p>It was not the home of a poor man. A great terror froze her heart, — if she were not wanted
     here?</p>
    <p>She went quickly through three rooms, seeing no one and at the end of the third there were
     folding doors.</p>
    <p>"It is I — Bébée." she said softly, as she pushed them gently apart; and she held out the two
     moss-rosebuds.</p>
    <p>Then the words died on her lips, and a great horror froze her, still and silent, there.</p>
    <p>She saw the dusky room as in a dream. She saw him stretched on the bed, leaning on his elbow,
     laughing, and playing cards upon the lace coverlet. She saw women with loose shining hair and
     bare limbs, and rubies and diamonds glimmering red and white. She saw men lying about upon the
     couch, throwing dice and drinking and laughing one with another.</p>
    <p>Beyond all she saw against the pillows of his bed a beautiful brown wicked looking thing like
     some velvet snake, who leaned over him as he threw down the painted cards upon the lace, and
     who had cast about his throat her curved bare arm with the great coils of dead gold all
     a-glitter on it.</p>
    <p>And above it all there were odors of wines and flowers, clouds of smoke, shouts of laughter,
     music of shrill gay voices.</p>
    <p>She stood like a frozen creature and saw — the rosebuds' in her hand. Then with a great
     piercing cry she let the little roses fall, and turned and fled. At the sound he looked up and
     saw her, and shook his beautiful brown harlot off him with an oath.</p>
    <p>But Bébée flew down through the empty chambers and the long stairway as a hare flies from the
     hounds; her tired feet never paused, her aching limbs never slackened; she ran on, and on, and
     on, into the lighted streets, into the fresh night air; on, and on, and on, straight to the
     river.</p>
    <p>From its brink some man's strength caught and held her. She struggled with it.</p>
    <p>"Let me die! let me die!" she shrieked to him, and strained from him to get at the cool gray
     silent water that waited for her there.</p>
    <p>Then she lost all consciousness, and saw the stars no more.</p>
    <p>When she came back to any sense of life, the stars were shining still, and the face of
     Jeannot was bending over her, wet with tears.</p>
    <p>He had followed her to Paris when they had missed her first, and had come straight by train
     to the city, making sure it was thither she had come, and there had sought her many days,
     watching for her by the house of Flamen.</p>
    <p>She shuddered away from him as he held her, and looked at him with blank, tearless eyes.</p>
    <p>"Do not touch me — take me home."</p>
    <p>That was all she ever said to him. She never asked him or told him anything. She never
     noticed that it was strange that he should have been here upon the river-bank. He let her be,
     and took her silently in the cool night back by the iron ways to Brabant.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
    <p>She sat quite still and upright in the wagon with the dark lands rushing by her. She never
     spoke at all. She had a look that frightened him upon her face. When he tried to touch her
     hand, she shivered away from him.</p>
    <p>The charcoal-burner, hardy and strong among forest-reared men, cowered like a child in a
     corner, and covered his eyes and wept.</p>
    <p>So the night wore away.</p>
    <p>She had no perception of anything that happened to her until she was led through her own
     little garden in the early day, and her starling cried to her, "Bonjour, Bonjour!" Even then
     she only looked about her in a bewildered way, and never spoke.</p>
    <p>Were the sixteen days a dream?</p>
    <p>She did not know.</p>
    <p>The women whom Jeannot summoned, his mother and sisters, and Mère Krebs, and one or two
     others, weeping for what had been the hardness of their hearts against her, undressed her, and
     laid her down on her little bed, and opened the shutters to the radiance of the sun.</p>
    <p>She let them do as they liked, only she seemed neither to hear nor speak, and she never
     spoke.</p>
    <p>All that Jeannot could tell was that he had found her in Paris, and had saved her from the
     river.</p>
    <p>The women were sorrowful, and reproached themselves. Perhaps she had done wrong, but they had
     been harsh, and she was so young.</p>
    <p>The two little sabots with the holes worn through the soles touched them; and they blamed
     themselves for having shut their hearts and their doors against her as they saw the fixed blue
     eyes, without any light in them, and the pretty mouth closed close against either sob or
     smile.</p>
    <p>After all she was Bébée — the little bright blithe thing that had danced with their children,
     and sung to their singing, and brought them always the first roses of the year. If she had been
     led astray, they should have been gentler with her.</p>
    <p>So they told themselves and each other.</p>
    <p>What had she seen in that terrible Paris to change her like this? — they could not tell She
     never spoke.</p>
    <p>The cock crowed gayly to the sun. The lamb bleated in the meadow. The bees boomed among the
     pear-tree blossoms. The gray lavender blew in the open house door. The green leaves threw
     shifting shadows on the floor.</p>
    <p>All things were just the same as they had been the year before, when she had woke to the joy
     of being a girl of sixteen.</p>
    <p>But Bébée now lay quite still and silent on her little bed; as quiet as the waxen Gesù that
     they laid in the manger at the Nativity.</p>
    <p>"If she would only speak!" the women and the children wailed, weeping sorely.</p>
    <p>But she never spoke; nor did she seem to know any one of them. Not even the starling as he
     flew on her pillow and called her.</p>
    <p>"Give her rest," they all said; and one by one moved away, being poor folk and hard working,
     and unable to lose a whole day.</p>
    <p>Mère Krebs stayed with her, and Jeannot sat in the porch where her little spinning-wheel
     stood, and rocked himself to and fro; in vain agony, powerless.</p>
    <p>He had done all he could, and it was of no avail.</p>
    <p>Then people who had loved her, hearing, came up the green lanes from the city — the cobbler and
     the tinman, and the old woman who sold saints' pictures by the Broodhuis. The Varnhart children
     hung about the garden wicket, frightened and sobbing. Old Jehan beat his knees with his hands,
     and said only over and over again, "Another dead — another dead! — the red mill and I see them all
     dead!"</p>
    <p>The long golden day drifted away, and the swans swayed to and fro, and the willows grew
     silver in the sunshine.</p>
    <p>Bébée, only, lay quite still and never spoke. The starling sat above her head; his wings
     drooped, and he was silent too.</p>
    <p>Towards sunset Bébée raised herself and called aloud: they ran to her.</p>
    <p>"Get me a rosebud — one with the moss round it," she said to them.</p>
    <p>They went out into the garden, and brought her one wet with dew.</p>
    <p>She kissed it, and laid it in one of her little wooden shoes that stood upon the bed.</p>
    <p>"Send them to him," she said wearily; "tell him I walked all the way."</p>
    <p>Then her head drooped; then momentary consciousness died out: the old dull lifeless look
     crept over her face again like the shadow of death.</p>
    <p>The starling spread his broad black wings above her head. She lay quite still once more. The
     women left the rosebud in the wooden shoe, not knowing what she meant.</p>
    <p>Night fell. Mère Krebs watched beside her. Jeannot went down to the old church to beseech
     heaven with all his simple, ignorant, tortured soul. The villagers hovered about, talking in
     low sad voices, and wondering, and dropping one by one into their homes. They were sorry, very
     sorry; but what could they do?</p>
    <p>It was quite night. The lights were put out in the lane. Jeannot, with Father Francis, prayed
     before the shrine of the Seven Sorrows. Mère Krebs slumbered in her rush-bottomed chair; she
     was old and worked hard. The starling was awake.</p>
    <p>Bébée rose in her bed, and looked around, as she had done when she had asked for the
     moss-rosebud.</p>
    <p>A sense of unutterable universal pain ached over all her body.</p>
    <p>She did not see her little home, its four white walls, its lattice shining in the moon, its
     wooden bowls and plates, its oaken shelf and presses, its plain familiar things that once had
     been so dear, — she did not see them; she only saw the brown woman with her arm about his
     throat.</p>
    <p>She sat up in her bed and slipped her feet on to the floor; the pretty little rosy feet that
     he had used to want to clothe in silken stockings.</p>
    <p>Poor little feet! she felt a curious compassion for them; they had served her so well, and
     they were so tired.</p>
    <p>She sat up a moment with that curious dull agony, aching everywhere in body and in brain. She
     kissed the rosebud once more and laid it gently down in the wooden shoe. She did not see
     anything that was around her. She felt a great dulness that closed in on her, a great weight
     that was like iron on her head.</p>
    <p>She thought she was in the strange, noisy, cruel city, with' the river close to her, and all
     her dead dreams drifting down it like murdered children, whilst that woman kissed him.</p>
    <p>She slipped her feet on to the floor, and rose and stood upright. There was a door open to
     the moonlight — the door where she had sat spinning and singing in a thousand happy days; the
     lavender blew; the tall, unbudded green lilies swayed in the wind; she looked at them, and knew
     none of them.</p>
    <p>The night air drifted through her linen dress, and played on her bare arms, and lifted the
     curls of her hair; the same air that had played with her so many times out of mind when she had
     been a little tottering thing that measured its height by the red rosebush. But it brought her
     no sense of where she was.</p>
    <p>All she saw was the woman who kissed him.</p>
    <p>There was the water beyond; the kindly calm water, all green with the moss and the nests of
     the ouzels and the boughs of the hazels and willows, where the swans were asleep in the reeds,
     and the broad lilies spread wide and cool.</p>
    <p>But she did not see any memory in it. She thought it was the cruel gray river in the strange
     white city: and she cried to it; and went out into the old familiar ways, and knew none of
     them; and ran feebly yet fleetly through the bushes and flowers, looking up once at the stars
     with a helpless broken blind look, like a thing that is dying.</p>
    <p>"He does not want me!" she said to them; "he does not want me! — other women kiss him
     there!"</p>
    <p>Then with a low fluttering sound like a bird's when its wings are shot, and yet it tries to
     rise, she hovered a moment over the water, and stretched her arms out to it.</p>
    <p>"He does not want me!" she murmured; "he does not want me — and I am so tired. Dear God!"</p>
    <p>Then she crept down, as a weary child creeps to its mother, and threw herself forward, and
     let the green dark waters take her where they had found her amidst the lilies, a little
     laughing yearling thing.</p>
    <p>There she soon lay, quite quiet, with her face turned to the stars, and the starling poised
     above to watch her as she slept.</p>
    <p>She had been only Bébée: the ways of God and man had been too hard for her.</p>
    <p>When the messengers of Flamen came that day, they took him back a dead moss-rose and a pair
     of little wooden shoes worn through with walking.</p>
    <p>"One creature loved me once," he says to women who wonder why the wooden shoes are there.</p>
