    <head>BOOK THE FIRST <hi>SOWING</hi></head>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER I THE ONE THING NEEDFUL</head>
     <p>‘<hi>Now</hi>, what I want is, Facts.  Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts.  Facts
      alone are wanted in life.  Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.  You can only
      form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to
      them.  This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on
      which I bring up these children.  Stick to Facts, sir!’</p>
     <p>The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the speaker’s square
      forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on the
      schoolmaster’s sleeve.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker’s square wall of a forehead,
      which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark
      caves, overshadowed by the wall.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker’s mouth, which was
      wide, thin, and hard set.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker’s voice, which was
      inflexible, dry, and dictatorial.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker’s hair, which
      bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its
      shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had
      scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside.  The speaker’s obstinate carriage,
      square coat, square legs, square shoulders, — nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by
      the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it was, — all helped the
      emphasis.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 4"/>‘In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!’</p>
     <p>The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present, all backed a little,
      and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of little vessels then and there arranged in
      order, ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the
      brim.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER II MURDERING THE INNOCENTS</head>
     <p>Thomas Gradgrind, sir.  A man of realities.  A man of facts and calculations.  A
      man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and nothing over, and who is
      not to be talked into allowing for anything over.  Thomas Gradgrind, sir — peremptorily Thomas
      — Thomas Gradgrind.  With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in
      his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly
      what it comes to.  It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.  You might
      hope to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus
      Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all supposititious, non-existent persons),
      but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind — no, sir!</p>
     <p>In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether to his private
      circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  In such terms, no doubt, substituting
      the words ‘boys and girls,’ for ‘sir,’ Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the
      little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.</p>
     <p>Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned, he seemed a kind
      of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions
      of childhood at one discharge.  He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim
      mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away.</p>
     <p>‘Girl number twenty,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his square forefinger, ‘I
      don’t know that girl.  Who is that girl?’</p>
     <p>‘Sissy Jupe, sir,’ explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and curtseying.</p>
     <p>‘Sissy is not a name,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Don’t call yourself Sissy.  Call yourself
      Cecilia.’</p>
     <p>‘It’s father as calls me Sissy, sir,’ returned the young girl in a trembling voice, and with
      another curtsey.</p>
     <p>‘Then he has no business to do it,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Tell him he mustn’t.  Cecilia
      Jupe.  Let me see.  What is your father?’</p>
     <p>‘He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his hand.</p>
     <p>‘We don’t want to know anything about that, here.  You mustn’t tell us about that, here. 
      Your father breaks horses, don’t he?’</p>
     <p>‘If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses in the ring,
      sir.’</p>
     <p>‘You mustn’t tell us about the ring, here.  Very well, then.  Describe your father as a
      horsebreaker.  He doctors sick horses, I dare say?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh yes, sir.’</p>
     <p>‘Very well, then.  He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and horsebreaker.  Give me your
      definition of a horse.’</p>
     <p>(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)</p>
     <p>‘Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, for the general behoof of
      all the little pitchers.  ‘Girl number twenty possessed of no facts, in reference to one of
      the commonest of animals!  Some boy’s definition of a horse.  Bitzer, yours.’</p>
     <p>The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer, perhaps because he
      chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare windows of the
      intensely white-washed room, irradiated Sissy.  For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the
      inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow interval; and Sissy,
      being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of
      which Bitzer, being at the corner of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught
      the end.  But, whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to receive a
      deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone upon her, the boy was so
      light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same rays appeared to draw out of him what little
      colour he ever possessed.  His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends
      of lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something paler than
      themselves, expressed their form.  His short-cropped hair might have been a mere continuation
      of the sandy freckles on his forehead and face.  His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in
      the natural tinge, that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.</p>
     <p>‘Bitzer,’ said Thomas Gradgrind.  ‘Your definition of a horse.’</p>
     <p>‘Quadruped.  Graminivorous.  Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and
      twelve incisive.  Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds hoofs, too.  Hoofs
      hard, but requiring to be shod with iron.  Age known by marks in mouth.’  Thus (and much more)
      Bitzer.</p>
     <p>‘Now girl number twenty,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘You know what a horse is.’</p>
     <p>She curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have blushed deeper than
      she had blushed all this time.  Bitzer, after rapidly blinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both
      eyes at once, and so catching the light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked
      like the antennæ of busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down
      again.</p>
     <p>The third gentleman now stepped forth.  A mighty man at cutting and drying, he was; a
      government officer; in his way (and in most other people’s too), a professed pugilist; always
      in training, always with a system to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be
      heard of at the bar of his little Public-office, ready to fight all England.  To continue in
      fistic phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to the scratch, wherever and whatever it
      was, and proving himself an ugly customer.  He would go in and damage any subject whatever
      with his right, follow up with his left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his opponent (he always
      fought All England) to the ropes, and fall upon him neatly.  He was certain to knock the wind
      out of common sense, and render that unlucky adversary deaf to the call of time.  And he had
      it in charge from high authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when
      Commissioners should reign upon earth.</p>
     <p>‘Very well,’ said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms.  ‘That’s a horse. 
      Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a room with representations of
      horses?’</p>
     <p>After a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, ‘Yes, sir!’  Upon which the other
      half, seeing in the gentleman’s face that Yes was wrong, cried out in chorus, ‘No, sir!’ — as
      the custom is, in these examinations.</p>
     <p>‘Of course, No.  Why wouldn’t you?’</p>
     <p>A pause.  One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing, ventured the answer,
      Because he wouldn’t paper a room at all, but would paint it.</p>
     <p>‘You <hi>must</hi> paper it,’ said the gentleman, rather warmly.</p>
     <p>‘You must paper it,’ said Thomas Gradgrind, ‘whether you like it or not.  Don’t tell
       <hi>us</hi> you wouldn’t paper it.  What do you mean, boy?’</p>
     <p>‘I’ll explain to you, then,’ said the gentleman, after another and a dismal pause, ‘why you
      wouldn’t paper a room with representations of horses.  Do you ever see horses walking up and
      down the sides of rooms in reality — in fact?  Do you?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir!’ from one half.  ‘No, sir!’ from the other.</p>
     <p>‘Of course no,’ said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong half.  ‘Why, then,
      you are not to see anywhere, what you don’t see in fact; you are not to have anywhere, what
      you don’t have in fact.  What is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.’  Thomas
      Gradgrind nodded his approbation.</p>
     <p>‘This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,’ said the gentleman.  ‘Now, I’ll
      try you again.  Suppose you were going to carpet a room.  Would you use a carpet having a
      representation of flowers upon it?’</p>
     <p>There being a general conviction by this time that ‘No, sir!’ was always the right answer to
      this gentleman, the chorus of <hi>No</hi> was very strong.  Only a few feeble stragglers said
      Yes: among them Sissy Jupe.</p>
     <p>‘Girl number twenty,’ said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of knowledge.</p>
     <p>Sissy blushed, and stood up.</p>
     <p>‘So you would carpet your room — or your husband’s room, if you were a grown woman, and had
      a husband — with representations of flowers, would you?’ said the gentleman.  ‘Why would
      you?’</p>
     <p>‘If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,’ returned the girl.</p>
     <p>‘And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have people walking over
      them with heavy boots?’</p>
     <p>‘It wouldn’t hurt them, sir.  They wouldn’t crush and wither, if you please, sir.  They
      would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I would fancy — ’</p>
     <p>‘Ay, ay, ay!  But you mustn’t fancy,’ cried the gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily
      to his point.  ‘That’s it!  You are never to fancy.’</p>
     <p>‘You are not, Cecilia Jupe,’ Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, ‘to do anything of that
      kind.’</p>
     <p>‘Fact, fact, fact!’ said the gentleman.  And ‘Fact, fact, fact!’ repeated Thomas
      Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘You are to be in all things regulated and governed,’ said the gentleman, ‘by fact.  We hope
      to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the
      people to be a people of fact, and of nothing but fact.  You must discard the word Fancy
      altogether.  You have nothing to do with it.  You are not to have, in any object of use or
      ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact.  You don’t walk upon flowers in fact; you
      cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets.  You don’t find that foreign birds and
      butterflies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds
      and butterflies upon your crockery.  You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls;
      you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.  You must use,’ said the gentleman, ‘for
      all these purposes, combinations and modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical
      figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration.  This is the new discovery.  This is
      fact.  This is taste.’</p>
     <p>The girl curtseyed, and sat down.  She was very young, and she
      <pb n=" 8"/>looked as if she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world
      afforded.</p>
     <p>‘Now, if Mr. M’Choakumchild,’ said the gentleman, ‘will proceed to give his first lesson
      here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his mode of procedure.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged.  ‘Mr. M’Choakumchild, we only wait for you.’</p>
     <p>So, Mr. M’Choakumchild began in his best manner.  He and some one hundred and forty other
      schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time, in the same factory, on the same
      principles, like so many pianoforte legs.  He had been put through an immense variety of
      paces, and had answered volumes of head-breaking questions.  Orthography, etymology, syntax,
      and prosody, biography, astronomy, geography, and general cosmography, the sciences of
      compound proportion, algebra, land-surveying and levelling, vocal music, and drawing from
      models, were all at the ends of his ten chilled fingers.  He had worked his stony way into Her
      Majesty’s most Honourable Privy Council’s Schedule B, and had taken the bloom off the higher
      branches of mathematics and physical science, French, German, Latin, and Greek.  He knew all
      about all the Water Sheds of all the world (whatever they are), and all the histories of all
      the peoples, and all the names of all the rivers and mountains, and all the productions,
      manners, and customs of all the countries, and all their boundaries and bearings on the two
      and thirty points of the compass.  Ah, rather overdone, M’Choakumchild.  If he had only learnt
      a little less, how infinitely better he might have taught much more!</p>
     <p>He went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike Morgiana in the Forty Thieves:
      looking into all the vessels ranged before him, one after another, to see what they
      contained.  Say, good M’Choakumchild.  When from thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar
      brim full by-and-by, dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy
      lurking within — or sometimes only maim him and distort him!</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER III A LOOPHOLE</head>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind walked homeward from the school, in a state of considerable
      satisfaction.  It was his school, and he intended it to be a model.  He intended every child
      in it to be a model — just as the young Gradgrinds were all models.</p>
     <p>There were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every one.  They had been lectured
      at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little hares.  Almost as soon as they could run
      alone, they had been made to run to the lecture-room.  The first object with which they had an
      association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre
      chalking ghastly white figures on it.</p>
     <p>Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact forbid!  I only use the
      word to express a monster in a lecturing castle, with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated
      into one, taking childhood captive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the
      hair.</p>
     <p>No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the moon before it could
      speak distinctly.  No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle,
      little star; how I wonder what you are!  No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the
      subject, each little Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a
      Professor Owen, and driven Charles’s Wain like a locomotive engine-driver.  No little
      Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who
      tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt, or with that yet more
      famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb: it had never heard of those celebrities, and had only been
      introduced to a cow as a graminivorous ruminating quadruped with several stomachs.</p>
     <p>To his matter-of-fact home, which was called Stone Lodge, Mr. Gradgrind directed his steps. 
      He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he built Stone Lodge, and
      was now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in
      Parliament.  Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great town — called
      Coketown in the present faithful guide-book.</p>
     <p>A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was.  Not the least disguise
      toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape.  A great square house,
      with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows, as its master’s heavy brows overshadowed
      his eyes.  A calculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house.  Six windows on this side of the
      door, six on that side; a total of twelve in this wing, a total of twelve in the other wing;
      four-and-twenty carried over to the back wings.  A lawn and garden and an infant avenue, all
      ruled straight like a botanical account-book.  Gas and ventilation, drainage and
      water-service, all of the primest quality.  Iron clamps and girders, fire-proof from top to
      bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with all their brushes and brooms; everything
      that heart could desire.</p>
     <p>Everything?  Well, I suppose so.  The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments
      of science too.  They had a little conchological cabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet,
      and a little mineralogical cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the
      bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances
      by those tremendously hard instruments their own names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of
      Peter Piper, who had never found his way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds
      grasped at more than this, what was it for good gracious goodness’ sake, that the greedy
      little Gradgrinds grasped it!</p>
     <p>Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind.  He was an affectionate
      father, after his manner; but he would probably have described himself (if he had been put,
      like Sissy Jupe, upon a definition) as ‘an eminently practical’ father.  He had a particular
      pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to
      him.  Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such
      meeting, some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical
      friend Gradgrind.  This always pleased the eminently practical friend.  He knew it to be his
      due, but his due was acceptable.</p>
     <p>He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which was neither town nor
      country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the sound of music.  The
      clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up
      its rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray.  A flag, floating from the summit of the
      temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was ‘Sleary’s Horse-riding’ which claimed their
      suffrages.  Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an
      ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money.  Miss Josephine Sleary, as
      some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the
      entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act.  Among the other pleasing but
      always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that
      afternoon to ‘elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog
      Merrylegs.’  He was also to exhibit ‘his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five
      hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid
      iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having
      elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.’  The same
      Signor Jupe was to ‘enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste
      Shaksperean quips and retorts.’  Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite
      character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in ‘the highly novel and laughable
      hippo-comedietta of The Tailor’s Journey to Brentford.’</p>
     <p>Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical
      man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them
      to the House of Correction.  But, the turning of the road took him by the back of the booth,
      and at the back of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of stealthy
      attitudes, striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the place.</p>
     <p>This brought him to a stop.  ‘Now, to think of these vagabonds,’ said he, ‘attracting the
      young rabble from a model school.’</p>
     <p>A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young rabble, he took his
      eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child he knew by name, and might order off. 
      Phenomenon almost incredible though distinctly seen, what did he then behold but his own
      metallurgical Louisa, peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board, and his own
      mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a hoof of the graceful
      equestrian Tyrolean flower-act!</p>
     <p>Dumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family was thus disgraced,
      laid his hand upon each erring child, and said:</p>
     <p>‘Louisa!!  Thomas!!’</p>
     <p>Both rose, red and disconcerted.  But, Louisa looked at her father with more boldness than
      Thomas did.  Indeed, Thomas did not look at him, but gave himself up to be taken home like a
      machine.</p>
     <p>‘In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, leading each away by a
      hand; ‘what do you do here?’</p>
     <p>‘Wanted to see what it was like,’ returned Louisa, shortly.</p>
     <p>‘What it was like?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, father.’</p>
     <p>There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and particularly in the girl: yet,
      struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face, there was a light with nothing to rest
      upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which
      brightened its expression.  Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with
      uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them, analogous to the
      changes on a blind face groping its way.</p>
     <p>She was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would seem to become a
      woman all at once.  Her father thought so as he looked at her.  She was pretty.  Would have
      been self-willed (he thought in his eminently practical way) but for her bringing-up.</p>
     <p>‘Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe that you, with
      your education and resources, should have brought your sister to a scene like this.’</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 12"/>‘I brought <hi>him</hi>, father,’ said Louisa, quickly.  ‘I asked him to
      come.’</p>
     <p>‘I am sorry to hear it.  I am very sorry indeed to hear it.  It makes Thomas no better, and
      it makes you worse, Louisa.’</p>
     <p>She looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek.</p>
     <p>‘You!  Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas and you, who may
      be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who have been trained to mathematical
      exactness; Thomas and you, here!’ cried Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘In this degraded position!  I am
      amazed.’</p>
     <p>‘I was tired, father.  I have been tired a long time,’ said Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Tired?  Of what?’ asked the astonished father.</p>
     <p>‘I don’t know of what — of everything, I think.’</p>
     <p>‘Say not another word,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘You are childish.  I will hear no more.’ 
      He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely
      broke out with: ‘What would your best friends say, Louisa?  Do you attach no value to their
      good opinion?  What would Mr. Bounderby say?’  At the mention of this name, his daughter stole
      a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character.  He saw nothing of it, for
      before he looked at her, she had again cast down her eyes!</p>
     <p>‘What,’ he repeated presently, ‘would Mr. Bounderby say?’  All the way to Stone Lodge, as
      with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home, he repeated at intervals ‘What would
      Mr. Bounderby say?’ — as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER IV MR. BOUNDERBY</head>
     <p>Not being Mrs. Grundy, who <hi>was</hi> Mr. Bounderby?</p>
     <p>Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind’s bosom friend, as a man perfectly devoid
      of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of
      sentiment.  So near was Mr. Bounderby — or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.</p>
     <p>He was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not.  A big, loud man, with a
      stare, and a metallic laugh.  A man made out of a coarse material, which seemed to have been
      stretched to make so much of him.  A man with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins
      in his temples, and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open, and
      lift his eyebrows up.  A man with a pervading appearance on him of being inflated like a
      balloon, and ready to start.  A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made
      man.  A man who was always proclaiming, through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of
      his, his old ignorance and his old poverty.  A man who was the Bully of humility.</p>
     <p>A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby looked older; his
      seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again, without
      surprising anybody.  He had not much hair.  One might have fancied he had talked it off; and
      that what was left, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being constantly
      blown about by his windy boastfulness.</p>
     <p>In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the hearthrug, warming himself before
      the fire, Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of
      its being his birthday.  He stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring
      afternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by
      the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus took up a commanding position, from which to
      subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘I hadn’t a shoe to my foot.  As to a stocking, I didn’t know such a thing by name.  I
      passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.  That’s the way I spent my tenth
      birthday.  Not that a ditch was new to me, for I was born in a ditch.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of surpassing feebleness,
      mental and bodily; who was always taking physic without any effect, and who, whenever she
      showed a symptom of coming to life, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact
      tumbling on her; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch?</p>
     <p>‘No!  As wet as a sop.  A foot of water in it,’ said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Enough to give a baby cold,’ Mrs. Gradgrind considered.</p>
     <p>‘Cold?  I was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything else, I believe, that
      was capable of inflammation,’ returned Mr. Bounderby.  ‘For years, ma’am, I was one of the
      most miserable little wretches ever seen.  I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and
      groaning.  I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldn’t have touched me with a pair of
      tongs.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing her imbecility
      could think of doing.</p>
     <p>‘How I fought through it, <hi>I</hi> don’t know,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I was determined, I
      suppose.  I have been a determined character in later life, and I suppose I was then.  Here I
      am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody to thank for my being here, but myself.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother — </p>
     <p>‘<hi>My</hi> mother?  Bolted, ma’am!’ said Bounderby.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up.</p>
     <p>‘My mother left me to my grandmother,’ said Bounderby; ‘and, according to the best of my
      remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived.  If I
      got a little pair of shoes by any chance, she would take ’em off and sell ’em for drink.  Why,
      I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses of liquor
      before breakfast!’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality, looked (as she always
      did) like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure, without enough
      light behind it.</p>
     <p>‘She kept a chandler’s shop,’ pursued Bounderby, ‘and kept me in an egg-box.  That was the
      cot of <hi>my</hi> infancy; an old egg-box.  As soon as I was big enough to run away, of
      course I ran away.  Then I became a young vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me
      about and starving me, everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me.  They were
      right; they had no business to do anything else.  I was a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a
      pest.  I know that very well.’</p>
     <p>His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to
      be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to be satisfied by three sonorous
      repetitions of the boast.</p>
     <p>‘I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.  Whether I was to do it or not, ma’am,
      I did it.  I pulled through it, though nobody threw me out a rope.  Vagabond, errand-boy,
      vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk, chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of
      Coketown.  Those are the antecedents, and the culmination.  Josiah Bounderby of Coketown
      learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and was first able to tell
      the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the steeple clock of St. Giles’s Church, London,
      under the direction of a drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible
      vagrant.  Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your model schools,
      and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish of schools; and Josiah Bounderby of
      Coketown, tells you plainly, all right, all correct — he hadn’t such advantages — but let us
      have hard-headed, solid-fisted people — the education that made him won’t do for everybody, he
      knows well — such and such his education was, however, and you may force him to swallow
      boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life.’</p>
     <p>Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped.  He
      stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still accompanied by the two young culprits,
      entered the room.  His eminently practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave
      Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said, ‘Behold your Bounderby!’</p>
     <p>‘Well!’ blustered Mr. Bounderby, ‘what’s the matter?  What is young Thomas in the dumps
      about?’</p>
     <p>He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘We were peeping at the circus,’ muttered Louisa, haughtily, without lifting up her eyes,
      ‘and father caught us.’</p>
     <p>‘And, Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband in a lofty manner, ‘I should as soon have expected
      to find my children reading poetry.’</p>
     <p>‘Dear me,’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘How can you, Louisa and Thomas!  I wonder at you.  I
      declare you’re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all.  I have a great mind
      to say I wish I hadn’t.  <hi>Then</hi> what would you have done, I should like to know?’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.  He frowned
      impatiently.</p>
     <p>‘As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn’t go and look at the shells
      and minerals and things provided for you, instead of circuses!’ said Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘You
      know, as well as I do, no young people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or
      attend lectures about circuses.  What can you possibly want to know of circuses then?  I am
      sure you have enough to do, if that’s what you want.  With my head in its present state, I
      couldn’t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.’</p>
     <p>‘That’s the reason!’ pouted Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Don’t tell me that’s the reason, because it can’t be nothing of the sort,’ said Mrs.
      Gradgrind.  ‘Go and be somethingological directly.’  Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific
      character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to
      choose their pursuit.</p>
     <p>In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind’s stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr.
      Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two
      reasons.  Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had
      ‘no nonsense’ about her.  By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free
      from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute
      idiot, ever was.</p>
     <p>The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was
      sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other
      fact.  So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her.</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, ‘you are always so
      interested in my young people — particularly in Louisa — that I make no apology for saying to
      you, I am very much vexed by this discovery.  I have systematically devoted myself (as you
      know) to the education of the reason of my family.  The reason is (as you know) the only
      faculty to which education should be addressed.  ‘And yet, Bounderby, it would appear from
      this unexpected circumstance of to-day, though in itself a trifling one, as if something had
      crept into Thomas’s and Louisa’s minds which is — or rather, which is not — I don’t know that
      I can express myself better than by saying — which has never been intended to be developed,
      and in which their reason has no part.’</p>
     <p>‘There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds,’ returned
      Bounderby.  ‘When I was a vagabond myself, nobody looked with any interest at <hi>me</hi>; I
      know that.’</p>
     <p>‘Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his eyes on the fire,
      ‘in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?’</p>
     <p>‘I’ll tell you in what.  In idle imagination.’</p>
     <p>‘I hope not,’ said the eminently practical; ‘I confess, however, that the misgiving
       <hi>has</hi> crossed me on my way home.’</p>
     <p>‘In idle imagination, Gradgrind,’ repeated Bounderby.  ‘A very bad thing for anybody, but a
      cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.  I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind’s pardon for strong
      expressions, but that she knows very well I am not a refined character.  Whoever expects
      refinement in <hi>me</hi> will be disappointed.  I hadn’t a refined bringing up.’</p>
     <p>‘Whether,’ said Gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and his cavernous eyes
      on the fire, ‘whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything?  Whether Louisa
      or Thomas can have been reading anything?  Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle
      story-book can have got into the house?  Because, in minds that have been practically formed
      by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.’</p>
     <p>‘Stop a bit!’ cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the
      hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility.  ‘You have one of
      those strollers’ children in the school.’</p>
     <p>‘Cecilia Jupe, by name,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his
      friend.</p>
     <p>‘Now, stop a bit!’ cried Bounderby again.  ‘How did she come there?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now.  She specially
      applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and — yes,
      you are right, Bounderby, you are right.’</p>
     <p>‘Now, stop a bit!’ cried Bounderby, once more.  ‘Louisa saw her when she came?’</p>
     <p>‘Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.  But Louisa saw her,
      I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind’s presence.’</p>
     <p>‘Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, ‘what passed?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh, my poor health!’ returned Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘The girl wanted to come to the school, and
      Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the
      girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to
      contradict them when such was the fact!’</p>
     <p>‘Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Turn this girl to the right about,
      and there’s an end of it.’</p>
     <p>‘I am much of your opinion.’</p>
     <p>‘Do it at once,’ said Bounderby, ‘has always been my motto from a child.  When I thought I
      would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did it at once.  Do you the same.  Do
      this at once!’</p>
     <p>‘Are you walking?’ asked his friend.  ‘I have the father’s address.  Perhaps you would not
      mind walking to town with me?’</p>
     <p>‘Not the least in the world,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘as long as you do it at once!’</p>
     <p>So, Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat — he always threw it on, as expressing a man who had been
      far too busily employed in making himself, to acquire any fashion of wearing his hat — and
      with his hands in his pockets, sauntered out into the hall.  ‘I never wear gloves,’ it was his
      custom to say.  ‘I didn’t climb up the ladder in <hi>them</hi>. — Shouldn’t be so high up, if
      I had.’</p>
     <p>Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind went up-stairs for the
      address, he opened the door of the children’s study and looked into that serene floor-clothed
      apartment, which, notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned
      and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to
      hair-cutting.  Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out, without looking at
      anything, while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire.  Adam Smith and Malthus,
      two younger Gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after manufacturing a
      good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over
      vulgar fractions.</p>
     <p>‘It’s all right now, Louisa: it’s all right, young Thomas,’ said Mr. Bounderby; ‘you won’t
      do so any more.  I’ll answer for it’s being all over with father.  Well, Louisa, that’s worth
      a kiss, isn’t it?’</p>
     <p>‘You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,’ returned Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly
      walked across the room, and
      <pb n=" 18"/>ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face turned away.</p>
     <p>‘Always my pet; ain’t you, Louisa?’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Good-bye, Louisa!’</p>
     <p>He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her
      handkerchief, until it was burning red.  She was still doing this, five minutes
      afterwards.</p>
     <p>‘What are you about, Loo?’ her brother sulkily remonstrated.  ‘You’ll rub a hole in your
      face.’</p>
     <p>‘You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom.  I wouldn’t cry!’</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER V THE KEYNOTE</head>
     <p>Coketown, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of
      fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself.  Let us strike the
      key-note, Coketown, before pursuing our tune.</p>
     <p>It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had
      allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted
      face of a savage.  It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable
      serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.  It had a
      black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of
      building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where
      the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant
      in a state of melancholy madness.  It contained several large streets all very like one
      another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like
      one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same
      pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to-morrow,
      and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.</p>
     <p>These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work by which it was
      sustained; against them were to be set off, comforts of life which found their way all over
      the world, and elegancies of life which made, we will not ask how much of the fine lady, who
      could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned.  The rest of its features were voluntary, and
      they were these.</p>
     <p>You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful.  If the members of a religious
      persuasion built a chapel there — as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done —
      they made it a pious warehouse of red brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly
      ornamental examples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.  The solitary exception was the
      New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, terminating in four short
      pinnacles like florid wooden legs.  All the public inscriptions in the town were painted
      alike, in severe characters of black and white.  The jail might have been the infirmary, the
      infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything
      else, for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction.  Fact,
      fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the
      immaterial.  The M’Choakumchild school was all fact, and the school of design was all fact,
      and the relations between master and man were all fact, and everything was fact between the
      lying-in hospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn’t state in figures, or show to be
      purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest, was not, and never should be,
      world without end, Amen.</p>
     <p>A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course got on well?  Why
      no, not quite well.  No?  Dear me!</p>
     <p>No.  Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like gold that had stood
      the fire.  First, the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the eighteen
      denominations?  Because, whoever did, the labouring people did not.  It was very strange to
      walk through the streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of <hi>them</hi> the barbarous
      jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from their own
      quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged
      listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no
      manner of concern.  Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there was a
      native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be heard of in the House of
      Commons every session, indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these
      people religious by main force.  Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that these
      same people <hi>would</hi> get drunk, and showed in tabular statements that they did get
      drunk, and proved at tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine (except a medal), would
      induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk.  Then came the chemist and druggist, with
      other tabular statements, showing that when they didn’t get drunk, they took opium.  Then came
      the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular statements, outdoing all the previous
      tabular statements, and showing that the same people <hi>would</hi> resort to low haunts,
      hidden from the public eye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap
      joined in it; and where A. B., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for eighteen
      months’ solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of
      belief) his ruin began, as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have
      been a tip-top moral specimen.  Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two gentlemen
      at this present moment walking through Coketown, and both eminently practical, who could, on
      occasion, furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience, and
      illustrated by cases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appeared — in short, it
      was the only clear thing in the case — that these same people were a bad lot altogether,
      gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it, gentlemen; that
      they were restless, gentlemen; that they never knew what they wanted; that they lived upon the
      best, and bought fresh butter; and insisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but prime parts
      of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable.  In short, it was the moral of
      the old nursery fable:</p>
     <quote>
      <p>There was an old woman, and what do you think? She lived upon nothing but victuals and
       drink; Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet, And yet this old woman would
        <hi>NEVER</hi> be quiet.</p></quote>
     <p>Is it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of the Coketown
      population and the case of the little Gradgrinds?  Surely, none of us in our sober senses and
      acquainted with figures, are to be told at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements
      in the existence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years, deliberately set
      at nought?  That there was any Fancy in them demanding to be brought into healthy existence
      instead of struggling on in convulsions?  That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and
      monotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical relief — some relaxation,
      encouraging good humour and good spirits, and giving them a vent — some recognized holiday,
      though it were but for an honest dance to a stirring band of music — some occasional light pie
      in which even M’Choakumchild had no finger — which craving must and would be satisfied aright,
      or must and would inevitably go wrong, until the laws of the Creation were repealed?</p>
     <p>‘This man lives at Pod’s End, and I don’t quite know Pod’s End,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Which
      is it, Bounderby?’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more respecting it.  So they
      stopped for a moment, looking about.</p>
     <p>Almost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and
      with a frightened look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind recognized.  ‘Halloa!’ said he.  ‘Stop! 
      Where are you going! Stop!’  Girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a
      curtsey.</p>
     <p>‘Why are you tearing about the streets,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘in this improper manner?’</p>
     <p>‘I was — I was run after, sir,’ the girl panted, ‘and I wanted to get away.’</p>
     <p>‘Run after?’ repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Who would run after <hi>you</hi>?’</p>
     <p>The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the colourless boy, Bitzer,
      who came round the corner with such blind speed and so little anticipating a stoppage on the
      pavement, that he brought himself up against Mr. Gradgrind’s waistcoat and rebounded into the
      road.</p>
     <p>‘What do you mean, boy?’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘What are you doing?  How dare you dash
      against — everybody — in this manner?’  Bitzer picked up his cap, which the concussion had
      knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his forehead, pleaded that it was an accident.</p>
     <p>‘Was this boy running after you, Jupe?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir,’ said the girl reluctantly.</p>
     <p>‘No, I wasn’t, sir!’ cried Bitzer.  ‘Not till she run away from me.  But the horse-riders
      never mind what they say, sir; they’re famous for it.  You know the horse-riders are famous
      for never minding what they say,’ addressing Sissy.  ‘It’s as well known in the town as —
      please, sir, as the multiplication table isn’t known to the horse-riders.’  Bitzer tried Mr.
      Bounderby with this.</p>
     <p>‘He frightened me so,’ said the girl, ‘with his cruel faces!’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!’ cried Bitzer.  ‘Oh!  An’t you one of the rest!  An’t you a horse-rider!  I never
      looked at her, sir.  I asked her if she would know how to define a horse to-morrow, and
      offered to tell her again, and she ran away, and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how
      to answer when she was asked.  You wouldn’t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn’t
      been a horse-rider?’</p>
     <p>‘Her calling seems to be pretty well known among ’em,’ observed Mr. Bounderby.  ‘You’d have
      had the whole school peeping in a row, in a week.’</p>
     <p>‘Truly, I think so,’ returned his friend.  ‘Bitzer, turn you about and take yourself home.
      Jupe, stay here a moment.  Let me hear of your running in this manner any more, boy, and you
      will hear of me through the master of the school.  You understand what I mean.  Go along.’</p>
     <p>The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again, glanced at Sissy, turned
      about, and retreated.</p>
     <p>‘Now, girl,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘take this gentleman and me to your father’s; we are going
      there.  What have you got in that bottle you are carrying?’</p>
     <p>‘Gin,’ said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Dear, no, sir!  It’s the nine oils.’</p>
     <p>‘The what?’ cried Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘The nine oils, sir, to rub father with.’</p>
     <p>‘Then,’ said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short laugh, ‘what the devil do you rub your father
      with nine oils for?’</p>
     <p>‘It’s what our people aways use, sir, when they get any hurts in the ring,’ replied the
      girl, looking over her shoulder, to assure herself that her pursuer was gone.  ‘They bruise
      themselves very bad sometimes.’</p>
     <p>‘Serve ’em right,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘for being idle.’  She glanced up at his face, with
      mingled astonishment and dread.</p>
     <p>‘By George!’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘when I was four or five years younger than you, I had
      worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty oils, would have rubbed off.  I didn’t
      get ’em by posture-making, but by being banged about.  There was no rope-dancing for me; I
      danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr. Bounderby.  His
      character was not unkind, all things considered; it might have been a very kind one indeed, if
      he had only made some round mistake in the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.  He said,
      in what he meant for a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, ‘And this is Pod’s
      End; is it, Jupe?’</p>
     <p>‘This is it, sir, and — if you wouldn’t mind, sir — this is the house.’</p>
     <p>She stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little public-house, with dim red lights in
      it.  As haggard and as shabby, as if, for want of custom, it had itself taken to drinking, and
      had gone the way all drunkards go, and was very near the end of it.</p>
     <p>‘It’s only crossing the bar, sir, and up the stairs, if you wouldn’t mind, and waiting there
      for a moment till I get a candle.  If you should hear a dog, sir, it’s only Merrylegs, and he
      only barks.’</p>
     <p>‘Merrylegs and nine oils, eh!’ said Mr. Bounderby, entering last with his metallic laugh. 
      ‘Pretty well this, for a self-made man!’</p>

     <head>CHAPTER VI SLEARY’S HORSEMANSHIP</head>
     <p>The name of the public-house was the Pegasus’s Arms.  The Pegasus’s legs might have
      been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse upon the sign-board, the Pegasus’s
      Arms was inscribed in Roman letters.  Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the
      painter had touched off the lines:</p>
     <quote>
      <l>Good malt makes good beer, </l>
      <l>Walk in, and they’ll draw it here; </l>
      <l>Good wine makes good brandy, </l>
      <l>Give us a call, and you’ll find it handy.</l></quote>
     <p>Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another Pegasus — a
      theatrical one — with real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and
      his ethereal harness made of red silk.</p>
     <p>As it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not grown light enough
      within to see the picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these
      idealities.  They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and
      stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle.  They expected every moment to hear
      Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and
      the candle appeared together.</p>
     <p>‘Father is not in our room, sir,’ she said, with a face of great surprise.  ‘If you wouldn’t
      mind walking in, I’ll find him directly.’  They walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs
      for them, sped away with a quick light step.  It was a mean, shabbily furnished room, with a
      bed in it.  The white night-cap, embellished with two peacock’s feathers and a pigtail bolt
      upright, in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances with
      his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts, hung upon a nail; but no other portion of his
      wardrobe, or other token of himself or his pursuits, was to be seen anywhere.  As to
      Merrylegs, that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who went aboard the ark,
      might have been accidentally shut out of it, for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or
      ear in the Pegasus’s Arms.</p>
     <p>They heard the doors of rooms above, opening and shutting as Sissy went from one to another
      in quest of her father; and presently they heard voices expressing surprise.  She came
      bounding down again in a great hurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk, found it
      empty, and looked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror.</p>
     <p>‘Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir.  I don’t know why he should go there, but he
      must be there; I’ll bring him in a minute!’  She was gone directly, without her bonnet; with
      her long, dark, childish hair streaming behind her.</p>
     <p>‘What does she mean!’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Back in a minute?  It’s more than a mile
      off.’</p>
     <p>Before Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and introducing himself
      with the words, ‘By your leaves, gentlemen!’ walked in with his hands in his pockets.  His
      face, close-shaven, thin, and sallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed
      into a roll all round his head, and parted up the centre.  His legs were very robust, but
      shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.  His chest and back were as much too
      broad, as his legs were too short.  He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting
      trousers; wore a shawl round his neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses’
      provender, and sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of the stable
      and the play-house.  Where the one began, and the other ended, nobody could have told with any
      precision.  This gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers, so
      justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American
      Prairies; in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old face, who now accompanied
      him, assisted as his infant son: being carried upside down over his father’s shoulder, by one
      foot, and held by the crown of his head, heels upwards, in the palm of his father’s hand,
      according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle
      their offspring.  Made up with curls, wreaths, wings, white bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful
      young person soared into so pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the
      maternal part of the spectators; but in private, where his characteristics were a precocious
      cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice, he became of the Turf, turfy.</p>
     <p>‘By your leaves, gentlemen,’ said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, glancing round the room.  ‘It was
      you, I believe, that were wishing to see Jupe!’</p>
     <p>‘It was,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘His daughter has gone to fetch him, but I can’t wait;
      therefore, if you please, I will leave a message for him with you.’</p>
     <p>‘You see, my friend,’ Mr. Bounderby put in, ‘we are the kind of people who know the value of
      time, and you are the kind of people who don’t know the value of time.’</p>
     <p>‘I have not,’ retorted Mr. Childers, after surveying him from head to foot, ‘the honour of
      knowing <hi>you</hi>, — but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than I can
      of mine, I should judge from your appearance, that you are about right.’</p>
     <p>‘And when you have made it, you can keep it too, I should think,’ said Cupid.</p>
     <p>‘Kidderminster, stow that!’ said Mr. Childers.  (Master Kidderminster was Cupid’s mortal
      name.)</p>
     <p>‘What does he come here cheeking us for, then?’ cried Master Kidderminster, showing a very
      irascible temperament.  ‘If you want to cheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it
      out.’</p>
     <p>‘Kidderminster,’ said Mr. Childers, raising his voice, ‘stow that! — Sir,’ to Mr. Gradgrind,
      ‘I was addressing myself to you.  You may or you may not be aware (for perhaps you have not
      been much in the audience), that Jupe has missed his tip very often, lately.’</p>
     <p>‘Has — what has he missed?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent Bounderby for
      assistance.</p>
     <p>‘Missed his tip.’</p>
     <p>‘Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done ’em once,’ said Master
      Kidderminster.  ‘Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was loose in his ponging.’</p>
     <p>‘Didn’t do what he ought to do.  Was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling,’ Mr.
      Childers interpreted.</p>
     <p>‘Oh!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that is tip, is it?’</p>
     <p>‘In a general way that’s missing his tip,’ Mr. E. W. B. Childers answered.</p>
     <p>‘Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!’ ejaculated
      Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs.  ‘Queer sort of company, too, for a man who has raised
      himself!’</p>
     <p>‘Lower yourself, then,’ retorted Cupid.  ‘Oh Lord! if you’ve raised yourself so high as all
      that comes to, let yourself down a bit.’</p>
     <p>‘This is a very obtrusive lad!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting his brows on
      him.</p>
     <p>‘We’d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were coming,’ retorted
      Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed.  ‘It’s a pity you don’t have a bespeak, being so
      particular.  You’re on the Tight-Jeff, ain’t you?’</p>
     <p>‘What does this unmannerly boy mean,’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, eyeing him in a sort of
      desperation, ‘by Tight-Jeff?’</p>
     <p>‘There!  Get out, get out!’ said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend from the room,
      rather in the prairie manner.  ‘Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff, it don’t much signify: it’s only
      tight-rope and slack-rope.  You were going to give me a message for Jupe?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, I was.’</p>
     <p>‘Then,’ continued Mr. Childers, quickly, ‘my opinion is, he will never receive it.  Do you
      know much of him?’</p>
     <p>‘I never saw the man in my life.’</p>
     <p>‘I doubt if you ever <hi>will</hi> see him now.  It’s pretty plain to me, he’s off.’</p>
     <p>‘Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?’</p>
     <p>‘Ay!  I mean,’ said Mr. Childers, with a nod, ‘that he has cut.  He was goosed last night,
      he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed to-day.  He has lately got in the way of
      being always goosed, and he can’t stand it.’</p>
     <p>‘Why has he been — so very much — Goosed?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the word out of
      himself, with great solemnity and reluctance.</p>
     <p>‘His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up,’ said Childers.  ‘He has his
      points as a Cackler still, but he can’t get a living out of <hi>them</hi>.’</p>
     <p>‘A Cackler!’ Bounderby repeated.  ‘Here we go again!’</p>
     <p>‘A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,’ said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, superciliously
      throwing the interpretation over his shoulder, and accompanying it with a shake of his long
      hair — which all shook at once.  ‘Now, it’s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man
      deeper, to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with it.’</p>
     <p>‘Good!’ interrupted Mr. Bounderby.  ‘This is good, Gradgrind!  A man so fond of his
      daughter, that he runs away from her!  This is devilish good!  Ha! ha!  Now, I’ll tell you
      what, young man.  I haven’t always occupied my present station of life.  I know what these
      things are.  You may be astonished to hear it, but my mother — ran away from <hi>me</hi>.’</p>
     <p>E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to hear it.</p>
     <p>‘Very well,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me.  Do I
      excuse her for it?  No.  Have I ever excused her for it?  Not I.  What do I call her for it? 
      I call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken
      grandmother.  There’s no family pride about me, there’s no imaginative sentimental humbug
      about me.  I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown,
      without any fear or any favour, what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick
      Jones of Wapping.  So, with this man.  He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that’s what he
      is, in English.’</p>
     <p>‘It’s all the same to me what he is or what he is not, whether in English or whether in
      French,’ retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers, facing about.  ‘I am telling your friend what’s the
      fact; if you don’t like to hear it, you can avail yourself of the open air.  You give it mouth
      enough, you do; but give it mouth in your own building at least,’ remonstrated E. W. B. with
      stern irony.  ‘Don’t give it mouth in this building, till you’re called upon.  You have got
      some building of your own I dare say, now?’</p>
     <p>‘Perhaps so,’ replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his money and laughing.</p>
     <p>‘Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?’ said Childers.  ‘Because
      this isn’t a strong building, and too much of you might bring it down!’</p>
     <p>Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from him, as from a man finally
      disposed of, to Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was seen to slip out
      himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm. 
      She will never believe it of him, but he has cut away and left her.’</p>
     <p>‘Pray,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘why will she never believe it of him?’</p>
     <p>‘Because those two were one.  Because they were never asunder.  Because, up to this time, he
      seemed to dote upon her,’ said Childers, taking a step or two to look into the empty trunk. 
      Both Mr. Childers and Master Kidderminster walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider
      apart than the general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being stiff in the
      knees.  This walk was common to all the male members of Sleary’s company, and was understood
      to express, that they were always on horseback.</p>
     <p>‘Poor Sissy!  He had better have apprenticed her,’ said Childers, giving his hair another
      shake, as he looked up from the empty box.  ‘Now, he leaves her without anything to take
      to.’</p>
     <p>‘It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express that opinion,’
      returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly.</p>
     <p>‘<hi>I</hi> never apprenticed?  I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!  Indeed?’ said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been defrauded of his good
      opinion.  ‘I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to — ’</p>
     <p>‘Idleness,’ Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh.  ‘No, by the Lord Harry!  Nor I!’</p>
     <p>‘Her father always had it in his head,’ resumed Childers, feigning unconsciousness of Mr.
      Bounderby’s existence, ‘that she was to be taught the deuce-and-all of education.  How it got
      into his head, I can’t say; I can only say that it never got out.  He has been picking up a
      bit of reading for her, here — and a bit of writing for her, there — and a bit of ciphering
      for her, somewhere else — these seven years.’</p>
     <p>Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked his face and chin,
      and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little hope, at Mr. Gradgrind.  From the first he
      had sought to conciliate that gentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl.</p>
     <p>‘When Sissy got into the school here,’ he pursued, ‘her father was as pleased as Punch.  I
      couldn’t altogether make out why, myself, as we were not stationary here, being but comers and
      goers anywhere.  I suppose, however, he had this move in his mind — he was always half-cracked
      — and then considered her provided for.  If you should happen to have looked in to-night, for
      the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service,’ said Mr.
      Childers, stroking his face again, and repeating his look, ‘it would be very fortunate and
      well-timed; very fortunate and well-timed.’</p>
     <p>‘On the contrary,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘I came to tell him that her connections made
      her not an object for the school, and that she must not attend any more.  Still, if her father
      really has left her, without any connivance on her part — Bounderby, let me have a word with
      you.’</p>
     <p>Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian walk, to the landing
      outside the door, and there stood stroking his face, and softly whistling.  While thus
      engaged, he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby’s voice as ‘No.  <hi>I</hi> say no.  I
      advise you not.  I say by no means.’  While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower
      tone the words, ‘But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which has been the
      subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of
      view.’</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary’s company gradually gathered together from the
      upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from standing about, talking in low voices to
      one another and to Mr. Childers, gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  There
      were two or three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands, and their
      two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children, who did the fairy business when
      required.  The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of
      another of the families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often made a
      pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for the
      base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and
      balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.  All
      the mothers could (and did) dance, upon the slack wire and the tight-rope, and perform rapid
      acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all particular in respect of showing their
      legs; and one of them, alone in a Greek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came
      to.  They all assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their
      private dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic arrangements, and the combined
      literature of the whole company would have produced but a poor letter on any subject.  Yet
      there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude
      for any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity one another,
      deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much generous construction, as the
      every-day virtues of any class of people in the world.</p>
     <p>Last of all appeared Mr. Sleary: a stout man as already mentioned, with one fixed eye, and
      one loose eye, a voice (if it can be called so) like the efforts of a broken old pair of
      bellows, a flabby surface, and a muddled head which was never sober and never drunk.</p>
     <p>‘Thquire!’ said Mr. Sleary, who was troubled with asthma, and whose breath came far too
      thick and heavy for the letter s, ‘Your thervant!  Thith ith a bad piethe of bithnith, thith
      ith.  You’ve heard of my Clown and hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed?’</p>
     <p>He addressed Mr. Gradgrind, who answered ‘Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, Thquire,’ he returned, taking off his hat, and rubbing the lining with his
      pocket-handkerchief, which he kept inside for the purpose.  ‘Ith it your intenthion to do
      anything for the poor girl, Thquire?’</p>
     <p>‘I shall have something to propose to her when she comes back,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘Glad to hear it, Thquire.  Not that I want to get rid of the child, any more than I want to
      thtand in her way.  I’m willing to take her prentith, though at her age ith late.  My voithe
      ith a little huthky, Thquire, and not eathy heard by them ath don’t know me; but if you’d been
      chilled and heated, heated and chilled, chilled and heated in the ring when you wath young,
      ath often ath I have been, <hi>your</hi> voithe wouldn’t have lathted out, Thquire, no more
      than mine.’</p>
     <p>‘I dare say not,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘What thall it be, Thquire, while you wait?  Thall it be Therry?  Give it a name, Thquire!’
      said Mr. Sleary, with hospitable ease.</p>
     <p>‘Nothing for me, I thank you,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘Don’t thay nothing, Thquire.  What doth your friend thay?  If you haven’t took your feed
      yet, have a glath of bitterth.’</p>
     <p>Here his daughter Josephine — a pretty fair-haired girl of eighteen, who had been tied on a
      horse at two years old, and had made a will at twelve, which she always carried about with
      her, expressive of her dying desire to be drawn to the grave by the two piebald ponies —
      cried, ‘Father, hush! she has come back!’  Then came Sissy Jupe, running into the room as she
      had run out of it.  And when she saw them all assembled, and saw their looks, and saw no
      father there, she broke into a most deplorable cry, and took refuge on the bosom of the most
      accomplished tight-rope lady (herself in the family-way), who knelt down on the floor to nurse
      her, and to weep over her.</p>
     <p>‘Ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,’ said Sleary.</p>
     <p>‘O my dear father, my good kind father, where are you gone?  You are gone to try to do me
      some good, I know!  You are gone away for my sake, I am sure!  And how miserable and helpless
      you will be without me, poor, poor father, until you come back!’  It was so pathetic to hear
      her saying many things of this kind, with her face turned upward, and her arms stretched out
      as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it, that no one spoke a word
      until Mr. Bounderby (growing impatient) took the case in hand.</p>
     <p>‘Now, good people all,’ said he, ‘this is wanton waste of time.  Let the girl understand the
      fact.  Let her take it from me, if you like, who have been run away from, myself.  Here,
      what’s your name!  Your father has absconded — deserted you — and you mustn’t expect to see
      him again as long as you live.’</p>
     <p>They cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and were in that advanced state of
      degeneracy on the subject, that instead of being impressed by the speaker’s strong common
      sense, they took it in extraordinary dudgeon.  The men muttered ‘Shame!’ and the women
      ‘Brute!’ and Sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to Mr.
      Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘I tell you what, Thquire.  To thpeak plain to you, my opinion ith that you had better cut
      it thort, and drop it.  They’re a very good natur’d people, my people, but they’re accuthtomed
      to be quick in their movementh; and if you don’t act upon my advithe, I’m damned if I don’t
      believe they’ll pith you out o’ winder.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, Mr. Gradgrind found an opening for
      his eminently practical exposition of the subject.</p>
     <p>‘It is of no moment,’ said he, ‘whether this person is to be expected back at any time, or
      the contrary.  He is gone away, and there is no present expectation of his return.  That, I
      believe, is agreed on all hands.’</p>
     <p>‘Thath agreed, Thquire.  Thick to that!’  From Sleary.</p>
     <p>‘Well then.  I, who came here to inform the father of the poor girl, Jupe, that she could
      not be received at the school any more, in consequence of there being practical objections,
      into which I need not enter, to the reception there of the children of persons so employed, am
      prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal.  I am willing to take charge of
      you, Jupe, and to educate you, and provide for you.  The only condition (over and above your
      good behaviour) I make is, that you decide now, at once, whether to accompany me or remain
      here.  Also, that if you accompany me now, it is understood that you communicate no more with
      any of your friends who are here present.  These observations comprise the whole of the
      case.’</p>
     <p>‘At the thame time,’ said Sleary, ‘I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of
      the banner may be equally theen.  If you like, Thethilia, to be prentitht, you know the natur
      of the work and you know your companionth.  Emma Gordon, in whothe lap you’re a lying at
      prethent, would be a mother to you, and Joth’phine would be a thithter to you.  I don’t
      pretend to be of the angel breed myself, and I don’t thay but what, when you mith’d your tip,
      you’d find me cut up rough, and thwear an oath or two at you.  But what I thay, Thquire, ith,
      that good tempered or bad tempered, I never did a horthe a injury yet, no more than thwearing
      at him went, and that I don’t expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of life, with a
      rider.  I never wath much of a Cackler, Thquire, and I have thed my thay.’</p>
     <p>The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind, who received it with a grave
      inclination of his head, and then remarked:</p>
     <p>‘The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in the way of influencing your decision, is,
      that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education, and that even your father
      himself (from what I understand) appears, on your behalf, to have known and felt that
      much.’</p>
     <p>The last words had a visible effect upon her.  She stopped in her wild crying, a little
      detached herself from Emma Gordon, and turned her face full upon her patron.  The whole
      company perceived the force of the change, and drew a long breath together, that plainly said,
      ‘she will go!’</p>
     <p>‘Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe,’ Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her; ‘I say no more.  Be
      sure you know your own mind!’</p>
     <p>‘When father comes back,’ cried the girl, bursting into tears again after a minute’s
      silence, ‘how will he ever find me if I go away!’</p>
     <p>‘You may be quite at ease,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the whole matter like
      a sum: ‘you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.  In such a case, your father, I
      apprehend, must find out Mr. — ’</p>
     <p>‘Thleary.  Thath my name, Thquire.  Not athamed of it.  Known all over England, and alwayth
      paythe ith way.’</p>
     <p>‘Must find out Mr. Sleary, who would then let him know where you went.  I should have no
      power of keeping you against his wish, and he would have no difficulty, at any time, in
      finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.  I am well known.’</p>
     <p>‘Well known,’ assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his loose eye.  ‘You’re one of the thort,
      Thquire, that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe.  But never mind that at
      prethent.’</p>
     <p>There was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands before her face,
      ‘Oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me go away before I break my heart!’</p>
     <p>The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together — it was soon done, for
      they were not many — and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them.  Sissy
      sat all the time upon the ground, still sobbing, and covering her eyes.  Mr. Gradgrind and his
      friend Bounderby stood near the door, ready to take her away.  Mr. Sleary stood in the middle
      of the room, with the male members of the company about him, exactly as he would have stood in
      the centre of the ring during his daughter Josephine’s performance.  He wanted nothing but his
      whip.</p>
     <p>The basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and smoothed her disordered
      hair, and put it on.  Then they pressed about her, and bent over her in very natural
      attitudes, kissing and embracing her: and brought the children to take leave of her; and were
      a tender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women altogether.</p>
     <p>‘Now, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘If you are quite determined, come!’</p>
     <p>But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet, and every one of them
      had to unfold his arms (for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found
      themselves near Sleary), and give her a parting kiss — Master Kidderminster excepted, in whose
      young nature there was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to have
      harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.  Mr. Sleary was reserved until the
      last.  Opening his arms wide he took her by both her hands, and would have sprung her up and
      down, after the riding-master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from
      a rapid act; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him crying.</p>
     <p>‘Good-bye, my dear!’ said Sleary.  ‘You’ll make your fortun, I hope, and none of our poor
      folkth will ever trouble you, I’ll pound it.  I with your father hadn’t taken hith dog with
      him; ith a ill-conwenienth to have the dog out of the billth.  But on thecond thoughth, he
      wouldn’t have performed without hith mathter, tho ith ath broad ath ith long!’</p>
     <p>With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye, surveyed his company with his
      loose one, kissed her, shook his head, and handed her to Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse.</p>
     <p>‘There the ith, Thquire,’ he said, sweeping her with a professional glance as if she were
      being adjusted in her seat, ‘and the’ll do you juthtithe.  Good-bye, Thethilia!’</p>
     <p>‘Good-bye, Cecilia!’  ‘Good-bye, Sissy!’  ‘God bless you, dear!’  In a variety of voices
      from all the room.</p>
     <p>But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her bosom, and he now
      interposed with ‘Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large to carry; it will be of no uthe to you
      now.  Give it to me!’</p>
     <p>‘No, no!’ she said, in another burst of tears.  ‘Oh, no!  Pray let me keep it for father
      till he comes back!  He will want it when he comes back.  He had never thought of going away,
      when he sent me for it.  I must keep it for him, if you please!’</p>
     <p>‘Tho be it, my dear.  (You thee how it ith, Thquire!)  Farewell, Thethilia!  My latht wordth
      to you ith thith, Thtick to the termth of your engagement, be obedient to the Thquire, and
      forget uth.  But if, when you’re grown up and married and well off, you come upon any
      horthe-riding ever, don’t be hard upon it, don’t be croth with it, give it a Bethpeak if you
      can, and think you might do wurth.  People mutht be amuthed, Thquire, thomehow,’ continued
      Sleary, rendered more pursy than ever, by so much talking; ‘they can’t be alwayth a working,
      nor yet they can’t be alwayth a learning.  Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht.  I’ve got my
      living out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I conthider that I lay down the
      philothophy of the thubject when I thay to you, Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the
      wurtht!’</p>
     <p>The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the fixed eye of Philosophy
      — and its rolling eye, too — soon lost the three figures and the basket in the darkness of the
      street.</p>

     <head>p. 33CHAPTER VII MRS. SPARSIT</head>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his establishment, in
      consideration of a certain annual stipend.  Mrs. Sparsit was this lady’s name; and she was a
      prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby’s car, as it rolled along in triumph with the
      Bully of humility inside.</p>
     <p>For, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly connected.  She had a
      great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers.  Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom
      she was the relict, had been by the mother’s side what Mrs. Sparsit still called ‘a Powler.’ 
      Strangers of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not to know
      what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might be a business, or a political
      party, or a profession of faith.  The better class of minds, however, did not need to be
      informed that the Powlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly far
      back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves — which they had rather
      frequently done, as respected horse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the
      Insolvent Debtors’ Court.</p>
     <p>The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother’s side a Powler, married this lady, being by the
      father’s side a Scadgers.  Lady Scadgers (an immensely fat old woman, with an inordinate
      appetite for butcher’s meat, and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for
      fourteen years) contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age, and chiefly
      noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long slim props, and surmounted by no
      head worth mentioning.  He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he
      came into it, and spent it twice over immediately afterwards.  Thus, when he died, at
      twenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he did not leave his
      widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances. 
      That bereaved lady, fifteen years older than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only
      relative, Lady Scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain herself,
      went out at a salary.  And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian style
      of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby’s tea
      as he took his breakfast.</p>
     <p>If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as
      a feature in his state-processions, he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he
      habitually did.  Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so
      it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit’s.  In the measure that he would not allow his own
      youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit’s
      juvenile career with every possible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all
      over that lady’s path.  ‘And yet, sir,’ he would say, ‘how does it turn out after all?  Why
      here she is at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred, which she is pleased to term handsome),
      keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown!’</p>
     <p>Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties took it up, and
      handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.  It was one of the most exasperating
      attributes of Bounderby, that he not only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to
      sing them.  There was a moral infection of clap-trap in him.  Strangers, modest enough
      elsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a rampant way, of
      Bounderby.  They made him out to be the Royal arms, the Union-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull,
      Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights, An Englishman’s house is his castle, Church and State, and
      God save the Queen, all put together.  And as often (and it was very often) as an orator of
      this kind brought into his peroration,</p>
     <quote>
      <p>‘Princes and lords may flourish or may fade, A breath can make them, as a breath has
       made,’</p></quote>
     <p> — it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he had heard of Mrs.
      Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you are unusually slow, sir, with your breakfast this
      morning.’</p>
     <p>‘Why, ma’am,’ he returned, ‘I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind’s whim;’ Tom Gradgrind, for a
      bluff independent manner of speaking — as if somebody were always endeavouring to bribe him
      with immense sums to say Thomas, and he wouldn’t; ‘Tom Gradgrind’s whim, ma’am, of bringing up
      the tumbling-girl.’</p>
     <p>‘The girl is now waiting to know,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘whether she is to go straight to the
      school, or up to the Lodge.’</p>
     <p>‘She must wait, ma’am,’ answered Bounderby, ‘till I know myself.  We shall have Tom
      Gradgrind down here presently, I suppose.  If he should wish her to remain here a day or two
      longer, of course she can, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘Of course she can if you wish it, Mr. Bounderby.’</p>
     <p>‘I told him I would give her a shake-down here, last night, in order that he might sleep on
      it before he decided to let her have any association with Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed, Mr. Bounderby?  Very thoughtful of you!’  Mrs. Sparsit’s Coriolanian nose underwent
      a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of
      tea.</p>
     <p>‘It’s tolerably clear to <hi>me</hi>,’ said Bounderby, ‘that the little puss can get small
      good out of such companionship.’</p>
     <p>‘Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am, I’m speaking of Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘Your observation being limited to “little puss,”’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘and there being two
      little girls in question, I did not know which might be indicated by that expression.’</p>
     <p>‘Louisa,’ repeated Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Louisa, Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘You are quite another father to Louisa, sir.’  Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea; and, as
      she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup, rather looked as if her
      classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods.</p>
     <p>‘If you had said I was another father to Tom — young Tom, I mean, not my friend Tom
      Gradgrind — you might have been nearer the mark.  I am going to take young Tom into my
      office.  Going to have him under my wing, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed?  Rather young for that, is he not, sir?’  Mrs. Sparsit’s ‘sir,’ in addressing Mr.
      Bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting consideration for herself in the use, than
      honouring him.</p>
     <p>‘I’m not going to take him at once; he is to finish his educational cramming before then,’
      said Bounderby.  ‘By the Lord Harry, he’ll have enough of it, first and last!  He’d open his
      eyes, that boy would, if he knew how empty of learning <hi>my</hi> young maw was, at his time
      of life.’  Which, by the by, he probably did know, for he had heard of it often enough.  ‘But
      it’s extraordinary the difficulty I have on scores of such subjects, in speaking to any one on
      equal terms.  Here, for example, I have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers. 
      Why, what do <hi>you</hi> know about tumblers?  At the time when, to have been a tumbler in
      the mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in the lottery to me, you
      were at the Italian Opera.  You were coming out of the Italian Opera, ma’am, in white satin
      and jewels, a blaze of splendour, when I hadn’t a penny to buy a link to light you.’</p>
     <p>‘I certainly, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a dignity serenely mournful, ‘was familiar
      with the Italian Opera at a very early age.’</p>
     <p>‘Egad, ma’am, so was I,’ said Bounderby, ‘ — with the wrong side of it.  A hard bed the
      pavement of its Arcade used to make, I assure you.  People like you, ma’am, accustomed from
      infancy to lie on Down feathers, have no idea <hi>how</hi> hard a paving-stone is, without
      trying it.  No, no, it’s of no use my talking to <hi>you</hi> about tumblers.  I should speak
      of foreign dancers, and the West End of London, and May Fair, and lords and ladies and
      honourables.’</p>
     <p>‘I trust, sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent resignation, ‘it is not necessary that
      you should do anything of that kind.  I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the
      changes of life.  If I have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences,
      and can scarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that, since I believe it is a
      general sentiment.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am,’ said her patron, ‘perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like
      to hear, in his own unpolished way, what Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown, has gone through.  But
      you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury, yourself.  Come, ma’am, you know you
      were born in the lap of luxury.’</p>
     <p>‘I do not, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of her head, ‘deny it.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with his back to the fire, looking
      at her; she was such an enhancement of his position.</p>
     <p>‘And you were in crack society.  Devilish high society,’ he said, warming his legs.</p>
     <p>‘It is true, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affectation of humility the very opposite
      of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it.</p>
     <p>‘You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,’ said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon her.  ‘It is
      unquestionably true.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs in his great
      satisfaction and laughed aloud.  Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced, he received the
      former with a shake of the hand, and the latter with a kiss.</p>
     <p>‘Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>Certainly.  So Jupe was sent there.  On coming in, she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby, and to
      his friend Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs.
      Sparsit.  Observing this, the blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make:</p>
     <p>‘Now, I tell you what, my girl.  The name of that lady by the teapot, is Mrs. Sparsit.  That
      lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a highly connected lady.  Consequently, if
      ever you come again into any room in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you don’t
      behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner.  Now, I don’t care a button what you
      do to <hi>me</hi>, because I don’t affect to be anybody.  So far from having high connections
      I have no connections at all, and I come of the scum of the earth.  But towards that lady, I
      do care what you do; and you shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not
      come here.’</p>
     <p>‘I hope, Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, ‘that this was merely an
      oversight.’</p>
     <p>‘My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,’ said Bounderby, ‘that this was merely an
      oversight.  Very likely.  However, as you are aware, ma’am, I don’t allow of even oversights
      towards you.’</p>
     <p>‘You are very good indeed, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head with her State
      humility.  ‘It is not worth speaking of.’</p>
     <p>Sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in her eyes, was now
      waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind.  She stood looking intently at him,
      and Louisa stood coldly by, with her eyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:</p>
     <p>‘Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you are not in attendance
      at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind, who is rather an invalid.  I have explained
      to Miss Louisa — this is Miss Louisa — the miserable but natural end of your late career; and
      you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not to be
      referred to any more.  From this time you begin your history.  You are, at present, ignorant,
      I know.’</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 38"/>‘Yes, sir, very,’ she answered, curtseying.</p>
     <p>‘I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated; and you will be a
      living proof to all who come into communication with you, of the advantages of the training
      you will receive.  You will be reclaimed and formed.  You have been in the habit now of
      reading to your father, and those people I found you among, I dare say?’ said Mr. Gradgrind,
      beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping his voice.</p>
     <p>‘Only to father and Merrylegs, sir.  At least I mean to father, when Merrylegs was always
      there.’</p>
     <p>‘Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, with a passing frown.  ‘I don’t ask about
      him.  I understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father?’</p>
     <p>‘O, yes, sir, thousands of times.  They were the happiest — O, of all the happy times we had
      together, sir!’</p>
     <p>It was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her.</p>
     <p>‘And what,’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, ‘did you read to your father,
      Jupe?’</p>
     <p>‘About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the Genies,’ she sobbed out;
      ‘and about — ’</p>
     <p>‘Hush!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that is enough.  Never breathe a word of such destructive
      nonsense any more.  Bounderby, this is a case for rigid training, and I shall observe it with
      interest.’</p>
     <p>‘Well,’ returned Mr. Bounderby, ‘I have given you my opinion already, and I shouldn’t do as
      you do.  But, very well, very well.  Since you are bent upon it, <hi>very</hi> well!’</p>
     <p>So, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to Stone Lodge, and on
      the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.  And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily
      pursuits.  And Mrs. Sparsit got behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that
      retreat, all the evening.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VIII NEVER WONDER</head>
     <p>Let us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune.</p>
     <p>When she was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been overheard to begin a conversation
      with her brother one day, by saying ‘Tom, I wonder’ — upon which Mr. Gradgrind, who was the
      person overhearing, stepped forth into the light and said, ‘Louisa, never wonder!’</p>
     <p>Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without
      stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections.  Never wonder.  By means of
      addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never
      wonder.  Bring to me, says M’Choakumchild, yonder baby just able to walk, and I will engage
      that it shall never wonder.</p>
     <p>Now, besides very many babies just able to walk, there happened to be in Coketown a
      considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite
      world, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years and more.  These portentous infants being alarming
      creatures to stalk about in any human society, the eighteen denominations incessantly
      scratched one another’s faces and pulled one another’s hair by way of agreeing on the steps to
      be taken for their improvement — which they never did; a surprising circumstance, when the
      happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered.  Still, although they differed in
      every other particular, conceivable and inconceivable (especially inconceivable), they were
      pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were never to wonder.  Body number
      one, said they must take everything on trust.  Body number two, said they must take everything
      on political economy.  Body number three, wrote leaden little books for them, showing how the
      good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank, and the bad grown-up baby invariably
      got transported.  Body number four, under dreary pretences of being droll (when it was very
      melancholy indeed), made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge, into
      which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled.  But, all the bodies
      agreed that they were never to wonder.</p>
     <p>There was a library in Coketown, to which general access was easy.  Mr. Gradgrind greatly
      tormented his mind about what the people read in this library: a point whereon little rivers
      of tabular statements periodically flowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements, which
      no diver ever got to any depth in and came up sane.  It was a disheartening circumstance, but
      a melancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in wondering.  They wondered about human
      nature, human passions, human hopes and fears, the struggles, triumphs and defeats, the cares
      and joys and sorrows, the lives and deaths of common men and women!  They sometimes, after
      fifteen hours’ work, sat down to read mere fables about men and women, more or less like
      themselves, and about children, more or less like their own.  They took De Foe to their
      bosoms, instead of Euclid, and seemed to be on the whole more comforted by Goldsmith than by
      Cocker.  Mr. Gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this eccentric sum,
      and he never could make out how it yielded this unaccountable product.</p>
     <p>‘I am sick of my life, Loo.  I, hate it altogether, and I hate everybody except you,’ said
      the unnatural young Thomas Gradgrind in the hair-cutting chamber at twilight.</p>
     <p>‘You don’t hate Sissy, Tom?’</p>
     <p>‘I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe.  And she hates me,’ said Tom, moodily.</p>
     <p>‘No, she does not, Tom, I am sure!’</p>
     <p>‘She must,’ said Tom.  ‘She must just hate and detest the whole set-out of us.  They’ll
      bother her head off, I think, before they have done with her.  Already she’s getting as pale
      as wax, and as heavy as — I am.’</p>
     <p>Young Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a chair before the fire, with his
      arms on the back, and his sulky face on his arms.  His sister sat in the darker corner by the
      fireside, now looking at him, now looking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the
      hearth.</p>
     <p>‘As to me,’ said Tom, tumbling his hair all manner of ways with his sulky hands, ‘I am a
      Donkey, that’s what <hi>I</hi> am.  I am as obstinate as one, I am more stupid than one, I get
      as much pleasure as one, and I should like to kick like one.’</p>
     <p>‘Not me, I hope, Tom?’</p>
     <p>‘No, Loo; I wouldn’t hurt <hi>you</hi>.  I made an exception of you at first.  I don’t know
      what this — jolly old — Jaundiced Jail,’ Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary
      and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the
      strong alliteration of this one, ‘would be without you.’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed, Tom?  Do you really and truly say so?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, of course I do.  What’s the use of talking about it!’ returned Tom, chafing his face
      on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit.</p>
     <p>‘Because, Tom,’ said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, ‘as I get older,
      and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that
      I can’t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do.  I don’t know what other girls
      know.  I can’t play to you, or sing to you.  I can’t talk to you so as to lighten your mind,
      for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a
      relief to you to talk about, when you are tired.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, no more do I.  I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule too, which you’re
      not.  If father was determined to make me either a Prig or a Mule, and I am not a Prig, why,
      it stands to reason, I must be a Mule.  And so I am,’ said Tom, desperately.</p>
     <p>‘It’s a great pity,’ said Louisa, after another pause, and speaking thoughtfully out of her
      dark corner: ‘it’s a great pity, Tom.  It’s very unfortunate for both of us.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!  You,’ said Tom; ‘you are a girl, Loo, and a girl comes out of it better than a boy
      does.  I don’t miss anything in you.  You are the only pleasure I have — you can brighten even
      this place — and you can always lead me as you like.’</p>
     <p>‘You are a dear brother, Tom; and while you think I can do such things, I don’t so much mind
      knowing better.  Though I do know better, Tom, and am very sorry for it.’  She came and kissed
      him, and went back into her corner again.</p>
     <p>‘I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much about,’ said Tom, spitefully setting
      his teeth, ‘and all the Figures, and all the people who found them out: and I wish I could put
      a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them, and blow them all up together!  However, when I go
      to live with old Bounderby, I’ll have my revenge.’</p>
     <p>‘Your revenge, Tom?’</p>
     <p>‘I mean, I’ll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and hear something. 
      I’ll recompense myself for the way in which I have been brought up.’</p>
     <p>‘But don’t disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom.  Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks, and
      is a great deal rougher, and not half so kind.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!’ said Tom, laughing; ‘I don’t mind that.  I shall very well know how to manage and
      smooth old Bounderby!’</p>
     <p>Their shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the high presses in the room were all
      blended together on the wall and on the ceiling, as if the brother and sister were overhung by
      a dark cavern.  Or, a fanciful imagination — if such treason could have been there — might
      have made it out to be the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with their
      future.</p>
     <p>‘What is your great mode of smoothing and managing, Tom?  Is it a secret?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!’ said Tom, ‘if it is a secret, it’s not far off.  It’s you.  You are his little pet,
      you are his favourite; he’ll do anything for you.  When he says to me what I don’t like, I
      shall say to him, “My sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed, Mr. Bounderby.  She always
      used to tell me she was sure you would be easier with me than this.”  That’ll bring him about,
      or nothing will.’</p>
     <p>After waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom wearily relapsed into the
      present time, and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his chair, and rumpled
      his head more and more, until he suddenly looked up, and asked:</p>
     <p>‘Have you gone to sleep, Loo?’</p>
     <p>‘No, Tom.  I am looking at the fire.’</p>
     <p>‘You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find,’ said Tom.  ‘Another of the
      advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.’</p>
     <p>‘Tom,’ enquired his sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she were reading what she
      asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written there, ‘do you look forward with any
      satisfaction to this change to Mr. Bounderby’s?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, there’s one thing to be said of it,’ returned Tom, pushing his chair from him, and
      standing up; ‘it will be getting away from home.’</p>
     <p>‘There is one thing to be said of it,’ Louisa repeated in her former curious tone; ‘it will
      be getting away from home.  Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to leave you here.  But
      I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take with me
      some advantage of your influence, than where I should lose it altogether.  Don’t you see?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, Tom.’</p>
     <p>The answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it, that Tom went and
      leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her, from her
      point of view, and see what he could make of it.</p>
     <p>‘Except that it is a fire,’ said Tom, ‘it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else
      looks.  What do you see in it?  Not a circus?’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t see anything in it, Tom, particularly.  But since I have been looking at it, I have
      been wondering about you and me, grown up.’</p>
     <p>‘Wondering again!’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>‘I have such unmanageable thoughts,’ returned his sister, ‘that they <hi>will</hi>
      wonder.’</p>
     <p>‘Then I beg of you, Louisa,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, who had opened the door without being
      heard, ‘to do nothing of that description, for goodness’ sake, you inconsiderate girl, or I
      shall never hear the last of it from your father.  And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my
      poor head continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and whose
      education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his sister to wonder, when he
      knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it.’</p>
     <p>Louisa denied Tom’s participation in the offence; but her mother stopped her with the
      conclusive answer, ‘Louisa, don’t tell me, in my state of health; for unless you had been
      encouraged, it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it.’</p>
     <p>‘I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the
      fire, and whitening and dying.  It made me think, after all, how short my life would be, and
      how little I could hope to do in it.’</p>
     <p>‘Nonsense!’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost energetic.  ‘Nonsense!  Don’t stand there
      and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to
      <pb n=" 43"/>my face, when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father’s ears
      I should never hear the last of it.  After all the trouble that has been taken with you! 
      After the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you have seen!  After I have heard
      you myself, when the whole of my right side has been benumbed, going on with your master about
      combustion, and calcination, and calorification, and I may say every kind of ation that could
      drive a poor invalid distracted, to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and
      ashes!  I wish,’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, taking a chair, and discharging her strongest point
      before succumbing under these mere shadows of facts, ‘yes, I really <hi>do</hi> wish that I
      had never had a family, and then you would have known what it was to do without me!’</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER IX SISSY’S PROGRESS</head>
     <p>Sissy Jupe had not an easy time of it, between Mr. M’Choakumchild and Mrs.
      Gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months of her probation, to run
      away.  It hailed facts all day long so very hard, and life in general was opened to her as
      such a closely ruled ciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run away, but for only one
      restraint.</p>
     <p>It is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the result of no arithmetical process,
      was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation, and went dead against any table of
      probabilities that any Actuary would have drawn up from the premises.  The girl believed that
      her father had not deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and in the
      faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she was.</p>
     <p>The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation, rejecting the superior
      comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis, that her father was an unnatural vagabond,
      filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity.  Yet, what was to be done?  M’Choakumchild reported that she
      had a very dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea of the globe, she
      took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements; that she was extremely slow
      in the acquisition of dates, unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith;
      that she would burst into tears on being required (by the mental process) immediately to name
      the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at fourteen-pence halfpenny; that she was
      as low down, in the school, as low could be; that after eight weeks of induction into the
      elements of Political Economy, she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three feet
      high, for returning to the question, ‘What is the first principle of this science?’ the absurd
      answer, ‘To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was very bad; that it showed the
      necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book,
      report, and tabular statements A to Z; and that Jupe ‘must be kept to it.’  So Jupe was kept
      to it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.</p>
     <p>‘It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!’ she said, one night, when Louisa had
      endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day something clearer to her.</p>
     <p>‘Do you think so?’</p>
     <p>‘I should know so much, Miss Louisa.  All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy
      then.’</p>
     <p>‘You might not be the better for it, Sissy.’</p>
     <p>Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, ‘I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.’  To
      which Miss Louisa answered, ‘I don’t know that.’</p>
     <p>There had been so little communication between these two — both because life at Stone Lodge
      went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and
      because of the prohibition relative to Sissy’s past career — that they were still almost
      strangers.  Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa’s face, was uncertain
      whether to say more or to remain silent.</p>
     <p>‘You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can ever be,’ Louisa
      resumed.  ‘You are pleasanter to yourself, than <hi>I</hi> am to <hi>my</hi>self.’</p>
     <p>‘But, if you please, Miss Louisa,’ Sissy pleaded, ‘I am — O so stupid!’</p>
     <p>Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser by-and-by.</p>
     <p>‘You don’t know,’ said Sissy, half crying, ‘what a stupid girl I am.  All through school
      hours I make mistakes.  Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild call me up, over and over again, regularly
      to make mistakes.  I can’t help them.  They seem to come natural to me.’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?’</p>
     <p>‘O no!’ she eagerly returned.  ‘They know everything.’</p>
     <p>‘Tell me some of your mistakes.’</p>
     <p>‘I am almost ashamed,’ said Sissy, with reluctance.  ‘But to-day, for instance, Mr.
      M’Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural Prosperity.’</p>
     <p>‘National, I think it must have been,’ observed Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, it was. — But isn’t it the same?’ she timidly asked.</p>
     <p>‘You had better say, National, as he said so,’ returned Louisa, with her dry reserve.</p>
     <p>‘National Prosperity.  And he said, Now, this schoolroom is a Nation.  And in this nation,
      there are fifty millions of money.  Isn’t this a prosperous nation?  Girl number twenty, isn’t
      this a prosperous nation, and a’n’t you in a thriving state?’</p>
     <p>‘What did you say?’ asked Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Miss Louisa, I said I didn’t know.  I thought I couldn’t know whether it was a prosperous
      nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or not, unless I knew who had got the
      money, and whether any of it was mine.  But that had nothing to do with it.  It was not in the
      figures at all,’ said Sissy, wiping her eyes.</p>
     <p>‘That was a great mistake of yours,’ observed Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now.  Then Mr. M’Choakumchild said he would try me again. 
      And he said, This schoolroom is an immense town, and in it there are a million of inhabitants,
      and only five-and-twenty are starved to death in the streets, in the course of a year.  What
      is your remark on that proportion?  And my remark was — for I couldn’t think of a better one —
      that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved, whether the others were a
      million, or a million million.  And that was wrong, too.’</p>
     <p>‘Of course it was.’</p>
     <p>‘Then Mr. M’Choakumchild said he would try me once more.  And he said, Here are the
      stutterings — ’</p>
     <p>‘Statistics,’ said Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, Miss Louisa — they always remind me of stutterings, and that’s another of my mistakes
      — of accidents upon the sea.  And I find (Mr. M’Choakumchild said) that in a given time a
      hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were
      drowned or burnt to death.  What is the percentage?  And I said, Miss;’ here Sissy fairly
      sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error; ‘I said it was
      nothing.’</p>
     <p>‘Nothing, Sissy?’</p>
     <p>‘Nothing, Miss — to the relations and friends of the people who were killed.  I shall never
      learn,’ said Sissy.  ‘And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much
      to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don’t
      like it.’</p>
     <p>Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it
      was raised again to glance at her face.  Then she asked:</p>
     <p>‘Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?’</p>
     <p>Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on
      forbidden ground, that Louisa added, ‘No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm
      could be found in such an innocent question.’</p>
     <p>‘No, Miss Louisa,’ answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; ‘father knows
      very little indeed.  It’s as much as he can do to write; and it’s more than people in general
      can do to read his writing.  Though it’s plain to <hi>me</hi>.’</p>
     <p>‘Your mother?’</p>
     <p>‘Father says she was quite a scholar.  She died when I was born.  She was;’ Sissy made the
      terrible communication nervously; ‘she was a dancer.’</p>
     <p>‘Did your father love her?’  Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering
      interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in
      solitary places.</p>
     <p>‘O yes!  As dearly as he loves me.  Father loved me, first, for her sake.  He carried me
      about with him when I was quite a baby.  We have never been asunder from that time.’</p>
     <p>‘Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?’</p>
     <p>‘Only for my good.  Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do.  When he left
      me for my good — he never would have left me for his own — I know he was almost broken-hearted
      with the trial.  He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.’</p>
     <p>‘Tell me more about him,’ said Louisa, ‘I will never ask you again.  Where did you
      live?’</p>
     <p>‘We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in. Father’s a;’ Sissy
      whispered the awful word, ‘a clown.’</p>
     <p>‘To make the people laugh?’ said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence.</p>
     <p>‘Yes.  But they wouldn’t laugh sometimes, and then father cried.  Lately, they very often
      wouldn’t laugh, and he used to come home despairing.  Father’s not like most.  Those who
      didn’t know him as well as I do, and didn’t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was
      not quite right.  Sometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt them,
      and shrunk up, when he was alone with me.  He was far, far timider than they thought!’</p>
     <p>‘And you were his comfort through everything?’</p>
     <p>She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face.  ‘I hope so, and father said I was.  It
      was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because he felt himself to be a poor, weak,
      ignorant, helpless man (those used to be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great
      deal, and be different from him.  I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he was very
      fond of that.  They were wrong books — I am never to speak of them here — but we didn’t know
      there was any harm in them.’</p>
     <p>‘And he liked them?’ said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this time.</p>
     <p>‘O very much!  They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm.  And often and often
      of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the
      lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off before it was finished.’</p>
     <p>‘And your father was always kind?  To the last?’ asked Louisa contravening the great
      principle, and wondering very much.</p>
     <p>‘Always, always!’ returned Sissy, clasping her hands.  ‘Kinder and kinder than I can tell. 
      He was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but Merrylegs.  Merrylegs;’ she whispered
      the awful fact; ‘is his performing dog.’</p>
     <p>‘Why was he angry with the dog?’ Louisa demanded.</p>
     <p>‘Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs
      of the two chairs and stand across them — which is one of his tricks.  He looked at father,
      and didn’t do it at once.  Everything of father’s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn’t
      pleased the public at all.  He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no
      compassion on him.  Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, “Father, father! 
      Pray don’t hurt the creature who is so fond of you!  O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!”  And
      he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in
      his arms, and the dog licked his face.’</p>
     <p>Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down
      beside her.</p>
     <p>‘Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy.  Now that I have asked you so much,
      tell me the end.  The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.’</p>
     <p>‘Dear Miss Louisa,’ said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; ‘I came home from the
      school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth.  And he sat
      rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain.  And I said, “Have you hurt yourself,
      father?” (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, “A little, my darling.”  And
      when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying.  The more I spoke
      to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but “My
      darling;” and “My love!”’</p>
     <p>Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring
      of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.</p>
     <p>‘I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,’ observed his sister.  ‘You have no occasion to go
      away; but don’t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh! very well!’ returned Tom.  ‘Only father has brought old Bounderby home, and I want you
      to come into the drawing-room.  Because if you come, there’s a good chance of old Bounderby’s
      asking me to dinner; and if you don’t, there’s none.’</p>
     <p>‘I’ll come directly.’</p>
     <p>‘I’ll wait for you,’ said Tom, ‘to make sure.’</p>
     <p>Sissy resumed in a lower voice.  ‘At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction
      again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and disgrace, and I
      should have done better without him all along.  I said all the affectionate things to him that
      came into my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him all about
      the school and everything that had been said and done there.  When I had no more left to tell,
      he put his arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many times.  Then he asked me to fetch
      some of the stuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best place,
      which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after kissing me again, he let me
      go.  When I had gone down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to
      him yet, and looked in at the door, and said, “Father dear, shall I take Merrylegs?”  Father
      shook his head and said, “No, Sissy, no; take nothing that’s known to be mine, my darling;”
      and I left him sitting by the fire.  Then the thought must have come upon him, poor, poor
      father! of going away to try something for my sake; for when I came back, he was gone.’</p>
     <p>‘I say!  Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!’ Tom remonstrated.</p>
     <p>‘There’s no more to tell, Miss Louisa.  I keep the nine oils ready for him, and I know he
      will come back.  Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind’s hand takes my breath away and
      blinds my eyes, for I think it comes from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father.  Mr. Sleary
      promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and I trust to him to keep his
      word.’</p>
     <p>‘Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!’ said Tom, with an impatient whistle.  ‘He’ll be off
      if you don’t look sharp!’</p>
     <p>After this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the presence of his family,
      and said in a faltering way, ‘I beg your pardon, sir, for being troublesome — but — have you
      had any letter yet about me?’  Louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it
      was, and look for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did.  And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly
      answered, ‘No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,’ the trembling of Sissy’s lip would be repeated in
      Louisa’s face, and her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door.  Mr. Gradgrind
      usually improved these occasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if Jupe had been
      properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles
      the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.  Yet it did seem (though not to him, for he saw
      nothing of it) as if fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 49"/>This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.  As to Tom, he was
      becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is usually at work on number
      one.  As to Mrs. Gradgrind, if she said anything on the subject, she would come a little way
      out of her wrappers, like a feminine dormouse, and say:</p>
     <p>‘Good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and worried by that girl Jupe’s so
      perseveringly asking, over and over again, about her tiresome letters!  Upon my word and
      honour I seem to be fated, and destined, and ordained, to live in the midst of things that I
      am never to hear the last of.  It really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it appears
      as if I never was to hear the last of anything!’</p>
     <p>At about this point, Mr. Gradgrind’s eye would fall upon her; and under the influence of
      that wintry piece of fact, she would become torpid again.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER X STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</head>
     <p>I <hi>entertain</hi> a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any people
      upon whom the sun shines.  I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy, as a reason why I
      would give them a little more play.</p>
     <p>In the hardest working part of Coketown; in the innermost fortifications of that ugly
      citadel, where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in;
      at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets,
      which had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man’s
      purpose, and the whole an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling, and pressing one
      another to death; in the last close nook of this great exhausted receiver, where the chimneys,
      for want of air to make a draught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked
      shapes, as though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be expected to be
      born in it; among the multitude of Coketown, generically called ‘the Hands,’ — a race who
      would have found more favour with some people, if Providence had seen fit to make them only
      hands, or, like the lower creatures of the seashore, only hands and stomachs — lived a certain
      Stephen Blackpool, forty years of age.</p>
     <p>Stephen looked older, but he had had a hard life.  It is said that every life has its roses
      and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a misadventure or mistake in Stephen’s case,
      whereby somebody else had become possessed of his roses, and he had become possessed of the
      same somebody else’s thorns in addition to his own.  He had known, to use his words, a peck of
      trouble.  He was usually called Old Stephen, in a kind of rough homage to the fact.</p>
     <p>A rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a pondering expression of face, and a
      hard-looking head sufficiently capacious, on which his iron-grey hair lay long and thin, Old
      Stephen might have passed for a particularly intelligent man in his condition.  Yet he was
      not.  He took no place among those remarkable ‘Hands,’ who, piecing together their broken
      intervals of leisure through many years, had mastered difficult sciences, and acquired a
      knowledge of most unlikely things.  He held no station among the Hands who could make speeches
      and carry on debates.  Thousands of his compeers could talk much better than he, at any time. 
      He was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity.  What more he was, or what
      else he had in him, if anything, let him show for himself.</p>
     <p>The lights in the great factories, which looked, when they were illuminated, like Fairy
      palaces — or the travellers by express-train said so — were all extinguished; and the bells
      had rung for knocking off for the night, and had ceased again; and the Hands, men and women,
      boy and girl, were clattering home.  Old Stephen was standing in the street, with the old
      sensation upon him which the stoppage of the machinery always produced — the sensation of its
      having worked and stopped in his own head.</p>
     <p>‘Yet I don’t see Rachael, still!’ said he.</p>
     <p>It was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him, with their shawls drawn over
      their bare heads and held close under their chins to keep the rain out.  He knew Rachael well,
      for a glance at any one of these groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there.  At
      last, there were no more to come; and then he turned away, saying in a tone of disappointment,
      ‘Why, then, ha’ missed her!’</p>
     <p>But, he had not gone the length of three streets, when he saw another of the shawled figures
      in advance of him, at which he looked so keenly that perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly
      reflected on the wet pavement — if he could have seen it without the figure itself moving
      along from lamp to lamp, brightening and fading as it went — would have been enough to tell
      him who was there.  Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer, he darted on until
      he was very near this figure, then fell into his former walk, and called ‘Rachael!’</p>
     <p>She turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp; and raising her hood a little, showed a
      quiet oval face, dark and rather delicate, irradiated by a pair of very gentle eyes, and
      further set off by the perfect order of her shining black hair.  It was not a face in its
      first bloom; she was a woman five and thirty years of age.</p>
     <p>‘Ah, lad!  ’Tis thou?’  When she had said this, with a smile which would have been quite
      expressed, though nothing of her had been seen but her pleasant eyes, she replaced her hood
      again, and they went on together.</p>
     <p>‘I thought thou wast ahind me, Rachael?’</p>
     <p>‘No.’</p>
     <p>‘Early t’night, lass?’</p>
     <p>‘’Times I’m a little early, Stephen! ’times a little late.  I’m never to be counted on,
      going home.’</p>
     <p>‘Nor going t’other way, neither, ’t seems to me, Rachael?’</p>
     <p>‘No, Stephen.’</p>
     <p>He looked at her with some disappointment in his face, but with a respectful and patient
      conviction that she must be right in whatever she did.  The expression was not lost upon her;
      she laid her hand lightly on his arm a moment as if to thank him for it.</p>
     <p>‘We are such true friends, lad, and such old friends, and getting to be such old folk,
      now.’</p>
     <p>‘No, Rachael, thou’rt as young as ever thou wast.’</p>
     <p>‘One of us would be puzzled how to get old, Stephen, without ’t other getting so too, both
      being alive,’ she answered, laughing; ‘but, anyways, we’re such old friends, and t’ hide a
      word of honest truth fro’ one another would be a sin and a pity.  ’Tis better not to walk too
      much together.  ’Times, yes!  ’Twould be hard, indeed, if ’twas not to be at all,’ she said,
      with a cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him.</p>
     <p>‘’Tis hard, anyways, Rachael.’</p>
     <p>‘Try to think not; and ’twill seem better.’</p>
     <p>‘I’ve tried a long time, and ’ta’nt got better.  But thou’rt right; ’t might mak fok talk,
      even of thee.  Thou hast been that to me, Rachael, through so many year: thou hast done me so
      much good, and heartened of me in that cheering way, that thy word is a law to me.  Ah, lass,
      and a bright good law!  Better than some real ones.’</p>
     <p>‘Never fret about them, Stephen,’ she answered quickly, and not without an anxious glance at
      his face.  ‘Let the laws be.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes,’ he said, with a slow nod or two.  ‘Let ’em be.  Let everything be.  Let all sorts
      alone.  ’Tis a muddle, and that’s aw.’</p>
     <p>‘Always a muddle?’ said Rachael, with another gentle touch upon his arm, as if to recall him
      out of the thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the long ends of his loose neckerchief as he
      walked along.  The touch had its instantaneous effect.  He let them fall, turned a smiling
      face upon her, and said, as he broke into a good-humoured laugh, ‘Ay, Rachael, lass, awlus a
      muddle.  That’s where I stick.  I come to the muddle many times and agen, and I never get
      beyond it.’</p>
     <p>They had walked some distance, and were near their own homes.  The woman’s was the first
      reached.  It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker (who
      turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black
      ladder, in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs
      might slide out of this working world by the windows.  She stopped at the corner, and putting
      her hand in his, wished him good night.</p>
     <p>‘Good night, dear lass; good night!’</p>
     <p>She went, with her neat figure and her sober womanly step, down the dark street, and he
      stood looking after her until she turned into one of the small houses.  There was not a
      flutter of her coarse shawl, perhaps, but had its interest in this man’s eyes; not a tone of
      her voice but had its echo in his innermost heart.</p>
     <p>When she was lost to his view, he pursued his homeward way, glancing up sometimes at the
      sky, where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly.  But, they were broken now, and the rain
      had ceased, and the moon shone, — looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep
      furnaces below, and casting Titanic shadows of the steam-engines at rest, upon the walls where
      they were lodged.  The man seemed to have brightened with the night, as he went on.</p>
     <p>His home, in such another street as the first, saving that it was narrower, was over a
      little shop.  How it came to pass that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy
      the wretched little toys, mixed up in its window with cheap newspapers and pork (there was a
      leg to be raffled for to-morrow-night), matters not here.  He took his end of candle from a
      shelf, lighted it at another end of candle on the counter, without disturbing the mistress of
      the shop who was asleep in her little room, and went upstairs into his lodging.</p>
     <p>It was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder under various tenants; but as neat, at
      present, as such a room could be.  A few books and writings were on an old bureau in a corner,
      the furniture was decent and sufficient, and, though the atmosphere was tainted, the room was
      clean.</p>
     <p>Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three-legged table standing there,
      he stumbled against something.  As he recoiled, looking down at it, it raised itself up into
      the form of a woman in a sitting attitude.</p>
     <p>‘Heaven’s mercy, woman!’ he cried, falling farther off from the figure.  ‘Hast thou come
      back again!’</p>
     <p>Such a woman!  A disabled, drunken creature, barely able to preserve her sitting posture by
      steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor, while the other was so purposeless in
      trying to
      <pb n=" 53"/>push away her tangled hair from her face, that it only blinded her the more with
      the dirt upon it.  A creature so foul to look at, in her tatters, stains and splashes, but so
      much fouler than that in her moral infamy, that it was a shameful thing even to see her.</p>
     <p>After an impatient oath or two, and some stupid clawing of herself with the hand not
      necessary to her support, she got her hair away from her eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight
      of him.  Then she sat swaying her body to and fro, and making gestures with her unnerved arm,
      which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her face was stolid
      and drowsy.</p>
     <p>‘Eigh, lad?  What, yo’r there?’  Some hoarse sounds meant for this, came mockingly out of
      her at last; and her head dropped forward on her breast.</p>
     <p>‘Back agen?’ she screeched, after some minutes, as if he had that moment said it.  ‘Yes! 
      And back agen.  Back agen ever and ever so often.  Back?  Yes, back.  Why not?’</p>
     <p>Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out, she scrambled up, and stood
      supporting herself with her shoulders against the wall; dangling in one hand by the string, a
      dunghill-fragment of a bonnet, and trying to look scornfully at him.</p>
     <p>‘I’ll sell thee off again, and I’ll sell thee off again, and I’ll sell thee off a score of
      times!’ she cried, with something between a furious menace and an effort at a defiant dance. 
      ‘Come awa’ from th’ bed!’  He was sitting on the side of it, with his face hidden in his
      hands.  ‘Come awa! from ’t.  ’Tis mine, and I’ve a right to t’!’</p>
     <p>As she staggered to it, he avoided her with a shudder, and passed — his face still hidden —
      to the opposite end of the room.  She threw herself upon the bed heavily, and soon was snoring
      hard.  He sunk into a chair, and moved but once all that night.  It was to throw a covering
      over her; as if his hands were not enough to hide her, even in the darkness.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XI NO WAY OUT</head>
     <p>The Fairy palaces burst into illumination, before pale morning showed the monstrous
      serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.  A clattering of clogs upon the pavement;
      a rapid ringing of bells; and all the melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the
      day’s monotony, were at their heavy exercise again.</p>
     <p>Stephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.  A special contrast, as every man
      was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked, to the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of
      mechanism at which he laboured.  Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art
      will consign Nature to oblivion.  Set anywhere, side by side, the work of <hi>God</hi> and the
      work of man; and the former, even though it be a troop of Hands of very small account, will
      gain in dignity from the comparison.</p>
     <p>So many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hundred horse Steam Power.  It is known, to the
      force of a single pound weight, what the engine will do; but, not all the calculators of the
      National Debt can tell me the capacity for good or evil, for love or hatred, for patriotism or
      discontent, for the decomposition of virtue into vice, or the reverse, at any single moment in
      the soul of one of these its quiet servants, with the composed faces and the regulated
      actions.  There is no mystery in it; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them,
      for ever. — Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects, and to govern
      these awful unknown quantities by other means!</p>
     <p>The day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against the flaming lights within.  The
      lights were turned out, and the work went on.  The rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents,
      submissive to the curse of all that tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth.  In the
      waste-yard outside, the steam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the
      shining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain.</p>
     <p>The work went on, until the noon-bell rang.  More clattering upon the pavements.  The looms,
      and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour.</p>
     <p>Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn. 
      He turned from his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he
      walked along, towards the hill on which his principal employer lived, in a red house with
      black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps,
       <hi>Bounderby</hi> (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen
      door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch.  So Stephen had expected.  Would his servant say that one of
      the Hands begged leave to speak to him?  Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. 
      Stephen Blackpool.  There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might
      come in.</p>
     <p>Stephen Blackpool in the parlour.  Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on
      chop and sherry.  Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one
      foot in a cotton stirrup.  It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit’s dignity and service, not
      to lunch.  She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own stately person she
      considered lunch a weakness.</p>
     <p>‘Now, Stephen,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘what’s the matter with <hi>you</hi>?’</p>
     <p>Stephen made a bow.  Not a servile one — these Hands will never do that!  Lord bless you,
      sir, you’ll never catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty years! — and, as a
      complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit, tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.</p>
     <p>‘Now, you know,’ said Mr. Bounderby, taking some sherry, ‘we have never had any difficulty
      with you, and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones.  You don’t expect to be set up
      in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good
      many of ’em do!’  Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole, immediate, and direct
      object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied; ‘and therefore I know already that you have
      not come here to make a complaint.  Now, you know, I am certain of that, beforehand.’</p>
     <p>‘No, sir, sure I ha’ not coom for nowt o’ th’ kind.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his previous strong conviction. 
      ‘Very well,’ he returned.  ‘You’re a steady Hand, and I was not mistaken.  Now, let me hear
      what it’s all about.  As it’s not that, let me hear what it is.  What have you got to say? 
      Out with it, lad!’</p>
     <p>Stephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘I can go, Mr. Bounderby, if you wish it,’
      said that self-sacrificing lady, making a feint of taking her foot out of the stirrup.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it,
      and putting out his left hand.  Then, withdrawing his hand and swallowing his mouthful of
      chop, he said to Stephen:</p>
     <p>‘Now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high lady.  You are not to suppose because
      she keeps my house for me, that she hasn’t been very high up the tree — ah, up at the top of
      the tree!  Now, if you have got anything to say that can’t be said before a born lady, this
      lady will leave the room.  If what you have got to say <hi>can</hi> be said before a born
      lady, this lady will stay where she is.’</p>
     <p>‘Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a born lady to year, sin’ I were born
      mysen’,’ was the reply, accompanied with a slight flush.</p>
     <p>‘Very well,’ said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his plate, and leaning back.  ‘Fire away!’</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ coom,’ Stephen began, raising his eyes from the floor, after a moment’s
      consideration, ‘to ask yo yor advice.  I need ’t overmuch.  I were married on Eas’r Monday
      nineteen year sin, long and dree.  She were a young lass — pretty enow — wi’ good accounts of
      herseln.  Well!  She went bad — soon.  Not along of me.  Gonnows I were not a unkind husband
      to her.’</p>
     <p>‘I have heard all this before,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘She took to drinking, left off
      working, sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, and played old Gooseberry.’</p>
     <p>‘I were patient wi’ her.’</p>
     <p>(‘The more fool you, I think,’ said Mr. Bounderby, in confidence to his wine-glass.)</p>
     <p>‘I were very patient wi’ her.  I tried to wean her fra ’t ower and ower agen.  I tried this,
      I tried that, I tried t’other.  I ha’ gone home, many’s the time, and found all vanished as I
      had in the world, and her without a sense left to bless herseln lying on bare ground.  I ha’
      dun ’t not once, not twice — twenty time!’</p>
     <p>Every line in his face deepened as he said it, and put in its affecting evidence of the
      suffering he had undergone.</p>
     <p>‘From bad to worse, from worse to worsen.  She left me.  She disgraced herseln everyways,
      bitter and bad.  She coom back, she coom back, she coom back.  What could I do t’ hinder her? 
      I ha’ walked the streets nights long, ere ever I’d go home.  I ha’ gone t’ th’ brigg, minded
      to fling myseln ower, and ha’ no more on’t.  I ha’ bore that much, that I were owd when I were
      young.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-needles, raised the Coriolanian eyebrows
      and shook her head, as much as to say, ‘The great know trouble as well as the small.  Please
      to turn your humble eye in My direction.’</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ paid her to keep awa’ fra’ me.  These five year I ha’ paid her.  I ha’ gotten decent
      fewtrils about me agen.  I ha’ lived hard and sad, but not ashamed and fearfo’ a’ the minnits
      o’ my life.  Last night, I went home.  There she lay upon my har-stone!  There she is!’</p>
     <p>In the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of his distress, he fired for the moment
      like a proud man.  In another moment, he stood as he had stood all the time — his usual stoop
      upon him; his pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half
      shrewd, half perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult; his
      hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip; his right arm, with a rugged
      propriety and force of action, very earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it
      always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused.</p>
     <p>‘I was acquainted with all this, you know,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘except the last clause,
      long ago.  It’s a bad job; that’s what it is.  You had better have been satisfied as you were,
      and not have got married.  However, it’s too late to say that.’</p>
     <p>‘Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘You hear what this lady asks.  Was it an unequal marriage in point of years, this unlucky
      job of yours?’ said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Not e’en so.  I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed, sir?’ said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity.  ‘I inferred, from its
      being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in point of years.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd
      sheepishness about it.  He fortified himself with a little more sherry.</p>
     <p>‘Well?  Why don’t you go on?’ he then asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen
      Blackpool.</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o’ this woman.’  Stephen infused a yet
      deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his attentive face.  Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle
      ejaculation, as having received a moral shock.</p>
     <p>‘What do you mean?’ said Bounderby, getting up to lean his back against the chimney-piece. 
      ‘What are you talking about?  You took her for better for worse.’</p>
     <p>‘I mun’ be ridden o’ her.  I cannot bear ’t nommore.  I ha’ lived under ’t so long, for that
      I ha’ had’n the pity and comforting words o’ th’ best lass living or dead.  Haply, but for
      her, I should ha’ gone battering mad.’</p>
     <p>‘He wishes to be free, to marry the female of whom he speaks, I fear, sir,’ observed Mrs.
      Sparsit in an undertone, and much dejected by the immorality of the people.</p>
     <p>‘I do.  The lady says what’s right.  I do.  I were a coming to ’t.  I ha’ read i’ th’ papers
      that great folk (fair faw ’em a’!  I wishes ’em no hurt!) are not bonded together for better
      for worst so fast, but that they can be set free fro’ <hi>their</hi> misfortnet marriages, an’
      marry ower agen.  When they dunnot agree, for that their tempers is ill-sorted, they has rooms
      o’ one kind an’ another in their houses, above a bit, and they can live asunders.  We fok ha’
      only one room, and we can’t.  When that won’t do, they ha’ gowd an’ other cash, an’ they can
      say “This for yo’ an’ that for me,” an’ they can go their separate ways.  We can’t.  Spite o’
      all that, they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine.  So, I mun be ridden o’ this
      woman, and I want t’ know how?’</p>
     <p>‘No how,’ returned Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘If I do her any hurt, sir, there’s a law to punish me?’</p>
     <p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
     <p>‘If I flee from her, there’s a law to punish me?’</p>
     <p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
     <p>‘If I marry t’oother dear lass, there’s a law to punish me?’</p>
     <p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
     <p>‘If I was to live wi’ her an’ not marry her — saying such a thing could be, which it never
      could or would, an’ her so good — there’s a law to punish me, in every innocent child
      belonging to me?’</p>
     <p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
     <p>‘Now, a’ God’s name,’ said Stephen Blackpool, ‘show me the law to help me!’</p>
     <p>‘Hem!  There’s a sanctity in this relation of life,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘and — and — it
      must be kept up.’</p>
     <p>‘No no, dunnot say that, sir.  ’Tan’t kep’ up that way.  Not that way.  ’Tis kep’ down that
      way.  I’m a weaver, I were in a fact’ry when a chilt, but I ha’ gotten een to see wi’ and eern
      to year wi’.  I read in th’ papers every ’Sizes, every Sessions — and you read too — I know
      it! — with dismay — how th’ supposed unpossibility o’ ever getting unchained from one another,
      at any price, on any terms, brings blood upon this land, and brings many common married fok to
      battle, murder, and sudden death.  Let us ha’ this, right understood.  Mine’s a grievous case,
      an’ I want — if yo will be so good — t’ know the law that helps me.’</p>
     <p>‘Now, I tell you what!’ said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his pockets.  ‘There
       <hi>is</hi> such a law.’</p>
     <p>Stephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering in his attention, gave a
      nod.</p>
     <p>‘But it’s not for you at all.  It costs money.  It costs a mint of money.’</p>
     <p>‘How much might that be?’ Stephen calmly asked.</p>
     <p>‘Why, you’d have to go to Doctors’ Commons with a suit, and you’d have to go to a court of
      Common Law with a suit, and you’d have to go to the House of Lords with a suit, and you’d have
      to get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a
      case of very plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound,’ said Mr.
      Bounderby.  ‘Perhaps twice the money.’</p>
     <p>‘There’s no other law?’</p>
     <p>‘Certainly not.’</p>
     <p>‘Why then, sir,’ said Stephen, turning white, and motioning with that right hand of his, as
      if he gave everything to the four winds, ‘’<hi>tis</hi> a muddle.  ’Tis just a muddle
      a’toogether, an’ the sooner I am dead, the better.’</p>
     <p>(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.)</p>
     <p>‘Pooh, pooh!  Don’t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘about things
      you don’t understand; and don’t you call the Institutions of your country a muddle, or you’ll
      get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings.  The institutions of your country
      are not your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind your piece-work. 
      You didn’t take your wife
      <pb n=" 59"/>for fast and for loose; but for better for worse.  If she has turned out worse —
      why, all we have got to say is, she might have turned out better.’</p>
     <p>‘’Tis a muddle,’ said Stephen, shaking his head as he moved to the door.  ‘’Tis a’ a
      muddle!’</p>
     <p>‘Now, I’ll tell you what!’ Mr. Bounderby resumed, as a valedictory address.  ‘With what I
      shall call your unhallowed opinions, you have been quite shocking this lady: who, as I have
      already told you, is a born lady, and who, as I have not already told you, has had her own
      marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds — tens of Thousands of
      Pounds!’ (he repeated it with great relish).  ‘Now, you have always been a steady Hand
      hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you plainly, that you are turning into the wrong
      road.  You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other — they’re always about —
      and the best thing you can do is, to come out of that.  Now you know;’ here his countenance
      expressed marvellous acuteness; ‘I can see as far into a grindstone as another man; farther
      than a good many, perhaps, because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young.  I see
      traces of the turtle soup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.  Yes, I do!’ cried Mr.
      Bounderby, shaking his head with obstinate cunning.  ‘By the Lord Harry, I do!’</p>
     <p>With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said, ‘Thank you, sir, I wish
      you good day.’  So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall, as if he
      were going to explode himself into it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her
      stirrup, looking quite cast down by the popular vices.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XII THE OLD WOMAN</head>
     <p>Old Stephen descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with the brazen
      door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he gave a parting polish with the
      sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot hand clouded it.  He crossed the street with his
      eyes bent upon the ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a touch upon
      his arm.</p>
     <p>It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment — the touch that could calm the wild
      waters of his soul, as the uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience could abate the
      raging of the sea — yet it was a woman’s hand too.  It was an old woman, tall and shapely
      still, though withered by time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned.  She was
      very cleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and was newly come from a
      journey.  The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted noise of the streets; the spare shawl,
      carried unfolded on her arm; the heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered
      gloves, to which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country, in her
      plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence.  Remarking this
      at a glance, with the quick observation of his class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive
      face — his face, which, like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes
      and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the concentrated look with which we
      are familiar in the countenances of the deaf — the better to hear what she asked him.</p>
     <p>‘Pray, sir,’ said the old woman, ‘didn’t I see you come out of that gentleman’s house?’
      pointing back to Mr. Bounderby’s.  ‘I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to
      mistake the person in following?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, missus,’ returned Stephen, ‘it were me.’</p>
     <p>‘Have you — you’ll excuse an old woman’s curiosity — have you seen the gentleman?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, missus.’</p>
     <p>‘And how did he look, sir?  Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?’  As she
      straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to her words, the
      idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before, and had not quite liked her.</p>
     <p>‘O yes,’ he returned, observing her more attentively, ‘he were all that.’</p>
     <p>‘And healthy,’ said the old woman, ‘as the fresh wind?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes,’ returned Stephen.  ‘He were ett’n and drinking — as large and as loud as a
      Hummobee.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you!’ said the old woman, with infinite content.  ‘Thank you!’</p>
     <p>He certainly never had seen this old woman before.  Yet there was a vague remembrance in his
      mind, as if he had more than once dreamed of some old woman like her.</p>
     <p>She walked along at his side, and, gently accommodating himself to her humour, he said
      Coketown was a busy place, was it not?  To which she answered ‘Eigh sure!  Dreadful busy!’ 
      Then he said, she came from the country, he saw?  To which she answered in the
      affirmative.</p>
     <p>‘By Parliamentary, this morning.  I came forty mile by Parliamentary this morning, and I’m
      going back the same forty mile this afternoon.  I walked nine mile to the station this
      morning, and if I find nobody on the road to give me a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back
      to-night.  That’s pretty well, sir, at my age!’ said the chatty old woman, her eye brightening
      with exultation.</p>
     <p>‘’Deed ’tis.  Don’t do’t too often, missus.’</p>
     <p>‘No, no.  Once a year,’ she answered, shaking her head.  ‘I spend my savings so, once every
      year.  I come regular, to tramp about the streets, and see the gentlemen.’</p>
     <p>‘Only to see ’em?’ returned Stephen.</p>
     <p>‘That’s enough for me,’ she replied, with great earnestness and interest of manner.  ‘I ask
      no more!  I have been standing about, on this side of the way, to see that gentleman,’ turning
      her head back towards Mr. Bounderby’s again, ‘come out.  But, he’s late this year, and I have
      not seen him.  You came out instead.  Now, if I am obliged to go back without a glimpse of him
      — I only want a glimpse — well!  I have seen you, and you have seen him, and I must make that
      do.’  Saying this, she looked at Stephen as if to fix his features in her mind, and her eye
      was not so bright as it had been.</p>
     <p>With a large allowance for difference of tastes, and with all submission to the patricians
      of Coketown, this seemed so extraordinary a source of interest to take so much trouble about,
      that it perplexed him.  But they were passing the church now, and as his eye caught the clock,
      he quickened his pace.</p>
     <p>He was going to his work? the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite easily.  Yes, time
      was nearly out.  On his telling her where he worked, the old woman became a more singular old
      woman than before.</p>
     <p>‘An’t you happy?’ she asked him.</p>
     <p>‘Why — there’s awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.’  He answered evasively,
      because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he would be very happy indeed, and
      he had not the heart to disappoint her.  He knew that there was trouble enough in the world;
      and if the old woman had lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much
      the better for her, and none the worse for him.</p>
     <p>‘Ay, ay!  You have your troubles at home, you mean?’ she said.</p>
     <p>‘Times.  Just now and then,’ he answered, slightly.</p>
     <p>‘But, working under such a gentleman, they don’t follow you to the Factory?’</p>
     <p>No, no; they didn’t follow him there, said Stephen.  All correct there.  Everything
      accordant there.  (He did not go so far as to say, for her pleasure, that there was a sort of
      Divine Right there; but, I have heard claims almost as magnificent of late years.)</p>
     <p>They were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were crowding in.  The bell
      was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the Elephant was getting ready. 
      The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell.  It was the beautifullest bell she had
      ever heard, she said, and sounded grand!</p>
     <p>She asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her before going in, how
      long he had worked there?</p>
     <p>‘A dozen year,’ he told her.</p>
     <p>‘I must kiss the hand,’ said she, ‘that has worked in this fine factory for a dozen year!’ 
      And she lifted it, though he would have prevented her, and put it to her lips.  What harmony,
      besides her age and her simplicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this
      fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something which it
      seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done with such a natural and touching
      air.</p>
     <p>He had been at his loom full half an hour, thinking about this old woman, when, having
      occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he glanced through a window which was in
      his corner, and saw her still looking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration. 
      Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of her two long journeys, she was gazing at it, as
      if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her.</p>
     <p>She was gone by and by, and the day went after her, and the lights sprung up again, and the
      Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches near: little felt amid the
      jarring of the machinery, and scarcely heard above its crash and rattle.  Long before then his
      thoughts had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the shameful figure
      heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart.</p>
     <p>Machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped.  The bell again; the
      glare of light and heat dispelled; the factories, looming heavy in the black wet night — their
      tall chimneys rising up into the air like competing Towers of Babel.</p>
     <p>He had spoken to Rachael only last night, it was true, and had walked with her a little way;
      but he had his new misfortune on him, in which no one else could give him a moment’s relief,
      and, for the sake of it, and because he knew himself to want that softening of his anger which
      no voice but hers could effect, he felt he might so far disregard what she had said as to wait
      for her again.  He waited, but she had eluded him.  She was gone.  On no other night in the
      year could he so ill have spared her patient face.</p>
     <p>O!  Better to have no home in which to lay his head, than to have a home and dread to go to
      it, through such a cause.  He ate and drank, for he was exhausted — but he little knew or
      cared what; and he wandered about in the chill rain, thinking and thinking, and brooding and
      brooding.</p>
     <p>No word of a new marriage had ever passed between them; but Rachael had taken great pity on
      him years ago, and to her alone he had opened his closed heart all this time, on the subject
      of his
      <pb n=" 63"/>miseries; and he knew very well that if he were free to ask her, she would take
      him.  He thought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with pleasure and
      pride; of the different man he might have been that night; of the lightness then in his now
      heavy-laden breast; of the then restored honour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to
      pieces.  He thought of the waste of the best part of his life, of the change it made in his
      character for the worse every day, of the dreadful nature of his existence, bound hand and
      foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon in her shape.  He thought of Rachael, how
      young when they were first brought together in these circumstances, how mature now, how soon
      to grow old.  He thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry, how many homes
      with children in them she had seen grow up around her, how she had contentedly pursued her own
      lone quiet path — for him — and how he had sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed
      face, that smote him with remorse and despair.  He set the picture of her up, beside the
      infamous image of last night; and thought, Could it be, that the whole earthly course of one
      so gentle, good, and self-denying, was subjugate to such a wretch as that!</p>
     <p>Filled with these thoughts — so filled that he had an unwholesome sense of growing larger,
      of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards the objects among which he passed,
      of seeing the iris round every misty light turn red — he went home for shelter.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XIII RACHAEL</head>
     <p>A <hi>candle</hi> faintly burned in the window, to which the black ladder had often been
      raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in this world to a striving wife and
      a brood of hungry babies; and Stephen added to his other thoughts the stern reflection, that
      of all the casualties of this existence upon earth, not one was dealt out with so unequal a
      hand as Death.  The inequality of Birth was nothing to it.  For, say that the child of a King
      and the child of a Weaver were born to-night in the same moment, what was that disparity, to
      the death of any human creature who was serviceable to, or beloved by, another, while this
      abandoned woman lived on!</p>
     <p>From the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside, with suspended breath and
      with a slow footstep.  He went up to his door, opened it, and so into the room.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 64"/>Quiet and peace were there.  Rachael was there, sitting by the bed.</p>
     <p>She turned her head, and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight of his mind.  She
      sat by the bed, watching and tending his wife.  That is to say, he saw that some one lay
      there, and he knew too well it must be she; but Rachael’s hands had put a curtain up, so that
      she was screened from his eyes.  Her disgraceful garments were removed, and some of Rachael’s
      were in the room.  Everything was in its place and order as he had always kept it, the little
      fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was freshly swept.  It appeared to him that he saw all
      this in Rachael’s face, and looked at nothing besides.  While looking at it, it was shut out
      from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes; but not before he had seen how
      earnestly she looked at him, and how her own eyes were filled too.</p>
     <p>She turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was quiet there, spoke in
      a low, calm, cheerful voice.</p>
     <p>‘I am glad you have come at last, Stephen.  You are very late.’</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ been walking up an’ down.’</p>
     <p>‘I thought so.  But ’tis too bad a night for that.  The rain falls very heavy, and the wind
      has risen.’</p>
     <p>The wind?  True.  It was blowing hard.  Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the
      surging noise!  To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing!</p>
     <p>‘I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen.  Landlady came round for me at dinner-time. 
      There was some one here that needed looking to, she said.  And ‘deed she was right.  All
      wandering and lost, Stephen.  Wounded too, and bruised.’</p>
     <p>He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her.</p>
     <p>‘I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked with me when we were
      girls both, and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend — ’</p>
     <p>He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan.</p>
     <p>‘And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that ’tis far too
      merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want of aid.  Thou knowest who said,
      “Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her!”  There have been plenty to
      do that.  Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so
      low.’</p>
     <p>‘O Rachael, Rachael!’</p>
     <p>‘Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!’ she said, in compassionate accents. 
      ‘I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and mind.’</p>
     <p/>
     <p>The wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast. 
      She dressed them now, still without showing her.  She steeped a piece of linen in a basin,
      into which she poured some liquid from a bottle, and laid it with a gentle hand upon the
      sore.  The three-legged table had been drawn close to the bedside, and on it there were two
      bottles.  This was one.</p>
     <p>It was not so far off, but that Stephen, following her hands with his eyes, could read what
      was printed on it in large letters.  He turned of a deadly hue, and a sudden horror seemed to
      fall upon him.</p>
     <p>‘I will stay here, Stephen,’ said Rachael, quietly resuming her seat, ‘till the bells go
      Three.  ’Tis to be done again at three, and then she may be left till morning.’</p>
     <p>‘But thy rest agen to-morrow’s work, my dear.’</p>
     <p>‘I slept sound last night.  I can wake many nights, when I am put to it.  ’Tis thou who art
      in need of rest — so white and tired.  Try to sleep in the chair there, while I watch.  Thou
      hadst no sleep last night, I can well believe.  To-morrow’s work is far harder for thee than
      for me.’</p>
     <p>He heard the thundering and surging out of doors, and it seemed to him as if his late angry
      mood were going about trying to get at him.  She had cast it out; she would keep it out; he
      trusted to her to defend him from himself.</p>
     <p>‘She don’t know me, Stephen; she just drowsily mutters and stares.  I have spoken to her
      times and again, but she don’t notice!  ’Tis as well so.  When she comes to her right mind
      once more, I shall have done what I can, and she never the wiser.’</p>
     <p>‘How long, Rachael, is ’t looked for, that she’ll be so?’</p>
     <p>‘Doctor said she would haply come to her mind to-morrow.’</p>
     <p>His eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over him, causing him to shiver in
      every limb.  She thought he was chilled with the wet.  ‘No,’ he said, ‘it was not that.  He
      had had a fright.’</p>
     <p>‘A fright?’</p>
     <p>‘Ay, ay! coming in.  When I were walking.  When I were thinking.  When I — ’  It seized him
      again; and he stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf, as he pressed his dank cold hair down
      with a hand that shook as if it were palsied.</p>
     <p>‘Stephen!’</p>
     <p>She was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm to stop her.</p>
     <p>‘No!  Don’t, please; don’t.  Let me see thee setten by the bed.  Let me see thee, a’ so
      good, and so forgiving.  Let me see thee as I see thee when I coom in.  I can never see thee
      better than so.  Never, never, never!’</p>
     <p>He had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into his chair.  After a time he controlled
      himself, and, resting with an elbow on one knee, and his head upon that hand, could look
      towards Rachael.  Seen across the dim candle with his moistened eyes, she looked as if she had
      a glory shining round her head.  He could have believed she had.  He did believe it, as the
      noise without shook the window, rattled at the door below, and went about the house clamouring
      and lamenting.</p>
     <p>‘When she gets better, Stephen, ’tis to be hoped she’ll leave thee to thyself again, and do
      thee no more hurt.  Anyways we will hope so now.  And now I shall keep silence, for I want
      thee to sleep.’</p>
     <p>He closed his eyes, more to please her than to rest his weary head; but, by slow degrees as
      he listened to the great noise of the wind, he ceased to hear it, or it changed into the
      working of his loom, or even into the voices of the day (his own included) saying what had
      been really said.  Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a
      long, troubled dream.</p>
     <p>He thought that he, and some one on whom his heart had long been set — but she was not
      Rachael, and that surprised him, even in the midst of his imaginary happiness — stood in the
      church being married.  While the ceremony was performing, and while he recognized among the
      witnesses some whom he knew to be living, and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness came on,
      succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.  It broke from one line in the table of
      commandments at the altar, and illuminated the building with the words.  They were sounded
      through the church, too, as if there were voices in the fiery letters.  Upon this, the whole
      appearance before him and around him changed, and nothing was left as it had been, but himself
      and the clergyman.  They stood in the daylight before a crowd so vast, that if all the people
      in the world could have been brought together into one space, they could not have looked, he
      thought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him, and there was not one pitying or friendly
      eye among the millions that were fastened on his face.  He stood on a raised stage, under his
      own loom; and, looking up at the shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service
      distinctly read, he knew that he was there to suffer death.  In an instant what he stood on
      fell below him, and he was gone.</p>
     <p> — Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life, and to places that he knew, he was
      unable to consider; but he was back in those places by some means, and with this condemnation
      upon him, that he was never, in this world or the next, through all the unimaginable ages of
      eternity, to look on Rachael’s face or hear her voice.  Wandering to and fro, unceasingly,
      without hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only knew that he was doomed to seek it),
      he was the subject of a nameless, horrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which
      everything took.  Whatsoever he looked at, grew into that form sooner or later.  The object of
      his miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any one among the various people he
      encountered.  Hopeless labour!  If he led them out of rooms where it was, if he shut up
      drawers and closets where it stood, if he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be
      secreted, and got them out into the streets, the very chimneys of the mills assumed that
      shape, and round them was the printed word.</p>
     <p>The wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on the house-tops, and the larger spaces
      through which he had strayed contracted to the four walls of his room.  Saving that the fire
      had died out, it was as his eyes had closed upon it.  Rachael seemed to have fallen into a
      doze, in the chair by the bed.  She sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still.  The table
      stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its real proportions and
      appearance, was the shape so often repeated.</p>
     <p>He thought he saw the curtain move.  He looked again, and he was sure it moved.  He saw a
      hand come forth and grope about a little.  Then the curtain moved more perceptibly, and the
      woman in the bed put it back, and sat up.</p>
     <p>With her woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy and large, she looked all round the room,
      and passed the corner where he slept in his chair.  Her eyes returned to that corner, and she
      put her hand over them as a shade, while she looked into it.  Again they went all round the
      room, scarcely heeding Rachael if at all, and returned to that corner.  He thought, as she
      once more shaded them — not so much looking at him, as looking for him with a brutish instinct
      that he was there — that no single trace was left in those debauched features, or in the mind
      that went along with them, of the woman he had married eighteen years before.  But that he had
      seen her come to this by inches, he never could have believed her to be the same.</p>
     <p>All this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motionless and powerless, except to watch
      her.</p>
     <p>Stupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable self about nothing, she sat for a little
      while with her hands at her ears, and her head resting on them.  Presently, she resumed her
      staring round the room.  And now, for the first time, her eyes stopped at the table with the
      bottles on it.</p>
     <p>Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner, with the defiance of last night, and
      moving very cautiously and softly, stretched out her greedy hand.  She drew a mug into the
      bed, and sat for a while considering which of the two bottles she should choose.  Finally, she
      laid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death in it, and, before
      his eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.</p>
     <p>Dream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power to stir.  If this be real, and her
      allotted time be not yet come, wake, Rachael, wake!</p>
     <p>She thought of that, too.  She looked at Rachael, and very slowly, very cautiously, poured
      out the contents.  The draught was at her lips.  A moment and she would be past all help, let
      the whole world wake and come about her with its utmost power.  But in that moment Rachael
      started up with a suppressed cry.  The creature struggled, struck her, seized her by the hair;
      but Rachael had the cup.</p>
     <p>Stephen broke out of his chair.  ‘Rachael, am I wakin’ or dreamin’ this dreadfo’ night?’</p>
     <p>‘’Tis all well, Stephen.  I have been asleep, myself.  ’Tis near three.  Hush!  I hear the
      bells.’</p>
     <p>The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window.  They listened, and it struck
      three.  Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder of her hair, and the
      red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing
      had been awake.  She held the cup in her hand even now.</p>
     <p>‘I thought it must be near three,’ she said, calmly pouring from the cup into the basin, and
      steeping the linen as before.  ‘I am thankful I stayed!  ’Tis done now, when I have put this
      on.  There!  And now she’s quiet again.  The few drops in the basin I’ll pour away, for ’tis
      bad stuff to leave about, though ever so little of it.’  As she spoke, she drained the basin
      into the ashes of the fire, and broke the bottle on the hearth.</p>
     <p>She had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her shawl before going out into the
      wind and rain.</p>
     <p>‘Thou’lt let me walk wi’ thee at this hour, Rachael?’</p>
     <p>‘No, Stephen.  ’Tis but a minute, and I’m home.’</p>
     <p>‘Thou’rt not fearfo’;’ he said it in a low voice, as they went out at the door; ‘to leave me
      alone wi’ her!’</p>
     <p>As she looked at him, saying, ‘Stephen?’ he went down on his knee before her, on the poor
      mean stairs, and put an end of her shawl to his lips.</p>
     <p>‘Thou art an Angel.  Bless thee, bless thee!’</p>
     <p>‘I am, as I have told thee, Stephen, thy poor friend.  Angels are not like me.  Between
      them, and a working woman fu’ of faults, there is a deep gulf set.  My little sister is among
      them, but she is changed.’</p>
     <p>She raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words; and then they fell again, in all
      their gentleness and mildness, on his face.</p>
     <p>‘Thou changest me from bad to good.  Thou mak’st me humbly wishfo’ to be more like thee, and
      fearfo’ to lose thee when this life is ower, and a’ the muddle cleared awa’.  Thou’rt an
      Angel; it may be, thou hast saved my soul alive!’</p>
     <p>She looked at him, on his knee at her feet, with her shawl still in
      <pb n=" 69"/>his hand, and the reproof on her lips died away when she saw the working of his
      face.</p>
     <p>‘I coom home desp’rate.  I coom home wi’out a hope, and mad wi’ thinking that when I said a
      word o’ complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable Hand.  I told thee I had had a fright.  It
      were the Poison-bottle on table.  I never hurt a livin’ creetur; but happenin’ so suddenly
      upon ’t, I thowt, “How can <hi>I</hi> say what I might ha’ done to myseln, or her, or
      both!”’</p>
     <p>She put her two hands on his mouth, with a face of terror, to stop him from saying more.  He
      caught them in his unoccupied hand, and holding them, and still clasping the border of her
      shawl, said hurriedly:</p>
     <p>‘But I see thee, Rachael, setten by the bed.  I ha’ seen thee, aw this night.  In my
      troublous sleep I ha’ known thee still to be there.  Evermore I will see thee there.  I
      nevermore will see her or think o’ her, but thou shalt be beside her.  I nevermore will see or
      think o’ anything that angers me, but thou, so much better than me, shalt be by th’ side
      on’t.  And so I will try t’ look t’ th’ time, and so I will try t’ trust t’ th’ time, when
      thou and me at last shall walk together far awa’, beyond the deep gulf, in th’ country where
      thy little sister is.’</p>
     <p>He kissed the border of her shawl again, and let her go.  She bade him good night in a
      broken voice, and went out into the street.</p>
     <p>The wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear, and still blew strongly.  It
      had cleared the sky before it, and the rain had spent itself or travelled elsewhere, and the
      stars were bright.  He stood bare-headed in the road, watching her quick disappearance.  As
      the shining stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was Rachael, in the rugged fancy
      of this man, to the common experiences of his life.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XIV THE GREAT MANUFACTURER</head>
     <p>Time went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought up, so
      much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.  But, less inexorable than
      iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and
      brick, and made the only stand that ever <hi>was</hi> made in the place against its direful
      uniformity.</p>
     <p>‘Louisa is becoming,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘almost a young woman.’</p>
     <p>Time, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what anybody said, and
      presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than when his father had last taken particular
      notice of him.</p>
     <p>‘Thomas is becoming,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘almost a young man.’</p>
     <p>Time passed Thomas on in the mill, while his father was thinking about it, and there he
      stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar.</p>
     <p>‘Really,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to
      Bounderby.’</p>
     <p>Time, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby’s Bank, made him an inmate of
      Bounderby’s house, necessitated the purchase of his first razor, and exercised him diligently
      in his calculations relative to number one.</p>
     <p>The same great manufacturer, always with an immense variety of work on hand, in every stage
      of development, passed Sissy onward in his mill, and worked her up into a very pretty article
      indeed.</p>
     <p>‘I fear, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that your continuance at the school any longer would be
      useless.’</p>
     <p>‘I am afraid it would, sir,’ Sissy answered with a curtsey.</p>
     <p>‘I cannot disguise from you, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, knitting his brow, ‘that the result
      of your probation there has disappointed me; has greatly disappointed me.  You have not
      acquired, under Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge
      which I looked for.  You are extremely deficient in your facts.  Your acquaintance with
      figures is very limited.  You are altogether backward, and below the mark.’</p>
     <p>‘I am sorry, sir,’ she returned; ‘but I know it is quite true.  Yet I have tried hard,
      sir.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘yes, I believe you have tried hard; I have observed you, and I
      can find no fault in that respect.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, sir.  I have thought sometimes;’ Sissy very timid here; ‘that perhaps I tried to
      learn too much, and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less, I might have —
      ’</p>
     <p>‘No, Jupe, no,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his head in his profoundest and most eminently
      practical way.  ‘No.  The course you pursued, you pursued according to the system — the system
      — and there is no more to be said about it.  I can only suppose that the circumstances of your
      early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers, and that we
      began too late.  Still, as I have said already, I am disappointed.’</p>
     <p>‘I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment, sir, of your kindness to a poor forlorn
      girl who had no claim upon you, and of your protection of her.’</p>
     <p>‘Don’t shed tears,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Don’t shed tears.  I don’t complain of you.  You
      are an affectionate, earnest, good young woman — and — and we must make that do.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, sir, very much,’ said Sissy, with a grateful curtsey.</p>
     <p>‘You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you are serviceable in
      the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have observed myself.  I
      therefore hope,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that you can make yourself happy in those
      relations.’</p>
     <p>‘I should have nothing to wish, sir, if — ’</p>
     <p>‘I understand you,’ said Mr. Gradgrind; ‘you still refer to your father.  I have heard from
      Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle.  Well!  If your training in the science of
      arriving at exact results had been more successful, you would have been wiser on these
      points.  I will say no more.’</p>
     <p>He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he held her calculating
      powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion.  Somehow
      or other, he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could
      hardly be set forth in a tabular form.  Her capacity of definition might be easily stated at a
      very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at nothing; yet he was not sure that if he had
      been required, for example, to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return, he would
      have quite known how to divide her.</p>
     <p>In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of Time are very
      rapid.  Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their working up, these changes
      were effected in a year or two; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course,
      and underwent no alteration.</p>
     <p>Except one, which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill.  Time hustled him
      into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a by-comer, and made him Member of
      Parliament for Coketown: one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures, one of
      the representatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable gentlemen, dumb
      honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame honourable gentlemen, dead honourable
      gentlemen, to every other consideration.  Else wherefore live we in a Christian land, eighteen
      hundred and odd years after our Master?</p>
     <p>All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so much given to
      watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate, and became extinct, that
      from the period when her father had said she was almost a young woman — which seemed but
      yesterday — she had scarcely attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young
      woman.</p>
     <p>‘Quite a young woman,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, musing.  ‘Dear me!’</p>
     <p>Soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for several days, and seemed
      much engrossed by one subject.  On a certain night, when he was going out, and Louisa came to
      bid him good-bye before his departure — as he was not to be home until late and she would not
      see him again until the morning — he held her in his arms, looking at her in his kindest
      manner, and said:</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa, you are a woman!’</p>
     <p>She answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she was found at the
      Circus; then cast down her eyes.  ‘Yes, father.’</p>
     <p>‘My dear,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘I must speak with you alone and seriously.  Come to me in my
      room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, father.’</p>
     <p>‘Your hands are rather cold, Louisa.  Are you not well?’</p>
     <p>‘Quite well, father.’</p>
     <p>‘And cheerful?’</p>
     <p>She looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar manner.  ‘I am as cheerful, father, as I
      usually am, or usually have been.’</p>
     <p>‘That’s well,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  So, he kissed her and went away; and Louisa returned to
      the serene apartment of the hair-cutting character, and leaning her elbow on her hand, looked
      again at the short-lived sparks that so soon subsided into ashes.</p>
     <p>‘Are you there, Loo?’ said her brother, looking in at the door.  He was quite a young
      gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing one.</p>
     <p>‘Dear Tom,’ she answered, rising and embracing him, ‘how long it is since you have been to
      see me!’</p>
     <p>‘Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the evenings; and in the daytime old Bounderby
      has been keeping me at it rather.  But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong,
      and so we preserve an understanding.  I say!  Has father said anything particular to you
      to-day or yesterday, Loo?’</p>
     <p>‘No, Tom.  But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning.’</p>
     <p>‘Ah!  That’s what I mean,’ said Tom.  ‘Do you know where he is to-night?’ — with a very deep
      expression.</p>
     <p>‘No.’</p>
     <p>‘Then I’ll tell you.  He’s with old Bounderby.  They are having a regular confab together up
      at the Bank.  Why at the Bank, do you think?  Well, I’ll tell you again.  To keep Mrs.
      Sparsit’s ears as far off as possible, I expect.’</p>
     <p>With her hand upon her brother’s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire.  Her
      brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with
      his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 73"/>‘You are very fond of me, an’t you, Loo?’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see
      me.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, sister of mine,’ said Tom, ‘when you say that, you are near my thoughts.  We might be
      so much oftener together — mightn’t we?  Always together, almost — mightn’t we?  It would do
      me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what, Loo.  It would be a
      splendid thing for me.  It would be uncommonly jolly!’</p>
     <p>Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny.  He could make nothing of her face.  He
      pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek.  She returned the kiss, but still looked at the
      fire.</p>
     <p>‘I say, Loo!  I thought I’d come, and just hint to you what was going on: though I supposed
      you’d most likely guess, even if you didn’t know.  I can’t stay, because I’m engaged to some
      fellows to-night.  You won’t forget how fond you are of me?’</p>
     <p>‘No, dear Tom, I won’t forget.’</p>
     <p>‘That’s a capital girl,’ said Tom.  ‘Good-bye, Loo.’</p>
     <p>She gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him to the door, whence the fires
      of Coketown could be seen, making the distance lurid.  She stood there, looking steadfastly
      towards them, and listening to his departing steps.  They retreated quickly, as glad to get
      away from Stone Lodge; and she stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet.  It seemed
      as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the fiery haze without, she tried
      to discover what kind of woof Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all,
      would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman.  But his factory is a secret
      place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XV FATHER AND DAUGHTER</head>
     <p>Although Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard, his room was quite a blue
      chamber in its abundance of blue books.  Whatever they could prove (which is usually anything
      you like), they proved there, in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new
      recruits.  In that charmed apartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got
      into exact totals, and finally settled — if those concerned could only have been brought to
      know it.  As if an astronomical observatory should be made without any windows, and the
      astronomer within should arrange the starry universe solely by pen, ink, and paper, so Mr.
      Gradgrind, in <hi>his</hi> Observatory (and there are many like it), had no need to cast an
      eye upon the teeming myriads of human beings around him, but could settle all their destinies
      on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge.</p>
     <p>To this Observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly statistical clock in it, which
      measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin-lid; Louisa repaired on the
      appointed morning.  A window looked towards Coketown; and when she sat down near her father’s
      table, she saw the high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy distance
      gloomily.</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa,’ said her father, ‘I prepared you last night to give me your serious
      attention in the conversation we are now going to have together.  You have been so well
      trained, and you do, I am happy to say, so much justice to the education you have received,
      that I have perfect confidence in your good sense.  You are not impulsive, you are not
      romantic, you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason
      and calculation.  From that ground alone, I know you will view and consider what I am going to
      communicate.’</p>
     <p>He waited, as if he would have been glad that she said something.  But she said never a
      word.</p>
     <p>‘Louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to
      me.’</p>
     <p>Again he waited, and again she answered not one word.  This so far surprised him, as to
      induce him gently to repeat, ‘a proposal of marriage, my dear.’  To which she returned,
      without any visible emotion whatever:</p>
     <p>‘I hear you, father.  I am attending, I assure you.’</p>
     <p>‘Well!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the moment at a loss,
      ‘you are even more dispassionate than I expected, Louisa.  Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared
      for the announcement I have it in charge to make?’</p>
     <p>‘I cannot say that, father, until I hear it.  Prepared or unprepared, I wish to hear it all
      from you.  I wish to hear you state it to me, father.’</p>
     <p>Strange to relate, Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as his daughter was. 
      He took a paper-knife in his hand, turned it over, laid it down, took it up again, and even
      then had to look along the blade of it, considering how to go on.</p>
     <p>‘What you say, my dear Louisa, is perfectly reasonable.  I have undertaken then to let you
      know that — in short, that Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your
      progress with particular interest and pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might
      ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage.  That time, to which he has
      so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward, is now come.  Mr. Bounderby has
      made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to
      express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.’</p>
     <p>Silence between them.  The deadly statistical clock very hollow.  The distant smoke very
      black and heavy.</p>
     <p>‘Father,’ said Louisa, ‘do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question.  ‘Well, my child,’ he
      returned, ‘I — really — cannot take upon myself to say.’</p>
     <p>‘Father,’ pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, ‘do you ask me to love Mr.
      Bounderby?’</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa, no.  No.  I ask nothing.’</p>
     <p>‘Father,’ she still pursued, ‘does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?’</p>
     <p>‘Really, my dear,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘it is difficult to answer your question — ’</p>
     <p>‘Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father?</p>
     <p>‘Certainly, my dear.  Because;’ here was something to demonstrate, and it set him up again;
      ‘because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we use the
      expression.  Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself the
      injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using synonymous terms)
      sentimental.  Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes, to very little
      purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to
      address you from any such ground.  Therefore, perhaps the expression itself — I merely suggest
      this to you, my dear — may be a little misplaced.’</p>
     <p>‘What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, my dear Louisa,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, completely recovered by this time, ‘I would
      advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question, as you have been accustomed to
      consider every other question, simply as one of tangible Fact.  The ignorant and the giddy may
      embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no existence,
      properly viewed — really no existence — but it is no compliment to you to say, that you know
      better.  Now, what are the Facts of this case?  You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty
      years of age; Mr. Bounderby is, we will say in round numbers, fifty.  There is some disparity
      in your respective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the contrary,
      there is a great suitability.  Then the question arises, Is this one disparity sufficient to
      operate as a bar to such a marriage?  In considering this question, it is not unimportant to
      take into account the statistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in
      England and Wales.  I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion of these
      marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages, and that the elder of these
      contracting parties is, in rather more than three-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom. 
      It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the
      British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and among the Calmucks of
      Tartary, the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers, yield similar results. 
      The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all
      but disappears.’</p>
     <p>‘What do you recommend, father,’ asked Louisa, her reserved composure not in the least
      affected by these gratifying results, ‘that I should substitute for the term I used just now? 
      For the misplaced expression?’</p>
     <p>‘Louisa,’ returned her father, ‘it appears to me that nothing can be plainer.  Confining
      yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby
      ask me to marry him?  Yes, he does.  The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him? 
      I think nothing can be plainer than that?’</p>
     <p>‘Shall I marry him?’ repeated Louisa, with great deliberation.</p>
     <p>‘Precisely.  And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear Louisa, to know that you
      do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits
      of life, that belong to many young women.’</p>
     <p>‘No, father,’ she returned, ‘I do not.’</p>
     <p>‘I now leave you to judge for yourself,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘I have stated the case, as
      such cases are usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the case of your
      mother and myself was stated in its time.  The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to
      decide.’</p>
     <p>From the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly.  As he now leaned back in his chair,
      and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn, perhaps he might have seen one wavering
      moment in her, when she was impelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the
      pent-up confidences of her heart.  But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a bound the
      artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting, between himself and all those subtle
      essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet
      ever to be sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.  The barriers were too many and too high
      for such a leap.  With his unbending, utilitarian, matter-of-fact face, he hardened her again;
      and the moment shot away into the plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost
      opportunities that are drowned there.</p>
     <p>Removing her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently towards the town, that he said,
      at length: ‘Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works, Louisa?’</p>
     <p>‘There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.  Yet when the night
      comes, Fire bursts out, father!’ she answered, turning quickly.</p>
     <p>‘Of course I know that, Louisa.  I do not see the application of the remark.’  To do him
      justice he did not, at all.</p>
     <p>She passed it away with a slight motion of her hand, and concentrating her attention upon
      him again, said, ‘Father, I have often thought that life is very short.’ — This was so
      distinctly one of his subjects that he interposed.</p>
     <p>‘It is short, no doubt, my dear.  Still, the average duration of human life is proved to
      have increased of late years.  The calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices,
      among other figures which cannot go wrong, have established the fact.’</p>
     <p>‘I speak of my own life, father.’</p>
     <p>‘O indeed?  Still,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘I need not point out to you, Louisa, that it is
      governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate.’</p>
     <p>‘While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can, and the little I am fit for.  What
      does it matter?’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words; replying, ‘How,
      matter?  What matter, my dear?’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby,’ she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding this, ‘asks me to
      marry him.  The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?  That is so, father, is
      it not?  You have told me so, father.  Have you not?’</p>
     <p>‘Certainly, my dear.’</p>
     <p>‘Let it be so.  Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied to accept his
      proposal.  Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer.  Repeat it, word
      for word, if you can, because I should wish him to know what I said.’</p>
     <p>‘It is quite right, my dear,’ retorted her father approvingly, ‘to be exact.  I will observe
      your very proper request.  Have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage, my
      child?’</p>
     <p>‘None, father.  What does it matter!’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her hand.  But, her
      repetition of these words seemed to strike with some little discord on his ear.  He paused to
      look at her, and, still holding her hand, said:</p>
     <p>‘Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you one question, because the possibility
      implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.  But perhaps I ought to do so.  You have never
      entertained in secret any other proposal?’</p>
     <p>‘Father,’ she returned, almost scornfully, ‘what other proposal can have been made to
       <hi>me</hi>?  Whom have I seen?  Where have I been?  What are my heart’s experiences?’</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, reassured and satisfied.  ‘You correct me justly. 
      I merely wished to discharge my duty.’</p>
     <p>‘What do <hi>I</hi> know, father,’ said Louisa in her quiet manner, ‘of tastes and fancies;
      of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature in which such light things might
      have been nourished?  What escape have I had from problems that could be demonstrated, and
      realities that could be grasped?’  As she said it, she unconsciously closed her hand, as if
      upon a solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or ash.</p>
     <p>‘My dear,’ assented her eminently practical parent, ‘quite true, quite true.’</p>
     <p>‘Why, father,’ she pursued, ‘what a strange question to ask <hi>me</hi>!  The
      baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children, has never had its innocent
      resting-place in my breast.  You have been so careful of me, that I never had a child’s
      heart.  You have trained me so well, that I never dreamed a child’s dream.  You have dealt so
      wisely with me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that I never had a child’s belief or a
      child’s fear.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this testimony to it.  ‘My dear
      Louisa,’ said he, ‘you abundantly repay my care.  Kiss me, my dear girl.’</p>
     <p>So, his daughter kissed him.  Detaining her in his embrace, he said, ‘I may assure you now,
      my favourite child, that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived.  Mr.
      Bounderby is a very remarkable man; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you
      — if any — is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired.  It has always
      been my object so to educate you, as that you might, while still in your early youth, be (if I
      may so express myself) almost any age.  Kiss me once more, Louisa.  Now, let us go and find
      your mother.’</p>
     <p>Accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady with no nonsense
      about her, was recumbent as usual, while Sissy worked beside her.  She gave some feeble signs
      of returning animation when they entered, and presently the faint transparency was presented
      in a sitting attitude.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband, who had waited for the achievement of this feat with
      some impatience, ‘allow me to present to you Mrs. Bounderby.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, ‘so you have settled it!  Well, I’m sure I hope your health may
      be good, Louisa; for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married, which was the
      case with mine, I cannot consider that you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think
      you are, as all girls do.  However, I give you
      <pb n=" 79"/>joy, my dear — and I hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good
      account, I am sure I do!  I must give you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa; but don’t touch my
      right shoulder, for there’s something running down it all day long.  And now you see,’
      whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the affectionate ceremony, ‘I shall be
      worrying myself, morning, noon, and night, to know what I am to call him!’</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband, solemnly, ‘what do you mean?’</p>
     <p>‘Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he is married to Louisa!  I must call him
      something.  It’s impossible,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a mingled sense of politeness and
      injury, ‘to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name.  I cannot call him
      Josiah, for the name is insupportable to me.  You yourself wouldn’t hear of Joe, you very well
      know.  Am I to call my own son-in-law, Mister!  Not, I believe, unless the time has arrived
      when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my relations.  Then, what am I to call
      him!’</p>
     <p>Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency, Mrs. Gradgrind
      departed this life for the time being, after delivering the following codicil to her remarks
      already executed:</p>
     <p>‘As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is, — and I ask it with a fluttering in my chest,
      which actually extends to the soles of my feet, — that it may take place soon.  Otherwise, I
      know it is one of those subjects I shall never hear the last of.’</p>
     <p>When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had suddenly turned her head, and
      looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in a multitude of emotions, towards Louisa. 
      Louisa had known it, and seen it, without looking at her.  From that moment she was impassive,
      proud and cold — held Sissy at a distance — changed to her altogether.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVI HUSBAND AND WIFE</head>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby’s first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was occasioned by
      the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.  He could not make up his mind how to do that,
      or what the consequences of the step might be.  Whether she would instantly depart, bag and
      baggage, to Lady Scadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether she
      would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would break her heart, or break
      the looking-glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all foresee.  However, as it must be done, he had
      no choice but to do it; so, after attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he
      resolved to do it by word of mouth.</p>
     <p>On his way home, on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose, he took the
      precaution of stepping into a chemist’s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest
      smelling-salts.  ‘By George!’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘if she takes it in the fainting way, I’ll
      have the skin off her nose, at all events!’  But, in spite of being thus forearmed, he entered
      his own house with anything but a courageous air; and appeared before the object of his
      misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of coming direct from the pantry.</p>
     <p>‘Good evening, Mr. Bounderby!’</p>
     <p>‘Good evening, ma’am, good evening.’  He drew up his chair, and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers,
      as who should say, ‘Your fireside, sir.  I freely admit it.  It is for you to occupy it all,
      if you think proper.’</p>
     <p>‘Don’t go to the North Pole, ma’am!’ said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned, though short of her former position.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a stiff, sharp pair of scissors,
      she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental purpose, in a piece of cambric.  An
      operation which, taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, suggested with
      some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird.  She was so
      steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before she looked up from her work; when she
      did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her attention with a hitch of his head.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his pockets, and assuring
      himself with his right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready for use, ‘I have no
      occasion to say to you, that you are not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible
      woman.’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ returned the lady, ‘this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with
      similar expressions of your good opinion.’</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘I am going to astonish you.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir?’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most tranquil manner
      possible.  She generally wore mittens, and she now laid down her work, and smoothed those
      mittens.</p>
     <p>‘I am going, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘to marry Tom Gradgrind’s daughter.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘I hope you may be happy, Mr. Bounderby.  Oh, indeed I
      hope you may be happy, sir!’  And she said it with such great condescension as well as with
      such great compassion for him, that Bounderby, — far more disconcerted than if she had thrown
      her workbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug, — corked up the smelling-salts tight
      in his pocket, and thought, ‘Now confound this woman, who could have even guessed that she
      would take it in this way!’</p>
     <p>‘I wish with all my heart, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, in a highly superior manner; somehow she
      seemed, in a moment, to have established a right to pity him ever afterwards; ‘that you may be
      in all respects very happy.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am,’ returned Bounderby, with some resentment in his tone: which was clearly
      lowered, though in spite of himself, ‘I am obliged to you.  I hope I shall be.’</p>
     <p>‘<hi>Do</hi> you, sir!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability.  ‘But naturally you do; of
      course you do.’</p>
     <p>A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby’s part, succeeded.  Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her
      work and occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the cough of conscious strength
      and forbearance.</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am,’ resumed Bounderby, ‘under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be
      agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome
      here.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!’ Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still
      in her highly superior manner, and a little changed the small cough — coughing now, as if the
      spirit of prophecy rose within her, but had better be coughed down.</p>
     <p>‘However, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred
      lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than otherwise; and if the same terms —
      ’</p>
     <p>‘I beg your pardon, sir.  You were so good as to promise that you would always substitute
      the phrase, annual compliment.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am, annual compliment.  If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there,
      why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘The proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall
      assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale —
      ’</p>
     <p>‘Why, of course it is,’ said Bounderby.  ‘If it was not, ma’am, you don’t suppose that I
      should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in.  Not that <hi>I</hi>
      care for such society, you know!  But <hi>you</hi> do.’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.’</p>
     <p>‘You’ll have your own private apartments, and you’ll have your coals and your candles, and
      all the rest of it, and you’ll have your maid to attend upon you, and you’ll have your light
      porter to protect you, and you’ll be what I take the liberty of considering precious
      comfortable,’ said Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say no more.  In yielding up my trust here, I shall not be
      freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence:’ she might have said the
      sweetbread, for that delicate article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: ‘and
      I would rather receive it from your hand, than from any other.  Therefore, sir, I accept your
      offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours.  And I hope, sir,’
      said Mrs. Sparsit, concluding in an impressively compassionate manner, ‘I fondly hope that
      Miss Gradgrind may be all you desire, and deserve!’</p>
     <p>Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more.  It was in vain for Bounderby to
      bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive ways; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have
      compassion on him, as a Victim.  She was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more
      polite, the more obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary altogether,
      she; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he.  She had that tenderness for his melancholy fate,
      that his great red countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at
      him.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks’ time, and Mr.
      Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted wooer.  Love was made on these
      occasions in the form of bracelets; and, on all occasions during the period of betrothal, took
      a manufacturing aspect.  Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were made,
      settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of Facts did appropriate honour to the
      contract.  The business was all Fact, from first to last.  The Hours did not go through any of
      those rosy performances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times; neither did
      the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other seasons.  The deadly statistical
      recorder in the Gradgrind observatory knocked every second on the head as it was born, and
      buried it with his accustomed regularity.</p>
     <p>So the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason; and when it
      came, there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs — that popular order of
      architecture — Josiah Bounderby Esquire of Coketown, to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas
      Gradgrind Esquire of Stone Lodge, M.P. for that borough.  And when they were united in holy
      matrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid.</p>
     <p>There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything
      they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what
      quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it.  The
      bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit
      helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the company.</p>
     <p>After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms:</p>
     <p>‘Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Since you have done my wife and
      myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the
      same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won’t
      expect a speech from a man who, when he sees a Post, says “that’s a Post,” and when he sees a
      Pump, says “that’s a Pump,” and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or
      either of them a Toothpick.  If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law,
      Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it.  I am not your man. 
      However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how
      little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind’s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who
      never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I
      hope I may be excused.  So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don’t, I can’t help
      it.  I <hi>do</hi> feel independent.  Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am
      this day married to Tom Gradgrind’s daughter.  I am very glad to be so.  It has long been my
      wish to be so.  I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me.  At the
      same time — not to deceive you — I believe I am worthy of her.  So, I thank you, on both our
      parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried
      part of the present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have
      found.  And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found.’</p>
     <p>Shortly after which oration, as they were going on a nuptial trip to Lyons, in order that
      Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts, and
      whether they, too, required to be fed with gold spoons; the happy pair departed for the
      railroad.  The bride, in passing down-stairs, dressed for her journey, found Tom waiting for
      her — flushed, either with his feelings, or the vinous part of the breakfast.</p>
     <p>‘What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate sister, Loo!’ whispered Tom.</p>
     <p>She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day, and was a
      little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time.</p>
     <p>‘Old Bounderby’s quite ready,’ said Tom.  ‘Time’s up.  Good-bye!  I shall be on the look-out
      for you, when you come back.  I say, my dear Loo!  <hi>An’t</hi> it uncommonly jolly now!’</p>

     <head>CHAPTER I EFFECTS IN THE BANK</head>
     <p>A <hi>sunny</hi> midsummer day.  There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown.</p>
     <p>Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which
      appeared impervious to the sun’s rays.  You only knew the town was there, because you knew
      there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town.  A blur of soot
      and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven,
      now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a
      dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of
      darkness: — Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could
      be seen.</p>
     <p>The wonder was, it was there at all.  It had been ruined so often, that it was amazing how
      it had borne so many shocks.  Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as that of which
      the millers of Coketown were made.  Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with
      such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.  They were ruined, when
      they were required to send labouring children to school; they were ruined when inspectors were
      appointed to look into their works; they were ruined, when such inspectors considered it
      doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery; they
      were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much
      smoke.  Besides Mr. Bounderby’s gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown, another
      prevalent fiction was very popular there.  It took the form of a threat.  Whenever a
      Coketowner felt he was ill-used — that is to say, whenever he was not left entirely alone, and
      it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences of any of his acts — he was sure
      to come out with the awful menace, that he would ‘sooner pitch his property into the
      Atlantic.’  This had terrified the Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several
      occasions.</p>
     <p>However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had pitched their
      property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had been kind enough to take mighty good
      care of it.  So there it was, in the haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied.</p>
     <p>The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so bright that it even
      shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and could not be looked at steadily. 
      Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts,
      and palings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.  The whole town seemed to
      be frying in oil.  There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere.  The steam-engines shone
      with it, the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories
      oozed and trickled it.  The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the
      simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert.  But no
      temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane.  Their wearisome heads
      went up and down at the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather and dry, fair weather
      and foul.  The measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was the substitute Coketown had
      to show for the shadows of rustling woods; while, for the summer hum of insects, it could
      offer, all the year round, from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whirr of
      shafts and wheels.</p>
     <p>Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the passenger more sleepy and more
      hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills.  Sun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a
      little cooled the main streets and the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked
      at a fierce heat.  Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some Coketown boys
      who were at large — a rare sight there — rowed a crazy boat, which made a spumous track upon
      the water as it jogged along, while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.  But the sun
      itself, however beneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and rarely
      looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life.  So
      does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye, when incapable or sordid hands are
      interposed between it and the things it looks upon to bless.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank, on the shadier side of the frying
      street.  Office-hours were over: and at that period of the day, in warm weather, she usually
      embellished with her genteel presence, a managerial board-room over the public office.  Her
      own private sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of observation she
      was ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he came across the road, with the
      sympathizing recognition appropriate to a Victim.  He had been married now a year; and Mrs.
      Sparsit had never released him from her determined pity a moment.</p>
     <p>The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town.  It was another red
      brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street-door up two
      white steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full stop.  It was a size larger
      than Mr. Bounderby’s house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller; in
      all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the desks and writing
      implements, she shed a feminine, not to say also aristocratic, grace upon the office.  Seated,
      with her needlework or netting apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense of
      correcting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the place.  With this
      impression of her interesting character upon her, Mrs. Sparsit considered herself, in some
      sort, the Bank Fairy.  The townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there,
      regarded her as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.</p>
     <p>What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did.  Gold and silver coin,
      precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons
      (generally, however, people whom she disliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue
      thereof.  For the rest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the
      office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks, against the door of which
      strong chamber the light porter laid his head every night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared
      at cockcrow.  Further, she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply
      spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the relics of the current
      day’s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of
      paper torn so small, that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs.
      Sparsit tried.  Lastly, she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and carbines,
      arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official chimney-pieces; and over that respectable
      tradition never to be separated from a place of business claiming to be wealthy — a row of
      fire-buckets — vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any occasion, but observed
      to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal to bullion, on most beholders.</p>
     <p>A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit’s empire.  The deaf
      serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying had for years gone about among the
      lower orders of Coketown, that she would be murdered some night when the Bank was shut, for
      the sake of her money.  It was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some time,
      and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and her situation, with an
      ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit’s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its tripod of legs in
      an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the stern,
      leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room.  The light porter
      placed the tea-tray on it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Thank <hi>you</hi>, ma’am,’ returned the light porter.  He was a very light porter indeed;
      as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a horse, for girl number twenty.</p>
     <p>‘All is shut up, Bitzer?’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘All is shut up, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘And what,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea, ‘is the news of the day?  Anything?’</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am, I can’t say that I have heard anything particular.  Our people are a bad lot,
      ma’am; but that is no news, unfortunately.’</p>
     <p>‘What are the restless wretches doing now?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Merely going on in the old way, ma’am.  Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one
      another.’</p>
     <p>‘It is much to be regretted,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows
      more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity, ‘that the united masters allow of any such
      class-combinations.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Bitzer.</p>
     <p>‘Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any
      man who is united with any other man,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘They have done that, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer; ‘but it rather fell through, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘I do not pretend to understand these things,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, ‘my lot
      having been signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being
      also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions.  I only know that these people must be
      conquered, and that it’s high time it was done, once for all.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit’s
      oracular authority.  ‘You couldn’t put it clearer, I am sure, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as
      he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a
      pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her
      tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street.</p>
     <p>‘Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Not a very busy day, my lady.  About an average day.’  He now and then slided into my lady,
      instead of ma’am, as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs. Sparsit’s personal dignity and
      claims to reverence.</p>
     <p>‘The clerks,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and
      butter from her left-hand mitten, ‘are trustworthy, punctual, and industrious, of course?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am, pretty fair, ma’am.  With the usual exception.’</p>
     <p>He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the establishment, for which
      volunteer service he received a present at Christmas, over and above his weekly wage.  He had
      grown into an extremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man, who was safe to rise in the
      world.  His mind was so exactly regulated, that he had no affections or passions.  All his
      proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation; and it was not without
      cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him, that he was a young man of the steadiest
      principle she had ever known.  Having satisfied himself, on his father’s death, that his
      mother had a right of settlement in Coketown, this excellent young economist had asserted that
      right for her with such a steadfast adherence to the principle of the case, that she had been
      shut up in the workhouse ever since.  It must be admitted that he allowed her half a pound of
      tea a year, which was weak in him: first, because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to
      pauperise the recipient, and secondly, because his only reasonable transaction in that
      commodity would have been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it for
      as much as he could possibly get; it having been clearly ascertained by philosophers that in
      this is comprised the whole duty of man — not a part of man’s duty, but the whole.</p>
     <p>‘Pretty fair, ma’am.  With the usual exception, ma’am,’ repeated Bitzer.</p>
     <p>‘Ah — h!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking a long gulp.</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Thomas, ma’am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma’am, I don’t like his ways at all.’</p>
     <p>‘Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, ‘do you recollect my having said
      anything to you respecting names?’</p>
     <p>‘I beg your pardon, ma’am.  It’s quite true that you did object to names being used, and
      they’re always best avoided.’</p>
     <p>‘Please to remember that I have a charge here,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with her air of state. 
      ‘I hold a trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby.  However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and
      myself might have deemed it years ago, that he would ever become my patron, making me an
      annual compliment, I cannot but regard him in that light.  From Mr. Bounderby I have received
      every acknowledgment of my social station, and every recognition of my family descent, that I
      could possibly expect.  More, far more.  Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true. 
      And I do not consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with a most
      extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, ‘that I <hi>should</hi> be scrupulously true,
      if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof, that are unfortunately — most
      unfortunately — no doubt of that — connected with his.’</p>
     <p>Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon.</p>
     <p>‘No, Bitzer,’ continued Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr.
      Thomas, and you must excuse me.’</p>
     <p>‘With the usual exception, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, trying back, ‘of an individual.’</p>
     <p>‘Ah — h!’  Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup,
      and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been
      interrupted.</p>
     <p>‘An individual, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘has never been what he ought to have been, since he
      first came into the place.  He is a dissipated, extravagant idler.  He is not worth his salt,
      ma’am.  He wouldn’t get it either, if he hadn’t a friend and relation at court, ma’am!’</p>
     <p>‘Ah — h!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head.</p>
     <p>‘I only hope, ma’am,’ pursued Bitzer, ‘that his friend and relation may not supply him with
      the means of carrying on.  Otherwise, ma’am, we know out of whose pocket <hi>that</hi> money
      comes.’</p>
     <p>‘Ah — h!’ sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her head.</p>
     <p>‘He is to be pitied, ma’am.  The last party I have alluded to, is to be pitied, ma’am,’ said
      Bitzer.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘I have always pitied the delusion, always.’</p>
     <p>‘As to an individual, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing nearer, ‘he is as
      improvident as any of the people in this town.  And you know what <hi>their</hi> improvidence
      is, ma’am.  No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does.’</p>
     <p>‘They would do well,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘to take example by you, Bitzer.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, ma’am.  But, since you do refer to me, now look at me, ma’am.  I have put by a
      little, ma’am, already.  That gratuity which I receive at Christmas, ma’am: I never touch it. 
      I don’t even go the length of my wages, though they’re not high, ma’am.  Why can’t they do as
      I have done, ma’am?  What one person can do, another can do.’</p>
     <p>This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.  Any capitalist there, who had made sixty
      thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand nearest
      Hands didn’t each make sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them
      every one for not accomplishing the little feat.  What I did you can do.  Why don’t you go and
      do it?</p>
     <p>‘As to their wanting recreations, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘it’s stuff and nonsense.  <hi>I</hi>
      don’t want recreations.  I never did, and I never shall; I don’t like ’em.  As to their
      combining together; there are many of them, I have no doubt, that by watching and informing
      upon one another could earn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve
      their livelihood.  Then, why don’t they improve it, ma’am!  It’s the first consideration of a
      rational creature, and it’s what they pretend to want.’</p>
     <p>‘Pretend indeed!’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma’am, till it becomes quite nauseous, concerning
      their wives and families,’ said Bitzer.  ‘Why look at me, ma’am!  I don’t want a wife and
      family.  Why should they?’</p>
     <p>‘Because they are improvident,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer, ‘that’s where it is.  If they were more provident and less
      perverse, ma’am, what would they do?  They would say, “While my hat covers my family,” or
      “while my bonnet covers my family,” — as the case might be, ma’am — “I have only one to feed,
      and that’s the person I most like to feed.”’</p>
     <p>‘To be sure,’ assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin.</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return for the favour of
      Mrs. Sparsit’s improving conversation.  ‘Would you wish a little more hot water, ma’am, or is
      there anything else that I could fetch you?’</p>
     <p>‘Nothing just now, Bitzer.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, ma’am.  I shouldn’t wish to disturb you at your meals, ma’am, particularly tea,
      knowing your partiality for it,’ said Bitzer, craning a little to look over into the street
      from where he stood; ‘but there’s a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma’am,
      and he has come across as if he was going to knock.  That <hi>is</hi> his knock, ma’am, no
      doubt.’</p>
     <p>He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again, confirmed himself
      with, ‘Yes, ma’am.  Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma’am?’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t know who it can be,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and arranging her
      mittens.</p>
     <p>‘A stranger, ma’am, evidently.’</p>
     <p>‘What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless he comes upon some
      business for which he is too late, I don’t know,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘but I hold a charge in
      this establishment from Mr. Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.  If to see him is any
      part of the duty I have accepted, I will see him.  Use your own discretion, Bitzer.’</p>
     <p>Here the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit’s magnanimous words, repeated his knock so
      loudly that the light porter hastened down to open the door; while Mrs. Sparsit took the
      precaution of concealing her little table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and
      then decamped up-stairs, that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.</p>
     <p>‘If you please, ma’am, the gentleman would wish to see you,’ said Bitzer, with his light eye
      at Mrs. Sparsit’s keyhole.  So, Mrs. Sparsit, who had improved the interval by touching up her
      cap, took her classical features down-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the manner
      of a Roman matron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general.</p>
     <p>The visitor having strolled to the window, and being then engaged in looking carelessly out,
      was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man could possibly be.  He stood whistling to
      himself with all imaginable coolness, with his hat still on, and a certain air of exhaustion
      upon him, in part arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive gentility.  For it
      was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough gentleman, made to the model of the
      time; weary of everything, and putting no more faith in anything than Lucifer.</p>
     <p>‘I believe, sir,’ quoth Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you wished to see me.’</p>
     <p>‘I beg your pardon,’ he said, turning and removing his hat; ‘pray excuse me.’</p>
     <p>‘Humph!’ thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she made a stately bend.  ‘Five and thirty, good-looking,
      good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding, well-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.’  All
      which Mrs. Sparsit observed in her womanly way — like the Sultan who put his head in the pail
      of water — merely in dipping down and coming up again.</p>
     <p>‘Please to be seated, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Thank you.  Allow me.’  He placed a chair for her, but remained himself carelessly lounging
      against the table.  ‘I left my servant at the railway looking after the luggage — very heavy
      train and vast quantity of it in the van — and strolled on, looking about me.  Exceedingly odd
      place.  Will you allow me to ask you if it’s <hi>always</hi> as black as this?’</p>
     <p>‘In general much blacker,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, in her uncompromising way.</p>
     <p>‘Is it possible!  Excuse me: you are not a native, I think?’</p>
     <p>‘No, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘It was once my good or ill fortune, as it may be —
      before I became a widow — to move in a very different sphere.  My husband was a Powler.’</p>
     <p>‘Beg your pardon, really!’ said the stranger.  ‘Was — ?’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit repeated, ‘A Powler.’</p>
     <p>‘Powler Family,’ said the stranger, after reflecting a few moments.  Mrs. Sparsit signified
      assent.  The stranger seemed a little more fatigued than before.</p>
     <p>‘You must be very much bored here?’ was the inference he drew from the communication.</p>
     <p>‘I am the servant of circumstances, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘and I have long adapted myself
      to the governing power of my life.’</p>
     <p>‘Very philosophical,’ returned the stranger, ‘and very exemplary and laudable, and — ’  It
      seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the sentence, so he played with his
      watch-chain wearily.</p>
     <p>‘May I be permitted to ask, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘to what I am indebted for the favour
      of — ’</p>
     <p>‘Assuredly,’ said the stranger.  ‘Much obliged to you for reminding me.  I am the bearer of
      a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the banker.  Walking through this extraordinarily
      black town, while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met;
      one of the working people; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of something fluffy,
      which I assume to be the raw material — ’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit inclined her head.</p>
     <p>‘ — Raw material — where Mr. Bounderby, the banker, might reside.  Upon which, misled no
      doubt by the word Banker, he directed me to the Bank.  Fact being, I presume, that Mr.
      Bounderby the Banker does <hi>not</hi> reside in the edifice in which I have the honour of
      offering this explanation?’</p>
     <p>‘No, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘he does not.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you.  I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment, nor have I.
      But strolling on to the Bank to kill time, and having the good fortune to observe at the
      window,’ towards which he languidly waved his hand, then slightly bowed, ‘a lady of a very
      superior and agreeable appearance, I considered that I could not do better than take the
      liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker <hi>does</hi> live.  Which I
      accordingly venture, with all suitable apologies, to do.’</p>
     <p>The inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved, to Mrs. Sparsit’s
      thinking, by a certain gallantry at ease, which offered her homage too.  Here he was, for
      instance, at this moment, all but sitting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her, as if
      he acknowledged an attraction in her that made her charming — in her way.</p>
     <p>‘Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially must be,’ said the stranger, whose
      lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant likewise; suggesting matter far more sensible
      and humorous than it ever contained — which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this
      numerous sect, whosoever may have been that great man: ‘therefore I may observe that my letter
      — here it is — is from the member for this place — Gradgrind — whom I have had the pleasure of
      knowing in London.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was quite unnecessary,
      and gave Mr. Bounderby’s address, with all needful clues and directions in aid.</p>
     <p>‘Thousand thanks,’ said the stranger.  ‘Of course you know the Banker well?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘In my dependent relation towards him, I have known him
      ten years.’</p>
     <p>‘Quite an eternity!  I think he married Gradgrind’s daughter?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her mouth, ‘he had that — honour.’</p>
     <p>‘The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘<hi>Is</hi> she?’</p>
     <p>‘Excuse my impertinent curiosity,’ pursued the stranger, fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit’s
      eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, ‘but you know the family, and know the world.  I am about
      to know the family, and may have much to do with them.  Is the lady so very alarming?  Her
      father gives her such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning desire to
      know.  Is she absolutely unapproachable?  Repellently and stunningly clever?  I see, by your
      meaning smile, you think not.  You have poured balm into my anxious soul.  As to age, now. 
      Forty?  Five and thirty?’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright.  ‘A chit,’ said she.  ‘Not twenty when she was married.’</p>
     <p>‘I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,’ returned the stranger, detaching himself from the
      table, ‘that I never was so astonished in my life!’</p>
     <p>It really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his capacity of being impressed. 
      He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a minute, and appeared to have the surprise
      in his mind all the time.  ‘I assure you, Mrs. Powler,’ he then said, much exhausted, ‘that
      the father’s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.  I am obliged to you, of all
      things, for correcting so absurd a mistake.  Pray excuse my intrusion.  Many thanks.  Good
      day!’</p>
     <p>He bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw him languishing
      down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of all the town.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 94"/>‘What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?’ she asked the light porter, when he
      came to take away.</p>
     <p>‘Spends a deal of money on his dress, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘It must be admitted,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘that it’s very tasteful.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer, ‘if that’s worth the money.’</p>
     <p>‘Besides which, ma’am,’ resumed Bitzer, while he was polishing the table, ‘he looks to me as
      if he gamed.’</p>
     <p>‘It’s immoral to game,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘It’s ridiculous, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘because the chances are against the players.’</p>
     <p>Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or whether it was that her
      hand was out, she did no work that night.  She sat at the window, when the sun began to sink
      behind the smoke; she sat there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from
      it, when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the
      house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of the factory chimneys, up to the sky. 
      Without a candle in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not
      thinking much of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the
      rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs
      upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-shutters.  Not
      until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit
      arouse herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows — by that time creased
      with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.</p>
     <p>‘O, you Fool!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  Whom she meant, she did
      not say; but she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER II MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE</head>
     <p>The Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces.  They
      went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully, than among the
      fine gentlemen who, having found out everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for
      anything?</p>
     <p>Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were attractive to many
      of the Gradgrind school.  They liked fine gentlemen; they pretended that they did not, but
      they did.  They became exhausted in imitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like
      them; and they served out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political
      economy, on which they regaled their disciples.  There never before was seen on earth such a
      wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced.</p>
     <p>Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school, there was one of a
      good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn of humour which had told immensely with
      the House of Commons on the occasion of his entertaining it with his (and the Board of
      Directors) view of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever known, employed
      by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by the finest mechanical contrivances
      ever devised, the whole in action on the best line ever constructed, had killed five people
      and wounded thirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole system would
      have been positively incomplete.  Among the slain was a cow, and among the scattered articles
      unowned, a widow’s cap.  And the honourable member had so tickled the House (which has a
      delicate sense of humour) by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any
      serious reference to the Coroner’s Inquest, and brought the railway off with Cheers and
      Laughter.</p>
     <p>Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself, who had
      tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the
      train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem,
      and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere.  To
      whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, ‘Jem, there’s a good
      opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men.  I wonder you don’t go in for
      statistics.’  Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was
      as ready to ‘go in’ for statistics as for anything else.  So, he went in.  He coached himself
      up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and
      said, ‘If you want to bring in, for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good
      speech, look after my brother Jem, for he’s your man.’  After a few dashes in the public
      meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was
      resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood.  Hence
      the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand;
      superscribed, ‘Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.  Specially to introduce James
      Harthouse, Esquire.  Thomas Gradgrind.’</p>
     <p>Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse’s card, Mr. Bounderby
      put on his hat and went down to the Hotel.  There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of
      window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to ‘go in’ for
      something else.</p>
     <p>‘My name, sir,’ said his visitor, ‘is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.’</p>
     <p>Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure
      he had long expected.</p>
     <p>‘Coketown, sir,’ said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, ‘is not the kind of place you
      have been accustomed to.  Therefore, if you will allow me — or whether you will or not, for I
      am a plain man — I’ll tell you something about it before we go any further.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Harthouse would be charmed.</p>
     <p>‘Don’t be too sure of that,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I don’t promise it.  First of all, you see
      our smoke.  That’s meat and drink to us.  It’s the healthiest thing in the world in all
      respects, and particularly for the lungs.  If you are one of those who want us to consume it,
      I differ from you.  We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we
      wear ’em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.’</p>
     <p>By way of ‘going in’ to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, ‘Mr. Bounderby, I assure
      you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking.  On conviction.’</p>
     <p>‘I am glad to hear it,’ said Bounderby.  ‘Now, you have heard a lot of talk about the work
      in our mills, no doubt.  You have?  Very good.  I’ll state the fact of it to you.  It’s the
      pleasantest work there is, and it’s the lightest work there is, and it’s the best-paid work
      there is.  More than that, we couldn’t improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down
      Turkey carpets on the floors.  Which we’re not a-going to do.’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.’</p>
     <p>‘Lastly,’ said Bounderby, ‘as to our Hands.  There’s not a Hand in this town, sir, man,
      woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life.  That object is, to be fed on turtle
      soup and venison with a gold spoon.  Now, they’re not a-going — none of ’em — ever to be fed
      on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.  And now you know the place.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and refreshed, by this
      condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question.</p>
     <p>‘Why, you see,’ replied Mr. Bounderby, ‘it suits my disposition to have a full understanding
      with a man, particularly with a public man, when I make his acquaintance.  I have only one
      thing more to say to you, Mr. Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I
      shall respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind’s letter of
      introduction.  You are a man of family.  Don’t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment
      that I am a man of family.  I am a bit of dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag,
      and bobtail.’</p>
     <p>If anything could have exalted Jem’s interest in Mr. Bounderby, it would have been this very
      circumstance.  Or, so he told him.</p>
     <p>‘So now,’ said Bounderby, ‘we may shake hands on equal terms.  I say, equal terms, because
      although I know what I am, and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of,
      better than any man does, I am as proud as you are.  I am just as proud as you are.  Having
      now asserted my independence in a proper manner, I may come to how do you find yourself, and I
      hope you’re pretty well.’</p>
     <p>The better, Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands, for the salubrious air
      of Coketown.  Mr. Bounderby received the answer with favour.</p>
     <p>‘Perhaps you know,’ said he, ‘or perhaps you don’t know, I married Tom Gradgrind’s
      daughter.  If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me, I shall be glad to
      introduce you to Tom Gradgrind’s daughter.’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby,’ said Jem, ‘you anticipate my dearest wishes.’</p>
     <p>They went out without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who
      so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red brick dwelling, with the black outside
      shutters, the green inside blinds, and the black street door up the two white steps.  In the
      drawing-room of which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr.
      James Harthouse had ever seen.  She was so constrained, and yet so careless; so reserved, and
      yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so sensitively ashamed of her husband’s braggart
      humility — from which she shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was
      quite a new sensation to observe her.  In face she was no less remarkable than in manner.  Her
      features were handsome; but their natural play was so locked up, that it seemed impossible to
      guess at their genuine expression.  Utterly indifferent, perfectly self-reliant, never at a
      loss, and yet never at her ease, with her figure in company with them there, and her mind
      apparently quite alone — it was of no use ‘going in’ yet awhile to comprehend this girl, for
      she baffled all penetration.</p>
     <p>From the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to the house itself.  There was no mute
      sign of a woman in the room.  No graceful little adornment, no fanciful little device, however
      trivial, anywhere expressed her influence.  Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly
      rich, there the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved by the least
      trace of any womanly occupation.  As Mr. Bounderby stood in the midst of his household gods,
      so those unrelenting divinities occupied their places around Mr. Bounderby, and they were
      worthy of one another, and well matched.</p>
     <p>‘This, sir,’ said Bounderby, ‘is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind’s eldest daughter. 
      Loo, Mr. James Harthouse.  Mr. Harthouse has joined your father’s muster-roll.  If he is not
      Tom Gradgrind’s colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion
      with one of our neighbouring towns.  You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior.  I
      don’t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she
      wouldn’t have married me.  She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. 
      If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser
      than Loo Bounderby.’</p>
     <p>To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to learn, Mr.
      Harthouse could never be recommended.</p>
     <p>‘Come!’ said his host.  ‘If you’re in the complimentary line, you’ll get on here, for you’ll
      meet with no competition.  I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I
      don’t profess to understand the art of paying ’em.  In fact, despise ’em.  But, your
      bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George!  You’re a gentleman,
      and I don’t pretend to be one.  I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, and that’s enough for me. 
      However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be.  She hadn’t
      my advantages — disadvantages you would call ’em, but I call ’em advantages — so you’ll not
      waste your power, I dare say.’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby,’ said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, ‘is a noble animal in a
      comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like
      myself works.’</p>
     <p>‘You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,’ she quietly returned.  ‘It is natural that you
      should.’</p>
     <p>He was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of the world, and
      thought, ‘Now, how am I to take this?’</p>
     <p>‘You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said, to the
      service of your country.  You have made up your mind,’ said Louisa, still standing before him
      where she had first stopped — in all the singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her
      being obviously very ill at ease — ‘to show the nation the way out of all its
      difficulties.’</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ he returned, laughing, ‘upon my honour, no.  I will make no such pretence
      to you.  I have seen a little, here and there, up and down; I have found it all to be very
      worthless, as everybody has, and as some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in
      for your respected father’s opinions — really because I have no choice of opinions, and may as
      well back them as anything else.’</p>
     <p>‘Have you none of your own?’ asked Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘I have not so much as the slightest predilection left.  I assure you I attach not the least
      importance to any opinions.  The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone, is a
      conviction (unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on
      the subject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set, and just as
      much harm as any other set.  There’s an English family with a charming Italian motto.  What
      will be, will be.  It’s the only truth going!’</p>
     <p>This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty — a vice so dangerous, so deadly, and so
      common — seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his favour.  He followed up the
      advantage, by saying in his pleasantest manner: a manner to which she might attach as much or
      as little meaning as she pleased: ‘The side that can prove anything in a line of units, tens,
      hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the most fun, and to give a man
      the best chance.  I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it.  I am quite ready to
      go in for it, to the same extent as if I believed it.  And what more could I possibly do, if I
      did believe it!’</p>
     <p>‘You are a singular politician,’ said Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Pardon me; I have not even that merit.  We are the largest party in the state, I assure
      you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed here with a project
      for postponing the family dinner till half-past six, and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the
      meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its
      vicinity.  The round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his
      blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a considerable accession of boredom.</p>
     <p>In the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat down only three.  It
      was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of the hap’orth of stewed
      eels he had purchased in the streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water,
      specially used for laying the dust, with which he had washed down that repast.  He likewise
      entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the calculation that he (Bounderby) had
      eaten in his youth at least three horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.  These
      recitals, Jem, in a languid manner, received with ‘charming!’ every now and then; and they
      probably would have decided him to ‘go in’ for Jerusalem again to-morrow morning, had he been
      less curious respecting Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Is there nothing,’ he thought, glancing at her as she sat at the head of the table, where
      her youthful figure, small and slight, but
      <pb n=" 100"/>very graceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; ‘is there nothing that
      will move that face?’</p>
     <p>Yes!  By Jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected shape.  Tom
      appeared.  She changed as the door opened, and broke into a beaming smile.</p>
     <p>A beautiful smile.  Mr. James Harthouse might not have thought so much of it, but that he
      had wondered so long at her impassive face.  She put out her hand — a pretty little soft hand;
      and her fingers closed upon her brother’s, as if she would have carried them to her lips.</p>
     <p>‘Ay, ay?’ thought the visitor.  ‘This whelp is the only creature she cares for.  So,
      so!’</p>
     <p>The whelp was presented, and took his chair.  The appellation was not flattering, but not
      unmerited.</p>
     <p>‘When I was your age, young Tom,’ said Bounderby, ‘I was punctual, or I got no dinner!’</p>
     <p>‘When you were my age,’ resumed Tom, ‘you hadn’t a wrong balance to get right, and hadn’t to
      dress afterwards.’</p>
     <p>‘Never mind that now,’ said Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Well, then,’ grumbled Tom.  ‘Don’t begin with me.’</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ said Harthouse, perfectly hearing this under-strain as it went on; ‘your
      brother’s face is quite familiar to me.  Can I have seen him abroad?  Or at some public
      school, perhaps?’</p>
     <p>‘No,’ she resumed, quite interested, ‘he has never been abroad yet, and was educated here,
      at home.  Tom, love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that he never saw you abroad.’</p>
     <p>‘No such luck, sir,’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>There was little enough in him to brighten her face, for he was a sullen young fellow, and
      ungracious in his manner even to her.  So much the greater must have been the solitude of her
      heart, and her need of some one on whom to bestow it.  ‘So much the more is this whelp the
      only creature she has ever cared for,’ thought Mr. James Harthouse, turning it over and over. 
      ‘So much the more.  So much the more.’</p>
     <p>Both in his sister’s presence, and after she had left the room, the whelp took no pains to
      hide his contempt for Mr. Bounderby, whenever he could indulge it without the observation of
      that independent man, by making wry faces, or shutting one eye.  Without responding to these
      telegraphic communications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the evening,
      and showed an unusual liking for him.  At last, when he rose to return to his hotel, and was a
      little doubtful whether he knew the way by night, the whelp immediately proffered his services
      as guide, and turned out with him to escort him thither.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER III THE WHELP</head>
     <p>It was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up under one
      continuous system of unnatural restraint, should be a hypocrite; but it was certainly the case
      with Tom.  It was very strange that a young gentleman who had never been left to his own
      guidance for five consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing himself; but
      so it was with Tom.  It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination
      had been strangled in his cradle, should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of
      grovelling sensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was Tom.</p>
     <p>‘Do you smoke?’ asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel.</p>
     <p>‘I believe you!’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up.  What with a
      cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco
      than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end
      of the sofa, and more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.</p>
     <p>Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation
      of his friend.  ‘He don’t seem to care about his dress,’ thought Tom, ‘and yet how capitally
      he does it.  What an easy swell he is!’</p>
     <p>Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom’s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and
      filled his glass with his own negligent hand.</p>
     <p>‘Thank’ee,’ said Tom.  ‘Thank’ee.  Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of
      old Bounderby to-night.’  Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass
      knowingly, at his entertainer.</p>
     <p>‘A very good fellow indeed!’ returned Mr. James Harthouse.</p>
     <p>‘You think so, don’t you?’ said Tom.  And shut up his eye again.</p>
     <p>Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back
      against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front
      of Tom and looking down at him, observed:</p>
     <p>‘What a comical brother-in-law you are!’</p>
     <p>‘What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>‘You are a piece of caustic, Tom,’ retorted Mr. James Harthouse.</p>
     <p>There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being
      called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon,
      with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself.</p>
     <p>‘Oh!  I don’t care for old Bounderby,’ said he, ‘if you mean that.  I have always called old
      Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him, and I have always thought of him in
      the same way.  I am not going to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby.  It would be
      rather late in the day.’</p>
     <p>‘Don’t mind me,’ returned James; ‘but take care when his wife is by, you know.’</p>
     <p>‘His wife?’ said Tom.  ‘My sister Loo?  O yes!’  And he laughed, and took a little more of
      the cooling drink.</p>
     <p>James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude, smoking his cigar in his
      own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the whelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of
      agreeable demon who had only to hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul if
      required.  It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence.  He looked at his
      companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at him boldly, and put up one leg
      on the sofa.</p>
     <p>‘My sister Loo?’ said Tom.  ‘<hi>She</hi> never cared for old Bounderby.’</p>
     <p>‘That’s the past tense, Tom,’ returned Mr. James Harthouse, striking the ash from his cigar
      with his little finger.  ‘We are in the present tense, now.’</p>
     <p>‘Verb neuter, not to care.  Indicative mood, present tense.  First person singular, I do not
      care; second person singular, thou dost not care; third person singular, she does not care,’
      returned Tom.</p>
     <p>‘Good!  Very quaint!’ said his friend.  ‘Though you don’t mean it.’</p>
     <p>‘But I <hi>do</hi> mean it,’ cried Tom.  ‘Upon my honour!  Why, you won’t tell me, Mr.
      Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby.’</p>
     <p>‘My dear fellow,’ returned the other, ‘what am I bound to suppose, when I find two married
      people living in harmony and happiness?’</p>
     <p>Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa.  If his second leg had not been already
      there when he was called a dear fellow, he would have put it up at that great stage of the
      conversation.  Feeling it necessary to do something then, he stretched himself out at greater
      length, and, reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa, and smoking with an
      infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common face, and not too sober eyes, towards the
      face looking down upon him so carelessly yet so potently.</p>
     <p>‘You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,’ said Tom, ‘and therefore, you needn’t be surprised
      that Loo married old Bounderby.  She never had a lover, and the governor proposed old
      Bounderby, and she took him.’</p>
     <p>‘Very dutiful in your interesting sister,’ said Mr. James Harthouse.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, but she wouldn’t have been as dutiful, and it would not have come off as easily,’
      returned the whelp, ‘if it hadn’t been for me.’</p>
     <p>The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go on.</p>
     <p>‘<hi>I</hi> persuaded her,’ he said, with an edifying air of superiority.  ‘I was stuck into
      old Bounderby’s bank (where I never wanted to be), and I knew I should get into scrapes there,
      if she put old Bounderby’s pipe out; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them.  She
      would do anything for me.  It was very game of her, wasn’t it?’</p>
     <p>‘It was charming, Tom!’</p>
     <p>‘Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me,’ continued Tom coolly,
      ‘because my liberty and comfort, and perhaps my getting on, depended on it; and she had no
      other lover, and staying at home was like staying in jail — especially when I was gone.  It
      wasn’t as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby; but still it was a good thing in
      her.’</p>
     <p>‘Perfectly delightful.  And she gets on so placidly.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh,’ returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage, ‘she’s a regular girl.  A girl can get on
      anywhere.  She has settled down to the life, and <hi>she</hi> don’t mind.  It does just as
      well as another.  Besides, though Loo is a girl, she’s not a common sort of girl.  She can
      shut herself up within herself, and think — as I have often known her sit and watch the fire —
      for an hour at a stretch.’</p>
     <p>‘Ay, ay?  Has resources of her own,’ said Harthouse, smoking quietly.</p>
     <p>‘Not so much of that as you may suppose,’ returned Tom; ‘for our governor had her crammed
      with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust.  It’s his system.’</p>
     <p>‘Formed his daughter on his own model?’ suggested Harthouse.</p>
     <p>‘His daughter?  Ah! and everybody else.  Why, he formed Me that way!’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>‘Impossible!’</p>
     <p>‘He did, though,’ said Tom, shaking his head.  ‘I mean to say, Mr. Harthouse, that when I
      first left home and went to old Bounderby’s, I was as flat as a warming-pan, and knew no more
      about life, than any oyster does.’</p>
     <p>‘Come, Tom!  I can hardly believe that.  A joke’s a joke.’</p>
     <p>‘Upon my soul!’ said the whelp.  ‘I am serious; I am indeed!’  He smoked with great gravity
      and dignity for a little while, and then added, in a highly complacent tone, ‘Oh!  I have
      picked up a little since.  I don’t deny that.  But I have done it myself; no thanks to the
      governor.’</p>
     <p>‘And your intelligent sister?’</p>
     <p>‘My intelligent sister is about where she was.  She used to complain to me that she had
      nothing to fall back upon, that girls usually fall back upon; and I don’t see how she is to
      have got over that since.  But <hi>she</hi> don’t mind,’ he sagaciously added, puffing at his
      cigar again.  ‘Girls can always get on, somehow.’</p>
     <p>‘Calling at the Bank yesterday evening, for Mr. Bounderby’s address, I found an ancient lady
      there, who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister,’ observed Mr. James Harthouse,
      throwing away the last small remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out.</p>
     <p>‘Mother Sparsit!’ said Tom.  ‘What! you have seen her already, have you?’</p>
     <p>His friend nodded.  Tom took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his eye (which had grown
      rather unmanageable) with the greater expression, and to tap his nose several times with his
      finger.</p>
     <p>‘Mother Sparsit’s feeling for Loo is more than admiration, I should think,’ said Tom.  ‘Say
      affection and devotion.  Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Bounderby when he was a
      bachelor.  Oh no!’</p>
     <p>These were the last words spoken by the whelp, before a giddy drowsiness came upon him,
      followed by complete oblivion.  He was roused from the latter state by an uneasy dream of
      being stirred up with a boot, and also of a voice saying: ‘Come, it’s late.  Be off!’</p>
     <p>‘Well!’ he said, scrambling from the sofa.  ‘I must take my leave of you though.  I say. 
      Yours is very good tobacco.  But it’s too mild.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, it’s too mild,’ returned his entertainer.</p>
     <p>‘It’s — it’s ridiculously mild,’ said Tom.  ‘Where’s the door!  Good night!’</p>
     <p>‘He had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter through a mist, which, after giving him
      some trouble and difficulty, resolved itself into the main street, in which he stood alone. 
      He then walked home pretty easily, though not yet free from an impression of the presence and
      influence of his new friend — as if he were lounging somewhere in the air, in the same
      negligent attitude, regarding him with the same look.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 105"/>The whelp went home, and went to bed.  If he had had any sense of what he had
      done that night, and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother, he might have turned
      short on the road, might have gone down to the ill-smelling river that was dyed black, might
      have gone to bed in it for good and all, and have curtained his head for ever with its filthy
      waters.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER IV MEN AND BROTHERS</head>
     <p>‘<hi>Oh</hi>, my friends, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown!  Oh, my friends and
      fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism!  Oh, my friends and
      fellow-sufferers, and fellow-workmen, and fellow-men!  I tell you that the hour is come, when
      we must rally round one another as One united power, and crumble into dust the oppressors that
      too long have battened upon the plunder of our families, upon the sweat of our brows, upon the
      labour of our hands, upon the strength of our sinews, upon the God-created glorious rights of
      Humanity, and upon the holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!’</p>
     <p>‘Good!’  ‘Hear, hear, hear!’  ‘Hurrah!’ and other cries, arose in many voices from various
      parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close Hall, in which the orator, perched on a
      stage, delivered himself of this and what other froth and fume he had in him.  He had
      declaimed himself into a violent heat, and was as hoarse as he was hot.  By dint of roaring at
      the top of his voice under a flaring gaslight, clenching his fists, knitting his brows,
      setting his teeth, and pounding with his arms, he had taken so much out of himself by this
      time, that he was brought to a stop, and called for a glass of water.</p>
     <p>As he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of water, the comparison
      between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces turned towards him, was extremely to his
      disadvantage.  Judging him by Nature’s evidence, he was above the mass in very little but the
      stage on which he stood.  In many great respects he was essentially below them.  He was not so
      honest, he was not so manly, he was not so good-humoured; he substituted cunning for their
      simplicity, and passion for their safe solid sense.  An ill-made, high-shouldered man, with
      lowering brows, and his features crushed into an habitually sour expression, he contrasted
      most unfavourably, even in his mongrel dress, with the great body of his hearers in their
      plain working clothes.  Strange as it always is to consider any assembly in the act of
      submissively resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person, lord or commoner,
      whom three-fourths of it could, by no human means, raise out of the slough of inanity to their
      own intellectual level, it was particularly strange, and it was even particularly affecting,
      to see this crowd of earnest faces, whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from
      bias could doubt, so agitated by such a leader.</p>
     <p>Good!  Hear, hear!  Hurrah!  The eagerness both of attention and intention, exhibited in all
      the countenances, made them a most impressive sight.  There was no carelessness, no languor,
      no idle curiosity; none of the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies,
      visible for one moment there.  That every man felt his condition to be, somehow or other,
      worse than it might be; that every man considered it incumbent on him to join the rest,
      towards the making of it better; that every man felt his only hope to be in his allying
      himself to the comrades by whom he was surrounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong
      (unhappily wrong then), the whole of that crowd were gravely, deeply, faithfully in earnest;
      must have been as plain to any one who chose to see what was there, as the bare beams of the
      roof and the whitened brick walls.  Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own
      breast, that these men, through their very delusions, showed great qualities, susceptible of
      being turned to the happiest and best account; and that to pretend (on the strength of
      sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried) that they went astray wholly without cause, and of
      their own irrational wills, was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire, death
      without birth, harvest without seed, anything or everything produced from nothing.</p>
     <p>The orator having refreshed himself, wiped his corrugated forehead from left to right
      several times with his handkerchief folded into a pad, and concentrated all his revived
      forces, in a sneer of great disdain and bitterness.</p>
     <p>‘But oh, my friends and brothers!  Oh, men and Englishmen, the down-trodden operatives of
      Coketown!  What shall we say of that man — that working-man, that I should find it necessary
      so to libel the glorious name — who, being practically and well acquainted with the grievances
      and wrongs of you, the injured pith and marrow of this land, and having heard you, with a
      noble and majestic unanimity that will make Tyrants tremble, resolve for to subscribe to the
      funds of the United Aggregate Tribunal, and to abide by the injunctions issued by that body
      for your benefit, whatever they may be — what, I ask you, will you say of that working-man,
      since such I must acknowledge him to be, who, at such a time, deserts his post, and sells his
      flag; who, at such a time, turns a traitor and a craven and a recreant, who, at such a time,
      is not ashamed to make to you the dastardly and humiliating avowal that he will hold himself
      aloof, and will <hi>not</hi> be one of those associated in the gallant stand for Freedom and
      for Right?’</p>
     <p>The assembly was divided at this point.  There were some groans and hisses, but the general
      sense of honour was much too strong for the condemnation of a man unheard.  ‘Be sure you’re
      right, Slackbridge!’  ‘Put him up!’  ‘Let’s hear him!’  Such things were said on many sides. 
      Finally, one strong voice called out, ‘Is the man heer?  If the man’s heer, Slackbridge, let’s
      hear the man himseln, ’stead o’ yo.’  Which was received with a round of applause.</p>
     <p>Slackbridge, the orator, looked about him with a withering smile; and, holding out his right
      hand at arm’s length (as the manner of all Slackbridges is), to still the thundering sea,
      waited until there was a profound silence.</p>
     <p>‘Oh, my friends and fellow-men!’ said Slackbridge then, shaking his head with violent scorn,
      ‘I do not wonder that you, the prostrate sons of labour, are incredulous of the existence of
      such a man.  But he who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed, and Judas Iscariot
      existed, and Castlereagh existed, and this man exists!’</p>
     <p>Here, a brief press and confusion near the stage, ended in the man himself standing at the
      orator’s side before the concourse.  He was pale and a little moved in the face — his lips
      especially showed it; but he stood quiet, with his left hand at his chin, waiting to be
      heard.  There was a chairman to regulate the proceedings, and this functionary now took the
      case into his own hands.</p>
     <p>‘My friends,’ said he, ‘by virtue o’ my office as your president, I askes o’ our friend
      Slackbridge, who may be a little over hetter in this business, to take his seat, whiles this
      man Stephen Blackpool is heern.  You all know this man Stephen Blackpool.  You know him awlung
      o’ his misfort’ns, and his good name.’</p>
     <p>With that, the chairman shook him frankly by the hand, and sat down again.  Slackbridge
      likewise sat down, wiping his hot forehead — always from left to right, and never the reverse
      way.</p>
     <p>‘My friends,’ Stephen began, in the midst of a dead calm; ‘I ha’ hed what’s been spok’n o’
      me, and ’tis lickly that I shan’t mend it.  But I’d liefer you’d hearn the truth concernin
      myseln, fro my lips than fro onny other man’s, though I never cud’n speak afore so monny,
      wi’out bein moydert and muddled.’</p>
     <p>Slackbridge shook his head as if he would shake it off, in his bitterness.</p>
     <p>‘I’m th’ one single Hand in Bounderby’s mill, o’ a’ the men theer, as don’t coom in wi’ th’
      proposed reg’lations.  I canna coom in wi’ ’em.  My friends, I doubt their doin’ yo onny
      good.  Licker they’ll do yo hurt.’</p>
     <p>Slackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned sarcastically.</p>
     <p>‘But ’t an’t sommuch for that as I stands out.  If that were aw, I’d coom in wi’ th’ rest. 
      But I ha’ my reasons — mine, yo see — for being hindered; not on’y now, but awlus — awlus —
      life long!’</p>
     <p>Slackbridge jumped up and stood beside him, gnashing and tearing.  ‘Oh, my friends, what but
      this did I tell you?  Oh, my fellow-countrymen, what warning but this did I give you?  And how
      shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?  Oh,
      you Englishmen, I ask you how does this subornation show in one of yourselves, who is thus
      consenting to his own undoing and to yours, and to your children’s and your children’s
      children’s?’</p>
     <p>There was some applause, and some crying of Shame upon the man; but the greater part of the
      audience were quiet.  They looked at Stephen’s worn face, rendered more pathetic by the homely
      emotions it evinced; and, in the kindness of their nature, they were more sorry than
      indignant.</p>
     <p>‘’Tis this Delegate’s trade for t’ speak,’ said Stephen, ‘an’ he’s paid for ’t, an’ he knows
      his work.  Let him keep to ’t.  Let him give no heed to what I ha had’n to bear.  That’s not
      for him.  That’s not for nobbody but me.’</p>
     <p>There was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words, that made the hearers yet more
      quiet and attentive.  The same strong voice called out, ‘Slackbridge, let the man be heern,
      and howd thee tongue!’  Then the place was wonderfully still.</p>
     <p>‘My brothers,’ said Stephen, whose low voice was distinctly heard, ‘and my fellow-workmen —
      for that yo are to me, though not, as I knows on, to this delegate here — I ha but a word to
      sen, and I could sen nommore if I was to speak till Strike o’ day.  I know weel, aw what’s
      afore me.  I know weel that yo aw resolve to ha nommore ado wi’ a man who is not wi’ yo in
      this matther.  I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i’ th’ road, yo’d feel it right to
      pass me by, as a forrenner and stranger.  What I ha getn, I mun mak th’ best on.’</p>
     <p>‘Stephen Blackpool,’ said the chairman, rising, ‘think on ’t agen.  Think on ’t once agen,
      lad, afore thou’rt shunned by aw owd friends.’</p>
     <p>There was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no man articulated a word.  Every
      eye was fixed on Stephen’s face.  To repent of his determination, would be to take a load from
      all their minds.  He looked around him, and knew that it was so.  Not a grain of anger with
      them was in his heart; he knew them, far below their surface weaknesses and misconceptions, as
      no one but their fellow-labourer could.</p>
     <p>‘I ha thowt on ’t, above a bit, sir.  I simply canna coom in.  I mun go th’ way as lays
      afore me.  I mun tak my leave o’ aw heer.’</p>
     <p>He made a sort of reverence to them by holding up his arms, and stood for the moment in that
      attitude; not speaking until they slowly dropped at his sides.</p>
     <p>‘Monny’s the pleasant word as soom heer has spok’n wi’ me; monny’s the face I see heer, as I
      first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart’n than now.  I ha’ never had no fratch afore,
      sin ever I were born, wi’ any o’ my like; Gonnows I ha’ none now that’s o’ my makin’.  Yo’ll
      ca’ me traitor and that — yo I mean t’ say,’ addressing Slackbridge, ‘but ’tis easier to ca’
      than mak’ out.  So let be.’</p>
     <p>He had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform, when he remembered something
      he had not said, and returned again.</p>
     <p>‘Haply,’ he said, turning his furrowed face slowly about, that he might as it were
      individually address the whole audience, those both near and distant; ‘haply, when this
      question has been tak’n up and discoosed, there’ll be a threat to turn out if I’m let to work
      among yo.  I hope I shall die ere ever such a time cooms, and I shall work solitary among yo
      unless it cooms — truly, I mun do ’t, my friends; not to brave yo, but to live.  I ha nobbut
      work to live by; and wheerever can I go, I who ha worked sin I were no heighth at aw, in
      Coketown heer?  I mak’ no complaints o’ bein turned to the wa’, o’ bein outcasten and
      overlooken fro this time forrard, but hope I shall be let to work.  If there is any right for
      me at aw, my friends, I think ’tis that.’</p>
     <p>Not a word was spoken.  Not a sound was audible in the building, but the slight rustle of
      men moving a little apart, all along the centre of the room, to open a means of passing out,
      to the man with whom they had all bound themselves to renounce companionship.  Looking at no
      one, and going his way with a lowly steadiness upon him that asserted nothing and sought
      nothing, Old Stephen, with all his troubles on his head, left the scene.</p>
     <p>Then Slackbridge, who had kept his oratorical arm extended during the going out, as if he
      were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a wonderful moral power the vehement passions
      of the multitude, applied himself to raising their spirits.  Had not the Roman Brutus, oh, my
      British countrymen, condemned his son to death; and had not the Spartan mothers, oh my soon to
      be victorious friends, driven their flying children on the points of their enemies’ swords? 
      Then was it not the sacred duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before them, an
      admiring world in company with them, and a posterity to come after them, to hurl out traitors
      from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a God-like cause?  The winds of heaven
      answered Yes; and bore Yes, east, west, north, and south.  And consequently three cheers for
      the United Aggregate Tribunal!</p>
     <p>Slackbridge acted as fugleman, and gave the time.  The multitude of doubtful faces (a little
      conscience-stricken) brightened at the sound, and took it up.  Private feeling must yield to
      the common cause.  Hurrah!  The roof yet vibrated with the cheering, when the assembly
      dispersed.</p>
     <p>Thus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives, the life of solitude
      among a familiar crowd.  The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some
      answering look and never finds it, is in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten
      averted faces daily, that were once the countenances of friends.  Such experience was to be
      Stephen’s now, in every waking moment of his life; at his work, on his way to it and from it,
      at his door, at his window, everywhere.  By general consent, they even avoided that side of
      the street on which he habitually walked; and left it, of all the working men, to him
      only.</p>
     <p>He had been for many years, a quiet silent man, associating but little with other men, and
      used to companionship with his own thoughts.  He had never known before the strength of the
      want in his heart for the frequent recognition of a nod, a look, a word; or the immense amount
      of relief that had been poured into it by drops through such small means.  It was even harder
      than he could have believed possible, to separate in his own conscience his abandonment by all
      his fellows from a baseless sense of shame and disgrace.</p>
     <p>The first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy, that he began to be
      appalled by the prospect before him.  Not only did he see no Rachael all the time, but he
      avoided every chance of seeing her; for, although he knew that the prohibition did not yet
      formally extend to the women working in the factories, he found that some of them with whom he
      was acquainted were changed to him, and he feared to try others, and dreaded that Rachael
      might be even singled out from the rest if she were seen in his company.  So, he had been
      quite alone during the four days, and had spoken to no one, when, as he was leaving his work
      at night, a young man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street.</p>
     <p>‘Your name’s Blackpool, ain’t it?’ said the young man.</p>
     <p>Stephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand, in his gratitude for being spoken
      to, or in the suddenness of it, or both.  He made a feint of adjusting the lining, and said,
      ‘Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry, I mean?’ said Bitzer, the very light young man
      in question.</p>
     <p>Stephen answered ‘Yes,’ again.</p>
     <p>‘I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away from you.  Mr. Bounderby wants to
      speak to you.  You know his house, don’t you?’</p>
     <p>Stephen said ‘Yes,’ again.</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 111"/>‘Then go straight up there, will you?’ said Bitzer.  ‘You’re expected, and have
      only to tell the servant it’s you.  I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me
      (I was sent to fetch you), you’ll save me a walk.’</p>
     <p>Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as
      in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER V MEN AND MASTERS</head>
     <p>‘<hi>Well</hi>, Stephen,’ said Bounderby, in his windy manner, ‘what’s this I hear?  What
      have these pests of the earth been doing to <hi>you</hi>?  Come in, and speak up.’</p>
     <p>It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden.  A tea-table was set out; and Mr.
      Bounderby’s young wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present.  To
      whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his
      hand.</p>
     <p>‘This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  The gentleman he
      addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, saying in an indolent way,
      ‘Oh really?’ and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood.</p>
     <p>‘Now,’ said Bounderby, ‘speak up!’</p>
     <p>After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen’s
      ear.  Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really
      was the self-interested deserter he had been called.</p>
     <p>‘What were it, sir,’ said Stephen, ‘as yo were pleased to want wi’ me?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, I have told you,’ returned Bounderby.  ‘Speak up like a man, since you are a man, and
      tell us about yourself and this Combination.’</p>
     <p>‘Wi’ yor pardon, sir,’ said Stephen Blackpool, ‘I ha’ nowt to sen about it.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a Wind, finding something in his way here,
      began to blow at it directly.</p>
     <p>‘Now, look here, Harthouse,’ said he, ‘here’s a specimen of ’em.  When this man was here
      once before, I warned this man against the mischievous strangers who are always about — and
      who ought to be hanged wherever they are found — and I told this man that he was going in the
      wrong direction.  Now, would you believe it, that although they have put this mark upon him,
      he is such a slave to them still, that he’s afraid to open his lips about them?’</p>
     <p>‘I sed as I had nowt to sen, sir; not as I was fearfo’ o’ openin’ my lips.’</p>
     <p>‘You said!  Ah!  <hi>I</hi> know what you said; more than that, I know what you mean, you
      see.  Not always the same thing, by the Lord Harry!  Quite different things.  You had better
      tell us at once, that that fellow Slackbridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to
      mutiny; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that is, a most
      confounded scoundrel.  You had better tell us so at once; you can’t deceive me.  You want to
      tell us so.  Why don’t you?’</p>
     <p>‘I’m as sooary as yo, sir, when the people’s leaders is bad,’ said Stephen, shaking his
      head.  ‘They taks such as offers.  Haply ’tis na’ the sma’est o’ their misfortuns when they
      can get no better.’</p>
     <p>The wind began to get boisterous.</p>
     <p>‘Now, you’ll think this pretty well, Harthouse,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘You’ll think this
      tolerably strong.  You’ll say, upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to
      deal with; but this is nothing, sir!  You shall hear me ask this man a question.  Pray, Mr.
      Blackpool’ — wind springing up very fast — ‘may I take the liberty of asking you how it
      happens that you refused to be in this Combination?’</p>
     <p>‘How ’t happens?’</p>
     <p>‘Ah!’ said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the arms of his coat, and jerking his head and
      shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite wall: ‘how it happens.’</p>
     <p>‘I’d leefer not coom to ’t, sir; but sin you put th’ question — an’ not want’n t’ be
      ill-manner’n — I’ll answer.  I ha passed a promess.’</p>
     <p>‘Not to me, you know,’ said Bounderby.  (Gusty weather with deceitful calms.  One now
      prevailing.)</p>
     <p>‘O no, sir.  Not to yo.’</p>
     <p>‘As for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it,’ said
      Bounderby, still in confidence with the wall.  ‘If only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown had been
      in question, you would have joined and made no bones about it?’</p>
     <p>‘Why yes, sir.  ’Tis true.’</p>
     <p>‘Though he knows,’ said Mr. Bounderby, now blowing a gale, ‘that there are a set of rascals
      and rebels whom transportation is too good for!  Now, Mr. Harthouse, you have been knocking
      about in the world some time.  Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this
      blessed country?’  And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an angry finger.</p>
     <p>‘Nay, ma’am,’ said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly protesting against the words that had been
      used, and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa, after glancing at her face.  ‘Not
      rebels, nor yet rascals.  Nowt o’ th’ kind, ma’am, nowt o’ th’ kind.  They’ve not doon me a
      kindness, ma’am, as I know and feel.  But there’s not a dozen men amoong ’em, ma’am — a
      dozen?  Not six — but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by himseln.  God
      forbid as I, that ha’ known, and had’n experience o’ these men aw my life — I, that ha’ ett’n
      an’ droonken wi’ ’em, an’ seet’n wi’ ’em, and toil’n wi’ ’em, and lov’n ’em, should fail fur
      to stan by ’em wi’ the truth, let ’em ha’ doon to me what they may!’</p>
     <p>He spoke with the rugged earnestness of his place and character — deepened perhaps by a
      proud consciousness that he was faithful to his class under all their mistrust; but he fully
      remembered where he was, and did not even raise his voice.</p>
     <p>‘No, ma’am, no.  They’re true to one another, faithfo’ to one another, ’fectionate to one
      another, e’en to death.  Be poor amoong ’em, be sick amoong ’em, grieve amoong ’em for onny o’
      th’ monny causes that carries grief to the poor man’s door, an’ they’ll be tender wi’ yo,
      gentle wi’ yo, comfortable wi’ yo, Chrisen wi’ yo.  Be sure o’ that, ma’am.  They’d be riven
      to bits, ere ever they’d be different.’</p>
     <p>‘In short,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘it’s because they are so full of virtues that they have
      turned you adrift.  Go through with it while you are about it.  Out with it.’</p>
     <p>‘How ’tis, ma’am,’ resumed Stephen, appearing still to find his natural refuge in Louisa’s
      face, ‘that what is best in us fok, seems to turn us most to trouble an’ misfort’n an’
      mistake, I dunno.  But ’tis so.  I know ’tis, as I know the heavens is over me ahint the
      smoke.  We’re patient too, an’ wants in general to do right.  An’ I canna think the fawt is aw
      wi’ us.’</p>
     <p>‘Now, my friend,’ said Mr. Bounderby, whom he could not have exasperated more, quite
      unconscious of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to any one else, ‘if you will
      favour me with your attention for half a minute, I should like to have a word or two with
      you.  You said just now, that you had nothing to tell us about this business.  You are quite
      sure of that before we go any further.’</p>
     <p>‘Sir, I am sure on ’t.’</p>
     <p>‘Here’s a gentleman from London present,’ Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded point at Mr. James
      Harthouse with his thumb, ‘a Parliament gentleman.  I should like him to hear a short bit of
      dialogue between you and me, instead of taking the substance of it — for I know precious well,
      beforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than I do, take notice! — instead of
      receiving it on trust from my mouth.’</p>
     <p>Stephen bent his head to the gentleman from London, and showed a rather more troubled mind
      than usual.  He turned his eyes involuntarily to his former refuge, but at a look from that
      quarter (expressive though instantaneous) he settled them on Mr. Bounderby’s face.</p>
     <p>‘Now, what do you complain of?’ asked Mr. Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ not coom here, sir,’ Stephen reminded him, ‘to complain.  I coom for that I were sent
      for.’</p>
     <p>‘What,’ repeated Mr. Bounderby, folding his arms, ‘do you people, in a general way, complain
      of?’</p>
     <p>Stephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a moment, and then seemed to make up
      his mind.</p>
     <p>‘Sir, I were never good at showin o ’t, though I ha had’n my share in feeling o ’t.  ’Deed
      we are in a muddle, sir.  Look round town — so rich as ’tis — and see the numbers o’ people as
      has been broughten into bein heer, fur to weave, an’ to card, an’ to piece out a livin’, aw
      the same one way, somehows, ’twixt their cradles and their graves.  Look how we live, an’
      wheer we live, an’ in what numbers, an’ by what chances, and wi’ what sameness; and look how
      the mills is awlus a goin, and how they never works us no nigher to ony dis’ant object —
      ceptin awlus, Death.  Look how you considers of us, and writes of us, and talks of us, and
      goes up wi’ yor deputations to Secretaries o’ State ’bout us, and how yo are awlus right, and
      how we are awlus wrong, and never had’n no reason in us sin ever we were born.  Look how this
      ha growen an’ growen, sir, bigger an’ bigger, broader an’ broader, harder an’ harder, fro year
      to year, fro generation unto generation.  Who can look on ’t, sir, and fairly tell a man ’tis
      not a muddle?’</p>
     <p>‘Of course,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Now perhaps you’ll let the gentleman know, how you would
      set this muddle (as you’re so fond of calling it) to rights.’</p>
     <p>‘I donno, sir.  I canna be expecten to ’t.  ’Tis not me as should be looken to for that,
      sir.  ’Tis them as is put ower me, and ower aw the rest of us.  What do they tak upon
      themseln, sir, if not to do’t?’</p>
     <p>‘I’ll tell you something towards it, at any rate,’ returned Mr. Bounderby.  ‘We will make an
      example of half a dozen Slackbridges.  We’ll indict the blackguards for felony, and get ’em
      shipped off to penal settlements.’</p>
     <p>Stephen gravely shook his head.</p>
     <p>‘Don’t tell me we won’t, man,’ said Mr. Bounderby, by this time blowing a hurricane,
      ‘because we will, I tell you!’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ returned Stephen, with the quiet confidence of absolute certainty, ‘if yo was t’ tak
      a hundred Slackbridges — aw as there is, and aw the number ten times towd — an’ was t’ sew ’em
      up in separate sacks, an’ sink ’em in the deepest ocean as were made ere ever dry land coom to
      be, yo’d leave the muddle just wheer ’tis.  Mischeevous strangers!’ said Stephen, with an
      anxious smile; ‘when ha we not heern, I am sure, sin ever we can call to mind, o’ th’
      mischeevous strangers!  ’Tis not by <hi>them</hi> the trouble’s made, sir.  ’Tis not wi’
       <hi>them</hi> ’t commences.  I ha no favour for ’em — I ha no reason to favour ’em — but ’tis
      hopeless and useless to dream o’ takin them fro their trade, ’stead o’ takin their trade fro
      them!  Aw that’s now about me in this room were heer afore I coom, an’ will be heer when I am
      gone.  Put that clock aboard a ship an’ pack it off to Norfolk Island, an’ the time will go on
      just the same.  So ’tis wi’ Slackbridge every bit.’</p>
     <p>Reverting for a moment to his former refuge, he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes
      towards the door.  Stepping back, he put his hand upon the lock.  But he had not spoken out of
      his own will and desire; and he felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious
      treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him.  He stayed to finish
      what was in his mind.</p>
     <p>‘Sir, I canna, wi’ my little learning an’ my common way, tell the genelman what will better
      aw this — though some working men o’ this town could, above my powers — but I can tell him
      what I know will never do ’t.  The strong hand will never do ’t.  Vict’ry and triumph will
      never do ’t.  Agreeing fur to mak one side unnat’rally awlus and for ever right, and toother
      side unnat’rally awlus and for ever wrong, will never, never do ’t.  Nor yet lettin alone will
      never do ’t.  Let thousands upon thousands alone, aw leading the like lives and aw faw’en into
      the like muddle, and they will be as one, and yo will be as anoother, wi’ a black unpassable
      world betwixt yo, just as long or short a time as sich-like misery can last.  Not drawin nigh
      to fok, wi’ kindness and patience an’ cheery ways, that so draws nigh to one another in their
      monny troubles, and so cherishes one another in their distresses wi’ what they need themseln —
      like, I humbly believe, as no people the genelman ha seen in aw his travels can beat — will
      never do ’t till th’ Sun turns t’ ice.  Most o’ aw, rating ’em as so much Power, and reg’latin
      ’em as if they was figures in a soom, or machines: wi’out loves and likens, wi’out memories
      and inclinations, wi’out souls to weary and souls to hope — when aw goes quiet, draggin on wi’
      ’em as if they’d nowt o’ th’ kind, and when aw goes onquiet, reproachin ’em for their want o’
      sitch humanly feelins in their dealins wi’ yo — this will never do ’t, sir, till God’s work is
      onmade.’</p>
     <p>Stephen stood with the open door in his hand, waiting to know if anything more were expected
      of him.</p>
     <p>‘Just stop a moment,’ said Mr. Bounderby, excessively red in the face.  ‘I told you, the
      last time you were here with a grievance, that you had better turn about and come out of
      that.  And I also told you, if you remember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-out.’</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 116"/>‘I were not up to ’t myseln, sir; I do assure yo.’</p>
     <p>‘Now it’s clear to me,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘that you are one of those chaps who have always
      got a grievance.  And you go about, sowing it and raising crops.  That’s the business of
       <hi>your</hi> life, my friend.’</p>
     <p>Stephen shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed he had other business to do for his
      life.</p>
     <p>‘You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap, you see,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘that
      even your own Union, the men who know you best, will have nothing to do with you.  I never
      thought those fellows could be right in anything; but I tell you what!  I so far go along with
      them for a novelty, that <hi>I</hi>’ll have nothing to do with you either.’</p>
     <p>Stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face.</p>
     <p>‘You can finish off what you’re at,’ said Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning nod, ‘and then go
      elsewhere.’</p>
     <p>‘Sir, yo know weel,’ said Stephen expressively, ‘that if I canna get work wi’ yo, I canna
      get it elsewheer.’</p>
     <p>The reply was, ‘What I know, I know; and what you know, you know.  I have no more to say
      about it.’</p>
     <p>Stephen glanced at Louisa again, but her eyes were raised to his no more; therefore, with a
      sigh, and saying, barely above his breath, ‘Heaven help us aw in this world!’ he departed.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VI FADING AWAY</head>
     <p>It was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby’s house.  The shadows of
      night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed the door, but
      plodded straight along the street.  Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old
      woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step behind
      him that he knew, and turning, saw her in Rachael’s company.</p>
     <p>He saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only.</p>
     <p>‘Ah, Rachael, my dear!  Missus, thou wi’ her!’</p>
     <p>‘Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,’ the old woman
      returned.  ‘Here I am again, you see.’</p>
     <p>‘But how wi’ Rachael?’ said Stephen, falling into their step, walking between them, and
      looking from the one to the other.</p>
     <p>‘Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you,’ said the old
      woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself.  ‘My visiting time is later this year than
      usual, for I have been rather troubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till the
      weather was fine and warm.  For the same reason I don’t make all my journey in one day, but
      divide it into two days, and get a bed to-night at the Travellers’ Coffee House down by the
      railroad (a nice clean house), and go back Parliamentary, at six in the morning.  Well, but
      what has this to do with this good lass, says you?  I’m going to tell you.  I have heard of
      Mr. Bounderby being married.  I read it in the paper, where it looked grand — oh, it looked
      fine!’ the old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm: ‘and I want to see his wife.  I have
      never seen her yet.  Now, if you’ll believe me, she hasn’t come out of that house since noon
      to-day.  So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a little last bit more, when I
      passed close to this good lass two or three times; and her face being so friendly I spoke to
      her, and she spoke to me.  There!’ said the old woman to Stephen, ‘you can make all the rest
      out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!’</p>
     <p>Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman,
      though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be.  With a gentleness
      that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that
      interested her in her old age.</p>
     <p>‘Well, missus,’ said he, ‘I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom.  Wi’ fine dark
      thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the like on.’</p>
     <p>‘Young and handsome.  Yes!’ cried the old woman, quite delighted.  ‘As bonny as a rose!  And
      what a happy wife!’</p>
     <p>‘Aye, missus, I suppose she be,’ said Stephen.  But with a doubtful glance at Rachael.</p>
     <p>‘Suppose she be?  She must be.  She’s your master’s wife,’ returned the old woman.</p>
     <p>Stephen nodded assent.  ‘Though as to master,’ said he, glancing again at Rachael, ‘not
      master onny more.  That’s aw enden ’twixt him and me.’</p>
     <p>‘Have you left his work, Stephen?’ asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly.</p>
     <p>‘Why, Rachael,’ he replied, ‘whether I ha lef’n his work, or whether his work ha lef’n me,
      cooms t’ th’ same.  His work and me are parted.  ’Tis as weel so — better, I were thinkin when
      yo coom up wi’ me.  It would ha brought’n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer.  Haply
      ’tis a kindness to monny that I go; haply ’tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done. 
      I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th’ time, and seek a fort’n, dear, by beginnin fresh.’</p>
     <p>‘Where will you go, Stephen?’</p>
     <p>‘I donno t’night,’ said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin hair with the flat
      of his hand.  ‘But I’m not goin t’night, Rachael, nor yet t’morrow.  ’Tan’t easy overmuch t’
      know wheer t’ turn, but a good heart will coom to me.’</p>
     <p>Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.  Before he had so much as
      closed Mr. Bounderby’s door, he had reflected that at least his being obliged to go away was
      good for her, as it would save her from the chance of being brought into question for not
      withdrawing from him.  Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her, and though he could
      think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not pursue him, perhaps it was
      almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days, even to unknown
      difficulties and distresses.</p>
     <p>So he said, with truth, ‘I’m more leetsome, Rachael, under ’t, than I could’n ha believed.’ 
      It was not her part to make his burden heavier.  She answered with her comforting smile, and
      the three walked on together.</p>
     <p>Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds much consideration
      among the poor.  The old woman was so decent and contented, and made so light of her
      infirmities, though they had increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that
      they both took an interest in her.  She was too sprightly to allow of their walking at a slow
      pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be talked to, and very willing to talk to
      any extent: so, when they came to their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious
      than ever.</p>
     <p>‘Come to my poor place, missus,’ said Stephen, ‘and tak a coop o’ tea.  Rachael will coom
      then; and arterwards I’ll see thee safe t’ thy Travellers’ lodgin.  ’T may be long, Rachael,
      ere ever I ha th’ chance o’ thy coompany agen.’</p>
     <p>They complied, and the three went on to the house where he lodged.  When they turned into a
      narrow street, Stephen glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate
      home; but it was open, as he had left it, and no one was there.  The evil spirit of his life
      had flitted away again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since.  The only evidence
      of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room, and the grayer hair upon his
      head.</p>
     <p>He lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from below, and brought in
      small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some butter from the nearest shop.  The bread was
      new and crusty, the butter fresh, and the sugar lump, of course — in fulfilment of the
      standard testimony of the Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes, sir. 
      Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a cup), and the visitor
      enjoyed it mightily.  It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days. 
      He too, with the world a wide heath before him, enjoyed the meal — again in corroboration of
      the magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people,
      sir.</p>
     <p>‘I ha never thowt yet, missus,’ said Stephen, ‘o’ askin thy name.’</p>
     <p>The old lady announced herself as ‘Mrs. Pegler.’</p>
     <p>‘A widder, I think?’ said Stephen.</p>
     <p>‘Oh, many long years!’  Mrs. Pegler’s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead,
      by Mrs. Pegler’s calculation, when Stephen was born.</p>
     <p>‘’Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,’ said Stephen.  ‘Onny children?’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Pegler’s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on
      her part.  ‘No,’ she said.  ‘Not now, not now.’</p>
     <p>‘Dead, Stephen,’ Rachael softly hinted.</p>
     <p>‘I’m sooary I ha spok’n on ’t,’ said Stephen, ‘I ought t’ hadn in my mind as I might touch a
      sore place.  I — I blame myseln.’</p>
     <p>While he excused himself, the old lady’s cup rattled more and more.  ‘I had a son,’ she
      said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; ‘and he did
      well, wonderfully well.  But he is not to be spoken of if you please.  He is — ’  Putting down
      her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, ‘dead!’  Then she said
      aloud, ‘I have lost him.’</p>
     <p>Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady
      came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear.  Mrs.
      Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered.</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby!’ she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table.  ‘Oh hide me! 
      Don’t let me be seen for the world.  Don’t let him come up till I’ve got away.  Pray, pray!’ 
      She trembled, and was excessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to
      reassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about.</p>
     <p>‘But hearken, missus, hearken,’ said Stephen, astonished.  ‘’Tisn’t Mr. Bounderby; ’tis his
      wife.  Yo’r not fearfo’ o’ her.  Yo was hey-go-mad about her, but an hour sin.’</p>
     <p>‘But are you sure it’s the lady, and not the gentleman?’ she asked, still trembling.</p>
     <p>‘Certain sure!’</p>
     <p>‘Well then, pray don’t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,’ said the old woman. 
      ‘Let me be quite to myself in this corner.’</p>
     <p>Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she was quite unable to give
      him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few moments returned, lighting Louisa into the
      room.  She was followed by the whelp.</p>
     <p>Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand, when Stephen,
      himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle on the table.  Then he too stood,
      with his doubled hand upon the table near it, waiting to be addressed.</p>
     <p>For the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings of the Coketown
      Hands; for the first time in her life she was face to face with anything like individuality in
      connection with them.  She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands.  She knew
      what results in work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time.  She knew
      them in crowds passing to and from their nests, like ants or beetles.  But she knew from her
      reading infinitely more of the ways of toiling insects than of these toiling men and
      women.</p>
     <p>Something to be worked so much and paid so much, and there ended; something to be infallibly
      settled by laws of supply and demand; something that blundered against those laws, and
      floundered into difficulty; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear, and
      over-ate itself when wheat was cheap; something that increased at such a rate of percentage,
      and yielded such another percentage of crime, and such another percentage of pauperism;
      something wholesale, of which vast fortunes were made; something that occasionally rose like a
      sea, and did some harm and waste (chiefly to itself), and fell again; this she knew the
      Coketown Hands to be.  But, she had scarcely thought more of separating them into units, than
      of separating the sea itself into its component drops.</p>
     <p>She stood for some moments looking round the room.  From the few chairs, the few books, the
      common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two women, and to Stephen.</p>
     <p>‘I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  I should like to be
      serviceable to you, if you will let me.  Is this your wife?’</p>
     <p>Rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped again.</p>
     <p>‘I remember,’ said Louisa, reddening at her mistake; ‘I recollect, now, to have heard your
      domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not attending to the particulars at the time.  It
      was not my meaning to ask a question that would give pain to any one here.  If I should ask
      any other question that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you please, for
      being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.’</p>
     <p>As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to her, so she now
      instinctively addressed herself to Rachael.  Her manner was short and abrupt, yet faltering
      and timid.</p>
     <p>‘He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?  You would be his first
      resource, I think.’</p>
     <p>‘I have heard the end of it, young lady,’ said Rachael.</p>
     <p>‘Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he would probably be rejected by
      all?  I thought he said as much?’</p>
     <p>‘The chances are very small, young lady — next to nothing — for a man who gets a bad name
      among them.’</p>
     <p>‘What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?’</p>
     <p>‘The name of being troublesome.’</p>
     <p>‘Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the other, he is
      sacrificed alike?  Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place
      whatever for an honest workman between them?’</p>
     <p>Rachael shook her head in silence.</p>
     <p>‘He fell into suspicion,’ said Louisa, ‘with his fellow-weavers, because — he had made a
      promise not to be one of them.  I think it must have been to you that he made that promise. 
      Might I ask you why he made it?’</p>
     <p>Rachael burst into tears.  ‘I didn’t seek it of him, poor lad.  I prayed him to avoid
      trouble for his own good, little thinking he’d come to it through me.  But I know he’d die a
      hundred deaths, ere ever he’d break his word.  I know that of him well.’</p>
     <p>Stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual thoughtful attitude, with his hand at
      his chin.  He now spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual.</p>
     <p>‘No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, an’ what love, an’ respect, I bear to
      Rachael, or wi’ what cause.  When I passed that promess, I towd her true, she were th’ Angel
      o’ my life.  ’Twere a solemn promess.  ’Tis gone fro’ me, for ever.’</p>
     <p>Louisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new in her.  She looked
      from him to Rachael, and her features softened.  ‘What will you do?’ she asked him.  And her
      voice had softened too.</p>
     <p>‘Weel, ma’am,’ said Stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; ‘when I ha finished off, I
      mun quit this part, and try another.  Fortnet or misfortnet, a man can but try; there’s nowt
      to be done wi’out tryin’ — cept laying down and dying.’</p>
     <p>‘How will you travel?’</p>
     <p>‘Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.’</p>
     <p>Louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.  The rustling of a bank-note was audible,
      as she unfolded one and laid it on the table.</p>
     <p>‘Rachael, will you tell him — for you know how, without offence — that this is freely his,
      to help him on his way?  Will you entreat him to take it?’</p>
     <p>‘I canna do that, young lady,’ she answered, turning her head aside.  ‘Bless you for
      thinking o’ the poor lad wi’ such tenderness.  But ’tis for him to know his heart, and what is
      right according to it.’</p>
     <p>Louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome with quick
      sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been so plain and steady through the
      late interview, lost his composure in a moment, and now stood with his hand before his face. 
      She stretched out hers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and remained
      still.</p>
     <p>‘Not e’en Rachael,’ said Stephen, when he stood again with his face uncovered, ‘could mak
      sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.  T’ show that I’m not a man wi’out reason and
      gratitude, I’ll tak two pound.  I’ll borrow ’t for t’ pay ’t back.  ’Twill be the sweetest
      work as ever I ha done, that puts it in my power t’ acknowledge once more my lastin
      thankfulness for this present action.’</p>
     <p>She was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the much smaller sum he had
      named.  He was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor picturesque, in any respect; and yet his
      manner of accepting it, and of expressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in it
      that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught his son in a century.</p>
     <p>Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick with sufficient
      unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage.  Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got
      up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word.</p>
     <p>‘Just wait a moment, Loo!  Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment.  Something
      comes into my head.  If you’ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I’ll mention it.  Never mind
      a light, man!’  Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. 
      ‘It don’t want a light.’</p>
     <p>Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand.</p>
     <p>‘I say!’ he whispered.  ‘I think I can do you a good turn.  Don’t ask me what it is, because
      it may not come to anything.  But there’s no harm in my trying.’</p>
     <p>His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen’s ear, it was so hot.</p>
     <p>‘That was our light porter at the Bank,’ said Tom, ‘who brought you the message to-night.  I
      call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.’</p>
     <p>Stephen thought, ‘What a hurry he is in!’  He spoke so confusedly.</p>
     <p>‘Well!’ said Tom.  ‘Now look here!  When are you off?’</p>
     <p>‘T’ day’s Monday,’ replied Stephen, considering.  ‘Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh
      ’bout.’</p>
     <p>‘Friday or Saturday,’ said Tom.  ‘Now look here!  I am not sure that I can do you the good
      turn I want to do you — that’s my sister, you know, in your room — but I may be able to, and
      if I should not be able to, there’s no harm done.  So I tell you what.  You’ll know our light
      porter again?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sure,’ said Stephen.</p>
     <p>‘Very well,’ returned Tom.  ‘When you leave work of a night, between this and your going
      away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?  Don’t take on, as if you meant
      anything, if he should see you hanging about there; because I shan’t put him up to speak to
      you, unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you.  In that case he’ll have a note
      or a message for you, but not else.  Now look here!  You are sure you understand.’</p>
     <p>He had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole of Stephen’s coat, and was
      screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round, in an extraordinary manner.</p>
     <p>‘I understand, sir,’ said Stephen.</p>
     <p>‘Now look here!’ repeated Tom.  ‘Be sure you don’t make any mistake then, and don’t forget. 
      I shall tell my sister as we go home, what I have in view, and she’ll approve, I know.  Now
      look here!  You’re all right, are you?  You understand all about it?  Very well then.  Come
      along, Loo!’</p>
     <p>He pushed the door open as he called to her, but did not return into the room, or wait to be
      lighted down the narrow stairs.  He was at the bottom when she began to descend, and was in
      the street before she could take his arm.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and sister were gone, and until Stephen
      came back with the candle in his hand.  She was in a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs.
      Bounderby, and, like an unaccountable old woman, wept, ‘because she was such a pretty dear.’ 
      Yet Mrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should return by chance, or
      anybody else should come, that her cheerfulness was ended for that night.  It was late too, to
      people who rose early and worked hard; therefore the party broke up; and Stephen and Rachael
      escorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the Travellers’ Coffee House, where they
      parted from her.</p>
     <p>They walked back together to the corner of the street where Rachael lived, and as they drew
      nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them.  When they came to the dark corner where
      their unfrequent meetings always ended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid to
      speak.</p>
     <p>‘I shall strive t’ see thee agen, Rachael, afore I go, but if not — ’</p>
     <p>‘Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know.  ’Tis better that we make up our minds to be open wi’ one
      another.’</p>
     <p>‘Thou’rt awlus right.  ’Tis bolder and better.  I ha been thinkin then, Rachael, that as
      ’tis but a day or two that remains, ’twere better for thee, my dear, not t’ be seen wi’ me. 
      ’T might bring thee into trouble, fur no good.’</p>
     <p>‘’Tis not for that, Stephen, that I mind.  But thou know’st our old agreement.  ’Tis for
      that.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, well,’ said he.  ‘’Tis better, onnyways.’</p>
     <p>‘Thou’lt write to me, and tell me all that happens, Stephen?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes.  What can I say now, but Heaven be wi’ thee, Heaven bless thee, Heaven thank thee and
      reward thee!’</p>
     <p>‘May it bless thee, Stephen, too, in all thy wanderings, and send thee peace and rest at
      last!’</p>
     <p>‘I towd thee, my dear,’ said Stephen Blackpool — ‘that night — that I would never see or
      think o’ onnything that angered me, but thou, so much better than me, should’st be beside it. 
      Thou’rt beside it now.  Thou mak’st me see it wi’ a better eye.  Bless thee.  Good night. 
      Good-bye!’</p>
     <p>It was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet it was a sacred remembrance to these
      two common people.  Utilitarian economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact,
      genteel and used-up infidels, gabblers of many little dog’s-eared creeds, the poor you will
      have always with you.  Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the utmost graces of the
      fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament; or, in the day of
      your triumph, when romance is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare existence
      stand face to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you.</p>
     <p>Stephen worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word from any one, and shunned in
      all his comings and goings as before.  At the end of the second day, he saw land; at the end
      of the third, his loom stood empty.</p>
     <p>He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank, on each of the two first
      evenings; and nothing had happened there, good or bad.  That he might not be remiss in his
      part of the engagement, he resolved to wait full two hours, on this third and last night.</p>
     <p>There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby’s house, sitting at the first-floor
      window as he had seen her before; and there was the light porter, sometimes talking with her
      there, and sometimes looking over the blind below which had <hi>Bank</hi> upon it, and
      sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air.  When he first
      came out, Stephen thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the light porter
      only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said nothing.</p>
     <p>Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day’s labour.  Stephen sat
      upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled up and down,
      listened for the church clock, stopped and watched children playing in the street.  Some
      purpose or other is so natural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels
      remarkable.  When the first hour was out, Stephen even began to have an uncomfortable
      sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable character.</p>
     <p>Then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down the long perspective
      of the street, until they were blended and lost in the distance.  Mrs. Sparsit closed the
      first-floor window, drew down the blind, and went up-stairs.  Presently, a light went
      up-stairs after her, passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase
      windows, on its way up.  By and by, one corner of the second-floor blind was disturbed, as if
      Mrs. Sparsit’s eye were there; also the other corner, as if the light porter’s eye were on
      that side.  Still, no communication was made to Stephen.  Much relieved when the two hours
      were at last accomplished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for so much
      loitering.</p>
     <p>He had only to take leave of his landlady, and lie down on his temporary bed upon the floor;
      for his bundle was made up for to-morrow, and all was arranged for his departure.  He meant to
      be clear of the town very early; before the Hands were in the streets.</p>
     <p>It was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his room, mournfully wondering
      whether he should ever see it again, he went out.  The town was as entirely deserted as if the
      inhabitants had abandoned it, rather than hold communication with him.  Everything looked wan
      at that hour.  Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky, like a sad sea.</p>
     <p>By the place where Rachael lived, though it was not in his way; by the red brick streets; by
      the great silent factories, not trembling yet; by the railway, where the danger-lights were
      waning in the strengthening day; by the railway’s crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and
      half built up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled
      with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by coal-dust paths and many varieties of
      ugliness; Stephen got to the top of the hill, and looked back.</p>
     <p>Day was shining radiantly upon the town then, and the bells were going for the morning
      work.  Domestic fires were not yet lighted, and the high chimneys had the sky to themselves. 
      Puffing out their poisonous volumes, they would not be long in hiding it; but, for half an
      hour, some of the many windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun eternally
      in eclipse, through a medium of smoked glass.</p>
     <p>So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.  So strange,
      <pb n=" 126"/>to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit.  So strange to have
      lived to his time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning!  With these
      musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm, Stephen took his attentive face along the
      high road.  And the trees arched over him, whispering that he left a true and loving heart
      behind.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER VII GUNPOWDER</head>
     <p>Mr. James Harthouse, ‘going in’ for his adopted party, soon began to score.  With
      the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a little more genteel listlessness
      for the general society, and a tolerable management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most
      effective and most patronized of the polite deadly sins, he speedily came to be considered of
      much promise.  The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand point in his favour,
      enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with as good a grace as if he had been born one
      of the tribe, and to throw all other tribes overboard, as conscious hypocrites.</p>
     <p>‘Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby, and who do not believe themselves.  The
      only difference between us and the professors of virtue or benevolence, or philanthropy —
      never mind the name — is, that we know it is all meaningless, and say so; while they know it
      equally and will never say so.’</p>
     <p>Why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?  It was not so unlike her father’s
      principles, and her early training, that it need startle her.  Where was the great difference
      between the two schools, when each chained her down to material realities, and inspired her
      with no faith in anything else?  What was there in her soul for James Harthouse to destroy,
      which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state of innocence!</p>
     <p>It was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her mind — implanted there before her
      eminently practical father began to form it — a struggling disposition to believe in a wider
      and nobler humanity than she had ever heard of, constantly strove with doubts and
      resentments.  With doubts, because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth.  With
      resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were indeed a whisper of the
      truth.  Upon a nature long accustomed to self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the
      Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification.  Everything being hollow and
      worthless, she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing.  What did it matter, she had said to
      her father, when he proposed her husband.  What did it matter, she said still.  With a
      scornful self-reliance, she asked herself, What did anything matter — and went on.</p>
     <p>Towards what?  Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet so gradually, that
      she believed herself to remain motionless.  As to Mr. Harthouse, whither <hi>he</hi> tended,
      he neither considered nor cared.  He had no particular design or plan before him: no energetic
      wickedness ruffled his lassitude.  He was as much amused and interested, at present, as it
      became so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have been consistent with
      his reputation to confess.  Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother, the
      honourable and jocular member, that the Bounderbys were ‘great fun;’ and further, that the
      female Bounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was young, and remarkably
      pretty.  After that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted his leisure chiefly to their
      house.  He was very often in their house, in his flittings and visitings about the Coketown
      district; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby.  It was quite in Mr. Bounderby’s gusty way
      to boast to all his world that <hi>he</hi> didn’t care about your highly connected people, but
      that if his wife Tom Gradgrind’s daughter did, she was welcome to their company.</p>
     <p>Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the face which changed so
      beautifully for the whelp, would change for him.</p>
     <p>He was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget a word of the
      brother’s revelations.  He interwove them with everything he saw of the sister, and he began
      to understand her.  To be sure, the better and profounder part of her character was not within
      his scope of perception; for in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he soon
      began to read the rest with a student’s eye.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen miles from the
      town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway striding on many arches over a wild
      country, undermined by deserted coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of
      stationary engines at pits’ mouths.  This country, gradually softening towards the
      neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby’s retreat, there mellowed into a rustic landscape, golden with
      heath, and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of the year, and tremulous with leaves and their
      shadows all the summer time.  The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus
      pleasantly situated, by one of the Coketown magnates, who, in his determination to make a
      shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune, overspeculated himself by about two hundred
      thousand pounds.  These accidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of
      Coketown, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the improvident classes.</p>
     <p>It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this snug little estate,
      and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in the flower-garden.  He delighted to live,
      barrack-fashion, among the elegant furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his
      origin.  ‘Why, sir,’ he would say to a visitor, ‘I am told that Nickits,’ the late owner,
      ‘gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach.  Now, to be plain with you, if I ever, in the
      whole course of my life, take seven looks at it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much
      as I shall do.  No, by George!  I don’t forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  For
      years upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that I could have got into my
      possession, by any means, unless I stole ’em, were the engravings of a man shaving himself in
      a boot, on the blacking bottles that I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that I
      sold when they were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!’</p>
     <p>Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style.</p>
     <p>‘Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.  Bring half a dozen more if you like, and
      we’ll find room for ’em.  There’s stabling in this place for a dozen horses; and unless
      Nickits is belied, he kept the full number.  A round dozen of ’em, sir.  When that man was a
      boy, he went to Westminster School.  Went to Westminster School as a King’s Scholar, when I
      was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets.  Why, if I wanted to keep a
      dozen horses — which I don’t, for one’s enough for me — I couldn’t bear to see ’em in their
      stalls here, and think what my own lodging used to be.  I couldn’t look at ’em, sir, and not
      order ’em out.  Yet so things come round.  You see this place; you know what sort of a place
      it is; you are aware that there’s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or
      elsewhere — I don’t care where — and here, got into the middle of it, like a maggot into a
      nut, is Josiah Bounderby.  While Nickits (as a man came into my office, and told me
      yesterday), Nickits, who used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays, with the
      chief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face,
      is drivelling at this minute — drivelling, sir! — in a fifth floor, up a narrow dark back
      street in Antwerp.’</p>
     <p>It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long sultry summer days, that Mr.
      Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him wondering when he first saw it, and to try
      if it would change for him.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you alone here.  I have
      for some time had a particular wish to speak to you.’</p>
     <p>It was not by any wonderful accident that he found her, the time of day being that at which
      she was always alone, and the place being her favourite resort.  It was an opening in a dark
      wood, where some felled trees lay, and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves of last
      year, as she had watched the falling ashes at home.</p>
     <p>He sat down beside her, with a glance at her face.</p>
     <p>‘Your brother.  My young friend Tom — ’</p>
     <p>Her colour brightened, and she turned to him with a look of interest.  ‘I never in my life,’
      he thought, ‘saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the lighting of those
      features!’  His face betrayed his thoughts — perhaps without betraying him, for it might have
      been according to its instructions so to do.</p>
     <p>‘Pardon me.  The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful — Tom should be so
      proud of it — I know this is inexcusable, but I am so compelled to admire.’</p>
     <p>‘Being so impulsive,’ she said composedly.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby, no: you know I make no pretence with you.  You know I am a sordid piece of
      human nature, ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum, and altogether
      incapable of any Arcadian proceeding whatever.’</p>
     <p>‘I am waiting,’ she returned, ‘for your further reference to my brother.’</p>
     <p>‘You are rigid with me, and I deserve it.  I am as worthless a dog as you will find, except
      that I am not false — not false.  But you surprised and started me from my subject, which was
      your brother.  I have an interest in him.’</p>
     <p>‘Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?’ she asked, half incredulously and half
      gratefully.</p>
     <p>‘If you had asked me when I first came here, I should have said no.  I must say now — even
      at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity —
      yes.’</p>
     <p>She made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak, but could not find voice; at
      length she said, ‘Mr. Harthouse, I give you credit for being interested in my brother.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you.  I claim to deserve it.  You know how little I do claim, but I will go that
      length.  You have done so much for him, you are so fond of him; your whole life, Mrs.
      Bounderby, expresses such charming self-forgetfulness on his account — pardon me again — I am
      running wide of the subject.  I am interested in him for his own sake.’</p>
     <p>She had made the slightest action possible, as if she would have risen in a hurry and gone
      away.  He had turned the course of what he said at that instant, and she remained.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ he resumed, in a lighter manner, and yet with a show of effort in assuming
      it, which was even more expressive than the manner he dismissed; ‘it is no irrevocable offence
      in a young fellow of your brother’s years, if he is heedless, inconsiderate, and expensive — a
      little dissipated, in the common phrase.  Is he?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘Allow me to be frank.  Do you think he games at all?’</p>
     <p>‘I think he makes bets.’  Mr. Harthouse waiting, as if that were not her whole answer, she
      added, ‘I know he does.’</p>
     <p>‘Of course he loses?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘Everybody does lose who bets.  May I hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying
      him with money for these purposes?’</p>
     <p>She sat, looking down; but, at this question, raised her eyes searchingly and a little
      resentfully.</p>
     <p>‘Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby.  I think Tom may be gradually
      falling into trouble, and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my
      wicked experience. — Shall I say again, for his sake?  Is that necessary?’</p>
     <p>She seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.</p>
     <p>‘Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me,’ said James Harthouse, again
      gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more airy manner; ‘I will confide to you
      my doubt whether he has had many advantages.  Whether — forgive my plainness — whether any
      great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most
      worthy father.’</p>
     <p>‘I do not,’ said Louisa, flushing with her own great remembrance in that wise, ‘think it
      likely.’</p>
     <p>‘Or, between himself, and — I may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning, I am
      sure — and his highly esteemed brother-in-law.’</p>
     <p>She flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she replied in a fainter voice, ‘I
      do not think that likely, either.’</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ said Harthouse, after a short silence, ‘may there be a better confidence
      between yourself and me?  Tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you?’</p>
     <p>‘You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,’ she returned, after some indecision: she had been more
      or less uncertain, and troubled throughout the conversation, and yet had in the main preserved
      her self-contained manner; ‘you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know, it
      is not by way of complaint or regret.  I would never complain of anything, and what I have
      done I do not in the least regret.’</p>
     <p>‘So spirited, too!’ thought James Harthouse.</p>
     <p>‘When I married, I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt.  Heavily for
      him, I mean.  Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets.  They were no sacrifice.  I
      sold them very willingly.  I attached no value to them.  They, were quite worthless to
      me.’</p>
     <p>Either she saw in his face that he knew, or she only feared in her conscience that he knew,
      that she spoke of some of her husband’s gifts.  She stopped, and reddened again.  If he had
      not known it before, he would have known it then, though he had been a much duller man than he
      was.</p>
     <p>‘Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I could spare: in short,
      what money I have had.  Confiding in you at all, on the faith of the interest you profess for
      him, I will not do so by halves.  Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he has
      wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds.  I have not been able to give it to him.  I
      have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved, but I have kept these secrets
      until now, when I trust them to your honour.  I have held no confidence with any one, because
      — you anticipated my reason just now.’  She abruptly broke off.</p>
     <p>He was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an opportunity here of presenting her own image
      to her, slightly disguised as her brother.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world worldly, I feel the utmost
      interest, I assure you, in what you tell me.  I cannot possibly be hard upon your brother.  I
      understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors.  With all
      possible respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive that he has
      not been fortunate in his training.  Bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he
      has his part to play, he rushes into these extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that
      have long been forced — with the very best intentions we have no doubt — upon him.  Mr.
      Bounderby’s fine bluff English independence, though a most charming characteristic, does not —
      as we have agreed — invite confidence.  If I might venture to remark that it is the least in
      the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken, a character misconceived, and
      abilities misdirected, would turn for relief and guidance, I should express what it presents
      to my own view.’</p>
     <p>As she sat looking straight before her, across the changing lights upon the grass into the
      darkness of the wood beyond, he saw in her face her application of his very distinctly uttered
      words.</p>
     <p>‘All allowance,’ he continued, ‘must be made.  I have one great fault to find with Tom,
      however, which I cannot forgive, and for which I take him heavily to account.’</p>
     <p>Louisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?</p>
     <p>‘Perhaps,’ he returned, ‘I have said enough.  Perhaps it would have been better, on the
      whole, if no allusion to it had escaped me.’</p>
     <p>‘You alarm me, Mr. Harthouse.  Pray let me know it.’</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 132"/>‘To relieve you from needless apprehension — and as this confidence regarding
      your brother, which I prize I am sure above all possible things, has been established between
      us — I obey.  I cannot forgive him for not being more sensible in every word, look, and act of
      his life, of the affection of his best friend; of the devotion of his best friend; of her
      unselfishness; of her sacrifice.  The return he makes her, within my observation, is a very
      poor one.  What she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude, not his
      ill-humour and caprice.  Careless fellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as
      to be regardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider it a venial
      offence.’</p>
     <p>The wood floated before her, for her eyes were suffused with tears.  They rose from a deep
      well, long concealed, and her heart was filled with acute pain that found no relief in
      them.</p>
     <p>‘In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs. Bounderby, that I must aspire.  My
      better knowledge of his circumstances, and my direction and advice in extricating them —
      rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale — will give me
      some influence over him, and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.  I have said
      enough, and more than enough.  I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of good fellow, when,
      upon my honour, I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect, and
      openly announce that I am nothing of the sort.  Yonder, among the trees,’ he added, having
      lifted up his eyes and looked about; for he had watched her closely until now; ‘is your
      brother himself; no doubt, just come down.  As he seems to be loitering in this direction, it
      may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards him, and throw ourselves in his way.  He has been
      very silent and doleful of late.  Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched — if there are
      such things as consciences.  Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe
      in them.’</p>
     <p>He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet the whelp.  He was
      idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from
      the trees with his stick.  He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in
      this latter pastime, and his colour changed.</p>
     <p>‘Halloa!’ he stammered; ‘I didn’t know you were here.’</p>
     <p>‘Whose name, Tom,’ said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him,
      so that they all three walked towards the house together, ‘have you been carving on the
      trees?’</p>
     <p>‘Whose name?’ returned Tom.  ‘Oh!  You mean what girl’s name?’</p>
     <p>‘You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature’s on the bark, Tom.’</p>
     <p/>
     <p>‘Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her
      own disposal would take a fancy to me.  Or she might be as ugly as she was rich, without any
      fear of losing me.  I’d carve her name as often as she liked.’</p>
     <p>‘I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.’</p>
     <p>‘Mercenary,’ repeated Tom.  ‘Who is not mercenary?  Ask my sister.’</p>
     <p>‘Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?’ said Louisa, showing no other sense of
      his discontent and ill-nature.</p>
     <p>‘You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,’ returned her brother sulkily.  ‘If it does, you
      can wear it.’</p>
     <p>‘Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,’ said Mr. Harthouse. 
      ‘Don’t believe him, Mrs. Bounderby.  He knows much better.  I shall disclose some of his
      opinions of you, privately expressed to me, unless he relents a little.’</p>
     <p>‘At all events, Mr. Harthouse,’ said Tom, softening in his admiration of his patron, but
      shaking his head sullenly too, ‘you can’t tell her that I ever praised her for being
      mercenary.  I may have praised her for being the contrary, and I should do it again, if I had
      as good reason.  However, never mind this now; it’s not very interesting to you, and I am sick
      of the subject.’</p>
     <p>They walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted her visitor’s arm and went in.  He stood
      looking after her, as she ascended the steps, and passed into the shadow of the door; then put
      his hand upon her brother’s shoulder again, and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk
      in the garden.</p>
     <p>‘Tom, my fine fellow, I want to have a word with you.’</p>
     <p>They had stopped among a disorder of roses — it was part of Mr. Bounderby’s humility to keep
      Nickits’s roses on a reduced scale — and Tom sat down on a terrace-parapet, plucking buds and
      picking them to pieces; while his powerful Familiar stood over him, with a foot upon the
      parapet, and his figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee.  They were just
      visible from her window.  Perhaps she saw them.</p>
     <p>‘Tom, what’s the matter?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!  Mr. Harthouse,’ said Tom with a groan, ‘I am hard up, and bothered out of my
      life.’</p>
     <p>‘My good fellow, so am I.’</p>
     <p>‘You!’ returned Tom.  ‘You are the picture of independence.  Mr. Harthouse, I am in a
      horrible mess.  You have no idea what a state I have got myself into — what a state my sister
      might have got me out of, if she would only have done it.’</p>
     <p>He took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his teeth with a hand that
      trembled like an infirm old man’s.  After one exceedingly observant look at him, his companion
      relapsed into his lightest air.</p>
     <p>‘Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister.  You have had money of her,
      you dog, you know you have.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have.  How else was I to get it?  Here’s old Bounderby always
      boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month, or something of that sort.  Here’s my
      father drawing what he calls a line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels. 
      Here’s my mother who never has anything of her own, except her complaints.  What <hi>is</hi> a
      fellow to do for money, and where <hi>am</hi> I to look for it, if not to my sister?’</p>
     <p>He was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by dozens.  Mr. Harthouse took him
      persuasively by the coat.</p>
     <p>‘But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it — ’</p>
     <p>‘Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?  I don’t say she has got it.  I may have wanted more than she
      was likely to have got.  But then she ought to get it.  She could get it.  It’s of no use
      pretending to make a secret of matters now, after what I have told you already; you know she
      didn’t marry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his sake, but for my sake.  Then why
      doesn’t she get what I want, out of him, for my sake?  She is not obliged to say what she is
      going to do with it; she is sharp enough; she could manage to coax it out of him, if she
      chose.  Then why doesn’t she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?  But no. 
      There she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it
      easily.  I don’t know what you may call this, but I call it unnatural conduct.’</p>
     <p>There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on the other side, into
      which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior,
      as the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic.  But he
      preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the
      accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little surface-island.</p>
     <p>‘My dear Tom,’ said Harthouse, ‘let me try to be your banker.’</p>
     <p>‘For God’s sake,’ replied Tom, suddenly, ‘don’t talk about bankers!’  And very white he
      looked, in contrast with the roses.  Very white.</p>
     <p>Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best society, was not to be
      surprised — he could as soon have been affected — but he raised his eyelids a little more, as
      if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder.  Albeit it was as much against the precepts
      of his school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College.</p>
     <p>‘What is the present need, Tom?  Three figures?  Out with them.  Say what they are.’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Harthouse,’ returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were better than his
      injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: ‘it’s too late; the money is of no use to me at
      present.  I should have had it before to be of use to me.  But I am very much obliged to you;
      you’re a true friend.’</p>
     <p>A true friend!  ‘Whelp, whelp!’ thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; ‘what an Ass you are!’</p>
     <p>‘And I take your offer as a great kindness,’ said Tom, grasping his hand.  ‘As a great
      kindness, Mr. Harthouse.’</p>
     <p>‘Well,’ returned the other, ‘it may be of more use by and by.  And, my good fellow, if you
      will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways
      out of them than you can find for yourself.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you,’ said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds.  ‘I wish I had known
      you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.’</p>
     <p>‘Now, you see, Tom,’ said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two,
      as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to
      become a part of the mainland: ‘every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly
      like the rest of my fellow-creatures.  I am desperately intent;’ the languor of his
      desperation being quite tropical; ‘on your softening towards your sister — which you ought to
      do; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother — which you ought to
      be.’</p>
     <p>‘I will be, Mr. Harthouse.’</p>
     <p>‘No time like the present, Tom.  Begin at once.’</p>
     <p>‘Certainly I will.  And my sister Loo shall say so.’</p>
     <p>‘Having made which bargain, Tom,’ said Harthouse, clapping him on the shoulder again, with
      an air which left him at liberty to infer — as he did, poor fool — that this condition was
      imposed upon him in mere careless good nature to lessen his sense of obligation, ‘we will tear
      ourselves asunder until dinner-time.’</p>
     <p>When Tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy enough, his body was on the
      alert; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in.  ‘I didn’t mean to be cross, Loo,’ he
      said, giving her his hand, and kissing her.  ‘I know you are fond of me, and you know I am
      fond of you.’</p>
     <p>After this, there was a smile upon Louisa’s face that day, for some one else.  Alas, for
      some one else!</p>
     <p>‘So much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for,’ thought James
      Harthouse, reversing the reflection of his first day’s knowledge of her pretty face.  ‘So much
      the less, so much the less.’</p>

     <head>CHAPTER VIII EXPLOSION</head>
     <p>The next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and James Harthouse rose
      early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room, smoking the rare tobacco that
      had had so wholesome an influence on his young friend.  Reposing in the sunlight, with the
      fragrance of his eastern pipe about him, and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air, so rich
      and soft with summer odours, he reckoned up his advantages as an idle winner might count his
      gains.  He was not at all bored for the time, and could give his mind to it.</p>
     <p>He had established a confidence with her, from which her husband was excluded.  He had
      established a confidence with her, that absolutely turned upon her indifference towards her
      husband, and the absence, now and at all times, of any congeniality between them.  He had
      artfully, but plainly, assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate recesses;
      he had come so near to her through its tenderest sentiment; he had associated himself with
      that feeling; and the barrier behind which she lived, had melted away.  All very odd, and very
      satisfactory!</p>
     <p>And yet he had not, even now, any earnest wickedness of purpose in him.  Publicly and
      privately, it were much better for the age in which he lived, that he and the legion of whom
      he was one were designedly bad, than indifferent and purposeless.  It is the drifting icebergs
      setting with any current anywhere, that wreck the ships.</p>
     <p>When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about in a shape by which few but
      savages and hunters are attracted.  But, when he is trimmed, smoothed, and varnished,
      according to the mode; when he is aweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to
      brimstone, and used up as to bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or
      to the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil.</p>
     <p>So James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and reckoning up the steps he
      had taken on the road by which he happened to be travelling.  The end to which it led was
      before him, pretty plainly; but he troubled himself with no calculations about it.  What will
      be, will be.</p>
     <p>As he had rather a long ride to take that day — for there was a public occasion ‘to do’ at
      some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity of going in for the Gradgrind men — he
      dressed early and went down to breakfast.  He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the
      previous evening.  No.  He resumed where he had left off.  There was a look of interest for
      him again.</p>
     <p>He got through the day as much (or as little) to his own satisfaction, as was to be expected
      under the fatiguing circumstances; and came riding back at six o’clock.  There was a sweep of
      some half-mile between the lodge and the house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over
      the smooth gravel, once Nickits’s, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shrubbery, with such
      violence as to make his horse shy across the road.</p>
     <p>‘Harthouse!’ cried Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Have you heard?’</p>
     <p>‘Heard what?’ said Harthouse, soothing his horse, and inwardly favouring Mr. Bounderby with
      no good wishes.</p>
     <p>‘Then you <hi>haven’t</hi> heard!’</p>
     <p>‘I have heard you, and so has this brute.  I have heard nothing else.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of the path before the horse’s
      head, to explode his bombshell with more effect.</p>
     <p>‘The Bank’s robbed!’</p>
     <p>‘You don’t mean it!’</p>
     <p>‘Robbed last night, sir.  Robbed in an extraordinary manner.  Robbed with a false key.’</p>
     <p>‘Of much?’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it, really seemed mortified by being
      obliged to reply, ‘Why, no; not of very much.  But it might have been.’</p>
     <p>‘Of how much?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh! as a sum — if you stick to a sum — of not more than a hundred and fifty pound,’ said
      Bounderby, with impatience.  ‘But it’s not the sum; it’s the fact.  It’s the fact of the Bank
      being robbed, that’s the important circumstance.  I am surprised you don’t see it.’</p>
     <p>‘My dear Bounderby,’ said James, dismounting, and giving his bridle to his servant, ‘I
       <hi>do</hi> see it; and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be, by the spectacle
      afforded to my mental view.  Nevertheless, I may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you —
      which I do with all my soul, I assure you — on your not having sustained a greater loss.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank’ee,’ replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner.  ‘But I tell you what.  It
      might have been twenty thousand pound.’</p>
     <p>‘I suppose it might.’</p>
     <p>‘Suppose it might!  By the Lord, you <hi>may</hi> suppose so.  By George!’ said Mr.
      Bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  ‘It might have been twice
      twenty.  There’s no knowing what it would have been, or wouldn’t have been, as it was, but for
      the fellows’ being disturbed.’</p>
     <p>Louisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit, and Bitzer.</p>
     <p>‘Here’s Tom Gradgrind’s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been, if you don’t,’
      blustered Bounderby.  ‘Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her!  Never knew her do
      such a thing before.  Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!’</p>
     <p>She still looked faint and pale.  James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they
      moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed.</p>
     <p>‘Why, I am going to tell you,’ said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. 
      ‘If you hadn’t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you
      before.  You know this lady (for she <hi>is</hi> a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?’</p>
     <p>‘I have already had the honour — ’</p>
     <p>‘Very well.  And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same occasion?’  Mr.
      Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead.</p>
     <p>‘Very well.  They live at the Bank.  You know they live at the Bank, perhaps?  Very well. 
      Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual.  In the
      iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.  In the
      little safe in young Tom’s closet, the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred and
      fifty odd pound.’</p>
     <p>‘A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,’ said Bitzer.</p>
     <p>‘Come!’ retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, ‘let’s have none of
       <hi>your</hi> interruptions.  It’s enough to be robbed while you’re snoring because you’re
      too comfortable, without being put right with <hi>your</hi> four seven ones.  I didn’t snore,
      myself, when I was your age, let me tell you.  I hadn’t victuals enough to snore.  And I
      didn’t four seven one.  Not if I knew it.’</p>
     <p>Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at once particularly
      impressed and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Bounderby’s moral abstinence.</p>
     <p>‘A hundred and fifty odd pound,’ resumed Mr. Bounderby.  ‘That sum of money, young Tom
      locked in his safe, not a very strong safe, but that’s no matter now.  Everything was left,
      all right.  Some time in the night, while this young fellow snored — Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am, you
      say you have heard him snore?’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I cannot say that I have heard him precisely snore, and
      therefore must not make that statement.  But on winter evenings, when he has fallen asleep at
      his table, I have heard him, what I should prefer to describe as partially choke.  I have
      heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard
      in Dutch clocks.  Not,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty sense of giving strict evidence, ‘that
      I would convey any imputation on his moral character.  Far from it.  I have always considered
      Bitzer a young man of the most upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my testimony.’</p>
     <p>‘Well!’ said the exasperated Bounderby, ‘while he was snoring, <hi>or</hi> choking,
       <hi>or</hi> Dutch-clocking, <hi>or</hi> something <hi>or</hi> other — being asleep — some
      fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen, got to
      young Tom’s safe, forced it, and abstracted the contents.  Being then disturbed, they made
      off; letting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was
      double-locked, and the key under Mrs. Sparsit’s pillow) with a false key, which was picked up
      in the street near the Bank, about twelve o’clock to-day.  No alarm takes place, till this
      chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices for
      business.  Then, looking at Tom’s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and
      the money gone.’</p>
     <p>‘Where is Tom, by the by?’ asked Harthouse, glancing round.</p>
     <p>‘He has been helping the police,’ said Bounderby, ‘and stays behind at the Bank.  I wish
      these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life.  They would have been out of
      pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job; I can tell ’em that.’</p>
     <p>‘Is anybody suspected?’</p>
     <p>‘Suspected?  I should think there was somebody suspected.  Egod!’ said Bounderby,
      relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit’s arm to wipe his heated head.  ‘Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is
      not to be plundered and nobody suspected.  No, thank you!’</p>
     <p>Might Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected?</p>
     <p>‘Well,’ said Bounderby, stopping and facing about to confront them all, ‘I’ll tell you. 
      It’s not to be mentioned everywhere; it’s not to be mentioned anywhere: in order that the
      scoundrels concerned (there’s a gang of ’em) may be thrown off their guard.  So take this in
      confidence.  Now wait a bit.’  Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again.  ‘What should you say to;’
      here he violently exploded: ‘to a Hand being in it?’</p>
     <p>‘I hope,’ said Harthouse, lazily, ‘not our friend Blackpot?’</p>
     <p>‘Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,’ returned Bounderby, ‘and that’s the man.’</p>
     <p>Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise.</p>
     <p>‘O yes!  I know!’ said Bounderby, immediately catching at the sound.  ‘I know!  I am used to
      that.  I know all about it.  They are the finest people in the world, these fellows are.  They
      have got the gift of the gab, they have.  They only want to have their rights explained to
      them, they do.  But I tell you what.  Show me a dissatisfied Hand, and I’ll show you a man
      that’s fit for anything bad, I don’t care what it is.’</p>
     <p>Another of the popular fictions of Coketown, which some pains had been taken to disseminate
      — and which some people really believed.</p>
     <p>‘But I am acquainted with these chaps,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I can read ’em off, like books. 
      Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am, I appeal to you.  What warning did I give that fellow, the first time he
      set foot in the house, when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock
      Religion over, and floor the Established Church?  Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high connexions,
      you are on a level with the aristocracy, — did I say, or did I not say, to that fellow, “you
      can’t hide the truth from me: you are not the kind of fellow I like; you’ll come to no
      good”?’</p>
     <p>‘Assuredly, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you did, in a highly impressive manner, give him
      such an admonition.’</p>
     <p>‘When he shocked you, ma’am,’ said Bounderby; ‘when he shocked your feelings?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a meek shake of her head, ‘he certainly did so. 
      Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points — more foolish
      if the term is preferred — than they might have been, if I had always occupied my present
      position.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as to say, ‘I am the
      proprietor of this female, and she’s worth your attention, I think.’  Then, resumed his
      discourse.</p>
     <p>‘You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him when you saw him.  I didn’t
      mince the matter with him.  I am never mealy with ’em.  I <hi>KNOW</hi> ’em.  Very well, sir. 
      Three days after that, he bolted.  Went off, nobody knows where: as my mother did in my
      infancy — only with this difference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible. 
      What did he do before he went?  What do you say;’ Mr. Bounderby, with his hat in his hand,
      gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences, as if it were a
      tambourine; ‘to his being seen — night after night — watching the Bank? — to his lurking about
      there — after dark? — To its striking Mrs. Sparsit — that he could be lurking for no good — To
      her calling Bitzer’s attention to him, and their both taking notice of him — And to its
      appearing on inquiry to-day — that he was also noticed by the neighbours?’  Having come to the
      climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put his tambourine on his head.</p>
     <p>‘Suspicious,’ said James Harthouse, ‘certainly.’</p>
     <p>‘I think so, sir,’ said Bounderby, with a defiant nod.  ‘I think so.  But there are more of
      ’em in it.  There’s an old woman.  One never hears of these things till the mischief’s done;
      all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there’s an
      old woman turns up now.  An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick,
      every now and then.  <hi>She</hi> watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins, and
      on the night when you saw him, she steals away with him and holds a council with him — I
      suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be damned to her.’</p>
     <p>There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from observation, thought
      Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘This is not all of ’em, even as we already know ’em,’ said Bounderby, with many nods of
      hidden meaning.  ‘But I have said enough for the present.  You’ll have the goodness to keep it
      quiet, and mention it to no one.  It may take time, but we shall have ’em.  It’s policy to
      give ’em line enough, and there’s no objection to that.’</p>
     <p>‘Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as notice-boards
      observe,’ replied James Harthouse, ‘and serve them right.  Fellows who go in for Banks must
      take the consequences.  If there were no consequences, we should all go in for Banks.’  He had
      gently taken Louisa’s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked under
      its shade, though the sun did not shine there.</p>
     <p>‘For the present, Loo Bounderby,’ said her husband, ‘here’s Mrs. Sparsit to look after. 
      Mrs. Sparsit’s nerves have been acted upon by this business, and she’ll stay here a day or
      two.  So make her comfortable.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you very much, sir,’ that discreet lady observed, ‘but pray do not let My comfort be
      a consideration.  Anything will do for Me.’</p>
     <p>It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her association with that domestic
      establishment, it was that she was so excessively regardless of herself and regardful of
      others, as to be a nuisance.  On being shown her chamber, she was so dreadfully sensible of
      its comforts as to suggest the inference that she would have preferred to pass the night on
      the mangle in the laundry.  True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses were accustomed to splendour,
      ‘but it is my duty to remember,’ Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace:
      particularly when any of the domestics were present, ‘that what I was, I am no longer. 
      Indeed,’ said she, ‘if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr. Sparsit was a
      Powler, or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family; or if I could even revoke the
      fact, and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions; I would gladly do
      so.  I should think it, under existing circumstances, right to do so.’  The same Hermitical
      state of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner, until fairly
      commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she said, ‘Indeed you are very good, sir;’ and
      departed from a resolution of which she had made rather formal and public announcement, to
      ‘wait for the simple mutton.’  She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt; and,
      feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest extent in the testimony he had
      borne to her nerves, occasionally sat back in her chair and silently wept; at which periods a
      tear of large dimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed (or rather, must be, for
      it insisted on public notice) sliding down her Roman nose.</p>
     <p>But Mrs. Sparsit’s greatest point, first and last, was her determination to pity Mr.
      Bounderby.  There were occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to shake
      her head, as who would say, ‘Alas, poor Yorick!’  After allowing herself to be betrayed into
      these evidences of emotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully
      cheerful, and would say, ‘You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful to find;’ and would
      appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did.  One
      idiosyncrasy for which she often apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer. 
      She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ‘Miss Gradgrind,’ and yielded to it some
      three or four score times in the course of the evening.  Her repetition of this mistake
      covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion; but indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say
      Miss Gradgrind: whereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the
      happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs. Bounderby, she found almost
      impossible.  It was a further singularity of this remarkable case, that the more she thought
      about it, the more impossible it appeared; ‘the differences,’ she observed, ‘being such.’</p>
     <p>In the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the robbery, examined the
      witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them
      to the extreme punishment of the law.  That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with
      instructions to recommend Tom to come home by the mail-train.</p>
     <p>When candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured, ‘Don’t be low, sir.  Pray let me see you
      cheerful, sir, as I used to do.’  Mr. Bounderby, upon whom these consolations had begun to
      produce the effect of making him, in a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like
      some large sea-animal.  ‘I cannot bear to see you so, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Try a hand at
      backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of living under your roof.’  ‘I
      haven’t played backgammon, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘since that time.’  ‘No, sir,’ said
      Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly, ‘I am aware that you have not.  I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes
      no interest in the game.  But I shall be happy, sir, if you will condescend.’</p>
     <p>They played near a window, opening on the garden.  It was a fine night: not moonlight, but
      sultry and fragrant.  Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the garden, where their
      voices could be heard in the stillness, though not what they said.  Mrs. Sparsit, from her
      place at the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the shadows
      without.  ‘What’s the matter, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bounderby; ‘you don’t see a Fire, do you?’  ‘Oh
      dear no, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I was thinking of the dew.’  ‘What have you got to do
      with the dew, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘It’s not myself, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I
      am fearful of Miss Gradgrind’s taking cold.’  ‘She never takes cold,’ said Mr. Bounderby. 
      ‘Really, sir?’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  And was affected with a cough in her throat.</p>
     <p>When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water.  ‘Oh, sir?’ said
      Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Not your sherry warm, with lemon-peel and nutmeg?’  ‘Why, I have got out of
      the habit of taking it now, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘The more’s the pity, sir,’ returned
      Mrs. Sparsit; ‘you are losing all your good old habits.  Cheer up, sir!  If Miss Gradgrind
      will permit me, I will offer to make it for you, as I have often done.’</p>
     <p>Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she pleased, that considerate
      lady made the beverage, and handed it to Mr. Bounderby.  ‘It will do you good, sir.  It will
      warm your heart.  It is the sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.’  And when Mr.
      Bounderby said, ‘Your health, ma’am!’ she answered with great feeling, ‘Thank you, sir.  The
      same to you, and happiness also.’  Finally, she wished him good night, with great pathos; and
      Mr. Bounderby went to bed, with a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something
      tender, though he could not, for his life, have mentioned what it was.</p>
     <p>Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for her brother’s
      coming home.  That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour past midnight; but in the country
      silence, which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.  At
      last, when the darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she heard
      the bell at the gate.  She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until
      daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the
      air, and all was dead again.</p>
     <p>She waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.  Then she arose, put on a loose robe,
      and went out of her room in the dark, and up the staircase to her brother’s room.  His door
      being shut, she softly opened it and spoke to him, approaching his bed with a noiseless
      step.</p>
     <p>She kneeled down beside it, passed her arm over his neck, and drew his face to hers.  She
      knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said nothing to him.</p>
     <p>He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was
      the matter?</p>
     <p>‘Tom, have you anything to tell me?  If ever you loved me in your life, and have anything
      concealed from every one besides, tell it to me.’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t know what you mean, Loo.  You have been dreaming.’</p>
     <p>‘My dear brother:’ she laid her head down on his pillow, and her hair flowed over him as if
      she would hide him from every one but herself: ‘is there nothing that you have to tell me?  Is
      there nothing you can tell me if you will?  You can tell me nothing that will change me.  O
      Tom, tell me the truth!’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t know what you mean, Loo!’</p>
     <p>‘As you lie here alone, my dear, in the melancholy night, so you must lie somewhere one
      night, when even I, if I am living then, shall have left you.  As I am here beside you,
      barefoot, unclothed, undistinguishable in darkness, so must I lie through all the night of my
      decay, until I am dust.  In the name of that time, Tom, tell me the truth now!’</p>
     <p>‘What is it you want to know?’</p>
     <p>‘You may be certain;’ in the energy of her love she took him to her bosom as if he were a
      child; ‘that I will not reproach you.  You may be certain that I will be compassionate and
      true to you.  You may be certain that I will save you at whatever cost.  O Tom, have you
      nothing to tell me?  Whisper very softly.  Say only “yes,” and I shall understand you!’</p>
     <p>She turned her ear to his lips, but he remained doggedly silent.</p>
     <p>‘Not a word, Tom?’</p>
     <p>‘How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I don’t know what you mean?  Loo, you are a
      brave, kind girl, worthy I begin to think of a better brother than I am.  But I have nothing
      more to say.  Go to bed, go to bed.’</p>
     <p>‘You are tired,’ she whispered presently, more in her usual way.</p>
     <p>‘Yes, I am quite tired out.’</p>
     <p>‘You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day.  Have any fresh discoveries been made?’</p>
     <p>‘Only those you have heard of, from — him.’</p>
     <p>‘Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and that we saw those
      three together?’</p>
     <p>‘No.  Didn’t you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there
      with you?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes.  But I did not know then what was going to happen.’</p>
     <p>‘Nor I neither.  How could I?’</p>
     <p>He was very quick upon her with this retort.</p>
     <p>‘Ought I to say, after what has happened,’ said his sister, standing by the bed — she had
      gradually withdrawn herself and risen, ‘that I made that visit?  Should I say so?  Must I say
      so?’</p>
     <p>‘Good Heavens, Loo,’ returned her brother, ‘you are not in the habit of asking my advice. 
      Say what you like.  If you keep it to yourself, I shall keep it to <hi>my</hi>self.  If you
      disclose it, there’s an end of it.’</p>
     <p>It was too dark for either to see the other’s face; but each seemed very attentive, and to
      consider before speaking.</p>
     <p>‘Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t know.  I don’t see why he shouldn’t be.’</p>
     <p>‘He seemed to me an honest man.’</p>
     <p>‘Another person may seem to you dishonest, and yet not be so.’  There was a pause, for he
      had hesitated and stopped.</p>
     <p>‘In short,’ resumed Tom, as if he had made up his mind, ‘if you come to that, perhaps I was
      so far from being altogether in his favour, that I took him outside the door to tell him
      quietly, that I thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he
      had got from my sister, and that I hoped he would make good use of it.  You remember whether I
      took him out or not.  I say nothing against the man; he may be a very good fellow, for
      anything I know; I hope he is.’</p>
     <p>‘Was he offended by what you said?’</p>
     <p>‘No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough.  Where are you, Loo?’  He sat up in bed
      and kissed her.  ‘Good night, my dear, good night.’</p>
     <p>‘You have nothing more to tell me?’</p>
     <p>‘No.  What should I have?  You wouldn’t have me tell you a lie!’</p>
     <p>‘I wouldn’t have you do that to-night, Tom, of all the nights in your life; many and much
      happier as I hope they will be.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, my dear Loo.  I am so tired, that I am sure I wonder I don’t say anything to get
      to sleep.  Go to bed, go to bed.’</p>
     <p>Kissing her again, he turned round, drew the coverlet over his head, and lay as still as if
      that time had come by which she had adjured him.  She stood for some time at the bedside
      before she slowly moved away.  She stopped at the door, looked back when she had opened it,
      and asked him if he had called her?  But he lay still, and she softly closed the door and
      returned to her room.</p>
     <p>Then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone, crept out of bed, fastened
      his door, and threw himself upon his pillow again: tearing his hair, morosely crying,
      grudgingly loving her, hatefully but impenitently spurning himself, and no less hatefully and
      unprofitably spurning all the good in the world.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER IX HEARING THE LAST OF IT</head>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit, lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in Mr. Bounderby’s
      retreat, kept such a sharp look-out, night and day, under her Coriolanian eyebrows, that her
      eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an iron-bound coast, might have warned all prudent
      mariners from that bold rock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its
      neighbourhood, but for the placidity of her manner.  Although it was hard to believe that her
      retiring for the night could be anything but a form, so severely wide awake were those
      classical eyes of hers, and so impossible did it seem that her rigid nose could yield to any
      relaxing influence, yet her manner of sitting, smoothing her uncomfortable, not to say, gritty
      mittens (they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat-safe), or of ambling to unknown
      places of destination with her foot in her cotton stirrup, was so perfectly serene, that most
      observers would have been constrained to suppose her a dove, embodied by some freak of nature,
      in the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.</p>
     <p>She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house.  How she got from story to
      story was a mystery beyond solution.  A lady so decorous in herself, and so highly connected,
      was not to be suspected of dropping over the banisters or sliding down them, yet her
      extraordinary facility of locomotion suggested the wild idea.  Another noticeable circumstance
      in Mrs. Sparsit was, that she was never hurried.  She would shoot with consummate velocity
      from the roof to the hall, yet would be in full possession of her breath and dignity on the
      moment of her arrival there.  Neither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great
      pace.</p>
     <p>She took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some pleasant conversation with him soon
      after her arrival.  She made him her stately curtsey in the garden, one morning before
      breakfast.</p>
     <p>‘It appears but yesterday, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘that I had the honour of receiving you
      at the Bank, when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby’s
      address.’</p>
     <p>‘An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of Ages,’ said Mr.
      Harthouse, inclining his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all possible airs.</p>
     <p>‘We live in a singular world, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am proud, to have made a remark, similar
      in effect, though not so epigrammatically expressed.’</p>
     <p>‘A singular world, I would say, sir,’ pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after acknowledging the
      compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not altogether so mild in its expression as
      her voice was in its dulcet tones; ‘as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with
      individuals we were quite ignorant of, at another.  I recall, sir, that on that occasion you
      went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss Gradgrind.’</p>
     <p>‘Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves.  I availed myself of your
      obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly
      accurate.  Mrs. Sparsit’s talent for — in fact for anything requiring accuracy — with a
      combination of strength of mind — and Family — is too habitually developed to admit of any
      question.’  He was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took him so long to get
      through, and his mind wandered so much in the course of its execution.</p>
     <p>‘You found Miss Gradgrind — I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it’s very absurd of me
      — as youthful as I described her?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly.</p>
     <p>‘You drew her portrait perfectly,’ said Mr. Harthouse.  ‘Presented her dead image.’</p>
     <p>‘Very engaging, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one
      another.</p>
     <p>‘Highly so.’</p>
     <p>‘It used to be considered,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in
      animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that
      respect.  Ay, and indeed here <hi>is</hi> Mr. Bounderby!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head
      a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else.  ‘How do you find
      yourself this morning, sir?  Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.’</p>
     <p>Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this
      time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit,
      and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward.  So, when Mrs. Sparsit said
      with forced lightness of heart, ‘You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind
      will soon be here to preside at the table,’ Mr. Bounderby replied, ‘If I waited to be taken
      care of by my wife, ma’am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I’ll
      trouble <hi>you</hi> to take charge of the teapot.’  Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her
      old position at table.</p>
     <p>This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  She was so humble withal, that when
      Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under
      existing circumstances, often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby’s breakfast,
      before Mrs. Gradgrind — she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby — she hoped to be
      excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though she trusted to become familiar with
      it by and by — had assumed her present position.  It was only (she observed) because Miss
      Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby’s time was so very precious, and she
      knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment, that she had taken
      the liberty of complying with his request; long as his will had been a law to her.</p>
     <p>‘There!  Stop where you are, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘stop where you are!  Mrs.
      Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.’</p>
     <p>‘Don’t say that, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity, ‘because that is very
      unkind to Mrs. Bounderby.  And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.’</p>
     <p>‘You may set your mind at rest, ma’am. — You can take it very quietly, can’t you, Loo?’ said
      Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife.</p>
     <p>‘Of course.  It is of no moment.  Why should it be of any importance to me?’</p>
     <p>‘Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bounderby,
      swelling with a sense of slight.  ‘You attach too much importance to these things, ma’am.  By
      George, you’ll be corrupted in some of your notions here.  You are old-fashioned, ma’am.  You
      are behind Tom Gradgrind’s children’s time.’</p>
     <p>‘What is the matter with you?’ asked Louisa, coldly surprised.  ‘What has given you
      offence?’</p>
     <p>‘Offence!’ repeated Bounderby.  ‘Do you suppose if there was any offence given me, I
      shouldn’t name it, and request to have it corrected?  I am a straightforward man, I believe. 
      I don’t go beating about for side-winds.’</p>
     <p>‘I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too delicate,’ Louisa
      answered him composedly: ‘I have never made that objection to you, either as a child or as a
      woman.  I don’t understand what you would have.’</p>
     <p>‘Have?’ returned Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Nothing.  Otherwise, don’t you, Loo Bounderby, know
      thoroughly well that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, would have it?’</p>
     <p>She looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with a proud colour in
      her face that was a new change, Mr. Harthouse thought.  ‘You are incomprehensible this
      morning,’ said Louisa.  ‘Pray take no further trouble to explain yourself.  I am not curious
      to know your meaning.  What does it matter?’</p>
     <p>Nothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay on indifferent
      subjects.  But from this day, the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James
      Harthouse more together, and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and
      confidence against him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she
      could not retrace them if she tried.  But whether she ever tried or no, lay hidden in her own
      closed heart.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that, assisting Mr. Bounderby
      to his hat after breakfast, and being then alone with him in the hall, she imprinted a chaste
      kiss upon his hand, murmured ‘My benefactor!’ and retired, overwhelmed with grief.  Yet it is
      an indubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five minutes after he had
      left the house in the self-same hat, the same descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by
      matrimony of the Powlers, shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a contemptuous
      grimace at that work of art, and said ‘Serve you right, you Noodle, and I am glad of it.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone, when Bitzer appeared.  Bitzer had come down by train,
      shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches that bestrode the wild country of past and
      present coal-pits, with an express from Stone Lodge.  It was a hasty note to inform Louisa
      that Mrs. Gradgrind lay very ill.  She had never been well within her daughter’s knowledge;
      but, she had declined within the last few days, had continued sinking all through the night,
      and was now as nearly dead, as her limited capacity of being in any state that implied the
      ghost of an intention to get out of it, allowed.</p>
     <p>Accompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless servitor at Death’s door when Mrs.
      Gradgrind knocked, Louisa rumbled to Coketown, over the coal-pits past and present, and was
      whirled into its smoky jaws.  She dismissed the messenger to his own devices, and rode away to
      her old home.</p>
     <p>She had seldom been there since her marriage.  Her father was usually sifting and sifting at
      his parliamentary cinder-heap in London (without being observed to turn up many precious
      articles among the rubbish), and was still hard at it in the national dust-yard.  Her mother
      had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined upon her
      sofa; young people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for; Sissy she had never softened to again,
      since the night when the stroller’s child had raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby’s
      intended wife.  She had no inducements to go back, and had rarely gone.</p>
     <p>Neither, as she approached her old home now, did any of the best influences of old home
      descend upon her.  The dreams of childhood — its airy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane,
      impossible adornments of the world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good to be
      remembered when outgrown, for then the least among them rises to the stature of a great
      Charity in the heart, suffering little children to come into the midst of it, and to keep with
      their pure hands a garden in the stony ways of this world, wherein it were better for all the
      children of Adam that they should oftener sun themselves, simple and trustful, and not
      worldly-wise — what had she to do with these?  Remembrances of how she had journeyed to the
      little that she knew, by the enchanted roads of what she and millions of innocent creatures
      had hoped and imagined; of how, first coming upon Reason through the tender light of Fancy,
      she had seen it a beneficent god, deferring to gods as great as itself; not a grim Idol, cruel
      and cold, with its victims bound hand to foot, and its big dumb shape set up with a sightless
      stare, never to be moved by anything but so many calculated tons of leverage — what had she to
      do with these?  Her remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up of
      every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out.  The golden waters were not
      there.  They were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are gathered from
      thorns, and figs from thistles.</p>
     <p>She went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house and into her
      mother’s room.  Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the
      family on equal terms.  Sissy was at her mother’s side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or
      twelve years old, was in the room.</p>
     <p>There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest
      child was there.  She reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old
      usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in.  She had positively refused to take
      to her bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it.</p>
     <p>Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the sound of another voice
      addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears, that she might
      have been lying at the bottom of a well.  The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had
      been: which had much to do with it.</p>
     <p>On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at cross-purposes, that she had
      never called him by that name since he married Louisa; that pending her choice of an
      objectionable name, she had called him J; and that she could not at present depart from that
      regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.  Louisa had sat by her for
      some minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she arrived at a clear understanding who it
      was.  She then seemed to come to it all at once.</p>
     <p>‘Well, my dear,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, ‘and I hope you are going on satisfactorily to
      yourself.  It was all your father’s doing.  He set his heart upon it.  And he ought to
      know.’</p>
     <p>‘I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.’</p>
     <p>‘You want to hear of me, my dear?  That’s something new, I am sure, when anybody wants to
      hear of me.  Not at all well, Louisa.  Very faint and giddy.’</p>
     <p>‘Are you in pain, dear mother?’</p>
     <p>‘I think there’s a pain somewhere in the room,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, ‘but I couldn’t
      positively say that I have got it.’</p>
     <p>After this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.  Louisa, holding her hand, could
      feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin thread of life in fluttering
      motion.</p>
     <p>‘You very seldom see your sister,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘She grows like you.  I wish you
      would look at her.  Sissy, bring her here.’</p>
     <p>She was brought, and stood with her hand in her sister’s.  Louisa had observed her with her
      arm round Sissy’s neck, and she felt the difference of this approach.</p>
     <p>‘Do you see the likeness, Louisa?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, mother.  I should think her like me.  But — ’</p>
     <p>‘Eh!  Yes, I always say so,’ Mrs. Gradgrind cried, with unexpected quickness.  ‘And that
      reminds me.  I — I want to speak to you, my dear.  Sissy, my good girl, leave us alone a
      minute.’ Louisa had relinquished the hand: had thought that her sister’s was a better and
      brighter face than hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of
      resentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the gentleness of the other face
      in the room; the sweet face with the trusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made
      it, by the rich dark hair.</p>
     <p>Left alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon her face, like one
      who was floating away upon some great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down
      the stream.  She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her.</p>
     <p>‘You were going to speak to me, mother.’</p>
     <p>‘Eh?  Yes, to be sure, my dear.  You know your father is almost always away now, and
      therefore I must write to him about it.’</p>
     <p>‘About what, mother?  Don’t be troubled.  About what?’</p>
     <p>‘You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any subject, I have
      never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have long left off saying anything.’</p>
     <p>
      <pb n=" 152"/>‘I can hear you, mother.’  But, it was only by dint of bending down to her ear,
      and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved, that she could link such
      faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion.</p>
     <p>‘You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother.  Ologies of all kinds from
      morning to night.  If there is any Ology left, of any description, that has not been worn to
      rags in this house, all I can say is, I hope I shall never hear its name.’</p>
     <p>‘I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.’  This, to keep her from floating
      away.</p>
     <p>‘But there is something — not an Ology at all — that your father has missed, or forgotten,
      Louisa.  I don’t know what it is.  I have often sat with Sissy near me, and thought about it. 
      I shall never get its name now.  But your father may.  It makes me restless.  I want to write
      to him, to find out for God’s sake, what it is.  Give me a pen, give me a pen.’</p>
     <p>Even the power of restlessness was gone, except from the poor head, which could just turn
      from side to side.</p>
     <p>She fancied, however, that her request had been complied with, and that the pen she could
      not have held was in her hand.  It matters little what figures of wonderful no-meaning she
      began to trace upon her wrappers.  The hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that
      had always been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs.
      Gradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth himself in vain, took
      upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and patriarchs.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER X MRS. SPARSIT’S STAIRCASE</head>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit’s nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman made a
      stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby’s retreat, where, notwithstanding her
      anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming consciousness of her altered station, she
      resigned herself with noble fortitude to lodging, as one may say, in clover, and feeding on
      the fat of the land.  During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the Bank,
      Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to
      his face, as is rarely taken on man, and to call his portrait a Noodle to <hi>its</hi> face,
      with the greatest acrimony and contempt.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly
      superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had
      not yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent
      visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to
      do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.  So when her nerves were strung up to
      the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on
      the day before her departure, ‘I tell you what, ma’am; you shall come down here of a Saturday,
      while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.’  To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in
      effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion: ‘To hear is to obey.’</p>
     <p>Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the nature of an
      allegorical fancy, into her head.  Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of
      her impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit’s edge, must have
      given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration.  She erected in her mind a mighty
      Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to
      day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa coming.</p>
     <p>It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit’s life, to look up at her staircase, and to watch
      Louisa coming down.  Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes several steps at one bout,
      sometimes stopping, never turning back.  If she had once turned back, it might have been the
      death of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.</p>
     <p>She had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr. Bounderby issued the
      weekly invitation recorded above.  Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits, and inclined to be
      conversational.</p>
     <p>‘And pray, sir,’ said she, ‘if I may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject
      on which you show reserve — which is indeed hardy in me, for I well know you have a reason for
      everything you do — have you received intelligence respecting the robbery?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, ma’am, no; not yet.  Under the circumstances, I didn’t expect it yet.  Rome wasn’t
      built in a day, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘Very true, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head.</p>
     <p>‘Nor yet in a week, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘No, indeed, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon her.</p>
     <p>‘In a similar manner, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘I can wait, you know.  If Romulus and Remus
      could wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait.  They were better off in their youth than I was,
      however.  They had a she-wolf for a nurse; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother.  She
      didn’t give any milk, ma’am; she gave bruises.  She was a regular Alderney at that.’</p>
     <p>‘Ah!’ Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered.</p>
     <p>‘No, ma’am,’ continued Bounderby, ‘I have not heard anything more about it.  It’s in hand,
      though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business at present — something new for him; he
      hadn’t the schooling <hi>I</hi> had — is helping.  My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it
      seem to blow over.  Do what you like under the rose, but don’t give a sign of what you’re
      about; or half a hundred of ’em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted, out
      of reach for good.  Keep it quiet, and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and
      little, and we shall have ’em.’</p>
     <p>‘Very sagacious indeed, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Very interesting.  The old woman you
      mentioned, sir — ’</p>
     <p>‘The old woman I mentioned, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, cutting the matter short, as it was
      nothing to boast about, ‘is not laid hold of; but, she may take her oath she will be, if that
      is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind.  In the mean time, ma’am, I am of opinion, if
      you ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.’</p>
     <p>The same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her packing operations,
      looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa still descending.</p>
     <p>She sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low; he stood leaning
      over her, as they whispered together, and his face almost touched her hair.  ‘If not quite!’
      said Mrs. Sparsit, straining her hawk’s eyes to the utmost.  Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to
      hear a word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly, otherwise than
      from the expression of their figures; but what they said was this:</p>
     <p>‘You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh, perfectly!’</p>
     <p>‘His face, and his manner, and what he said?’</p>
     <p>‘Perfectly.  And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.  Lengthy and prosy in
      the extreme.  It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I
      assure you I thought at the time, “My good fellow, you are over-doing this!”’</p>
     <p>‘It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.’</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa — as Tom says.’  Which he never did say.  ‘You know no good of the
      fellow?’</p>
     <p>‘No, certainly.’</p>
     <p>‘Nor of any other such person?’</p>
     <p>‘How can I,’ she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he had lately seen,
      ‘when I know nothing of them, men or women?’</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted
      friend, who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow-creatures — for
      excellent they are, I am quite ready to believe, in spite of such little foibles as always
      helping themselves to what they can get hold of.  This fellow talks.  Well; every fellow
      talks.  He professes morality.  Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality.  From the House
      of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality, except among
      our people; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving.  You saw and
      heard the case.  Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed
      friend Mr. Bounderby — who, as we know, is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften
      so tight a hand.  The member of the fluffy classes was injured, exasperated, left the house
      grumbling, met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business,
      went in, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and relieved his mind
      extremely.  Really he would have been an uncommon, instead of a common, fellow, if he had not
      availed himself of such an opportunity.  Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had
      the cleverness.’</p>
     <p>‘I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,’ returned Louisa, after sitting thoughtful
      awhile, ‘to be so ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in my heart by what you
      say.’</p>
     <p>‘I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse.  I have talked it over with my friend Tom
      more than once — of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom — and he is quite
      of my opinion, and I am quite of his.  Will you walk?’</p>
     <p>They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight — she leaning
      on his arm — and she little thought how she was going down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit’s
      staircase.</p>
     <p>Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.  When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and
      disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it would; but, until then, there it was
      to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit’s eyes.  And there Louisa always was, upon it.</p>
     <p>And always gliding down, down, down!</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and there; she saw the
      changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded,
      how and when it cleared; she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no
      touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest.  In the interest of seeing her, ever drawing,
      with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant’s Staircase.</p>
     <p>With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his portrait, Mrs.
      Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent.  Eager to see it
      accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness
      of the harvest of her hopes.  Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs;
      and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at the figure
      coming down.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <pb n=" 156"/>
     <head>CHAPTER XI LOWER AND LOWER</head>
     <p>The figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always verging, like a
      weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife’s decease, made an expedition from London, and buried
      her in a business-like manner.  He then returned with promptitude to the national cinder-heap,
      and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about
      into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends — in fact resumed his
      parliamentary duties.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  Separated from her staircase,
      all the week, by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she yet
      maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother,
      through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything
      animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.  ‘Your foot on the last step, my
      lady,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, with the aid of her
      threatening mitten, ‘and all your art shall never blind me.’</p>
     <p>Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa’s character or the graft of circumstances
      upon it, — her curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs.
      Sparsit.  There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her.  There were times
      when he could not read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a
      greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her.</p>
     <p>So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by
      business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or four days.  It was on a Friday
      that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank, adding: ‘But you’ll go down to-morrow,
      ma’am, all the same.  You’ll go down just as if I was there.  It will make no difference to
      you.’</p>
     <p>‘Pray, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, ‘let me beg you not to say that.  Your
      absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well know.’</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,’ said Mr. Bounderby,
      not displeased.</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Bounderby,’ retorted Mrs. Sparsit, ‘your will is to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might
      be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that it will be quite so
      agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality. 
      But you shall say no more, sir.  I will go, upon your invitation.’</p>
     <p>‘Why, when I invite you to my house, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, opening his eyes, ‘I should
      hope you want no other invitation.’</p>
     <p>‘No, indeed, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I should hope not.  Say no more, sir.  I would,
      sir, I could see you gay again.’</p>
     <p>‘What do you mean, ma’am?’ blustered Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, ‘there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly
      miss.  Be buoyant, sir!’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her
      compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and
      afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all
      the morning.</p>
     <p>‘Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on his journey, and the
      Bank was closing, ‘present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up
      and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?’  Young Mr. Thomas
      being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its
      heels.  ‘Mr. Thomas,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘these plain viands being on table, I thought you
      might be tempted.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank’ee, Mrs. Sparsit,’ said the whelp.  And gloomily fell to.</p>
     <p>‘How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
     <p>‘Oh, he’s all right,’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>‘Where may he be at present?’ Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after
      mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative.</p>
     <p>‘He is shooting in Yorkshire,’ said Tom.  ‘Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church,
      yesterday.’</p>
     <p>‘The kind of gentleman, now,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, ‘whom one might wager to be a good
      shot!’</p>
     <p>‘Crack,’ said Tom.</p>
     <p>He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of
      late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together.  Mrs. Sparsit
      consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined.</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘as indeed he is of most
      people.  May we expect to see him again shortly, Mr. Tom?’</p>
     <p>‘Why, <hi>I</hi> expect to see him to-morrow,’ returned the whelp.</p>
     <p>‘Good news!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly.</p>
     <p>‘I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here,’ said
      Tom, ‘and I am going to dine with him afterwards, I believe.  He is not coming down to the
      country house for a week or so, being due somewhere else.  At least, he says so; but I
      shouldn’t wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.’</p>
     <p>‘Which reminds me!’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Would you remember a message to your sister, Mr.
      Tom, if I was to charge you with one?’</p>
     <p>‘Well?  I’ll try,’ returned the reluctant whelp, ‘if it isn’t a long un.’</p>
     <p>‘It is merely my respectful compliments,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘and I fear I may not trouble
      her with my society this week; being still a little nervous, and better perhaps by my poor
      self.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!  If that’s all,’ observed Tom, ‘it wouldn’t much matter, even if I was to forget it,
      for Loo’s not likely to think of you unless she sees you.’</p>
     <p>Having paid for his entertainment with this agreeable compliment, he relapsed into a hangdog
      silence until there was no more India ale left, when he said, ‘Well, Mrs. Sparsit, I must be
      off!’ and went off.</p>
     <p>Next day, Saturday, Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window all day long looking at the customers
      coming in and out, watching the postmen, keeping an eye on the general traffic of the street,
      revolving many things in her mind, but, above all, keeping her attention on her staircase. 
      The evening come, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quietly out: having her reasons
      for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a passenger would arrive from
      Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep into it round pillars and corners, and out of ladies’
      waiting-room windows, to appearing in its precincts openly.</p>
     <p>Tom was in attendance, and loitered about until the expected train came in.  It brought no
      Mr. Harthouse.  Tom waited until the crowd had dispersed, and the bustle was over; and then
      referred to a posted list of trains, and took counsel with porters.  That done, he strolled
      away idly, stopping in the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat off and
      putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and exhibiting all the symptoms of
      mortal weariness to be expected in one who had still to wait until the next train should come
      in, an hour and forty minutes hence.</p>
     <p>‘This is a device to keep him out of the way,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, starting from the dull
      office window whence she had watched him last.  ‘Harthouse is with his sister now!’</p>
     <p>It was the conception of an inspired moment, and she shot off with her utmost swiftness to
      work it out.  The station for the country house was at the opposite end of the town, the time
      was short, the road not easy; but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so quick
      in darting out of it, producing her money, seizing her ticket, and diving into the train, that
      she was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past and present, as if she had
      been caught up in a cloud and whirled away.</p>
     <p>All the journey, immovable in the air though never left behind; plain to the dark eyes of
      her mind, as the electric wires which ruled a colossal strip of music-paper out of the evening
      sky, were plain to the dark eyes of her body; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase, with the figure
      coming down.  Very near the bottom now.  Upon the brink of the abyss.</p>
     <p>An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs.
      Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a
      stony road, cross it into a green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and
      branches.  One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily crossing
      and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet,
      were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate.</p>
     <p>She went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round it, peeping between
      the leaves at the lower windows.  Most of them were open, as they usually were in such warm
      weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was silent.  She tried the garden with no
      better effect.  She thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and
      briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things that be.  With her dark eyes
      and her hook nose warily in advance of her, Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her way through the
      thick undergrowth, so intent upon her object that she probably would have done no less, if the
      wood had been a wood of adders.</p>
     <p>Hark!</p>
     <p>The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests, fascinated by the glittering of
      Mrs. Sparsit’s eyes in the gloom, as she stopped and listened.</p>
     <p>Low voices close at hand.  His voice and hers.  The appointment <hi>was</hi> a device to
      keep the brother away!  There they were yonder, by the felled tree.</p>
     <p>Bending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them.  She drew herself
      up, and stood behind a tree, like Robinson Crusoe in his ambuscade against the savages; so
      near to them that at a spring, and that no great one, she could have touched them both.  He
      was there secretly, and had not shown himself at the house.  He had come on horseback, and
      must have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his horse was tied to the meadow side of
      the fence, within a few paces.</p>
     <p>‘My dearest love,’ said he, ‘what could I do?  Knowing you were alone, was it possible that
      I could stay away?’</p>
     <p>‘You may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; <hi>I</hi> don’t know what
      they see in you when you hold it up,’ thought Mrs. Sparsit; ‘but you little think, my dearest
      love, whose eyes are on you!’</p>
     <p>That she hung her head, was certain.  She urged him to go away, she commanded him to go
      away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor raised it.  Yet it was remarkable that she
      sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her
      life.  Her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her manner of
      speaking was not hurried.</p>
     <p>‘My dear child,’ said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his arm embraced her;
      ‘will you not bear with my society for a little while?’</p>
     <p>‘Not here.’</p>
     <p>‘Where, Louisa?</p>
     <p>‘Not here.’</p>
     <p>‘But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far, and am altogether so
      devoted, and distracted.  There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill-used by his
      mistress.  To look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in
      your frozen manner, is heart-rending.’</p>
     <p>‘Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself here?’</p>
     <p>‘But we must meet, my dear Louisa.  Where shall we meet?’</p>
     <p>They both started.  The listener started, guiltily, too; for she thought there was another
      listener among the trees.  It was only rain, beginning to fall fast, in heavy drops.</p>
     <p>‘Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence, innocently supposing that its master is
      at home and will be charmed to receive me?’</p>
     <p>‘No!’</p>
     <p>‘Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed; though I am the most unfortunate fellow in
      the world, I believe, to have been insensible to all other women, and to have fallen prostrate
      at last under the foot of the most beautiful, and the most engaging, and the most imperious. 
      My dearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of your power.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him then and there,
      within her (Mrs. Sparsit’s) greedy hearing, tell her how he loved her, and how she was the
      stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had in life.  The objects he had
      lately pursued, turned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he flung
      away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her.  Its pursuit, nevertheless, if it kept
      him near her, or its renunciation if it took him from her, or flight if she shared it, or
      secrecy if she commanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him, so that she was
      true to him, — the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she had inspired at their
      first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of which he had thought himself incapable, whom
      she had received into her confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.  All this, and
      more, in his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her own gratified malice, in the dread of
      being discovered, in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves, and a
      thunderstorm rolling up — Mrs. Sparsit received into her mind, set off with such an
      unavoidable halo of confusion and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence and
      led his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or when, except that they had
      said it was to be that night.</p>
     <p>But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she tracked that one she
      must be right.  ‘Oh, my dearest love,’ thought Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you little think how well
      attended you are!’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the house.  What to do next?  It
      rained now, in a sheet of water.  Mrs. Sparsit’s white stockings were of many colours, green
      predominating; prickly things were in her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of
      their own making, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and her Roman
      nose.  In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the density of the shrubbery,
      considering what next?</p>
     <p>Lo, Louisa coming out of the house!  Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away.  She
      elopes!  She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf.</p>
     <p>Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she struck into a
      side-path parallel with the ride.  Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a
      short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the
      umbrageous darkness.</p>
     <p>When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped.  When she went
      on, Mrs. Sparsit went on.  She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green
      lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.  A train for
      Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her
      first place of destination.</p>
     <p>In Mrs. Sparsit’s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were necessary to
      change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee of the station wall, tumbled her
      shawl into a new shape, and put it on over her bonnet.  So disguised she had no fear of being
      recognized when she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small office. 
      Louisa sat waiting in a corner.  Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner.  Both listened to
      the thunder, which was loud, and to the rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the
      parapets of the arches.  Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw the
      lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks.</p>
     <p>The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening to a complaint of
      the heart, announced the train.  Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a
      bell, and a shriek; Louisa put into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little
      station a desert speck in the thunderstorm.</p>
     <p>Though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, Mrs. Sparsit exulted hugely.  The
      figure had plunged down the precipice, and she felt herself, as it were, attending on the
      body.  Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less
      than exult?  ‘She will be at Coketown long before him,’ thought Mrs. Sparsit, ‘though his
      horse is never so good.  Where will she wait for him?  And where will they go together? 
      Patience.  We shall see.’</p>
     <p>The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion, when the train stopped at its
      destination.  Gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed, and streets were under
      water.  In the first instant of alighting, Mrs. Sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the
      waiting coaches, which were in great request.  ‘She will get into one,’ she considered, ‘and
      will be away before I can follow in another.  At all risks of being run over, I must see the
      number, and hear the order given to the coachman.’</p>
     <p>But, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation.  Louisa got into no coach, and was already
      gone.  The black eyes kept upon the railroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon
      it a moment too late.  The door not being opened after several minutes, Mrs. Sparsit passed it
      and repassed it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.  Wet through and through: with
      her feet squelching and squashing in her shoes whenever she moved; with a rash of rain upon
      her classical visage; with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her clothes spoiled; with
      damp impressions of every button, string, and hook-and-eye she wore, printed off upon her
      highly connected back; with a stagnant verdure on her general exterior, such as accumulates on
      an old park fence in a mouldy lane; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst into tears of
      bitterness and say, ‘I have lost her!’</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XII DOWN</head>
     <p>The national dustmen, after entertaining one another with a great many noisy little
      fights among themselves, had dispersed for the present, and Mr. Gradgrind was at home for the
      vacation.</p>
     <p>He sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock, proving something no doubt —
      probably, in the main, that the Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist.  The noise of the rain did
      not disturb him much; but it attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head
      sometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements.  When it thundered very
      loudly, he glanced towards Coketown, having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys
      might be struck by lightning.</p>
     <p>The thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like a deluge, when the
      door of his room opened.  He looked round the lamp upon his table, and saw, with amazement,
      his eldest daughter.</p>
     <p>‘Louisa!’</p>
     <p>‘Father, I want to speak to you.’</p>
     <p>‘What is the matter?  How strange you look!  And good Heaven,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, wondering
      more and more, ‘have you come here exposed to this storm?’</p>
     <p>She put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew.  ‘Yes.’  Then she uncovered her head,
      and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might, stood looking at him: so colourless, so
      dishevelled, so defiant and despairing, that he was afraid of her.</p>
     <p>‘What is it?  I conjure you, Louisa, tell me what is the matter.’</p>
     <p>She dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold hand on his arm.</p>
     <p>‘Father, you have trained me from my cradle?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.’</p>
     <p>He looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating: ‘Curse the hour?  Curse the
      hour?’</p>
     <p>‘How could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it
      from the state of conscious death?  Where are the graces of my soul?  Where are the sentiments
      of my heart?  What have you done, O father, what have you done, with the garden that should
      have bloomed once, in this great wilderness here!’</p>
     <p>She struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom.</p>
     <p>‘If it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole
      life sinks.  I did not mean to say this; but, father, you remember the last time we conversed
      in this room?’</p>
     <p>He had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now, that it was with difficulty he
      answered, ‘Yes, Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘What has risen to my lips now, would have risen to my lips then, if you had given me a
      moment’s help.  I don’t reproach you, father.  What you have never nurtured in me, you have
      never nurtured in yourself; but O! if you had only done so long ago, or if you had only
      neglected me, what a much better and much happier creature I should have been this day!’</p>
     <p>On hearing this, after all his care, he bowed his head upon his hand and groaned aloud.</p>
     <p>‘Father, if you had known, when we were last together here, what even I feared while I
      strove against it — as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural
      prompting that has arisen in my heart; if you had known that there lingered in my breast,
      sensibilities, affections, weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength, defying all
      the calculations ever made by man, and no more known to his arithmetic than his Creator is, —
      would you have given me to the husband whom I am now sure that I hate?’</p>
     <p>He said, ‘No.  No, my poor child.’</p>
     <p>‘Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and
      spoiled me?  Would you have robbed me — for no one’s enrichment — only for the greater
      desolation of this world — of the immaterial part of my life, the spring and summer of my
      belief, my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in which
      I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them, and to hope in my little
      sphere to make them better?’</p>
     <p>‘O no, no.  No, Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘Yet, father, if I had been stone blind; if I had groped my way by my sense of touch, and
      had been free, while I knew the shapes and surfaces of things, to exercise my fancy somewhat,
      in regard to them; I should have been a million times wiser, happier, more loving, more
      contented, more innocent and human in all good respects, than I am with the eyes I have.  Now,
      hear what I have come to say.’</p>
     <p>He moved, to support her with his arm.  She rising as he did so, they stood close together:
      she, with a hand upon his shoulder, looking fixedly in his face.</p>
     <p>‘With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which have never been for a moment appeased; with
      an ardent impulse towards some region where rules, and figures, and definitions were not quite
      absolute; I have grown up, battling every inch of my way.’</p>
     <p>‘I never knew you were unhappy, my child.’</p>
     <p>‘Father, I always knew it.  In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better
      angel into a demon.  What I have learned has left me doubting, misbelieving, despising,
      regretting, what I have not learned; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would
      soon go by, and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.’</p>
     <p>‘And you so young, Louisa!’ he said with pity.</p>
     <p>‘And I so young.  In this condition, father — for I show you now, without fear or favour,
      the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it — you proposed my husband to me.  I took
      him.  I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him.  I knew, and, father, you knew,
      and he knew, that I never did.  I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being
      pleasant and useful to Tom.  I made that wild escape into something visionary, and have slowly
      found out how wild it was.  But Tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my
      life; perhaps he became so because I knew so well how to pity him.  It matters little now,
      except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors.’</p>
     <p>As her father held her in his arms, she put her other hand upon his other shoulder, and
      still looking fixedly in his face, went on.</p>
     <p>‘When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into rebellion against the tie, the old
      strife, made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual
      natures, and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me, father, until they shall
      be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul.’</p>
     <p>‘Louisa!’ he said, and said imploringly; for he well remembered what had passed between them
      in their former interview.</p>
     <p>‘I do not reproach you, father, I make no complaint.  I am here with another object.’</p>
     <p>‘What can I do, child?  Ask me what you will.’</p>
     <p>‘I am coming to it.  Father, chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance; a man such as
      I had had no experience of; used to the world; light, polished, easy; making no pretences;
      avowing the low estimate of everything, that I was half afraid to form in secret; conveying to
      me almost immediately, though I don’t know how or by what degrees, that he understood me, and
      read my thoughts.  I could not find that he was worse than I.  There seemed to be a near
      affinity between us.  I only wondered it should be worth his while, who cared for nothing
      else, to care so much for me.’</p>
     <p>‘For you, Louisa!’</p>
     <p>Her father might instinctively have loosened his hold, but that he felt her strength
      departing from her, and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regarding him.</p>
     <p>‘I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence.  It matters very little how he gained
      it.  Father, he did gain it.  What you know of the story of my marriage, he soon knew, just as
      well.’</p>
     <p>Her father’s face was ashy white, and he held her in both his arms.</p>
     <p>‘I have done no worse, I have not disgraced you.  But if you ask me whether I have loved
      him, or do love him, I tell you plainly, father, that it may be so.  I don’t know.’</p>
     <p>She took her hands suddenly from his shoulders, and pressed them both upon her side; while
      in her face, not like itself — and in her figure, drawn up, resolute to finish by a last
      effort what she had to say — the feelings long suppressed broke loose.</p>
     <p>‘This night, my husband being away, he has been with me, declaring himself my lover.  This
      minute he expects me, for I could release myself of his presence by no other means.  I do not
      know that I am sorry, I do not know that I am ashamed, I do not know that I am degraded in my
      own esteem.  All that I know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not save me.  Now,
      father, you have brought me to this.  Save me by some other means!’</p>
     <p>He tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the floor, but she cried out in a
      terrible voice, ‘I shall die if you hold me!  Let me fall upon the ground!’  And he laid her
      down there, and saw the pride of his heart and the triumph of his system, lying, an insensible
      heap, at his feet.</p>

    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER I ANOTHER THING NEEDFUL</head>
     <p>Louisa awoke from a torpor, and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed at home,
      and her old room.  It seemed, at first, as if all that had happened since the days when these
      objects were familiar to her were the shadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became
      more real to her sight, the events became more real to her mind.</p>
     <p>She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were strained and sore,
      and she was very weak.  A curious passive inattention had such possession of her, that the
      presence of her little sister in the room did not attract her notice for some time.  Even when
      their eyes had met, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at
      her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand, before she asked:</p>
     <p>‘When was I brought to this room?’</p>
     <p>‘Last night, Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘Who brought me here?’</p>
     <p>‘Sissy, I believe.’</p>
     <p>‘Why do you believe so?’</p>
     <p>‘Because I found her here this morning.  She didn’t come to my bedside to wake me, as she
      always does; and I went to look for her.  She was not in her own room either; and I went
      looking for her all over the house, until I found her here taking care of you and cooling your
      head.  Will you see father? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke.’</p>
     <p>‘What a beaming face you have, Jane!’ said Louisa, as her young sister — timidly still —
      bent down to kiss her.</p>
     <p>‘Have I?  I am very glad you think so.  I am sure it must be Sissy’s doing.’</p>
     <p>The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself.  ‘You can tell father if
      you will.’  Then, staying her for a moment, she said, ‘It was you who made my room so
      cheerful, and gave it this look of welcome?’</p>
     <p>‘Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came.  It was — ’</p>
     <p>Louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.  When her sister had withdrawn, she turned
      her head back again, and lay with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father
      entered.</p>
     <p>He had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady, trembled in hers.  He
      sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking how she was, and dwelling on the necessity of
      her keeping very quiet after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.  He spoke
      in a subdued and troubled voice, very different from his usual dictatorial manner; and was
      often at a loss for words.</p>
     <p>‘My dear Louisa.  My poor daughter.’  He was so much at a loss at that place, that he
      stopped altogether.  He tried again.</p>
     <p>‘My unfortunate child.’  The place was so difficult to get over, that he tried again.</p>
     <p>‘It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed I have been,
      and still am, by what broke upon me last night.  The ground on which I stand has ceased to be
      solid under my feet.  The only support on which I leaned, and the strength of which it seemed,
      and still does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.  I am stunned by
      these discoveries.  I have no selfish meaning in what I say; but I find the shock of what
      broke upon me last night, to be very heavy indeed.’</p>
     <p>She could give him no comfort herein.  She had suffered the wreck of her whole life upon the
      rock.</p>
     <p>‘I will not say, Louisa, that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago, it
      would have been better for us both; better for your peace, and better for mine.  For I am
      sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind. 
      I had proved my — my system to myself, and I have rigidly administered it; and I must bear the
      responsibility of its failures.  I only entreat you to believe, my favourite child, that I
      have meant to do right.’</p>
     <p>He said it earnestly, and to do him justice he had.  In gauging fathomless deeps with his
      little mean excise-rod, and in staggering over the universe with his rusty stiff-legged
      compasses, he had meant to do great things.  Within the limits of his short tether he had
      tumbled about, annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of purpose than
      many of the blatant personages whose company he kept.</p>
     <p>‘I am well assured of what you say, father.  I know I have been your favourite child.  I
      know you have intended to make me happy.  I have never blamed you, and I never shall.’</p>
     <p>He took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.</p>
     <p>‘My dear, I have remained all night at my table, pondering again and again on what has so
      painfully passed between us.  When I consider your character; when I consider that what has
      been known to me for hours, has been concealed by you for years; when I consider under what
      immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion that I cannot
      but mistrust myself.’</p>
     <p>He might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at him.  He did add it
      in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her scattered hair from her forehead with his hand. 
      Such little actions, slight in another man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter
      received them as if they had been words of contrition.</p>
     <p>‘But,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a wretched sense of
      happiness, ‘if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past, Louisa, I should also mistrust
      myself for the present and the future.  To speak unreservedly to you, I do.  I am far from
      feeling convinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday, that I
      am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come
      home to make to me; that I have the right instinct — supposing it for the moment to be some
      quality of that nature — how to help you, and to set you right, my child.’</p>
     <p>She had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her arm, so that he could not see
      it.  All her wildness and passion had subsided; but, though softened, she was not in tears. 
      Her father was changed in nothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to
      see her in tears.</p>
     <p>‘Some persons hold,’ he pursued, still hesitating, ‘that there is a wisdom of the Head, and
      that there is a wisdom of the Heart.  I have not supposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust
      myself now.  I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient.  It may not be all-sufficient; how
      can I venture this morning to say it is!  If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have
      neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted, Louisa — ’</p>
     <p>He suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it even now.  She
      made him no answer, lying before him on her bed, still half-dressed, much as he had seen her
      lying on the floor of his room last night.</p>
     <p>‘Louisa,’ and his hand rested on her hair again, ‘I have been absent from here, my dear, a
      good deal of late; and though your sister’s training has been pursued according to — the
      system,’ he appeared to come to that word with great reluctance always, ‘it has necessarily
      been modified by daily associations begun, in her case, at an early age.  I ask you —
      ignorantly and humbly, my daughter — for the better, do you think?’</p>
     <p>‘Father,’ she replied, without stirring, ‘if any harmony has been awakened in her young
      breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord, let her thank Heaven for it, and go
      upon her happier way, taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.’</p>
     <p>‘O my child, my child!’ he said, in a forlorn manner, ‘I am an unhappy man to see you thus! 
      What avails it to me that you do not reproach me, if I so bitterly reproach myself!’  He bent
      his head, and spoke low to her.  ‘Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may have been
      slowly working about me in this house, by mere love and gratitude: that what the Head had left
      undone and could not do, the Heart may have been doing silently.  Can it be so?’</p>
     <p>She made him no reply.</p>
     <p>‘I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa.  How could I be arrogant, and you before me!  Can
      it be so?  Is it so, my dear?’  He looked upon her once more, lying cast away there; and
      without another word went out of the room.  He had not been long gone, when she heard a light
      tread near the door, and knew that some one stood beside her.</p>
     <p>She did not raise her head.  A dull anger that she should be seen in her distress, and that
      the involuntary look she had so resented should come to this fulfilment, smouldered within her
      like an unwholesome fire.  All closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy.  The air that would
      be healthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that would ripen it, tear
      it when caged up.  So in her bosom even now; the strongest qualities she possessed, long
      turned upon themselves, became a heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.</p>
     <p>It was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she understood herself to be
      supposed to have fallen asleep.  The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment.  Let it
      lie there, let it lie.</p>
     <p>It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she rested.  As she
      softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being so watched, some tears made their way
      into her eyes.  The face touched hers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she
      the cause of them.</p>
     <p>As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that she stood placidly
      near the bedside.</p>
     <p>‘I hope I have not disturbed you.  I have come to ask if you would let me stay with
      you?’</p>
     <p>‘Why should you stay with me?  My sister will miss you.  You are everything to her.’</p>
     <p>‘Am I?’ returned Sissy, shaking her head.  ‘I would be something to you, if I might.’</p>
     <p>‘What?’ said Louisa, almost sternly.</p>
     <p>‘Whatever you want most, if I could be that.  At all events, I would like to try to be as
      near it as I can.  And however far off that may be, I will never tire of trying.  Will you let
      me?’</p>
     <p>‘My father sent you to ask me.’</p>
     <p>‘No indeed,’ replied Sissy.  ‘He told me that I might come in now, but he sent me away from
      the room this morning — or at least — ’</p>
     <p>She hesitated and stopped.</p>
     <p>‘At least, what?’ said Louisa, with her searching eyes upon her.</p>
     <p>‘I thought it best myself that I should be sent away, for I felt very uncertain whether you
      would like to find me here.’</p>
     <p>‘Have I always hated you so much?’</p>
     <p>‘I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have always wished that you should know it. 
      But you changed to me a little, shortly before you left home.  Not that I wondered at it.  You
      knew so much, and I knew so little, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were
      among other friends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.’</p>
     <p>Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.  Louisa understood the loving
      pretence, and her heart smote her.</p>
     <p>‘May I try?’ said Sissy, emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that was insensibly
      drooping towards her.</p>
     <p>Louisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another moment, held it in one
      of hers, and answered:</p>
     <p>‘First, Sissy, do you know what I am?  I am so proud and so hardened, so confused and
      troubled, so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself, that everything is stormy, dark,
      and wicked to me.  Does not that repel you?’</p>
     <p>‘No!’</p>
     <p>‘I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste, that if I had
      been bereft of sense to this hour, and instead of being as learned as you think me, had to
      begin to acquire the simplest truths, I could not want a guide to peace, contentment, honour,
      all the good of which I am quite devoid, more abjectly than I do.  Does not that repel
      you?’</p>
     <p>‘No!’</p>
     <p>In the innocence of her brave affection, and the brimming up of her old devoted spirit, the
      once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon the darkness of the other.</p>
     <p>Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow there.  She fell
      upon her knees, and clinging to this stroller’s child looked up at her almost with
      veneration.</p>
     <p>‘Forgive me, pity me, help me!  Have compassion on my great need, and let me lay this head
      of mine upon a loving heart!’</p>
     <p>‘O lay it here!’ cried Sissy.  ‘Lay it here, my dear.’</p>

     <head>CHAPTER II VERY RIDICULOUS</head>
     <p>Mr. James Harthouse passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much hurry,
      that the World, with its best glass in his eye, would scarcely have recognized him during that
      insane interval, as the brother Jem of the honourable and jocular member.  He was positively
      agitated.  He several times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar manner.  He went in
      and went out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an object.  He rode like a
      highwayman.  In a word, he was so horribly bored by existing circumstances, that he forgot to
      go in for boredom in the manner prescribed by the authorities.</p>
     <p>After putting his horse at Coketown through the storm, as if it were a leap, he waited up
      all night: from time to time ringing his bell with the greatest fury, charging the porter who
      kept watch with delinquency in withholding letters or messages that could not fail to have
      been entrusted to him, and demanding restitution on the spot.  The dawn coming, the morning
      coming, and the day coming, and neither message nor letter coming with either, he went down to
      the country house.  There, the report was, Mr. Bounderby away, and Mrs. Bounderby in town. 
      Left for town suddenly last evening.  Not even known to be gone until receipt of message,
      importing that her return was not to be expected for the present.</p>
     <p>In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town.  He went to the
      house in town.  Mrs. Bounderby not there.  He looked in at the Bank.  Mr. Bounderby away and
      Mrs. Sparsit away.  Mrs. Sparsit away?  Who could have been reduced to sudden extremity for
      the company of that griffin!</p>
     <p>‘Well!  I don’t know,’ said Tom, who had his own reasons for being uneasy about it.  ‘She
      was off somewhere at daybreak this morning.  She’s always full of mystery; I hate her.  So I
      do that white chap; he’s always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow.’</p>
     <p>‘Where were you last night, Tom?’</p>
     <p>‘Where was I last night!’ said Tom.  ‘Come!  I like that.  I was waiting for you, Mr.
      Harthouse, till it came down as <hi>I</hi> never saw it come down before.  Where was I too! 
      Where were you, you mean.’</p>
     <p>‘I was prevented from coming — detained.’</p>
     <p>‘Detained!’ murmured Tom.  ‘Two of us were detained.  I was detained looking for you, till I
      lost every train but the mail.  It would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a
      night, and have to walk home through a pond.  I was obliged to sleep in town after all.’</p>
     <p>‘Where?’</p>
     <p>‘Where?  Why, in my own bed at Bounderby’s.’</p>
     <p>‘Did you see your sister?’</p>
     <p>‘How the deuce,’ returned Tom, staring, ‘could I see my sister when she was fifteen miles
      off?’</p>
     <p>Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he was so true a friend, Mr.
      Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the smallest conceivable amount of
      ceremony, and debated for the hundredth time what all this could mean?  He made only one thing
      clear.  It was, that whether she was in town or out of town, whether he had been premature
      with her who was so hard to comprehend, or she had lost courage, or they were discovered, or
      some mischance or mistake, at present incomprehensible, had occurred, he must remain to
      confront his fortune, whatever it was.  The hotel where he was known to live when condemned to
      that region of blackness, was the stake to which he was tied.  As to all the rest — What will
      be, will be.</p>
     <p>‘So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or an assignation, or a penitent
      remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby in the Lancashire manner —
      which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs — I’ll dine,’ said
      Mr. James Harthouse.  ‘Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight; and if anything of a
      British nature is to come off between us, it may be as well to be in training.’</p>
     <p>Therefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa, ordered ‘Some dinner
      at six — with a beefsteak in it,’ and got through the intervening time as well as he could. 
      That was not particularly well; for he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours
      went on, and no kind of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at compound
      interest.</p>
     <p>However, he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do, and entertained himself
      with the facetious idea of the training more than once.  ‘It wouldn’t be bad,’ he yawned at
      one time, ‘to give the waiter five shillings, and throw him.’  At another time it occurred to
      him, ‘Or a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour.’  But these
      jests did not tell materially on the afternoon, or his suspense; and, sooth to say, they both
      lagged fearfully.</p>
     <p>It was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking about in the pattern of the
      carpet, looking out of the window, listening at the door for footsteps, and occasionally
      becoming rather hot when any steps approached that room.  But, after dinner, when the day
      turned to twilight, and the twilight turned to night, and still no communication was made to
      him, it began to be as he expressed it, ‘like the Holy Office and slow torture.’  However,
      still true to his conviction that indifference was the genuine high-breeding (the only
      conviction he had), he seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a
      newspaper.</p>
     <p>He had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this newspaper, when the waiter
      appeared and said, at once mysteriously and apologetically:</p>
     <p>‘Beg your pardon, sir.  You’re wanted, sir, if you please.’</p>
     <p>A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to the swell mob,
      caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with bristling indignation, what the Devil
      he meant by ‘wanted’?</p>
     <p>‘Beg your pardon, sir.  Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.’</p>
     <p>‘Outside?  Where?’</p>
     <p>‘Outside this door, sir.’</p>
     <p>Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block-head duly qualified for that
      consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery.  A young woman whom he had never seen
      stood there.  Plainly dressed, very quiet, very pretty.  As he conducted her into the room and
      placed a chair for her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she was even prettier
      than he had at first believed.  Her face was innocent and youthful, and its expression
      remarkably pleasant.  She was not afraid of him, or in any way disconcerted; she seemed to
      have her mind entirely preoccupied with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted
      that consideration for herself.</p>
     <p>‘I speak to Mr. Harthouse?’ she said, when they were alone.</p>
     <p>‘To Mr. Harthouse.’  He added in his mind, ‘And you speak to him with the most confiding
      eyes I ever saw, and the most earnest voice (though so quiet) I ever heard.’</p>
     <p>‘If I do not understand — and I do not, sir’ — said Sissy, ‘what your honour as a gentleman
      binds you to, in other matters:’ the blood really rose in his face as she began in these
      words: ‘I am sure I may rely upon it to keep my visit secret, and to keep secret what I am
      going to say.  I will rely upon it, if you will tell me I may so far trust — ’</p>
     <p>‘You may, I assure you.’</p>
     <p>‘I am young, as you see; I am alone, as you see.  In coming to you, sir, I have no advice or
      encouragement beyond my own hope.’  He thought, ‘But that is very strong,’ as he followed the
      momentary upward glance of her eyes.  He thought besides, ‘This is a very odd beginning.  I
      don’t see where we are going.’</p>
     <p>‘I think,’ said Sissy, ‘you have already guessed whom I left just now!’</p>
     <p>‘I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four-and-twenty hours
      (which have appeared as many years),’ he returned, ‘on a lady’s account.  The hopes I have
      been encouraged to form that you come from that lady, do not deceive me, I trust.’</p>
     <p>‘I left her within an hour.’</p>
     <p>‘At — !’</p>
     <p>‘At her father’s.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Harthouse’s face lengthened in spite of his coolness, and his perplexity increased. 
      ‘Then I certainly,’ he thought, ‘do <hi>not</hi> see where we are going.’</p>
     <p>‘She hurried there last night.  She arrived there in great agitation, and was insensible all
      through the night.  I live at her father’s, and was with her.  You may be sure, sir, you will
      never see her again as long as you live.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Harthouse drew a long breath; and, if ever man found himself in the position of not
      knowing what to say, made the discovery beyond all question that he was so circumstanced.  The
      child-like ingenuousness with which his visitor spoke, her modest fearlessness, her
      truthfulness which put all artifice aside, her entire forgetfulness of herself in her earnest
      quiet holding to the object with which she had come; all this, together with her reliance on
      his easily given promise — which in itself shamed him — presented something in which he was so
      inexperienced, and against which he knew any of his usual weapons would fall so powerless;
      that not a word could he rally to his relief.</p>
     <p>At last he said:</p>
     <p>‘So startling an announcement, so confidently made, and by such lips, is really
      disconcerting in the last degree.  May I be permitted to inquire, if you are charged to convey
      that information to me in those hopeless words, by the lady of whom we speak?’</p>
     <p>‘I have no charge from her.’</p>
     <p>‘The drowning man catches at the straw.  With no disrespect for your judgment, and with no
      doubt of your sincerity, excuse my saying that I cling to the belief that there is yet hope
      that I am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady’s presence.’</p>
     <p>‘There is not the least hope.  The first object of my coming here, sir, is to assure you
      that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again, than
      there would be if she had died when she came home last night.’</p>
     <p>‘Must believe?  But if I can’t — or if I should, by infirmity of nature, be obstinate — and
      won’t — ’</p>
     <p>‘It is still true.  There is no hope.’</p>
     <p>James Harthouse looked at her with an incredulous smile upon his lips; but her mind looked
      over and beyond him, and the smile was quite thrown away.</p>
     <p>He bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.</p>
     <p>‘Well!  If it should unhappily appear,’ he said, ‘after due pains and duty on my part, that
      I am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment, I shall not become the lady’s
      persecutor.  But you said you had no commission from her?’</p>
     <p>‘I have only the commission of my love for her, and her love for me.  I have no other trust,
      than that I have been with her since she came home, and that she has given me her confidence. 
      I have no further trust, than that I know something of her character and her marriage.  O Mr.
      Harthouse, I think you had that trust too!’</p>
     <p>He was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been — in that nest of addled eggs,
      where the birds of heaven would have lived if they had not been whistled away — by the fervour
      of this reproach.</p>
     <p>‘I am not a moral sort of fellow,’ he said, ‘and I never make any pretensions to the
      character of a moral sort of fellow.  I am as immoral as need be.  At the same time, in
      bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation, or in
      unfortunately compromising her in any way, or in committing myself by any expression of
      sentiments towards her, not perfectly reconcilable with — in fact with — the domestic hearth;
      or in taking any advantage of her father’s being a machine, or of her brother’s being a whelp,
      or of her husband’s being a bear; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no
      particularly evil intentions, but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so
      perfectly diabolical, that I had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until I
      began to turn it over.  Whereas I find,’ said Mr. James Harthouse, in conclusion, ‘that it is
      really in several volumes.’</p>
     <p>Though he said all this in his frivolous way, the way seemed, for that once, a conscious
      polishing of but an ugly surface.  He was silent for a moment; and then proceeded with a more
      self-possessed air, though with traces of vexation and disappointment that would not be
      polished out.</p>
     <p>‘After what has been just now represented to me, in a manner I find it impossible to doubt —
      I know of hardly any other source from which I could have accepted it so readily — I feel
      bound to say to you, in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed, that I cannot
      refuse to contemplate the possibility (however unexpected) of my seeing the lady no more.  I
      am solely to blame for the thing having come to this — and — and, I cannot say,’ he added,
      rather hard up for a general peroration, ‘that I have any sanguine expectation of ever
      becoming a moral sort of fellow, or that I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow
      whatever.’</p>
     <p>Sissy’s face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him was not finished.</p>
     <p>‘You spoke,’ he resumed, as she raised her eyes to him again, ‘of your first object.  I may
      assume that there is a second to be mentioned?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘Will you oblige me by confiding it?’</p>
     <p>‘Mr. Harthouse,’ returned Sissy, with a blending of gentleness and steadiness that quite
      defeated him, and with a simple confidence in his being bound to do what she required, that
      held him at a singular disadvantage, ‘the only reparation that remains with you, is to leave
      here immediately and finally.  I am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong
      and harm you have done.  I am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in
      your power to make.  I do not say that it is much, or that it is enough; but it is something,
      and it is necessary.  Therefore, though without any other authority than I have given you, and
      even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself, I ask you to depart
      from this place to-night, under an obligation never to return to it.’</p>
     <p>If she had asserted any influence over him beyond her plain faith in the truth and right of
      what she said; if she had concealed the least doubt or irresolution, or had harboured for the
      best purpose any reserve or pretence; if she had shown, or felt, the lightest trace of any
      sensitiveness to his ridicule or his astonishment, or any remonstrance he might offer; he
      would have carried it against her at this point.  But he could as easily have changed a clear
      sky by looking at it in surprise, as affect her.</p>
     <p>‘But do you know,’ he asked, quite at a loss, ‘the extent of what you ask?  You probably are
      not aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous enough in itself, but
      which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate
      manner?  You probably are not aware of that, but I assure you it’s the fact.’</p>
     <p>It had no effect on Sissy, fact or no fact.</p>
     <p>‘Besides which,’ said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn or two across the room, dubiously, ‘it’s
      so alarmingly absurd.  It would make a man so ridiculous, after going in for these fellows, to
      back out in such an incomprehensible way.’</p>
     <p>‘I am quite sure,’ repeated Sissy, ‘that it is the only reparation in your power, sir.  I am
      quite sure, or I would not have come here.’</p>
     <p>He glanced at her face, and walked about again.  ‘Upon my soul, I don’t know what to say. 
      So immensely absurd!’</p>
     <p>It fell to his lot, now, to stipulate for secrecy.</p>
     <p>‘If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,’ he said, stopping again presently, and
      leaning against the chimney-piece, ‘it could only be in the most inviolable confidence.’</p>
     <p>‘I will trust to you, sir,’ returned Sissy, ‘and you will trust to me.’</p>
     <p>His leaning against the chimney-piece reminded him of the night with the whelp.  It was the
      self-same chimney-piece, and somehow he felt as if <hi>he</hi> were the whelp to-night.  He
      could make no way at all.</p>
     <p>‘I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position,’ he said, after looking
      down, and looking up, and laughing, and frowning, and walking off, and walking back again. 
      ‘But I see no way out of it.  What will be, will be.  <hi>This</hi> will be, I suppose.  I
      must take off myself, I imagine — in short, I engage to do it.’</p>
     <p>Sissy rose.  She was not surprised by the result, but she was happy in it, and her face
      beamed brightly.</p>
     <p>‘You will permit me to say,’ continued Mr. James Harthouse, ‘that I doubt if any other
      ambassador, or ambassadress, could have addressed me with the same success.  I must not only
      regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points. 
      Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy’s name?’</p>
     <p>‘<hi>My</hi> name?’ said the ambassadress.</p>
     <p>‘The only name I could possibly care to know, to-night.’</p>
     <p>‘Sissy Jupe.’</p>
     <p>‘Pardon my curiosity at parting.  Related to the family?’</p>
     <p>‘I am only a poor girl,’ returned Sissy.  ‘I was separated from my father — he was only a
      stroller — and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind.  I have lived in the house ever since.’</p>
     <p>She was gone.</p>
     <p>‘It wanted this to complete the defeat,’ said Mr. James Harthouse, sinking, with a resigned
      air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a little while.  ‘The defeat may now be considered
      perfectly accomplished.  Only a poor girl — only a stroller — only James Harthouse made
      nothing of — only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure.’</p>
     <p>The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile.  He took a pen upon the instant,
      and wrote the following note (in appropriate hieroglyphics) to his brother:</p>
     <quote>
      <p>Dear Jack, — All up at Coketown.  Bored out of the place, and going in for camels.</p>
      <p>Affectionately, <hi>Jem</hi>.</p></quote>
     <p>He rang the bell.</p>
     <p>‘Send my fellow here.’</p>
     <p>‘Gone to bed, sir.’</p>
     <p>‘Tell him to get up, and pack up.’</p>
     <p>He wrote two more notes.  One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his retirement from that part of
      the country, and showing where he would be found for the next fortnight.  The other, similar
      in effect, to Mr. Gradgrind.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions, he
      had left the tall chimneys of Coketown behind,
      <pb n=" 179"/>and was in a railway carriage, tearing and glaring over the dark landscape.</p>
     <p>The moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James Harthouse derived some comfortable
      reflections afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one of his few actions that made any
      amends for anything, and as a token to himself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad
      business.  But it was not so, at all.  A secret sense of having failed and been ridiculous — a
      dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of things, would say at his expense
      if they knew it — so oppressed him, that what was about the very best passage in his life was
      the one of all others he would not have owned to on any account, and the only one that made
      him ashamed of himself.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER III VERY DECIDED</head>
     <p>The indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit, with a violent cold upon her, her voice reduced to
      a whisper, and her stately frame so racked by continual sneezes that it seemed in danger of
      dismemberment, gave chase to her patron until she found him in the metropolis; and there,
      majestically sweeping in upon him at his hotel in St. James’s Street, exploded the
      combustibles with which she was charged, and blew up.  Having executed her mission with
      infinite relish, this high-minded woman then fainted away on Mr. Bounderby’s coat-collar.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby’s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as
      she might through various stages of suffering on the floor.  He next had recourse to the
      administration of potent restoratives, such as screwing the patient’s thumbs, smiting her
      hands, abundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth.  When these attentions
      had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled her into a fast train without offering
      any other refreshment, and carried her back to Coketown more dead than alive.</p>
     <p>Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle on her arrival at
      her journey’s end; but considered in any other light, the amount of damage she had by that
      time sustained was excessive, and impaired her claims to admiration.  Utterly heedless of the
      wear and tear of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr.
      Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone Lodge.</p>
     <p>‘Now, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law’s room late at night;
      ‘here’s a lady here — Mrs. Sparsit — you know Mrs. Sparsit — who has something to say to you
      that will strike you dumb.’</p>
     <p>‘You have missed my letter!’ exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the apparition.</p>
     <p>‘Missed your letter, sir!’ bawled Bounderby.  ‘The present time is no time for letters.  No
      man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with his mind in the state it’s
      in now.’</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, ‘I speak of a very
      special letter I have written to you, in reference to Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘Tom Gradgrind,’ replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several times with great
      vehemence on the table, ‘I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me, in reference
      to Louisa.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am, stand forward!’</p>
     <p>That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony, without any voice and with
      painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat, became so aggravating and underwent so many
      facial contortions, that Mr. Bounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook
      her.</p>
     <p>‘If you can’t get it out, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘leave <hi>me</hi> to get it out.  This is
      not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be totally inaudible, and seemingly
      swallowing marbles.  Tom Gradgrind, Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a
      situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious
      gentleman-friend, Mr. James Harthouse.’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘Ah!  Indeed!’ cried Bounderby.  ‘And in that conversation — ’</p>
     <p>‘It is not necessary to repeat its tenor, Bounderby.  I know what passed.’</p>
     <p>‘You do?  Perhaps,’ said Bounderby, staring with all his might at his so quiet and assuasive
      father-in-law, ‘you know where your daughter is at the present time!’</p>
     <p>‘Undoubtedly.  She is here.’</p>
     <p>‘Here?’</p>
     <p>‘My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on all accounts. 
      Louisa is here.  The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of
      whom you speak, and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you, Louisa
      hurried here, for protection.  I myself had not been at home many hours, when I received her —
      here, in this room.  She hurried by the train to town, she ran from town to this house,
      through a raging storm, and presented herself before me in a state of distraction.  Of course,
      she has remained here ever since.  Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to be
      more quiet.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every direction except Mrs.
      Sparsit’s direction; and then, abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that
      wretched woman:</p>
     <p>‘Now, ma’am!  We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer,
      for going about the country at express pace, with no other luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull,
      ma’am!’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ whispered Mrs. Sparsit, ‘my nerves are at present too much shaken, and my health is
      at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in
      tears.’  (Which she did.)</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘without making any observation to you that may not be made
      with propriety to a woman of good family, what I have got to add to that, is that there is
      something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.  And the coach
      in which we came here being at the door, you’ll allow me to hand you down to it, and pack you
      home to the Bank: where the best course for you to pursue, will be to put your feet into the
      hottest water you can bear, and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into
      bed.’  With these words, Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady, and
      escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way.  He
      soon returned alone.</p>
     <p>‘Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to speak to me,’ he
      resumed, ‘here I am.  But, I am not in a very agreeable state, I tell you plainly: not
      relishing this business, even as it is, and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully
      and submissively treated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated
      by his wife.  You have your opinion, I dare say; and I have mine, I know.  If you mean to say
      anything to me to-night, that goes against this candid remark, you had better let it
      alone.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr. Bounderby took particular pains
      to harden himself at all points.  It was his amiable nature.</p>
     <p>‘My dear Bounderby,’ Mr. Gradgrind began in reply.</p>
     <p>‘Now, you’ll excuse me,’ said Bounderby, ‘but I don’t want to be too dear.  That, to start
      with.  When I begin to be dear to a man, I generally find that his intention is to come over
      me.  I am not speaking to you politely; but, as you are aware, I am <hi>not</hi> polite.  If
      you like politeness, you know where to get it.  You have your gentleman-friends, you know, and
      they’ll serve you with as much of the article as you want.  I don’t keep it myself.’</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby,’ urged Mr. Gradgrind, ‘we are all liable to mistakes — ’</p>
     <p>‘I thought you couldn’t make ’em,’ interrupted Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Perhaps I thought so.  But, I say we are all liable to mistakes and I should feel sensible
      of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would spare me these references to Harthouse.  I
      shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not
      persist in connecting him with mine.’</p>
     <p>‘I never mentioned his name!’ said Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Well, well!’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive, air.  And he sat
      for a little while pondering.  ‘Bounderby, I see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite
      understood Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘Who do you mean by We?’</p>
     <p>‘Let me say I, then,’ he returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted question; ‘I doubt
      whether I have understood Louisa.  I doubt whether I have been quite right in the manner of
      her education.’</p>
     <p>‘There you hit it,’ returned Bounderby.  ‘There I agree with you.  You have found it out at
      last, have you?  Education!  I’ll tell you what education is — To be tumbled out of doors,
      neck and crop, and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows.  That’s what
       <hi>I</hi> call education.’</p>
     <p>‘I think your good sense will perceive,’ Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in all humility, ‘that
      whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would be difficult of general application to
      girls.’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t see it at all, sir,’ returned the obstinate Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘Well,’ sighed Mr. Gradgrind, ‘we will not enter into the question.  I assure you I have no
      desire to be controversial.  I seek to repair what is amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you
      will assist me in a good spirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t understand you, yet,’ said Bounderby, with determined obstinacy, ‘and therefore I
      won’t make any promises.’</p>
     <p>‘In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,’ Mr. Gradgrind proceeded, in the same
      depressed and propitiatory manner, ‘I appear to myself to have become better informed as to
      Louisa’s character, than in previous years.  The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon
      me, and the discovery is not mine.  I think there are — Bounderby, you will be surprised to
      hear me say this — I think there are qualities in Louisa, which — which have been harshly
      neglected, and — and a little perverted.  And — and I would suggest to you, that — that if you
      would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while — and
      to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration — it — it would be the
      better for the happiness of all of us.  Louisa,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, shading his face with his
      hand, ‘has always been my favourite child.’</p>
     <p>The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words, that
      he seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink of a fit.  With his very ears a bright purple
      shot with crimson, he pent up his indignation, however, and said:</p>
     <p>‘You’d like to keep her here for a time?’</p>
     <p>‘I — I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow Louisa to remain
      here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of course Cecilia Jupe), who understands
      her, and in whom she trusts.’</p>
     <p>‘I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, standing up with his hands in his
      pockets, ‘that you are of opinion that there’s what people call some incompatibility between
      Loo Bounderby and myself.’</p>
     <p>‘I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa, and — and — and almost
      all the relations in which I have placed her,’ was her father’s sorrowful reply.</p>
     <p>‘Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby the flushed, confronting him with his
      legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his pockets, and his hair like a hayfield wherein his
      windy anger was boisterous.  ‘You have said your say; I am going to say mine.  I am a Coketown
      man.  I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  I know the bricks of this town, and I know the works
      of this town, and I know the chimneys of this town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I
      know the Hands of this town.  I know ’em all pretty well.  They’re real.  When a man tells me
      anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever he is, that I know what
      he means.  He means turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up
      with a coach and six.  That’s what your daughter wants.  Since you are of opinion that she
      ought to have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.  Because, Tom Gradgrind,
      she will never have it from me.’</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘I hoped, after my entreaty, you would have taken a
      different tone.’</p>
     <p>‘Just wait a bit,’ retorted Bounderby; ‘you have said your say, I believe.  I heard you out;
      hear me out, if you please.  Don’t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as
      inconsistency, because, although I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present
      position, I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that.  Now, there’s an
      incompatibility of some sort or another, I am given to understand by you, between your
      daughter and me.  I’ll give <hi>you</hi> to understand, in reply to that, that there
      unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude — to be summed up in this — that
      your daughter don’t properly know her husband’s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense
      as would become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance.  That’s plain speaking, I
      hope.’</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby,’ urged Mr. Gradgrind, ‘this is unreasonable.’</p>
     <p>‘Is it?’ said Bounderby.  ‘I am glad to hear you say so.  Because when Tom Gradgrind, with
      his new lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be
      devilish sensible.  With your permission I am going on.  You know my origin; and you know that
      for a good many years of my life I didn’t want a shoeing-horn, in consequence of not having a
      shoe.  Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper, that there are ladies — born ladies —
      belonging to families — Families! — who next to worship the ground I walk on.’</p>
     <p>He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law’s head.</p>
     <p>‘Whereas your daughter,’ proceeded Bounderby, ‘is far from being a born lady.  That you
      know, yourself.  Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such things, for you are very
      well aware I don’t; but that such is the fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can’t change it.  Why
      do I say this?’</p>
     <p>‘Not, I fear,’ observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, ‘to spare me.’</p>
     <p>‘Hear me out,’ said Bounderby, ‘and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round.  I
      say this, because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your
      daughter has conducted herself, and to witness her insensibility.  They have wondered how I
      have suffered it.  And I wonder myself now, and I won’t suffer it.’</p>
     <p>‘Bounderby,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, rising, ‘the less we say to-night the better, I
      think.’</p>
     <p>‘On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say to-night, the better, I think.  That is,’
      the consideration checked him, ‘till I have said all I mean to say, and then I don’t care how
      soon we stop.  I come to a question that may shorten the business.  What do you mean by the
      proposal you made just now?’</p>
     <p>‘What do I mean, Bounderby?’</p>
     <p>‘By your visiting proposition,’ said Bounderby, with an inflexible jerk of the hayfield.</p>
     <p>‘I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner, for allowing Louisa
      a period of repose and reflection here, which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better
      in many respects.’</p>
     <p>‘To a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility?’ said Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘If you put it in those terms.’</p>
     <p>‘What made you think of this?’ said Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been understood.  Is it asking too much,
      Bounderby, that you, so far her elder, should aid in trying to set her right?  You have
      accepted a great charge of her; for better for worse, for — ’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to Stephen Blackpool,
      but he cut the quotation short with an angry start.</p>
     <p>‘Come!’ said he, ‘I don’t want to be told about that.  I know what I took her for, as well
      as you do.  Never you mind what I took her for; that’s my look out.’</p>
     <p>‘I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or less in the wrong,
      not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have
      accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards
      Louisa.’</p>
     <p>‘I think differently,’ blustered Bounderby.  ‘I am going to finish this business according
      to my own opinions.  Now, I don’t want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind.  To
      tell you the truth, I don’t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a
      subject.  As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best.  If he
      falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don’t fall in my way, I shan’t, for it won’t
      be worth my while to do it.  As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have
      done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don’t come home to-morrow, by twelve o’clock at
      noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel
      and so forth over here, and you’ll take charge of her for the future.  What I shall say to
      people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be
      this.  I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she’s the daughter of Tom Gradgrind,
      and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn’t pull together.  I am pretty well
      known to be rather an uncommon man, I believe; and most people will understand fast enough
      that it must be a woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up to
      my mark.’</p>
     <p>‘Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, Bounderby,’ urged Mr. Gradgrind, ‘before
      you commit yourself to such a decision.’</p>
     <p>‘I always come to a decision,’ said Bounderby, tossing his hat on: ‘and whatever I do, I do
      at once.  I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind’s addressing such a remark to Josiah
      Bounderby of Coketown, knowing what he knows of him, if I could be surprised by anything Tom
      Gradgrind did, after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.  I have given you my
      decision, and I have got no more to say.  Good night!’</p>
     <p>So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed.  At five minutes past twelve o’clock
      next day, he directed Mrs. Bounderby’s property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom
      Gradgrind’s; advertised his country retreat for sale by private contract; and resumed a
      bachelor life.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER IV LOST</head>
     <p>The robbery at the Bank had not languished before, and did not cease to occupy a
      front place in the attention of the principal of that establishment now.  In boastful proof of
      his promptitude and activity, as a remarkable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial
      wonder more admirable than Venus, who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea, he liked to
      show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour.  Consequently, in the first
      few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood, he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle, and
      every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery, that the officers
      who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed.</p>
     <p>They were at fault too, and off the scent.  Although they had been so quiet since the first
      outbreak of the matter, that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as
      hopeless, nothing new occurred.  No implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a
      self-betraying step.  More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the
      mysterious old woman remained a mystery.</p>
     <p>Things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it, the
      upshot of Mr. Bounderby’s investigations was, that he resolved to hazard a bold burst.  He
      drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool,
      suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described the said
      Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he could;
      he recited how he had left the town, and in what direction he had been last seen going; he had
      the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls to
      be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole
      population at one blow.</p>
     <p>The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of
      workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with
      eager eyes.  Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not
      read.  These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud — there was always
      some such ready to help them — stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe
      and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever
      be otherwise than threatening and full of evil.  Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of
      the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for
      hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as
      many readers as before.</p>
     <p>Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had
      obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket.  Oh, my friends and
      fellow-countrymen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and
      fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men, what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge
      unfolded what he called ‘that damning document,’ and held it up to the gaze, and for the
      execration of the working-man community!  ‘Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the
      camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union, is
      appropriately capable!  Oh, my prostrate friends, with the galling yoke of tyrants on your
      necks and the iron foot of despotism treading down your fallen forms into the dust of the
      earth, upon which right glad would your oppressors be to see you creeping on your bellies all
      the days of your lives, like the serpent in the garden — oh, my brothers, and shall I as a man
      not add, my sisters too, what do you say, <hi>now</hi>, of Stephen Blackpool, with a slight
      stoop in his shoulders and about five foot seven in height, as set forth in this degrading and
      disgusting document, this blighting bill, this pernicious placard, this abominable
      advertisement; and with what majesty of denouncement will you crush the viper, who would bring
      this stain and shame upon the God-like race that happily has cast him out for ever!  Yes, my
      compatriots, happily cast him out and sent him forth!  For you remember how he stood here
      before you on this platform; you remember how, face to face and foot to foot, I pursued him
      through all his intricate windings; you remember how he sneaked and slunk, and sidled, and
      splitted of straws, until, with not an inch of ground to which to cling, I hurled him out from
      amongst us: an object for the undying finger of scorn to point at, and for the avenging fire
      of every free and thinking mind to scorch and scar!  And now, my friends — my labouring
      friends, for I rejoice and triumph in that stigma — my friends whose hard but honest beds are
      made in toil, and whose scanty but independent pots are boiled in hardship; and now, I say, my
      friends, what appellation has that dastard craven taken to himself, when, with the mask torn
      from his features, he stands before us in all his native deformity, a What?  A thief!  A
      plunderer!  A proscribed fugitive, with a price upon his head; a fester and a wound upon the
      noble character of the Coketown operative!  Therefore, my band of brothers in a sacred bond,
      to which your children and your children’s children yet unborn have set their infant hands and
      seals, I propose to you on the part of the United Aggregate Tribunal, ever watchful for your
      welfare, ever zealous for your benefit, that this meeting does Resolve: That Stephen
      Blackpool, weaver, referred to in this placard, having been already solemnly disowned by the
      community of Coketown Hands, the same are free from the shame of his misdeeds, and cannot as a
      class be reproached with his dishonest actions!’</p>
     <p>Thus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort.  A few stern voices
      called out ‘No!’ and a score or two hailed, with assenting cries of ‘Hear, hear!’ the caution
      from one man, ‘Slackbridge, y’or over hetter in’t; y’or a goen too fast!’  But these were
      pigmies against an army; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to
      Slackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively panting at them.</p>
     <p>These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who
      had been called away from Louisa some minutes before, returned.</p>
     <p>‘Who is it?’ asked Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘It is Mr. Bounderby,’ said Sissy, timid of the name, ‘and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young
      woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you know her.’</p>
     <p>‘What do they want, Sissy dear?’</p>
     <p>‘They want to see you.  Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.’</p>
     <p>‘Father,’ said Louisa, for he was present, ‘I cannot refuse to see them, for a reason that
      will explain itself.  Shall they come in here?’</p>
     <p>As he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them.  She reappeared with them
      directly.  Tom was last; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room, near the
      door.</p>
     <p>‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ said her husband, entering with a cool nod, ‘I don’t disturb you, I hope. 
      This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has been making statements which
      render my visit necessary.  Tom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate
      reason or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, I am obliged to
      confront her with your daughter.’</p>
     <p>‘You have seen me once before, young lady,’ said Rachael, standing in front of Louisa.</p>
     <p>Tom coughed.</p>
     <p>‘You have seen me, young lady,’ repeated Rachael, as she did not answer, ‘once before.’</p>
     <p>Tom coughed again.</p>
     <p>‘I have.’</p>
     <p>Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby, and said, ‘Will you make it known,
      young lady, where, and who was there?’</p>
     <p>‘I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged, on the night of his discharge from his
      work, and I saw you there.  He was there too; and an old woman who did not speak, and whom I
      could scarcely see, stood in a dark corner.  My brother was with me.’</p>
     <p>‘Why couldn’t you say so, young Tom?’ demanded Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘I promised my sister I wouldn’t.’  Which Louisa hastily confirmed.  ‘And besides,’ said the
      whelp bitterly, ‘she tells her own story so precious well — and so full — that what business
      had I to take it out of her mouth!’</p>
     <p>‘Say, young lady, if you please,’ pursued Rachael, ‘why, in an evil hour, you ever came to
      Stephen’s that night.’</p>
     <p>‘I felt compassion for him,’ said Louisa, her colour deepening, ‘and I wished to know what
      he was going to do, and wished to offer him assistance.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, ma’am,’ said Bounderby.  ‘Much flattered and obliged.’</p>
     <p>‘Did you offer him,’ asked Rachael, ‘a bank-note?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds in gold.’</p>
     <p>Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again.</p>
     <p>‘Oh, certainly!’ said Bounderby.  ‘If you put the question whether your ridiculous and
      improbable account was true or not, I am bound to say it’s confirmed.’</p>
     <p>‘Young lady,’ said Rachael, ‘Stephen Blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all
      over this town, and where else!  There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken
      of in the same shameful way.  Stephen!  The honestest lad, the truest lad, the best!’  Her
      indignation failed her, and she broke off sobbing.</p>
     <p>‘I am very, very sorry,’ said Louisa.</p>
     <p>‘Oh, young lady, young lady,’ returned Rachael, ‘I hope you may be, but I don’t know!  I
      can’t say what you may ha’ done!  The like of you don’t know us, don’t care for us, don’t
      belong to us.  I am not sure why you may ha’ come that night.  I can’t tell but what you may
      ha’ come wi’ some aim of your own, not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor
      lad.  I said then, Bless you for coming; and I said it of my heart, you seemed to take so
      pitifully to him; but I don’t know now, I don’t know!’</p>
     <p>Louisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspicions; she was so faithful to her idea of
      the man, and so afflicted.</p>
     <p>‘And when I think,’ said Rachael through her sobs, ‘that the poor lad was so grateful,
      thinkin you so good to him — when I mind that he put his hand over his hard-worken face to
      hide the tears that you brought up there — Oh, I hope you may be sorry, and ha’ no bad cause
      to be it; but I don’t know, I don’t know!’</p>
     <p>‘You’re a pretty article,’ growled the whelp, moving uneasily in his dark corner, ‘to come
      here with these precious imputations!  You ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to
      behave yourself, and you would be by rights.’</p>
     <p>She said nothing in reply; and her low weeping was the only sound that was heard, until Mr.
      Bounderby spoke.</p>
     <p>‘Come!’ said he, ‘you know what you have engaged to do.  You had better give your mind to
      that; not this.’</p>
     <p>‘’Deed, I am loath,’ returned Rachael, drying her eyes, ‘that any here should see me like
      this; but I won’t be seen so again.  Young lady, when I had read what’s put in print of
      Stephen — and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you — I went
      straight to the Bank to say I knew where Stephen was, and to give a sure and certain promise
      that he should be here in two days.  I couldn’t meet wi’ Mr. Bounderby then, and your brother
      sent me away, and I tried to find you, but you was not to be found, and I went back to work. 
      Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night, I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen — for I
      know wi’ pride he will come back to shame it! — and then I went again to seek Mr. Bounderby,
      and I found him, and I told him every word I knew; and he believed no word I said, and brought
      me here.’</p>
     <p>‘So far, that’s true enough,’ assented Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets and his
      hat on.  ‘But I have known you people before to-day, you’ll observe, and I know you never die
      for want of talking.  Now, I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing. 
      You have undertaken to do something; all I remark upon that at present is, do it!’</p>
     <p>‘I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I have written to
      him once before sin’ he went away,’ said Rachael; ‘and he will be here, at furthest, in two
      days.’</p>
     <p>‘Then, I’ll tell you something.  You are not aware perhaps,’ retorted Mr. Bounderby, ‘that
      you yourself have been looked after now and then, not being considered quite free from
      suspicion in this business, on account of most people being judged according to the company
      they keep.  The post-office hasn’t been forgotten either.  What I’ll tell you is, that no
      letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.  Therefore, what has become of yours, I
      leave you to guess.  Perhaps you’re mistaken, and never wrote any.’</p>
     <p>‘He hadn’t been gone from here, young lady,’ said Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa,
      ‘as much as a week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from him, saying that he was
      forced to seek work in another name.’</p>
     <p>‘Oh, by George!’ cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, ‘he changes his name,
      does he!  That’s rather unlucky, too, for such an immaculate chap.  It’s considered a little
      suspicious in Courts of Justice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.’</p>
     <p>‘What,’ said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, ‘what, young lady, in the name of
      Mercy, was left the poor lad to do!  The masters against him on one hand, the men against him
      on the other, he only wantin to work hard in peace, and do what he felt right.  Can a man have
      no soul of his own, no mind of his own?  Must he go wrong all through wi’ this side, or must
      he go wrong all through wi’ that, or else be hunted like a hare?’</p>
     <p>‘Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,’ returned Louisa; ‘and I hope that he will clear
      himself.’</p>
     <p>‘You need have no fear of that, young lady.  He is sure!’</p>
     <p>‘All the surer, I suppose,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘for your refusing to tell where he is? 
      Eh?’</p>
     <p>‘He shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi’ the unmerited reproach of being
      brought back.  He shall come back of his own accord to clear himself, and put all those that
      have injured his good character, and he not here for its defence, to shame.  I have told him
      what has been done against him,’ said Rachael, throwing off all distrust as a rock throws of
      the sea, ‘and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.’</p>
     <p>‘Notwithstanding which,’ added Mr. Bounderby, ‘if he can be laid hold of any sooner, he
      shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself.  As to you, I have nothing against you;
      what you came and told me turns out to be true, and I have given you the means of proving it
      to be true, and there’s an end of it.  I wish you good night all!  I must be off to look a
      little further into this.’</p>
     <p>Tom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved, moved with him, kept close to him, and
      went away with him.  The only parting salutation of which he delivered himself was a sulky
      ‘Good night, father!’  With a brief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.</p>
     <p>Since his sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of speech.  He still
      sat silent, when Louisa mildly said:</p>
     <p>‘Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.’</p>
     <p>‘It goes against me,’ Rachael answered, in a gentler manner, ‘to mistrust any one; but when
      I am so mistrusted — when we all are — I cannot keep such things quite out of my mind.  I ask
      your pardon for having done you an injury.  I don’t think what I said now.  Yet I might come
      to think it again, wi’ the poor lad so wronged.’</p>
     <p>‘Did you tell him in your letter,’ inquired Sissy, ‘that suspicion seemed to have fallen
      upon him, because he had been seen about the Bank at night?  He would then know what he would
      have to explain on coming back, and would be ready.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, dear,’ she returned; ‘but I can’t guess what can have ever taken him there.  He never
      used to go there.  It was never in his way.  His way was the same as mine, and not near
      it.’</p>
     <p>Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and whether she might come
      to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him.</p>
     <p>‘I doubt,’ said Rachael, ‘if he can be here till next day.’</p>
     <p>‘Then I will come next night too,’ said Sissy.</p>
     <p>When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head, and said to his
      daughter:</p>
     <p>‘Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man.  Do you believe him to be
      implicated?’</p>
     <p>‘I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  I do not believe it
      now.’</p>
     <p>‘That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him to be
      suspected.  His appearance and manner; are they so honest?’</p>
     <p>‘Very honest.’</p>
     <p>‘And her confidence not to be shaken!  I ask myself,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, ‘does the
      real culprit know of these accusations?  Where is he?  Who is he?’</p>
     <p>His hair had latterly began to change its colour.  As he leaned upon his hand again, looking
      gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close
      at his side.  Her eyes by accident met Sissy’s at the moment.  Sissy flushed and started, and
      Louisa put her finger on her lip.</p>
     <p>Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not come, she told it
      in a whisper.  Next night again, when she came home with the same account, and added that he
      had not been heard of, she spoke in the same low frightened tone.  From the moment of that
      interchange of looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor ever
      pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it.</p>
     <p>The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and Stephen Blackpool was not
      come, and remained unheard of.  On the fourth day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but
      considering her despatch to have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from
      him with his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles
      away.  Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town looked for Stephen to be brought
      in next day.</p>
     <p>During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his shadow, assisting
      in all the proceedings.  He was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit his nails down to the
      quick, spoke in a hard rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.  At the
      hour when the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station; offering to wager
      that he had made off before the
      <pb n=" 193"/>arrival of those who were sent in quest of him, and that he would not
      appear.</p>
     <p>The whelp was right.  The messengers returned alone.  Rachael’s letter had gone, Rachael’s
      letter had been delivered.  Stephen Blackpool had decamped in that same hour; and no soul knew
      more of him.  The only doubt in Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith,
      believing that he really would come back, or warning him to fly.  On this point opinion was
      divided.</p>
     <p>Six days, seven days, far on into another week.  The wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly
      courage, and began to grow defiant.  ‘<hi>Was</hi> the suspected fellow the thief?  A pretty
      question!  If not, where was the man, and why did he not come back?’</p>
     <p>Where was the man, and why did he not come back?  In the dead of night the echoes of his own
      words, which had rolled Heaven knows how far away in the daytime, came back instead, and
      abided by him until morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER V FOUND</head>
     <p>Day and night again, day and night again.  No Stephen Blackpool.  Where was the
      man, and why did he not come back?</p>
     <p>Every night, Sissy went to Rachael’s lodging, and sat with her in her small neat room.  All
      day, Rachael toiled as such people must toil, whatever their anxieties.  The smoke-serpents
      were indifferent who was lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad
      elephants, like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever happened. 
      Day and night again, day and night again.  The monotony was unbroken.  Even Stephen
      Blackpool’s disappearance was falling into the general way, and becoming as monotonous a
      wonder as any piece of machinery in Coketown.</p>
     <p>‘I misdoubt,’ said Rachael, ‘if there is as many as twenty left in all this place, who have
      any trust in the poor dear lad now.’</p>
     <p>She said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the lamp at the street
      corner.  Sissy had come there when it was already dark, to await her return from work; and
      they had since sat at the window where Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to
      shine on their sorrowful talk.</p>
     <p>‘If it hadn’t been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to speak to,’ pursued
      Rachael, ‘times are, when I think my mind would not have kept right.  But I get hope and
      strength through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be
      proved clear?’</p>
     <p>‘I do believe so,’ returned Sissy, ‘with my whole heart.  I feel so certain, Rachael, that
      the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I
      have no more doubt of him than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you
      have.’</p>
     <p>‘And I, my dear,’ said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, ‘have known him through them
      all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to everything honest and good, that if he
      was never to be heard of more, and I was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with
      my last breath, God knows my heart.  I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!’</p>
     <p>‘We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will be freed from suspicion, sooner or
      later.’</p>
     <p>‘The better I know it to be so believed there, my dear,’ said Rachael, ‘and the kinder I
      feel it that you come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and keep me company, and be
      seen wi’ me when I am not yet free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I
      should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.  And yet I — ’</p>
     <p>‘You don’t mistrust her now, Rachael?’</p>
     <p>‘Now that you have brought us more together, no.  But I can’t at all times keep out of my
      mind — ’</p>
     <p>Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy, sitting by her
      side, was obliged to listen with attention.</p>
     <p>‘I can’t at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one.  I can’t think who
      ’tis, I can’t think how or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has put Stephen
      out of the way.  I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself
      innocent before them all, some one would be confounded, who — to prevent that — has stopped
      him, and put him out of the way.’</p>
     <p>‘That is a dreadful thought,’ said Sissy, turning pale.</p>
     <p>‘It <hi>is</hi> a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered.’</p>
     <p>Sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet.</p>
     <p>‘When it makes its way into my mind, dear,’ said Rachael, ‘and it will come sometimes,
      though I do all I can to keep it out, wi’ counting on to high numbers as I work, and saying
      over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a child — I fall into such a wild, hot
      hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.  I must get the better
      of this before bed-time.  I’ll walk home wi’ you.’</p>
     <p>‘He might fall ill upon the journey back,’ said Sissy, faintly offering a worn-out scrap of
      hope; ‘and in such a case, there are many places on the road where he might stop.’</p>
     <p>‘But he is in none of them.  He has been sought for in all, and he’s not there.’</p>
     <p>‘True,’ was Sissy’s reluctant admission.</p>
     <p>‘He’d walk the journey in two days.  If he was footsore and couldn’t walk, I sent him, in
      the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should have none of his own to spare.’</p>
     <p>‘Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better, Rachael.  Come into the air!’</p>
     <p>Her gentle hand adjusted Rachael’s shawl upon her shining black hair in the usual manner of
      her wearing it, and they went out.  The night being fine, little knots of Hands were here and
      there lingering at street corners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them, and
      there were but few people in the streets.</p>
     <p>‘You’re not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand is cooler.’</p>
     <p>‘I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a little fresh.  ‘Times when I can’t, I
      turn weak and confused.’</p>
     <p>‘But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may be wanted at any time to stand by
      Stephen.  To-morrow is Saturday.  If no news comes to-morrow, let us walk in the country on
      Sunday morning, and strengthen you for another week.  Will you go?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, dear.’</p>
     <p>They were by this time in the street where Mr. Bounderby’s house stood.  The way to Sissy’s
      destination led them past the door, and they were going straight towards it.  Some train had
      newly arrived in Coketown, which had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a
      considerable bustle about the town.  Several coaches were rattling before them and behind them
      as they approached Mr. Bounderby’s, and one of the latter drew up with such briskness as they
      were in the act of passing the house, that they looked round involuntarily.  The bright
      gaslight over Mr. Bounderby’s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of
      excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called
      to them to stop.</p>
     <p>‘It’s a coincidence,’ exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the coachman.  ‘It’s a
      Providence!  Come out, ma’am!’ then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside, ‘come out, or we’ll
      have you dragged out!’</p>
     <p>Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.  Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently
      collared.</p>
     <p>‘Leave her alone, everybody!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy.  ‘Let nobody touch
      her.  She belongs to me.  Come in, ma’am!’ then said Mrs. Sparsit, reversing her former word
      of command.  ‘Come in, ma’am, or we’ll have you dragged in!’</p>
     <p>The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient woman by the throat,
      and hauling her into a dwelling-house, would have been under any circumstances, sufficient
      temptation to all true English stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that
      dwelling-house and see the matter out.  But when the phenomenon was enhanced by the notoriety
      and mystery by this time associated all over the town with the Bank robbery, it would have
      lured the stragglers in, with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to
      fall upon their heads.  Accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground, consisting of the
      busiest of the neighbours to the number of some five-and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and
      Rachael, as they closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a
      disorderly irruption into Mr. Bounderby’s dining-room, where the people behind lost not a
      moment’s time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the people in front.</p>
     <p>‘Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Rachael, young woman; you know who this
      is?’</p>
     <p>‘It’s Mrs. Pegler,’ said Rachael.</p>
     <p>‘I should think it is!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting.  ‘Fetch Mr. Bounderby.  Stand away,
      everybody!’  Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling herself up, and shrinking from observation,
      whispered a word of entreaty.  ‘Don’t tell me,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud.  ‘I have told you
      twenty times, coming along, that I will <hi>not</hi> leave you till I have handed you over to
      him myself.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp, with whom he had
      been holding conference up-stairs.  Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than hospitable, at
      sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room.</p>
     <p>‘Why, what’s the matter now!’ said he.  ‘Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am?’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ explained that worthy woman, ‘I trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you
      have much desired to find.  Stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind, sir, and connecting
      together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be
      supposed to reside, as have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now present
      to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring that person with me — I need
      not say most unwillingly on her part.  It has not been, sir, without some trouble that I have
      effected this; but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold a
      real gratification.’</p>
     <p>Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby’s visage exhibited an extraordinary combination
      of all possible colours and expressions of discomfiture, as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to
      his view.</p>
     <p>‘Why, what do you mean by this?’ was his highly unexpected demand, in great warmth.  ‘I ask
      you, what do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am?’</p>
     <p>‘Sir!’ exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly.</p>
     <p>‘Why don’t you mind your own business, ma’am?’ roared Bounderby.  ‘How dare you go and poke
      your officious nose into my family affairs?’</p>
     <p>This allusion to her favourite feature overpowered Mrs. Sparsit.  She sat down stiffly in a
      chair, as if she were frozen; and with a fixed stare at Mr. Bounderby, slowly grated her
      mittens against one another, as if they were frozen too.</p>
     <p>‘My dear Josiah!’ cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling.  ‘My darling boy!  I am not to blame.  It’s
      not my fault, Josiah.  I told this lady over and over again, that I knew she was doing what
      would not be agreeable to you, but she would do it.’</p>
     <p>‘What did you let her bring you for?  Couldn’t you knock her cap off, or her tooth out, or
      scratch her, or do something or other to her?’ asked Bounderby.</p>
     <p>‘My own boy!  She threatened me that if I resisted her, I should be brought by constables,
      and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a’ — Mrs. Pegler glanced timidly
      but proudly round the walls — ‘such a fine house as this.  Indeed, indeed, it is not my
      fault!  My dear, noble, stately boy!  I have always lived quiet, and secret, Josiah, my dear. 
      I have never broken the condition once.  I have never said I was your mother.  I have admired
      you at a distance; and if I have come to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a
      proud peep at you, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away again.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in impatient mortification up and down
      at the side of the long dining-table, while the spectators greedily took in every syllable of
      Mrs. Pegler’s appeal, and at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.  Mr.
      Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr. Gradgrind addressed that
      maligned old lady:</p>
     <p>‘I am surprised, madam,’ he observed with severity, ‘that in your old age you have the face
      to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.’</p>
     <p>‘<hi>Me</hi> unnatural!’ cried poor old Mrs. Pegler.  ‘<hi>Me</hi> inhuman!  To my dear
      boy?’</p>
     <p>‘Dear!’ repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say. 
      Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his infancy, and left him to the brutality of
      a drunken grandmother.’</p>
     <p>‘<hi>I</hi> deserted my Josiah!’ cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her hands.  ‘Now, Lord forgive
      you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal against the memory of my poor
      mother, who died in my arms before Josiah was born.  May you repent of it, sir, and live to
      know better!’</p>
     <p>She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the possibility which
      dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone:</p>
     <p>‘Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to — to be brought up in the gutter?’</p>
     <p>‘Josiah in the gutter!’ exclaimed Mrs. Pegler.  ‘No such a thing, sir.  Never!  For shame on
      you!  My dear boy knows, and will give <hi>you</hi> to know, that though he come of humble
      parents, he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could, and never thought it
      hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful, and I’ve his
      books at home to show it!  Aye, have I!’ said Mrs. Pegler, with indignant pride.  ‘And my dear
      boy knows, and will give <hi>you</hi> to know, sir, that after his beloved father died, when
      he was eight years old, his mother, too, could pinch a bit, as it was her duty and her
      pleasure and her pride to do it, to help him out in life, and put him ’prentice.  And a steady
      lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend him a hand, and well he worked his own way
      forward to be rich and thriving.  And <hi>I</hi>’ll give you to know, sir — for this my dear
      boy won’t — that though his mother kept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but
      pensioned me on thirty pound a year — more than I want, for I put by out of it — only making
      the condition that I was to keep down in my own part, and make no boasts about him, and not
      trouble him.  And I never have, except with looking at him once a year, when he has never
      knowed it.  And it’s right,’ said poor old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, ‘that I
       <hi>should</hi> keep down in my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do
      a many unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride in my Josiah to
      myself, and I can love for love’s own sake!  And I am ashamed of you, sir,’ said Mrs. Pegler,
      lastly, ‘for your slanders and suspicions.  And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to
      stand here when my dear son said no.  And I shouldn’t be here now, if it hadn’t been for being
      brought here.  And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad mother to my
      son, with my son standing here to tell you so different!’</p>
     <p>The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs.
      Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament,
      when Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled
      larger and larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.</p>
     <p>‘I don’t exactly know,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘how I come to be favoured with the attendance
      of the present company, but I don’t inquire.  When they’re quite satisfied, perhaps they’ll be
      so good as to disperse; whether they’re satisfied or not, perhaps they’ll be so good as to
      disperse.  I’m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I have not undertaken to
      do it, and I’m not a going to do it.  Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon
      that branch of the subject, will be disappointed — particularly Tom Gradgrind, and he can’t
      know it too soon.  In reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a mistake made, concerning
      my mother.  If there hadn’t been over-officiousness it wouldn’t have been made, and I hate
      over-officiousness at all times, whether or no. Good evening!’</p>
     <p>Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door open for the company
      to depart, there was a blustering sheepishness upon him, at once extremely crestfallen and
      superlatively absurd.  Detected as the Bully of humility, who had built his windy reputation
      upon lies, and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had
      advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to a pedigree, he cut a most
      ridiculous figure.  With the people filing off at the door he held, who he knew would carry
      what had passed to the whole town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a
      Bully more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  Even that unlucky female, Mrs.
      Sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond, was not in so bad
      a plight as that remarkable man and self-made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.</p>
     <p>Rachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son’s for that night, walked
      together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted.  Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they
      had gone very far, and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool; for whom he thought this
      signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.</p>
     <p>As to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he had stuck close to
      Bounderby.  He seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without his
      knowledge, he was so far safe.  He never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since
      she went home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby, as already
      related.</p>
     <p>There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister’s mind, to which she never gave
      utterance, which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery.  The
      same dark possibility had presented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day, to
      Sissy, when Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen’s return, having put
      him out of the way.  Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her brother in
      connexion with the robbery, she and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that
      one interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on his hand; but it
      was understood between them, and they both knew it.  This
      <pb n=" 200"/>other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly
      shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far less of its being near the
      other.</p>
     <p>And still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up, throve with him.  If Stephen
      Blackpool was not the thief, let him show himself.  Why didn’t he?</p>
     <p>Another night.  Another day and night.  No Stephen Blackpool.  Where was the man, and why
      did he not come back?</p>

     <head>CHAPTER VI THE STARLIGHT</head>
     <p>The Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in the morning
      Sissy and Rachael met, to walk in the country.</p>
     <p>As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood’s too — after the
      manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into
      sackcloth — it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air,
      which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to get a few miles away by
      the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their lounge in the fields.  Sissy and Rachael
      helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about
      midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby’s retreat.</p>
     <p>Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal, it was green
      elsewhere, and there were trees to see, and there were larks singing (though it was Sunday),
      and there were pleasant scents in the air, and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky.  In
      the distance one way, Coketown showed as a black mist; in another distance hills began to
      rise; in a third, there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the
      far-off sea.  Under their feet, the grass was fresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered
      upon it, and speckled it; hedgerows were luxuriant; everything was at peace.  Engines at pits’
      mouths, and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily labour into the ground,
      were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short space to turn; and the great wheel of earth
      seemed to revolve without the shocks and noises of another time.</p>
     <p>They walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes, sometimes getting over a fragment
      of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch of the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of
      bricks and beams overgrown with grass, marking the site of deserted works.  They followed
      paths and tracks, however slight.  Mounds where the grass was rank and high, and where
      brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly heaped together, they always
      avoided; for dismal stories were told in that country of the old pits hidden beneath such
      indications.</p>
     <p>The sun was high when they sat down to rest.  They had seen no one, near or distant, for a
      long time; and the solitude remained unbroken.  ‘It is so still here, Rachael, and the way is
      so untrodden, that I think we must be the first who have been here all the summer.’</p>
     <p>As Sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten fragments of fence upon
      the ground.  She got up to look at it.  ‘And yet I don’t know.  This has not been broken very
      long.  The wood is quite fresh where it gave way.  Here are footsteps too. — O Rachael!’</p>
     <p>She ran back, and caught her round the neck.  Rachael had already started up.</p>
     <p>‘What is the matter?’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t know.  There is a hat lying in the grass.’  They went forward together.  Rachael
      took it up, shaking from head to foot.  She broke into a passion of tears and lamentations:
      Stephen Blackpool was written in his own hand on the inside.</p>
     <p>‘O the poor lad, the poor lad!  He has been made away with.  He is lying murdered here!’</p>
     <p>‘Is there — has the hat any blood upon it?’ Sissy faltered.</p>
     <p>They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of violence, inside or
      out.  It had been lying there some days, for rain and dew had stained it, and the mark of its
      shape was on the grass where it had fallen.  They looked fearfully about them, without moving,
      but could see nothing more.  ‘Rachael,’ Sissy whispered, ‘I will go on a little by
      myself.’</p>
     <p>She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when Rachael caught her
      in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape.  Before them, at their very
      feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.  They sprang back, and
      fell upon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other’s neck.</p>
     <p>‘O, my good Lord!  He’s down there!  Down there!’  At first this, and her terrific screams,
      were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any prayers, by any representations,
      by any means.  It was impossible to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she
      would have flung herself down the shaft.</p>
     <p>‘Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these dreadful cries! 
      Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!’</p>
     <p>By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment,
      Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone.</p>
     <p>‘Rachael, Stephen may be living.  You wouldn’t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this
      dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?’</p>
     <p>‘No, no, no!’</p>
     <p>‘Don’t stir from here, for his sake!  Let me go and listen.’</p>
     <p>She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands and knees, and
      called to him as loud as she could call.  She listened, but no sound replied.  She called
      again and listened; still no answering sound.  She did this, twenty, thirty times.  She took a
      little clod of earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in.  She could
      not hear it fall.</p>
     <p>The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago, almost carried
      despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all round her, seeing no help.  ‘Rachael,
      we must lose not a moment.  We must go in different directions, seeking aid.  You shall go by
      the way we have come, and I will go forward by the path.  Tell any one you see, and every one
      what has happened.  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!’</p>
     <p>She knew by Rachael’s face that she might trust her now.  And after standing for a moment to
      see her running, wringing her hands as she ran, she turned and went upon her own search; she
      stopped at the hedge to tie her shawl there as a guide to the place, then threw her bonnet
      aside, and ran as she had never run before.</p>
     <p>Run, Sissy, run, in Heaven’s name!  Don’t stop for breath.  Run, run!  Quickening herself by
      carrying such entreaties in her thoughts, she ran from field to field, and lane to lane, and
      place to place, as she had never run before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house,
      where two men lay in the shade, asleep on straw.</p>
     <p>First to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and breathless as she was, what had
      brought her there, were difficulties; but they no sooner understood her than their spirits
      were on fire like hers.  One of the men was in a drunken slumber, but on his comrade’s
      shouting to him that a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he started out to a pool of
      dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober.</p>
     <p>With these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that one to another,
      while they ran elsewhere.  Then a horse was found; and she got another man to ride for life or
      death to the railroad, and send a message to Louisa, which she wrote and gave him.  By this
      time a whole village was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all things
      necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place, to be carried to the Old
      Hell Shaft.</p>
     <p>It seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in the grave where he
      had been buried alive.  She could not bear to remain away from it any longer — it was like
      deserting him — and she hurried swiftly back, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including
      the drunken man whom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all.  When they came to
      the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had left it.  The men called and listened
      as she had done, and examined the edge of the chasm, and settled how it had happened, and then
      sat down to wait until the implements they wanted should come up.</p>
     <p>Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every whisper among these
      men, made Sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry at the bottom of the pit.  But the wind
      blew idly over it, and no sound arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and
      waiting.  After they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the accident
      began to come up; then the real help of implements began to arrive.  In the midst of this,
      Rachael returned; and with her party there was a surgeon, who brought some wine and
      medicines.  But, the expectation among the people that the man would be found alive was very
      slight indeed.</p>
     <p>There being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man put himself at the
      head of the rest, or was put there by the general consent, and made a large ring round the Old
      Hell Shaft, and appointed men to keep it.  Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work,
      only Sissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in the day, when
      the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr. Gradgrind and Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and
      the whelp, were also there.</p>
     <p>The sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had first sat down upon the grass,
      before a means of enabling two men to descend securely was rigged with poles and ropes. 
      Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had
      been found wanting, and messages had had to go and return.  It was five o’clock in the
      afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent down to try the air, while
      three or four rough faces stood crowded close together, attentively watching it: the man at
      the windlass lowering as they were told.  The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and
      then some water was cast in.  Then the bucket was hooked on; and the sobered man and another
      got in with lights, giving the word ‘Lower away!’</p>
     <p>As the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass creaked, there was not a breath
      among the one or two hundred men and women looking on, that came as it was wont to come.  The
      signal was given and the windlass stopped, with abundant rope to spare.  Apparently so long an
      interval ensued with the men at the windlass standing idle, that some women shrieked that
      another accident had happened!  But the surgeon who held the watch, declared five minutes not
      to have elapsed yet, and sternly admonished them to keep silence.  He had not well done
      speaking, when the windlass was reversed and worked again.  Practised eyes knew that it did
      not go as heavily as it would if both workmen had been coming up, and that only one was
      returning.</p>
     <p>The rope came in tight and strained; and ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the
      windlass, and all eyes were fastened on the pit.  The sobered man was brought up and leaped
      out briskly on the grass.  There was an universal cry of ‘Alive or dead?’ and then a deep,
      profound hush.</p>
     <p>When he said ‘Alive!’ a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in them.</p>
     <p>‘But he’s hurt very bad,’ he added, as soon as he could make himself heard again.  ‘Where’s
      doctor?  He’s hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno how to get him up.’</p>
     <p>They all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the surgeon, as he asked some
      questions, and shook his head on receiving the replies.  The sun was setting now; and the red
      light in the evening sky touched every face there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all
      its rapt suspense.</p>
     <p>The consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass, and the pitman going down
      again, carrying the wine and some other small matters with him.  Then the other man came up. 
      In the meantime, under the surgeon’s directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which others
      made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw, while he himself contrived some
      bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs.  As these were made, they were hung upon an
      arm of the pitman who had last come up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood,
      shown by the light he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles, and
      sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon the people, he was not the
      least conspicuous figure in the scene.  It was dark now, and torches were kindled.</p>
     <p>It appeared from the little this man said to those about him, which was quickly repeated all
      over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a mass of crumbled rubbish with which the
      pit was half choked up, and that his fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the
      side.  He lay upon his back with one arm doubled under him, and according to his own belief
      had hardly stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his free hand to a side pocket, in
      which he remembered to have some bread and meat (of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had
      likewise scooped up a little water in it now and then.  He had come straight away from his
      work, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on his way to Mr.
      Bounderby’s country house after dark, when he fell.  He was crossing that dangerous country at
      such a dangerous time, because he was innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn’t
      rest from coming the nearest way to deliver himself up.  The Old Hell Shaft, the pitman said,
      with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the last; for though Stephen could speak
      now, he believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him.</p>
     <p>When all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried charges from his comrades and
      the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him, disappeared into the pit.  The rope
      went out as before, the signal was made as before, and the windlass stopped.  No man removed
      his hand from it now.  Every one waited with his grasp set, and his body bent down to the
      work, ready to reverse and wind in.  At length the signal was given, and all the ring leaned
      forward.</p>
     <p>For, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to its utmost as it appeared, and the men
      turned heavily, and the windlass complained.  It was scarcely endurable to look at the rope,
      and think of its giving way.  But, ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass
      safely, and the connecting chains appeared, and finally the bucket with the two men holding on
      at the sides — a sight to make the head swim, and oppress the heart — and tenderly supporting
      between them, slung and tied within, the figure of a poor, crushed, human creature.</p>
     <p>A low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept aloud, as this form, almost
      without form, was moved very slowly from its iron deliverance, and laid upon the bed of
      straw.  At first, none but the surgeon went close to it.  He did what he could in its
      adjustment on the couch, but the best that he could do was to cover it.  That gently done, he
      called to him Rachael and Sissy.  And at that time the pale, worn, patient face was seen
      looking up at the sky, with the broken right hand lying bare on the outside of the covering
      garments, as if waiting to be taken by another hand.</p>
     <p>They gave him drink, moistened his face with water, and administered some drops of cordial
      and wine.  Though he lay quite motionless looking up at the sky, he smiled and said,
      ‘Rachael.’  She stooped down on the grass at his side, and bent over him until her eyes were
      between his and the sky, for he could not so much as turn them to look at her.</p>
     <p>‘Rachael, my dear.’</p>
     <p>She took his hand.  He smiled again and said, ‘Don’t let ’t go.’</p>
     <p>‘Thou’rt in great pain, my own dear Stephen?’</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ been, but not now.  I ha’ been — dreadful, and dree, and
      <pb n=" 206"/>long, my dear — but ’tis ower now.  Ah, Rachael, aw a muddle!  Fro’ first to
      last, a muddle!’</p>
     <p>The spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the word.</p>
     <p>‘I ha’ fell into th’ pit, my dear, as have cost wi’in the knowledge o’ old fok now livin,
      hundreds and hundreds o’ men’s lives — fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an’
      thousands, an’ keeping ’em fro’ want and hunger.  I ha’ fell into a pit that ha’ been wi’ th’
      Firedamp crueller than battle.  I ha’ read on ’t in the public petition, as onny one may read,
      fro’ the men that works in pits, in which they ha’ pray’n and pray’n the lawmakers for
      Christ’s sake not to let their work be murder to ’em, but to spare ’em for th’ wives and
      children that they loves as well as gentlefok loves theirs.  When it were in work, it killed
      wi’out need; when ’tis let alone, it kills wi’out need.  See how we die an’ no need, one way
      an’ another — in a muddle — every day!’</p>
     <p>He faintly said it, without any anger against any one.  Merely as the truth.</p>
     <p>‘Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot her.  Thou’rt not like to forget her now,
      and me so nigh her.  Thou know’st — poor, patient, suff’rin, dear — how thou didst work for
      her, seet’n all day long in her little chair at thy winder, and how she died, young and
      misshapen, awlung o’ sickly air as had’n no need to be, an’ awlung o’ working people’s
      miserable homes.  A muddle!  Aw a muddle!’</p>
     <p>Louisa approached him; but he could not see her, lying with his face turned up to the night
      sky.</p>
     <p>‘If aw th’ things that tooches us, my dear, was not so muddled, I should’n ha’ had’n need to
      coom heer.  If we was not in a muddle among ourseln, I should’n ha’ been, by my own fellow
      weavers and workin’ brothers, so mistook.  If Mr. Bounderby had ever know’d me right — if he’d
      ever know’d me at aw — he would’n ha’ took’n offence wi’ me.  He would’n ha’ suspect’n me. 
      But look up yonder, Rachael!  Look aboove!’</p>
     <p>Following his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a star.</p>
     <p/>
     <p>‘It ha’ shined upon me,’ he said reverently, ‘in my pain and trouble down below.  It ha’
      shined into my mind.  I ha’ look’n at ’t and thowt o’ thee, Rachael, till the muddle in my
      mind have cleared awa, above a bit, I hope.  If soom ha’ been wantin’ in unnerstan’in me
      better, I, too, ha’ been wantin’ in unnerstan’in them better.  When I got thy letter, I easily
      believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me, and what her brother sen and done to me,
      was one, and that there were a wicked plot betwixt ’em.  When I fell, I were in anger wi’ her,
      an’ hurryin on t’ be as onjust t’ her as oothers was t’ me.  But in our judgments, like as in
      our doins, we mun bear and forbear.  In my pain an’ trouble, lookin up yonder, — wi’ it shinin
      on me — I ha’ seen more clear, and ha’ made it my dyin prayer that aw th’ world may on’y coom
      toogether more, an’ get a better unnerstan’in o’ one another, than when I were in ’t my own
      weak seln.’</p>
     <p>Louisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the opposite side to Rachael, so that he could
      see her.</p>
     <p>‘You ha’ heard?’ he said, after a few moments’ silence.  ‘I ha’ not forgot you, ledy.’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, Stephen, I have heard you.  And your prayer is mine.’</p>
     <p>‘You ha’ a father.  Will yo tak’ a message to him?’</p>
     <p>‘He is here,’ said Louisa, with dread.  ‘Shall I bring him to you?’</p>
     <p>‘If yo please.’</p>
     <p>Louisa returned with her father.  Standing hand-in-hand, they both looked down upon the
      solemn countenance.</p>
     <p>‘Sir, yo will clear me an’ mak my name good wi’ aw men.  This I leave to yo.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind was troubled and asked how?</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ was the reply: ‘yor son will tell yo how.  Ask him.  I mak no charges: I leave none
      ahint me: not a single word.  I ha’ seen an’ spok’n wi’ yor son, one night.  I ask no more o’
      yo than that yo clear me — an’ I trust to yo to do ’t.’</p>
     <p>The bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being anxious for his
      removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to go in front of the litter.  Before it
      was raised, and while they were arranging how to go, he said to Rachael, looking upward at the
      star:</p>
     <p>‘Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin’ on me down there in my trouble, I thowt it
      were the star as guided to Our Saviour’s home.  I awmust think it be the very star!’</p>
     <p>They lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to take him in the
      direction whither the star seemed to him to lead.</p>
     <p>‘Rachael, beloved lass!  Don’t let go my hand.  We may walk toogether t’night, my dear!’</p>
     <p>‘I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen, all the way.’</p>
     <p>‘Bless thee!  Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!’</p>
     <p>They carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and over the wide
      landscape; Rachael always holding the hand in hers.  Very few whispers broke the mournful
      silence.  It was soon a funeral procession.  The star had shown him where to find the God of
      the poor; and through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his Redeemer’s
      rest.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER VII WHELP-HUNTING</head>
     <p>Before the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken, one figure had
      disappeared from within it.  Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa, who held
      her father’s arm, but in a retired place by themselves.  When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to
      the couch, Sissy, attentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadow — a sight
      in the horror of his face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but one — and whispered
      in his ear.  Without turning his head, he conferred with her a few moments, and vanished. 
      Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved.</p>
     <p>When the father reached home, he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby’s, desiring his son to come
      to him directly.  The reply was, that Mr. Bounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing
      nothing of him since, had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge.</p>
     <p>‘I believe, father,’ said Louisa, ‘he will not come back to town to-night.’  Mr. Gradgrind
      turned away, and said no more.</p>
     <p>In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened, and seeing his
      son’s place empty (he had not the courage to look in at first) went back along the street to
      meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there.  To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain,
      but entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ his son at a
      distance for a little while.  Also, that he was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen
      Blackpool’s memory, and declaring the thief.  Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood
      stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense
      soap-bubble, without its beauty.</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that day.  When Sissy
      and Louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening it, ‘Not now, my dears; in the
      evening.’  On their return in the evening, he said, ‘I am not able yet — to-morrow.’  He ate
      nothing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at
      night.</p>
     <p>But, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took his usual place at
      the table.  Aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed down; and yet he looked a wiser man, and
      a better man, than in the days when in this life he wanted nothing — but Facts.  Before he
      left the room, he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head
      drooping, went away.</p>
     <p>‘Dear father,’ said Louisa, when they kept their appointment, ‘you have three young children
      left.  They will be different, I will be different yet, with Heaven’s help.’</p>
     <p>She gave her hand to Sissy, as if she meant with her help too.</p>
     <p>‘Your wretched brother,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Do you think he had planned this robbery,
      when he went with you to the lodging?’</p>
     <p>‘I fear so, father.  I know he had wanted money very much, and had spent a great deal.’</p>
     <p>‘The poor man being about to leave the town, it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion
      on him?’</p>
     <p>‘I think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there, father.  For I asked him to go
      there with me.  The visit did not originate with him.’</p>
     <p>‘He had some conversation with the poor man.  Did he take him aside?’</p>
     <p>‘He took him out of the room.  I asked him afterwards, why he had done so, and he made a
      plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and when I remember the circumstances by its
      light, I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them.’</p>
     <p>‘Let me know,’ said her father, ‘if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same
      dark view as mine.’</p>
     <p>‘I fear, father,’ hesitated Louisa, ‘that he must have made some representation to Stephen
      Blackpool — perhaps in my name, perhaps in his own — which induced him to do in good faith and
      honesty, what he had never done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights
      before he left the town.’</p>
     <p>‘Too plain!’ returned the father.  ‘Too plain!’</p>
     <p>He shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments.  Recovering himself, he said:</p>
     <p>‘And now, how is he to be found?  How is he to be saved from justice?  In the few hours that
      I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and
      only by us?  Ten thousand pounds could not effect it.’</p>
     <p>‘Sissy has effected it, father.’</p>
     <p>He raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in his house, and said in a tone of
      softened gratitude and grateful kindness, ‘It is always you, my child!’</p>
     <p>‘We had our fears,’ Sissy explained, glancing at Louisa, ‘before yesterday; and when I saw
      you brought to the side of the litter last night, and heard what passed (being close to
      Rachael all the time), I went to him when no one saw, and said to him, “Don’t look at me.  See
      where your father is.  Escape at once, for his sake and your own!”  He was in a tremble before
      I whispered to him, and he started and trembled more then, and said, “Where can I go?  I have
      very little money, and I don’t know who will hide me!”  I thought of father’s old circus.  I
      have not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year, and I read of him in a paper
      only the other day.  I told him to hurry there, and tell his name, and ask Mr. Sleary to hide
      him till I came.  “I’ll get to him before the morning,” he said.  And I saw him shrink away
      among the people.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank Heaven!’ exclaimed his father.  ‘He may be got abroad yet.’</p>
     <p>It was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him was within three hours’
      journey of Liverpool, whence he could be swiftly dispatched to any part of the world.  But,
      caution being necessary in communicating with him — for there was a greater danger every
      moment of his being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr. Bounderby
      himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a Roman part — it was consented that
      Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in question, by a circuitous course, alone; and
      that the unhappy father, setting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same
      bourne by another and wider route.  It was further agreed that he should not present himself
      to Mr. Sleary, lest his intentions should be mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival
      should cause his son to take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to Sissy
      and Louisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery and disgrace, of
      his father’s being at hand and of the purpose for which they had come.  When these
      arrangements had been well considered and were fully understood by all three, it was time to
      begin to carry them into execution.  Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from
      his own house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel; and at
      night the remaining two set forth upon their different course, encouraged by not seeing any
      face they knew.</p>
     <p>The two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers of minutes, at
      branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down wells — which was the only variety of
      those branches — and, early in the morning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the
      town they sought.  From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old postilion, who
      happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so were smuggled into the town by all
      the back lanes where the pigs lived: which, although not a magnificent or even savoury
      approach, was, as is usual in such cases, the legitimate highway.</p>
     <p>The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of Sleary’s Circus.  The
      company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off, and had opened there last
      night.  The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling
      on that road was very slow.  Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and no rest (which it
      would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances), it was noon before they
      began to find the bills of Sleary’s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o’clock when they
      stopped in the market-place.</p>
     <p>A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour, was in course of
      announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones of the street.  Sissy
      recommended that, to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should
      present themselves to pay at the door.  If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he would be sure
      to know her, and would proceed with discretion.  If he were not, he would be sure to see them
      inside; and, knowing what he had done with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion
      still.</p>
     <p>Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered booth.  The flag
      with the inscription <hi>Sleary’s Horse-riding</hi> was there; and the Gothic niche was there;
      but Mr. Sleary was not there.  Master Kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received
      by the wildest credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of
      circumstances (and his beard), and, in the capacity of a man who made himself generally
      useful, presided on this occasion over the exchequer — having also a drum in reserve, on which
      to expend his leisure moments and superfluous forces.  In the extreme sharpness of his look
      out for base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw anything but money; so
      Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in.</p>
     <p>The Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black spots, was twirling
      five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do. 
      Sissy, though well acquainted with his Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present
      Emperor, and his reign was peaceful.  Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful
      Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown (who humorously said
      Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her in.</p>
     <p>Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash, and the Clown had
      only said, ‘If you do it again, I’ll throw the horse at you!’ when Sissy was recognised both
      by father and daughter.  But they got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr.
      Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive eye than
      into his fixed one.  The performance seemed a little long to Sissy and Louisa, particularly
      when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said ‘Indeed,
      sir!’ to all his observations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two
      legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs, and laid hold of one
      leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs, and threw ’em at four legs, who ran away
      with one leg.  For, although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged
      stool, a dog, and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great
      suspense.  At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her curtsey amid great
      applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had just warmed himself, and said, ‘Now
       <hi>I</hi>’ll have a turn!’ when Sissy was touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.</p>
     <p>She took Louisa with her; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private
      apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden ceiling all aslant, on which the box
      company stamped their approbation, as if they were coming through.  ‘Thethilia,’ said Mr.
      Sleary, who had brandy and water at hand, ‘it doth me good to thee you.  You wath alwayth a
      favourite with uth, and you’ve done uth credith thinth the old timeth I’m thure.  You mutht
      thee our people, my dear, afore we thpeak of bithnith, or they’ll break their hearth —
      ethpethially the women.  Here’th Jothphine hath been and got married to E. W. B. Childerth,
      and thee hath got a boy, and though he’th only three yearth old, he thtickth on to any pony
      you can bring againtht him.  He’th named The Little Wonder of Thcolathtic Equitation; and if
      you don’t hear of that boy at Athley’th, you’ll hear of him at Parith.  And you recollect
      Kidderminthter, that wath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf?  Well.  He’th married
      too.  Married a widder.  Old enough to be hith mother.  Thee wath Tightrope, thee wath, and
      now thee’th nothing — on accounth of fat.  They’ve got two children, tho we’re thtrong in the
      Fairy bithnith and the Nurthery dodge.  If you wath to thee our Children in the Wood, with
      their father and mother both a dyin’ on a horthe — their uncle a retheiving of ’em ath hith
      wardth, upon a horthe — themthelvth both a goin’ a black-berryin’ on a horthe — and the
      Robinth a coming in to cover ’em with leavth, upon a horthe — you’d thay it wath the
      completetht thing ath ever you thet your eyeth on!  And you remember Emma Gordon, my dear, ath
      wath a’motht a mother to you?  Of courthe you do; I needn’t athk.  Well!  Emma, thee lotht her
      huthband.  He wath throw’d a heavy back-fall off a Elephant in a thort of a Pagoda thing ath
      the Thultan of the Indieth, and he never got the better of it; and thee married a thecond time
      — married a Cheethemonger ath fell in love with her from the front — and he’th a Overtheer and
      makin’ a fortun.’</p>
     <p>These various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath now, related with great heartiness,
      and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old
      veteran he was.  Afterwards he brought in Josephine, and E. W. B. Childers (rather deeply
      lined in the jaws by daylight), and the Little Wonder of Scholastic Equitation, and in a word,
      all the company.  Amazing creatures they were in Louisa’s eyes, so white and pink of
      complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative of leg; but it was very agreeable to see
      them crowding about Sissy, and very natural in Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears.</p>
     <p>‘There!  Now Thethilia hath kithd all the children, and hugged all the women, and thaken
      handth all round with all the men, clear, every one of you, and ring in the band for the
      thecond part!’</p>
     <p>As soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.  ‘Now, Thethilia, I don’t athk to
      know any thecreth, but I thuppothe I may conthider thith to be Mith Thquire.’</p>
     <p>‘This is his sister.  Yes.’</p>
     <p>‘And t’other on’th daughter.  That’h what I mean.  Hope I thee you well, mith.  And I hope
      the Thquire’th well?’</p>
     <p>‘My father will be here soon,’ said Louisa, anxious to bring him to the point.  ‘Is my
      brother safe?’</p>
     <p>‘Thafe and thound!’ he replied.  ‘I want you jutht to take a peep at the Ring, mith, through
      here.  Thethilia, you know the dodgeth; find a thpy-hole for yourthelf.’</p>
     <p>They each looked through a chink in the boards.</p>
     <p>‘That’h Jack the Giant Killer — piethe of comic infant bithnith,’ said Sleary.  ‘There’th a
      property-houthe, you thee, for Jack to hide in; there’th my Clown with a thauthepan-lid and a
      thpit, for Jack’th thervant; there’th little Jack himthelf in a thplendid thoot of armour;
      there’th two comic black thervanth twithe ath big ath the houthe, to thtand by it and to bring
      it in and clear it; and the Giant (a very ecthpenthive bathket one), he an’t on yet.  Now, do
      you thee ’em all?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes,’ they both said.</p>
     <p>‘Look at ’em again,’ said Sleary, ‘look at ’em well.  You thee em all?  Very good.  Now,
      mith;’ he put a form for them to sit on; ‘I have my opinionth, and the Thquire your father
      hath hith.  I don’t want to know what your brother’th been up to; ith better for me not to
      know.  All I thay ith, the Thquire hath thtood by Thethilia, and I’ll thtand by the Thquire. 
      Your brother ith one them black thervanth.’</p>
     <p>Louisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress, partly of satisfaction.</p>
     <p>‘Ith a fact,’ said Sleary, ‘and even knowin’ it, you couldn’t put your finger on him.  Let
      the Thquire come.  I thall keep your brother here after the performanth.  I thant undreth him,
      nor yet wath hith paint off.  Let the Thquire come here after the performanth, or come here
      yourthelf after the performanth, and you thall find your brother, and have the whole plathe to
      talk to him in.  Never mind the lookth of him, ath long ath he’th well hid.’</p>
     <p>Louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained Mr. Sleary no longer then.  She
      left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of tears; and she and Sissy went away until
      later in the afternoon.</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.  He too had encountered no one whom he
      knew; and was now sanguine with Sleary’s assistance, of getting his disgraced son to Liverpool
      in the night.  As neither of the three could be his companion without almost identifying him
      under any disguise, he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust, beseeching
      him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or South America, or any distant part of the
      world to which he could be the most speedily and privately dispatched.</p>
     <p>This done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus to be quite vacated; not only by the
      audience, but by the company and by the horses.  After watching it a long time, they saw Mr.
      Sleary bring out a chair and sit down by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal
      that they might approach.</p>
     <p>‘Your thervant, Thquire,’ was his cautious salutation as they passed in.  ‘If you want me
      you’ll find me here.  You muthn’t mind your thon having a comic livery on.’</p>
     <p>They all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the Clown’s performing chair
      in the middle of the ring.  On one of the back benches, remote in the subdued light and the
      strangeness of the place, sat the villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he had the misery
      to call his son.</p>
     <p>In a preposterous coat, like a beadle’s, with cuffs and flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable
      extent; in an immense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled shoes, and a mad cocked hat; with
      nothing fitting him, and everything of coarse material, moth-eaten and full of holes; with
      seams in his black face, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed
      all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful as the whelp in his comic
      livery, Mr. Gradgrind never could by any other means have believed in, weighable and
      measurable fact though it was.  And one of his model children had come to this!</p>
     <p>At first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining up there by
      himself.  Yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly made can be called yielding, to
      the entreaties of Sissy — for Louisa he disowned altogether — he came down, bench by bench,
      until he stood in the sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within its
      limits from where his father sat.</p>
     <p>‘How was this done?’ asked the father.</p>
     <p>‘How was what done?’ moodily answered the son.</p>
     <p>‘This robbery,’ said the father, raising his voice upon the word.</p>
     <p>‘I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before I went away.  I had had the
      key that was found, made long before.  I dropped it that morning, that it might be supposed to
      have been used.  I didn’t take the money all at once.  I pretended to put my balance away
      every night, but I didn’t.  Now you know all about it.’</p>
     <p>‘If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,’ said the father, ‘it would have shocked me less than
      this!’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t see why,’ grumbled the son.  ‘So many people are employed in situations of trust;
      so many people, out of so many, will be dishonest.  I have heard you talk, a hundred times, of
      its being a law.  How can <hi>I</hi> help laws?  You have comforted others with such things,
      father.  Comfort yourself!’</p>
     <p>The father buried his face in his hands, and the son stood in his disgraceful grotesqueness,
      biting straw: his hands, with the black partly worn away inside, looking like the hands of a
      monkey.  The evening was fast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his
      eyes restlessly and impatiently towards his father.  They were the only parts of his face that
      showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was so thick.</p>
     <p>‘You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.’</p>
     <p>‘I suppose I must.  I can’t be more miserable anywhere,’ whimpered the whelp, ‘than I have
      been here, ever since I can remember.  That’s one thing.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind went to the door, and returned with Sleary, to whom he submitted the question,
      How to get this deplorable object away?</p>
     <p>‘Why, I’ve been thinking of it, Thquire.  There’th not muth time to lothe, tho you muth thay
      yeth or no.  Ith over twenty mileth to the rail.  There’th a coath in half an hour, that goeth
       <hi>to</hi> the rail, ‘purpothe to cath the mail train.  That train will take him right to
      Liverpool.’</p>
     <p>‘But look at him,’ groaned Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Will any coach — ’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t mean that he thould go in the comic livery,’ said Sleary.  ‘Thay the word, and I’ll
      make a Jothkin of him, out of the wardrobe, in five minutes.’</p>
     <p>‘I don’t understand,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘A Jothkin — a Carter.  Make up your mind quick, Thquire.  There’ll be beer to feth.  I’ve
      never met with nothing but beer ath’ll ever clean a comic blackamoor.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind rapidly assented; Mr. Sleary rapidly turned out from a box, a smock frock, a
      felt hat, and other essentials; the whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize;
      Mr. Sleary rapidly brought beer, and washed him white again.</p>
     <p>‘Now,’ said Sleary, ‘come along to the coath, and jump up behind; I’ll go with you there,
      and they’ll thuppothe you one of my people.  Thay farewell to your family, and tharp’th the
      word.’  With which he delicately retired.</p>
     <p>‘Here is your letter,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘All necessary means
      <pb n=" 216"/>will be provided for you.  Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the
      shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has led.  Give
      me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!’</p>
     <p>The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone.  But,
      when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh.</p>
     <p>‘Not you.  I don’t want to have anything to say to you!’</p>
     <p>‘O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!’</p>
     <p>‘After all your love!’ he returned, obdurately.  ‘Pretty love!  Leaving old Bounderby to
      himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the
      greatest danger.  Pretty love that!  Coming out with every word about our having gone to that
      place, when you saw the net was gathering round me.  Pretty love that!  You have regularly
      given me up.  You never cared for me.’</p>
     <p>‘Tharp’th the word!’ said Sleary, at the door.</p>
     <p>They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him, and loved him
      still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her
      last words, far away: when some one ran against them.  Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both
      before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.</p>
     <p>For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin nostrils distended, his
      white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself
      into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow.  There he stood, panting and
      heaving, as if he had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when he had run them down
      before.</p>
     <p>‘I’m sorry to interfere with your plans,’ said Bitzer, shaking his head, ‘but I can’t allow
      myself to be done by horse-riders.  I must have young Mr. Tom; he mustn’t be got away by
      horse-riders; here he is in a smock frock, and I must have him!’</p>
     <p>By the collar, too, it seemed.  For, so he took possession of him.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER VIII PHILOSOPHICAL</head>
     <p>They went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders out. 
      Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in the Ring, blinking at his
      old patron through the darkness of the twilight.</p>
     <p>‘Bitzer,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to him, ‘have you a
      heart?’</p>
     <p>‘The circulation, sir,’ returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the question, ‘couldn’t be
      carried on without one.  No man, sir, acquainted with the facts established by Harvey relating
      to the circulation of the blood, can doubt that I have a heart.’</p>
     <p>‘Is it accessible,’ cried Mr. Gradgrind, ‘to any compassionate influence?’</p>
     <p>‘It is accessible to Reason, sir,’ returned the excellent young man.  ‘And to nothing
      else.’</p>
     <p>They stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind’s face as white as the pursuer’s.</p>
     <p>‘What motive — even what motive in reason — can you have for preventing the escape of this
      wretched youth,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘and crushing his miserable father?  See his sister
      here.  Pity us!’</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner, ‘since you ask me what
      motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, it is only reasonable to
      let you know.  I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first.  I had had
      my eye upon him before that time, for I knew his ways.  I have kept my observations to myself,
      but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs against him now, besides his running away,
      and besides his own confession, which I was just in time to overhear.  I had the pleasure of
      watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  I am going to take young Mr.
      Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby.  Sir, I have no doubt
      whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom’s situation.  And I wish to
      have his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.’</p>
     <p>‘If this is solely a question of self-interest with you — ’ Mr. Gradgrind began.</p>
     <p>‘I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,’ returned Bitzer; ‘but I am sure you know that
      the whole social system is a question of self-interest.  What you must always appeal to, is a
      person’s self-interest.  It’s your only hold.  We are so constituted.  I was brought up in
      that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are aware.’</p>
     <p>‘What sum of money,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘will you set against your expected promotion?’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, sir,’ returned Bitzer, ‘for hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum
      against it.  Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the
      calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed,
      would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.’</p>
     <p>‘Bitzer,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would have said, See how
      miserable I am!  ‘Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you.  You were many years at my
      school.  If, in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in
      any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat and pray you to
      give him the benefit of that remembrance.’</p>
     <p>‘I really wonder, sir,’ rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative manner, ‘to find you
      taking a position so untenable.  My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came
      away, the bargain ended.’</p>
     <p>It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid
      for.  Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without
      purchase.  Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be. 
      Every inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain across a
      counter.  And if we didn’t get to Heaven that way, it was not a politico-economical place, and
      we had no business there.</p>
     <p>‘I don’t deny,’ added Bitzer, ‘that my schooling was cheap.  But that comes right, sir.  I
      was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose of myself in the dearest.’</p>
     <p>He was a little troubled here, by Louisa and Sissy crying.</p>
     <p>‘Pray don’t do that,’ said he, ‘it’s of no use doing that: it only worries.  You seem to
      think that I have some animosity against young Mr. Tom; whereas I have none at all.  I am only
      going, on the reasonable grounds I have mentioned, to take him back to Coketown.  If he was to
      resist, I should set up the cry of Stop thief!  But, he won’t resist, you may depend upon
      it.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Sleary, who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably jammed in his head as
      his fixed one, had listened to these doctrines with profound attention, here stepped
      forward.</p>
     <p>‘Thquire, you know perfectly well, and your daughter knowth perfectly well (better than you,
      becauthe I thed it to her), that I didn’t know what your thon had done, and that I didn’t want
      to know — I thed it wath better not, though I only thought, then, it wath thome thkylarking. 
      However, thith young man having made it known to be a robbery of a bank, why, that’h a
      theriouth thing; muth too theriouth a thing for me to compound, ath thith young man hath very
      properly called it.  Conthequently, Thquire, you muthn’t quarrel with me if I take thith young
      man’th thide, and thay he’th right and there’th no help for it.  But I tell you what I’ll do,
      Thquire; I’ll drive your thon and thith young man over to the rail, and prevent expothure
      here.  I can’t conthent to do more, but I’ll do that.’</p>
     <p>Fresh lamentations from Louisa, and deeper affliction on Mr. Gradgrind’s part, followed this
      desertion of them by their last friend.  But, Sissy glanced at him with great attention; nor
      did she in her own breast misunderstand him.  As they were all going out again, he favoured
      her with one slight roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.  As he locked the
      door, he said excitedly:</p>
     <p>‘The Thquire thtood by you, Thethilia, and I’ll thtand by the Thquire.  More than that:
      thith ith a prethiouth rathcal, and belongth to that bluthtering Cove that my people nearly
      pitht out o’ winder.  It’ll be a dark night; I’ve got a horthe that’ll do anything but thpeak;
      I’ve got a pony that’ll go fifteen mile an hour with Childerth driving of him; I’ve got a dog
      that’ll keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty hourth.  Get a word with the young Thquire. 
      Tell him, when he theeth our horthe begin to danthe, not to be afraid of being thpilt, but to
      look out for a pony-gig coming up.  Tell him, when he theeth that gig clothe by, to jump down,
      and it’ll take him off at a rattling pathe.  If my dog leth thith young man thtir a peg on
      foot, I give him leave to go.  And if my horthe ever thtirth from that thpot where he beginth
      a danthing, till the morning — I don’t know him? — Tharp’th the word!’</p>
     <p>The word was so sharp, that in ten minutes Mr. Childers, sauntering about the market-place
      in a pair of slippers, had his cue, and Mr. Sleary’s equipage was ready.  It was a fine sight,
      to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one
      practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions.  Soon after dark
      they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable creature) already pinning
      Bitzer with his eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for
      him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight.</p>
     <p>The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense.  At eight o’clock in the
      morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits.</p>
     <p>‘All right, Thquire!’ said Mr. Sleary, ‘your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time. 
      Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night.  The horthe
      danthed the polka till he wath dead beat (he would have walthed if he hadn’t been in harneth),
      and then I gave him the word and he went to thleep comfortable.  When that prethiouth young
      Rathcal thed he’d go for’ard afoot, the dog hung on to hith neck-hankercher with all four
      legth in the air and pulled him down and rolled him over.  Tho he come back into the drag, and
      there he that, ’till I turned the horthe’th head, at half-patht thixth thith morning.’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and hinted as delicately as he could,
      at a handsome remuneration in money.</p>
     <p>‘I don’t want money mythelf, Thquire; but Childerth ith a family man, and if you wath to
      like to offer him a five-pound note, it mightn’t be unactheptable.  Likewithe if you wath to
      thtand a collar for the dog, or a thet of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take
      ’em.  Brandy and water I alwayth take.’  He had already called for a glass, and now called for
      another.  ‘If you wouldn’t think it going too far, Thquire, to make a little thpread for the
      company at about three and thixth ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would make ’em happy.’</p>
     <p>All these little tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very willingly undertook to render. 
      Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for such a service.</p>
     <p>‘Very well, Thquire; then, if you’ll only give a Horthe-riding, a bethpeak, whenever you
      can, you’ll more than balanthe the account.  Now, Thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me,
      I thould like one parting word with you.’</p>
     <p>Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring and drinking his
      brandy and water as he stood, went on:</p>
     <p>‘Thquire, — you don’t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.’</p>
     <p>‘Their instinct,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘is surprising.’</p>
     <p>‘Whatever you call it — and I’m bletht if <hi>I</hi> know what to call it’ — said Sleary,
      ‘it ith athtonithing.  The way in whith a dog’ll find you — the dithtanthe he’ll come!’</p>
     <p>‘His scent,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘being so fine.’</p>
     <p>‘I’m bletht if I know what to call it,’ repeated Sleary, shaking his head, ‘but I have had
      dogth find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think whether that dog hadn’t gone to another
      dog, and thed, “You don’t happen to know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do you?  Perthon of
      the name of Thleary, in the Horthe-Riding way — thtout man — game eye?”  And whether that dog
      mightn’t have thed, “Well, I can’t thay I know him mythelf, but I know a dog that I think
      would be likely to be acquainted with him.”  And whether that dog mightn’t have thought it
      over, and thed, “Thleary, Thleary!  O yeth, to be thure!  A friend of mine menthioned him to
      me at one time.  I can get you hith addreth directly.”  In conthequenth of my being afore the
      public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht be a number of dogth acquainted with
      me, Thquire, that <hi>I</hi> don’t know!’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation.</p>
     <p>‘Any way,’ said Sleary, after putting his lips to his brandy and water, ‘ith fourteen month
      ago, Thquire, thinthe we wath at Chethter.  We wath getting up our Children in the Wood one
      morning, when there cometh into our Ring, by the thtage door, a dog.  He had travelled a long
      way, he wath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind.  He went round to
      our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking for a child he know’d; and then he
      come to me, and throwd hithelf up behind, and thtood on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath,
      and then he wagged hith tail and died.  Thquire, that dog wath Merrylegth.’</p>
     <p>‘Sissy’s father’s dog!’</p>
     <p>‘Thethilia’th father’th old dog.  Now, Thquire, I can take my oath, from my knowledge of
      that dog, that that man wath dead — and buried — afore that dog come back to me.  Joth’phine
      and Childerth and me talked it over a long time, whether I thould write or not.  But we
      agreed, “No.  There’th nothing comfortable to tell; why unthettle her mind, and make her
      unhappy?”  Tho, whether her father bathely detherted her; or whether he broke hith own heart
      alone, rather than pull her down along with him; never will be known, now, Thquire, till — no,
      not till we know how the dogth findth uth out!’</p>
     <p>‘She keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this hour; and she will believe in his
      affection to the last moment of her life,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
     <p>‘It theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon, don’t it, Thquire?’ said Mr. Sleary,
      musing as he looked down into the depths of his brandy and water: ‘one, that there ith a love
      in the world, not all Thelf-interetht after all, but thomething very different; t’other, that
      it hath a way of ith own of calculating or not calculating, whith thomehow or another ith at
      leatht ath hard to give a name to, ath the wayth of the dogth ith!’</p>
     <p>Mr. Gradgrind looked out of window, and made no reply.  Mr. Sleary emptied his glass and
      recalled the ladies.</p>
     <p>‘Thethilia my dear, kith me and good-bye!  Mith Thquire, to thee you treating of her like a
      thithter, and a thithter that you trutht and honour with all your heart and more, ith a very
      pretty thight to me.  I hope your brother may live to be better detherving of you, and a
      greater comfort to you.  Thquire, thake handth, firtht and latht!  Don’t be croth with uth
      poor vagabondth.  People mutht be amuthed.  They can’t be alwayth a learning, nor yet they
      can’t be alwayth a working, they an’t made for it.  You <hi>mutht</hi> have uth, Thquire.  Do
      the withe thing and the kind thing too, and make the betht of uth; not the wurtht!’</p>
     <p>‘And I never thought before,’ said Mr. Sleary, putting his head in at the door again to say
      it, ‘that I wath tho muth of a Cackler!’</p>

     <head>CHAPTER IX FINAL</head>
     <p>It is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain blusterer, before
      the vain blusterer sees it himself.  Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously
      anticipated him, and presumed to be wiser than he.  Inappeasably indignant with her for her
      triumphant discovery of Mrs. Pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part of a woman in her
      dependent position, over and over in his mind, until it accumulated with turning like a great
      snowball.  At last he made the discovery that to discharge this highly connected female — to
      have it in his power to say, ‘She was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me, but I
      wouldn’t have it, and got rid of her’ — would be to get the utmost possible amount of crowning
      glory out of the connection, and at the same time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her
      deserts.</p>
     <p>Filled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Bounderby came in to lunch, and sat
      himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his portrait was.  Mrs. Sparsit sat by
      the fire, with her foot in her cotton stirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.</p>
     <p>Since the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her pity for Mr. Bounderby with a veil
      of quiet melancholy and contrition.  In virtue thereof, it had become her habit to assume a
      woful look, which woful look she now bestowed upon her patron.</p>
     <p>‘What’s the matter now, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bounderby, in a very short, rough way.</p>
     <p>‘Pray, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘do not bite my nose off.’</p>
     <p>‘Bite your nose off, ma’am?’ repeated Mr. Bounderby.  ‘<hi>Your</hi> nose!’ meaning, as Mrs.
      Sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for the purpose.  After which offensive
      implication, he cut himself a crust of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said, ‘Mr. Bounderby, sir!’</p>
     <p>‘Well, ma’am?’ retorted Mr. Bounderby.  ‘What are you staring at?’</p>
     <p>‘May I ask, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘have you been ruffled this morning?’</p>
     <p>‘Yes, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘May I inquire, sir,’ pursued the injured woman, ‘whether <hi>I</hi> am the unfortunate
      cause of your having lost your temper?’</p>
     <p>‘Now, I’ll tell you what, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘I am not come here to be bullied.  A
      female may be highly connected, but she can’t be permitted to bother and badger a man in my
      position, and I am not going to put up with it.’  (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on:
      foreseeing that if he allowed of details, he would be beaten.)</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her Coriolanian eyebrows; gathered up her work
      into its proper basket; and rose.</p>
     <p>‘Sir,’ said she, majestically.  ‘It is apparent to me that I am in your way at present.  I
      will retire to my own apartment.’</p>
     <p>‘Allow me to open the door, ma’am.’</p>
     <p>‘Thank you, sir; I can do it for myself.’</p>
     <p>‘You had better allow me, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, passing her, and getting his hand upon the
      lock; ‘because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to you, before you go.  Mrs.
      Sparsit, ma’am, I rather think you are cramped here, do you know?  It appears to me, that,
      under my humble roof, there’s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other
      people’s affairs.’</p>
     <p>Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great politeness, ‘Really,
      sir?’</p>
     <p>‘I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have happened, ma’am,’ said
      Bounderby; ‘and it appears to my poor judgment — ’</p>
     <p>‘Oh!  Pray, sir,’ Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness, ‘don’t disparage
      your judgment.  Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby’s judgment is.  Everybody has had
      proofs of it.  It must be the theme of general conversation.  Disparage anything in yourself
      but your judgment, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing.</p>
     <p>Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:</p>
     <p>‘It appears to me, ma’am, I say, that a different sort of establishment altogether would
      bring out a lady of <hi>your</hi> powers.  Such an establishment as your relation, Lady
      Scadgers’s, now.  Don’t you think you might find some affairs there, ma’am, to interfere
      with?’</p>
     <p>‘It never occurred to me before, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit; ‘but now you mention it,
      should think it highly probable.’</p>
     <p>‘Then suppose you try, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, laying an envelope with a cheque in it in her
      little basket.  ‘You can take your own time for going, ma’am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it
      will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind, to eat her meals by herself, and not
      to be intruded upon.  I really ought to apologise to you — being only Josiah Bounderby of
      Coketown — for having stood in your light so long.’</p>
     <p>‘Pray don’t name it, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘If that portrait could speak, sir — but
      it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and
      disgusting others, — it would testify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually
      addressed it as the picture of a Noodle.  Nothing that a Noodle does, can awaken surprise or
      indignation; the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt.’</p>
     <p>Thus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features like a medal struck to commemorate her
      scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to foot, swept disdainfully past him,
      and ascended the staircase.  Mr. Bounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire;
      projecting himself after his old explosive manner into his portrait — and into futurity.</p>
     <p>Into how much of futurity?  He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight at the points of
      all the weapons in the female armoury, with the grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady
      Scadgers, still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income
      down by about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a mere closet for
      one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more?  Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a
      show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his master’s great merits,
      who had won young Tom’s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by
      various rascals he was spirited away?  Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making
      a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each
      taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby
      Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go
      to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for
      ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster? 
      Had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to
      die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career
      of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?  Probably
      not.  Yet the portrait was to see it all out.</p>
     <p>Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting thoughtful in his own
      room.  How much of futurity did <hi>he</hi> see?  Did he see himself, a white-haired decrepit
      man, bending his hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and
      figures subservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind that Heavenly
      trio in his dusty little mills?  Did he catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his
      late political associates?  Did he see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the
      national dustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an abstraction called a
      People, ‘taunting the honourable gentleman’ with this and with that and with what not, five
      nights a-week, until the small hours of the morning?  Probably he had that much foreknowledge,
      knowing his men.</p>
     <p>Here was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in days of yore, though
      with a gentler and a humbler face.  How much of the future might arise before <hi>her</hi>
      vision?  Broadsides in the streets, signed with her father’s name, exonerating the late
      Stephen Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own son,
      with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not bring himself to add, his
      education) might beseech; were of the Present.  So, Stephen Blackpool’s tombstone, with her
      father’s record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be.  These
      things she could plainly see.  But, how much of the Future?</p>
     <p>A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again appearing at the
      ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown
      Hands; a woman of pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and
      even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have compassion on a
      degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging
      of her, and crying to her; a woman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring
      to do it as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more?  Did Louisa see
      this?  Such a thing was to be.</p>
     <p>A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted with tears, that
      her words had too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply
      bartered for a sight of her dear face?  At length this brother coming nearer home, with hope
      of seeing her, and being delayed by illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand, saying ‘he
      died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence and love of you: his last word
      being your name’?  Did Louisa see these things?  Such things were to be.</p>
     <p>Herself again a wife — a mother — lovingly watchful of her children, ever careful that they
      should have a childhood of the mind no less than a childhood of the body, as knowing it to be
      even a more beautiful thing, and a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and
      happiness to the wisest?  Did Louisa see this?  Such a thing was never to be.</p>
     <p>But, happy Sissy’s happy children loving her; all children loving her; she, grown learned in
      childish lore; thinking no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised; trying hard to know
      her humbler fellow-creatures, and to beautify their lives of machinery and reality with those
      imaginative graces and delights, without which the heart of infancy will wither up, the
      sturdiest physical manhood will be morally stark death, and the plainest national prosperity
      figures can show, will be the Writing on the Wall, — she holding this course as part of no
      fantastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or pledge, or covenant, or fancy dress,
      or fancy fair; but simply as a duty to be done, — did Louisa see these things of herself? 
      These things were to be.</p>
     <p>Dear reader!  It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things
      shall be or not.  Let them be!  We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the
      ashes of our fires turn gray and cold.</p>
