			<head> PREFACE. </head>
			<p>
				When the author of "Michael Armstrong" first determined on
				attempting to draw the attention of her countrymen to the fearful evils inherent in
				the Factory System, as carried out in our manufacturing towns, she intended to
				divide her work into two portions, which should present the same subject under two
				different phases. It was her intention in the first of these to drag into the light
				of day, and place before the eyes of Englishmen, the hideous mass of injustice and
				suffering to which thousands of infant labourers are subjected, who toil in our
				monster spinning-mills. In the second, she proposed that the hero of her tale,
				having lived through his toil-worn boyhood, should have been seen embarked in those
				perfectly constitutional struggles for the amelioration of the sufferings of his
				class, in which many of the more enlightened operatives have been for some years
				engaged.</p>
			<p>The first division of the subject has been some time in the reader's hands. The true
				but most painful picture has been drawn faithfully and conscientiously. Of course
				voices have been raised to deny loudly the truth of all the author's statements, and
				to assert the whole to be a mere tissue of invention and falsehood. The same charges
				have been made against her upon another occasion, and she has lived to see the truth
				of her statements, so impugned, universally admitted. She awaits with perfect
				confidence the time when similar justice shall be rendered to these pages.</p>
			<p> But with respect to that division of the subject which it was intended to bring
				forward in the latter part of her work, the author's views have undergone very
				considerable change. Knowing the immense amount of evil to be remedied, and the
				urgent necessity, for many reasons, that this remedy should not be delayed, it is
				grievous to see <pb n="iv"/> ] misguided and unfortunate men pursuing a course which
				must necessarily neutralize the efforts of their true friends. When those in whose
				behalf she hoped to move the sympathy of their country are found busy in scenes of
				outrage and lawless violence, and uniting themselves with individuals whose
				doctrines are subversive of every species of social order, the author feels that it
				would be alike acting in violation of her own principles, and doing injury to the
				cause she wishes to serve, were she to persist in an attempt to hold up as objects
				of public sympathy, men who have stained their righteous cause with deeds of
				violence and blood. The author is well aware that many, as well operatives as their
				superiors, who were engaged in a virtuous struggle against the lawless power which
				oppresses them, deplore the madness of these ill-advised men as much as herself. But
				the cause has been too much sullied, and the sufferers too closely associated in the
				public eye with those who have been guilty of all she most deprecates, to permit her
				continuing the work as she intended. </p>
			<p>Under these circumstances she has determined that the existence of her hero as an
				operative shall close with his childhood. No misconstruction of principles, no
				misconception of motives can exist with regard to an attempt to ameliorate the lot
				of infant labourers. That her pages may assist in promoting this object is her
				humble and most ardent hope. "The Life and Adventures of Michael Armstrong" are,
				therefore, concluded in the twelfth number.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER I. </head>
			<p>DESCRIPTION OF DOWLING LODGE AND ITS APPURTENANCES — OF ITS MASTER — OF ITS MISTRESS
				— AND ALL THE MASTERS AND MISSES DOWLING — A LARGE DINNER-PARTY — A HOT
				DRAWING-ROOM, AND THE WAY TO ESCAPE FROM IT.</p>
			<p>No traveller can ride or drive within sight of Dowling Lodge, without being tempted
				to inquire, "Whose house is that?"</p>
			<p>It forms, indeed, a very striking object on the right of the London road, as the hill
				rises gradually, and overlooks the town of Ashleigh, one of the busiest in
				Lancashire, to the left; for although the trees about the mansion are not yet of
				sufficient growth to make it picturesque, its lofty portico, well-proportioned
				wings, and commanding site, render it an ornament to the neighbourhood for miles
				round.</p>
			<p> Those who are admitted to a nearer view of the house (and, for the convenience of
				the public, every Wednesday is set apart for its being shown), will find still more
				to admire, than such as see it only from a distance. It has its park and its pinery;
				conservatories, which cause the mercury in the thermometer, when paraded through
				them, to run up to the cocoa-ripening heat of the tropics, and ice-houses that would
				bring it down again to the temperature of Bhering's Straits. It has three
				drawing-rooms, two dining-rooms, a great library, all full of new books; as many
				bedrooms, dressing-rooms, and boudoirs, as a great man's house ought to have, and a
				study besides — Sir Matthew Dowling's own private study. This delightful little
				apartment is small, not more than twelve feet square; but nothing can be more
				agreeable and convenient. It opens by one door from the great hall of entrance, and
				by another communicates <pb n="2"/> ] through a long stone-passage with the offices
				of the mansion; enabling the knight to receive, without interruption, not only his
				overlookers (Sir Matthew being the proprietor of many cotton-mills), but his
				coachman, gardener, bailiff, and whomever else he might wish to transact business
				with. </p>
			<p>Of the fitting up of this princely mansion, it is only necessary to say, that it is
				done in a spirit of emulative imitation, which renders it fully equal, in this
				respect, to the most finished private dwellings in Europe. The furniture is
				uniformly rich throughout: the picture-frames in the best style of art; Saxony
				carpets in the drawing-rooms, Turkey ditto in the dining-rooms, Brussels in the
				bedrooms, and indeed not a single inch of Kidderminster any where, except in the
				garrets.</p>
			<p>I will not attempt to state the amount of Sir Matthew Dowling's wealth; Cocker
				himself would have found it a laborious task to make the calculation; and it is
				sufficient for the gratification of all reasonable curiosity to say, that throughout
				the whole line of that Golconda country, which, being the busiest of the
				manufacturing districts, is probably the richest in the world, there was not any one
				who could vie in wealth with him. In a word, he shone amidst his rich neighbours
				like a golden sun, surrounded by silver moons.</p>
			<p>But Sir Matthew was a superior man in all ways. He was six feet two inches in height,
				and stout in proportion, with hands and feet that might have sufficed a giant. His
				intellectual gifts were also of no ordinary character. He liked well enough,
				perhaps, to stand pre-eminent in the commercial estimation of his neighbours; but so
				enlightened was his spirit, that he liked better still to shine before their eyes as
				a man of taste, a literary and accomplished gentleman, a speaker of modern
				languages. a critical French scholar, a playful votary of the muses himself, and a
				universal Mecænas to all who wielded a pen in their service. But beyond all else,
				Sir Matthew valued himself upon his reputation for the lighter graces of wit and
				gallantry: he sought to make himself into something of a delightful mixture between
				Killigrew and the Count de Gramont; and there was no receptacle of wit from Joe
				Miller downwards, no gallant memoirs in an intelligible tongue, that he did not
				study with assiduity and perseverance of the highest order.</p>
			<p>He was often heard to declare, that he loved nothing so well as the promotion of
				mirth and light-heartedness among his fellow-creatures; but tragedy and comedy often
				walk through the world hand in hand together, and their alliance may be traced
				without difficulty in the career of Sir Matthew Dowling.</p>
			<p>The wife of this prosperous gentleman had also many admirable qualities. She was not
				one of the idle gossipers who delight in chattering about their own concerns to
				every one who will listen; she despised such weakness, and had never been heard to
				hint at her own parentage, or early history, to any one; rightly considering, that
				when such matters are unceasingly discussed, they may be exceedingly likely to
				prevent people's minding their own business, while devoting an undue share of
				attention to that of others.</p>
			<pb n="3"/>
			<p>Nevertheless, with nice and laudable discrimination, she took care that her
				neighbours should be well acquainted with all such facts respecting her as it
				concerned them to know. There was hardly an individual within ten miles who was not
				aware that Lady Dowling kept two carriages, six horses, one coachman, one postilion,
				five gardeners, two grooms, three footmen, one butler, and a page — not to mention
				two nurses, four nursery-maids, and more ladies'-maids, housemaids, cookmaids,
				kitchen-maids, laundry-maids, stillroom maids, dairy-maids, and the like, than any
				other lady in the county. Neither could any be ignorant that, except in the article
				of jewels, her wardrobe might vie with that of any duchess in the land, and all
				might see, moreover, that she was comely still, both in form and feature. She
				conversed with great ability on all subjects connected with fashionable life; and
				though some few carping critics thought that she was too apt to diversify the
				monotony of the English language, by indulging in some remarkable variations from
				its ordinary laws, nobody, or scarcely any body, attempted to deny that she was on
				the whole a very charming woman. Such was the testimony of her general acquaintance;
				those who knew her better were aware that her moral qualities outshone, as they
				always ought to do, all her external graces. She was a faithful and exceedingly fond
				wife, and doted upon all her children; no woman could more heartily detest every
				species of light flirting airs in females, and, being deeply sensible of the
				dangerous attractions of youth and beauty in her own sex, she studiously avoided
				bringing those of her family who might suffer thereby from coming in contact with
				any thing of the kind; so that the female portion of her establishment consisted of
				the ugliest set of neat and carefully dressed middle-aged women that ever were found
				assembled together.</p>
			<p>The knight and his excellent lady were blessed with a very numerous progeny,
				certainly not less than eighteen or twenty; but, as they were rarely all at home
				together, it was at no time easy to count them.</p>
			<p>Augustus, the eldest of the family, was a prodigiously fine young man, just returned
				from college. He had not indeed thought it necessary to take a degree, nor did Sir
				Matthew or her ladyship particularly wish it; both of them being of opinion that
				little distinction could be gained by the assumption of a title which was never used
				in society, and to which he conceived every Englishman to be eligible who could just
				read and write a little. But as, on all points that concerned the interest of his
				eldest son, Sir Matthew was too deeply interested to run any risk of blundering: he
				did not give his consent for the return of Augustus, without his having gone through
				this idle academic ceremony, till he had paid a visit to the rector of his parish,
				to elicit from him some information on the subject.</p>
			<p>"May I ask, sir," said Sir Matthew abruptly, "what degree you took at the
				university?"</p>
			<p> Mr. Hetherington was a new incumbent, and might, perhaps, have been a little
				affronted at a question which, by the blunt manner of it, seemed almost to insinuate
				a doubt whether he had taken any <pb n="4"/> degree at all; but, though a good man,
				and an excellent clergyman to boot, he had a strong taste for humour, and had
				already discovered that his neighbour at the great house was rich in more ways than
				one. It was, therefore, with the utmost civility that he answered, "My degree, Sir
				Matthew, was that of Master of Arts." </p>
			<p>"And pray, sir, does it give you any title by which you can be distinguished as in
				any way a superior sort of person in society?"</p>
			<p>"I am afraid not, Sir Matthew," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"I thank you, sir, for your sincerity," rejoined the knight. "It was important that I
				should ascertain the truth on this point. — You are, then, never addressed in
				company as Mr. Master of Arts, or any thing of that kind?"</p>
			<p>"I have never yet, Sir Matthew, met with any one of sufficient politeness to do me
				that honour," replied Mr. Hetherington gravely.</p>
			<p>"And I suppose you have lived in respectable society?"</p>
			<p>"Very decent society — very decent, Sir Matthew," replied Hetherington, whose mother
				was the daughter of a distinguished nobleman.</p>
			<p>"Good morning, sir; I shall be happy to see you at Dowling Lodge — that is to say,
				sir, if your gown does not lead you to object to elegant amusements. I love science,
				Mr. Hetherington, and am indeed devoted to every thing intellectual; but,
				notwithstanding this, I am a worshipper at the shrine of grace and wit, and could
				not exist among people who did not relish the lighter embellishments of
				society."</p>
			<p>"I shall be happy, Sir Matthew, to share in your gayer hours, provided I am fortunate
				enough to find that you have no objection to profit by my graver ones," replied the
				clergyman.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew returned from this visit very well pleased with the new rector. Mr.
				Augustus was immediately comforted by a letter, informing him that he might call in
				his accounts, and prepare to leave the university as soon as he pleased; and, within
				ten days after receiving it, the amiable young man was restored to the bosom of his
				family.</p>
			<p> Next to this primal hope of the Dowling race, came three young ladies, between the
				ages of seventeen and twenty-one; the two eldest of them being as like as two peas,
				and the third like nothing on earth but herself. Then followed several young
				gentlemen, who were placed at different fashionable schools; for Sir Matthew, who
				was a man of very enlarged mind, declared it to be his opinion and his principle,
				that the patronage of such a fortune as his should be extended as widely as
				possible. After these young gentlemen came, one after the other, with the interval
				of about eleven months between them, ever so many little girls, who, for the
				present, were all educated at home, having a particularly clever French governess.
				All the rest were nice little children of different degrees of babyhood; the dear
				little girls being remarkable for their long plaited hair, short frocks, and
				furbelowed trousers, and the dear little boys for the manly bustle with which they
				wore their Scotch bonnets and plaided tunics, which, considering that neither Sir
				Matthew nor his <pb n="5"/> lady had ever been in Scotland in their lives, showed
				great enlargement of national feeling. Altogether, it was considered to be the
				finest family ever seen. </p>
			<p>It happened upon a broiling day about the middle of July, during one of the hottest
				summers England had ever known, that Sir Matthew and Lady Dowling "entertained a
				party of distinguished fashionables" at dinner.</p>
			<p>It may have been remarked by those who study such subjects, that there is a
				difference between a dinner-party given at such a grand mansion as that of Sir
				Matthew Dowling, and one at a dwelling of perhaps not a quarter the size, where the
				owners are of a different order of the aristocracy, having a longer pedigree, and a
				shorter purse. At both, probably, the banquet will be a costly one, yet the one
				entertainment will <hi>come off</hi> in a manner as unlike as possible to the other.
				There is something in the usual way of wearing stiff new-made grandeur, not far
				unlike that of wearing stiff new-made clothes. Neither the one nor the other sit
				easily.</p>
			<p>At this splendid dinner at Dowling Lodge, the company consisted of a selection from
				the neighbouring families, made on the most legitimate principles of exclusiveness;
				no family being invited who did not drive four horses at the races. To this there
				were indeed two exceptions. The first was the Right Honourable Lady Clarissa
				Shrimpton; but this distinguished lady, though she drove only one pony instead of
				four horses, was considered by all the country round as the one thing needful to
				render a party completely elegant. She was, indeed, neither young, handsome, nor
				rich, but she was Lady Clarissa, and this was enough.</p>
			<p>The other exception was to be found in the rotund person of Dr. Crockley, who having
				formerly been a celebrated quack, made a little fortune, and taken out a diploma,
				had lately married a beauty, and settled in the town of Ashleigh, where he was well
				pleased to pick up a few guinea fees, both as a public evidence of his being a real
				M.D., and as a private fund wherewith to indulge his still very tender passion, by
				buying finery for his pretty young wife.</p>
			<p>This fat little gentleman was an especial favourite with Sir Matthew, chiefly on
				account of his jocund humour and ready laugh; and also, perhaps, because he had a
				pleasant way, peculiar to himself, of paying compliments in the bluntest and most
				unstudied manner possible.</p>
			<p> But, notwithstanding the presence of all these distinguished persons, the dinner
				moved on very slowly. Sir Matthew, indeed, was as brilliant as it was possible for
				any man to be under the circumstances, and Lady Clarissa, who did not scruple to
				declare that she was very partial to him, listened to all he said to her with as
				much attention at least as any lady could be expected to do, who was making one of
				sixteen at a dinner, where there were an equal number of dishes of hot meats reeking
				upon the table, and the thermometer standing at 87°. Dr. Crockley, too, laughed
				repeatedly; but his laugh was like a Lucifer match that fails, just kindling and <pb n="6"/> sputtering a little, but going out before it is able to communicate its
				light. </p>
			<p>The very sight of the servants as they panted round the table, was quite enough to
				smother and stifle all inclination for enjoyment — their shoes creaked — their faces
				shone — ice became water — the salad looked as if it were stewed — the cucumbers
				seemed to have fainted away — the prodigious turbot smelt fishy, and its attendant
				lobster-sauce glowed not with a deeper tint, than did my Lady Dowling's cheeks as
				her nose caught the unfragrant gale. In short, it was a great dinner in the
				dog-days, and no more need be said of it.</p>
			<p>Great was the inward satisfaction of every guest, when at last Lady Dowling rose, and
				gave signal that the party was to be divided in half. The languid ladies welcomed
				the coolness of the marble hall as they passed through it, and the gentlemen gazed
				eagerly at the butler as he brought forward a fresh supply of claret, and a
				reinforcement of ice. But the enjoyment of neither party lasted long; for Lady
				Dowling was too grand and too solemn not to marshal all her company into her fine
				drawing-room, where they were all ceremoniously deposited on satin sofas, amidst
				swelling pillows that might have defied the frosts of January; while seven or eight
				hot-looking children were commanded to walk round the circle and kiss every
				body.</p>
			<p>Nor did the gentlemen fare much better; for scarcely had the drawing-room door closed
				after the ladies, before the shining baldhead of Dr. Crockley stretched itself up
				nearly to a level with the long-backed Sir Matthew's breast-pin, whilst, with a very
				ominous sort of growl, making itself heard before his lips opened, he first
				preluded, and then uttered the following speech.</p>
			<p>"I don't like it, Sir Matthew. — I don't like this business at the Weavers'
				Arms."</p>
			<p>"What business, Doctor?" replied his friend sharply.</p>
			<p>"Why this meeting, Sir Matthew. I can't get the notion of a strike out of my head."
				Every chair was drawn towards the little doctor: nobody had heard a word of it.
				"Well, gentleman, perhaps I am mistaken — perhaps there has been no meeting,"
				resumed the friendly doctor. "God knows, I don't wish to spoil the enjoyment of this
				delightful hour; but at any rate, my good friends, it is as well for you to be on
				the look-out." Then lowering his voice, he muttered, as near to the ear of Sir
				Matthew as he could reach, "I know that your people are meeting, in doors and out of
				doors. But you are such a good, generous, kind-hearted creature, that I dare say we
				shall hear, before long, of your having done some d — d goodnatured thing or other,
				and that perhaps will set all right; who knows?"</p>
			<p> Sir Matthew gave an almost imperceptible nod, and pushed on the claret-jug; but the
				gaiety of the party had been effectually checked, and it was not long before the
				second richest man in company (Sir Matthew of course being the first) said, "I do
				think and <pb n="7"/> believe, Sir Matthew, that my lady's coffee would do more to
				cool us than your wine." The opinion was not opposed, and, much earlier than usual,
				the gentlemen rose, and followed the ladies. </p>
			<p>But this movement did not appear greatly to increase the enjoyment of either party.
				It was near nine o'clock, but the heat continued to be most oppressive, and the
				company being for the most part massive in all ways, their union produced more
				additional caloric than gaiety. The whole process seemed to have the power of
				turning the hours into molten lead as they passed, a portion of which appeared to
				drop, and weigh heavily on each individual head. In vain Sir Matthew made the
				circuit of the company, pausing in front either of the richest or handsomest ladies,
				as duty or inclination preponderated; in vain he uttered his newest puns and
				freshest bon-mots — not one of them had strength to laugh, beyond a little feeble
				"he, he!" and even that was evidently a painful effort.</p>
			<p>Things were in this state, when Lady Clarissa Shrimpton suddenly rose from the silken
				couch amidst whose pillows she was imbedded, and, without explaining her intentions
				to my Lady Dowling, or any one else, darted through the open French-window, and out
				upon the well-shaven lawn.</p>
			<p> Had it been possible that any one in the room could have been ignorant of the rank
				of Lady Clarissa, he must from that moment have felt an innate conviction that she
				was somebody; for nobody that was not somebody could have ventured upon so daring an
				escapade from such a solemn presence-chamber. The effect it produced was electric.
				Sir Matthew darted across the room with the eagerness of a man of gallantry and
				gaiety. He piqued himself upon being, of all the great men in the neighbourhood, the
				one upon whom Lady Clarissa bestowed the most attention. His estimate of the outward
				advantages of his extensive person was indeed not a low one; and, despite all his
				lady could do to crush such an odious idea, he was conscious that he was devoted to
				the fair sex, and flattered himself that the fair sex was not ungrateful. In fact,
				his general manner to ladies had a good deal of what in female slang is called
					<hi>swaining</hi> ; but to Lady Clarissa it was certainly something more. Had
				she been simply Miss Shrimpton, it is probable that, notwithstanding her great
				mental advantages, she would never have been exposed to the danger of this
				fascinating distinction, for she was nearly forty years old, had a sharp nose, and
				was deplorably thin. But Sir Matthew was not a man to be insensible to the charm of
				getting talked of in the neighbourhood about his devotion to Lady Clarissa any body,
				even had she been a skeleton with a Gorgon's head. There was, however, independently
				of her bewitching title, a charm in her conversation and character, to which the
				knight was peculiarly sensible. Her ladyship was celebrated for her devotion both to
				literature and art; and she permitted all the world to know, for indeed she never
				ceased to repeat it, that talent of every kind was to her an object of idolatry. Now
				Sir Matthew knew that he was full of talent — poetical <pb n="8"/> talent, pictorial
				talent, epigrammatic talent, every kind of talent, and it was certainly very
				delightful to be appreciated by such a superior creature as Lady Clarissa. So
				strongly indeed did this intellectual sympathy between them occasionally manifest
				itself, that not even the sharp elbows and red-tipped nose of the noble lady, who,
				to borrow the phrase of an inimitable describer, was in every sense "
					<hi>preter-blue perfect</hi> ," could render Lady Dowling quite easy respecting
				the nature of the friendship. Nor was it without something like a pang that she
				marked the sudden alacrity of movement with which Sir Matthew now strode across the
				floor to accompany Lady Clarissa in the extraordinary frolic which led her, in white
				satin shoes and a gauze dress, to exchange the drawing-room for the garden, at nine
				o'clock in the evening. </p>
			<p>But upon this occasion, as upon many others, Lady Dowling found consolation in the
				well-known fact, that Lady Clarissa rarely moved a step without being obsequiously
				attended by her humble companion, Miss Mogg. This young lady had been selected to
				fill her present enviable situation, principally from her appearance, though she was
				indeed by no means void of many other qualifications admirably suited to it. But in
				appearance she was a striking contrast to her tall and slender patroness; and,
				notwithstanding Lady Clarissa's mental superiority, she was not insensible to the
				advantage of having a foil that should set off the charms upon which she
				particularly prided herself. Lady Clarissa had a thin, narrow foot, and an ancle
				that resembled nothing so much as the leg of a Robin red-breast; the person of Miss
				Mogg was supported on shafts that told her Saxon origin, and feet that need not have
				shrunk from sustaining an ox. Lady Clarissa's slender waist might have been
				encircled by a ring of six inches diameter; a cestus of nearly double the span had
				often gone nigh to suffocate her plump companion. The throat of Lady Clarissa had
				not only all the flexile length of the swan's, but might even be said to resemble
				that of the stork in its proportions; while the head of Miss Mogg was separated from
				her shoulders by an interval so trifling, as hardly to be perceptible at all. The
				hair of her ladyship, though not very abundant, was as black as ink, and its
				straight nature enabled her to lay it in classic bands upon her forehead, furnishing
				a graceful foundation for the wreath of oak leaves with which, in judicious
				imitation of Domenichino's exquisite head of Sappho, she usually adorned herself
				when in full dress: while Miss Mogg, on the contrary, had a bushy abundance of
				flaxen curls, which gave a round fussy sort of contour to her face, that could not
				fail of setting off to advantage the severer outline of the noble lady; and, in a
				word, the contrast was altogether perfect.</p>
			<p> To the great satisfaction of Lady Dowling, this round little personage arose, as
				usual, when her principal rose, and waddled to the window after her. Many people are
				apt to overlook and forget companions, and the poor toady is as much used to be trod
				upon as the despised reptile whose name she bears. But if the world in <pb n="9"/>
				general be found guilty of this scorn towards what is too lowly to turn, and scorn
				again, more especially was our knight liable to the weakness. </p>
			<p>As he now hastened to offer his hand to Lady Clarissa in order to assist her in
				stepping over the window-sill, he very nearly overturned Miss Mogg as he passed her;
				but heeding neither the resistance her plump person offered to his passing elbow,
				nor yet the timid "oh!" which spoke her alarm, he hurried onward, and, manfully
				seizing the hand whose touch was honor, walked out side by side with the titled lady
				upon the lawn.</p>
		</div><div type="chapter">
			<head> CHAPTER II. </head>
			<p>A DELIGHTFUL RAMBLE — FRIENDSHIP AND THE MUSE — AN ADVENTURE — DANGER AND ESCAPE —
				GRATITUDE AND BENEVOLENCE.</p>
			<p>" Only see that! How very extraordinary!" exclaimed Lady Dowling,
				suddenly rising, and addressing herself to no one in particular.</p>
			<p>"Oh! how delightful!" cried several ladies at once. "How clever Lady Clarissa is!
				Such a delicious refreshment!" "To be sure, it is the only thing in the world to do
				on such an evening as this," exclaimed Miss Brotherton; who, as being the richest
				young lady in company, very properly thought she ought to speak first. "I am sure I
				shall follow her example;" and so saying, she rose and walked towards the window.
				Three of the most dauntless ladies in the party started up to follow her; which,
				strange as the manoeuvre appeared to the full-dressed Lady Dowling, she did not
				oppose, greatly preferring that the garden party should be enlarged. But, though not
				by her, the adventurous fair ones were stopped before they accomplished their
				design, by a chorus of remonstrances from all the rest of the company, male and
				female.</p>
			<p>"My dear Miss Brotherton, you will catch your death!" cried one.</p>
			<p>"Oh! look at your satin shoes!" screamed another. "What would Mr. Tomkins say if he
				was here, Mrs. Tomkins?" demanded a third.</p>
			<p>"And your neck and shoulders, Miss Williamson!" whispered a fourth.</p>
			<p> "And your blonde dress, Mrs. Simpkins!" vociferated a fifth; with a vast deal more
				in the same strain. So that before the <hi>sortie</hi> was accomplished, every lady,
				save Miss Brotherton, yielded before the storm of reasons that pelted them on all
				sides. The rich young <pb n="10"/> lady, however, stood firm: what young lady with
				two hundred thousand pounds would not? </p>
			<p>"Mr. Augustus Dowling," said she, still pursuing her way window-ward, but pausing ere
				she stepped out, "will you have the excessive kindness, — <hi>vraiment j'ai
					honte;</hi> ; but will you have the charity to look in the hall for my pink
				satin <hi>mantelet</hi> , trimmed with swansdown; without it I fear my poor little
				shoulders will be <hi>arrosées</hi> — 'too rudely, alas!' with the dews of
				night."</p>
			<p>Now the young lady's shoulders were really very pretty little shoulders, and,
				moreover, Mr. Augustus Dowling, notwithstanding all his elegant <hi>nonchalance</hi>
				, perfectly well remembered that she had two hundred thousand pounds; so, before she
				had stamped with her little foot twice, in her impatience to join those who, from
				their gaiety, seemed to be so greatly enjoying the fresh air, he returned with the
					<hi>mantelet</hi> , and having, as usual, adjusted his glass in the corner of
				his eye to prevent his making any mistakes, placed it on her shoulders.</p>
			<p>"Now, then!" she cried, "give me your arm. Is not this good fun?"</p>
			<p>The young gentleman obeyed, declaring it was delightful, and in a moment they were
				beside Lady Clarissa and Sir Matthew; good Miss Mogg keeping a step or two
				behind.</p>
			<p>"Nobody but your ladyship had wit enough to find out that there was more air to be
				got out of doors than in," said the heiress, venturing to pass her arm through that
				of her noble friend. But, upon this occasion, Lady Clarissa, though particularly
				intimate with Miss Brotherton, and seldom refusing to use her carriage and act as
				her chaperone to all the parties in the neighbourhood, seemed inclined to check her
				advances.</p>
			<p>"My dear child," said she, "I am delighted to see you come out. I am sure you must
				have been half stifled, as well as myself. But you and Mr. Augustus must wander away
				by yourselves, and you may take Mogg with you, if you like it, for I have just got
				into a discussion with Sir Matthew, that I would not break off for the world. So
				away with you, my dear, as fast as you can."</p>
			<p>Lady Clarissa's will was of course law, even to the heiress, but it was not without a
				little toss of the head that she turned off to another walk; nor was it without a
				considerable struggle between her inclination and a sense of propriety, which, all
				things considered, really did her honour, that she permitted poor Miss Mogg to obey
				the hint of her patroness, and follow after.</p>
			<p>"And so you really have not seen this gifted young man yet, Sir Matthew?" resumed her
				ladyship, as soon as they were again alone. "You have never yet seen this Osmund
				Norval?"</p>
			<p>"No, my lady, I have not," replied the knight; "and to say the truth," he added,
				venturing to press with his stout arm the slender one that rested on it, "to say the
				truth, though I have heard a monstrous deal about him, I was determined that I would
				have nothing to say to him, till I had heard your opinion, my lady."</p>
			<pb n="11"/>
			<p>"How kind! how flattering, Sir Matthew! But you will let me bring him to you
				now?"</p>
			<p>"Will I?" (again pressing the lean arm.) "Fancy me saying no, when you tell me to say
				yes! Ah! my lady, you know better than that, or I am greatly mistaken."</p>
			<p>"Oh! Sir Matthew, you are always so kind! What magnificent gardens you have! By the
				way, I think I never tasted such a pine as that we had to-day. I assure you, my
				brother, Lord Highlandloch, is celebrated for his pines — quite celebrated. They are
				the finest in all Scotland, but I give you my honour, I never saw one equal to it at
				his table."</p>
			<p>"Oh! my lady, that is only your amiable condescension," replied Sir Matthew, greatly
				touched by this preference. "But if you really can be so polite as to think them
				good, I must entreat you just to let me knock at the head-gardener's door, who lives
				close outside this gate. I don't let him live inside, because of his children, Lady
				Clarissa. I know what birds peck the worst — ha! ha! ha! However, you <hi>must</hi>
				just let me pass through the gate to tell him to put up a brace for your ladyship.
				They shall be well taken care of now, my lady, trust me for that; I never valued
				them so much before, I promise you."</p>
			<p>"You are too kind a thousand times!" said the lady, stretching out her own hand to
				open the gate. "I will go with you; there is nothing I doat upon like visiting a
				gardener. Could he not take us into the hot-houses, Sir Matthew? You have no idea
				how I should enjoy it."</p>
			<p>By no means displeased to show off the high-born lady upon his arm, even to the eyes
				of his gardener, the knight joyfully assented to the proposal.</p>
			<p>"Macnab!" he cried, knocking as he passed the cottage-window, "Macnab! come here
				directly, and bring a knife and a basket with you; you must come directly — this
				very moment, and unlock the hot-houses — her ladyship wishes to walk through them,
				and I must have one or two of the finest pines cut, and packed in a basket, to be
				put into Miss Brotherton's carriage: but mind, they are for Lady Clarissa Shrimpton;
				so you had better give them in charge to her ladyship's own man."</p>
			<p>Mr. Alexander Macnab promptly left the seeds he was sorting, and prepared himself,
				basket in hand, to follow his master. The knight and the lady left the cottage,
				arm-and-arm together; but before they again entered the garden, a fancy seized her
				lively ladyship, that a short ramble in the green lane outside it would be the most
				agreeable thing in the world.</p>
			<p>"Dear me! what a poetical idea!" exclaimed Sir Matthew with enthusiasm. "there's only
				one thing," he said, stopping short, "but that will spoil my pleasure altogether: I
				am so dreadfully afraid that your ladyship will take cold."</p>
			<p>"Ask the gardener's wife to lend me one of her kerchiefs," said Lady Clarissa,
				laughing. "But it will only be to satisfy you, Sir Matthew, for there is no catching
				cold in such weather as this."</p>
			<pb n="12"/>
			<p>It was with something quite like tender anxiety that the knight stepped back, asked
				for and obtained a neat shawl, and himself wrapped it round the slender person of
				his amiable companion.</p>
			<p>"Thank you! thank you a thousand times! But, dear Sir Matthew, I must not lose my
				pines by my frolic: will you give the gardener orders to get them without waiting
				for us? and perhaps you would let him put up a bunch of grapes, and a few peaches at
				the same time — it is no good to let him wait for us, Sir Matthew; — when you and I
				get into a chat together, we shall neither of us think of the pines again."</p>
			<p>Quitting her highly-valued aristocratic arm for an instant, the flattered knight ran
				back and gave the necessary orders; and then, almost unconscious, in his full
				contentment, that his own gray head was as bare as that of the oak-crowned nymph by
				his side, he returned to his bewitching companion and led her gently onward over the
				mossy turf that bordered the road.</p>
			<p>The gardener and his wife stood together for a moment looking after them. "Who would
				think now that she was one of the true old gentlefolks, and Scotch to boot, to see
				her pair off that way with our rogue of a spinner there? How, in God's name, can she
				choose to be so free and friendly with such as he?" said the gardener.</p>
			<p>"Just for the same reason as yourself, Sawny," replied his wife; "to get all she can
				out of him."</p>
			<p>"And that's true," replied Sawny, setting off upon his business. "I had like to
				forget the pines, and the grapes, and the peaches. She's not so far wrong after all;
				and yet 'tis a pity, too."</p>
			<milestone unit="structure" rend="stars"/> 
			<p>The evening was still oppressively sultry, and hardly a breath of air disturbed
				either the leaves on the oaks beside the road, or those that mimicked them so
				abominably on the lady's brow; but, nevertheless, there was a freshness in the smell
				of the hedges and the grass, which could not fail to be agreeable to any nerves that
				had endured the steaming dinner, and the irksome drawing-room of Dowling Lodge.</p>
			<p>The shady lane in which the knight and the lady were thus recreating themselves,
				after skirting the extensive and lofty walls of the garden, turned at right angles
				both to the right and the left at the corner of it. The branch to the left followed
				the boundary of the garden, and led to the stable-yard and back entrance to the
				house; that to the right conducted to the factory, which was the source and
				head-spring of all the wealth that flowed over, and irrigated with its fructifying
				stream, meadows, parks, hot-beds and flower-gardens, till it made itself a
				prodigious cistern in the depths and heights of Dowling Lodge.</p>
			<p>When the strangely-matched pair came to this point, Sir Matthew made a halt, till
				Lady Clarissa came to the end of a little poem, which the protegé whom she was so
				desirous of introducing to her rich and (to use her own words) "really very clever
				friend," had inscribed in her album.</p>
			<p> Nothing could be more agreeable to her ladyship than this pause. <pb n="13"/> In the
				first place it was the greatest possible relief to her lungs, for the lines she was
				reciting were much too full of deep feeling to be repeated without a painful effort,
				while walking; and in the second, the halt, accompanied as it was by a look of
				earnest attention from her apparently-delighted companion, furnished the most
				agreeable commentary in the world upon the poem itself, as well as on her manner of
				reciting it. </p>
			<p>It said so plainly, "Stay! — move not! — lest a word, an intonation, a cadence, be
				lost to me!"</p>
			<p>Lady Clarissa was really touched by it; and let Sawny the gardener, and his wife
				Janet, say or think what they would, neither peaches nor pines had any thing to do
				with the gratification she at this moment experienced in the society of the great
				manufacturer.</p>
			<p>His eyes were fixed on her face, and she bore the gaze, and returned it with that
				sort of courage and confidence, which genuine enthusiasm alone can give.</p>
			<p>She had just finished a stanza when Sir Matthew ceased to move, and feeling that he
				did so under the influence of a spell, which she well knew would be more powerful
				still were it spoken when she were at rest — for Lady Clarissa was aware that she
				was exceedingly short-breathed — she repeated the last eight lines in a manner that
				showed she felt the pleasure she was producing — a pleasure, as she thought, like
				that occasionally caused by the repetition of some delicious phrase in a musical
				composition, reiterated as if to fill the soul with its sweetness.</p> <quote><l>"And should
			the eye for which I write </l><l>By sun-lit morn, or moon-lit night, </l><l>Drop on this record of my
			soul, </l><l>Which tells a part — ah! not the whole, </l><l>Of hopes that trembling, faltering, timid,
			</l><l>Now fire my cheek, now turn it livid, — </l><l>Should that soft eye but drop one tear, </l><l>I'd hug
			my chain, and call it dear!"</l></quote> <p>The tear asked for, almost came as she ceased.</p>
			<p>"You feel it, dear Sir Matthew!" she said, in a voice of considerable emotion.</p>
			<p>"I'd hug my chain, and call it dear!" — she again murmured, hanging on his arm with
				such an evident degree of weakness, as showed the slender form to be less powerful
				than the ardent spirit it enshrined.</p>
			<p>"Let us turn back," said Sir Matthew. "My dear friend," faintly ejaculated Lady
				Clarissa, "you are moved too strongly. — But — no, no! Sir Matthew! Believe me, it
				were far better for both of us that we should proceed. — Are we, either of us, my
				dear friend, in a state at this moment to meet the curious stare of idle eyes? —
				Come on, dear Sir Matthew!" — and she gently pulled him forward as she spoke — "this
				soft glade invites us."</p>
			<p> Though perfectly determined to find some excuse for not leading his fascinating
				companion within sight of his grim-looking factory, which another turn in the lane
				at no great distance would have made very unpicturesquely visible, it was impossible
				at that moment <pb n="14"/> not to yield to the gentle violence which carried him
				forward; and, in what Lady Clarissa felt to be very eloquent silence, he proceeded
				for a few steps farther. Considerably, however, before they had reached the dreaded
				turning, his good star shot a ray upon him in the shape of a very large cow, with a
				pair of enormous horns, that slowly turned the corner, and fronted them. </p>
			<p>"Good heaven!" he exclaimed in an accent of great alarm. — "There is that horrid
				spotted cow! she is the worst beast in the whole parish. Turn back, dearest Lady
				Clarissa! turn back instantly."</p>
			<p>"How kindly considerate!" returned Lady Clarissa. "But you little know the strength
				of your friend's mind, Sir Matthew. Were I alone, indeed, I might tremble and turn
				as pale as the veriest child that ever hid its face on a nurse's lap; but with you!"
				— and here the lady turned a very flattering glance on the athletic form of her
				protector — </p>
			<p>"Heaven knows," replied Sir Matthew, once more pressing her lean arm, "Heaven knows
				that all which the strength of man could do to protect you, would not be left undone
				by me — but consider the dog!" he added, pointing to a little cur that always
				followed him; "its power of irritating an animal of this kind is quite
				extraordinary." And as he spoke, he whistled in a note which meant, as his dog Spite
				knew as well as he did, neither more nor less than — "At her, Spite!"</p>
			<p>"If any thing can keep Spite quiet," resumed the knight, "it is whistling to
				him."</p>
			<p>Obedient to the true meaning of the signal, however, the dog sprang forward, and of
				course there ensued the scene which always follows on such occasions. The dog
				yelped, and affected to spring at the nose of the cow, while she, somewhat
				accelerating her stately pace, threw up her tail, and bent down her head till her
				horns nearly touched the ground, offering so exact an image of "the cow with the
				crumpled horn," with whose portrait her ladyship's early studies had made her
				familiar, that her confidence in the prowess of Sir Matthew could sustain her no
				longer, and she rapidly uttered a succession of tremendous screams.</p>
			<p>The purpose of the knight was accomplished, and he therefore indulged the fair lady
				by letting her scream on for at least a minute and a half, while he supported her
				with every appearance of the most pitying tenderness. Meanwhile, two little boys,
				who were making their way from the factory homewards, across a field by the side of
				the lane, ran with terrified curiosity, and all the strength they had, to a gate,
				through which they could see the interesting spectacle of a fine full-dressed lady,
				screaming with all her might from between the sheltering arms of the magnificent Sir
				Matthew Dowling, and a little dog worrying an old half-starved cow.</p>
			<p>"Come here, you young scamps!" cried the knight, on perceiving the two little heads
				peeping over the gate: "Don't you see what's going on? Clamber over the gate, can't
				you, and drive back that devil of a beast."</p>
			<pb n="15"/>
			<p>The youngest, but by far the stoutest and tallest of the two boys, instantly obeyed
				this command, and placing himself midway between the tormented cow and the fair
				creature, whose nerves her menacing attitude had so cruelly shaken, he stood
				manfully astride in the middle of the lane, flourished his ragged hat on high, and
				with a few lusty "wough! woughs!" repeated at the top of his young voice, succeeded
				in turning the front of the enemy, which was presently seen to wheel round, and, by
				a sort of feeble, ambling little trot, speedily got out of sight round the
				corner.</p>
			<p>"Now, then," said Sir Matthew, "let me lead you home, my dear lady!"</p>
			<p>"Not till I have thanked my little deliverer," exclaimed Lady Clarissa, with very
				sentimental fervour. "Good heaven! what might have been my fate without him! I know
				— I feel, Sir Matthew, that you never could have borne to leave me, and what then
				could have stopped the fearful approach of that most vicious animal? — Death, or
				worse than death — dislocation of limb, disfigurement of feature! Oh, Sir Matthew,
				your heart, I know, will go side by side with mine. Tell me, what can I do — what
				can we both do, to reward the astonishing bravery of that noble little fellow?"</p>
			<p>"Depend upon it, my lady, he will be delighted if you will give him sixpence."</p>
			<p>"Sixpence!" cried her ladyship, turning extremely red, — but in a moment she
				recovered herself and said: "Oh! Sir Matthew! do I not know how dearly you love a
				jest? Men of wit and humour can rarely be grave for long together, even under
				circumstances that most keenly touch their feelings; did I not know you well, my
				friend, what should I not think of your proposal? But come, come — be serious for a
				moment longer: we have, it is true, escaped a tremendous danger, and it may well
				make us feel light at heart; but we will not laugh over it, till we have settled in
				what way that heroic child shall receive the meed he has earned. I shall not rest in
				peace, my friend, unless his destiny be as favourably influenced by me, as mine has
				probably been by him. Sir Matthew, you have great power, enormous wealth, a generous
				heart, a noble nature, and intellect, before which, if I mistake not, all
				difficulties will melt away like a mist before the sun. Of all this I am quite
				certain. There is but one IF in the business. IF you value me, Sir Matthew, as much
				as I think you do, that little boy now getting over the gate will be clothed,
				educated, fed, lodged by you. Do I deceive myself? or will the daily sight of him,
				by renewing the memory of this evening, rather cause you pleasure than pain?"</p>
			<p> Sir Matthew Dowling clearly saw, that sending "the little blackguard to the devil,"
				which was decidedly what his heart whispered to him, would, at this stage of the
				business, be inevitably sending her sentimental ladyship to at least an equal
				distance from himself; and this he had no inclination to do. She was the only Lady
				Somebody Something in the whole neighbourhood, and he was quite aware that he had
				already acquired more envy and hatred among his friends and neighbours, by the
				superior degree of intimacy he had <pb n="16"/> contrived to achieve with her, than
				by all his successful struggles to outspend them all. </p>
			<p>This pleasure was not to be given up for a trifle, especially at a moment when it
				seemed so very clear that it only depended on himself to make all the world perceive
				that they were dearer friends than ever; so, making a virtue of necessity, he looked
				in her face with one of his wittiest smiles, and cleverly taking the cue she had
				given, replied — "If you had <hi>not</hi> found out that I was jesting with you,
				Lady Clarissa, I never should have believed in your friendship more! Come here, my
				boy," he continued, raising his loud voice to a note that must have been heard as
				far as the factory, "come here, I say."</p>
			<p>The little fellow, on hearing these imperative accents, which were not quite unknown
				to him, thought this was the first time he had been so greatly honoured as to have
				them addressed to himself, again let go the hand of his brother, by whose side he
				had begun to resume his progress homeward, and once more clambering over the gate,
				presented himself, cap in hand, before the illustrious pair.</p>
			<p>"You are a happy little boy," said Lady Clarissa, "in having had the extraordinary
				good fortune of looking over yonder gate at the moment you did; and you are a brave
				little fellow into the bargain for not running away, as you certainly might have
				done, when you saw that dreadful beast. Oh! those tremendous horns, Sir Matthew!
				they haunt me still! I am quite sure it will be weeks before I lay my head on my
				pillow without dreaming of them. But you drove them away, my dear child, and as a
				reward for it, you shall be comfortably clothed and fed for the rest of your life.
				You will like that, won't you?"</p>
			<p>"I should very much like never to go to work at the factory any more," replied the
				child; "but, please ma'am." he added the minute after, "I'd sooner you'd clothe and
				feed Teddy than me. He looked over the gate first, please ma'am."</p>
			<p>"Did he, my dear? Then that is another reason why this good gentleman's favour should
				be shown to you; for if your brother saw my distress first, it was you who were the
				first to relieve it."</p>
			<p>"That was only because Teddy is so lame, please ma'am," said the boy.</p>
			<p>"Lame, is he?" repeated her ladyship, "Poor fellow! However, my little man, if I do
				not greatly mistake, you have this day made a friend by serving me, who will put you
				in a situation where, if you behave well, you will be able to assist all who belong
				to you."</p>
			<p>The child opened a pair of remarkably large eyes, and fixing them on her face, said,
				"What! mother and all?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, I should think so, my dear. He is a fine intelligent looking little fellow, is
				he not, Sir Matthew? But he does not look healthy. However, I dare say he will
				improve in that respect. Plenty of food generally cures all poor people's
				complaints, particularly when they are young. How old are you, my dear?"</p>
			<p>"Nine last birthday," replied the boy.</p>
			<pb n="17"/>
			<p>"A tall little fellow for his age, though very thin, to be sure. And what is your
				name?"</p>
			<p>"Michael Armstrong, ma'am."</p>
			<p>"Michael Armstrong: I shall not forget it, I assure you; for truly do I believe that
				I should have been trampled in the dust by this time, if you had not been
				heart-strong as well as Armstrong. And what shall we do with him at first, Sir
				Matthew? Shall we take him home with us?"</p>
			<p>"What! to your cottage, my dear lady? — Yes, certainly, if it will give you
				pleasure."</p>
			<p>"My dearest Sir Matthew! there you are at your jestings again."</p>
			<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Lady Clarissa, you begin to know me so well, that I shall never be able
				to cut my little dry jokes upon you," replied the knight laughing, as it seemed,
				most heartily, but inwardly cursing the audacious exaction of his fair friend, in
				attempting to make him pay the enormous price she hinted at, for permitting him to
				enjoy the honour and glory of flirting with her. The idea of being thus entrapped,
				and forced to adopt " <hi>a bag of rags out of his own factory</hi> " (for it was
				thus he inwardly designated little Michael), galled him for a moment so severely,
				that he was within an ace of exclaiming, " <hi>Confound you, and the beggar's brat
					together, you old fool!</hi> " But, most fortunately for all parties, he did no
				such thing; on the contrary, he happily remembered at that critical moment the
				important hints he had received from his excellent friend Dr. Crockley, and
				instantly decided "that this absurd whim of her ladyship's should be worked up into
				the d — d good-natured thing that was to set all right."</p>
			<p>At the very same moment, as if to confirm his resolution, Lady Clarissa drew from her
				pocket a cambric pocket-handkerchief, something the worse for wear, perhaps, but
				most elaborately embroidered at each corner with the coronet of a countess. It was
				one of a dozen bequeathed to her a few years before by her thrifty and truly
				admirable mother, the late Countess of Highlandloch. This coincidence appeared to be
				the work of Providence.</p>
			<p>"Give me your arm, my charming friend!" said the well-satisfied knight, with an air
				of tender gallantry, "and only remember, that all I shall do in this business, will
				proceed wholly from my devoted friendship to you. Follow us, little boy, and you
				shall learn what it is to have served Sir Matthew Dowling's most honoured
				friend."</p>
			<p>Having said this, he began leading his fair companion back towards the house as
				rapidly as might be consistent with the delicate style in which she was shod.</p>
			<p>"Please ma'am, may I go and tell Teddy?" said little Michael, walking after them.</p>
			<p> "Teddy? — who is Teddy, my little man?" inquired Lady Clarissa, graciously smiling
				upon him; for her ladyship, at no time an ill-natured woman, was at this moment in
				the best of all possible humours with herself, and every body else. There had been
				various passages in what had passed between herself and Sir <pb n="18"/> Matthew,
				during this most delightful walk, which convinced her that the knight,
				notwithstanding the homage he paid to her rank, could not wholly resist the
				fascinations of her person, talents, and manners; — and the conviction pleased her.
				But let not the character of this noble lady be for a moment misunderstood. Lucretia
				herself would hardly have shrunk with greater horror from an improper attachment.
				All she dreamed of in her intimacy with Sir Matthew Dowling, with the young poet,
				Osmund Norval, and with a few other gentlemen whom she was in the habit of meeting,
				was but that their admiring friendship should be animated by a lambent, innoxious
				flickering of the flame, which, after a peculiar theory of her own, she believed to
				pervade the universe, cheering the well-conducted by its mild platonic warmth, but
				scorching, burning, and destroying those who permitted it to exercise over them a
				too-sovereign sway and masterdom. That she had reached the age of forty, unsolicited
				in marriage by any suitor of any degree, she attributed, rightly enough perhaps, to
				the unfortunate disproportion between her fortune and her rank — but must she,
				therefore, live and die without the sweet consciousness of having been loved? Where
				was the law that enforced such cruelty? She knew it not; and accordingly had, for
				many years, and quite upon principle, made up her mind to permit as many gentlemen,
				of all ages, ranks, and conditions, to deserve "the soft impeachment," whether they
				owned it or not, as it was in her power to captivate. For most of these tender and
				really very innocent friendships, she was able to assign to herself some excellent
				cause — as poetical sympathy with one, botanical sympathy with another,
				philosophical religious sympathy with a third, and so on; but in the case of Sir
				Matthew Dowling, she sometimes felt a little puzzled herself. </p>
			<p>It was not, however, that she was weak enough in the least degree to blame herself
				for wishing to be admired by a vulgar man. She had long ago given such feelings to
				the winds. From the time she quitted, on the death of her mother, the floods and the
				fells of her native land, to inhabit a pretty little cottage (the timely gift of an
				English godmother), which happened to be situated in the midst of a manufacturing
				district, she had been schooling her spirit to endure the change from poor lairds of
				a hundred descents, to rich manufacturers, who would have been, for the most part,
				quite as pleased had they been unable to trace one. Just at first, her Scotch pride
				rebelled a little; but an hour or two of quiet meditation on the subject, led her to
				perceive so clearly all she might lose, and all she might gain, by being or not
				being on friendly terms with her neighbours, that she made up her mind on the matter
				at once, and thenceforward feasted upon delicate cates, and battened in the
				fructifying sunshine of universal popularity, in a neighbourhood that might be
				safely described as the richest in the world.</p>
			<p> But still this did not quite explain the terms she was upon with Sir Matthew
				Dowling, and she did feel sometimes conscious of taking more pains to please him
				than she quite knew why — unconscious that it arose from a latent wish to be
				distinguished by a man, <pb n="19"/> celebrated for the warmth of his devotion to
				the fair sex. But for this, she must not be out of measure blamed, inasmuch as those
				who have reached the age for looking on upon the drama of life, can many of them
				testify that in this she only yielded to a weakness very unaccountably common to the
				majority of the sex. </p>
			<p>But poor little Michael Armstrong has been left unmercifully long, looking up in her
				ladyship's smiling face, as she inquired who Teddy was.</p>
			<p>"Teddy is my brother, please ma'am," was his answer.</p>
			<p>"Is he still waiting for you at the gate, my dear?" said the lady. "I don't see
				him."</p>
			<p>"He can't stand very well, ma'am, because he is lame," replied Michael. "I shouldn't
				wonder if he was set down, and gone to sleep."</p>
			<p>"Gone to sleep! — why it is hardly bedtime yet, my dear, is it? However, I suppose he
				had better go to see, Sir Matthew? — Your brother," turning again to the child, "is
				younger than you are, I suppose, if he falls asleep on the grass like a baby. Is he
				old enough to go home by himself, and tell the great news that has happened to
				you?"</p>
			<p>"Teddy is two years older than me — only he is always so tired," replied the boy.</p>
			<p>"Well, then, just step back, and bid him run along home by himself, and tell all the
				family what a fine act you have done, and that Sir Matthew Dowling is going to take
				care of you all the rest of your life."</p>
			<p>Michael now, for the first time, ventured to look steadily up into the face of the
				majestic Sir Matthew, and his little heart sank within him. It was quite evident
				from the child's speaking-countenance, that no pleasurable ideas were suggested, by
				the assurance that Sir Matthew would take care of him all the rest of his life. The
				knight saw this, and would for a moment have desired no better sport than wringing
				his neck round; nevertheless, he patted his head with astonishing condescension, and
				said, "It is quite true, my boy. For the sake of this charming lady, for whose
				happiness you must pray morning, noon, and night, I will undertake to provide for
				you. You may step back, if you will, and tell your brother so, who, if he be two
				years older than you, will be able to make your friends understand the good fortune
				that has happened to you."</p>
			<p>"I have got no friends, please sir," said the boy.</p>
			<p>"Where do you live then?"</p>
			<p>"With mother, sir."</p>
			<p>"Is not she your friend, my poor child?" demanded Lady Clarissa in an accent of great
				feeling.</p>
			<p>"Please ma'am, she is my mother," answered Michael, while a slight flash mantled his
				pale cheek, and something like a tear twinkled in his eye.</p>
			<p>"How very odd!" exclaimed Lady Clarissa. "Is she not kind to you, my boy?"</p>
			<p>"Kind?" responded Michael, staring at her.</p>
			<pb n="20"/>
			<p>"Do you love her, my little fellow?"</p>
			<p>"Love her?" again echoed Michael.</p>
			<p>"Whatever she is, she has not taught you good manners, my lad, or you would not
				answer her ladyship this way," said the knight rather indignantly.</p>
			<p>The little boy was certainly very foolish, for, large as his eyes were, they could
				not contain the salt rheum which, for no reason in the world that the lady or
				gentleman could guess, first filled them and then ran down in two great big drops
				upon his cheeks.</p>
			<p>"I dare say he is hungry," exclaimed Lady Clarissa with sudden animation. "How
				delightful, dearest Sir Matthew, to have found a little creature so greatly in want!
				Are you hungry, my dear? Tell the truth — don't be afraid."</p>
			<p>"Not very," said the child.</p>
			<p>"Poor little fellow! — It is quite evident, Sir Matthew, that he is exceedingly shy.
				Let us go back, shall we? — just as far as the gate, and give the message ourselves
				to that lazy fellow that he says is asleep under the hedge — and two years older
				than this one. — Only conceive! — I am delighted that <hi>he</hi> is not to be the
				object of your bounty, for there is nothing so detestable as idleness."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew had turned in compliance with the word and action, which expressed her
				ladyship's desire that he should do so, and in another minute they reached the
				gate.</p>
			<p>"Where is this brother of yours? — I don't see him," said Lady Clarissa, looking
				about.</p>
			<p>"There he is, ma'am, if you please," replied Michael, once more climbing over the
				gate; and presently he was close under the flowery hedge, extending his two hands to
				raise a miserably sicklooking child, who was, in truth, soundly sleeping there. In
				consequence of a few words whispered to him by little Michael, the boy came forward
				with a shuffling gait, his knees sloping inwards, and his legs frightfully
				emaciated: but the moment he reached the gate, Lady Clarissa exclaimed, "Good
				gracious! how beautiful!"</p>
			<p>It was indeed a lovely face that was then turned up to meet her eye; and when, as if
				somewhat daunted by her earnest gaze, he removed his own from her countenance to
				that of Sir Matthew, the bright flash that lighted it up for a moment made it appear
				more beautiful still.</p>
			<p>"And what is your name, my pretty boy?" said the lady.</p>
			<p>"Edward Armstrong," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"But, my dear child, you don't look well, and you ought not to go to sleep so, quite
				late in the evening, upon the grass. What makes you so very sleepy, my dear? Have
				you been at play?"</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am," replied the boy, furtively glancing at Sir Matthew, "I have been at
				work."</p>
			<p>"At work! You can't have done much work, my poor little fellow, looking as you
				do."</p>
			<p>"I have been at work since" — </p>
			<p> "My dear Lady Clarissa, I really will not let you stay another moment," suddenly
				exclaimed Sir Matthew. "The heat is gone <pb n="21"/> off, and I am sure you will be
				quite chilled if you remain any longer out of doors." </p>
			<p>"I believe you are right, my dear friend," said Lady Clarissa, with a glance of
				affectionate gratitude for this earnest zeal. "Let us go. Never can I forget the
				kindness you have shown me during this eventful walk, and heartless indeed must I be
				were I to refuse to acknowledge that it has made a deep impression on me."</p>
			<p>For a moment Lady Clarissa held her coroneted handkerchief to her eyes, and then
				resumed. "Go home, little Edward — tell your mother, who, by the by, I trust is not
				harsh to you, that your brother Michael is rewarded for an act of bravery that
				probably saved the life of an earl's daughter — has been most generously and nobly
				adopted by her friend Sir Matthew Dowling, and that henceforward she need have no
				anxiety whatever on his account. Now, then, Sir Matthew, I am ready."</p>
			<p>"Are we never to see Michael again?" said the lame boy, while a sudden expression of
				anguish passed across his beautiful features.</p>
			<p>"Why not, child?" replied her ladyship rather sharply. "Do you suppose that Sir
				Matthew and I are going to hide him?"</p>
			<p>"It is all very well then," returned Edward, limping away. "But be sure to go and
				tell mother all about it yourself to-morrow, Mike."</p>
			<p>"Come along, little one!" said Lady Clarissa, moving off. "Follow behind this
				generous gentleman, and see the palace of a home which your bravery has won."</p>
			<p>So saying, she moved on; the obsequious knight at her side, and the wondering Michael
				Armstrong after her.</p>
			<p>On reaching the gate beside the gardener's house, Sir Matthew paused. He had been
				meditating, while seemingly listening in rapt attention to the lady's talk, on the
				effect which would be produced on the party they were about to rejoin, by the
				appearance of the ragged little companion they had brought back with them.</p>
			<p>Had he been a ragged sailor-boy, or a ragged plough-boy, or even a ragged
				chimney-sweeper, there might by possibility have been excited some feeling of
				curiosity and interest; but a ragged factory-boy was of all created beings the one
				least likely to give birth to such emotions, among his friends and neighbours, or
				indeed to any other emotion fit to be exhibited in good society. So, merely saying
				to his fair friend, "Excuse me, my lady, for one moment," he once more knocked at
				the cottage-window, and called aloud for "Macnab!"</p>
			<p>The obedient North Briton appeared immediately, and was about to forestal the inquiry
				he anticipated by assurances that her ladyship's pines, peaches, and grapes, had all
				been consigned to the care of her ladyship's own serving-man, when he was very
				literally struck dumb by his master saying — </p>
			<p> "Macnab, take this little boy into the servants' hall, and tell the servants to take
				care of him — do you hear? — and he is to have a bed made up for him, and — and
				supper, and breakfast — and all that; and to-morrow I will talk to Parsons about
				what must be done for him. <pb n="22"/> Observe, Macnab, and take care, if you
				please, that all the servants about the place know it, that this boy is to be the
				object of the greatest benevolence." </p>
			<p>"The greatest — what was you pleased to say, sir?" said the Scotch gardener, really
				and truly doubting his own ears.</p>
			<p>" Benevolence , sir!" shouted the knight vehemently; "and woe to any
				one on my estate who dares to question or thwart my design!"</p>
			<p>"How inspiring is this angelic goodness," exclaimed Lady Clarissa affectionately.
				"Ah, Sir Matthew! how few there are who know you as I know you!"</p>
			<p>"Come along, my man," said the Scotchman, leading away Michael; and he said no more
				till he was quite sure that the knight and the lady had got far enough in their
				progress across the garden, to be out of hearing, and then he added: "And now, my
				little fellow, tell me in God's name what all this means? Why, you look for all the
				world like one of the little raggamuffins out of the factory."</p>
			<p>"I <hi>am</hi> one of the raggamuffins out of the factory," replied Michael.</p>
			<p>"You are? and our master's going to make a house-pet of ye? Why, now, you'll be made
				the talk of the whole country. I should not have been one-half so much surprised if
				he had taken one of our sucking pigs into the drawing-room."</p>
			<p>"Nor I, sir," said Michael timidly, but with half a smile.</p>
			<p>"So, then, you don't understand it much better than I do, it seems? But what did he
					<hi>say</hi> it was for? He didn't take the Earl of Highlandloch's daughter
				among the infernal whirligigs, did he, and pick you out as a specimen to be kept in
				a glass case?"</p>
			<p>"I hope he won't put me in a glass case, sir," said Michael, taking courage from the
				gardener's good-humour; "but why he brought me here at all, I don't very well
				understand. The lady said it was because I held up my hat, and cried 'Wough!' to
				Dame Knight's old cow: but of course she was only making fun."</p>
			<p>"At any rate, he was making no fun, for he roared like a bulldog, didn't he? So his
				bidding I'll do, let it mean what it will; and if it brings you food and lodging, I
				don't suppose you'll break your heart for being taken out of the factory — shall
				you?"</p>
			<p>"Not if he'll take Edward out too," said the boy.</p>
			<p>"Edward out too! Oh! Lord, oh! Lord, how many more? Did he cry 'Wough!' to the cow,
				too?"</p>
			<p>"I wish he had!" said Michael, shaking his head very mysteriously.</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p>Meanwhile Lady Clarissa and the gallant knight re-entered my Lady Dowling's
				drawing-room, amidst a perfect storm of questions, exclamations of admiration,
				wonder, fears for the lady's safety, and so forth.</p>
			<p> Miss Brotherton, who always took more liberties than any one else, laughed
				immoderately; Lady Dowling looked the picture of <pb n="23"/> conjugal woe; and good
				Miss Mogg bustled forward with her usual amiable attention, put a footstool under
				the lady's misused white satin shoes, took Mrs. Janet Macnab's shawl off her
				shoulders, and whispered in her ear, that she was dreadfully afraid she must have
				caught cold. </p>
			<p>But Lady Clarissa, with a lively action of both hands at once, not only drove Miss
				Mogg back, but every one else who attempted to crowd round her, saying, "Give me
				space! give me space, I entreat you! I must have 'ample room and verge enough' to
				breathe. Such a series of adventures! Lady Dowling, you have no idea! Good heaven! I
				can hardly believe it myself. I have been in the greatest possible danger of losing
				my life — a beast — a monster — the most terrific animal certainly that nature ever
				permitted on the earth! You know, Mogg, I fear nothing — I have the spirit of my
				race within me. Who ever heard of a Highlandloch being afraid? But I give you my
				honour — I pledge my noble word to you all, that such a monster as that which I have
				escaped from this night, might have made the black Douglas fear!"</p>
			<p>"Or the Earl of Warwick either, perhaps," said Miss Brotherton, for she had heard Sir
				Matthew utter the word "cow," in answer to the importunate inquiries of his eldest
				son.</p>
			<p>"But what shall I say of Sir Matthew Dowling?" resumed Lady Clarissa, with increased
				energy. "Such benevolence! such noble, disinterested conduct! — No, I cannot — I
				really have no strength left. Miss Brotherton, my dear, pray do order your carriage;
				my nerves are in disorder, so is my dress — in short, I long to get home, and
				meditate in solitude on my providential escape."</p>
			<p>Here Lady Clarissa found it necessary to lie down upon a sofa, her faithful Mogg
				endeavouring in vain to pull her dress over her slender feet and ankles, for her
				ladyship was restless, feverish, and unable to remain in the same attitude for a
				minute together.</p>
			<p>Ere long, however, the carriage of the heiress was announced, and the languid Lady
				Clarissa exerted herself to reach it, with the aid of Miss Mogg's substantial arm on
				one side, and that of Sir Matthew Dowling on the other.</p>
			<p>"Farewell, my friend!" she uttered with some effort, after taking her seat: "ere long
				I shall call upon you, and shall hope to see our interesting protegé looking very
				differently from what he did when we parted from him. Farewell! I do assure you I am
				almost fainting! Do ask — will you, dear Sir Matthew? — if the fruit, the pines
				particularly, are put in. I really think they will do me good, and I am sure I want
				it. Thank you! thank you! Adieu!</p>

			<head> CHAPTER III. </head>
			<p>INTRODUCTION OF MICHAEL ARMSTRONG INTO THE FAMILY OF SIR MATTHEW DOWLING —
				CONJECTURES CONCERNING HIS PARENTAGE — A CONFABULATION BETWEEN SIR MATTHEW AND MR.
				JOSEPH PARSONS.</p>
			<p>
				When Mr. Macnab and his little companion entered the kitchen, in
				their way to the servants' hall, to which place of honour the wondering Scotchman
				remembered he had been commanded to conduct his charge, the first person they
				encountered was Mr. Simkins, the butler, whom some accidental wish or want had led
				to enter a region but rarely honoured by the sunshine of his presence.</p>
			<p>"Good morning, Macnab. What! empty-handed? I am afraid you have forgotten the little
				basket of peaches I desired to have; and upon my word, sir, if you leave it much
				longer, I shall not consider them worth presenting to the lady for whom I desired to
				have them. Be pleased to recollect, good Mr. Sawney, that when every garden-wall is
				hung with ripe fruit, a bottle of comfort will be rather too high a price for a
				dozen."</p>
			<p>"Your discourse, Mr. Simkins, is neither civil nor discreet in any way," replied the
				offended North Briton: "my word, sir, is as good as the bank, either in England or
				Scotland; and it is beneath a gentleman, to say nothing of your rank as a butler,
				Mr. Simkins, to suspect that I should forget it."</p>
			<p>"Well, well, the sooner the better, that's all. But who in God's name have you got
				here?"</p>
			<p>"That is more than I am able to tell you, sir," replied Macnab. "All I know about him
				is a mystery. Sir Matthew, and a lady that was hardly born to be so free in his
				company, came to the garden-house about an hour ago, and Sir Matthew was as gay as a
				lark, and ambled and smirked; while the Highlandloch's daughter, old fool! looked as
				well pleased as if she had been gallanted by the Duke of Argyle. Well, sir, he
				ordered a basket of the choicest and best for her ladyship, and it went against me,
				Mr. Simkins, both ways — for first it ought to choke her, seeing who she is, and who
				he is, and next I thought upon my promise to you, sir. However, and nevertheless,
				Mr. Simkins, I will keep my word with you, if it cost me a ton of coals more in the
				forcing."</p>
			<p>"But what's all this to do with your ragged companion there? The child looks as if he
				was ready to drop. I'll bet a bottle you caught him thieving in the
				fruit-garden."</p>
			<p> The boy's colour rose on hearing these words. He spoke not, however; but his large
				eyes were turned up to the face of his companion, and the fingers of his little hand
				pressed the hard palm that held them, almost convulsively. Sawney understood the
				appeal, and answered it: for though, like many other gentlemen, his code of <pb n="25"/> honour was at some points a little loosened and enlarged, to fit and
				suit his individual circumstances, he felt the value of character as much as any
				man; and promptly replied, in good Scotch, which must, however, for sundry weighty
				reasons, be here translated into English: "No, no, Mr. Butler! no such thing, I
				assure you; the lad's as honest as I am, for aught that I know to the contrary. But,
				to make a short story of a long one, my lady walked off up the lane, after borrowing
				a shawl from my wife, and your master with her, Mr. Simkins, who but he — Well, I
				had picked the fruit, packed it, and delivered it over to my lady's man, and was
				just set down again to my seed-picking, when I heard Sir Matthew's big voice again
				halloaing to me, and when I came out, there stood the ill-sorted pair, arm in arm
				together, as before, and this ragged chap beside them." </p>
			<p>"Well! and what then?" ejaculated the portly butler, impatiently. "What a long-winded
				man you are, Macnab."</p>
			<p>"Hoot, man!" retorted Macnab, "if you want the story, you must just find patience to
				hear it. 'Take this boy to the servants' hall,' said Sir Matthew, quite upon the
				strut, 'and order supper and a bed for him.'"</p>
			<p>"To the servants' hall?" repeated the indignant man of bottles, measuring the little
				fellow from head to foot with an eye, which, notwithstanding it was small and
				bloodshot, was eloquent of scorn. "To the servants' hall? Sir Matthew will inflict
				his own company upon us next, I suppose. Why, look at the cotton fluff mixed with
				his hair! He is neither more nor less than a factory-boy."</p>
			<p>"To be sure he is," replied the gardener, shrugging his shoulders, "but it's no fault
				of mine, Mr. Simkins; to the servants' hall I must take him, right or wrong. Come
				along, boy."</p>
			<p>"Stop one moment, if you please, Macnab. Let me step to Mrs. Thompson's room, and
				speak one word to her about it. Sit down, sit down, will you, for one moment." And
				away hurried Mr. Simkins, scattering dismay as he traversed the passages, by
				uttering as he passed along to footmen and housemaids, abigail and page, "Go to the
				kitchen, do, in God's name! go and see the company Sir Matthew has been ordering
				into the servants' hall!"</p>
			<p>And away they flew, one after another, eager to see the wonder; so that by the time
				Mr. Simkins himself returned to the kitchen, marshalling the housekeeper before him,
				at least half-a-dozen servants had assembled there, all of whom were gazing at
				little Michael, very much as if he had been caught in a forest, and conveyed thither
				to gratify their desire of studying natural history.</p>
			<p>"Who is that dirty little boy, Macnab?" said the magnificent Mrs. Thompson, advancing
				to the spot where the gardener was seated with his frightened charge standing beside
				him, and all the lookers-on making way for her as she passed.</p>
			<p>"It is a factory-boy sent here by Sir Matthew, Mrs. Thompson," replied Macnab, while,
				forestalling, it may be, the storm likely to follow the intelligence, he seemed to
				settle himself in the arm-chair either to enjoy the fun, or abide the tempest.</p>
			<pb n="26"/>
			<p>But he was, as it should seem, mistaken as to Mrs. Thompson's feelings; for that
				lady, though usually considered by the subordinates as somewhat warm in temper,
				appeared on this occasion to be as mild as a lamb.</p>
			<p>"A factory-boy, certainly," she replied with the dignity that was peculiar to her,
				"nobody is likely to doubt <hi>that</hi> , Mr. Macnab; one might know his calling at
				half a mile's distance. The vulgar factory itself, with its millions of windows, is
				not more easily known than the things that crawl out of it, with their millions of
				cotton specks — that is not the main point of the question, Mr. Macnab: it is not
				what the boy is, but who he is, and for what reason any one has dared to say that he
				was to sup in the servants' hall."</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear me, ma'am," replied the gardener, endeavouring to look very grave, "that
				wasn't one half of it. To you, ma'am, it's my duty to repeat Sir Matthew's words
				exact, and this is what he said. 'Macnab,' or 'Mr. Macnab,' for he calls me both at
				times, 'take this little boy,' says he, 'into the servants' hall, and tell every
				body there to take care of him — every body to take care of him' — that was it, Mrs.
				Thompson, word for word. And then he went on: 'He is to have a bed,' says he, 'made
				up on purpose for him, and he is to be waited upon with supper and breakfast,' and a
				great deal more, that Mr. Parsons is to make known to-morrow. But you have not heard
				all yet, ma'am," continued Macnab, raising his voice, on perceiving that the stately
				housekeeper was putting herself in act to speak. "Sir Matthew went on, raising his
				arm like one of his own steam-engines, 'Observe, Mr. Macnab,' says he, 'and take
				care that all the servants, little and great, know it, that <hi>this boy is to be
					the object of the greatest benevolence</hi> .' That's something new for you,
				Mrs. Thompson, isn't it?"</p>
			<p>"Sir Matthew may settle about his benevolence with himself, when he is in his own pew
				at church," replied Mrs. Thompson, with a very satirical sort of smile; "but most
				certainly it shall not be brought to dirty my premises; so let me hear no more about
				it, gardener, if you please." And with these words, she turned haughtily away.</p>
			<p>"But, ma'am — Mrs. Thompson, you had better stop if you please, for go I must, if
				that's your answer, and tell Sir Matthew of it."</p>
			<p> If Mr. Macnab had been a blacksmith instead of a gardener, he might have been less
				surprised at the phenomena which followed these words; for he would have known that
				white heat is stronger than red heat, though it does not look so fierce. He had
				fancied the housekeeper particularly calm and placable upon this occasion, because,
				forsooth, she looked rather pale than red when she entered the kitchen; but no
				sooner had he uttered this threat of reporting her words to Sir Matthew, than the
				fact of her being in an exceedingly terrible rage became evident. Notwithstanding
				the usual dignified gentility of her manner, on which, indeed, when more
				self-possessed, she greatly prided herself, she clenched her fists, raised her arms
				on high, and from one of the most imposing housekeepers <pb n="27"/> in the British
				dominions, suddenly assumed the aspect of an inspired fury. </p>
			<p>"Tell! — You? — Sir Matthew? — Blackguard! scoundrel! — base-born spinning spider! —
				I, that have lived with the Duke of Clarington!"</p>
			<p>"'Tis two, too bad, and that's the fact!" exclaimed my Lady Dowling's own footman,
				who always sided with the principal person in company, which gave him very much the
				air of being a superior person himself; "and if I was Mrs. Thompson, I'd throw my
				salary in the vulgar fellow's face, before I'd bear to have a factory-boy pushed
				into my company."</p>
			<p>"And so I will, Mr. Jennings, you may depend upon it," replied the incensed prime
				ministeress, somewhat softened: "so now, Mr. Macnab, you may just take yourself off,
				and leave the brat in the kitchen, or take him away with you, as you like best."</p>
			<p>"I have done my share of the <hi>benevolent</hi> job, so I will wish you good night,
				Mrs. Thompson; and whether this little fellow eats his supper and breakfast in the
				kitchen or the hall, it will be much the same to him, I fancy." So saying, the
				gardener rose, and giving a sort of general nod to the company, left the
				kitchen.</p>
			<p>Considering that there had been nothing very affectionate in the nature of the
				intercourse which had taken place between them, it was rather singular that the
				little Michael should feel as sorry as he did at the departure of Mr. Macnab. But he
				did feel sorry, and when the door shut after him, he turned away, and hid his face
				with his uplifted arm.</p>
			<p>Pride of place, and elevation of character, having been in a considerable degree
				satisfied by Mrs. Thompson's energetic expression of her feelings, something like
				curiosity awoke within her to learn what the circumstances had been which had
				induced Sir Matthew Dowling to declare an intention of acting benevolently. For a
				moment she struggled against it, and again seemed about to leave the room; but as
				she turned her eyes upon the child, she seemed to feel that before one so very
				abject, no loss of importance could be feared, even if she did question him. So,
				with the air of a judge walking up to the bench, she stalked onwards to the seat Mr.
				Macnab had left, and placing her austere person in it, made a signal with her hand,
				that the kitchen-maid who had ventured to approach the little boy should stand back,
				and leave her space to examine him.</p>
			<p> On one side of this space stood the lordly butler, with his arms folded, and a look
				of scorn upon his countenance that seemed to question the propriety of the measure
				Mrs. Thompson had thought proper to adopt. On the other was the courtly Jennings,
				with an arm resting upon her chair, as if to give evidence that he was near at hand
				to support her. An extremely fat and very professional-looking cook came next, while
				my lady's own maid, with all the elegant superiority of attire which marks the
				station, held a scent-bottle to her nose, that the curiosity which led her to be a
				witness <pb n="28"/> of this extraordinary scene, might be punished with as little
				suffering as possible. Two sprightly housemaids seemed to find something vastly
				amusing in the whole business, though their evident merriment was restrained by the
				solemnity of Mrs. Thompson's manner. </p>
			<p>"Look up in my face, little boy," said the housekeeper, as soon as she had seated
				herself and saw that those around her stood still, as if they had taken their
				places, and were prepared to listen.</p>
			<p>Michael did not move; he was probably ashamed to show that he was weeping, before the
				face of a lady who spoke so very grandly.</p>
			<p>The kitchen-maid gave him a nudge, but a gentle one, whispering at the same time — "
				Look up, my boy. What be you 'feard of? There's nobody as wants to hurt you
				here."</p>
			<p>Thus encouraged, Michael let his arm drop by his side, and discovered a face that was
				indeed sallow, and by no means very plump, but with features and expression which,
				whatever Sir Matthew Dowling's men and maids might think of it, might have sufficed
				to make the fortune of an able painter.</p>
			<p>"Whose child are you?" demanded the housekeeper. "Mother's," replied the boy.</p>
			<p>"I suspected as much," rejoined the inquisitor, half aside to Mr. Jennings.</p>
			<p>"And I beant no ways surprised to hear it, I promise you," he replied.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Thompson sighed deeply. "It is dreadful!" said she. Then, after taking a moment
				to recover herself, she resumed, "And where does the unhappy person live?"</p>
			<p>"Please, ma'am, who?" said the puzzled boy.</p>
			<p>"The — your mother, child. — Shame upon you for forcing me to name her!"</p>
			<p>Michael gave a little shake of the head, which seemed to the merciful kitchen-maid to
				say, that he did not know what the great lady meant; but he presently replied, as if
				discreetly determined to mind only what he did understand, "Mother lives in Hoxley
				Lane, ma'am."</p>
			<p>"The most deplorable situation in the whole parish! inhabited only by the
					<hi>very</hi> lowest!" observed the housekeeper, with another indignant
				sigh.</p>
			<p>"So much the worse for she," muttered the kitchen-maid; but not loud enough to be
				heard by her in whose hands rested the appointment of kitchen-maids as well as
				cooks.</p>
			<p>"And why does such as you come here?" resumed the housekeeper.</p>
			<p>"Because the squire ordered t'other man to bring me," answered Michael.</p>
			<p> "I suspect that the boy is a natural fool," observed Mrs. Thompson, addressing the
				butler. "It is a sure fact, and a great dispensation — bad parents have almost
				always children out of <pb n="29"/> shape, both mind and body. You may take my word
				for that, all of you," she added, looking round her; "and you will do well to teach
				it to your children after you." </p>
			<p>"I'll be burnt if I don't think it very likely that it was his own father sent him
				here, and no one else," said Mr. Jennings, chuckling.</p>
			<p>"Fie! Jennings, fie!" returned Mrs. Thompson, with a frown. "God in heaven only knows
				what may have been the cause of it! — Not but what it does look strange, there's no
				denying that."</p>
			<p>"Do you know any thing about your father, child?" said Mr. Simkins in a magisterial
				tone.</p>
			<p>"Father's in heaven," replied the child.</p>
			<p>"Mercy on me! do you hear him? Is not that like mocking the Lord's prayer?" exclaimed
				the lady's-maid.</p>
			<p>"No, it is not!" said Michael, while a flash of youthful indignation rushed into his
				face. "My father is in heaven along with God."</p>
			<p>"I dare say he means that his father is dead," observed the butler with an air of
				great sagacity; "and if what has been jealoused at is correct," he added, winking
				his eye at Mr. Jennings, "it is very natural that he should have been told to say
				so."</p>
			<p>"That's very true," said the housekeeper, "and it may be, certainly, that the child
				knows nothing about it whatever, either one way or t'other — indeed I think it's a
				good deal the most likely that he does not; — but, any how, it's a very shocking
				business, and, as far as I am concerned, I'll neither make nor meddle in the matter.
				— Of course, the men-servants may do just as they like about taking notice of him —
				for here he is, and here he will bide, I dare say; but I recommend the maids to
				follow my example, and not to injure their characters, nor to corrupt their morals
				by having any thing to do with the offspring of — It is more decent not to finish
				what I was going to say for your goods, young women, — and lucky it is that there is
				no need. You must all understand me without it."</p>
			<p>Mrs. Thompson then rose from her chair, and turning her eyes, and indeed her head,
				aside, to prevent herself from again seeing Michael, she walked with a degree of
				stateliness and majesty that few housekeepers ever attained, through the kitchen,
				along the passage, across the servants' hall, into the sacred shelter of her own
				parlour, where she gave way to emotions which rendered a glass of prime London
				Madeira absolutely necessary.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Michael remained in no very happy condition in the kitchen. He was very
				tired, very sleepy, very thirsty, very much longing to see his mother and brother,
				and very greatly puzzled as to himself.</p>
			<p>But though accounted to be a brave little fellow for his age, he could not muster
				courage enough to ask any question of those around him, and if he had, it would have
				been of no avail; for the very moment Mrs. Thompson was out of sight, so many of the
				servants began talking together, that no sounds his voice could produce would have
				been heard.</p>
			<p> Jokes and gibes about Sir Matthew, mingled with ridiculous anecdotes, and very
				cordial abuse of him and all his race, furnished <pb n="30"/> the first subject, and
				filled the first chorus. Then followed some facetious observations from Mr. Jennings
				concerning Mrs. Thompson, and a few of her peculiarities; and it was in the midst of
				the giggling which these occasioned, that the kitchen-maid ventured to say — </p>
			<p>"Well, now, you are all so keen, and so clever about her, that I wonder it don't come
				into your heads to find out that she spoke just like an old fool and no better, when
				she invented all that rigmarole about the boy. Master might be just the devil you
				says he is, and ten times worser too, for any thing I know about him; but the worser
				he is, the father I'd be, if I was such a mighty good gentlewoman as she thinks
				herself, from giving such a bad father out of my own invention to any body — whether
				they comed out of the factory or not."</p>
			<p>"I do think Molly's right," said one of the housemaids. — "What business has the old
				frump to find a father for him? Nobody asked her."</p>
			<p>"That may be all very true, Rebecca," observed the lady's-maid, shaking her head very
				gravely. "I know well enough, that Mrs. Thompson does not always wait for right and
				reason before she speaks — but that makes no difference as to our having any
				familiarity with this dirty little boy; for it certainly does appear plain enough,
				that his mother is very little better than she ought to be."</p>
			<p>"Lord bless us! and how much better be you than you ought to be, I should like to
				know?" said the fat cook, who had her own reasons for not being at all partial to
				Mrs. Wittington, her ladyship's waiting-maid.</p>
			<p>"I! — You miserable lump of kitchen-stuff, that no man in his senses would ever deign
				to look upon twice! Do you dare to say that I'm no better than I ought to be?"</p>
			<p>Now the cook was an Irishwoman; and though she had famous black eyes, and teeth like
				an elephant, her principal claim to the coveted attentions of the other sex (setting
				aside the attractions which it is but fair to presume her profession gave her),
				arose from the ready sauciness of her tongue, which, in a brogue as strong as that
				of the Scotch gardener, and equally dangerous for the untaught to meddle with, was
				wont to rattle about her, right and left, sometimes scolding, but oftener making
				sport of all who crossed her humour.</p>
			<p> Now this virtuous outbreak of Mrs. Wittington, was too fair an opportunity to be
				lost; and accordingly, putting on as demure a look as her wicked eyes would let her,
				she replied, "You be better than you ought to be, be you? Well now, that's a trouble
				for your conscious, isn't it? — Is there nobody as can help her out of it? — Think
				what it is, gentlemen, to be so burdened, and she, poor soul, unable to confess to a
				priest, seeing she's a heretic! — Oh! she's better than she ought to be! and you've
				her own word for it too, and that's the reason you see why she's obliged, whether
				she will or no, to turn her back on this poor little fellow, just because he's
				fatherless. Isn't that a sore strait for a young lady's conscious? — Praise <pb n="31"/> and glory to the Holy Virgin, and all the company of saints, now and
				for ever more, that I beant one bit better than I ought to be, and I hope you beant
				neither, Molly; and so just run to the larder, will you, girl, and bring out
				something for supper, fit for a hungry little boy, that havn't the misfortune to be
				so burdened in mind as pretty Mrs. Wittington. — Oh! the poor soul! she's better
				than she ought to be!" </p>
			<p>Molly, the kitchen-maid, did not wait for a second order; and if a capital dish of
				cold cutlets could have set little Michael's heart at rest, he might then have been
				a very happy fellow; but, in truth, he was longing for his own porridge, by his own
				mother's bedside; and except from the relief afforded by a copious draught of milk,
				he went to the bed prepared for him by his friend, the kitchen-maid, so little
				elated in spirit, and so little thankful for the extraordinary change which had
				befallen him, that, had his noble patroness been made aware of it, she would, beyond
				all doubt, have punished his ingratitude, by requesting Sir Matthew to turn him out
				of doors again; and, moreover, have for ever abandoned the generous idea of
				surrounding his young head, as she poetically expressed it, with a halo of
				immortality, by means of getting Mr. Osmund Norval to relate his adventure in
				verse.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew Dowling went to his bed also, hardly better pleased with what had
				occurred than little Michael. But there was this difference between them: little
				Michael said his prayers, which the great Sir Matthew did not; but, on the contrary,
				spent his last waking moment in cursing, with great fervour of spirit, the folly of
				the hideous old maid, who had entailed such a detestable burden upon him — the
				result of which, as a peace-offering to the whole body of operatives, was at any
				rate but problematical.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, when he awoke the next morning with his head quite cool, he felt
				disposed to think more of the hint given him by his friend and favourite Dr.
				Crockley, and less of the inconvenience of having a few pounds to pay out of
				hundreds of thousands for a job, which, if well managed, might help, perhaps, to
				avert a monstrous deal of mischief.</p>
			<p>With these rational thoughts working strongly in his ever-active brain, he rang his
				bell, and ordered that Joseph Parsons, his principal overlooker, should be sent for
				instantly, and shown into his study.</p>
			<p>A short half-hour brought the master and man to a <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> in the snug
				little apartment described in the first chapter.</p>
			<p>"Good morning, Parsons," said Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p>The overlooker bowed his head respectfully.</p>
			<p>"Have you heard any thing of this meeting at the Weavers' Arms, Parsons?" inquired
				Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p>"As much as a man was likely to hear, Sir Matthew, who, as you will easily believe,
				was not intended to hear any thing," replied the confidential servant.</p>
			<p>"And how much was that, Parsons? Sit down, Parsons — sit down, and let us hear all
				about it."</p>
			<pb n="32"/>
			<p>"I was a coming, sir, if you hadn't a sent for me," rejoined the overlooker; "for to
				say truth, my mind misgives me, that there's mischief brewing."</p>
			<p>"I have heard as much," said the master; "but it can hardly have gone very far yet,
				if such a sharp-sighted fellow as you only suspect."</p>
			<p>"That's true, sir," said the man, with a grim smile, in acknowledgment of the
				compliment; "and I've not been idle, I promise you. But all I know for certain is,
				that the people, old and young our own people I mean, have, one and all, taken
				dudgeon about that girl Stephens, that died the week before last, just after leaving
				the mill. She had been at work all day in the spinning-mill, and who was to guess
				that she was that low?"</p>
			<p>"It was a d — d stupid thing though, Parsons, to have a girl go on working, and not
				know whether she was dying or not."</p>
			<p>"And how is one to know, sir? I'll defy any man to find out, what with their tricks,
				and what with their real faintings."</p>
			<p>"You won't tell me, Parsons, that if you set your wits to work, you can't tell
				whether they are shamming or not?"</p>
			<p>"That's not the question, Sir Matthew, asking your pardon. There's no great
				difficulty in finding out whether they are in a real faint, or only making the most
				of being a little sickish from standing, and want of air. That's not the difficulty.
				The thing is to know, when they really take to the downright faintings, whether they
				are likely to live through it or not."</p>
			<p>"And where is the great difficulty of that? You know Dr. Crockley would come at a
				moment's warning at any time, and feel their pulses."</p>
			<p>"And he does do it, sir. But, in the first place, I doubt if any man can justly tell
				whether girls are likely to go on fainting, and up again, as lots and lots of 'em do
				for years, or drop down and die, as Nancy Stephens did. That's one thing; and
				another is, that Dr. Crockley is so fond of a joke, that 'tis rarely one knows when
				he speaks earnest, and when he does not. He <hi>did</hi> see Nancy Stephens, about a
				month ago, and all he said was, 'she do look a little pale in the gills, to be sure,
				but a dance would cure her, I have no doubt.' A dance! says I, doctor. And please to
				tell me, says I, how the work is to get on, if the factory boys and girls sets off
				dancing?"</p>
			<p>"'Maybe you haven't got a fiddle?'" said he.</p>
			<p>"Maybe I haven't," said I.</p>
			<p>"'Well, then,' says he, 'if it don't suit you to let them dance to the fiddle, I'll
				bet ten to one you'll be after making 'em dance to <hi>the strap</hi> .' And with
				that, if you'll believe me, sir, he set off capering, and making antics, just as if
				there had been somebody behind a-strapping him. To be sure, it was fit to make one
				die of laughing to see him; but that's not the way you know, sir, to do one any good
				as to finding out the real condition of the people."</p>
			<pb n="33"/>
			<p>Sir Mathew could not resist a hearty laugh at this characteristic trait of his
				friend, but he concluded by acknowledging that Parsons was quite right in saying
				that this way of doing business was more agreeable than useful.</p>
			<p>"However, Parsons," he continued, "we must not talk about that now, for I have
				something else to say to you. It is quite plain that they are getting again to their
				grumblings; and Crockley, who you know is up to every thing, says that he'll bet his
				life they have got some new mischief into their cursed heads. Now this must be
				prevented, Parsons, some way or other; for any harm they can do the machinery, is
				not the worst of it. — 'Tis the rousing up people's attention again, Parsons,
				there's the danger. — Just see what they've done about the blackamoor slaves, by
				going on boring for everlasting, ding-dong, ding-dong, till they actually got the
				thing done at last. Now the Philadelphy people and the Boston people are just
				playing the very same game t'other side the water; and when they have got their way,
				where will their national wealth be I should like to know? — And where will our
				national wealth be, when these rascals have contrived to stop the mills instead of
				working them?"</p>
			<p>"Lord have mercy upon us! Sir Matthew; — if you don't make me creep all over to hear
				you!" exclaimed Parsons. "'Tis a pity, sir, and often's the time I have said it,
				that you arn't in parliament yourself — you'd pretty soon show 'em what their
				meddling with factories would do for the country."</p>
			<p>"'Tis likely I might, Parsons; but a man can't be in two places at once — and depend
				upon it, there's good to be done here, if we knew how to set about it. I shall make
				you stare, perhaps, Mr. Parsons, when I tell you what I am about now. It came into
				my head by accident at first; but if I don't greatly mistake, I'll make a capital
				thing of it before I have done."</p>
			<p>"There's no doubt of that, Sir Matthew, if you sets your mind to it, let it be what
				it will," replied the confidential overlooker; "and if it isn't a secret, sir, I
				should like uncommon much to hear it."</p>
			<p>"No, it's no secret, Parsons — any thing in the world but that," replied Sir Matthew,
				laughing. "What should you say now, Mr. Superintendent, to my taking a dirty little
				dog of a piecer out of the factory into my own house, and dressing him, and feeding
				him, and lodging him, all for the love of pure benevolence, and little boys?"</p>
			<p>"I don't quite understand you, sir," replied Mr. Joseph Parsons, looking very
				grave.</p>
			<p>"No, I dare say you don't. But I think I do, Parsons, and that's more to the purpose.
				Trust me, man, it will do good if it's only by giving the people something to talk
				of just now, besides this confounded girl's death. And now, my good fellow, tell me
				all you know of a boy called Michael Armstrong, for he you must understand, is the
				hero of my tale."</p>
			<p> "That's the boy, is it? — Then that's why the chap didn't come <pb n="34"/> to work
				this morning," replied Mr. Parsons; "I knows him well enough, Sir Matthew, in
				course; for he's going on for eight or nine, and he comed to the factory just about
				five." </p>
			<p>"And what sort of a boy is he, Parsons?"</p>
			<p>"Nothing very particular, Sir Matthew, unless it is because of the unaccountable fuss
				he makes about his elder brother, who is but a poor rickety, shriveldy sort of a
				child. For some reason or other, his bones never seemed to come rightly straight,
				and this Mike makes as great a fuss about him, as if he was his grandmother."</p>
			<p>"Are the parents living?" inquired Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p>"The mother is. She is a bedridden woman, and ought to be in the workhouse; but she's
				upish, and can't abide it, and so she lies abed, doing plain work and that, and the
				two boys' wages maintains 'em. But I did hear t'other day, she had given in, and was
				a begging to go into the house, and take the eldest boy with her. These creturs
				never know what they would be at. I suspect, howsomever, that she has got hold of a
				notion, that because he's so cripply, he beant to work no more; but I shall take
				care to see Butchel, the parish-overseer, about it. It is altogether a trick that,
				what won't answer — his fingers is just as able to handle the reels, and piece the
				threads as ever they was; and in course, a little dwarf like him, with his legs like
				crooked drumsticks, can't look for any but the youngest wages; so after all, he's
				one of them as answers best."</p>
			<p>"No! Parsons, no! ejaculated Sir Matthew with sudden energy. That woman must not go
				into the workhouse. The whole thing shall be got up, I tell you, in the best
				possible style. What d'ye say now to getting the woman arrested for debt? — or
				having all her things sold? — and we just stepping in at the very nick of time, to
				save her from destruction!"</p>
			<p>There was something so truly comic in the expression of the knight's countenance, as
				he said this, that even the saturnine Mr. Parsons could not help laughing.</p>
			<p>"If the born devils don't sing your praises through the country, sir," said he, as
				soon as he had recovered his gravity, "why we must find some other way to go to work
				with them."</p>
			<p>"Now then be off, Parsons, and contrive some clever scheme or other to throw the
					<hi>unhappy family</hi> into a quandary."</p>
			<p>"I understand, sir," said Parsons, nodding his head, and so parted the master and the
				man.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER IV. </head>
			<p>A LITTLE COTTAGE GOSSIP — A VISIT OF CHARITY — PRACTICAL BENEVOLENCE.</p>
			<p>
				The promptitude of the measures taken by Mr. Joseph Parsons, to
				bring to effect the wishes of his master, showed him to be deserving the post of
				confidence he held, as principal superintendent of Sir Matthew Dowling's factory. He
				lost not a moment in obtaining a short interview with one of the parish-officers,
				who was his particular friend, and then made his way to Hoxley-lane, with the
				intention of questioning the widowed mother of the two Armstrongs, as to the
				situation of her affairs, and the particular species of misery from which she might,
				at that precise moment, be suffering the most.</p>
			<p>The statement pronounced in Sir Matthew's kitchen respecting the general eligibility
				of Hoxley-lane as a place of residence, was perfectly correct. It was the most
				deplorable hole in the parish — a narrow, deep-rutted parish-road (too hopelessly
				bad to be indicted), led from the turnpike down a steep hill to the town of
				Ashleigh. Exactly at the bottom of the hill, just at the point where every summer
				storm and winter torrent deposited their gatherings, there to remain and be absorbed
				as they might, began a long, closely-packed double row of miserable dwellings,
				crowded to excess by the population drawn together by the neighbouring factories.
				There was a squalid, untrimmed look about them all, that spoke fully as much of want
				of care, as of want of cash in the unthrifty tribe who dwelt there. It was like the
				moral delinquencies of a corporate body, of which no man is ashamed, because no man
				can be pointed at as the guilty ONE. It was not the business of No. 1 to look after
				the filth accumulated in front of No. 2; and the inhabitants of No. 3, saw no use in
				mending the gate that swung on one hinge, because No. 4 had no gate at all; and the
				dogs and the pigs who made good their entry there, of course found their way easy
				enough through the make-believe hedge, which throughout the row divided one tenement
				from another. The very vilest rags were hanging before most of the doors, as
				demonstration that washing of garments was occasionally resorted to within. Crawling
				infants, half-starved cats, mangy curs, and fowls that looked as if each particular
				feather had been used as a scavenger's broom, shared the dust and the sunshine
				between them, while an odour, which seemed compounded of a multitude of villanous
				smells, all reeking together into one, floated over them, driving the pure untainted
				air of heaven aloft, far beyond the reach of any human lungs abiding in
				Hoxley-lane.</p>
			<p>"Where does widow Armstrong live?" demanded Mr. Parsons of a woman who was whipping a
				child for tumbling in the dunghill before No. 5.</p>
			<pb n="36"/>
			<p>"In the back kitchen of No. 12, please your honour," replied the woman, making a low
				reverence to the well-known superintendent.</p>
			<p>"No. 12! — why that's Sykes's tenement — and they're on the ground-floor
				themselves."</p>
			<p>"Yes, please your honour; but since the rents have been raised by Sir Matthew, the
				Sykes's have been obliged to let off the back-kitchen, and live in the front
				one."</p>
			<p>"Why there's a matter of a dozen of 'em, isn't there?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, your honour, they lies terrible close."</p>
			<p>"Obstinate dolt-heads! — That's just because they pretend to fancy that it is not
				good for the small children to work — I know, for certain, that they have got two
				above five years, that they won't send to the factory; and then they have the
				outdaciousness to complain that the rents are raised — as if because they are above
				choosing to earn money in an honest way, Sir Matthew was not to make what he could
				of his own. 'Tis disgusting to see such airs, where people ought to be thankful and
				happy to get work."</p>
			<p>"That's quite true, no doubt, sir," answered the woman, continuing to shake, and
				occasionally to slap the grub of a child she had taken off the dunghill. "But Robert
				Sykes's children are very weakly; and them as your honour talks of, is almost too
				small — though 'tisn't to be doubted that it is the bounden duty of us all to send
				'em, sooner than see 'em starve."</p>
			<p>"I fancy so, indeed," replied Mr. Parsons; adding, with a finger pointed at the
				squalling child, who still continued under the cleansing process above described,
				"And isn't it a comfort now, Mrs. Miller, to get rid of the plague of 'em?"</p>
			<p>The woman ceased to shake her little boy, and looking for a moment at the clear blue
				eyes that, notwithstanding her rough discipline, were very lovingly turned up to her
				face — something like a shudder passed over her.</p>
			<p>"Get along in with you, Bill," said she, as if afraid that the blighting glance of
				the superintendent should rest upon him; and then added, "as long as they be so very
				small, your honour, they can't do no good if they be sent."</p>
			<p>"Stuff and nonsense! there's ways to teach 'em. But don't fancy that I want you to
				send your brats — confound 'em! They're the greatest plagues in natur; and nothing
				on God's earth but good-heartedness and love of his country would ever make Sir
				Matthew, for one, trouble himself or his men with any of the creturs. — No. 12, is
				it, where I shall find the widow Armstrong?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, please your honour — you'll be sure to find her. She's a cripple pour soul, and
				can't stir."</p>
			<p>"She's made up her mind to go into the workhouse, hasn't she?" demanded the
				manager.</p>
			<p>"Have she indeed, poor thing?" responded the woman, in an accent of compassion.</p>
			<p> "I heard so, as I come along, and that's the reason I'm going to her. Our good Sir
				Matthew, who to be sure is the kindest-hearted <pb n="37"/> man in the whole world,
				has taken a fancy to her boy, and he'll be a father to him, I'll be bound to say he
				will; and that's why I think he'd like me to give her a call, just to tell her not
				to fret herself about the workhouse. If she don't like going there, she needn't, I
				dare say, with such a good friend as she's got." </p>
			<p>The woman stared at him with an air of such genuine astonishment, that the
				superintendent felt disconcerted, and turning abruptly away, continued his progress
				down the lane.</p>
			<p>By the time he had reached No. 12, however, he had begun to doubt whether his sudden
				appearance at the bedside of the widow Armstrong might not produce an effect
				unfavourable to the object he had in view.</p>
			<p>"As sure as steam's steam," thought he, "she'll be more inclined to fancy that I am
				come scolding about the boys for something, than to take her part, or do her
				pleasure; so I'll just say a civil word to the Sykeses, and then stroll away on,
				till such time as the parish officers have been after her. I'll engage for it, that
				Sam Butchel won't let no grass grow under his feet after what I said to him; and if
				I turn in when he's there, as if to see what was going on, it would certainly be
				more natural-like, and believable."</p>
			<p>In accordance with this improved <hi>projet de charité</hi> , Mr. Joseph Parsons
				walked on; but he had not proceeded far ere, on turning his head round to
				reconnoitre, he perceived, not the tall and burly Sam Butchel, the overseer of the
				parish, but the lean and lathy person of little Michael, advancing with an eager and
				rapid step towards his mother's dwelling.</p>
			<p>"Soh!" ejaculated the sagacious Parsons, "here comes the charity job! It would be
				worth a week's wages to hear him tell his own story."</p>
			<p>Mr. Joseph Parsons had a Napoleon-like promptitude of action, which the unlearned
				operatives described by calling him "a word-and-a-blow man," but which in reality
				often deserved the higher epithet above bestowed.</p>
			<p>Scarcely had the thought of overhearing little Michael's tale suggested itself, ere a
				sidelong movement ensconced him for a moment behind a favouring pig-sty, from
				whence, unseen, he watched the boy enter the door of No. 12.</p>
			<p>Again Napoleon-like, he remembered all he had heard from her neighbour, concerning
				the position of the widow's dwelling-place; and rightly judging that Sykes's
				back-kitchen must, in some way or other, be in a condition to favour the emission of
				sound, he troubled not the household by making his approaches through the principal
				entrance, but striding over the inefficient fence of the tiny cabbage-plot behind,
				obtained a station as favourable to his purpose, as he could possibly desire. This
				was a nook between a protuberance intended for an oven, and the window close beside
				the widow Armstrong's bed, from whence prophetic fate, favouring the yet latent
				purpose of the manager, had caused three panes to be extracted by a volley of
				pebbles, intended for mother Sykes's cat, at least two months before.</p>
			<pb n="38"/>
			<p>To this safe and commodious crouching-place, he made his way just in time to hear the
				widow say, "Understand one word of Edward's story, Mike; so sit down dear boy, and
				tell me all."</p>
			<p>"Why mother, 'tis like a story-book — and it's very fine to be sure — but yet — " And
				the boy stopped short.</p>
			<p>"But yet you don't like it, Mike?" rejoined his mother. "That's what you was going to
				say. Tell the truth, my child, and don't go to keep nothing from me."</p>
			<p>"That was it," said Mike.</p>
			<p>"Ungrateful viper!" muttered the confidential superintendent between his closed
				teeth.</p>
			<p>"Poor fellow! poor dear Michael!" exclaimed the woman, soothingly. "It was hard to go
				to sleep without kissing mother, wasn't it?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, I didn't like that — nor I didn't like being without Teddy neither — and I
				didn't like the grumpy old lady as comed into the kitchen, and abused me; nor the
				gentlemen servants either, except the gardener, and he took hold of my hand, and led
				me along kind enough — and I like Molly too, that's she as give me my supper and my
				bed, and my breakfast this morning, mother. Oh, mother! how I did long to bring away
				some of the milk and bread and butter home with me!"</p>
			<p>"Never think of such a thing, for your life, boy!" exclaimed the mother eagerly. "It
				would be thieving, nothing else, Michael — nothing more nor less than thieving —
				never mention that again to me, dear, that's a darling."</p>
			<p>"I won't, mother; but I know I shall think of it every time I see them big pounds of
				butter, and jugs of milk, and minds how careful you be over your little scrimped bit
				in the broken saucer, and how you drinks your drop of tea without ever having any
				milk at all."</p>
			<p>"Never you mind that, darling. But what are they going to do with you, Mike? And what
				for do they want to have you up at the great house? 'Tis a mystery to me, and
				thankful as we ought to be for any help, I can't say but I should be easier in my
				mind, if I understood something about it."</p>
			<p>"Impertinent hag!" growled the surly Parsons from his lair. "Does she think they are
				going to trap him like a rabbit, for the sake of his skin?"</p>
			<p>"But, mother, I don't understand any thing about it myself," said Michael, rather
				dolefully.</p>
			<p>To this avowal, no reply was made for some minutes; upon which the superintendent
				grew impatient, and stretching forward his neck a little, contrived athwart the
				sheltering branches of an elder-bush, to peep through the broken window.</p>
			<p> To the agent of Sir Matthew Dowling's benevolence the sight that presented itself
				was really revolting; though there may be others who would have been affected
				differently by it. Michael had flung himself across the bed; his arms were thrown
				round his mother, who was sitting upright with some piece of needlework in her
				hands, <pb n="39"/> and his dark curls set off in strong contrast the extreme
				paleness of the face that looked down upon him. The widow Armstrong was still rather
				a young woman, and would still have been a very lovely one, had not sickness and
				poor living sharpened the delicate features, and destroyed the oval outline that
				nature had made perfect. Yet she had quite enough of beauty left to detain the eye;
				and such a history of patient suffering might be read in every line of her speaking
				countenance, that few ever looked upon her harshly. Spite of her extreme poverty
				too, she was clean — her cap was clean, the bedclothes were clean, and the pale
				hands too, looked so very white, that if Mr. Parsons from his hiding-place had
				ventured to speak any opinion concerning her, he would certainly have given
				utterance to a strong expression of indignation, at the abominable air of delicacy
				which her appearance displayed. </p>
			<p>She looked as if she were struggling with some painful feeling, but did not weep,
				though her boy did, heartily.</p>
			<p>For a little while she suffered his tears to flow without interruption or reproof,
				and then she kissed him once, twice, thrice.</p>
			<p>"There now, Michael," she said, looking at him fondly; "have you not played baby long
				enough? Stand up, darling, and listen to me. You don't seem over-glad, Mike, of this
				great change, and if you did, perhaps I might have been over-sorry; but sorrow would
				be sin for either of us, when God has sent us help. 'Tis you that be the heartiest
				Mike, and 'tis you that want food the most, growing at the rate you do, and
				heart-sore have I been at meal-times to see you so stinted. So never let us trouble
				ourselves any more about the reasons for your getting so into favour, but just thank
				God, and be contented."</p>
			<p>"But mother! How will you get on without me?" replied Michael, shaking his head; "I
				am sure that Teddy can't make your bed as I do — he hasn't the strength in his arms.
				And who's to fetch water? 'Deed and 'deed mother, you'd better thank Sir Matthew,
				and say no, unless he'll just please to let Teddy go instead."</p>
			<p>"That won't do my dear child, in any way. 'Tis I must watch poor Edward. Little as I
				can do for him, I don't think he'd like to part from me, as long as God is pleased
				to let me stay."</p>
			<p>"That's true mother — that's very true! Teddy would break his heart. No, no, 'tisn't
				he shall be parted from you; I'll show him how to make the bed, if I can't come over
				myself; but perhaps they'll let me, mother?"</p>
			<p>"What's the business that you'll have to do, Michael?" inquired the widow.</p>
			<p>"I haven't been told of any business yet," replied the boy.</p>
			<p>"But you don't expect that you're going to be kept for nothing, dear?" said the
				mother, smiling.</p>
			<p>"'Tisn't for my work, mother; 'tis for the cow," replied Michael, gravely.</p>
			<p> "The cow, child? What is it you and Teddy have got into your heads about a cow? A
				poor starved beast, he says it was, that <pb n="40"/> wouldn't have frightened a
				mouse, and you made it turn round, Mike — that's all I can make out. But he must be
				mistaken surely. What was it you did about the cow, darling?" </p>
			<p>At this question, the boy burst into a hearty fit of laughter, which to say truth,
				offended the listening ears of Mr. Joseph Parsons, still more than his weeping had
				done.</p>
			<p>"I'll do his business for him, he may depend upon it," thought he. "If master must
				have a charity job, he must; but it don't follow that the cretur shan't be made to
				know himself just as well as if he was in the factory. I'll be your overlooker yet,
				master Mike."</p>
			<p>Just as this prophetic sketching of the future had made itself distinctly visible to
				his mind's eye, the bodily senses of the agent announced to him that the tranquil
				tête-à-tête within the widow's chamber was disturbed by the entrance of persons,
				whose voice and step announced that they were men. Mr. Parsons was at no loss to
				guess their errand. "Here they come!" muttered he. "Now we'll see how Master Butchel
				manages his job.</p>
			<p>"We be commed to see," said a gruff voice within the widow's chamber, "whether or no
				you be commed to your senses, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
			<p>"Sir?" said the trembling woman in return.</p>
			<p>"You knows well enough what I means, without my going into it again; you knows well
				enough as I comes to talk to ye about the house again. We've had Larkins the baker,
				coming to inquire if there's parish pay to look to, for your bill, Mrs. Armstrong —
				and I have told him, NO, not a farthing, not the quarter of a farthing, unless
				you'll come into the house. The parish have gone on allowing you two shilling a
				week, week after week, God knows how long — 'tis a perfect shame and imposition, and
				the board says they won't do it no longer. You and the boys too may come in if you
				will, that's one thing; but living here, cramming 'em with as much wheaten bread as
				they'll eat without paying for it, is another, and it's what no honest parish don't
				tolerate. I'll be bound to say now, as you have brought up the scamps without their
				ever knowing the taste of gruel? Tell the truth, did you ever take the trouble to
				make a drop of gruel for 'em?"</p>
			<p>"As long as I had my legs to stand upon, sir, I never minded trouble; and, when my
				husband was living, we did a deal better, and I have done cooking for 'em then, such
				as a few potatoes and a cabbage, may be, with a scrap of bacon on a Sunday; but,
				from the hour he died, we have never had a pot upon the fire."</p>
			<p>"That's what 'tis to be so obstinate. If you'd come into the house you'd see the pot
				upon the fire all day long, a'most."</p>
			<p>"But the children would be in one room, after they came from the factory, and I
				should be in another," pleaded the widow, "and I've got a few of the decent things
				as I married with, when I came from service, and it would be a grief to me to see
				'em all sold."</p>
			<p> "If the parish don't sell 'em, Larkins the baker will, you may take my word for
				that, Mrs. Armstrong," replied the overseer. "However, 'tis your business, not mine.
				Here's a decent, respectable <pb n="41"/> man, as is ready to take all you've got at
				a valiation, fair and honourable, but that's just as you please. I only called, as
				in duty bound, to tell ye that the parish don't mean to continy no such extravagance
				as paying you two shilling a week, no longer." </p>
			<p>"God help me!" answered the widow gently. "If 'tis his will that so it should be, it
				would be a sin for me to complain."</p>
			<p>"That's vastly fine, beant it?" said the brutal Butchel, "and now let's hear what
				you'll be after saying to Master Larkins, for here he comes, as sure as eggs be
				eggs."</p>
			<p>An abrupt, and most peremptory demand, for three pounds two shillings and seven
				pence, was here made, by a sour-looking little man, who entered the small room
				without ceremony, making a group of intruders round the widows bed, equally unwonted
				and unwelcome. Her over-taxed courage seemed to fail, for it was with something like
				a sob that she replied to his demand by saying, "I shall have twelve shillings to
				take for needlework, when this is done, and you shall have it every farthing sir, if
				you'll be so merciful."</p>
			<p>"And who's to pay your rent, Missis Armstrong? if I may be so bold," said Mr.
				Butchel.</p>
			<p>The widow had not a word to say for herself, and, covering her face with her hands,
				wept bitterly.</p>
			<p>"Now's my time!" said Parsons to himself, as he stealthily crept from his
				hiding-place. "Now for Sir Matthew's benevolence." And, in a minute afterwards, his
				tall, gaunt figure, and hard countenance, were added to the company. The noise he
				made in entering, caused the widow to uncover her eyes, and it was with an emotion
				little short of terror that she recognised the tyrant, at whose name her children's
				cheeks grew pale. Instinctively she stretched out her hand, and took hold of that of
				Michael, who was still seated on the side of the bed. But the boy shook it off, as
				if his mother's love was a secret treasure that the overlooker must not see, and,
				suddenly standing up, he remained, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his hands
				hanging by his sides, as if petrified.</p>
			<p>"Hollo! — why what's the matter now? Is all the parish come to wish joy to this good
				woman here?" said the overlooker, with as jocund an air as he could persuade his
				iron features to assume.</p>
			<p>"Wish her joy?" responded the well-tutored parish-officer, "and for what, Mr.
				Parsons, if you please? For having an honest tradesman come upon her with the gripe
				of the law, in hopes to get what's his own? She's got into trouble, I promise you,
				and I don't very well see how she's to get out of it."</p>
			<p>"You don't say so?" said the confidential agent. "What! is that you, Mr. Larkins,
				coming to take the law of a poor body this way? I didn't think you was so
				hard-hearted."</p>
			<p> "I don't deserve that character, sir," replied the baker sharply; for though desired
				to call and enforce his claim by the parish overseer, Mr. Larkins knew not a word
				about Sir Matthew's scheme of benevolence; "and the proof that my heart isn't harder
				than other people's" he continued, "is, that I gave the widow here <pb n="42"/>
				credit for what has been, excepting a few ounces of tea, her whole and sole living
				for months past." </p>
			<p>"And very kind of ye too," observed the conciliating superintendent.</p>
			<p>"I should like to know, then, what became of all the money the two boys got, besides
				her own needlework, and, of late, two shilling a week from the parish, beside?"
				observed Mr. Butchel.</p>
			<p>"Why, that is rather puzzling, I must say," replied Mr. Parsons, "but no matter for
				that, no matter for that, just now. This family have got a kind friend, I promise
				you."</p>
			<p>"Yes, but it does matter," returned Larkins. "It can't be right, no how, for me to be
				out of three pounds two shillings and seven pence, and she with such lots of
				money."</p>
			<p>"Indeed, indeed, sir!" said the widow, once more looking up at him, "I have done my
				very best, paying a little and a little at a time, as you know I never stopped
				doing, only for two weeks that my biggest — that is my oldest boy, was making up
				time that was lost, when he was home sick, and so got no wages. But the seven
				shillings a week that they get between 'em, and my uncertain bit of needle-work,
				gentlemen, can't stand for food, and clothes, and rent' — and a little soap to keep
				us decent, and a bit of firing to boil a drop of water — it can't do all that,
				gentlemen, without getting behindhand, when any making up time comes in the
				factory."</p>
			<p>"Well then, that's just the reason why you must come into the house," replied
				Butchel; "and, at any rate, you may depend upon getting no more money out of
				it."</p>
			<p>Upon hearing these words, "the decent, respectable man," who was willing to take the
				widow's goods, at a "valiation fair and honourable," began examining the condition
				of a chair that stood near him; an operation which the widow eyed with the most
				piteous look imaginable.</p>
			<p>"Come into the house, I tell you, without more ado," resumed Butchel. "And what, in
				God's name, d'ye think we want you in for but your own good? D'ye think the parish
				have a fancy for maintaining crippled women and children, by way of a pleasure? 'Tis
				ruination any way; but when you're in, we know the worst of it at once, and that's
				something. The boys' wages will go a bit to help, and at any rate there'll be no two
				shillings to pay, which is what the overseers hates above all things; and what they
				won't continy to do. So now I have said my say."</p>
			<p>And here Mr. Butchel began to move his heavy person towards the door.</p>
			<p>"Stop a minute, Mr. Butchel, if you please sir," ejaculated Sir Matthew's
				superintendent. "I should be sorry to let you go back to your employers under any
				delusion or mistake whatever, and the fact is, that this good woman, the widow
				Armstrong, is no more likely to go into the workhouse than you are yourself, Mr.
				Butchel; begging your pardon for naming such a thing."</p>
			<pb n="43"/>
			<p>"Then I suppose as it's yourself as means to keep her out of it, Mr. Parsons?"
				replied the parish officer jocosely.</p>
			<p>"Not exactly me, myself," replied the other in the same tone, "but it's one as much
				more able as he is willing. It is Sir Matthew Dowling as intends to befriend her,
				and that not only on account of the general charitableness of his temper, which all
				who know him really well are quite aware is very great, but because that little boy
				as stands there, and who is one of our factory children, saved a friend of Lady
				Dowling's, last night, from something she looked upon to be a considerable
				danger."</p>
			<p>"And does Sir Matthew mean to see me paid?" demanded the baker.</p>
			<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Larkin, that's more than what I've got authority to say," replied
				Parsons; "but, howsomever, I don't think that you had best go on, just at this
				particular minute, to persecute about it, seeing that in course Sir Matthew won't
				take it civil, when he's being such a friend himself to the widow."</p>
			<p>"I don't want to do nothing uncivil to nobody," replied the baker, "but I don't quite
				understand this business. It is something new, isn't it, Sir Matthew setting up for
				a soft-hearted gentleman, among the factory folks?"</p>
			<p>"New to you, may be, Mr. Larkin, but not to me," replied the trustworthy agent.
				"There isn't another to be found, look which way you will, that can be compared with
				Sir Matthew Dowling, for real, true, benevolent, charitableness, when he finds
				proper objects for it."</p>
			<p>The baker stared; the man of old chairs and tables scratched his puzzled head; the
				intelligent Mr. Butchel looked at the speaker with a knowing wink; the widow fixed
				her eyes upon her patchwork quilt; and little Michael in astonishment, which
				conquered terror, raised his eyes to the superintendent's face, while that worthy
				advocate of a master's virtues stood firmly, striking his stout cane upon the
				ground, with the air of a man ready to do battle with all the world in support of
				what he has asserted.</p>
			<p>"Well then, at any rate my business is done and ended," said Mr. Butchel moving off,
				"and I wish you joy Mussiss Armstrong of your unaccountable good fortune."</p>
			<p>"Come along, Jim!" said the baker to the respectable dealer in seized goods, "there's
				nothing to be done to-day, that's clear. But I hope you'll remember the twelve
				shillings as you've promised me, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
			<p>"I will indeed, sir!" answered the widow earnestly; and, on receiving this assurance,
				Mr. Larkin took his departure with his professional friend, leaving Mr. Joseph
				Parsons, the widow Armstrong, and her son Michael to carry on whatever conversation
				they might wish for, without interruption.</p>
			<p> "Well now, if I ain't glad they're gone, them fellows," said the superintendent
				shutting the door after them. "You are a favoured woman, Mrs. Armstrong, to get rid
				of 'em as you have <pb n="44"/> done, and I don't and won't, question that you are
				thankful to those to whom thanks are due." </p>
			<p>"I always wish to be so, sir," said the widow.</p>
			<p>"Well, there's no hardship in that I suppose. But about this son of yours, this young
				Master Michael, you must see to his doing his duty to his benefactor. If he was to
				prove ungrateful, Mrs. Armstrong, it is but fair to tell you that I wouldn't
				undertake to answer for the consequences."</p>
			<p>"God forbid he ever should be ungrateful to any as was kind to him!" replied the poor
				woman; "but indeed, sir, I don't think it is in his heart to be so. Since the day he
				was born, God bless him, I have had little besides love to give him, and indeed,
				sir, I think the child would die for me."</p>
			<p>Michael slily stole his little hand sideways under the bedclothes, where it was soon
				clasped in that of his mother, but his eyes were again firmly rivetted upon the
				ground.</p>
			<p>"Ay, ay, that's all very well; but it has nothing to do in any way with his duty and
				obligations to Sir Matthew. What I want to know is, whether he is ready and willing
				to do that which Sir Matthew will require of him — that's the main question, you
				see, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
			<p>"And what will that be, sir?" said the widow, while Michael's eyes were again raised
				for a moment to the face of his taskmaster.</p>
			<p>"He is to be made a gentleman of — that's to be the first work put upon him." The
				poor woman smiled; but little Michael shook his head. The superintendent appeared to
				pay no attention to either; but again striking his cane magisterially upon the
				ground, he added, "Let him make up his mind to do all that he's bid, and come back
				to Dowling Lodge with as little delay as possible."</p>
			<p>With these words, and without deigning to bestow any species of parting salutation
				upon those to whom they were addressed, Mr. Parsons left the room.</p>
		</div><div type="chapter">
			<head> CHAPTER V. </head>
			<p>A SEPARATION OF LOVING HEARTS — A SPECIMEN OF FINISHED COMPOSITION — CONDESCENSION
				AND GENEROSITY — SIR MATTHEW CLOTHES LITTLE MICHAEL WITH HIS OWN HANDS.</p>
			<p>
				While the superintendent, in his serpentine course homeward,
				scattered the tidings of his master's munificence towards the factory-boy, Michael
				Armstrong and his mother indulged themselves in a few parting words and very tender
				caresses; the mother continuing to repeat at intervals, "Be sure, darling, to be a
				good boy, and do what you're bid," while the son reiterated his entreaties that she
					<pb n="45"/> and Teddy would take care one of t'other, and have him back again,
				spite of every thing, if they found that they could not do so well without him. </p>
			<p>But even while this went on, Michael was improving his toilet by putting on the more
				carefully patched garments, which had hitherto been kept sacred for Sundays. When
				this operation was completed, and his hair, face, and hands made as clean as the
				joint efforts of himself and his mother could contrive to make them, the little boy
				turned to leave the miserable shed that had been his home, with a reluctant step and
				heavy heart, retracing the short distance between his mother's bed and the door,
				once and again to take another kiss, and to repeat, with increased earnestness, the
				questions, "Isn't there nothing more I can do for you, mother, before I go away? —
				and will you be sure to tell Teddy to stop for me, morning and night, at the gate in
				the lane, where it all happened? — will you mother?"</p>
			<p>But at length the lingering separation was completed, and Michael set off upon his
				return to Dowling Lodge. In the mean time, Sir Matthew himself had not been idle;
				but, retiring to his study, he composed a paragraph for the county newspaper, which,
				after considerable study and repeated corrections, was at length completed, and
				despatched by the post, in a feigned hand, the wax being stamped with the handle of
				the seal instead of his arms, and the postage paid.</p>
			<p>The paragraph ran thus:</p>
		</div><div type="chapter">
			<head>"ENGLISH BENEVOLENCE.</head>
			<p>"There is, perhaps, no class of men so cruelly misrepresented as the manufacturers of
				Great Britain; surrounded on all sides by a population of labourers, crowded
				together exactly in proportion to the quantity of work the neighbouring factories
				are able to furnish — they are continually reproached both with giving to many hours
				of employment to their poor neighbours on the one hand, and with the poverty which
				is the inevitable lot of operatives with large families on the other.</p>
			<p> "That all manufacturers, however, are not the cruel mercenary tyrants they are so
				often, and so unjustly described to be, was shown within the last few days by an
				incident which occurred near the town of Ashleigh, not a hundred miles from D — I —
				g L — d — e. The owner of that splendid mansion, while escorting the amiable Lady —
				round his grounds, had occasion to remark some symptoms of a very noble disposition
				in one of the children belonging to a neighbouring factory on his estate. On making
				inquiries, he discovered him to be the son of a poor widow, whose failing health
				made her, and her orphan children peculiarly eligible as objects of charity. This
				fact having been satisfactorily ascertained, Sir M — th — w D — l — g gave way to
				the warm impulses of his generous heart, and adopting the little orphan among his
				own children, at once gratified the gentle feelings of his amiable nature, and set
				them an example which it is impossible they should ever forget. It is more easy for
				the recorder of this charming anecdote <pb n="46"/> to relate thus the principal
				circumstances of it, than to enter into any detail of the numberless delicate traits
				of character exhibited by Sir M. D — l — g in the course of the transaction. Those
				who know him thoroughly, will, however, be at no loss how to supply these; and those
				who do not, would scarcely understand the description, were it given with all the
				detail possible." </p>
			<p>The value and the accuracy of the statements contained in this announcement, belonged
				wholly to the author of it; the phraseology to a private MS. digest of newspaper
				eloquence, the result of many years of steady research, during which no morsel of
				fine writing that might assist in such occasional addresses to the public as the
				present, had been ever suffered to flow down the stream of time, and perish, without
				having been first carefully noted in the knight's repertory of fine periods.</p>
			<p>Having concluded this business, Sir Matthew Dowling rang his bell. As it was only the
				study-bell, it was answered, as usual, by one of the housemaids.</p>
			<p>"Where is the little boy, my dear, that I sent into the servants' hall last night?"
				inquired Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p>"Upon my word, Sir Matthew, I can't tell," she replied; adding, in that tone of
				familiar confidence which her master's condescension encouraged, "but if you sent
				him into the hall, Sir Matthew, he never got there, nor never will, you may take my
				word for that, as long as Madam Thompson reigns."</p>
			<p>The housemaid was not a beauty — none such, as was before stated, ever made part of
				Lady Dowling's household; but she was a wit, and Sir Matthew was to clever himself
				not to feel the value of cleverness in others; he, therefore, raised his eyebrows in
				a comic grimace, very good-humouredly chucked the maid under her ugly chin, and
				instead of putting himself in a rage, as might have happened under other
				circumstances, he only said, "And how was that my dear? Come, tell me all about it —
				I like your stories, Peggy, they are always so funny."</p>
			<p>"Whose stories wouldn't he funny, Sir Matthew, if they told of the airs and graces of
				Mother Thompson!" replied the jively damsel; "she's for all the world like an old
				owl, as sits winking his eyes and trying to look wise."</p>
			<p>"But she's a prime favourite with my lady, Peggy, and into the bargain, knows a thing
				or two about soups and hashes; so we must be very respectful, my dear, in talking of
				her — but as to her daring to say, that the boy I ordered into the hall was to be
				turned out of it, that's rather more than possible, I think."</p>
			<p>"That's because you don't know Mrs. Thompson, Sir Matthew. I only wish you had heard
				and seen 'em last night, she, and the butler, and Mrs. Fine Airs, my lady's maid,
				and Mr. Fine Airs, my lady's footman! If it was not enough to make one sick, I wish
				I may never see you again, Sir Matthew."</p>
			<p> "They are a confounded impertinent set of rubbish," replied Sir Matthew; but still
				without losing his good humour. "However, <pb n="47"/> all people of fashion, that
				is, rich people, Peggy, always do have a confounded impertinent set of servants
				about 'em. That's one of the great differences between high people and low." </p>
			<p>"To be sure you must know best, Sir Matthew," replied the saucy grisette, but with a
				look and accent somewhat ironical. "I don't mean to doubt that in the least, I'm
				sure; but in the places I've lived at — Lord Wilmot's, Lord Crampton's, and such
				like, I never <hi>did</hi> hear of my lord's commands being treated in that fashion.
				They might have their jokes in the hall, and the housekeeper's room too, no doubt of
				it, and impudent enough if you like it; but for downright flat disobedience, I never
				did hear of such a thing."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew on hearing this, became rather white about the lips, and red about the
				forehead; but Peggy knew the rising storm was not at all likely to fall on her, so
				nothing daunted, she went on.</p>
			<p>"I don't think I should have taken much notice about it, Sir Matthew, if it hadn't
				been for not liking to see you treated with disrespect; for I'm not over and above
				partial to beggar children myself; but that sort of natural dislike was nothing in
				comparison to my feelings about you, sir: and if I had been placed in power, instead
				of having none, your will would have been obeyed, if every servant in the house had
				flowed at me for it."</p>
			<p>"You're an excellent girl, Peggy," replied the knight, approaching her very
				condescendingly. "You know well enough that you are a favourite, and I know well
				enough, my dear, that you deserve to be so; and I tell you what, Peggy, I'll take
				care to let those animals, my servants, know that I am master here, as well as in
				the factory — and that my word's law!"</p>
			<p>"And so it ought to be, Sir Matthew," replied the obedient domestic. "I hope I know
				my duty too well to dispute my master's will in any thing;" and as she spoke she
				very meekly yielded herself to receive the condescending salute, with which Sir
				Matthew was pleased to reward her excellent sentiments.</p>
			<p>"You are an excellent good girl, Peggy!" he resumed after this little interruption;
				"and don't fear but I shall find means to reward you. But you must give me your
				help, my dear, to confound the impertinence of these fellow-servants of yours; if I
				don't make 'em wait upon that beggar's brat as if he was their lord and master,
				never trust me with a kiss more. Where is the little factory vermin, Peggy?"</p>
			<p>"I ain't able to answer you, Sir Matthew; all I know is, that Mrs. Thompson marched
				us all out of the kitchen where she sat in judgment on him, last night, and there he
				was left with the kitchen-maid and the fat cook; but what's come of him since, I am
				no ways able to say."</p>
			<p>On hearing this, Sir Matthew raised his hand towards the bell, but suddenly
				recollecting himself, he smiled and said, "No, no, that won't do, Peggy, will it?
				Go, my dear, and ask where the boy is, and then come back and tell me."</p>
			<p> The damsel, in return, furtively smiled too, in acquiescence and <pb n="48"/>
				approval of his discretion; and upon leaving his study for the purpose of
				prosecuting her inquiries among the servants, she encountered the object of them, as
				he entered the back-door, on his return from visiting his mother's cottage. </p>
			<p>"Soh! here you are then? Well, you must come along this minute to Sir Matthew," said
				she, addressing him somewhat gruffly, and not too well pleased, perhaps, at this
				interruption to the confidential conversation with her master, which it had been her
				purpose to renew. But to the ears of Michael, the name of Sir Matthew was sufficient
				to render all other words indifferent; and conscious only, that into his dreaded
				presence he must go if commanded to do so, he followed the girl with a beating
				heart, and in a few minutes stood pale, and almost breathless, before the awful
				countenance of the great man.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew gazed at him for a moment with a sort of sneer, which, if interpreted
				skilfully, would have been found to address itself inwardly. Sir Matthew could not
				choose but sneer at the whimsical arrangements of accidents, which had converted him
				into a Mr. Allworthy. The sneer, however, as far as it concerned himself, had no
				mixture of contempt in it. "Had another done this thing," thought he, "should I not
				have called him fool? and is it not ninety-nine chances to a hundred, that thereby I
				should have described him truly? May the same be said of me? No! By the living God,
				it may not! How now, little boy? you have made yourself smart, I see — vastly fine,
				indeed! An inch of clean dowlas, a piece of span-new green baize for a patch, a pair
				of bony legs without stockings, and magnificent shoes — I did not say a pair, Peggy
				— but very magnificent shoes; one I suppose won in battle from a giant, and the
				other from a dwarf . Fine as a prince! isn't he, Peggy?"</p>
			<p>As he thus jeered the little fellow, his eye wandered with malignant jocularity over
				his person, which was, in truth, the very model of make-shift poverty; while the
				child, as if he felt his eye palpably crawl like a reptile over him, shuddered he
				knew not why.</p>
			<p>Then, changing his tone so suddenly, as to make even the confiding Peggy start, he
				continued, "You horrid lump of rags stand back — stand back! back! back! behind that
				high chair — d'ye hear? Stand close and stand still — if he does not make me as sick
				as a dog, Peggy, let me never smell musk more!"</p>
			<p>"He does smell horrid bad to be sure, Sir Matthew!" replied the girl. "Hadn't I
				better take him back to Molly the kitchen-maid, and make her scour him?"</p>
			<p>"No, hang him — that won't take it out of him — I know 'em all. No, Peggy, let the
				scouring alone, and just go up stairs to the nursery-maids, and tell them to send me
				down a good handsome suit of clothes, complete, of Master Duodecimus's — he is the
				nearest in size to this scaramouch; and I will dress him, Peggy, as if he were the
				son of a duke. It will be fun, capital fun, and will it not be generous, Peggy?"</p>
			<p> "Generous, Sir Matthew? It will be past all belief! What? <pb n="49"/> Him to be
				dressed up in the clothes of Master Duodecimus? oh, my! Sir Matthew, you must
				sure-ly be joking." </p>
			<p>"I'm as serious as an undertaker, girl. Get along with you, and do what I bid you —
				the longer you're about it, mind, the longer I shall have to sit in the same room
				with the ragamuflin in his own full dress — so make haste, if you please."</p>
			<p>This was said in a manner to remove all doubts as to the munificent knight's being in
				earnest; and the active Peggy went and returned with as little delay as was
				consistent with the necessity she felt herself under, of entering into some short
				explanation with the nursery ladies; one and all of whom seemed much inclined, on
				the first opening of her mission, to treat the whole business as a hoax. When at
				length, however, she had succeeded in making it apparent that Sir Matthew was
				waiting for the suit of clothes in a most monstrous outrageous passion of a hurry,
				the messenger's arms were speedily loaded in exact conformity to the orders she had
				brought, and she returned to the knight's study with all that was needful to convert
				the rude exterior of little Michael into the nearest resemblance that nature would
				permit, to the elegant and accomplished Master Duodecimus.</p>
			<p>Considering the loathing and disgust manifested by Sir Matthew towards the person and
				the poverty of his <hi>protegé</hi> , it was extraordinary to see the amusement he
				seemed to derive from dressing him up. Though the alert and obedient Peggy stood
				close by to do his pleasure, it was his own large hands that thrust the little limbs
				of Michael into the clothing he chose they should wear, and it was amidst shouts of
				laughter from both, that the ludicrous metamorphosis was completed.</p>
			<p>But somehow or other when they had finished their masquerading work, the result was
				not altogether what Sir Matthew anticipated. The clothes were very handsome,
				well-made clothes, and as poor Michael, notwithstanding his leanness, was a very
				handsome, wellmade boy, the incongruity between them seemed to vanish in the most
				unaccountable manner, as the operation drew towards a conclusion.</p>
			<p>Peggy, however, was not such a fool as not to understand what was expected of her; so
				when the knight, catching up his son's tasselled cap, pressed it down upon the
				little curly head as a lusty packer of worthless goods thrusts down the cover that
				is to enclose them, and then pushed the child towards her with an impulse that
				nearly brought him upon his nose, she very judiciously renewed her noisy laughter,
				exclaiming, "Did any one ever see such a little quiz!"</p>
			<p>"Quiz, girl?" replied Sir Matthew, eyeing him with no very fond expression. "It would
				be well for the scamp if that was the worst you could say of him — I know a thing or
				two Peggy, and that boy will be lucky if he gets drowned. I'll bet a hundred guineas
				that with a few lessons, he would forge any writing you could show him; and before
				he is twenty, he will have taken as many shapes as Turpin. That boy was born with a
				halter round his neck, I want no gipsy to tell me that."</p>
			<pb n="50"/>
			<p>During the whole of the undressing and redressing operations, the boy's cheeks had
				been dyed with blushes, and his eyes so fixedly nailed to the floor, that neither
				Sir Matthew nor his maid had been able to enjoy their embarrassed expression; but as
				this dark prophecy fell on him, he looked up, and it was well for him that his
				munificent patron at the same instant turned his mocking glances towards the
				servant, as he said, "There — gather up his rags, girl, and be sure you wash well
				after it;" for, had he met that speaking young eye, he could hardly have
				misunderstood the scorn that shot from it. As it was, however, he saw nothing but
				the patched garments that were scattered round, and once more sneering as he looked
				at them, he added, "Lead the little blackguard through the servants'-hall, and into
				Mrs. Thompson's parlour — d'ye hear, Peggy, up to her very nose, and tell her that I
				have sent him to pay her a visit, and when she has had enough of the compliment,
				lead him round to Mademoiselle's room, and we'll have a little fun among the
				children."</p>
			<p>By no means displeased with an errand which permitted her to affront with impunity
				the autocrat of all the offices, Peggy gathered together Michael's discarded
				wardrobe and then clutching hold of his hand, led him, <hi>bon gré mal gré</hi> , to
				the presence of the imperious housekeeper.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Willis, my Lady Dowling's own maid, and Mr. Jennings, my Lady Dowling's own man,
				were enjoying with that important functionary a slight morning repast of fruit,
				cakes, and wine, and at the moment Peggy and her charge entered, they were enjoying
				some very excellent jokes together. But, Mr. Jennings no sooner cast his eyes on the
				little factory-boy, than he arose, looking rather abashed at being caught by a
				drawing-room guest of even nine years old, with a glass of claret in one hand, and a
				slice of pineapple in the other.</p>
			<p>Peggy, to whom the conciliatory smiles of this gay gentleman did not descend, enjoyed
				his mystification exceedingly; and relaxing her rough hold of Michael's wrist, she
				led him respectfully towards the table saying, "My master has sent this young
				gentleman to pay you a visit, Mrs. Thompson; perhaps he would like a little fruit.
				There, my dear, that's the housekeeper Sir Matthew told you of, and if you will
				please to go and sit down by her, I dare say she will give you something nice."</p>
			<p>Mr. Jennings immediately placed a chair beside the gracious Mrs. Thompson, who, after
				filling and setting before the young gentleman a plate with whatever she supposed
				would be most agreeable, said in a half whisper to his conductor, "Who is it, Peggy?
				I didn't hear never a carriage."</p>
			<p>Before she could, or at least before she would answer, Michael, who had not accepted
				the chair offered to him, took his cap from his head, and with considerably more
				courage than he had yet shown said, "I am Michael Armstrong, the factory-boy."</p>
			<p>"Who! What?" screamed the housekeeper; "what bold joke is this, Mrs. Peggy Perkins?
				Do you think you have got a patent for your place, that you dare play such tricks as
				this?"</p>
			<pb n="51"/>
			<p>"if I keeps my place, I don't think I shall have to thank you for it, ma'am," replied
				the favoured housemaid, with very little civility. "My master ordered me to bring
				the boy to <hi>pay you a visit;</hi> those was his very words, Mrs. Thompson, and as
				I was bid, so I have done."</p>
			<p>"There's some people as will do every thing and any thing they are bid," observed
				Mrs. Willis, again drawing out her favourite smelling-bottle, while with the other
				hand she extended a wine-glass to Mr. Jennings, for a little Madeira, which she felt
				was absolutely necessary to support her in this very disagreeable emergency.
				"Master, or no master, Sir Matthew Dowling doesn't know how to behave himself — it's
				I says it, and I don't care who repeats it to him."</p>
			<p>Mr. Jennings started at the factory-boy for a full minute very attentively, and then
				gave a long low whistle, at the same time turning his eyes with a look of much
				intelligence full in the face of the housekeeper.</p>
			<p>"He isn't at all like any of 'em, Mrs. Thompson," said he.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Thompson shook her head. "There is nothing at all in that, Mr. Jennings, I'm
				sorry to say. But remember I do desire, and insist, that the subject is never
				alluded to in my presence again. When I lived with his grace, I always made it a
				rule that none of the household should ever discourse in my presence of any thing
				that it was not decent to hear."</p>
			<p>"Well, ma'am," said Peggy; "when you have done looking at him, he is to go into
				Momsell's room for the children to see him."</p>
			<p>The housekeeper, the lady's-maid, and the footman, all simultaneously lifted up their
				hands and eyes to heaven.</p>
			<p>"Please to let me put on my old clothes and go home," said Michael.</p>
			<p>"You little ungrateful wretch!" exclaimed Peggy; "when Sir Matthew dressed you up
				himself with his own hands. What d'ye mean by that, you bad boy?"</p>
			<p>"They'll laugh at me," said Michael, resolutely; "and I don't like it."</p>
			<p>"You don't? Isn't that a good one?" said Mr. Jennings, clapping his hands in ecstasy.
				"Oh, Lord! pray let us have him back again, Mrs. Peggy, that is to say if Sir
				Matthew can bear to part with him. He's the finest fun I've got sight of this many a
				day."</p>
			<p>"You must find fun for yourself, Mr. Jennings, for I shan't be at the trouble of
				bringing you none," replied the self-satisfied Peggy, again seizing the hand of
				Michael, and leading him off.</p>
			<p>"Well, for a broom-maid, I hope she's saucy enough," said Mr. Jennings; but the
				subject of his remark was already beyond hearing, threading her way through the long
				stone passages which conducted to the opposite wing of the mansion, the whole of
				which was appropriated to the younger branches of the Dowling family.</p>

			<p>MICHAEL'S INTRODUCTION TO ALL THE MISS DOWLINGS — SIR MATTHEW FEEDS HIM WITH HIS OWN
				HAND, AND PRESENTS HIM TO ALL HIS MOST FRIENDS.</p>
			<p>
				Having given a sharp rap on the door, Peggy was told to "comeen,"
				by the voice of Mademoiselle Beaujoie; whereupon she threw the door wide open before
				her, and stood with Michael Armstrong in her hand, in the presence of three grown-up
				Miss Dowlings, and three middle-sized Miss Dowlings, two little Miss Dowlings, and
				their French governess.</p>
			<p>The five youngest, all rushed as by one accord towards Michael. "What a pretty little
				boy!" was exclaimed by two or three of them. "Are you come to play with us? Mayn't
				we have a holiday, Ma'mselle?"</p>
			<p>"What an elegant-looking creature!" exclaimed the eldest Miss Dowling, who with her
				two grown-up sisters, had come into the room for the advantage of practising duets
				on a venerable pianoforte totally out of tune, and whose loudest note could by no
				means compete with the shrill accents of the animated group who inhabited the
				apartment. "Did you ever see a prettier boy, Harriet?"</p>
			<p>"Who is he, I wonder?" replied the young lady she addressed.</p>
			<p>"How he blushes!" said the governess, tittering.</p>
			<p>"What's your name, dear?" demanded Miss Martha, the third daughter of the Dowling
				race.</p>
			<p>"Michael Armstrong, ma'am," replied the boy, looking up with an air of surprise, for
				Miss Martha, queer-looking as she was, spoke kindly. And queer-looking as she was,
				Michael met her eye with pleasure, for that too spoke kindly, though it was neihter
				large nor bright.</p>
			<p>Martha Dowling was in truth, about as ugly as it was possible for a girl of seventeen
				to be, who was neither deformed nor marked by the smallpox, — short, fat,
				snub-nosed, red-faced, with a quantity of sandy hair, that, if not red, looked very
				much as if it intended to be so; eyes of a light, very light gray, and without any
				thing whatever in external appearance to recommend her, except a smooth, plump, neck
				and shoulders, with hands and arms to match, which, in truth, were very fair and
				nice-looking, and a set of well-formed, stout white teeth.</p>
			<p> What made the unlucky appearance of this young lady the more remarkable, was the
				contrast it presented to the rest of her family. All the other young people were,
				like both their parents, "more than common tall," for their respective ages, and,
				like most other tall young people, rather thin, so that Lady Dowling was apt to
				indulge herself by declaring that, "though certainly some of her children might be
				considered prettier than the rest, there was not <pb n="53"/> one of the whole set
				(except that poor vulgar Martha), who was not most particular genteel-looking." </p>
			<p>" <hi>Genteel looking</hi> " she certainly was not, nor graceful, nor beautiful in
				any way: and the consequence was, that father, mother, brothers, and sisters, were
				all most heartily ashamed of her. This was a misfortune, and she felt it to be so
				pretty sharply, for poor vulgar Martha was far from being a stupid girl. But, in her
				case, as in a million of others, it might be seen that adversity, though "Like the
				toad, ugly and venomous, Weareth a precious jewel in its head." for of all her race
				she was the only one whose heart was not seared and hardened by the ceaseless
				operation of opulent self-indulgence. She felt that she was rather an object of pity
				than of admiration, of contempt than of envy, of dislike than of love. This is
				severe schooling for a young girl's heart, but if it produce not reckless
				indifference, or callous insensibility, it often purifies, softens, and even
				elevates the character. Such were its effects on Martha Dowling: that coarse-seeming
				exterior contained the only spark of refinement of which the Dowling family could
				boast. Never did a high-born Hidalgo, in Spain's proudest days, inculcate among his
				race the immeasurable importance of pure descent, with more ceaseless or more
				sedulous earnestness, than did Sir Matthew, the omnipotence of wealth among his.
				Every child was taught, as soon as its mind became capable of receiving the
				important truth, that not only was it agreeable to enjoy and cherish all the good
				things which wealth can procure, but that it was their bounden and special duty to
				make it visible before the eyes of all men that they could, and that they did, have
				more money spent upon them, than any other family in the whole country; but Martha
				felt that all this could not apply to her.</p>
			<p>Strange to say, the only tie resembling affection which prevented the total isolation
				of this poor girl among her family, was that which existed between her hard-natured
				father and herself; but it was a sentiment not easy to analyze. In Sir Matthew it
				probably arose at first from his having been told that the little girl was very like
				him; and, on hers, from his being the only person in the house who had ever bestowed
				a caress upon her. In both cases, cause and effect went on increasing. Martha's face
				(saving its expression), was incontrovertibly like her father's; and, for that
				reason, or from the habit it had at first created, her father, though rather ashamed
				to confess it, was certainly very fond of her.</p>
			<p> That, as a child, she should love him in return, was almost inevitable; but that, as
				she advanced in years, she should feel for the being, the most completely formed by
				nature to be hateful to her, an affection the most unchanging and devoted, had
				something of mystery in it less easy to be explained. Yet, so it was. Martha Dowling
				adored her hard-hearted, vicious, unprincipled, illiterate, vulgar father, as
				heartily as if he had been the model of every thing she most admired and approved.
				Nay, it may be, that she loved him <pb n="54"/> better, or, at any rate, more
				strongly still; for it was rather with fanaticism than devotion, or like the pitying
				fondness with which a mother dotes on a deformed child, who sees only that because
				it is less loveable it has more need of love than the rest. </p>
			<p>It was not, however, on the same principle, that Sir Matthew's affection for his ugly
				daughter increased as years rolled on; for he saw, that though as a child she had
				been like him, she was now grown very plain: and, in company, he felt almost as much
				ashamed of her, as Lady Dowling herself. But he could not mistake her love and true
				affection, nor resist the charm of feeling that at least there was one being in
				existence, who would have cherished him, even if he had not been the great man he
				was.</p>
			<p>In private he scrupled not to yield to this feeling, and certainly derived
				considerable pleasure from it; but before witnesses, he always joined in the family
				tone respecting " <hi>poor Martha</hi> ," and scrupled not to push her on one side,
				upon all occasions on which any display of Dowling elegance was contemplated.</p>
			<p>It was this ugly Martha Dowling who now startled little Michael with her voice of
				kindness, and, notwithstanding all her lady mother said about the "horrid vulgarity
				of her manners," poor Martha had a sweet and gentle voice. The child looked up at
				her, and with the weakness that appeared constitutionally peculiar to him, his eyes
				were immediately filled with tears. Yet Michael was not a whimpering boy either;
				many had seen him harshly treated, for he had worked almost from babyhood in the
				cotton-factory, but nobody had ever seen him cry under it. But if his mother, or his
				poor sickly brother, touched his little heart, either with joy or tenderness, he
				would weep and laugh both, with very infantine susceptibility. So it was with him
				now, for when Martha added with a good-humoured smile, "And what brings you here,
				Master Armstrong?" he laughed outright as he replied, "Indeed, ma'am, I ain't Master
				Armstrong, and I don't know a bit what I be here for."</p>
			<p>This speech, though addressed to Martha, being heard by all, the contrast between his
				appearance and his language considerably excited the curiosity of the two eldest
				Miss Dowlings.</p>
			<p>"La! how he talks! I thought he was a gentleman by his jacket, didn't you, Arabella?"
				said Miss Harriet.</p>
			<p>"Yes to be sure I did," replied the eldest sister. "But I am sure he is <hi>not</hi>
				, with that horrid way of speaking, what did you bring him here for Peggy?"
				continued the young lady with an air of authority.</p>
			<p>"Because master bid me, miss," was the satisfactory reply.</p>
			<p>"Well to be sure, that is queer! I suppose he's the son of somebody or other, or papa
				would never have sent him in to us. It is not at all his way to patronise vulgarity.
				Where do you live, young gentleman?"</p>
			<p>Michael looked very much as if he were in danger of laughing again, but he did not,
				and replied very demurely, "in Mr. Sykes's back-kitchen, ma'am, in Hoxley-lane."</p>
			<p> Though the answer was addressed to the inquirer, his eye turned <pb n="55"/> to
				Martha as he uttered it, as if anxious to see how she bore it, but he encountered a
				look that altogether puzzled him; for though it was at least as kind as before,
				there was uneasiness in it, and she looked round her, as if uncomfortably doubtful
				of what would happen next. </p>
			<p>She did not, however, wait long for the result; for Miss Sophia, Miss Louisa, and
				Miss Charlotte, the three middling-sized Miss Dowlings, who had approached very near
				to the little boy, and were even growing so familiar that Miss Charlotte had taken
				hold of one of his dark curls, were severally and suddenly drawn off by the
				respective hands of their two eldest sisters, and the governess.</p>
			<p>"Then he is not a young gentleman after all?" said Miss Sophia.</p>
			<p>"La; how funny!" exclaimed Miss Louisa, "where <hi>did</hi> he get his clothes from?"
				interrogated Miss Harriet.</p>
			<p>"Most likely he stole them," responded Miss Arabella.</p>
			<p>"Why 'tis Duodecimus's jacket!" ejaculated the observing Miss Charlotte.</p>
			<p>"Oh! quelle horreur!" cried the governess driving her pupils all before her to the
				other end of the room.</p>
			<p>At this moment, and before any more active measures could be resorted to for the
				safety of the young ladies, the door of the school-room was again thrown open, and
				the portly person of Sir Matthew appeared at it, accompanied by the globe-like
				figure of Doctor Crockley.</p>
			<p>"Good morning young ladies!" said the proud father, looking round him, and
				immediately entering into the jest that he saw was afloat. "How do you like the
				young beau I have sent you?"</p>
			<p>"Good gracious, papa!" exclaimed the elegant and much admired Miss Arabella, "he is a
				beggar-boy and a thief!"</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew, and his friend Doctor Crockley, both burst into such a shout of laughter
				at this sally, that it was a minute before either of them could speak; but at length
				the knight, turning to the doctor, said,</p>
			<p>"Leave my girls alone, Crockley, for finding out what's what; I don't believe there's
				one of them but what would have found that fellow out, if I had wrapped him up in
				the king's own mantle."</p>
			<p>"They are sharp enough, there is no doubt of that," replied his friend, "but I must
				say you don't perform your charitable acts by halves, Sir Matthew. You have dressed
				up the little scamp so superbly, that nothing but the vulgar dark complexion could
				make one know that he was not one of your own."</p>
			<p>"Why yes, there is some difference in the skins I must say," replied Sir Matthew,
				looking with most parental complacency on the fair skins, flaxen hair, and light
				eyelashes of his race.</p>
			<p> Difference, indeed! 'Tis Africa and Europe. And is it not remarkable Sir Matthew to
				see the look of him? Hasn't he got a sort of slavish, terrified air with it? I tell
				you what, Sir Matthew, I should not be at all surprised to find, when the march of
				philosophy has got a little farther, that the blackamoor look comes along <pb n="56"/> with the condition, and, that the influence of wealth and consequence is as
				quickly shown upon the external appearance of men, women, and children, as a field
				of clover upon the inferior animals. And why not? It is quite natural — perfectly
				conformable to the analogy, that, by accurately tracing cause and effect, may be
				followed through all creation. You have a head, Sir Matthew, for that sort of thing:
				you can understand me, if nobody else can." </p>
			<p>The little doctor knew that this was <hi>one</hi> of the soft points at which his
				wealthy neighbour was assailable. Sir Matthew loved to be assured that his head was
				of a superior fabric.</p>
			<p>"But why, papa, should you send a nasty beggar-boy to us, with Duo's clothes on?"
				inquired the intelligent Louisa. Before he replied to this, the knight exchanged a
				glance with his friend, which seemed to say, "that's the right sort — she's in the
				clover-field."</p>
			<p>"I have taken him in for charity, my dear," replied the knight, with a sort of
				pomposity that seemed of a new pattern. The young ladies had never seen papa look so
				before. Martha, from having found herself rather more frequently the object of Dr.
				Crockley's jokes than she desired, had, on his entering the room, retired to the
				window, but now she came up to her father, and quietly, and as often happened,
				almost unnoticed, kissed his hand.</p>
			<p>For charity!" exclaimed the fair-haired Arabella, moving a step or two farther away
				from the object of this extraordinary caprice. "La Papa! why don't you send him to
				the hospital?"</p>
			<p>Doctor Crockley laughed outrageously. "That girl, Sir Matthew," he said, when he had
				recovered his voice, "that girl is beyond all comparison the most thoroughly-born
				lady that ever I happened to hit upon — and that is saying something, I promise you.
				She hasn't a commonplace vulgar notion in her from top to toe. It is what I call the
				physiology of wealth — it is upon my soul — it is a study, a science. I have not got
				to the end of it, but I am certain I shall make a system out of it — and you'll be
				able to follow me, there's some comfort in that. I declare to God, that if I had not
				found you in the neighbourhood, I should have bolted. I cannot exist without
				occasionally bringing my mind in contact with superior intellect; you find that,
				too, Sir Matthew, I'm sure you do."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew assured him that he did, very much; and then pulling a Belinda lock that
				adorned the olive-coloured throat of Mademoiselle Beaujoie, he asked her if she had
				ever seen a brat, taken in for charity, so nicely dressed as that little
				blackguard."</p>
			<p>"Brawt? ça veut dire petit vaut-rien. No, my honor Sire Matue, nayver! you are
				viddout no reval de most — "</p>
			<p>Whilst the French governess struggled to find a word sufficiently expressive of
				admiration, and if possible, with some little meaning besides, Sir Matthew took the
				liberty of pinching her ear, while he whispered into it, "What, you little rogue?
				what?"</p>
			<p> She gave him a Parisian <hi>æillade</hi> , by no means an unkind one, and turned
				away, while the two smallest Miss Dowlings ran up to her, and, in the jargon in
				which their mamma and papa delighted, <pb n="57"/> demanded "si papa voulait let
				them jouer avec the little beggar-boy?" </p>
			<p>This question, repeated nearly in the same words by Mademoiselle Beaujoie to the
				knight, appeared to cause him some perplexity, and, after reflecting upon it for a
				minute, he turned to consult his philosophical friend.</p>
			<p>"I say Crockley, what do you think of that?" Then lowering his voice, he added, "you
				comprehend the job, doctor, — which will do best to help it? Parlour or kitchen,
				school-room or factory, drawing-room or scullery?</p>
			<p>"All and every of them," replied his friend, in the same low tone, but very
				decisively. "No doubt in nature about that, Sir Matthew; he must be here, there, and
				every where, and the thing will fly like mad."</p>
			<p>"You are always right Crockley, there is nobody like you," replied the grateful
				knight, cordially slapping the round shoulders of his friend, "I twig, I twig, and
				so it shall be, by the Lord Harry."</p>
			<p>"You are as rapid as lightning, Sir Matthew! I remember no instance of a cerebral
				formation so absolutely perfect as yours. Now then, let us visit my lady, shall we?
				I am as dry as brickdust, and it is about lunch-time I take it. Bring the boy with
				you, and introduce him before the servants in style."</p>
			<p>"So I will — that's it — I twig, Crockley. Go, Martha, and see if the luncheon is
				laid."</p>
			<p>The report being favorable to the wishes of the gentleman, the party, consisting of
				the three eldest Miss Dowlings, their papa and the doctor, left the young ladies and
				their governess to dine, while, with little Michael, who was ordered to follow, they
				all repaired to the dinning-room, where a well-covered table awaited them.</p>
			<p>Her ladyship and Mr. Augustus were already there, and both expressed exactly the
				degree of curiosity which the knight desired, as to who the little gentleman might
				be whom they brought with them.</p>
			<p>Miss Dowling; and Miss Harriet Dowling, burst into a loud laugh; Sir Matthew looked
				towards the sideboard, and seeing two servants in attendance there, spoke as
				follows:</p>
			<p>"My dear Lady Dowling, I must bespeak your munificent charity, and universal
				benevolence in favour of this little unhappy boy. His mother is a widow, and — and
				something, I forget exactly what, is very unhappy about her — and this little boy
				behaved remarkably well — " Here Sir Matthew broke off in some degree of
				embrrassment, not wishing particularly to impress upon his lady's mind that it was
				his tender care for the Lady Clarissa, Shrimpton, which had first introduced the
				fortunate factory-boy to his notice. But he passed all that over very skilfully, and
				ended his harangue by saying, "I know perfectly well, my dear lady Dowling, that
				there is not in the whole world so amiable a person as yourself, and therefore I
				entertain not the slightest doubt, that the benevolence which warms my heart on this
				occasion, will communicate itself to yours."</p>
			<pb n="58"/>
			<p>Lady Dowling raised her light eyebrows, and her still lighter eyelashes, into a look
				of the most unmitigated astonishment, and remained thus for a while, contemplating
				the extraordinary spectacle, of one of the handsomest boys she had ever seen,
				dressed in a style of unquestionable fashion, and presented to her as a being so
				deplorably miserable, as to have excited the pity of her husband. The first clear
				and distinct idea that suggested itself was, the necessity of inquiring respecting
				this beautiful child's mother, and of finding out whether she might not happen to be
				beautiful too; the next arose from the sudden recognition of her own son's own
				clothes, and the complexion of the lady became extremely florid."</p>
			<p>"I should like to know where he got those clothes from," she said in accents that by
				no means spoke composure of spirit.</p>
			<p>"My dearest love," replied the most amiable and the most polite of husbands, "that is
				entirely my doing. You have known me long enough, my sweetest, to be aware that I
				never do any thing by halves — I saw that little fellow ragged and wretched, and I
				clothed him!"</p>
			<p>"Well, I must say, I do think — " began her ladyship, when Sir Matthew, seating
				himself at the table, thrust a knife and fork into the very centre of a pigeon-pie,
				and accompanied the act by a sound, something between a slight cough and a grunt,
				which, in language matrimonial, was known to mean, "You had better hold your tongue
				and mind your business." Whereupon, Lady Dowling sat down too, but her fair
				complexion was rather more rosy than was becoming, and it was in no very sweet voice
				that she said to Martha, who ventured to take a chair next her, "Do get a little
				farther, child can't you? — You know I hate to be crushed and crammed up so."</p>
			<p>Here Dr. Crockley, who had already fallen with vehemence upon a cold ham, stopped for
				a moment, and laughed vehemently. "My dear madam, you are of the slight and elegant
				order yourself, and you don't make allowance for poor people who are as fat and
				roundabout as Miss Martha and I — we can't squeeze ourselves into an eggshell, Miss
				Martha, can we?"</p>
			<p>Her slim sisters tittered, and the witty Augustus observed, that "To be sure, Martha
				did look more like a collar of Oxford brawn, than any thing else in creation."</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the meal proceeded, and little Michael, continued to stand half-way
				between the door and the table, as fixedly as if he had taken root there.</p>
			<p>Martha was, in general, very philosophically inclined to let all things round her
				take their course; but she sat exactly opposite to the object of her father's
				benevolence, and there was something in the expression of his eye, as it rested upon
				the dainties before him, that was more than she could bear. "May I give the little
				boy something to eat, papa?" said she addressing her father in a timid voice.</p>
			<p>"How shall we manage about that, Crockley?" whispered Sir Matthew into the ear of the
				doctor who sat close to him.</p>
			<pb n="59"/>
			<p>"Cram him, cram him, Sir Matthew. — You'll find it like oil on the surface of water,
				spreading far and wide," replied his counsellor, whispering in return, "Let the boy
				have to boast of his high feeding, and it will do more good than if you were to
				endow him with lands and houses, and keep him lean."</p>
			<p>"Say you so, my wise man! Faith, then, the matter is easy enough, for I believe
				Dowling Lodge is rather celebrated for its superfluity of good cheer. We'll have him
				gasping with indigestion within a week, see if we don't." Then raising his voice, he
				answered the petition of Martha, by repeating her words, "May you give the little
				boy something to eat?" and then added with a laugh, "By all manner of means, Miss
				Martha; and," taking some halfdemolished fragments off his own plate, "he may boast
				of feeding as well as his master. Here, Master Factory, catch!" And so saying, the
				benevolent owner of Dowlig Lodge skilfully cut the air with half a pigeon, which,
				taking exactly the direction he intended, struck Michael in the middle of his
				forehead. Whatever might be the effect of this liberality of heart and hand out of
				doors, Sir Matthew had every reason to be satisfied with the result within.</p>
			<p>The whole Dowling family, with the exception of stupid Martha, burst into a
				simultaneous shout of delight, while Dr. Crockley clapped his hands, and
				vociferated, "Bravo!" as loud as he could scream.</p>
			<p>Just at this moment, the great bell at the front door, and it was a very great bell,
				resounded along passage and halls with prodigious clamour. This is a sound which
				produces, in those who hear it, emotions varying according to their varying
				temperaments. Genuinely fine, <hi>poco curante</hi> people, if they hear it, heed it
				not. Fussy folks, of whatever rank or station, prepare their looks and their books,
				themselves and their belongings, to receive the threatened visitation
				advantageously; but in a mansion of such professional display as Dowling Lodge, a
				ring at the door-bell is an event of serious importance. In such an establishment,
				the luxuries, or even the comforts of the family, are confessedly of no importance
				at all, when placed in competition with the display of their grandeur; and upon the
				present occasion, the whole family hastened to leave their unfinished repast, in
				order to receive the welcome spectator of their fine clothes and fine furniture in
				the drawing-room.</p>
			<p>"My Lady Dowling, and her two light-coloured elder daughters, Sir Matthew, his eldest
				son, and his learned friend, succeeded in reaching their respective sofas and
				bergères half a minute before the door was thrown open, and Lady Clarissa Shrimpton,
				Miss Brotherton, Miss Mogg, and Mr. Osmond Norval were announced.</p>
			<p> Great, of course, and very zealous was the joy expressed by the Dowling family at
				the sight of their illustrious friend and her <hi>cortège</hi> . Miss Brotherton
				was, indeed of herself, or rather of her purse, a personage pretty sure of being
				well received every where; but <pb n="60"/> even Miss Mogg was (in yankee phrase)
				well shaken, and Mr. Osmond Norval gazed at by the young ladies, as an emanation
				from the rays that encircle the brow of Apollo; while even the exquisite Augustus
				ventured, in compliment to his titled patroness, to shake him too, though he had
				never been introduced to him at Oxford. </p>
			<p>But the feelings of Sir Matthew, at this prompt reappearance of his fair and noble
				friend, were something vastly different from any thing his family could participate
				in, nor did Lady Clarissa mistake them. There was a look that spoke infinitely more
				than any tongue could utter, and a meaning in the silent pressure of the hand,
				confirming the idea, which had often recurred to her during the night, that it would
				soon be necessary to make Sir Matthew understand the exact nature and extent of the
				flattering, but perfectly innocent preference she was conscious of feeling for
				him.</p>
			<p>This first delightful, but somewhat agitating moment over, Lady Clarissa hastened to
				explain the purpose of her visit.</p>
			<p>"You guess why I am come, do you not, Sir Matthew?" she said, pointing to Mr. Osmond
				Norval. "Permit me to present to you, and your highly-educated family, this young
				votary of the muses, who, if my judgment errs not, may fairly claim competition with
				the first poets of the age. Nor should we, of this remote neighbourhood, be
				insensible to the honour of being the first to assist in pluming the yet unfledged
				wing, which shall one day bear him aloft into the empyrean regions of eternal
				fame."</p>
			<p>Nothing could be more touching than the manner in which Mr. Osmond Norval pressed his
				hat between his two hands, and bowed low, low, low, to the noble lady who thus
				announced him. Sir Matthew, with a stride which, for the vigorous distance it
				carried him, might have been compared to that of the knave of hearts, approached the
				young man, and strenuously pressing one of his slender hands in both his own
				capacious fists, attested the value he attached to her ladyship's introduction by
				saying, "Mr. Osmond Norval! — I will not deny, that I do occasionally myself offer
				tribute at the muse' shrine; and that being in some sort a brother of the craft, I
				most unfeignedly rejoice in making the acquaintance of a gentleman so distinguished
				in it as yourself. But that is not the feeling, sir, which principally leads me to
				tell you, that from this time forth, I shall hold you as one of my most esteemed
				friends — you understand me. That lady, sir," pointing to Lady Clarissa, "is a
				person whose lightest word ought to be law in this neighbourhood, — and to me, is
				so. If you publish any works, put Sir Matthew Dowling's name down, sir, for fifty
				copies; should you find yourself at any time in want of a library, pray remember
				that there is one of no very small limits at Dowling Lodge; and your reception, sir,
				in my drawing-room, and at my dinner-table, will ever be such as befits me to bestow
				on one honoured by the patronage of Lady Clarissa Shrimpton."</p>
			<p> Before this speech was quite finished, Lady Dowling becoming rather fidgetty,
				ventured to mutter something about its being far <pb n="61"/> better to sit down to
				talk; but Miss Brotherton was greatly too much amused by what was passing to hear
				her; and for Miss Mogg to sit while her patroness stood, was quiet out of the
				question; so that Lady Dowling, and the too eldest Miss Dowlings, continued to stand
				like three finely-dressed flaxen-headed statues, to the end of it. </p>
			<p>Sir Matthew than led the high-born lady to a chair, while Miss Brotherton perceiving
				that her conversation with the knight was now reduced to a whisper, and that
				consequently there would be no more fun in listening to it, condescended at last to
				answer a few of the amiable inquiries after her health, which were addressed to her
				by Mr. Augustus and his two sisters. Meanwhile, the young Norval, with pensive eye
				intent on nature's beauties, stole his way to the open window, and there having
				twice or thrice passed his fingers through his long locks, which descendedlin
				disordered curls almost to his shoulders, and once and again buttoned and unbuttoned
				the broad shirt-collar which fell back, unrestrained by that most unintellectual
				ligature, a cravat, remained partly, it might be, to let the young ladies look at
				him, and partly to receive the fragrant breeze of summer upon his brow.</p>
			<p>It was now that Dr. Crockley felt he was called upon to do something that might bring
				him into notice, and waddling up to the young poet, he addressed him with an air of
				incipient friendship which seemed to say, "And I too am somebody."</p>
			<p>"You will find this neighbourhood not very prolific, young gentleman, in such gifts
				of intellect as a poet requires in order to be duly appreciated. Nevertheless, I
				will not deny that there is amongst us a knot, a little knot, Mr. Norval, whom, upon
				further acquaintance, you may find not altogether uncongenial. For myself, I may
				venture to say, that I am as warmly devoted to every subject, directly or
				indirectly, connected with the divine, ethereal, immaterial, intellectual part of
				our composite formation, as it is possible for a man to be, and it will give me
				pleasure, sir, to make your acquaintance." As this was spoken with energy, the
				sultry season made itself felt under the exertion, and Dr. Crockley found it
				necessary so far to remember the viler portion of his composite formation, as to
				wipe his face and bald head assiduously.</p>
			<p>The poet bowed, but not as he had bowed to Lady Clarissa.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Lady Dowling, her light-coloured daughters, and Miss Mogg, sat profoundly
				silent upon two chairs and one sofa of the splendid apartment; Miss Brotherton and
				Mr. Augustus continued to talk about nothing, and Sir Matthew and Lady Clarissa
				ceased not to mutter, what none but themselves could hear, upon an ottoman, which
				stood in front of a distant window. If eyebeams could have interrupted a
					<hi>tête-à-tête</hi> , theirs would not have long continued to proceed
				undisturbed; for the mistress of Dowling Lodge did certainly cast not a few anxious
				glances towards the master of it; but it was not for that reason that he at length
				got up and rather hastily left the room.</p>
			<pb n="62"/>
			<p>While all this was passing in the drawing-room, Martha Dowling and Michael Armstrong
				remained alone together in the dining-room.</p>
			<p>The flying pigeon, impelled by the beneficent Sir Matthew, having hit the forehead of
				his highly-favoured <hi>protegé</hi> at the very moment that the larum, announcing
				Lady Clarissa's arrival made itself heard, the greatly amused company left the room
				before it was possible to ascertain what would become of it.</p>
			<p>The child "caught it ere it came to the ground;" but having done so, held it by one
				leg with an air of very comical indecision, till Dr. Crockley, who respectfully
				walked the last out of the room, shut the door behind him.</p>
			<p>The eyes of the factory-boy and the ugly girl then met. "Come to the table, my dear,"
				said Martha; "and if you like that bird, eat it — here is a plate and knife and fork
				for you; but if you like any thing else better, leave it, and tell me what you will
				have."</p>
			<p>Michael opened his magnificent black eyes, and looked earnestly at her. He approached
				the table, laid down the half-dissected pigeon, but said not a word.</p>
			<p>"You would like something else better, would you not?" said Martha, smiling at
				him.</p>
			<p>"I don't know," answered Michael, returning the smile.</p>
			<p>"You don't know? — cannot you tell what you should like?"</p>
			<p>"No ma'am, if you please; I don't know what any of it is."</p>
			<p>"My dear child, it is all very good, I believe, only you know some people like one
				thing, and some another. Little boys generally like something very sweet. Here is
				some cake, what do you say to that?"</p>
			<p>"I know what I should like best," said Michael.</p>
			<p>"Do you? — then you shall have it, if you will tell me what it is."</p>
			<p>"Something good for mother," said the child, blushing violently; "but you must send
				me, and order me to take it to her, or else it will be stealing it."</p>
			<p>"Very well, I will send something to her; but you must eat something yourself first.
				What shall it be, Michael?" This arrangement seemed to put the boy into a state of
				perfect ecstasy; he clapped his hands, raised one foot, and then the other, with
				childish glee, and exclaimed in an accent from which all timidity had fled, "Oh!
				dear, oh! dear, how nice?"</p>
			<p>"What, the cake? — or the grapes? — or what?"</p>
			<p>"Taking it to mother! Taking it to mother!" cried Michael.</p>
			<p>"Then you love mother very much, Michael?" said Martha, drawing the child towards
				her, and kissing his smooth dark forehead. Michael nodded his head, and nestled
				closer to her.</p>
			<p> "Well, then, never mind about the cake at present; but I must find a little basket,
				must I not? — I will give you a basket if you will take care of it and bring it back
				to me, because perhaps we may want it again. — There, you may eat that if you are
				hungry, <pb n="63"/> while I am gone away — I shall be back again in a minute." So
				saying, she placed some bread and meat before him, and left the room. </p>
			<p>Michael had by no means lost his appetite by his morning walk to Hoxley-lane, and
				being in excellent spirits to boot, he sat down and began to devour what had been
				set before him with very zealous eagerness.</p>
			<p>He had not, however, done one-half of what he was capable of performing, when another
				door, opposite to the one by which Martha had made her <hi>exit</hi> , opened, and
				Sir Matthew Dowling walked in.</p>
			<p>Michael's knife and active fingers remained suspended midway between his mouth and
				the plate; the colour forsook his cheek, and his eye sunk as if unable to meet that
				of his munificent patron.</p>
			<p>"What stuffing still, you greedy little rascal? What have you touched with your nasty
				factory fingers? Not the grapes, I hope?"</p>
			<p>Michael tried to say "no," but did not succeed in producing the sound; so contented
				himself by letting the forefinger of his left hand drop into his plate to show how
				he had been engaged.</p>
			<p>"Don't look so like a fool, you oaf," said Sir Matthew, taking him by the shoulder,
				and shaking him with some vivacity. "You are to come along with me, do you hear
				that? and see a lot of fine folks, and to look up at them too, do you hear that; and
				by G — d if you blubber, or look grumpish, I'll have you strapped ten times over,
				worse than you ever saw done at the factory. Come along! — and mind what I have
				promised, for I'll keep it, and worse, that you may rely."</p>
			<p>Michael behaved like a little hero. He remembered the promised basket, and the voice
				that had told him he should have it; he remembered Hoxley-lane too, and his mother,
				and Teddy, and their morsel of dry bread; so he walked manfully along beside Sir
				Matthew, and when they reached the drawing-room door, and his benefactor stretched
				forth a hand to take his, he yielded it to him, with scarcely any perceptible
				shudder.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew walked some steps forward, with the boy in his hand, into the
				drawing-room, and then standing quite still, pointed to the child, and said, "Lady
				Clarissa! behold the factory-boy!"</p>
			<p>Nothing could be more skilful than this form of presentation, for it told Lady
				Clarissa every thing, and Lady Dowling nothing. Lady Clarissa sprung from her seat
				and ran towards the child. "Is it possible!" she exclaimed, with every appearance of
				violent emotion. "Oh! Sir Matthew!" these last words were audible only to the knight
				and the little boy; but as the latter could make nothing of them, and the former
				almost any thing he pleased, it was evident that the lady was as well skilled in
				saying more than met the ear, as the gentleman.</p>
			<p>"Indeed, indeed," said Lady Clarissa, drawing forth another of the coronetted
				handkerchiefs, "indeed, indeed, this is a noble act, Sir Matthew!"</p>
			<pb n="64"/>
			<p>Here her ladyship pressed her handkerchief to her eyes, and remained in the eloquent
				silence of that position for a moment, then raising herself from the softness that,
				as she hinted to Sir Matthew, in a whisper, she felt stealing upon her, she called
				to Mr. Osmond Norval, and said in a tone audible to all present, "Osmond Norval!
				favoured of Heaven, and the muse! Let not this beautiful subject escape you! Look at
				this pretty boy — look at the delicate air of aristocratic refinement which pervades
				his person. Osmond, the earth has not made her daily circuit round the sun since I
				beheld this child the very type of sordid wretchedness; would you know the hand that
				wrought this wondrous change? Would you learn what heart suggested it? Behold them
				here!" and Lady Clarissa laid her noble fingers on the coat-sleeve of Sir Matthew
				Dowling.</p>
			<p>"Her ladyship does Sir Matthew Dowling no more than justice Mr. Norval," said Doctor
				Crockley approaching the group. "This is an act that ought to be given to fame, and,
				if Sir Matthew himself does not object to it, I would suggest its being recorded by
				your pen, in such a form as may give it general circulation.</p>
			<p>The poet pressed his hand upon his heart, and bowed profoundly, and then, raising the
				other hand to his forehead, he stood for some time silently meditating on the theme
				thus offered to him. During this interval, the different groups which surrounded him
				formed a most charming picture. The young man himself stood apart, and
				unconsciously, perhaps, became the centre to which every eye-beam converged. Lady
				Clarissa and Sir Matthew, side by side, and, at no great distance from him, awaited
				his reply; her ladyship with an affectionate smile on her lip, that spoke at once
				her confidence in his power and will to do what she required of him. Sir Matthew's
				expression of countenance could not be read so plainly; it was grave, but it might
				be doubtful whether its gravity proceeded from displeasure that the answer should be
				delayed, or solely from the deep interest the subject possessed for him. Lady
				Dowling, with her hands crossed before her, was seated on a sofa exactly in front of
				them, with her light eyes rather more widely open than usual, looking straight
				forward, and her small features seeming to indicate that she was not in the sweetest
				humour in the world. Dr. Crockley, his hands in his waistcoat-pockets, and his short
				legs rather widely extended, in what dancing-masters term the second position,
				swayed himself with nice balance to and fro, as if measuring the interval of
				suspense by seconds vibrated by his person. Miss Arabella Dowling, and Miss Harriet
				Dowling sat close together upon an ottoman, "like to a double cherry," of the
				Bigarreau kind, with their four eyes so fixed upon the poet that it seemed as if
				they had but one heart and one soul between them; and on this subject at least,
				their hearts and souls, if not one, were the same; for they had both, and at the
				very same instant, fallen violently in love with Mr. Osmond Norval.</p>
			<pb n="65"/>
			<p>In a deep arm-chair, in which she had almost buried herself, sat, or rather lay,
				little Miss Brotherton, almost convulsed with laughter, and with her
				pocket-handkerchief by no means elegantly applied to her mouth (being nearly half of
				it within it), in the hope of stifling, at least, the sound of her mirth, while Mr.
				Augustus leant in an attitude of very distinguished elegance on the back of her
				chair.</p>
			<p>A little behind her appeared Miss Mogg, who was in truth neither sitting nor
				standing, but perched very insecurely on the extreme edge of a couch, which
				uncomfortable attitude she had chosen from not feeling quite certain whether she
				ought to stand like Lady Clarissa, or sit like Miss Brotherton. The first she feared
				was too dignified and distinguished for her; the last too comfortable, and she
				deserved credit for hitting upon a position so far removed from either; and lastly,
				very near the door by which he had entered, and to which he had slunk back he knew
				not how, stood Michael.</p>
			<p>This picturesque state of things having lasted quite long enough, Osmond Norval
				raised his eyes from the ground to the face of Lady Clarissa, and making a sudden
				step forwards, dropped on one knee and seized her hand. He attempted to speak, but
				for some time his voice appeared perfectly choked by emotion. At last, however, he
				recovered the power of articulation and said, "Such a subject! — Oh, heaven! — at
				your bidding too! Best and dearest Lady Clarissa! Can you doubt that all my power
				and strength will be put in requisition for it? But — may I ask — Is it to be
				published by subscription?"</p>
			<p>Without immediately replying to this interesting, and to Mr. Osmond Norval most
				important inquiry, Lady Clarissa suddenly clapped her hands together with a sort of
				vehement enthusiasm that looked very like delirium. Even Sir Matthew, though his
				intimacy with her had more than once made him the witness to some extraordinary
				freaks, looked at her with astonishment; Lady Dowling's eyes were more widely opened
				than ever; Miss Mogg instinctively thrust her hand into her bag in search of a
				smelling-bottle; and Miss Brotherton took her handkerchief out of her mouth, and
				looked grave.</p>
			<p>"I have got it! Oh, I have got it!" she exclaimed. "What a delicious idea! — Let us
				sit down! Mogg, push forward that couch, child. — Poor girl! She really is almost
				too fat to move. Gracious heaven, Sir Matthew! what would become of my etherealized
				spirit if it were so encumbered? But sit down, — sit down all of you. — Norval!
				Place yourself on that tabouret. — Mary Brotherton! Draw near and listen. — And all
				the rest of you give ear to what I am going to say, and answer the questions I shall
				ask with freedom and sincerity."</p>
			<p>Thus conjured, every one in the room, except Lady Dowling, who stirred not an inch,
				drew round the place where Lady Clarissa had seated herself, and prepared with
				considerable curiosity to hear what she was going to say.</p>
			<p>"Is not amusement the very soul of life?" she began.</p>
			<pb n="66"/>
			<p>"No doubt of it, my lady," from the lips of Dr. Crockley, was the most articulate of
				the many acquiescent answers which followed.</p>
			<p>"Is not a country neighbourhood fearfully, lamentably difficient in this?" pursued
				the animated inquirer.</p>
			<p>"There cannot be two opinions on that point," replied Sir Matthew, with
				authority.</p>
			<p>"And is it not the duty of neighbours, residing within reach of each other as we do,
				to exert every facility with which nature has endowed them, in order as much as
				possible to soften to each other the privations to which their distance from the
				metropolis obliges them to submit?"</p>
			<p>In reply to this demand, there was a perfect clamour of approbation. "Well then,"
				continued Lady Clarissa, "if such be your feelings, I am certain of success in the
				project that has come, like a spirit of light borne upon silver wings to visit my
				dull spirit. This noble act of Sir Matthew's must not pass away like an ordinary
				deed that is hardly performed, ere it be forgotten. No! it shall live in story — it
				shall live in song — it shall live again in action! Norval, dear gifted friend, did
				you ever write a drama?"</p>
			<p>"Occasionally a scene or two, Lady Clarissa."</p>
			<p>"That is enough, dear Osmond. I ask not a hackneyed worn-out pen. I will relate to
				him, Sir Matthew, this interesting anecdote exactly as it occurred — he shall
				dramatize it — perhaps introduce an episode, or underplot, to increase the business
				of the scene — we will all act it," and here Lady Clarissa gracefully bowed to the
				whole party, "and all the neighbourhood shall be assembled to enjoy the fête. What
				say you to this, Sir Matthew?"</p>
			<p>Upon my word, my lady, I think it is one of the cleverest and most agreeable ideas
				that ever entered a lady's head. If you and Mr. Norval will arrange the drama, Lady
				Clarissa, I will take care to have one of the rooms fitted up as a theatre, and
				depend upon it we shall be in no want of actors. Upon my word I never liked any idea
				so much in my life."</p>
			<p>"Will it not be pleasant, Mary Brotherton?" said Lady Clarissa, in her most caressing
				tone, to the heiress.</p>
			<p>"Very pleasant, indeed," replied the young lady. "I should ask no better fun."</p>
			<p>"And what does my Lady Dowling say?" resumed Lady Clarissa, with that stiffness of
				manner with which her ladyship now and then refreshed the memory of her plebeian
				friends, as to the difference of rank between them."</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear me, I am sure I don't know," replied Lady Dowling, looking frightened.</p>
			<p>"Well! we must not torment Lady Dowling by forcing her to act, Sir Matthew. There
				cannot be a doubt that we shall have volunteers in abundance. You will act, Mary
				Brotherton, will you not?"</p>
			<p> "Act? — Most assuredly I will act, Lady Clarissa," replied the heiress. "People as
				much at liberty to please themselves as I am, <pb n="67"/> seldom refuse to aid and
				abet a scheme so exceedingly full of amusement as this seems to be." </p>
			<p>"We will set such an example," cried Dr. Crockley, rubbing his hands joyously, "that
				every county in England shall hear of us with envy — I know what Sir Matthew can
				make of a thing if he takes to it. Leave him alone for giving the go-by to all the
				world. Write away, young gentleman, write away; depend upon it you'll have a
				theatre, and actors too, that will do you justice."</p>
			<p>At this interesting moment, just as the fair-haired Miss Dowlings began to whisper to
				each other something about characters and dresses, and Mr. Augustus to whisper to
				Miss Brotherton his hope that he should have to act a great deal with her, the great
				bell sent forth another peal, upon which Lady Clarissa held up her finger in token
				of silence; and before the new visiter entered, all the bright sallies of the party
				were as effectually extinguished as if they had been supplied by gas, which was
				suddenly turned off.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER VII. </head>
			<p>A POPULAR CHARACTER — MORE BENEVOLENCE — INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED WITH
				BECOMING ANIMATION — A SELECT COMMITTEE — A FAREWELL FULL OF MEANING.</p>
			<p>
				The person who produced this very powerful effect was a lady not
				particularly distinguished either by wealth or station; but she seemed to possess
				the faculty of finding her way into every house within her reach, whether the owner
				of it desired her presence or not.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Gabberly was the widow of a clergyman, who had formerly been vicar of the parish
				of St. Mary's, Ashleigh, and having made herself the very largest acquaintance that
				ever was enjoyed by any country lady without a carriage, she determined upon
				continuing amongst them after her husband died, as it might have taken her, she
				said, more years than she was likely to live, before she could expect to make so
				many friends all over again. She therefore, on leaving the vicarage, contented
				herself with a very small house, as near the town as possible, and went on very much
				as she had done before, only having one maid-servant instead of two, and contenting
				herself with a donkey-chair and a very little boy to drive it, instead of a
				one-horse chaise, and a steady man-servant of all work.</p>
			<p> Considering the wealth and splendour of the neighbourhood in which accident had
				first placed her, and to which choice now held her bound, it may be looked upon as a
				matter of wonder that she should have made any intimacies at all. But, though the
				vicarage <pb n="68"/> of St. Mary's, Ashleigh, was far enough from being richly
				endowed, and the private fortune of the late incumbent not such as to enable him to
				approach to any thing like an equality in his style of living to even the least
				wealthy among the manufacturers in the district, there is still a species of respect
				for the profession of a clergyman, which opens to him and his family the houses of
				many, greatly their superiors in point of wealth; and it therefore pretty generally
				depends on the clergy themselves, whether they are on intimate terms with their
				neighbours, or not. </p>
			<p>Now Mr. Gabberly, or more properly speaking, Mrs. Gabberly, who in strength of will
				had ever been his far better half, did greatly desire to be on intimate terms with
				her neighbours. Rich or poor, gentle or simple, old or young, she was determined to
				be intimate with them all. And she was intimate with them all, very intimate. One
				word more, and Mrs. Gabberly shall be left to speak for herself, which she was
				certainly able to do, with as little impediment of any kind, as most people. Mrs.
				Gabberly was the daughter of a physician; and from her earliest years had acquired
				so decided a taste for the theory and practice of medicine, that she could never
				wean herself entirely from it, but was thought by many to let it still occupy rather
				too large a share of her conversation and thoughts. Nevertheless, Mrs. Gabberly was
				exceedingly popular, for though her discourse ran much upon bruises and bowels,
				rickets and rheums, spasms and spines, it ran also upon matters more attractive. If
				she could not tell what every body for three miles round had for dinner on the very
				day on which she was speaking, it was a hundred to one but she could tell, within a
				cutlet or a hash, what they had been all eating for a week before. She knew, with an
				approach to correctness that was perfectly astonishing, the amount of every body's
				expenditure, and every body's debts; could tell to the fraction of a new ribbon, how
				many bonnets each lady consumed per annum; and was perfectly <hi>au fait</hi> of the
				quantity of corn and hay got through in every body's stables. No flirtation ever
				escaped either her eyes or her tongue, and the Morning Post was a less faithful
				record of fine parties, than the tablets of her comprehensive memory.</p>
			<p>The Dowling family was aware of all this; and each in their way had a peculiar value
				for her society, for Mrs. Gabberly knew how to be all things to all men, women, and
				children; but, at the present moment, it was Sir Matthew who felt the most decided
				movement of satisfaction at beholding her sharp black eyes, brisk step, and eager
				manner of reconnoitring every individual present, as she entered the room.</p>
			<p>"Here is my general advertiser," thought the knight, as he extended his huge hand to
				welcome her. "We will have a theatrical representation that shall immortalize my
				charity, and here's the one that shall act the part of Fame, and trumpet it round
				the country."</p>
			<p> "My goodness! what a charming party of you is got all together this morning,"
				exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly, smiling and bowing, and nodding, and courtesying, to every
				body in succession, all the time <pb n="69"/> that Sir Matthew continued his cordial
				hand-shaking. "Now you must just tell me what you are all about, for if you don't I
				shall die, and there's the truth." </p>
			<p>"No, no, Mrs. Gabberly, you shan't die, if we can save your life," replied Sir
				Matthew, in his most jovial tone. "We are a gay and happy party, at this moment, I
				do believe, one and all," and here the knight thought proper to send a glance after
				little Michael, who, notwithstanding his fine clothes, was looking pale and sad
				enough, in the most distant corner from the principal group to which he had been
				able to creep.</p>
			<p>The experienced eye of Sir Matthew read past suffering and present terror in his
				speaking features, and he cursed the trembling child in his heart of hearts. But Sir
				Matthew Dowling might have removed as many coatings as the grave-digger in Hamlet,
				ere the looker-on could have penetrated so far; and it must have been a quick
				observer that could have detected the sort of lurid glare that for half an instant
				gleamed in the savage look he cast upon the boy. It was for no longer space that his
				joyous gaiety was obscured, and he then turned again his admiring glances upon the
				Lady Clarissa, and resumed his speech.</p>
			<p>"This is the person, Mrs. Gabberly, who must let you into the mystery. You must
				entreat her ladyship to be pleased to inform you what it is she is going to make us
				all do."</p>
			<p>"Well then, I hope her ladyship won't refuse. You won't be so cruel, will you, my
				lady?"</p>
			<p>"No, certainly!" replied Lady Clarissa smiling complacently on the knight. "If Sir
				Matthew complies with my proposal, I shall have no objection to its being proclaimed
				to all the world."</p>
			<p>And here glances were exchanged between the knight and the lady, perfectly
				intelligible to each other, and which said very distinctly, "Ah! Lady Clarissa!" on
				the one part; and, "Oh! Sir Matthew! on the other.</p>
			<p>"Speak then, my lady!" said the gallant manufacturer with a low bow; "and whatever
				you shall say, shall be law."</p>
			<p>"Now then, ladies and gentlemen! all of you give ear; for not Mrs. Gabberly alone,
				but every one present, should pay attention to what I am about to say." And here
				Lady Clarissa turned her eyes round about her in search of the hero of the scene.
				"Where is the little boy?" said she, in a tone of great theatrical feeling.</p>
			<p> "Come here, my dear little fellow!" said Sir Matthew, again turning his glances
				towards Michael, and now looking amiable and benignant with all his might. But the
				child seemed to wither beneath this sunshine, even more conspicuously than when he
				had been left in the shade; and it was not till the knight made some gigantic
				strides forwards to meet him, that poor Michael formed the desperate courage
				necessary to bring him from his corner to the spot where his noble benefactress
				stood. Nay, the last steps were not made without the helping hand of Sir Matthew,
				which heavily laid upon his shoulder performed a twofold office; ostensibly
				caressing, <pb n="70"/> while, in truth, it forcibly impelled the little trembler
				forward. </p>
			<p>"Now then, Mrs. Gabberly," said Lady Clarissa, "look at this interesting little
				fellow! It is he who is the hero of our <hi>fête</hi> ."</p>
			<p>"Indeed! And pray what may the young gentleman's name be?" said Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
			<p>"Is not that delicious?" cried Lady Clarissa. "Oh, Sir Matthew! how I envy you your
				feelings! Note that, dear Norval. The touch is exquisitely dramatic, and must on no
				account be omitted. This <hi>young gentleman</hi> , Mrs. Gabberly," continued Lady
				Clarissa, with increasing animation, "this young gentleman as you most naturally
				call him, was a few short hours ago, a wretched, ragged beggar-boy! Sir Matthew
				Dowling, from motives, that I dare not wound his generous heart by thus publicly
				dwelling upon, has rescued him from poverty and destruction. This deed, so beautiful
				in itself, and so beneficial in its influence as an example, is about to be
				immortalized as it ought to be, by the pen, the rapid, brilliant, touching pen of my
				young friend, Mr. Osmond Norval. He has undertaken to dramatize this charming trait
				of benevolence, and our excellent Sir Matthew, has consented to fit up a little
				theatre for the representation of it, at which all the neighbourhood are to be
				present as invited guests."</p>
			<p>"Well now! If ever I heard any thing so delightful as that!" exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly,
				clapping her hands in ecstasy. "Are the cards sent out, Sir Matthew?"</p>
			<p>"Not yet, Mrs. Gabberly," replied the knight, with his most friendly smile; "but
				depend upon it that when they are, you will not be forgotten."</p>
			<p>"Well now, my dear Lady Dowling! I am sure you are always so kind to me!" cried the
				delighted Mrs. Gabberly, making her way towards the sofa, where sat the lady of the
				mansion in frowning state; "I should not wonder if you were to contrive a bed for me
				on this great occasion, it would be just like you. And oh! my! I have got such a
				quantity of things I want to tell you, but I can't stop one instant longer now, if
				you'd give me the whole world. So, good by to you all, my dears! I've heard
				something about you, Miss Arabella, but it must keep, my dear; and I've a secret for
				Miss Harriet's ear, too, when we have got leisure. But, good by, good by! Good
				morning, my Lady Clarissa," and away bustled Sir Matthew's <hi>public
					advertiser</hi> to spread the glorious news of private theatricals at Dowling
				Lodge, throughout the country. She paused for one moment, however, as she passed by
				Michael; and putting her hand upon his head, so as to make him turn his face up
				towards her, she said, after looking at him very earnestly,</p>
			<p>"Well now, for a beggar-child, he is to be sure the genteelest-looking little fellow,
				I ever did see; but, perhaps that may be owing to his being so pale and thin, which
				is certainly a great deal more elegant than fatness and red cheeks, though it don't
				quite seem so healthy."</p>
			<pb n="71"/>
			<p>"Oh! he is in perfect health, I do assure you, Mrs. Gabberly, as you would have said,
				if you had seen the dear little fellow eating his luncheon with us just now," said
				the amiable Sir Matthew chucking him under the chin. "But, by the way," continued
				the merry knight, "I rather suspect that I called him away before he had quite
				finished, and that's what it is makes him look so doleful, isn't it, dear? Well!
				never be ashamed about it — go back again, there's a darling! and don't forget to
				take a nice bit home to mother and brother — d'ye hear, Michael? Pretty fellow! how
				he blushes!"</p>
			<p>And here the benevolent Sir Matthew himself opened the door leading to the
				dining-room, and playfully pushed the "darling" through it.</p>
			<p>"Well now!" again exclaimed the astonished Mrs. Gabberly "did ever any body see such
				a beautiful spectacle of charity as that?"</p>
			<p>And without waiting for any reply, the brisk little lady made her exit without
				further pause or delay of any kind, and so completely charged "to the top of her
				bent" with wonderful intelligence, that she actually suffered from the repletion
				till half a dozen gossippings had relieved it.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the party she left resolved themselves into a committee of management upon
				the business in hand. Mr. Osmond Norval was entreated to urge his eloquent pen with
				the greatest possible rapidity; while on his part, Sir Matthew promised that the
				necessary workmen should immediately be employed in preparing one of the largest
				rooms in the house as a theatre.</p>
			<p>When the consultation reached this point, Lady Dowling suddenly rose and left the
				room; but this circumstance did not appear to produce much emotion in any of the
				party, and they remained together in a most delightful state of hubbub and
				excitement till the heiress grew tired, and ventured to hint that she thought it
				would be best for her to drive home first, and then send her carriage back for the
				accommodation of her noble friend.</p>
			<p>This proposal brought the meeting to a conclusion; but not till Lady Clarissa had
				confessed in a whisper to Sir Matthew, that she never in her whole life remembered
				to have taken any thing that did her so much good, as the delicious grapes he had
				sent home with her the evening before.</p>

			<p>A VERY INNOCENT TÉTE-À-TÊTE, BUT IN WHICH MISS MARTHA DOWLING COMES TO A WRONG
				CONCLUSION — AN UNFORTUNATE EMBASSY — AN AGREEABLE EXCURSION — A PHILOSOPHICAL
				DISQUISITION — A VISIT TO THE FACTORY.</p>
			<p>
				While these things were going on in my Lady Dowling's morning
				drawing-room, the forgotten Martha — forgotten at least by all but little Michael —
				employed herself in seeking such a basket, as might answer the purpose of a viaticum
				between the object of her father's charity, and the mother and brother of whom he
				had so fondly spoken. Having at length succeeded in her quest, she returned to the
				dining-room, and was almost as much disappointed at finding the object of her
				good-natured exertions flown, as the poor child himself had been, when obliged to
				quite the room to which this kind friend had promised to return. But Martha, though
				not a person very highly favoured by circumstances, was nevertheless better off than
				Michael, inasmuch as by keeping out of sight she could pretty generally contrive to
				remain where she chose, and do what she liked. These enviable privileges enabled her
				now to sit down at one of the large open windows of the diningroom, and to draw from
				her unseemly-sized pocket, a volume of Shakspeare, with which she determined to
				beguile the time till the boy should return, or till by some means or other, she
				might be able to discover what had become of him.</p>
			<p>When therefore, impelled by the playful, but very effectual impulse of Sir Matthew's
				shove, Michael once more entered the dining-parlour, he had the satisfaction of
				being again greeted by the friendly eye and friendly voice, which had already so
				greatly cheered him.</p>
			<p>"So, here you are again, my little man," said Martha, repocketing her book, and
				rising; "I thought you would hardly forget the basket: see, here it is, and now you
				shall help me pack it."</p>
			<p>The help thus asked for, was afforded by the happy child's holding the basket in his
				hand, as he followed her round the table, while with a smile that spoke as much
				pleasure as his own, she selected all sorts of good things to put into it.</p>
			<p>"There! now I don't think we can put in any more, Michael; so set off, and carry it
				to your mother."</p>
			<p>With eyes beaming rapture, and little hands that trembled with delight, Michael
				closed the lid of the basket, and proceeded towards the door; but ere he had fully
				reached it, he stopped short, and addressing Martha, in a tone as fearless and
				confidential as if she had been his sister, he said,</p>
			<p>"But what d'ye think about Teddy? Mightn't I change into my old clothes again, and
				just step into the factory for one minute? Teddy can't almost never eat the dinner
				as we takes to the factory, and a bit of this would do him so much good! — May
				I?"</p>
			<pb n="73"/>
			<p>"Upon my word, Michael, I am rather puzzled what to say," replied his friend; "as
				papa has ordered you to have these clothes, he might not be pleased at your taking
				them off again, and it would be a great pity to make him angry with you when he is
				so very good and kind, wouldn't it?"</p>
			<p>Michael hung his head, and said nothing.</p>
			<p>"But why need you change your clothes, my dear boy? — I dare say Teddy would be very
				proud to see you look so nice."</p>
			<p>Still Michael answered not, but began assiduously picking to pieces the handle of
				Martha's delicate basket.</p>
			<p>"Don't do that, dear," said Martha, approaching, and taking the offending hand in
				hers; "but tell me what you are thinking about?"</p>
			<p>"I am thinking," said Michael, "that if I walked into the midst of 'em this way, and
				up to poor Teddy, in his dirty ragged clothes, it would look" — and here he stopped
				without finishing the sentence.</p>
			<p>"It would look, how? — as if you were proud, perhaps?" said Martha.</p>
			<p>The child shook his head.</p>
			<p>"No, not that. Teddy would not think that," he replied.</p>
			<p>"What would he think, then? — Tell me all that is passing in your little head, and
				then I shall be able to advise you."</p>
			<p>"Why, he'd think," said Michael, and tears started as he spoke — "he'd think that he
				and I could never be right down brothers any more."</p>
			<p>Martha involuntarily kissed the little face that was turned up to hers, but replied,
				laughingly,</p>
			<p>"Oh! that's foolish, Michael; do you think that a fine jacket could separate two
				little brothers that love each other? — I think I could love you quite as well in a
				shabby coat, as in a fine one."</p>
			<p>Michael looked at her very earnestly for a minute or two, and then said, almost in a
				whisper, "Is Sir Matthew Dowling, as owns our factory, your father?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, Michael," replied Martha, colouring from some painful feeling which the
				expression of the boy's speaking features had given rise to. The child coloured too,
				but said, with good courage,</p>
			<p>"Please, ma'am, I should love Teddy just as well, and Teddy would love me, only the
				others may-be would mock at him and me too — and I know Teddy could not bear
				it."</p>
			<p>"Then they would not be as good children as I think you are. But tell me, Michael,
				something about the mill: papa has never let us see it yet, but I believe it is only
				because mamma thinks it is a dirty place. Is it very dirty, Michael?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, please ma'am."</p>
			<p> "And what makes it so, my dear? The cotton that goes into it looks as white as snow.
				I never can get any body to tell me any thing about a mill, but I think it must be
				very curious — and I want to know, Michael, what good such very little creatures as
				you can do there; yet I have heard papa say, that he pays a vast quantity of money
				to quite little children, and that's the reason, he says, that <pb n="74"/> the
				factories are such a blessing to the country. You get wages, don't you, my little
				fellow?" </p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am; I gets two shilling a week, and Teddy eighteen-pence, 'cause he's
				weaker."</p>
			<p>"That is not much, to be sure; but it's better than nothing, isn't it?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
			<p>"Do the children in general like it?"</p>
			<p>"Like what, ma'am?"</p>
			<p>"Working in the factory, my dear, and getting money for their poor parents."</p>
			<p>"The children likes to have the wages," replied Michael.</p>
			<p>"But perhaps they do not like to do any work for them, Michael?" said Martha,
				laughing. "That's what papa says. But it is not right, my dear, for little boys and
				girls to be always at play, you know. Don't you think, Michael that it is proper for
				poor people's children to do something to help themselves if they can?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Michael, but in so low a tone, that it was as much as Martha could
				do to hear it; and so melancholy a look accompanied the words, that she could not
				help thinking there was a great deal of truth in what she had constantly heard
				repeated by most of her father's friends and neighbours, as well as himself —
				namely, that the factory children were a race of very idle, ungrateful little
				creatures; spoilt by the high wages and indulgence they received, and quite
				unconscious of the inestimable advantages they possessed over all the other children
				in the British dominions.</p>
			<p>But, nevertheless, though this disagreeable conviction pressed very painfully upon
				her, Martha could not help feeling very kindly disposed towards little Michael; and
				upon his presently saying, "Shall I go to mother and Teddy, if you please, ma'am?"
				she almost forgot all the naughtiness she attributed to him and his fraternity, and
				only remembering the disadvantage that any disobedience to her father's wishes might
				bring upon him, said, "Wait one moment, Michael, and I will find papa, and ask if
				you may change your dress, in order to visit your brother in the factory."</p>
			<p>So saying, she left the room, and having ascertained that the visiters were gone,
				ventured to seek her father in the drawing-room; where she found him deep in
				consultation with Dr. Crockley, his two eldest daughters, and his son, as to the
				possibility of converting the school-room into a theatre: all being of opinion that
				the great drawing-room must be reserved for the ball, and the dining-room for the
				supper, which it was agreed on all sides must follow the representation.</p>
			<p>"May I speak to you, papa?" said Martha, timidly, on perceiving that the whole party
				were exceedingly earnest upon some theme or other.</p>
			<p>"Oh! goodness, Martha, don't come to plague us now!" exclaimed Arabella.</p>
			<p>"It is very odd, but Martha always does come in the way of every thing," said
				Harriet.</p>
			<pb n="75"/>
			<p>"I wish you were married or buried, child!" cried the lively Augustus; "for you make
				a monstrous bad had at playing the young lady of fashion. Upon my life you grow
				fatter every day. Doesn't she, doctor? I wish you would dose her a little."</p>
			<p>"That Miss Martha is a little opaque, I will not deny," replied Dr. Crockley,
				familiarly coming behind her, and measuring the expanse of her waist with his two
				hands.</p>
			<p>"May I speak to you, papa?" repeated the patient Martha, quietly retreating from the
				jocose hands of Dr. Crockley, but apparently quite insensible to all the other
				attacks.</p>
			<p>"What do you want to say, Martha?" demanded Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p>Thus much encouraged, she drew near and whispered to him, "The little boy that you
				have taken in, papa, wants to know if he may put on his old clothes again, and go to
				speak to his brother in the factory?"</p>
			<p>"Do you hear this, doctor?" exclaimed Sir Matthew; "the boy wants to go back to the
				factory again. Isn't that an answer to all the trash that people have been trying to
				get up about their being over-worked? It is just like 'em — that's the very model of
				a factory child — do what you will, you can never content 'em."</p>
			<p>"The chap want's to get back to the factory?" said Dr. Crockley, addressing himself
				to Martha, with an accent that indicated surprise. "That's curious enough, any
				how."</p>
			<p>"No, sir, I do not believe he wants to do any more than speak to his brother, who is
				at work there — he wanted to take him something that was left at luncheon,
				papa."</p>
			<p>"And to show off his own good living to the factory? That's it, I suspect, doctor;
				one can understand that — and what do you say to it? I should have no objection, I
				think; what's your opinion? only I don't see the fun of his going in his old rags,
				if he went as you saw him just now, it would make some fun, wouldn't it?"</p>
			<p>"Capital, by Jove!" replied the doctor. "How quick you are, Sir Matthew! you seize
				every thing in a moment. What do you say to our going along with him? Mightn't we
				catch a hint or two, as to how things were going on?"</p>
			<p>"If I'm quick, Crockley, upon my soul you are not slow," replied the knight. "You've
				got your horse here, of course?" The doctor nodded assent. "Then I will order mine,
				and we'll ride down to the mill together. So get along, Martha, and tell the boy
				that I will take him to the factory with me, but that he is not to change his
				clothes."</p>
			<p>Martha felt quite aware that she had not executed her commission successfully. But
				there was no help for it, and therefore with the best grace she could, she told her
				little client the result of it.</p>
			<p>The whole aspect of the boy changed as he heard it, and, as if instinctively, he
				placed the precious basket, that till now he had continued to hold firmly in his
				hand, upon a table near him.</p>
			<p>"But take your basket, Michael," said the kind-hearted Martha, in a voice that was
				intended to cheer him; "I am sure papa won't be angry at your doing that, for I told
				him about it."</p>
			<p>"No, please ma'am, I'd rather not," said Michael.</p>
			<pb n="76"/>
			<p>"Well, then, go into the hall, by that door, and wait till Sir Matthew comes through.
				Perhaps he will speak to you about it, and at any rate you had better carry it as
				far as that."</p>
			<p>The child obeyed her, and taking up again the treasure he no longer valued, passed
				out into the hall; but before Sir Matthew and his friend entered it, Michael had put
				the worthless basket out of sight.</p>
			<p>Hardly had he done so, when he heard the coarse laugh of Sir Matthew and the
				respondent titter of the doctor approaching. The little fellow started, and jumped
				aside, in order to place himself out of their way; but the knight, striding to the
				place where he stood, seized him by the shoulder with his hand, while with a
				vigorous action of his enormous foot, he sent him forward towards the house-door.
				This feat, which was performed with considerable dexterity, met its reward, in the
				shout of laughter with which Dr. Crockley welcomed it. "By Jove, Sir Matthew!" he
				exclaimed, as soon as he had recovered his breath; "there is nothing like you on the
				face of God's earth. — It is a confounded monopoly though, let me tell you. No man
				has a right to be the deepest reasoner, the best jester, and the most finished man
				of taste of his age. It's monstrous, Sir knight, and a conspiracy against you would
				be a very honest plot."</p>
			<p>And as he spoke he held his sides, as if still suffering from the effects of his
				excessive merriment.</p>
			<p>A servant who followed the facetious pair now opened the door, and on the broad
				esplanade of gravel before it a couple of grooms were holding the gentlemen's
				horses. As soon as they were seated in their saddles, with a mounted attendant
				behind them, the great manufacturer turned round his head to seek the object of his
				charity. Michael stood doubting and trembling on the lowest step of the portico,
				while a faint hope fluttered at his heart, that the grand gentlemen would ride away
				and forget him; but it was quickly chased by the voice of Sir Matthew, who, bringing
				his horse's head so close upon the child, as to touch him, while he seemed almost to
				shrink into the pillar by which he stood, to escape it, said in a voice, the jeering
				tone of which again almost convulsed Dr. Crockley with laughter,</p>
			<p>"Pray, young gentleman, may you happen to know the way to Brookford factory?"</p>
			<p>The boy looked out upon the wide-spreading park; and though, despite the
				carefully-chosen position of the mansion, many towering grim-looking chimney cones
				were seen to rise amidst their own lurid smoke in the distance (for in that
				direction lay the town of Ashleigh), he could catch no glimpse of the hated walls
				that for years past had formed his daily prison-house. He, therefore, answered, but
				not very audibly, "No, sir, if you please."</p>
			<p>"Speak up, my hero!" vociferated Sir Matthew, advancing upon him, — "Yes, or no?"</p>
			<p>"No;" replied the boy, distinctly.</p>
			<p>"Then be pleased to have the kindness to do me the favour of following my horse, and
				I will have the honour of showing you the way."</p>
			<pb n="77"/>
			<p>So saying, sir Matthew gave a merry look of intelligence to his friend, and they set
				off together at a brisk trot.</p>
			<p>Michael, for a piecer, <ref target="#ENG18400N1">[1]</ref> was a tall child for his age; and, though his limbs were
				wretchedly thin and attenuated, they had sufficient elasticity to enable him for
				some time to keep at no great distance, though it was a constantly increasing one,
				from the two gentleman; but, by degrees, his breath and strength failed, and
				perforce his speed relaxed into a panting, shuffling, walk.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew, who from time to time turned round a laughing face to look at him, now
				reined up his horse and awaited his approach; upon which Michael redoubled his
				efforts, and in a few minutes stood beside his benefactor.</p>
			<p>"Step on, young gentleman; step a little quicker, if you please; or, perhaps, I may
				find a way to mend your pace: I am not very fond of such lazy company." And, suiting
				his action to his words, he gave the quivering child several sharp cuts across the
				shoulders with his riding-whip.</p>
			<p>"He trots out in style now, doesn't he, doctor?" said Sir Matthew gaily, making his
				well-bitted horse cross and recross the road in such a manner, that, at each
				manoeuvre, the goaded child fancied himself already trampled beneath his feet.
				"Don't you think I should make a good dancing-master, Crockley?"</p>
			<p>"Capital, by Jove! — Egad, the youngster has learned some vastly pretty steps
				already. By the way, Sir Matthew," continued the philosophical physician, "when one
				watches that pale-faced young scamp making such active caprioles for no reason on
				the earth, but because he hears your pretty gentle jennet snuffing at his shoulder,
				— when one watches that, it is impossible not to see that nothing in God's world but
				sheer wilful laziness makes those obstinate little brutes, at the factory, pretend
				to totter, and stumble, and faint, and the devil knows what; when all their work is
				to walk backwards and forwards as leisurely as if they were parading for pleasure.
				Nothing shall ever make me believe but that all the grunting and grumbling we hear
				about overworked children, proceeds from a regular conspiracy among the worst of the
				parents. And, upon my soul, if you yield to it, you'll soon have to look after the
				wheels yourself."</p>
			<p>"Get on with ye, to the lodge there, you lazy cur," said the knight, addressing his
				panting protégé, "and wait till we come up." Then reining up his horse, Sir Matthew
				drew close to his highly-valued intellectual companion, and falling into a gentle
				foot-pace, continued the scientific discussion with deep interest, and a wonderful
				clearness of perception.</p>
			<p> "It is quite curious to me, Crockley," he said, "to observe how common sense and
				observation will often make a man of tolerable ability hit upon the very same facts,
				and come exactly to the very same conclusions as the man of science, who has passed
					<pb n="78"/> his whole life in study. What you have mentioned now, is precisely
				what has occurred to me over and over again, a thousand times, I am sure, at the
				very least, since I have been working Brookford factory. For just watch, my dear
				Crockley, any little village vagabond that you may chance to see as you ride about
				the country — just watch him at play; and tell me where you'll find a grown man that
				can keep moving as he does?" </p>
			<p>"Nowhere, Sir Matthew, nowhere upon the face of the earth; and it stands to reason,
				in spite of all that the confounded canters can say to the contrary, that nature
				made them so on purpose. Why, what's steam? — Let them answer me that. Is steam
				man's making? Isn't it sent by Providence? And what for, I should like to know?
				Isn't it for the good of mankind? And how is that good to be had, if the nimbleness
				of children is not brought to bear upon it? It is neither more nor less than a most
				shocking impiety, Sir Matthew; and, upon my soul, if I were you I would build a
				meeting-house of my own, and hire a preacher too, at a pretty good salary, to preach
				against it. But no Church of England parson remember; because, if they don't preach
				the doctrine you like, you would have no power to turn 'em out."</p>
			<p>"You're right, Crockley. That's a devilish good idea; I'll turn it over in my head,
				and I shall like to hear some more of your notions about it. By the way, Crockley,
				you must not think of going home to dinner to-day. We'll have a cool bottle of
				claret, and talk the matter comfortably over. And there's another thing, too, I want
				to speak to you about. There's a devilish deal of talk about the health of the
				factory brats; and I have a notion of appointing a regular medical practitioner upon
				my establishment, who might always be ready, if called upon, to answer any questions
				that might be asked. Now, I hear you are a man, Crockley, capable of obliging a
				friend that deserves it; and, if it's agreeable to you, instead of looking in now
				and then to give us an opinion as you do now, you shall have a regular appointment,
				with a couple of hundred a year, just to look after the health of the children."</p>
			<p>"I should like such an arrangement exceedingly well, Sir Matthew. You know my love of
				science; and this would give me a capital opportunity for speculating upon different
				constitutions. Egad, Sir Matthew, I should like to write a book upon the subject. I
				think a monstrous deal of good might be done that way."</p>
			<p>"No doubt about it, Crockley: a clever fellow, like you, may throw an amazing deal of
				light upon a subject that is really becoming exceedingly important; especially when
				one recollects that the national wealth and prosperity depends upon it altogether.
				You must come and dine with me often, Crockley, without any ceremony; and we may be
				able to hit out many a good thing over the bottle."</p>
			<p> The two gentlemen now reached the lodge-gates, where little Michael stood waiting
				for them; and as the high-road soon turned in such a direction as to make Brookford
				factory visible, he was ordered to run on, and wait at the gates without minding
				them. They accordingly proceeded in their conversation without interruption; and in
				the course of it, some very excellent hints were thrown out <pb n="79"/> relative to
				the manufacturing interests in general, and to that of Brookford factory in
				particular. </p>
			<p>Having reached the gates of what was generally termed his "Magnificent
				establishment," and waited till the stylish groom in attendance upon him came up,
				Sir Matthew, and his estimable friend, left their horses with him, and entered the
				court, which, protected by a very lofty wall, surrounded the buildings on all
				sides.</p>
			<p>Those persons who have, once in their lives, seen a large cotton-factory, need no
				description of it; for it has features which, once looked upon, can never be
				forgotten; but, for the information of those who have not, a slight sketch of Sir
				Matthew Dowling's establishment shall be given.</p>
			<p>It consisted of very extensive buildings constructed in the centre of the enclosed
				court, and forming three sides of a vast square; the fourth being open on the side
				fronting the principal gates of entrance. When it is stated that the edifice
				consisted of six stories, and that each side of it presented six lines of windows,
				containing forty windows in each line, some idea of its magnitude may be
				conceived.</p>
			<p>Michael was already at the gates, and, on the approach of Sir Matthew, rang the bell;
				a ceremony necessary to obtain admittance both for masters and labourers; no means
				of entrance or exit being ever left unsecured for a single instant.</p>
			<p>The summons was answered by a lame boy, stationed within to perform the office of
				porter. He bent low before the great man, and low too before his jeering friend;
				though the jocose visits of the latter to the factory were dreaded as much as the
				lash itself.</p>
			<p>Neither the one nor the other seemed to see him, but passed on. Then followed poor
				little Michael, hating most cordially the bravery of the attire, which made him
				expect to meet the ridicule, rather than the sympathy, of his late companions.</p>
			<p>On seeing a young stranger, the lame porter looked up; but from him, at least,
				Michael had nothing to fear; for the boy's languid eye surveyed his altered person,
				without the slightest suspicion of ever having seen it before. Sir Matthew, like
				most others of his craft, was not in the habit of indulging his family by exhibiting
				to them the secret arcana of that hideous mystery by which the delicate forms of
				young children are made to mix and mingle with the machinery, from whence flows the
				manufacturer's wealth. This divine portion of the vast engine being considered,
				however, as a very inferior, though necessary, part of it. But, although they had
				never honoured the premises with a visit, it was, of course, well known to all that
				Sir Matthew Dowling was the father of a numerous progeny; and Michael passed on
				amidst such blessings as human nature, under such circumstances, was likely to
				bestow on one of them.</p>
			<p> The party entered the building, whence — as all know who have done the like — every
				sight, every sound, every scent that kind nature has fitted to the organs of her
				children, so as to render the <pb n="80"/> mere unfettered use of them a delight,
				are banished for ever and for ever. The ceaseless whirring of a million hissing
				wheels, seizes on the tortured ear; and while threatening to destroy the delicate
				sense, seems bent on proving first, with a sort of mocking mercy, of how much
				suffering it can be the cause. The scents that reek around, from oil, tainted water,
				and human filth, with that last worst nausea, arising from the hot refuse of
				atmospheric air, left by some hundred pairs of labouring lungs, render the act of
				breathing a process of difficulty, disgust, and pain. All this is terrible. But what
				the eye brings home to the heart of those, who look round upon the horrid earthly
				hell, is enough to make it all forgotten; for who can think of villanous smells, or
				heed the suffering of the earracking sounds, while they look upon hundreds of
				helpless children, divested of every trace of health of joyousness, and even of
				youth! Assuredly there is no exaggeration in this; for except only in their
				diminutive size, these suffering infants have no trace of it. Lean and distorted
				limbs — sallow and sunken cheeks — dim hollow eyes, that speak unrest and most
				unnatural carefulness, give to each tiny, trembling, unelastic form, a look of
				hideous premature old age. </p>
			<p>But in the room they entered, the dirty, ragged, miserable crew, were all in active
				performance of their various tasks; the overlookers, strap in hand, on the alert;
				the whirling spindles urging the little slaves who waited on them, to movements as
				unceasing as their own; and the whole monstrous chamber, redolent of all the various
				impurities that "by the perfection of our manufacturing system," are converted into
				"gales of Araby" for the rich, after passing in the shape of certain poison, through
				the lungs of the poor. So Sir Matthew proudly looked about him, and approved; and
				though it was athwart that species of haughty frown, in which such dignity as his is
				apt to clothe itself, Dr. Crockley failed not to perceive, that his friend and
				patron was in good humour, and likely to be pleased by any light and lively jestings
				in which he might indulge. Perceiving, therefore, that little Michael passed on with
				downcast eyes, unrecognised by any, he wrote upon a slip of paper, for he knew his
				voice could not be heard "Make the boy take that bare-legged scavenger wench round
				the neck, and give her a kiss while she is next lying down, and let us see them
				sprawling together."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew read the scroll, and grinned applause.</p>
			<p> The miserable creature to whom the facetious doctor pointed, was a little girl about
				seven years old, whose office as " <hi>scavenger</hi> ," was to collect incessantly
				from the machinery and from the floor, the flying fragments of cotton that might
				impede the work. In the performance of this duty, the child was obliged, from time
				to time, to stretch itself with sudden quickness on the ground, while the hissing
				machinery passed over her; and when this is skilfully done, and the head, body, and
				outstretched limbs carefully glued to the floor, the steady-moving, but threatening
				mass, may pass and repass over the dizzy head and trembling body without touching
				it. <pb n="81"/> But accidents frequently occur; and many are the flaxen locks,
				rudely torn from infant heads, in the process. </p>
			<p>It was a sort of vague hope that something comical of this kind might occur, which
				induced Dr. Crockley to propose this frolic to his friend, and probably the same
				idea suggested itself to Sir Matthew likewise.</p>
			<p>"I say, Master Michael!" vociferated the knight in a scream, which successfully
				struggled with the din, "show your old acquaintance that pride has not got the upper
				hand of you in your fine clothes. Take scavenger, No. 3, there, round the neck; now
				— now — now, as she lies sprawling, and let us see you give her a hearty kiss."</p>
			<p>The stern and steady machinery moved onward, passing over the body of the little
				girl, who owed her safety to the miserable leanness of her shrunken frame; but
				Michael moved not.</p>
			<p>"Are you deaf, you little vermin?" roared Sir Matthew. "Now she's down again. — Do
				what I bid you, or by the living God you shall smart for it!"</p>
			<p>Still Michael did not stir, neither did he speak; or if he did, his young voice was
				wholly inaudible, and the anger of Sir Matthew was demonstrated by a clenched fist
				and threatening brow. "Where the devil is Parsons?" he demanded in accents that poor
				Michael both heard and understood. "Fine as he is, the strap will do him good."</p>
			<p>In saying this, the great man turned to reconnoitre the space he had traversed, and
				by which his confidential servant must approach, and found that he was already
				within a good yard of him.</p>
			<p>"That's good — I want you Parsons. Do you see this little rebel here, that I have
				dressed and treated like one of my own children? What d'ye think of his refusing to
				kiss Miss No. 3, scavenger, when I bid him?"</p>
			<p>"The devil he does?" said the manager grinning; "we must see if we can't mend that.
				Mind your hits, Master Piecer, and salute the young lady when the mules go back,
				like a gentleman."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew perceived that his favourite agent feared to enforce his first brutal
				command, and was forced, therefore, to content himself with seeing the oiled and
				grimy face of the filthy little girl in contact with that of the now clean and
				delicate-looking Michael. But he felt he had been foiled, and cast a glance upon his
					<hi>protégé</hi> , which seemed to promise that he would not forget it.</p>
			<p>Having made known to the superintendent, that it was his pleasure to enter the room
				where the brother of Michael was at work, Mr. Parsons led the way to the fifth floor
				of the building; Sir Matthew, however, ordering the door of each chamber, as he
				passed up, to be opened for him, that he might look in upon his stifling slaves, and
				satisfy himself that neither wheels nor sinews were loitering in unthrifty
				repose.</p>
			<p> The air that issued from each, was nauseous; and on entering the room, at the
				farther end of which Edward Armstrong was employed, <pb n="82"/> Dr. Crockley
				secretly resolved, that when making the final arrangements for his promised
				appointment, it should be specified that he should never enter the working portion
				of the establishment. For though by no means a particularly scientific practitioner,
				the little doctor knew quite enough of the business he followed, to be aware that,
				in his own case at least, the air which filled it, could not be breathed with
				impunity. </p>
			<p>"Now then, sir," said Sir Matthew, addressing himself to Michael, while Parsons
				opened the door on the fifth floor, and announced that this was the room that
				contained Edward. "Now, sir, walk on, and find your brother; and, if your pride does
				not stand in your way, let him be made to understand all the extraordinary kindness
				I have shown you. Take care that you let him and all his companions know that I have
				adopted you as one of my own family; and that henceforward, they will always see you
				dressed as well as you are at present."</p>
			<p>All that Michael clearly understood from this harangue was, that he had permission to
				go forward and speak to his brother; and though not venturing quite to run, he moved
				onward at a pace that speedily brought him within sight of Edward. The little fellow
				who, despite his gay disguise, immediately recognised him, uttered a cry of joy.
				"Love conquered fear;" and dropping the reel he had just taken between his fingers,
				he rushed from the place he occupied before the mules, and the next moment was
				fondly clasped in his brother's arms.</p>
			<p>Every labourer in the factory, within sight of the spot where this meeting took
				place, forgot all standing orders in their astonishment, and stood with gaping
				mouths and eyes fixed upon the astounding spectacle. Sir Matthew, too, forgot for an
				instant, that every movement made within that crowded chamber, not having for its
				object the transmutation of human life into gold, was a positive loss to him; for
				the display of his extraordinary benevolence was, he conceived, of high importance,
				and he looked round with great contentment on the multitude of wondering faces which
				he saw peering over the machinery in all directions, to gaze on the sight he had
				prepared for them.</p>
			<p>"This will be talked of, or the devil is in it," thought he. "I should like to know
				who would dare to mention night work and hard usage now. A capital scheme this, as
				ever was hit upon."</p>
			<p>And from the gazers, he now turned his eyes upon the object that fixed their
				attention, when, to his inconceivable astonishment and rage, he perceived that the
				two boys, who still stood locked in each other's arms, were both weeping
				bitterly."</p>
			<p> "Not loud, but deep," were the curses that he breathed against the unfortunate
				object of his affected bounty; and faithfully did he pledge a promise to his own
				heart, that he should pay for the vexation he thus occasioned him. But for the
				present, he condescended <pb n="83"/> to veil the feeling by a smile more bland than
				any one ever before witnessed from him within those walls; and striding forwards to
				the sobbing children, he laid a hand on the shoulder of each, while he said in a
				voice that seemed endowed by nature with an especial power of competing with the
				thunder of a cotton-mill — </p>
			<p>"Come, come, my dears! I know you are crying for joy; but you must not go on so, or
				it will look as if little Michael was ungrateful for all I have done for him! Have
				you told your brother, dear, how I ordered you to take some nice things home to your
				mother? That will make him look up, I'll answer for it! There, now I'll leave you
				here that you may tell all your friends that you have been made a gentleman of, on
				account of your good behaviour, and because you was faithful to your master. Let
				them have ten minutes, Parsons, with the mules standing still, that they may all
				hear the story."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew then turned about, and hastened out of the factory, followed by Dr.
				Crockley; and as they slowly rode homewards by some round-about lanes that were
				shaded from the sun, they discussed high thoughts, — "Such as Lycurgus loved, When
				he bade flog the little Spartans." And ere they reached the luxurious abode of the
				knight, had between them sketched such a scheme of political, moral, and religious
				defence for the factory system in all its branches, and in all its bearings, that
				the doctor as he descended from his horse, snapped his fingers triumphantly,
				exclaiming, "A fig for them all, Sir Matthew thew! If they mine, egad we'll
				countermine, and we start with a pretty tolerable advantage. You are a man of
				science, Sir Matthew Dowling; and I need not tell you, that a powerful movement once
				in action, is devilish hard to stop. The <hi>vis inertiæ</hi> will work for us, my
				friend — not to mention that when the animals find out their only alternative is
				labour or starvation — labour, such and so much as you in your bounty will be
				pleased to bestow — they will all grow as patient as so many sucking doves."</p>
			<p>These words were spoken as they slowly mounted together the steps of the stately
				portico; Sir Matthew, as a reply, shook his friend cordially by the hand, and
				leading the way to the cool and lofty library, ordered iced water and claret, to
				wash away the effect of their half-hour's visit to the factory.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER IX. </head>
			<p>SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING MISS BROTHERTON — A DEMONSTRATION OF NEIGHBOURLY
				FRIENDSHIP AND ANXIETY — THE WILFULNESS OF AN HEIRESS — A GLEAM OF LIGHT CAUGHT IN
				THE DARKNESS.</p>
			<p>
				The mansion of Miss Brotherton, at the distance of three miles from
				the town of Ashleigh, though less splendid in external appearance than that of Sir
				Matthew Dowling, was quite as elaborately elegant in its interior, and moreover,
				incomparably superior to it in every point in which taste was concerned. To this
				superb home we must now follow the young heiress, as circumstances will hereafter
				frequently blend her name with that of Michael Armstrong.</p>
			<p>The position of Mary Brotherton was a very singular one, and in many respects far
				from being fortunate. At the age of twenty-one years and eight months, she found
				herself, by the death of her mother, in the uncontrolled possession of two hundred
				thousand pounds. Her father, dead some six or seven years before, had been a
				manufacturer of the old apprentice-system school, and his fortune made long before
				the humane bill of Sir Robert Peel, the elder, had, in some degree, weakened the
				chains which bound thousands of friendless orphans to unmeasured and unmitigated
				drudgery. <ref target="#ENG18400N2">[2]</ref>
			</p>
			<p>But of all these circumstances, his daughter was totally and altogether ignorant.
				Educated, from a very early age, at a fashionable London boarding-school, she knew
				nothing concerning the neighbourhood of her home, but that its hills and valleys
				were deformed by tall chimneys and dirty smoke; and that none of the young ladies
				who paid her visits during the holidays, were at all like her school-fellows in
				London.</p>
			<p>Of course, the little lady soon learned to know that she was a person of great
				consequence; and at the age of fourteen, had most completely acquired all the airs
				and graces of a spoiled child. But the death of her father was a great advantage to
				her; as his only child, and the only heir of his immense wealth, he rather
				worshipped than loved her, and the attentions he paid her, seemed more like acts of
				homage than of affection. Had she not given herself airs, he would have been
				miserable; and had it been possible that any act of hers could bring upon her a
				reprimand, it would have been something indicating her belief, that she was formed
				of the same sort of materials as the wretches who toiled for him.</p>
			<p> Fortunately, however, she was fond of her mother, who, being <pb n="85"/> a great
				invalid, lived quietly in the midst of her splendour; and the holidays of her
				daughter were thus passed quietly too, which saved her from much early adulation.
				She had remained at school till nearly eighteen; and from that time, to the period
				of her mother's death, which happened about fifteen months before the opening of
				this narrative, she had led a life of great retirement, dividing her time between
				attendance in her sick mother's chamber, galloping about the country on horseback,
				and reading every book she could get hold of, good, bad, and indifferent. </p>
			<p>On first finding herself alone in her own great house, the poor girl wept bitterly.
				Her mother's increasing sufferings had long made her release from them an event to
				be ardently desired by the only being who loved her; but when at last it came, and
				she had herself to think of, and nobody else, there was something almost terrible in
				her utter loneliness. She was personally acquainted with very few in the
				neighbourhood, and felt no affection for any of them. Of relations, to the best of
				her knowledge and belief, she possessed not one in the world; and with all her
				advantages, for she had many, being young, pretty, talented, and rich, she would
				gladly have changed places during the first weeks of her dismal mourning, with any
				girl of her own age who had father, mother, brother, and sisters to love, and be
				loved by.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Gabberly was the nearest neighbour she had on one side, and Lady Clarissa
				Shrimpton on the other, and both these ladies had occasionally been admitted to see
				her mother till within a few days of her death. When, therefore, this long-expected
				event at length took place, they both thought themselves privileged to assume the
				freedom of intimate friends, and penetrate to the lone boudoir of the mournful
				heiress. Fortunate for her it was, that they did so; for though neither of them
				possessed any single quality of sufficient value to win and wear the esteem, or even
				the liking, of an acute, clearsighted observer, such as the half-spoiled heiress
				certainly was; it was better to hear the sound of almost any human voice uttering
				words of kindness, than to sit lonely and apart, and hear none; so that neither the
				twaddling larum of Mrs. Gabberly, nor the absurd affectation of Lady Clarissa were
				without their use.</p>
			<p>It might, however, have been somewhat dangerous to the moral development of the young
				lady's character, had she long continued to find her only relief from sorrow and
				solitude in the society of persons who could only amuse her by their absurdities.
				Almost the first time she exerted herself for the purpose of pursuing some of her
				ordinary occupations, she drew forth her drawing-box, and produced a caricature of
				Lady Clarissa reciting verses from the pen of Mr. Norval; and the first observations
				she committed to paper, were the result of a tolerably accurate counting of the
				number of times Mrs. Gabberly had uttered "Well now!" during her last visit.</p>
			<p> At length, the first dismal fortnight being over, Miss Brotherton appeared at
				church; and then the whole neighbourhood rushed in <pb n="86"/> to express their
				sympathy, till her very soul sickened under the cuckoo-note of sorrowless
				lamentation. Nevertheless, there was so much of real sadness in the spectacle of a
				young girl thus left utterly alone in the world, that despite the golden light her
				wealth threw around her, many among her herd of visiters might have felt more for
				her, perhaps, than she gave them credit for. But, unfortunately such persons are not
				those who make their "griefs and clamour roar" most audibly, so she knew nothing
				about it, if it were so, and thereby lost any advantage which her temper might have
				gained from emotions that soothe and soften. </p>
			<p>Instead of this, she had to undergo what she felt to be a very severe persecution,
				from the prodigiously active interest which Mrs. Gabberly took in her, and her
				concerns. As some of the singularities of Miss Brotherton's character, will
				eventually produce results of considerable importance to our hero, it may not be
				amiss to recount the particulars of a scene which took place in her boudoir exactly
				three weeks after the death of her mother.</p>
			<p>On the morning in question, Mrs. Gabberly had as usual made her way unannounced to
				the young lady's presence, by dint of that assumption of extreme intimacy in her
				manner of inquiring for her, which in this case, as in a multitude of others,
				succeeded in putting to the rout the protecting discretion of her servants.</p>
			<p>"Well now, dear child!" she exclaimed on entering; "how are you to-day? Upon my word,
				Mary, you are too pale. You know my dear, the <hi>palor</hi> , as we call it, is not
				natural to your complexion, and therefore the symptom must be attended to. Have you
				any camphor in the house, dear?"</p>
			<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Gabberly; but I want nothing of the kind."</p>
			<p>"Well now! then I must think of something else."</p>
			<p>"Not for me, ma'am, I shall not take any medicine whatever."</p>
			<p>"Dear child! How very odd that does seem to me! We people of science, Mary, are so
				used to turn to it upon all occasions, that it almost looks like losing one's wits
				altogether, to go on so, and take nothing."</p>
			<p>"People of no science, ma'am, do not require it."</p>
			<p>"Well now! so much the worse for them; but that was not the point I came to talk
				about. Do you know, my dear, I am perfectly miserable in my mind about you. I can't
				sleep at nights for thinking about the impossibility of your living on, all by your
				own self, in this great palace of a house."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton turned away her head, and resting her elbow on the mass of cushions
				that were piled beside her on the sofa, concealed her eyes with her hand, while her
				neighbour proceeded to discuss her condition.</p>
			<p>"Did you ever hear of such a thing in your whole life, my dear? No, never! that's
				quite certain. It is quite out of the question, and impossible; and to speak out the
				whole truth at once, it is not in any way decent."</p>
			<p>Something a little approaching to a start, produced a slight movement in Miss
				Brotherton. Mrs. Gabberly proceeded.</p>
			<pb n="87"/>
			<p>"Well now, my dear! I have been thinking that what you must do, is to find out among
				your friends and acquaintance, some respectable person in the situation of a
				gentlewoman to live with you. Somebody already known in the neighbourhood, would be
				the most desirable, because then you would not have the trouble of introducing her;
				for of course it will be in no wise proper for so young a person as you are to visit
				about, even in the country, without a proper chaperone."</p>
			<p>Again the cushions were slightly moved, but this time it was not a start, but a
				shudder which caused it.</p>
			<p>"Well now, my dear Mary!" resumed the friendly Mrs. Gabberly; "what do you think
				about it?"</p>
			<p>"It requires longer time than I have yet had, before I can answer your question, Mrs.
				Gabberly," replied the young lady.</p>
			<p>"Well now! that's very true, and very discreet, and sensible; and God forbid, my
				dear, that I should make you do any thing in a hurry. Only you must not forget that
				every body will be on the look out to observe what you do. Depend upon it, that they
				won't wait to make their remarks — that's all."</p>
			<p>The heiress retained her meditative position, but said nothing.</p>
			<p>"Don't you think what I have said is true, my dear?"</p>
			<p>Mary bowed her head, but without changing the position of the hand which concealed
				her face.</p>
			<p>"I wish she would look up at me," thought Mrs. Gabberly; "I might guess then,
				perhaps, if there was any chance for me."</p>
			<p>"It would be a comfort, as well as a protection, wouldn't it, my dear, to have a
				kind, affectionate friend, always near you!"</p>
			<p>Mary bowed again.</p>
			<p>"Well now! I wish you would open your dear heart, and speak out. Tell me, don't you
				feel very lonesome, when you sit down to dinner?"</p>
			<p>"I have been long used to that, Mrs. Gabberly."</p>
			<p>"Yes; but then you had not got to think all the time, as I am sure you must do now,
				that there was <hi>nobody</hi> near you; that there was <hi>nobody</hi> in the whole
				great house but your own self, besides the servants; that there was <hi>nobody</hi>
				to drink your health; <hi>nobody</hi> to say won't you take a little bit more, my
				dear? <hi>Nobody</hi> to say isn't this very nice? <hi>Nobody</hi> to give you a nod
				and a smile when you look up. <hi>Nobody</hi> to ask, 'Shall I peel an orange for
				you, my dear?' or, 'Shall I mix your strawberries and cream, my ove?' Now isn't this
				all dismal?"</p>
			<p>"Very dismal, ma'am!" replied the young lady in a voice that showed plainly enough,
				that the picture was not an indifferent one.</p>
			<p>"Well now! that's saying something; and I can't help thinking, dear Mary! I can't
				help saying, that it has come into my head, that if — "</p>
			<p> "Mrs. Gabberly!" cried Miss Brotherton, starting suddenly up. "I must now beg you to
				leave me. You have described my situation so forcibly, that I feel more than ever
				the necessity of making <pb n="88"/> some arrangement that may better it. But I will
				not do this without reflection. Leave me, now. I thank you for your kind concern,
				and when next you call upon me, you shall find that what you have said has not been
				disregarded." </p>
			<p>"Well now, that's all right, and I'll go directly. Shall it be to-morrow, dear, that
				I call again?"</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am, if you please, not till next Saturday."</p>
			<p>"Saturday? Why, my dear, this is only Monday — it is a great while for me to live in
				such suspense about you, dearest."</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am, not very long. Saturday it must be if you please; and I shall be happy if
				you will stay and dine here on that day."</p>
			<p>"Thank you, my dear. I shall like that very, <hi>very</hi> much indeed. And then we
				can talk every thing over, my dear Mary. God bless you, my love. Take care of
				yourself, dearest, till Saturday; and just let me say one word in your ear at
				parting. Remember, that there is nobody in the whole wide world that loves you as
				much as I do."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton submitted herself passively to the embrace which followed; and when
				the door closed after her affectionate neighbour, she stood, as it seemed,
				patiently, while her sharp, short, retreating footsteps were heard along the
				spacious corridor, and when they were heard no more she applied her hand to the
				bell. But something made her pause ere she rang it, and stepping to a window, that
				opened upon a balcony filled with skilfully-shaded exotics, she peeped forth from
				among them, till the active-moving little figure of Mrs. Gabberly trudging along the
				drive below, became visible, and then the heiress turned again to the bell-rope, and
				pulled it vigorously.</p>
			<p>"Tell nurse Tremlett — tell Mrs. Tremlett to be so kind as to come to me
				immediately," was the order given to the servant who answered it.</p>
			<p>After the interval of a few minutes, during which Miss Brotherton stood with her arm
				resting on the mantelpiece, with a countenance and attitude of deep meditation, the
				door opened again, and a pale, thin, little old woman entered, who, had not her
				wrinkles and gray locks betrayed her, might have passed for five-and-twenty, so
				active and nicely moulded was her little person. But despite her still clear and
				bright black eye, her face showed that she could not honestly count less than twice
				that sum of years.</p>
			<p>"Come in, dear nurse!" said Miss Brotherton kindly, "come in, and sit down by
				me."</p>
			<p>The old woman obeyed this command without further ceremony; and, by her manner of
				doing it, showed plainly that it was not an uncommon one.</p>
			<p>"What have you been about, my child?" said she, "you don't look well."</p>
			<p>"I dare say not," replied Mary abruptly, "I have been bored and plagued, nurse
				Tremlett; and now I am going to bore and plague you, in order to comfort
				myself."</p>
			<pb n="89"/>
			<p>For all answer, the chartered nurse put her arm round the young lady's neck, and gave
				her a very loving kiss.</p>
			<p>"Nay, it is very true, Mrs. Tremlett; and no joke in it. I do assure you. I am going
				to make a terrible change in your manner of life, my dear old woman. I am going to
				make a state-prisoner of you."</p>
			<p>"You may plague and puzzle your old nurse as much as you like, my darling, so you
				will but smile and look a little less dismal than you have done of late. And what is
				it you are going to do to me, Miss Mary? I dare say it is nothing that I shall think
				very hard."</p>
			<p>"I don't know that, Mrs. Tremlett," replied Mrs. Brotherton very gravely.</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Tremlett, and Mrs. Tremlett," said the old woman, looking earnestly at her,
				"what does that mean, Miss Mary? — I don't like it."</p>
			<p>"I know you won't like it. But you must bear that, and a great deal more, my dear old
				friend. You must make up your mind to lead a new life altogether; and I am very much
				afraid that you will not like the change."</p>
			<p>"Oh! goodness, Miss Mary, what is it you mean? You are not going to send me away from
				you are you?"</p>
			<p>"Is that the worst thing I could do to vex you?" said the young lady, very cordially
				returning the caress she had received; "you need not be afraid of that, at any rate.
				The misfortune I threaten is of quite a different kind."</p>
			<p>"Well, then I shan't mind it; let it be what it will. But I don't think it is any
				thing very bad, my dear; for you look as if you were ready to laugh, though you try
				to look grave, and talk of a misfortune."</p>
			<p>"It will be no misfortune to me, I assure you, but quite the contrary. I shall like
				it very much, and that is the reason you see me ready to smile; and if you will be a
				dear good woman, and make no difficulties about it, all will go well. Mrs. Gabberly
				has been here, nurse Tremlett; and she tells me that I must immediately take some
				elderly lady into the house, to sit with me and take care of me; because, as she
				says, I am too young to live alone, and that all the neighbourhood will be making
				remarks upon me."</p>
			<p>"Well, my dear, and I dare say she says no more than the truth. Your great fortune,
				and your prettiness, and all that, will certainly bring many and many an eye upon
				you, my dear child; and, of course, it won't do for you to go on without having some
				steady lady of a companion like, to be living with you."</p>
			<p>"But I hate all ladies that would come to live as a <hi>companion like</hi> ,"
				replied the young lady. "What should I do with a Miss Mogg, trotting about after me,
				to ask if I wanted my smelling-bottle, or my pug-dog? And that is not the worst that
				could happen to me either. As sure as you are there, nurse Tremlett, Mrs. Gabberly
				has made up her mind to come and live here as my companion herself!"</p>
			<pb n="90"/>
			<p>"And you would not like that, by your manner, my dear? I do think she is rather too
				bustling and busy for you. You are such a reader that you would not like any one
				that was over talkative and fidgety about you. But don't fret yourself for that,
				dear; you must make some civil sort of excuse to Mrs. Gabberly. You are clever
				enough to find one, I dare say."</p>
			<p>"Yes, nurse Tremlett, I think I am — I have found one already."</p>
			<p>"That's very right, Miss Mary; and what shall you say to her, my dear?"</p>
			<p>"I shall tell her that you are going to live with me as my companion."</p>
			<p>Nonsense, dear! That is the joke, is it, that you were looking so merry about?"</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Tremlett, I am not jesting in any way," replied Miss Brotherton, very gravely;
				"and I entreat you to listen to my proposal as seriously as I make it. I am
				friendless, very friendless, dear nurse; and trust me, with all my money, I am
				greatly to be pitied. Why, in addition to the misfortune of not having a relation in
				the world, should I be doomed to the misery of hiring a stranger to pester me with
				her presence from morning to night? It is a penance that I cannot, and will not
				endure. Yet I know that all people will say, that I ought not to sit up here alone
				to receive company, and I do not wish to be spoken of as a person who either knows
				not or values not propriety. But if you will do what I desire, Mrs. Tremlett, you
				may save me from this, and from what I perhaps should unhappily consider as a
				greater misfortune still, namely, the being forced to pass my life with a person
				whose presence was a pain to me."</p>
			<p>Tears flowed down the cheeks of the heiress as she spoke; and the devoted servant who
				sat beside her, though absolutely confounded by the strange proposal, could find no
				words to utter in opposition to it.</p>
			<p>"Dear nurse! — you will not forsake me, then?" said Mary, smiling through her tears.
				"There's a dear soul — you will let me have my own way in everything — about your
				dress, you know, and all that? It will be worth any thing in the world to see Mrs.
				Gabberly, when she first beholds you sitting up in state in the drawing-room!"</p>
			<p>From the moment the old woman had perceived that her beloved, but wilful darling, was
				not only serious, but sorrowful, and that, too, concerning no imaginary grief, but
				from the contemplation of the truly melancholy isolation of her condition, all
				disposition to resist her vanished; and yet nurse Tremlett was perfectly capable of
				perceiving all the inconveniences likely to arise on both sides from so strange a
				scheme. But even while such thoughts silently took possession of her, leaving
				perhaps some legible traces on her countenance, her young mistress looked so kindly
				and so coaxingly in her face, as if at once reading and deprecating all she had to
				say, that she felt nothing was left for her but obedience.</p>
			<p> "Do what you will with me, my dear," said she, with a fond <pb n="91"/> smile and a
				shake of the head, that seemed to say, "I know you must have your own way, Mary." </p>
			<p>And thus was conceived and established a mode of life for the pretty heiress, which
				left her as completely uncontrolled as to all she did, and all she said, as if nurse
				Tremlett still occupied her quarters in what was once called the nursery, but had
				since become the favoured nurse's sitting-room.</p>
			<p>Mary's delight in dressing and drilling the old woman for her new duties, was
				childish and excessive; and most triumphant was the satisfaction with which she
				perceived that rich black silks, and delicate white crape, performed their office
				upon her nice little person so effectually, as to give her quite as much the air of
				a gentlewoman, as the majority of those who were likely to meet her.</p>
			<p>So, on the following Saturday, Mrs. Gabberly found Miss Brotherton no longer the
				solitary occupant of her elegant boudoir, but with a remarkably well-dressed elderly
				lady, seated in the most luxurious of all the newly-invented chairs which decorated
				the apartment, with a small work-table before her; while on the footstool at her
				feet, sat the heiress, looking a vast deal more happy than she had ever before seen
				her.</p>
			<p>The mystification did not last long. The eyes of Mrs. Gabberly were of that happy
				fabric, which enables the owner to retain for ever the memory of every face they
				have ever looked upon; and it was with heightened colour, and no very sweet
				expression of countenance, that she exclaimed, "Soh! you have taken your old nurse,
				Tremlett, to sit with you?"</p>
			<p>"My nurse no longer, but my most kind friend, Mrs. Gabberly, who has affectionately
				consented to forsake many of her former comforts, in order to be useful to me. You
				will perceive, ma'am, that your advice has not been lost upon me."</p>
			<p>"Well now! that is a strange whim, Miss Brotherton. But of course, you are not
				serious in trying to make me believe that it is your intention to let nurse Tremlett
				assist you in receiving your company. If it be so, I think it but fair to tell you
				at once, as my experience is rather greater than yours, that not one single soul
				among all our rich folks, will care to visit you at all. I don't wish to affront
				you, nurse Tremlett; but you won't contradict what I say, I am quite sure of
				that."</p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett showed herself an apt scholar, for she bowed her head, went on with her
				knitting, and said nothing.</p>
			<p> If she was silent, however, Miss Brotherton was not. "Listen to me, ma'am, if you
				please, for a few minutes, while I explain to you my ideas on the subject; and
				having done so, I desire that it may never be alluded to again. I am left, Mrs.
				Gabberly, as I dare say you know — exceedingly well, in the possession of an ample
				fortune, with unlimited power to spend it as I please. Now I do not please to spend
				any part of it in putting myself under circumstances that I should feel annoying to
				me. For this reason I will not hire a gentlewoman — in all human probability of much
				higher birth than myself — to watch my caprices, and endure my whims. <pb n="92"/>
				If any one now in existence really loves me, it is Mrs. Tremlett; and I, too, most
				sincerely love her; therefore I flatter myself, that drawing tighter the tie that
				has long united us, will occasion pain to neither. If the obscure tradition I have
				heard respecting my grandfather be correct, he received much kindness when
				travelling the country as an itinerant tinker from Mrs. Tremlett's father, then a
				flourishing farmer in Yorkshire. So you perceive, Mrs. Gabberly, that I am really
				honoured by the association. But if any one should fancy the contrary — if any one
				should feel that the luxuries of my house and table — the only attractions I know
				of, by which I may hope to draw my neighbours round me — if any should feel that the
				value of these are lessened by the presence of Mrs. Tremlett, they must give them
				up. For the price I shall put upon my good dinners and fine balls, will be the most
				courteous and kind politeness to that dear and valued friend. And now that we have
				finally and for ever dismissed this subject, will you tell me if I may hope for the
				pleasure of your company at dinner to-day, Mrs. Gabberly?" </p>
			<p>From this period, Mrs. Tremlett never quitted Mary Brotherton, excepting when the
				heiress accommodated Lady Clarissa Shrimpton by the use of her carriage, when they
				were both going to visit at the same mansion: an arrangement which had often taken
				place during the late Mrs. Brotherton's lifetime, and which was of such very obvious
				mutual convenience, that one was rarely invited without the other.</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton by degrees recovered her natural high spirits, and though she not
				unfrequently felt the weight of great loneliness, she was rapidly learning to enjoy
				her independence. She read a great deal, though nobody knew any thing about it. She
				dearly loved flowers, and often assisted in their culture with her own hands,
				despite her half-dozen gardeners. She laid out whole miles of gravel walks in her
				own grounds with almost as much skill as went to form the Cretan labyrinth, in order
				that she might walk, and walk, and walk, without passing her own lodge-gates, and so
				running the risk of being called " <hi>imprudent</hi> " She still indulged herself,
				and with no sparing licence, in caricaturing her neighbours; and, if all the truth
				must be told, derived no small portion of amusement from the variety of modes she
				adopted to assure the almost innumerable pretenders to her hand, that it was not in
				her power to reward their valuable and flattering attachments.</p>
			<p>Such was Mary Brotherton's condition when she complied with Lady Clarissa Shrimpton's
				request, to drive over to Dowling Lodge the day after they had dined there. Upon
				this occasion, as upon many previous ones, the young lady, for lack of other
				amusement, occupied herself in selecting subjects for her merry pencil. The best
				excuse to be offered for her offences in this line is, that nobody but Mrs. Tremlett
				ever saw her saucy productions; so that assuredly they gave pain to no one — and
				when the heart is empty, and the head full, much allowance must be made for such
				freaks and fancies.</p>
			<p> While laying up stores of sketches from Sir Matthew, Lady Clarissa, <pb n="93"/> and
				the poet, her eye suddenly became fixed upon the beautiful child who had been
				brought in for general examination. Like most other ready limners of the human face,
				Miss Brotherton had considerable skill in physiognomy, and ere she had long gazed on
				the pretty, nicely-dressed, little boy, she felt persuaded that in spite of his gay
					<hi>habit de fête</hi> , the child was ill at ease, and under great discomfort. </p>
			<p>It is difficult for persons residing at a distance, and <hi>not</hi> "to the manner
				born," to conceive the extraordinary degree of ignorance in which the ladies of the
				great manufacturing families are brought up, as to real condition of the people
				employed in the concern from whence their wealth is derived.</p>
			<p>There is, however, a homely proverb that may help to explain this: "You should never
				speak of a rope in the house of a man that was hanged," and it is probably on the
				same principle, that no one speaks of the factory in the house of the manufacturer.
				Be this as it may, the fact is certain, and Mary Brotherton, like perhaps a hundred
				other rich young ladies, of the same class, grew up in total ignorance of the moans
				and the misery that lurked beneath the unsightly edifices, which she just knew were
				called the factories, but which were much too ugly in her picturesque eyes for her
				ever to look at them, when she could help it.</p>
			<p>Little did the kind-tempered, warm-hearted girl guess, that for hours before she
				raised her healthy and elastic frame from the couch where it had luxuriously reposed
				through the night, thousands of sickly, suffering, children were torn from their
				straw pallets, to commence a long unvaried day of painful toil, to fill the
				ever-craving purses, of which her own was one. She knew that Sir Matthew Dowling was
				considered as the richest man in the district — richer even than her father had
				been, and this was all she knew about him, except that her own sharp observation had
				enabled her to perceive that he was ignorant, vulgar, and most ludicrously crammed
				with pretensions of all sorts.</p>
			<p>After having looked into the face of little Michael, till she was perfectly convinced
				of his being exceedingly unhappy, she next directed her attention to his benefactor,
				as she heard him clamorously hailed on all sides; and his countenance, though
				smiling, spoke a language she liked not. It was evident to her that he was very
				keenly watching the boy, and more than once she detected a look from Sir Matthew,
				directed towards him, which was instantly followed by an attempt on the child's part
				to look less miserable.</p>
			<p>Then followed all the nonsense about Mr. Osmond Norval, and his promised drama, which
				was to place upon the scene some prodigiously generous action of Sir Matthew
				Dowling's, towards this little boy. Mary Brotherton did not believe a word of it,
				and sick of the false and fulsome flattery that was bandied about between the
				knight, the lady, and the poet, she made, as we have seen, a somewhat hasty
				retreat.</p>
			<p> On her road home she was more than usually silent, being occupied in a meditation on
				the features of Michael Armstrong. For <pb n="94"/> some time she suffered her
				ridiculous ladyship to run on in a violent strain of panegyric upon Sir Matthew, his
				talents, and his generosity, without offering any interruption, but at length it
				struck her, that fool as she was, Lady Clarissa might be able to tell her what she
				wanted to know; and therefore, after answering "Indeed!" to some tirade about Sir
				Matthew's great qualities, Mary ventured to come across the torrent of her
				ladyship's eloquence by saying, </p>
			<p>"Pray, Lady Clarissa, who is that little boy?"</p>
			<p>"Who, my dear? Good gracious, what an odd question! Is it possible you do not know he
				is a poor little factory-boy, that Sir Matthew has most benevolently taken out of
				that sad way of life, because he behaved so remarkably well about that cow, you
				know, my dear, last night?"</p>
			<p>"But why should you call it a sad way of life, Lady Clarissa? It is the way that all
				our poor people get their bread, you know."</p>
			<p>"Yes, I suppose so. But yet, my dear, you cannot but allow that it must be a very
				different way of life from what the little children lead whose parents, from father
				to son, for a dozen generations, have worked on the mains of one family. There can't
				be the same sort of family feeling and attachment, you know. However, I have not the
				least doubt in the world, that good Sir Matthew does his very best to make them
				comfortable."</p>
			<p>"Is this boy to live in Sir Matthew's family?"</p>
			<p>"I am not quite sure about that. I believe it depends in a great degree upon the
				manner in which the little fellow behaves; and so it ought, you know, my dear Miss
				Brotherton. I rather think Mr. Augustus was making himself too agreeable this
				morning for you to hear much of the story. However, the exquisite muse of our
				friend, Norval, will set the transaction before all the world in a proper point of
				view; and then you, like every body else, will be able to form your own judgment
				respecting the conduct of Sir Matthew."</p>
			<p>Again, Mary sunk into a revery concerning the respective countenances of Sir Matthew
				and the little factory-boy; but feeling quite sure that she should obtain none of
				the information she was burning with impatience to acquire, from Lady Clarissa, the
				remaining part of the drive was passed entirely in silence on her part, excepting
				that when Lady Clarissa asked her if she did not intend to take a part in the
				theatrical performances about to be brought out at Dowling Lodge, she replied, "No,
				certainly Lady Clarissa Shrimpton, I do not."</p>

			<p>MORE WILFULNESS ON THE PART OF THE HEIRESS — PRIVATE THE-ATRICALS — FAILURE OF A
				YOUNG PERFORMER, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES — PHILOSOPHICAL BREAKFAST-TABLE — A MORNING'S
				EXCURSION.</p>
			<p>
				No sooner did Miss Brotherton enter the room where she had left her
				old friend, who was still tranquilly enjoying the perfumed air which visited her
				through the open window as she sat knitting before it, than throwing her bonnet on
				one side, she began to examine, and cross-examine her as follows:</p>
			<p>"Pray, Mrs. Tremlett, do you know any thing about the factory people that work in all
				these great ugly buildings round about Ashleigh?"</p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett looked up at her for a moment before she replied, and then said, "I
				know very little about them, Miss Mary, — not much more than you do, I believe."</p>
			<p>"I have just been thinking, Mrs. Tremlett, how exceedingly wrong it is that I should
				be so profoundly ignorant on the subject."</p>
			<p>"Wrong? — I don't see any thing wrong, my dear, in your not knowing what you was
				never told."</p>
			<p>"I have been wrong in never wishing to be told; but, in truth, I have never thought
				upon the subject, and I have been very wrong in this. That silly body, Lady,
				Clarissa, said a few words to-day, which — quite unlike the usual effect of what she
				utters, made a great impression upon me. Speaking of the children who work in these
				factories, nurse Tremlett, she said theirs was a very different way of life from
				that of the children whose parents, from father to son, have worked for a dozen
				generations on the lands of the same family. There could not be the same sort of
				family feeling and attachment, she said. But why should there not, Mrs. Tremlett?
				These people work on, I dare say, from generation to generation, and yet, God help
				them, poor souls! — from the hour of my birth to the present day, I am never heard
				any body talk of attachment to them. Can you explain this difference to me? I do not
				at all understand it; but I am quite certain it cannot be right. Why do not we know
				something about our poor people, as the people with landed estates do about
				theirs?"</p>
			<p>"Upon my word, my dear, you have asked me a question not over and above easy to
				answer — that is to say, as to its being right. But it is easy enough too, in
				another way, for I may say plain and and straight, without any fear of blundering,
				that the thing is impossible."</p>
			<p>"What thing is impossible, Mrs. Tremlett?"</p>
			<p>"Why that the factory people should be noticed by the gentle-folks, and treated in
				the same way as labourers that work the land."</p>
			<pb n="96"/>
			<p>"You are too wise a woman, Mrs. Tremlett," replied Mary, "to assert so positively,
				what you did not know to be true; therefore I will take it for granted, that it is
				impossible for people working in a factory to be treated in the same way as people
				working on a farm. And now, seeing, God help me! that I am most frightfully
				ignorant, I must beg you to tell me what it is that causes this extraordinary
				dissimilarity between the different classes of the labouring poor?"</p>
			<p>"My dear child, it would hardly be decent to enter into all the reasons. Country
				folks, that is the field-labourers I mean, are just as likely to be good and
				virtuous, as their betters, and so they are for every thing that I have ever seen to
				the contrary. But it is altogether a different thing with the factory people. By
				what I can hear, for of course I never went among them, they are about the worst set
				of creatures that burden God's earth. The men are vicious, and the women desolate,
				taking drams often, and often when they ought to buy food; and so horridly dirty and
				unthrifty that it is a common saying, you may know a factory-girl as far as you can
				see her. So I leave you to judge, Miss Mary, whether such ladies as visit the
				cottages of the poor peasantry, could have any thing to say to such as these."</p>
			<p>Mary uttered no reply, but sat for many minutes with eyes steadfastly fixed upon the
				carpet. At length she raised them again to the face of her companion, and said, "It
				is then among such people as these, that children, almost babies — for such is the
				one I have just seen — are often employed?"</p>
			<p>"Often, my dear? They are always employed with them. And there's no particular
				hardship in that you know, because these very men and women are the parents of the
				children, and so they could not be separated any how."</p>
			<p>"What a dreadful class of human beings, then, must these factory people form! Is it
				not considered as a great misfortune, Mrs. Tremlett, to the whole country?"</p>
			<p>"Why as to that, my dear Miss Mary, there's many will tell you that it is the finest
				thing in the world for the places where the great factories are established, because
				they give employment to so many thousands of men, women, and even the very smallest
				children that can stand, almost. But you must not ask me, my dear, what I think
				about that, for of course I am no fair judge at all. I, that spent my childhood in
				playing among the hairbells, raking up little cooks of hay for the hardest work I
				was put to, and going to school to read, write, and sew, like the child of decent
				Christian parents in a civilized country — I can hardly pass fair judgment on goings
				on so very different. But I have heard, my dear, for I believe these things are
				talked of more in the servants' halls than among the great manufacturers themselves,
				especially when the ladies are by, — I have heard that a great many of the learned
				gentlemen in parliament say, that the whole system is a blessing to the
				country."</p>
			<p>"Then your account of it must be a very false one, nurse Tremlett," said the young
				heiress severely.</p>
			<pb n="97"/>
			<p>"I only speak after much that I have heard, and a little that I have seen," replied
				the old woman meekly. "However, my dear, dear Miss Brotherton," she added, "if you
				will take an old servant's advice, who loves you very dearly, you will just make up
				your mind, neither to talk, nor to think any more upon the subject. I am quite sure
				that it will give you no pleasure, and it does not seem possible to me that you
				should do any good; for you know, my dear, that you have nothing at all to do with
				any of the factories now, any more than Lady Clarissa herself. Will you promise to
				take my advice, my dear child, and think no more about it?"</p>
			<p>"On the contrary, Mrs. Tremlett," replied the young lady; "I am perfectly determined
				that for some time to come I will think of nothing else."</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p> Mary Brotherton kept her word. During the whole time that the Dowling Lodge
				theatricals were in preparation, while every other young heart in the neighbourhood,
				male or female, was eagerly anticipating the <hi>fête</hi> , hers was fixed
				steadfast and immoveable upon the mysterious subject that had seized upon it. That
				man was born to labour, that he was condemned to live by the sweat of his brow, she
				knew from high authority; and though under the social compacts which civilization
				has led to, some portion of every race have found the means of performing the
				allotted task vicariously, she felt not called upon to say that the arrangement was
				a bad one. It was by no means difficult to conceive why it was so, nor why of
				necessity it ever must be so. She felt, as all must do, who reflect on the subject,
				that if all distinctions were by some accident suddenly removed, and the entire
				organization of society to begin <hi>de novo</hi> , each man standing precisely on
				the same level as his neighbour, the earth would not complete one revolution round
				the sun, ere the equality would be violated. "Strength will be lord of imbecility."
				And when nature made one man more active, more intelligent, or more powerful of
				frame than another, she made the law in which originated inequality of condition.
				That, as time rolled on, and mankind became bound together nation by nation,
				substituting the conventional distinctions of civilized society for those derived
				from individual strength, — that when this happened, occasional anomalies should
				appear in the arrangement, seemed inevitable, and of necessity to be ensured. That
				it was inevitable, she conceived to be pretty nearly proved by the fact that no
				single authentic record makes mention of a nation in which hereditary distinction of
				some kind or other did not exist. Nor did it seem desirable that when the prowess,
				the wit, the wisdom, or the toil of an individual had endowed him with wealth beyond
				his fellows, he should be denied the dear privilege of endowing withal the children
				he loved, instead of leaving it at his death to be struggled for, and borne away by
				the most crafty or the most strong. All this, Mary Brotherton, in her little wisdom
				of twenty-two years and a half, <pb n="98"/> could without difficulty reason upon
				and understand. But that among those whom fate or fortune had doomed to labour, some
				should be cherished, valued, honoured by the masters who received and paid their
				industry, while "other some" were doomed, under the same compact of labour and
				payment, to the scorn, avoidance, and contempt of the beings whose wealth and
				greatness proceeded from their toil, was an enigma she could in no wise comprehend. </p>
			<p>"There must be something wrong," argued the young girl, as day by day she paced her
				gravel walks in solitary meditation; "there must be something deeply, radically
				wrong in a system that leads to such results. I may perhaps be silly enough to look
				with something approaching envy at the noble who traces his thirty descents unbroken
				from the venerable ancestor, whose valour won in a hard-fought field the distinction
				he still bears on his armorial coat, yet when I look round upon what the industry of
				my father — the only one of his race whose name I ever heard — when I contemplate
				what one man's industry can bequeath to his child, I feel that there is no very
				substantial cause for complaining of hereditary inferiority of condition. Nay, were
				I one of the peasants of whom the Lady Clarissa and nurse Tremlett speak, I can well
				enough believe that I might live and die contented with a life of healthful and
				respected toil. But to exist in the condition of these outcast labourers — to be
				thrust out, as it were, beyond the pale that surrounds and protects society — to
				live like the wretch, smitten by the witches' curse, 'a man forbid,' must be hard to
				bear. Children, young creatures still wearing the stamp of heaven fresh upon their
				brows, are, as it seems, amongst these wretched ones. I will find out why this is
				so, or be worried to death by Sir Matthew Dowling and his fellow great ones in the
				attempt."</p>
			<p>Towards the end of the month which preceded the grand display expected at Dowling
				Lodge, Mr. Osmond Norval requested permission to submit his composition to Miss
				Brotherton's perusal; a compliment she graciously consented to receive, being
				desirous, before she witnessed its performance, of learning all she could respecting
				Sir Matthew's rather mysterious adoption of the factory-boy, and also of the poor
				child's equally mysterious sufferings under the benevolent process that was
				performing on him.</p>
			<p>The little drama, therefore, which for obvious classical reasons the poet denominated
				"A Masque," reached her hands enveloped in delicately-scented paper. But all she
				learned thereby was, that Mr. Norval had thought proper to entitle it, "Gratitude
				and Goodness," or, "The Romance of Dowling Lodge," and to prelude it by a sonnet to
				be spoken by himself as prologue, in which a modest allusion was made to Milton's
				composition of Comus for the use of the Bridge-water family. She had, moreover, the
				gratification of discovering in what order Sir Matthew, Lady Clarissa, the poet, the
				governess, most of the young Dowlings, and little Michael himself were to appear
				upon the scene, and then she returned the young gentleman's MS. with a very honest
				assurance that she doubted not the composition would most satisfactorily answer
				every purpose for which it was intended.</p>
			<pb n="99"/>
			<p>Absurd as the whole business appeared to her, she resolved to be present at the
				representation; and having perceived, in her study of the exists and entrances, that
				no part was allotted to the homely Martha, she determined to place herself near her
				during the performance, in the hope of eliciting the information she was so anxious
				to obtain.</p>
			<p>On many occasions Miss Brotherton had remarked that this young lady either kept
				herself, or was kept very much apart from the rest of the family, which circumstance
				had been quite sufficient to propitiate her kindness, for most cordially did Mary
				Brotherton dislike the whole Dowling race. But so deep-seated was the feeling of
				poor Martha herself that nobody did, or could wish, to converse with her, that the
				hand-shakings and smiles of the heiress had never suggested to her the idea that she
				might wish to be better acquainted. This shyness had hitherto effectually kept them
				apart; but no sooner did Mary perceive that the neglected girl was the only one of
				the family, above the age of a mere baby, to whom no part in Mr. Norval's drama was
				allotted, than she resolved to profit by the circumstance, and, if possible, get
				from her such a commentary upon the piece, as might enable her to comprehend its
				plot and underplot.</p>
			<p>Accordingly, when the great night of representation arrived, Miss Brotherton reached
				the Lodge somewhat before the hour named in the invitation, and finding, as she
				expected, the room where the company were to be received, unoccupied, she desired
				one of the liveried attendants to send Miss Martha Dowling's maid to her. A female
				servant soon appeared. "Are you Miss Martha's maid?" said the young lady.</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear no, ma'am, I am Miss Dowling's and Miss Harriet's maid. Miss Martha never
				wants a lady's maid at all; but I can take any message from you, ma'am, that you may
				please to send."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton took one of her own cards, and wrote upon it with a pencil — "Dear
				Miss Martha, if you are not going to act in the play, will you have the kindness to
				come to me."</p>
			<p>This note the <hi>soubrette</hi> , as in duty bound, first showed to her own young
				ladies.</p>
			<p>"Good gracious! How very odd! What can Miss Brotherton have to say to Martha? Martha!
				of all people in the world. She is not ill, Crompton, is she?" said Miss
				Arabella.</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear no, ma'am — at least she don't look so. She seemed in a great hurry,
				however, for me to take the card."</p>
			<p>"Well, take it then," cried Miss Harriet, impatiently, "and make haste, or I shall
				never get my ringlets done: they take such a time. Do give her the card, Arabella.
				What good is there in spelling it over a dozen times? I dare say she only wants to
				cross-question her about Augustus, and what he's going to act. So take the card,
				Crompton, and run with it to Martha as fast as you can."</p>
			<p> Crompton and the card found Martha sitting still undressed in the obscure little
				room allotted to her in the children's wing. She was deep in the pages of a new
				romance, and being, if possible, more <pb n="100"/> certain than usual that her
				presence would not be wanted, had made up her mind to enjoy herself till the time
				arrived for the commencement of the play, when it was her purpose to join the large
				party invited, in their progress from the drawing-room to the theatre. </p>
			<p>On receiving Miss Brotherton's card, however, she hastily resumed the business of her
				toilet; for though the summons was as unintelligible to her as to her sisters, she
				felt, at least, an equal desire that it should be civilly complied with. It never
				took long to make poor Martha as smart as she ever thought it necessary to be, and
				in a very few minutes she joined Miss Brotherton in the drawing-room.</p>
			<p>"This is very kind of you, Miss Martha. I hope I have not hurried you?" said the
				heiress, taking her hand so kindly, that the shy girl could not but feel encouraged
				to speak to her with rather more confidence than usual.</p>
			<p>"Why are you not going to take a part?" was the next question.</p>
			<p>"I take a part! Oh! Miss Brotherton what should I make of acting?" said Martha,
				laughing and blushing, in reply.</p>
			<p>"Nay I think you are very right, Martha. I assure you nothing could have persuaded me
				to have made the attempt. But I thought that if you did not play, you would perhaps
				have the kindness to take charge of me, and let me sit by you; for unless I have
				somebody to tell me what it all means I shall be horribly puzzled."</p>
			<p>"I will tell you every thing I can," replied Martha, good-humouredly. "But I don't
				think I understand much about it myself."</p>
			<p>"What sort of a little boy is it that your papa has been so kind to? Every body is
				talking about it, and Lady Clarissa says there is something quite sublime in what he
				is going to do for him. But I suppose Sir Matthew must have remarked some qualities
				particularly amiable and good in the child, or he would not distinguish him so
				remarkably from all others of the same class."</p>
			<p>"You have heard the story of his saving Lady Clarissa Shrimpton from the cow that was
				going to toss her, have you not, Miss Brotherton?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, my dear, I heard all that, you know, the morning I was here; — though, by the
				by, you were not in the room, I remember. But there must be something more in it
				than that. Do tell me all you know."</p>
			<p>"Indeed I don't know any thing more," said Martha.</p>
			<p>"What sort of a child is it?"</p>
			<p>"A very nice little fellow indeed, and I think if I had been papa I should have done
				the same thing myself."</p>
			<p>"Really! Then you do think this child is something out of the common way, I suppose?
				Pray tell me, dear Martha, will you, if you hear much about the people that work in
				the factories? and the children in particular?"</p>
			<p>"No, indeed, Miss Brotherton, I know nothing in the world about them; except that I
				sometimes hear papa say that they are all very idle and ungrateful," replied
				Martha.</p>
			<pb n="101"/>
			<p>"I have been told that they are a very wretched set of people. But, perhaps, they
				cannot help it, Martha?" returned Mary,</p>
			<p>"I do not know how that can be, Miss Brotherton; every body can help being idle, and
				every body can help being ungrateful, I should think."</p>
			<p>"But it seems that they all live together, and make one another worse; and, in that
				case, the children are very much to be pitied; for, poor little things, they cannot
				help themselves. What makes you think this little boy is a nice child? Have you ever
				talked to him much?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, a good deal; but papa has been taking him about to a great many houses; and
				besides, he has been occupied very much in learning his part, for Duo, who was
				teaching him, said that he could hardly read at all. So I have been trying to help
				him, and he is very quick. But I like him, too, because he appears so fond of his
				mother and brother. He cares for nothing that can be given him, unless he can take
				some of it to them."</p>
			<p>"And does your papa let him do so?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! yes, every day."</p>
			<p>"That <hi>is</hi> very kind. Then I suppose the little fellow is superlatively
				happy?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," replied Martha, with a slight shake of the head.</p>
			<p>"It is very strange if he be not," observed Miss Brotherton. "If he were kept from
				his mother I could easily understand that he might be very miserable,
				notwithstanding the great good luck that has befallen him; but if he is permitted to
				see her constantly, I can't imagine what he can want more."</p>
			<p>"I don't know," again replied Martha.</p>
			<p>The expected guests began now rapidly to assemble, and refreshments were handed round
				previous to their being conducted to the room prepared for the evening's amusement.
				"Don't forsake me, dear Martha!" whispered Miss Brotherton, "I am not very intimate
				with any of these ladies and gentlemen, and I shall not enjoy the evening's
				amusement, unless I am seated next you."</p>
			<p>Martha felt a good deal surprised at the compliment, but readily agreed to the
				proposal; and in a few minutes, Lady Dowling, who was any thing rather than pleased
				by the whole affair, gave the assembled party to understand that the time fixed for
				their entering the theatre had arrived.</p>
			<p>On tiptoe with curiosity, and eager beyond measure, to see what Lady Clarissa
				Shrimpton, Mr. Osmond Norval, and "all the Dowlings" would look like on the stage,
				the numerous company almost ran over one another in the vehement zeal with which
				they prepared to obey her.</p>
			<p> Of course no expense had been spared in fitting up the apartment allotted to the
				purpose, in form and style as like as might be to a theatre; and, thanks to the
				taste and ingenuity of the little French governess, the thing had been not only
				expensively, but well done. The space railed in for the orchestra very conveniently
				divided the <pb n="102"/> company from the actors; and, when the curtain drew up,
				the well-lighted stage exhibited just such a carpeted, draperied, mirrored, and
				flower-adorned arena, as well-dressed amateur ladies and gentlemen delighted to
				appear in. </p>
			<p>The very sight of the stage elicited a shout of applause; and when Mr. Osmond Norval,
				habited at all points according to the most accredited draped portraits of Apollo,
				came forth from behind the sky-blue silken hangings which formed the
					<hi>coulisses</hi> , all the ladies began clapping till their little palms and
				fingers tingled with the unwonted exercise.</p>
			<p>The young poet certainly looked very handsome; and not the less so because he knew
				that besides Miss Brotherton's eyes, which he was certain must be fixed upon him
				(though he could not distinguish her in the obscure corner in which she had chosen
				to place herself beside Martha), those of Miss Arabella and Miss Harriet Dowling
				(both estimated at twenty thousand pounds), were fixed upon him too. Not to mention
				the speaking orbs of Lady Clarissa Shrimpton, whose nobility, he had little doubt,
				might be won to smile upon and endow him with all the little earthly goods she had,
				could he make up his mind to believe that he could do no better.</p>
			<p>All this flattered, excited, and inspired him most becomingly; and as he stood with
				one silken leg slightly advanced, and so firmly planted as to require only the toe
				of its fellow to support him from behind, with a lyre suspended round his neck, and
				a wreath of bay-leaves mixing with the dark curls upon his brow, at least two dozen
				young ladies in the manufacturing interest declared to their secret souls that they
				never could hope to see another like him.</p>
			<p>Having first recited the pretty sonnet before mentioned, in which he modestly hinted
				at more points of resemblance than one between himself and Milton, he suddenly
				changed his hand, and having, as he expressed it to Lady Clarissa, "gleaned with the
				hand of a master," he spoke the following lines, which in the copies printed for
				private circulation, were headed</p>
		
			<label>"SHAKSPERIAN PROLOGUE.</label> <l>"Open your ears! For which of you will stop </l><l>The seat
			of hearing, when loud rumour speaks? </l><l>I, from the orient to the drooping west, </l><l>Making the
			wind my post-horse, will unfold </l><l>The act performed by virtuous Dowling here. </l><l>Oh! for a
			muse of fire that should ascend </l><l>The brightest heaven of discription! </l><l>Then should the
			noble Dowling, like himself </l><l>Assume the form of mercy; and, at his heels, </l><l>Leashed in like
			hounds, should famine, pain, and labour, </l><l>Crouch, all subdued!" &amp;c. &amp;c. </l><p> The
				applause which followed this lasted so long, that the performers began to fear there
				would not be time enough left for the piece. But <pb n="103"/> by degrees the tumult
				subsided, Apollo was permitted to retire, and the business of the scene began. </p>
			<p>There was something more nearly approaching a balance of power at Dowling Lodge than
				is often to be found in the domestic arrangements of gentlemen and their wives —
				for, though it may be a very doubtful point, whether man or wife most frequently get
				the mastery, it but rarely happens that the matter long remains unsettled. At
				Dowling Lodge, however, there was a beautiful alternation of power, which the
				measured movement of the engine in their factories, first sending up one side, and
				then the other, might, perhaps, have suggested. If matters came to a downright
				quarrel, however, Sir Matthew was sure to be the conqueror; for her ladyship got
				frightened, and gave in: but when any differences of opinion arose on points of no
				great importance, the lady's murmurings and mutterings were equally sure to be
				victorious, and Sir Matthew let her have her way, merely because, like the
				organ-grinder, "he knew the wally of peace and quiet."</p>
			<p>On the subject of the private theatricals, there was, most decidedly, a difference of
				opinion between the heads of the Dowling family, and some rough skirmishing might
				have ensued, had not Mademoiselle Beaujoie hinted to her good friend, Sir Matthew,
				that if they could introduce a scene or two, where all the dear little children
				could be shown off, Lady Dowling's objections would probably give way. The
				experiment was made, and answered completely; on condition, that "Gratitude and
				Goodness" should open and close with scenes in which the whole family should appear
				in fancy dresses, and be grouped by the dancing-master in the most graceful
				attitudes he could invent, Lady Dowling withdrew her opposition. As soon, therefore,
				as Apollo had retired from the front of the stage, no less than sixteen male and
				female Dowlings rushed forth from the silken hangings, and formed themselves, after
				some little confusion, into a <hi>tableau</hi> , declared, on all sides, to be of
				unrivalled beauty. Again bravoes and clapping of hands announced the delight of the
				spectators; and, when this was calmed, some very pompous verses gave notice that
				this display of youthful grace and beauty, was on occasion of a rustic fête, in
				which the <hi>dramatis personæ</hi> were to amuse themselves <hi>al fresco</hi> .
				Then entered the Lady Clarissa; but, for some good reason or other, it had been
				decided, between the knight and herself, that she should enter alone: and from a
				most poetical scream of terror, soon uttered by her ladyship, it became evident that
				a dragon, or a cow, or some other dreadful animal had been pursuing her. Again and
				again, with most picturesque effect, she looked behind her towards the blue silk
					<hi>coulisses</hi> , from whence she had issued, till, at length, the feelings
				of the audience were worked up to a wonderful pitch, by her ejaculating — "It comes!
				It comes!" </p>
			<p> This was little Michael's cue; and, as soon as the words were spoken, he entered
				from the opposite side, holding a ragged cap on <pb n="104"/> high, and dressed, in
				all respects, precisely as he had been on the memorable night of Lady Clarissa's
				vaccine adventure. </p>
			<p>In dumb show the lady indicated the direction from whence the dreaded monster would
				approach; and the most energetic and unsparing action of the limbs and person
				secured the audience, as well as her deliverer, from any possible mistake on the
				subject. Michael, too, performed his part with great spirit, exaggerating, as he had
				been commanded, by every possible means, the manævres necessary for turning the
				front of a cow.</p>
			<p>To this scene, too, the audience gave loud applause, and in the midst of it entered
				Sir Matthew, who was, of course, greeted by bravoes, "long drawn out," till the
				ladies and gentlemen having nearly deafened one another, ceased at last, and
				listened to the beautiful explanation which followed.</p>
			<p>First the company were made to comprehend that the danger was over, for the
				well-taught Michael turned about, and manfully facing the audience, pronounced
				distinctly "The beast is gone!" Then Sir Matthew, after bowing respectfully to the
				lady, said, "Permit me, madam, to express my joy, That you've been saved by this
				good little boy." It was, however, uttered in an accent of such temperate and
				measured feeling, that not even Lady Dowling saw any thing very particular in it. A
				precaution by the way, which had been suggested by the gentlemen during the frequent
				rehearsals.</p>
			<p>Lady Clarissa's acting then became animated indeed; for the poet, following her
				instructions, had composed for her in smooth, yet startling rhymes, about thirty
				lines of the most fervent thanksgiving, in which, now laying one hand on the head of
				the ragged child, now clasping both together in the eagerness of her address to Sir
				Matthew, and now gracefully extending both arms towards the audience, as if to make
				them sharers in her generous emotions, she produced an effect more easily imagined
				than described.</p>
			<p>The speech which followed from Sir Matthew was very noble, and at once let the
				audience into all the secret purposes of his benevolent heart. The by-play of
				Michael during this scene had been prepared for by his benefactor with particular
				care, but somehow or other the boy was not apt in catching the knight's idea; for
				instead of the tender but joyous smile with which he had been instructed to look up
				into the face of his munificent patron, his countenance expressed nothing but
				terror.</p>
			<p>"That little fellow does not look happy, Martha," whispered Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Oh no! he looks very frightened," replied Martha, "but that is very natural, is it
				not, considering the novelty of his situation?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," said the heiress.</p>
			<pb n="105"/>
			<p>The piece went on to exhibit the beautiful manner in which this adoption of a ragged
				factory-boy into the bosom of the Dowling family had been hailed by all of them as
				an especial grace from heaven, on account of the opportunity it afforded for
				relieving the overflowing generosity of their hearts. Sir Matthew, while looking
				round upon his sixteen full-dressed offspring, who were now again skilfully grouped
				upon the stage, was made to exclaim with clasped hands, and an almost sobbing excess
				of emotion, "The widow and the orphan are more dear, To their young hearts, than
				million pounds a year!" </p>
			<p>Every body was touched, and again the applause was deafening.</p>
			<p>Then came a very striking scene indeed. Michael appeared superbly dressed, and on
				each side of him was a middling-sized Miss Dowling, holding lightly and gracefully
				each a little basket, from under the covers of which peeped out grapes and peaches
				on the one side, and something that had the semblance of a flask of wine on the
				other.</p>
			<p>Then spoke the fair-haired Louisa.</p> <l>"Dear little boy, this basket's all your own,
			</l><l>'Tis to reward the courage you have shown."</l> <p>And then Miss Charlotte.</p> <l>"So is this
			too, my pretty little boy, </l><l>We hope 'twill give your poor old mother joy." </l><p>And when
				Michael, having received a basket in each hand, appeared preparing to depart, the
				two young ladies exclaimed together, "'Tis papa sends it, who's so very kind, How to
				do good, is all he seeks to find!" </p>
			<p>Upon this, Michael turned round again towards the audience, and stood stock still. It
				was quite evident that he had some speech to make which he had apparently forgotten,
				for it was impossible for any child to look more completely distressed and at a
				loss.</p>
			<p>At length it became pretty evident that, in lieu of all other performance, the poor
				boy was going to cry; and some ingenious persons doubted whether it might not be in
				his part to do so; but this idea was speedily removed by the very matter-of-fact
				pokes and nudges which the two young ladies bestowed upon him. In addition to this
				it seemed as if the little fellow caught some stimulating sounds from the
					<hi>coulisses</hi> , for he cast more than one furtive glance in that direction,
				and at length, with what was evidently a great effort, he stammered out, "My
				mother's dear, and so's my brother too, But dearer still are your papa and you. His
				charity's so great, his heart so good, He gives the naked clothes; the hungry food;
				And I for — one — will, — day — and night — in prayer, Ask blessings — for — him —
				and — his — worth declare." </p>
			<pb n="106"/>
			<p>The two last lines were so completely choked by the tears, which all his efforts
				could not suffice to restrain, that they were perfectly unintelligible to the
				audience.</p>
			<p>"Is all that vehemence of weeping a part of Mr. Norval's composition?" inquired Miss
				Brotherton in a whisper to Martha.</p>
			<p>"Upon my word I don't know: but I should think not," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"Martha!" said the heiress, very earnestly, "that child is suffering from an agony of
				terror."</p>
			<p>"I should hope not," said Martha, in a voice that somewhat faltered.</p>
			<p>"Do you know any thing about this boy?" pursued Miss Brotherton, continuing her
				whispering. "Do you know any thing about the mother he talks of?"</p>
			<p>"Nothing whatever, Miss Brotherton."</p>
			<p>"Do you feel quite satisfied, my dear, that this romantic adventure has been, or will
				be, advantageous to him?"</p>
			<p>"I think," replied Martha, "that one can hardly doubt his being better off here than
				in the poverty of his mother's dwelling. You saw, Miss Brotherton, what a ragged
				condition the clothes were in which he had worn before."</p>
			<p>"Decent clothes are a comfort, my dear Martha, there can be no doubt of it; but
				compared with the other circumstances which influence the happiness of life, they
				are of no great importance. Of course I suppose that your father means to educate
				him. Do you know whether he can read his bible yet?"</p>
			<p>"I know that he could not," replied Martha, "when he came here."</p>
			<p>"Poor little wretch! That is very terrible neglect somewhere. What sort of person is
				the mother?"</p>
			<p>"By Michael's account," replied Martha, smiling, "she is a very estimable person
				indeed; but it certainly seems that she has not taken much pains with his education,
				poor little fellow!"</p>
			<p>"What a sad thing it is," continued Miss Brotherton, "that we all of us know so
				little of the poor people employed in the factories! I believe they are said to be
				exceedingly well paid, but still I don't think it is quite right for the rich people
				in a neighbourhood to take no notice whatever of the poor. I know it is not so in
				other places; for I have heard my schoolfellows continually talk of their fathers'
				tenants and work-people, and of their schools, and their clothing societies, and all
				sorts of things, and I have been trying to do a little good just at home with the
				families of some of the work-people about the place. But I have just now got my head
				strangely full of these factory folks. I wish you could give me some information
				about them, Martha."</p>
			<p> "Indeed, my dear Miss Brotherton, I know as little as you do. I am told that they
				are very good-for-nothing, that they receive enormous sums annually in wages, and
				yet that they are never contented, but for ever complaining, just because they have
				work to do for what they <pb n="107"/> get, and yet papa says that it is the very
				prettiest lightest work in the world. And indeed I am afraid it is but too true, for
				this little fellow, though he is so interesting and intelligent that it is
				impossible to help liking him, always speaks of the factory as if he hated it." </p>
			<p>"And if he does hate it, Martha, why, if you question him should he conceal it?"</p>
			<p>"But I never have questioned him about that; I should not think it right to do so.
				Only I remember his making me laugh, just after he came here, by saying something
				exceedingly <hi>naïve</hi> about their all liking wages but not work. Now, though I
				am not very deep in political economy, it is impossible not to see that poor people
				must work for what they get — don't you think so?"</p>
			<p>"Assuredly, and rich people too. I have no doubt that both your father and my father
				had to work very hard for the fortunes which have rewarded their industry. In our
				class of life this is necessary. But that does not settle the question that is
				working in my head at present, and which, to tell you the truth, will not let me
				sleep by night nor amuse myself by day. How comes it that ALL the people — the only
				phrases I have heard upon the subject were very comprehensive — how comes it, Martha
				Dowling, that ALL the people, young and old, who work in the factories are classed
				as ignorant and depraved?"</p>
			<p>"My dear Miss Brotherton, how is it possible that I should be able to answer
				you?"</p>
			<p>"Have you not heard the same statement, Martha?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, yes! very often. I know mamma says that nothing in the world should induce her
				to take a girl who had worked in the factories into the house, even in the very
				lowest situation. Oh! I believe they are very bad!"</p>
			<p>"Very bad? But, good gracious! why are they very bad? What is the cause of this
				strange degradation of one peculiar class of human beings? It surely cannot arise
				from the nature of their employment; for if it did, of course the clergy of the
				neighbourhood would interfere to stop it. It is quite out of the question to suppose
				that in a Christian country many hundreds — nay thousands — Mrs. Tremlett tells me
				there are many thousands employed in the factories — it is impossible to suppose, is
				it not, that any labour or occupation could be permitted, which by its nature, and
				of necessity, tended to corrupt the morals of those employed in it? There must be
				some other cause for their wickedness, if wicked they are."</p>
			<p>"Oh! they <hi>are</hi> very wicked, I am quite sure of that; for I have heard it
				again and again ever since I was born, and you know I have not been away like you,
				Miss Brotherton, always in London. I have never lived any where but here, and I
				never remember the time when I did not hear that the factory people were the very
				wickedest set of wretches in the world."</p>
			<p> For a few minutes Miss Brotherton was silent, and even seemed to have restored her
				attention to the silly business of the gaudy stage, for her eyes were fixed in that
				direction; but she presently gave evidence that wherever her eyes had been, her
				thought had not wandered <pb n="108"/> from the subject to which she appeared so
				earnestly to have devoted them. For she said in the low, slow, even tone, which
				denotes concentrated feeling — </p>
			<p>"If this be so, Miss Martha Dowling, if thousands of human beings in a Christian
				country are stigmatized as wicked, because their destiny has placed them in a
				peculiar employment, that employment ought to be swept for ever and for ever from
				the land, though the wealth that flowed from it outweighed the treasures of
				Mexico."</p>
			<p>Martha Dowling started, but said not a word in reply; there was something in the
				manner of her neighbour which awed her. True, genuine, deep feeling, is always
				sublime, be it manifested by such a young girl as Mary Brotherton, or such an old
				king as Lear. But, though Martha was silent, her companion suffered not the
				conversation to drop; and presently resumed in a tone of less exaltation, — "Do you
				think, my dear, that I could get hold of your little Michael some day, so that I
				might have a little conversation with him?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, certainly, Miss Brotherton," replied Martha, "I think papa would be quite
				pleased, for he seems to like nothing better than seeing every body take notice of
				him."</p>
			<p>"Do you think your father loves the little boy, Martha?"</p>
			<p>"I am sure he is very kind to him," replied the conscious daughter a little piqued.
				"For it can be nothing but kindness that makes him take the child into the house,
				and feed him and clothe him for nothing."</p>
			<p>"And, of course, Martha, he will get some instruction here?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! he has begun to read the bible already," replied the kind-hearted girl, eagerly.
				"I have undertaken that business myself. The poor little fellow seemed to suffer so,
				when he was learning his part. I never saw a child appear so heartily ashamed of any
				thing."</p>
			<p>"One almost wonders at that too; brought up, as he must have been, in the very lap of
				ignorance. I should have thought, after all I have heard, that he would have been
				ashamed of nothing. However, I should like to talk to him. At what hour do you give
				him his reading lesson, Martha?"</p>
			<p>"When I can catch him," replied the young lady, laughing. You have no idea, Miss
				Brotherton, how much the little gentleman is engaged. Papa has taken him about with
				him in the carriage, almost every where, and such quantities of people have been to
				see him!"</p>
			<p>"And does he seem greatly delighted with it all?"</p>
			<p>"No, I don't think he does. He seems to me to care for nothing in the world but his
				mother, and a little crippled brother that he talks of."</p>
			<p>"That does not look as if he were thoroughly confirmed in wickedness as yet,"
				observed the heiress.</p>
			<p>"No, indeed! It is his affectionate temper that has made me take to him; for I do
				believe he is very idle, and hates his work, just as papa says they all do,"
				answered Martha.</p>
			<p>"Does he visit his mother every day?"</p>
			<p> "He either goes or sends to her, I believe. Papa makes a great point of something
				very nice being taken down to Ashleigh every day <pb n="109"/> for Michael's sick
				mother to eat; and the child always carries it himself, when papa does not send him
				elsewhere." </p>
			<p>"And at what hour does he generally go?"</p>
			<p>"Always after luncheon."</p>
			<p>"Don't you think the play must be almost come to an end, Martha?" said Miss
				Brotherton, after looking again on the stage for a few minutes, and yawning rather
				more conspicuously than politeness could warrant.</p>
			<p>"I should think it must," replied Martha, catching, and returning the yawn.</p>
			<p>There was, however, a good deal to be done. There was a figure dance to be performed,
				and a trio to be played on the pianoforte, harp, and violoncello, by the two eldest
				Miss Dowlings, and their music-master.</p>
			<p>This last was a very long business: and the heiress, who, instead of having been
				instructed to endure annoyances patiently, had been rather taught never to endure
				them at all, got up in the middle of it, and telling Martha that her head ached too
				much to permit her remaining any longer, made her way out of the room, which she
				effected the more easily from having taken her station near a side door, which led
				from the theatre (in ordinary phrase, the school-room) into the private apartments
				of Mademoiselle Beaujoie.</p>
			<p>Martha Dowling, of course, followed her, and expressed much concern for her malady,
				offering all the specifics usually suggested by one lady to another, under such
				circumstances. "No, thank you," was the reply she received to all, "I only want to
				get away."</p>
			<p>"But it will not be very easy to do so, this way," replied Martha, "unless you will
				condescend to go through the passage that leads from the offices."</p>
			<p>"Never fear, dear Martha," returned the self-willed young lady, "I will condescend to
				go through any passage that will lead to fresh air, for indeed that place was too
				hot!"</p>
			<p>The room they first entered on passing through the door, was one dedicated to the
				reception of globes, slates, guitars, dumb bells, dictionaries, embroidering-frames,
				and sundry other miscellanies connected with an enlarged system of education. Beyond
				this was the bedchamber of Mademoiselle, which again led to an apartment opening
				upon that part of the school-room now occupied as the stage. This room, which was
				denominated Mademoiselle Beaujoie's parlour, was now converted into a general
				green-room and dressing-room, for into this, all exits from the stage were made.</p>
			<p>While still in the bedroom, Miss Brotherton, and her more than half-frightened
				companion, heard voices speaking in no very pleasant accents from this theatrical
				retreat, and the angry tones of Sir Matthew Dowling himself were soon unmistakably
				audible.</p>
			<p>"Let us go back, pray let us go back!" said the greatly distressed Martha, in a
				whisper.</p>
			<p> "I am too ill, my dear, to bear that room again," rewhispered Miss Brotherton. "Let
				me sit down here for a few minutes, and I shall <pb n="110"/> recover myself; and
				then we can return, and go out the other way with the rest of the company." </p>
			<p>It was impossible to argue the point; so poor Martha submitted, though cruelly
				distressed at the idea of her father's private violence of temper being listened to
				by one of those who had never seen Dowling Lodge, or its inhabitants, excepting in
				full dress. This distress was by no means lessened when some very audible words made
				it evident that Michael Armstrong was the object of the angry feelings to which he
				was now giving vent. As the best thing to be done under the circumstances; she
				pointed to a sofa at the greatest distance from the imperfectly-closed door from
				whence the sounds issued; but Miss Brotherton had already dropped into a chair so
				near this door of communication that she not only heard, but saw all that was
				passing in that part of the green-room which Sir Matthew Dowling occupied. That this
				was the last place in which a gentlewoman would have been likely to place herself at
				such a moment, is most certain; but the capricious heiress was wont to exclaim on
				many occasions, when observance and restraint were irksome to her, "I am not a
				gentlewoman — and why should I torment myself by affecting to be one."</p>
			<p>It was probably by some such reasoning that she now justified to herself the strong
				measure she was adopting; in order to become acquainted with what was passing
					<hi>behind the scenes</hi> respecting Michael Armstrong.</p>
			<p>Circumstances were favourable to the object; for Sir Matthew was in one of those
				towering fits of passion, to which his family and dependants knew him to be subject,
				though the majority of the world declared him to be an extremely good-natured
				man.</p>
			<p>"Blackguard! — Vermin! — Devil's imp!" — were among the first intelligible words
				which reached the heiress, after she had seated herself; and these were accompanied
				by cuffs so heavy on the head and shoulders of Michael, that it required a very
				powerful effort over herself to prevent her darting forward to seize the arm that
				gave them. But this prudent effort was dictated and sustained by a stronger feeling
				than curiosity; and she remained perfectly still to await what should follow.</p>
			<p>Dr. Crockley, who, though not among the corps of performers, had been permitted to be
				useful behind the scenes in a variety of ways, and among the rest had acted as
				prompter, stood beside the trembling child, and it was to his friendly ear that the
				irritated Sir Matthew addressed himself.</p>
			<p> "Will you believe he did not do it on purpose? Will you believe Crockley, that there
				was any thing to make him cry then? Had we not borne with all his beastly stupidity,
				expressly for the purpose of keeping the little ungrateful monster in good humour?
				Hadn't I fed him, and crammed him, as you bid me, with what was too good for him
				ever to have reached the smell of? Didn't I cosset his lazy beast of a mother with
				such niceties as the dirty beggar never heard of before? And his crook-shanked rat
				of a brother, too, haven't they been all fed at my cost for more than a month past?
				And then to see this <pb n="111"/> black-hearted traitor come upon the stage, and
				cry before all the company as if his heart was breaking?" </p>
			<p>"It's too bad to bear," replied Dr. Crockley, "and if he was to be flayed alive and
				salted, it would not be half what he deserved."</p>
			<p>"Wouldn't the best thing I could do be to send him back into the factory to-morrow
				morning, Doctor?" demanded Sir Matthew, suddenly quitting his hold of the child, and
				setting his square arms akimbo. "By the living God! I am sick of the job."</p>
			<p>"I will be very good, sir, if you will," said the boy, "and I won't go to sleep at
				the work at all, and no more won't Edward neither, if you will but please to let me
				go back again."</p>
			<p>"You see how much he dreads the factory," said Sir Matthew, with a grim smile. "But,"
				nodding his head, and winking his eye familiarly to the child, "we shall see, my
				pretty dear, if Mr. Parsons can't contrive to do something more than just keep you
				awake. He <hi>shall</hi> go back, Crockley, upon my soul he shall. It is the only
				way to prevent his driving me mad. I loathe the very sight of him."</p>
			<p>"You must do as you like, Sir Matthew," replied his confidential friend, "but it will
				be the most d — d foolish thing you ever contrived in your life, if you do. I tell
				you the story is doing wonders every where; and now, because a stupid brat can't say
				his lesson perfect, you are just going to spoil it all."</p>
			<p>"His lesson perfect! Confound the sly vagabond, that was not the point, Crockley. It
				was not the <hi>lesson</hi> that choked him. How much will you bet me that if I get
				fifty lines written down abusing me and nothing else in 'em, he won't learn them off
				as glib and perfect as any actor on the stage? I know his black heart, and he shall
				find out that mine is not made of pap before I have done with him."</p>
			<p>"That's all right and fair enough, and I have nothing to say against it," replied the
				friendly physician, "and let us talk it all over quietly together to-morrow morning;
				but for to-night — " And here Dr. Crockley taking his friend by the arm led him to
				the door which opened upon the stage, from whence issued a <hi>tintamarre</hi> of
				instruments sufficient to cover whatever he might wish to say, not only from the ear
				of little Michael, but from all others. The moment selected by the angry knight for
				relieving himself of the wrath which burned within him would have been a most
				favourable one, but for the accidental vicinity of Miss Brotherton. While the whole
				corps of performers, excepting the manufacturer and the factory-boy, were grouped
				upon the stage, in a style the most favourable for the display of their persons and
				dresses, the trio above mentioned augmented, by way of finale, by tambourines and
				triangles, went steadily on in a <hi>crescendo</hi> movement that ended in a clamour
				rendered perfect by the last peal of applause from the wellnigh worn-out audience,
				so that their secret conference was not otherwise likely to be overheard.</p>
			<p> At the moment after Sir Matthew had declared his intention of teaching Michael to
				know what his heart was made of, and just as he was himself led off by his friend
				Crockley, Miss Brotherton, pressing her two hands strongly upon her breast,
				involuntarily pronounced the <pb n="112"/> word " Monster !" and
				then placing her hands before here eyes remained lost in no very pleasing revery.
				But hardly had her meditations lasted a moment, ere they were chased by hearing the
				sound of some one falling near her, and looking round, she perceived poor Martha
				stretched insensible upon the floor. </p>
			<p>Inexpressibly shocked at remembering, which she did by no slow action of the mind,
				the suffering to which her own unscrupulous curiosity had exposed the unfortunate
				girl, she ran to her with eager haste, and with much repentant tenderness raised her
				head and did all her small experience suggested towards restoring her. The
				comfortable insensibility did not last long; and Martha, who with restored animation
				immediately recovered her recollection, and in whose composition no affectation of
				any kind had part, raised herself without assistance from the ground, and silently
				placed herself upon a sofa.</p>
			<p>"Dear excellent Martha!" exclaimed Miss Brotherton, with much true feeling, "fear not
				that I should ever repeat what I have so accidentally heard; and let not your good
				and dutiful nature suffer thus, because I <hi>have</hi> heard it. We have all our
				faults, Martha, and it is the duty of each to pray for the conversion of their own
				hearts first, and then for the repentance of others. And what prayers, dear girl, so
				likely to be heard, as those of a good and dutiful child? Let us slip back to our
				places, Martha. This clapping of hands announces, as I take it, the conclusion of
				the piece."</p>
			<p>Martha, though wounded to the very soul, uttered no word of deprecation or complaint;
				but there was an unsophisticated simplicity of character about her which made her
				decline, by a courtesy that had a little of the stiffness of ceremony in it, the
				offered arm of Mary, and stepping forward she opened the door by which they had left
				the theatre, till the heiress had passed through it, and resumed her place.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XI. </head>
			<p>MISS BROTHERTON PUSHES HER INQUIRIES FURTHER — A WELL-ARRANGED SCHEME DISAGREEABLY
				DEFEATED — A VISIT, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</p>
			<p>
				Mary Brotherton certainly did not return home that night with any
				doubts on her mind respecting the nature of Sir Matthew Dowling's benevolence; but
				the fever of spirits which had seized her was greatly increased by the information
				she had gained.</p>
			<p> There was a vast deal of energy and strength of purpose in the mind of Mary
				Brotherton, but hitherto all this had lain latent and <pb n="113"/> inert. The
				sentiment which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred is the first to awaken the
				female heart to strong emotion seemed to be totally powerless to her. She had never
				yet felt the slightest approach to the passion of love; nor was it very likely she
				should, for one among her many peculiarities of character was the persuasion that
				every man who paid her attention was in pursuit of her fortune, an idea, which to
				such a temper as hers was calculated to act as a sevenfold shield against all
				amatory attacks upon her heart. </p>
			<p>Most truly therefore, up to this time, had she continued "In maiden meditation, fancy
				free." But this could be said no longer; neither fancy nor any other faculty could
				be termed free in one whose thoughts fixed themselves by night and day upon one
				single subject, while feeling that to it she was ready to sacrifice every thing else
				in life.</p>
			<p>On re-entering her house on the memorable night of the Dowling Lodge theatricals,
				Miss Brotherton retired to her apartment without even the intention of sleeping. She
				laid her head upon her pillow deliberately determined not to close her eyes in sleep
				till she had made up her mind as to the best way of rescuing the pale trembling
				child, whose voice and form haunted her, from the horrible bondage of Sir Matthew
				Dowling's charity.</p>
			<p>The question was not altogether an easy one. She could hardly doubt that very strong
				indignation would follow any open effort on her part to interfere with a child
				publicly held up as the favoured object of Sir Matthew's loudly-vaunted benevolence,
				and moreover, privately marked out by his vindictive nature as a victim to his
				hatred.</p>
			<p>Whether as a rival in his munificence, or a champion against his hate, it was pretty
				certain that her interference would render her obnoxious to her pompous neighbour's
				displeasure, and this she had no inclination to encounter if she could help it. For
				though at this moment she felt within her a strength and firmness of purpose not
				easily shaken, the poor girl knew that she stood alone in the world, with no friend
				to support her more powerful than nurse Tremlett, and nothing but her two hundred
				thousand pounds' worth of this world's trumpery to enable her to have her way, and
				her will, in many matters that she feared might turn out rather difficult to
				manage.</p>
			<p>So she determined to avoid quarrelling with Sir Matthew Dowling as long as she could,
				and though the image of Michael struggling with his tears, and the plaintive sound
				of his voice as he pleaded for leave to labour again, absolutely haunted her memory,
				she determined upon being cautious, wise, and very deliberative in any measures she
				might eventually take to ensure his release.</p>
			<p> Under the influence of these prudential resolutions, Miss Brotherton for the present
				abandoned her purpose of seeking a conversation with the child himself, and
				determined to find her way to the cottage of his mother instead. Yet even this she
				felt must be done with caution. Her carriage and her liveries were about as splendid
					<pb n="114"/> and conspicuous as carriage and liveries could be, and though she
				knew not precisely in what direction the widow Armstrong might be found, it was easy
				enough to guess that did she make use of her ordinary mode of conveyance in reaching
				her abode, let it be where it might, she would attract more attention than she
				desired. </p>
			<p>It was to Mrs. Tremlett that she determined to apply in this dilemma, and at their
					<hi>tête-à-tête</hi> breakfast on the following morning, she once more led the
				conversation to the factories.</p>
			<p>"You must not scold me, dear friend," said she, "if you find that I have, as I told
				you I would, disobeyed your advice altogether, about thinking no more of the factory
				people, for I cannot get them out of my head, nurse Tremlett."</p>
			<p>"I am sorry for it, my dear," replied the good woman, gravely; "because I am quite
				sure that you will only vex yourself, and do no good."</p>
			<p>"You ought to know me better by this time, Mrs. Tremlett, than to fancy that your
				manner of speaking on this dark subject is the way to check my curiosity. It was
				pretty effectually awakened perhaps before; but had it been otherwise, what you say
				would be quite enough to set me upon inquiring into it. Nurse Tremlett, I WILL know
				every thing that the most persevering inquiry can teach me respecting the people to
				whose labours all the rich people in this neighbourhood owe their wealth, and myself
				among the rest. And when I tell you that at the present moment this is the only
				subject upon which I feel any real interest, I think you are too wise to attempt
				turning me from it, by saying, 'My dear you will only vex yourself.'"</p>
			<p>"I do indeed, my child, know you too well to fancy that if you have set your mind
				upon it, you will give it up; so I have nothing more to say, Miss Mary."</p>
			<p>"Well then, my dear woman," replied Mary, taking her hand, "if, through all the years
				we have passed together, I have shown such a determined spirit for no reason in the
				world but only to get my own wanton silly will, do me the justice to anticipate that
				I shall not be less obstinate in this one thing, that I believe to be right, than in
				all the many wherein it was most likely I suspected myself to be wrong. I do
				believe, nurse Tremlett, that it is my duty to understand this matter better than I
				do; and if this be so, I will trust to God to make up to me for all the
					<hi>vexation</hi> your prophecy threatens it will bring."</p>
			<p>"If that is the way you think of it, my dear child, Heaven forbid that I should seek
				to hinder you. But rich as you are, dear Mary, if you was to give it all, and ten
				thousand times as much besides, what good could it do? The mills would go on just
				the same you know."</p>
			<p> "I don't want to stop the mills, nurse Tremlett. Why should I? Industry, ingenuity,
				science, enterprise, must of course be all brought into action by this flourishing
				cotton-trade, and, beyond all doubt, it would be equally wicked and wild to wish its
				destruction. That is not the notion I have got hold of, good nurse, very, very far
				from it, I assure you. What I want to find out is whether, by the nature of things,
				it is impossible to manufacture worsted and cotton wool into <pb n="115"/> articles
				useful to man, without rendering those employed upon it unfit to associate with the
				rest of their fellow-creatures? This seems to me so gross an absurdity that I cannot
				give faith to it, and therefore I suspect that the depravity and wickedness you and
				Miss Martha Dowling talk about, must arise from these people having too much money
				at their command. This, perhaps, may lead to intemperance and extravagance. Don't
				you think this may be the case, Mrs. Tremlett?" </p>
			<p>"Good gracious, no, Miss Mary! Why they are all the very poorest starving wretches
				upon earth."</p>
			<p>"But they may be poor because they are extravagant, nurse. They must get a most
				monstrous quantity of money, for though none of the gentlemen ever talk much of
				their factories, I have repeatedly heard allusion made to the enormous sums paid
				every week to the work-people. And it is quite clear that all the families must get
				a great deal, because all the little children work, which can hardly be the case
				elsewhere. Now, I cannot help thinking, nurse, that a great deal of good might be
				done by teaching them a little economy, and inducing them to lay by their
				superfluous money in a savings-bank. That is one great reason why I want to get
				acquainted with the people themselves. Now, for instance, that poor sick widow
				Armstrong — the mother of the little boy that Sir Matthew Dowling has taken; I am
				quite sure that she can have no wickedness to hurt me — and I am determined, nurse,
				to go and call upon her."</p>
			<p>"Well, my dear, that can't do no great harm, certainly; and, if you like it, I can go
				in the carriage with you."</p>
			<p>"Most certainly I should like you to go with me, but not in the carriage, Mrs.
				Tremlett. I don't want to have all the people in her neighbourhood staring at me, or
				at her either; and that they would be sure to do if we went in the carriage. I mean
				to walk, nurse."</p>
			<p>"Do you know where the woman lives, my dear?"</p>
			<p>"No; I must leave you to find that out."</p>
			<p>"What is her name, Miss Mary?"</p>
			<p>"Armstrong. She is a widow, and lives somewhere in Ashleigh. Let us walk into the
				garden, and while I am looking after my seedlings, you can inquire of one of the
				under-gardeners, or the boy. And if you manage the matter well, the next prime
				blossom that I get from my experiment-bed, shall be called the Tremlett
				geranium."</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p>While this conversation was going on at Millford Park, the residence of Miss
				Brotherton, Dr. Crockley arrived to enjoy a <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> breakfast with Sir
				Matthew in " <hi>the study</hi> " at Dowling Lodge. This room, though not so
				splendid as some of its neighbours under the same roof, could, nevertheless, be made
				very snug and comfortable upon occasion, and an excellent breakfast was spread
				before them; while the two gentlemen sat in judgment upon little Michael's
				contumacy, and consulted on the best method of bringing him into better order.</p>
			<p> "Confound the imp!" exclaimed Sir Matthew, as he selected his <pb n="116"/>
				favourite dainties, "is it not provoking, Crockley, that I should have taken such an
				aversion to him? Upon my soul, I never hated any thing so much in my life. In the
				first place it is disgusting to see him dressed up, walking about the house like a
				tame monkey, when I know that his long fingers might be piercing thousands of
				threads for two shillings a week; and it is neither more nor less than loathsome to
				see him eat, at luncheon, sometimes when we have had him in before company, exactly
				the very same things that my children eat themselves; and then upon the back of it
				all, to know that the ungrateful little viper hates the very sight of me. I don't
				believe, Crockley, that any good can come of all this, equal to what it makes me
				suffer in the doing. It is perfectly unnatural to see him close within an inch of my
				own legs. I'd rather have a tame toad crawling about by half. I must give it up,
				Crockley — I must, upon my soul." </p>
			<p>"You are the master, Sir Matthew. I can't stop you, if do it you will; but I can tell
				you this, I have been calling at fifty different houses, at the very least,' since
				this job began, and I pledge you my sacred honour that in every one of them the only
				thing talked of was your benevolence and generosity. 'Such an example!' cried one;
				'So heavenly-minded!' said another; 'It is enough to bring a blessing upon the whole
				country,' whined a third; and, 'It is to be hoped that such goodness will be
				rewarded in this world and the next,' observed a fourth. Think, Sir Matthew, how all
				this will tell against the grumblings about Miss Nance Stephens and her sudden
				demise."</p>
			<p>"That's true — devilish true, Crockley — and yet it's no cure for my being sick at
				the stomach every time I see him."</p>
			<p>"I don't know about that; I should think it was, or, at any rate, if you'll only bear
				it a little longer I should not be at all surprised if you were to be relieved by
				some other great capitalist setting up in the same way, and as your name has been
				sung out, that would do just as well. Upon my soul, I'm in earnest; I should not the
				least wonder if, before the end of three months, every one of your first-rates were
				to have a tame factory-child in their houses, to act like the hedgehogs we get to
				eat black-beetles for us. And they'd do their work well too, Sir Matthew: all the
				nasty, creeping, multiplying plagues, in the shape of evil tales against the factory
				system, would be swallowed up by the clearing-off effects of these nice little
				hedgehog gentry."</p>
			<p>"You are as keen as your own lancet, Crockley; and I never turn a deaf ear to any
				thing you say. But it's monstrous hard though, that I can't walk about my own house
				without running the risk of seeing this odious little grub. By the way, Crockley,
				why could not my lady take a factory-girl in by way of charity? Some of the little
				wenches are sightly enough before they have worked down their flesh too far; and,
				though I can't say I am particularly tender over the lanky idiot looking slatterns
				that we mostly get at the mill, I'll bet what you please that I should never hate
				the sight of a girl, as I do the sight of this boy."</p>
			<p> "Very likely not, Sir Matthew," replied the doctor, laughing immoderately. <pb n="117"/> "But what would my lady say? And what would all the other ladies say?
				No, no, leave that alone, and make up your mind to let the boy have the run of the
				house for a month or two; after which you may send him to the devil if you will; for
				the good will be done, and the boy himself forgotten." </p>
			<p>"That's all vastly easy for you to lay down, chapter and verse, wise man that you
				are," replied the knight. "But if I tell all, I can let you into a secret, Crockley,
				that would make you change your mind, perhaps. The long and the short of it is, that
				I can't keep my hands off him, and if the young black-hearted scamp — I know he is
				black-hearted, I'm quite sure of it on account of a look he has got with his eyes,
				that makes one always feel so uncomfortable — if he were to take it into his vile
				ungrateful head to go about the country telling every thing that I may have happened
				to say and do to him, when his nasty ways have pushed me further than I could bear,
				I don't think the history of the charity job <hi>would</hi> do much good,
				doctor."</p>
			<p>Doctor Crockley gave a long low whistle; and then, after a minute's meditation, said,
				"That's a bore."</p>
			<p>"I know it is," sharply responded his patron, "a devilish bore. But you don't suppose
				that I am to stand bursting with rage, and not take the liberty of speaking my mind
				to a factory grub, do you?"</p>
			<p>"Heaven forbid! A whole factory full of wenches may all drop down dead, I hope,
				before it comes to that," replied his friend. "But what you have stated is worth
				attention, Sir Matthew. I don't like the notion of that child's having tales to
				tell. It spoils all."</p>
			<p>"I know it," returned the vexed knight. "Martha told me just now, not ten minutes
				before you came, that Miss Brotherton said she should like very much to talk to the
				boy: she is as sharp as a needle, you know, and I'll answer for it would find out
				all he has got to tell, and a devilish deal more, perhaps, in no time. Pretty work
				that would make! would it not? Augustus is sure of her, he tells me; and just fancy
				such a match as that spoiled by the forked tongue of this little viper! The very
				notion makes one mad."</p>
			<p>"A cure must be found for that mischief, let it cost what it may," replied Crockley;
				"and for the future it might be better, perhaps, for your charity, Sir Matthew, to
				show itself some other way. You are too honest-hearted, that's the fact. A fine bold
				intellect, like yours, can't descend to the paltry patience belonging to inferior
				minds. Is there no getting rid of the boy? No possibility of sending him 'prentice
				some where or other?"</p>
			<p> "'Prentice?" said Sir Matthew, looking with a very singular expression into the face
				of his friend. "Prentice?" he repeated, and stretching out his hand, he seized upon
				that of Doctor Crockley, which he shook with extraordinary ardour. "Send him as a
				'prentice! Upon my soul, Crockley, if you had laid down five hundred pounds upon the
				table, I should not have considered it as of one half as much worth as that one word
				'PRENTICE. Yes, by Jove! he shall be a 'prentice. Oaf that I was for not thinking of
				it before! You don't know half the good you have done me by <pb n="118"/> that word.
				'Tis but lately, my dear fellow, that you and I have come to understand one another
				thoroughly; and I have never yet talked to you about one or two points particularly
				interesting to all our capitalists. I never mentioned to you, did I, the Deep Valley
				Mills, not far from Appledown Cross, in Derbyshire?" </p>
			<p>"Never, Sir Matthew, as far as I can recollect," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"Well, then, I will tell you something about them now, that will make you perceive
				plainly enough what a capital good hit you have made in talking of apprenticeship
				for my young darling. Deep Valley Mill, Crockley, is the property of my excellent
				friend Elgood Sharpton. He is one of the men born to be the making of this country.
				A fine, manly, dauntless character, who would scorn to give up his notions before
				any act of parliament that ever was made. His idea is, Crockley, — and I should like
				to see the man who would venture to tell me that it was not a glorious one, — his
				idea is, that if we could get rid of our cursed Corn-laws, the whole of the British
				dominions would soon be turned into one noble collection of workshops. I wish you
				could hear him talk; upon my soul, it's the finest thing I know. He says that if his
				system is carried out into full action, as I trust it will be one of these days, all
				the grass left in England will be the parks and paddocks of the capitalists.
				Sharpton will prove to you as clearly as that two and two make four, that the best
				thing for the country would be to scour it from end to end of those confounded idle
				drones, the landed gentry. They must go sooner or later, he says, if the corn-laws
				are done away with. Then down goes the price of bread, and down goes the operative's
				wages; and what will stop us then, doctor? Don't you see? Isn't it plain as the nose
				on your face that when the agricultural interest is fairly drummed out of the field,
				the day's our own? Who shall we have then spying after us to find out how many hours
				a day we choose to make our hands work? D'ye see, Crockley? If we choose to work the
				vitals out of them, who shall say we shan't?"</p>
			<p>"I never heard a finer, clearer line of argument, in my life, Sir Matthew," replied
				the attentive listener. "That man, that Elgood Sharpton, seems born for a
				legislator. But I question not that when you two get together you act like flint and
				steel upon one another. Is not that the case?"</p>
			<p> "Pretty much I believe," replied Sir Matthew; "and I promise you, Crockley, I give
				no bad proof of my confidence in your honour and friendship, by letting you into a
				few of our notions, for matters are by no means quite ripe for us to speak out, as
				yet. Our policy is, you must know, to give out that it is the operatives who are
				clamouring for the repeal of the corn-laws, whereas many among them, saucy rogues,
				are as deep as their betters, and know perfectly well, and be hanged to 'em, that
				our only reason for trying to make ' <hi>down with the corn-laws</hi> ,' the popular
				cry is, that we may whisper in their ears, 'down with the wages' afterwards. Ay,
				doctor, if we can but manage this England will become the paradise of manufacturers!
				— the great workshop of the world! When strangers climb our chalk cliffs to get <pb n="119"/> a peep at us, they shall see, land at what point they will, the
				glowing fires that keep our engines going, illuminating the land from one extremity
				of the island to the other! Then think how we shall suck in — that is we the
				capitalists, my man — think how we shall suck in gold, gold, gold, from all sides.
				The idea is perfectly magnificent! The fat Flemings must give up all hopes of ever
				getting their finical flax to vie with our cotton again! — Crockley," but here Sir
				Matthew paused for a moment, as if half doubtful whether he should go on. The
				confidential impulse within him, however, worked so strongly in favour of the
				friendly smiling physician, that all reserve grave way, and winking his eye at him
				with a truly comic expression, he proceeded — "Crockley, they don't understand
				spinning in Flanders: they don't know yet how many baby sinews must be dragged, and
				drawn out to mix as it were with the thread, before the work can be made to answer.
				No, no, we have fairly given Master Fleming the go by in his own trade, so for the
				future he must just be pleased to go on hand-digging, and sewing every inch of his
				dung-muxen, till it teems with corns for exportation. That's what he's fit for;
				whereas science has put us rather in advance of all that, my good doctor. Our
				friends in Poland, too, shall plough away to the same tune, and Russia, from end to
				end, will become one huge granary at our service. Where will your aristocratic
				landholders be then, Crockley? Perhaps you can't tell? but I suspect I can. They'll
				just be in the factories, sir. Your manors and your preserves (we can get game
				enough from abroad), your manors and your preserves will be covered with factories,
				except just here and there, you know, where we capitalists may have taken a fancy to
				my Lord This-thing's grounds, or the Duke of T'other-thing's mansion, for our own
				residences. And this I maintain is just as it should be; and the reason why, is
				plain. We have got before all the world in machinery, and so all the world must be
				content to walk behind us. By Jove, if I had my way, Crockley, I'd turn France and
				the Rhine into a wine-cellar, Russia into a corn-bin, and America, glorious America,
				north, south, east, and west, into a cotton plantation. Then should we not flourish?
				Then should we not bring down the rascals to work at our own prices, and be thankful
				too? What's to step us? Trust me there is not a finer humbug going, than just making
				the country believe that the operatives are rampant for the repeal of the
				corn-laws." </p>
			<p>"It is a treat to hear you, Sir Matthew. I should be at a loss to name any man that I
				thought your equal in the gift of eloquence. But, nevertheless, we must not forget
				business. We must not forget Master Michael Armstrong, Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p> "No, no, my good friend, we will not forget him. Be patient for a moment, and I will
				make you understand how my friend Elgood Sharpton, and my darling <hi>protégé</hi>
				have been mixed up in my mind together. Sharpton's factory at Deep Valley is one of
				the most perfect institutions, I take it, that the ingenuity of man every produced.
				It is perfect, sir, — just perfect. In the first place it is build in a wild
				desolate spot, where the chances are about ten thousand to one against <pb n="120"/>
				any of the travelling torments who take upon themselves to meddle and make about
				what does not concern them — it is a hundred thousand to one against their ever
				catching sight of it. You never saw such a place in your life, Crockley. 'Tis such a
				hole that I don't believe the sunshine was ever known to get to the bottom of it. It
				was made on purpose, you may depend upon it. Well, sir, Sharpton, who whatever he
				udnertakes is sure to get over the ground faster than any other man, for he never
				lets any thing stop him, Sharpton felt quite convinced, you see, that the only way
				to carry on the work to any good purpose was to UNDERSELL. And how was this to be
				done without loss instead of gain? That's a question I promise you that has puzzled
				many a man that was no fool — but, egad, it did not puzzle him. He knew well enough
				that it was not the material — that came cheap enough — nor yet the machinery,
				though Heaven knows that's dear enough; but 'tis the labour, sir, the damnation
				wages going on, on, on, for evermore that drains the money away. And what then does
				he do, but hit at once upon the very perfectest scheme that ever entered a man's
				head to lessen that ruinous burden. He knew well enough, for he has a most
				unaccountable deal of general information, that there were lots of parishes in
				England that didn't know what on earth to do with their pauper brats. There's many,
				you know, that say this one thing, this nasty filthy excess of pauper population is
				the very mischief that is eating up the country, and destroying our prosperity. But
				who's the greatest political economist, Crockley, the man who talks of the evil, or
				he who sets about finding a remedy? The political economists of the nineteenth
				century ought to erect a statue to Elgood Sharpton; and so they will, I have no
				doubt, when the subject come to be more perfectly understood. For just mark what he
				has done. First he finds out this capital spot for the job, and builds a factory
				there; next he either goes himself, or sends agents, good, capable, understanding
				men, to all the parishes that he finds are overburdened with poor. Then, sir, he
				enters philosophically into the subject with the parish authorities, but of course
				with proper discretion, and proves to them that in no way could they do their duty
				by the parish children, particularly the orphans, or those whose parents don't
				trouble them, so well as by apprenticing them to a GOOD TRADE." </p>
			<p>Here Sir Matthew paused, and a merry glance was exchanged between him and his
				companion.</p>
			<p> "Well, Crockley, it is a good trade, you know, a devilish good trade, isn't it? At
				any rate I promise you that so many parishes felt convinced of it, that Elgood
				sharpton had soon got Deep Valley factory as full of young hands as it could cram.
				Now it is since that, you must know, that old Sir Robert took in into his head that
				little children must not be overworked. He it was, I believe, that first set up that
				nonsensical cry to any purpose; and to be sure, nothing ever was so absurd in a
				country where every body knows that if the young pauper spawn could but be made to
				die off, every thing would go on well. Is it not strange now, that old Peel could
				not be contented to <pb n="121"/> grow rich, and hold his tongue? but no, he got bit
				by some poisonous humanity notion or other, and a devilish shake he gave to the
				system just at first, by his absurd bill for the protection of infant paupers; but
				such men as Sharpton are not to be knocked down like ninepins, either by law-makers,
				or law; and to say the truth, old Sir Robert Peel's bill was to all intents and
				purposes a dead letter within two years after it was passed. Bless your soul, it was
				the easiest thing in the world to keep the creatures so ignorant about the bill,
				after first talk was over, the they might have been made to believe any thing and to
				submit to any thing. In fact the question for them always lies in an egg-shell. They
				must either do what the masters would have them, OR STARVE. That fact is worth all
				the bills that ever were passed: and another thing is, that as long as there's
				nothing to prevent our own friends and relations from being among the magistrates,
				even if complaints are made, we can manage them." </p>
			<p>"How true it is, Sir Matthew, that there is no inequality of accidental condition
				that can equal the inequality produced by a decided superiority in the intellectual
				powers," said Dr. Crockley. "At this moment I give you my sacred honour that I look
				upon, you and your friend Mr. Elgood Sharpton also, as standing in a much more
				commanding position than any duke in the country. What's a long descent compared to
				a long head, Sir Matthew? I'll tell you what the difference is. A long descent
				pretty generally helps a man to empty his purse, whereas a long head will never fail
				to help him fill it. It is as clear to me, as that the sun's in heaven, Sir Matthew,
				that the game is in your own hands. I know — for I have made some curious
				experiments that way — I know what a dog may be taught to do by hunger, and you may
				rely upon it that it is just as powerful in a man. Egad, Sir Matthew, it is a very
				fine subject for scientific experiments. It is difficult to say how far it might go.
				If a dog, for example, may be taught tricks by hunger, that approach in ingenuity to
				the powers of man, why may not man, skilfully acted upon by the same principle, be
				brought to rival the docility of a dog?"</p>
			<p>"I see nothing in nature to stop it, doctor," replied Sir Matthew, with an air of
				great animation. "But remember, my dear Crockley, this is not a point to be touched
				upon in the book we were talking of. The public, you know, can have nothing on earth
				to do with the private regulation of our affairs. People have just as much right to
				inquire at what o'clock my lord duke expects his valet to get up, and moreover what
				the valet eats for breakfast when he is up, as they have to know what hours our
				hired laborers keep, and what they feed upon. It is a gross inquisitorial
				interference, Crockley, and ought not to be though of in a free country."</p>
			<p> "That's a first-rate idea though, Sir Matthew," said the doctor, taking out his
				pocket-book and pencil. "I must book that. It is turning the parliament into an
				office of the inquisition. The canters may call it a <hi>holy office</hi> , if they
				will, but the British people will never bear the notion of AN INQUISTION. That's a
				capital idea, I promise <pb n="122"/> you. As to my parallel, you know, between a
				dog and a man, it is merely between ourselves, or such an out-and-out-friend as Mr.
				Sharpton, and it may be worth thinking about, perhaps, practically and
				scientifically, I mean; but certainly I should never dream of printing it. A hundred
				years hence human intelligent may have reached such a point of improvement that the
				plain good sense and practical utility of the idea may make it properly appreciated.
				but as yet we are not sufficiently advanced in the science emphatically denominated
				" <hi>the positive</hi> " in contradistinction to " <hi>the ideal</hi> ." It will
				come though, if we do but go on in the path we are in. But we are generalizing too
				much, Sir Matthew; nevertheless I suspect I have caught you idea. You have thoughts
				of sending your young favoiurite to Deep Valley mill, by way of putting the
				finishing stroke to your benevolent projects in his favour?" </p>
			<p>"Exactly so, my dear friend. But we must have indentures, observe; and there is some
				little difficulty in that."</p>
			<p>"I suppose you know best, Sir Matthew; else I should say that indentures cannot be
				necessary. From your description, the locality of this factory, with its romantic
				name, must be like the valley of Rasselas, at least in one particular — namely, that
				without wings the happy dwellers there would find it impossible to excape," replied
				the doctor.</p>
			<p>"Difficult, exceedingly difficult, certainly; but not quite impossible; for without
				indentuires a runaway could not be legally pursued. And to tell you the truth,
				friend Crockley, I should not much approve giving a subject for a second part of Mr.
				Osmond Norval's dramma, in which the hero should appear upon the scene after a few
				months's residence in Deep Valley mills."</p>
			<p>"That's true. But I don't see under what pretence you are to get the brat apprenticed
				to your friend Sharpton," remarked the cautious counsellor.</p>
			<p>"If he is apprenticed to me, it will do just as well," replied the knight, "for I
				could make over the indentures to Sharpton easy enough, but it strikes me I might
				have some difficulty in making the mother consent to it."</p>
			<p>"Not if you will be upon your P's and Q's, Sir Knight," said his friend: "you have
				nothing to do but go on sending tit-bits to the sick woman, and the rickety boy that
				you mentioned, and when they have got a little used to it she'll not choose to
				affront her <hi>generous benefactor</hi> . Remember the dog theory, Sir Matthew,
				they are all alike."</p>
			<p>"I dare say you are right. but at any rate I had better keep out of that hateful
				brat's way, or rather take care that he keeps out of mine. But I shall bear the
				sight of him better if I make up my mind to send him to Deep Valley. Taht will wipe
				out old scores between us."</p>
			<p> Having said this, Sir Matthew rose from the breakfast-table, seeming therby to
				indicate that the consultation was at an end. Dr. <pb n="123"/> Crockley rose too;
				but, though he took up his hat and his riding-whip from the chair on which he had
				placed them, he lingered as if he had still something to say before he took his
				leave. </p>
			<p>Sir Matthew, however, seemed to take no notice of the hint, but stretching out his
				hand said decisively, "Good morning, doctor, good morning. Let us see you again
				soon."</p>
			<p>Dr. Crockley upon this stretched out his hand too, but instead of clutching that of
				the knight, he seized upon his button. "One word, Sir Matthew, one word. You are too
				much of a man of business to think me troublesome. Respecting that little
				appointment that you were talking about the other day; I should like to have it
				settled. Because, to say the truth, I shall consider myself as weaking your livery;
				or, to speak more fitly, to be fighting positively under your colors, when this is
				done; and of course you know we ought to understand one another completely."</p>
			<p>"No doubt of it, Crockely. I said nothing that I do not mean to stand to. You shall
				have two hundred a year, paid quaterly, for attending to the health and wellbeing,
				and all that, you know, of the factory children. But as I don't want you to give
				them two hundred pounds' worth of physic, remember I shall expect that you will make
				up the deficiency in — in just saying round about the neighbourhood how remarkably
				well every thing goes on at Brookford Factory. I'll peldge you my word that every
				thing does go on capitally well there, Crockley, so you will have nothing on your
				conscience on that score."</p>
			<p>"I am not afraid of that, Sir Matthew; I know I may trust you. But I should like a
				bit of a memorandum about my own business, if you please."</p>
			<p>"Quite right, quite right, sir. I am too much a man of business to object to that.
				Draw up the engagement, such as you wish it to be, and I dare say I shall make no
				objection to signing it."</p>
			<p>After this a cordial hand-shaking was exchanged and the friends parted.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XII. </head>
			<p>AN UNFORTUNATE RENCONTRE — AN ADVENTURE — MISS BROTHERTON GROWS WISER EVERY DAY.</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Tremlett's inquiries proved successful. Jim Sykes, the
				weeding-boy, knew perfectly well where widow Armstrong lived; and after he had
				repeated his instructions three times, Mary Brotherton and her unresisting chaperon
				set off on their expedition. On one <pb n="124"/> point only did the self-willed
				heiress yeild to the judgment of her companion. Mary, who knew, that though she
				seldom went beyond the shelter of her own park-paling, she often walked without
				fatigue within it for two or three hours together, wished to set off for Hoxley-lane
				on foot; but Mrs. Tremlett talked so much of the fatigue, that the good-natured girl
				consented to let the carriage convey them to the point at which the lane diverged
				from the high-road. This yielding, however, was wholly from consideration for her
				companion. For herself she believed the precaution quite needless; and she was
				right. However much her temper might have been endangered by the series of spoiling
				processes she had undergone, her health had been taken good care of, and few girls
				of her age in any rank, had greater power and will for exertion than herself. </p>
			<p>Nevertheless, before she had driven half a mile, she heartily rejoiced at having
				sacrificed her own inclination to that of her good nurse; for the road to Ashleigh
				was the favourite ride of the officers quartered in the neighbourhood, and had she
				been seen on foot, it is probable that before reaching Hoxley-lane she would have
				been surrounded by a body-guard of military. So greatly did this danger appal her
				spirits, that the frist moment she found herself free from a white-gloved hand
				either at one window or the other, she stopped the carriage, and ordered the
				coachman to go far enough down the lane to permit her to ge out unoberserved by any
				persons passing by the road.</p>
			<p>But poor Mary was this day doomed to disappointment; and the indignant, and almost
				passionate beating of her heart under it, made her more conscious, perhaps, than she
				had ever been before, how deeply the business upon which she was engaged had entered
				into her soul.</p>
			<p>Soon after Sir Matthew Dowling had dismissed his breakfast companion, he strolled out
				towards his splendid stables, and perceiving his son loitering among the grooms, and
				himself equipped for the saddle, he inquired whither he was going to ride. "Only to
				Ashleigh, governor," was the reply. "Then wait five minutes, Augustus, and I will
				ride with you."</p>
			<p>Whether the youth approved the proposal or not, he was fain to submit to it, and the
				evil star of Mary Brotherton contrived to bring them to the top of Hoxley-lane at
				the moment her carriage was about to turn into it.</p>
			<p>"Stop!" cried the young lady, accompanying the word with a very energetic pull at the
				check-string. "Go on to Ashleigh," was the order the followed.</p>
			<p>"Was ever any thing so provoking, nurse? Do you see who those hateful men are?"</p>
			<p>"Why 'tis Sir Matthew, my dear," replied the gentle old woman.</p>
			<p>"The wretch!" muttered Mary between her teeth at the very moment that sir Matthew on
				one side, and his languishing son on the other, besieged her carriage.</p>
			<p> "Not for my right hand would I have him guess where I am going," <pb n="125"/>
				thought she, as with a face suffused with the deepest carmine that agitation could
				produce, she forced her lips into an unmeaning smile in return to their salutation. </p>
			<p>The father and son came to exactly the same conclusion, and at the same moment. There
				was but one cause that it was possible to assign for her evident emotion. She was
				deeply in love with Augustus, — more deeply then even the young man himself had
				imagined. The thing was plain, no doubt remained, no not a shadow of it on the mind
				of either father or son, but it was the elder gentleman only who at once determined
				to push so fine a game to its close, with as little delay as possible.</p>
			<p>Feeling quite sure that there was no liberty he could take at this moment which would
				not be welcome, he made a sign t the coachman to stop, and deliberately dismounting
				he threw his reins to his groom, told Miss Brotherton's footman to open the
				carriage-door, and stepped in with the assumed air of a partially loved friend, who
				knows that no leave need be asked.</p>
			<p>Mary shrunk back into her corner with considerably more disgust than if a reptile had
				possessed itself of the seat opposite.</p>
			<p>"This is not quite as it should be, is it?" said Sir Matthew, with a leer. "Perhaps
				so me other may have a better right here than I?" And a very expressive smile
				accompanied the words.</p>
			<p>"Sir?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Come, come, my dear child, you must not look vexed at any of my little jokes. You
				know how we all dote upon you! Dear creature! How beautiful that sweet blush make
				you look! He, he! there goes poor Augustus looking very much as if he could wring
				his papa's neck off. But his turn, we will hope, may come by and by. and now, my
				dear, I'll tell you what I am come here for. We all want you, and your good Mrs.
				Tremlett too, if she likes it, to come over to us quite <hi>en famille</hi>
				to-morrow. I don't know what love-powder you have been scattering amongst us, but
				there is not a single individual of the family who does not positively dote upon
				you. Tell me my pretty Mary, do you feel a little kindness for some of us in
				return?"</p>
			<p>An attempt to take her hand accompanied this speech; and Mrs. Tremlett, who estimated
				pretty nearly her young lady's affection for Sir Matthew and his race, actually
				trembled for the consequences. But, to her great surprise, Mary answered, after the
				pause of a minute, "Oh, dear Sir Matthew! you are only laughing at me!" in a voice
				so exceedingly chilldish and silly, that it might, under similar circumstances, have
				made the fortune of a comic actress; and though she did not permit him to touch the
				hand he attempted to take, she placed it, together with its fellow, so playfully
				behind her, that Sir Matthew could only laugh and call her, "dear pretty
				creature!"</p>
			<p>Meanwhile the carriage proceeded to penetrate through the dirty dismal streets,
				which, in that direction, formed the suburb of Ashleigh.</p>
			<p>"I must get out here," said Miss Brotherton, suddenly pulling the check-string.</p>
			<pb n="126"/>
			<p>"Here? Impossible, my dear child!"</p>
			<p>"Nothing is impossible t me, that I choose to do, sir," said the young lady,
				springing to the ground the moment the door was opened. The knight was fain to
				follow, the animated Augustus threw himself from his horse at the same instant, and
				Mrs. Tremlett held herself suspended on the step of the carriage to learn what she
				was required to do.</p>
			<p>"I wish to know what is the matter with these miserable-looking children," said Mary,
				approaching a half-open door, at each side of which, crouching on the stone step,
				sat a pale and squalid-looking girl. The eldest might be ten years old, the youngest
				was certainly not more than six.</p>
			<p>"Gracious Heaven! you are not going to speak to those creatures, Miss Brotherton?"
				exclaimed Sir Matthew, while his son instinctively backed his horse into the middle
				of the street.</p>
			<p>"And why not, Sir Matthew?" said Mary.</p>
			<p>"You are not aware of what you are doing; I give you my honour you are not. You have
				no conception that these sort of creatures are. My dear, dear Miss Brotherton, get
				into your carriage — get into your carriage, I conjure you!</p>
			<p>Mary looked at him, but said not a word in reply.</p>
			<p>"What ails you, little girl?" said she, putting her hand upon the shoulder of the
				youngest child.</p>
			<p>"Billy-roller," answered the little creature.</p>
			<p>"The billy-roller smashed her," said the eldest girl,"but 'twas falling asleep
				against the machinery as lamed me."</p>
			<p>"Are you mad, Miss Brotherton!" exclaimed Sir Matthew. "Surely, Mrs. Tremlett, you
				ought to prevent your young lady from exposing herself to such scenes as these."</p>
			<p>"Good morning, Sir Matthew, do not let me detain you," said the heiress, suddenly
				assuming the tone and style of a woman of fashion who chose to have her own way.
				"These sick little creatures quite interest me. Besides, I must positively find out
				who Billy Roller is."</p>
			<p>"It is an instrument used in the works, Miss Brotherton. You know not to what you are
				exposing yourself — fraud, filth, infection, drunkenness! I give you my sacred
				honour that I think you are very likely to be robbed and murdered if you approach
				the thresholds of such dwellings as these."</p>
			<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir Matthew," replied the heiress, "but you must excuse me if I
				obstinately persevere in judging for myself; I know I am a spoiled child, neither
				more nor less; and as such you must either give me up or bear with me. Permit me to
				wish you good morning; I shall do more than approach the threshold of this dwelling
				— I shall enter it."</p>
			<p>Having said this, she waited no further parley, but taking a ragged child in each
				hand set her little foot against the door which already stood ajar, pushed it open,
				and walked in.</p>
			<p> Her first idea on looking round her was that perhaps Sir Matthew was in the right.
				Filth she saw; infection might lurk under it; and <pb n="127"/> who could tell if
				fraud and drunkenness might not enter the moment after, to complete the group? </p>
			<p>But there was little of selfishness and much of courage in the heart of Mary
				Brotherton, so she presently forgot every notion of personal danger, and was thus
				enabled to see things as they really were.</p>
			<p>On one side of the small bare chamber, and in some degree sheltered by the door which
				opened against it, stood a rickety machine once intended for a bedstead. Two of the
				legs had given place to brickbats, and instead of a bed the unsteady frame now
				supported only a thin layer of very dirty straw, with the body of a dying female
				stretched upon it. The only other article of furniture in the room was an old deal
				box without a cover, but having a couple of planks, each about three feet long, laid
				across it; serving either for table or chairs as occasion might require. The walls,
				the floor, the ceiling, and the remnant of a window, were all alike begrimed with
				smoke and dirt.</p>
			<p>It took not long to make this inventory, and having completed it, the young lady,
				still holding in each hand a staring child, turned towards the inhabitant of this
				miserable den, and said,</p>
			<p>"Are you ill, my good woman?"</p>
			<p>The being she addressed raised her heavy eyes, and in a voice so low as to be
				scarcely intelligible, answered "Yes."</p>
			<p>"Have you no assistance, nobody to nurse you?"</p>
			<p>"Nobody but these," pointing to the children.</p>
			<p>"Has any doctor seen her?" demanded Mary of the eldest child.</p>
			<p>"No ma'am," replied the little girl.</p>
			<p>"And how long has she been ill?"</p>
			<p>"Ever since she com'd from the mill."</p>
			<p>"And how long is that?"</p>
			<p>"A twelvemonth," said the little one.</p>
			<p>"I don't know," said the elder.</p>
			<p>"But, my poor children, you are not the only people that live with her, I suppose?
				Have you got any father?"</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"Where is he?"</p>
			<p>"At the mill."</p>
			<p>"Have you got any body else belonging to you?" said Miss Brotherton, shuddering.</p>
			<p>"There's Sophy, and Dick, and Grace," replied the eldest child.</p>
			<p>"Where are they all?" again inquired Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"At the mill," was again the answer.</p>
			<p>"Are Sophy and Grace grown up?"</p>
			<p>"Sophy is," answered the child, "and Grace, almost."</p>
			<p>"Then why do they not stay at home, one of them at least, to take care of this poor
				woman?"</p>
			<p>"'Cause they mustn't. I 'tends mother."</p>
			<p>"You are not big enough to take care of her, my poor child. Why don't you go to the
				factory, and let one of the bigger ones stay at home?"</p>
			<pb n="128"/>
			<p>"They won't have me now, 'cause of this." — and as she spake, the child held up a
				little shrivelled right-hand, three fingers of which had a joint deficient. "I can't
				piece now, and so they won't let me come."</p>
			<p>"And Sophy won't let me go, 'cause of this," said the little one, slipping her arm
				out of a bedgown (which was the only garment she had), and displaying the limb
				swollen and discoloured, from some violent contusion.</p>
			<p>"My poor little creature! how did you do this?" said Mary, tenderly, taking the
				little hand in hers, and examining the frightful bruise.</p>
			<p>"'Twas the billy-roller," said the little girl, in an accent that seemed to insinuate
				that the young lady was more than commonly dull of apprehension.</p>
			<p>"But how did it happen, my child? Did some part of the machinery go over you?"</p>
			<p>"No! — That was me," cried the elder, with a loud voice, and again holding up her
				demolished fingers. "'Twas the stretcher's billy-roller as smalshed Becky."</p>
			<p>"'Twas, cause I was sleepy," said the little one, beginning to cry, for she construed
				Mary's puzzled look into an expression of displeasure.</p>
			<p>"They beats 'em dreadful ma'am," said the sick woman, evidently exerting herself
				beyond her strength. "She's a good little girl for work; but they will fall asleep,
				all of 'em at times, when they be kept so dreadful long."</p>
			<p>"But these bruises could not be the effect of beating," said Mary, again examining
				the arm, "it is quite impossible."</p>
			<p>"Why, ma'am, the billy-roller as they beats 'em with, is a stick big enough to kill
				with; and many and many is the baby that has been crippled by it."</p>
			<p>There was something so hollow, so sunken in the woman's voice, that Miss Brotherton
				felt terrified. The fact that a child of the size of the baby before her should have
				been beaten with such a weapon, and with such violence, seemed wholly incredible.
				Again she thought of Sir Matthew Dowling's warning, and wished that she were not
				alone.</p>
			<p>"I am afraid that you are very ill," said she, "and I know not how I can help you.
				Money I can give, but there is nobody here to make use of it for you."</p>
			<p>"Money!" murmured the sinking woman from her layer of straw. "Money, you can give
				money? Oh! give it, give it. Give it to her — give it to the child; she knows what
				it is, she knows I am dying for the want of it. It is too late for me, but give it,
				give it, and may God — "</p>
			<p>Here the miserable creature's strength wholly failed; her eyes closed, and to all
				appearance, she was already a corpse.</p>
			<p>"Oh! this is very dreadful!" cried poor Mary, wringing her hands, "nurse will know
				better than me," and so saying, she turned eagerly towards the door.</p>
			<pb n="129"/>
			<p>"She be gone, mother, and haven't gived nothing," said the eldest girl, in a voice so
				mournfully expressive of disappointment, that in spite of her alarm, Mary stopped to
				take half-a-crown from her purse, which she put into the child's hand.</p>
			<p>She looked at the coin, and in a half-whisper ejaculated, "Oh!" Then creeping to the
				bed, she put it into the palm of her mother's hand, pressing the fingers down upon
				it, and in an accent of interrogation uttered the word "Bread?"</p>
			<p>This Mary heard, but not the answer to it, for she had quitted the scene before it
				was uttered. On opening the door of the house, she started at seeing Sir Matthew
				Dowling still within a dozen yards of it; he was standing beside the carriage, with
				one arm extended to keep the door of it open, and the other resting against the
				vehicle on the opposite side of the opening, while his head thrust forward within an
				inch of good Mrs. Tremlett's nose effectually prevented her following her young
				lady, however much she might have wished to do so. He had, indeed, upon Miss
				Brotherton's disappearance reseated the good woman almost by force, and then
				addressed her in such a strain as was rapidly working her up to make an attempt to
				escape from the other side of the carriage, when the reappearance of the young lady
				released her from her thraldom.</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Tremlett!" he said, "are you aware of the awful responsibility which will rest
				upon you if any thing unfortunate happens to your amiable, but most headstrong young
				lady? All the neighbourhood know, Mrs. Tremlett, that she has, as it were, placed
				herself for protection in your hands, refusing all other counsel, and shutting her
				ears to all other advice, and it is thus that you perform your duty!"</p>
			<p>"Good God, sir! what do you mean?" said the good woman, in great agitation. "Let me
				out if you please, sir. If my young lady is in any danger, it is wicked to keep me
				sitting here. let me out, sir!"</p>
			<p> "I will let you out, Mrs. Tremlett," replied the knight, still firmly retaining the
				position which so effectually kept her in, "I will let you out; but first, for her
				sake and your own, it is my duty to tell you in a few words the sort of place she
				has now thought proper to enter. Don't struggle, Mrs. Tremlett, but hear me. It is
				not possible they can do her any personal injury as long as I am so near the door of
				the house as at present. Be very sure that from some hole or corner of the filthy
				premises, some spying eyes are at this moment watching us. There is no danger of her
				being murdered now, but as sure as you sit there, Mrs. Tremlett, murdered she will
				be, if she goes without the protection of a powerful arm within such dens of sin and
				iniquity as she has entered now. One short moment more, Mrs. Tremlett — one short
				moment, while I tell what the creatures are among whom she has thrown herself. The
				house is notorious as one of the very worst in Ashleigh. The man is an habitual
				drunkard, whom I, and my excellent servant Parsons, have endeavoured in every
				possible way to reform — but in vain. The moment he has got his wages, he goes to
					<pb n="130"/> the gin-shop, and often and often he won't work at all, which of
				course prevents his family from being in the comfortable easy circumstances which
				they ought to be. If he happens to be in the house now, I dare say there is no
				species of indecent language to which your young lady will not be obliged to listen.
				As to the mother of the family, I believe she is dying in consequence of a life
				passed in all sorts of the most abominable wickedness. Indeed I believe she is now
				half mad, for I have been told by some of my people whom I have sent upon charitable
				visits of inquiry to her, that she lies in her bed inventing the strangest lies
				imaginable. Indeed some think that notwithstanding she is so near death she still
				drinks, and that it is nothing but drunken lies that she makes people listen to." </p>
			<p>"Pray, pray let me get out, Sir Matthew! Being murdered, sir, is not the only thing
				from which I should wish to save Miss Brotherton."</p>
			<p>"One word more, Mrs. Tremlett, and I have done. The eldest girl is a notorious
				prostitute. Another, a year or two younger is going the same way. The boy is
				suspected of being an extremely skilful thief, and the two younger girls, for they
				all work at my factory, Mrs. Tremlett, and I know them well, the two younger ones
				are such depraved little wretches, that for the sake of example we have been obliged
				to turn them out of the mill, though we are in great want of young hands to do the
				work. Now, madam, I have done, and I leave it with you to judge how far it will be
				right and proper for Miss Brotherton to continue such frolics as these."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew was in the act of pronouncing the last words of this speech as Miss
				Brotherton opened the door of the house, and stepped out into the street.</p>
			<p>On first perceiving her, the knight appeared about to take her hand, for the purpose
				of replacing her in the carriage; but his attention was called to the sound of many
				feet suddenly turning the corner of a street which led from a neighbouring factory.
				It proceeded from the workpeople, who were rushing home in scrambling haste to
				snatch their miserable dinners.</p>
			<p>Gentlemen in Sir Matthew Dowling's situation, and enjoying the species of influence
				which belongs to it, take little or no pains to avoid meeting the people they
				themselves employ. They look not in the young eyes to read what sort of blessing
				cowers there, nor heed the crippled gait, or pallid visage of those who exist but by
				the poisonous employment which he gives them. But such gentlemen seldom, if they can
				avoid it, expose themselves to the remarks of any gangs belonging to their
				neighbours, and no sooner did Sir Matthew become aware that the mill in the next
				street was pouring forth its fifteen hundred hands, than he turned from the young
				lady who had passed by without appearing to see him, and taking his horse from the
				hand of the groom who held it, sprung with great activity into the saddle, and
				galloped off the way his indignant son had galloped before him.</p>
			<pb n="131"/>
			<p>Mary Brotherton meanwhile was utterly unconscious of the approaching throng; and
				intent only upon getting Mrs. Tremlett out of the carriage, turned her eyes neither
				to the right nor the left, but seizing her by the arm, exclaimed, "Come to me nurse,
				come to me!"</p>
			<p>The good woman who was quite as desirous as herself of the reunion, required no
				second summons, but more quickly than it can be told, was first by the side of her
				young mistress in the street, and then entering with her the low door of the
				dwelling so fearfully described by Sir Matthew.</p>
			<p>Had Mrs. Tremlett possessed the power, most assuredly she would have turned the steps
				of her charge the other way, and for ever have prevented her from exposing herself
				to the contemplation of such depravity as she had heard described; but knowing
				perfectly well that no such power was vested in her, the next wish she conceived,
				was to give all the assistance and support she could to the dear wilful girl to whom
				she had devoted herself.</p>
			<p>Aware, as she entered the door, that many eyes followed them, nay, that many steps
				were stayed, apparently, to watch the spectacle so rare in Ashleigh of well-dressed
				ladies entering the sordid dwelling of operatives, Mrs. Tremlett herself closed the
				door as soon as they had both passed through it, and looking round upon the
				desolation of the chamber, trembled with an emotion made up of terror and
				compassion, at perceiving to what a scene the delicately-nurtured Mary Brotherton
				had introduced herself.</p>
			<p>"This woman is very ill, nurse Tremlett," said the young lady, drawing her close to
				the bed. "For God's sake tell me what we had better do for her?"</p>
			<p>"My dear, dear, Miss Mary come away, and send the doctor to her!" answered Mrs.
				Tremlett; positively shaking from head to foot, as she contemplated the ghastly
				countenance of the woman, the filthy rag that imperfectly covered her, and the
				scanty straw upon which her stiffening limbs were stretched. "This is no place for
				you, Miss Brotherton! come with me I say this moment, and we will send the doctor,
				and money, and clothes too, if you like it."</p>
			<p>"If I like it! — Do you think I am amusing myself, Mrs. Tremlett? — Feel her hand —
				feel her pulse! I believe she is dying."</p>
			<p>These words though spoken very quietly and deliberately, were uttered in a voice so
				unlike what she had ever heard from the young lady before, that the old woman became
				dreadfully alarmed.</p>
			<p>"Oh, good God! she is losing her senses!" were the words she uttered as she threw her
				arms round the person of Miss Brotherton, and vainly attempted to remove her from
				the spot on which she stood.</p>
			<p> "Fie upon you, Mrs. Tremlett!" said Mary, sternly, "do you fancy that you are doing
				me any good? Be satisfied that I am not losing my senses, and let me request that
				you will make an effort to recover yours. This woman's head is too low. My dear
				mother asked for pillows." Here the steady voice faltered, but it was now only for a
					<pb n="132"/> moment. "I want the cushions from the carriage nurse Tremlett,
				will you get them, or shall I?" </p>
			<p>Without answering a word the terrified old woman hastened to obey her, and did so in
				the best manner; for calling to the tall footman, who continued to stand beside the
				open door of the carriage, he obeyed the summons, which he supposed to be
				preparatory to his young mistress making her exit, by very unceremoniously thrusting
				right and left the curious group that still lingered on the threshold.</p>
			<p>"Give me the cushions from the carriage, Jones," she said, "make haste, for God's
				sake!"</p>
			<p>The man stared at her for an instant in utter astonishment, and then did as he was
				ordered.</p>
			<p>"Now get upon the box and bid the coachman drive as fast as he can go, to the nearest
				doctor's — that's Mr. Thomas, I think, in Cannon-street. — Tell him Miss Brotherton
				has sent for him, and desire him to get into carriage directly."</p>
			<p>Having uttered these commands as rapidly as she could speak, Mrs. Tremlett carried a
				couple of the carriage cushions to the bed, and with the assistance of Mary and the
				elder child, managed to raise the woman into a position apparently less distorted
				and painful than before.</p>
			<p>"Have you any thing to give her?" said Mrs. Tremlett, addressing the child.</p>
			<p>The little girl without answering, stepped to a sort of cupboard in the wall, and
				taking thence a pitcher without a spout, and a mug without a handle, contrived to
				tilt up the former so as to make it discharge a portion of its cotents into the
				latter.</p>
			<p>"It is water," said Mary, watching the operation. "It will not hurt her, will
				it?"</p>
			<p>"Nothing can hurt her, my dear love?" replied Mrs. Tremlett, her eyes filling with
				tears as she listened to the altered voice of her gay-hearted girl, whose smiles and
				frolics she had watched, and indulged, for so many years; but of whose deep feeling
				she had never conceived any idea till now. "I don't think anything can hurt her now,
				Mary. Her pulse flutters, and her forehead is quite damp. I have sent for Mr.
				Thomas, and he will probably be here immediately."</p>
			<p>Mary's only answer was silently pressing the hand of her old friend as she took from
				it the broken mug of water, and then, kneeling on the sordid floor, she applied it
				to the pale dry lips of the sufferer.</p>
			<p>The poor woman made an effort to meet it, and swallowed a mouthful eagerly; and then,
				relieved probably by the change of posture, and refreshed by the cool liquid, she
				stretched out the hand in which she still held Mary's half-crown, and said, "Go
				Betsy, buy — "</p>
			<p>The child she addressed, eagerly seized the money in the hand that had fingers to
				close upon it, and flitted through the door in an instant.</p>
			<p> The poor woman had again closed her eyes; but her breathing was <pb n="133"/> more
				tranquil, and Mary hoped she had fallen asleep. With this persuasion she stood
				perfectly still and silent beside her, her own hand locked, though she was not
				conscious of it, in the grasp of her deeply affected nurse, while her whole soul
				seemed settled in her eyes as she fixed them immovably upon what she felt to be the
				most awful spectacle that a mortal can gaze upon, namely, the passing of a human
				spirit from life to death. </p>
			<p>The little girl whose swollen and discoloured arm still remained uncovered, probably
				because she feared the pain likely to attend the replacing it in the sleeve, stood
				close beside her mother's head, childishly contemplating the cushions which
				supported it, and apparently as unconscious as they were, of the heavy loss that
				threatened her.</p>
			<p>But this stillness did not long remain uninterrupted. All the members of the family,
				who had been named as belonging to the factory, except the father, returned for the
				purpose of taking such rest and refreshment as one hour (nearly half of which was
				consumed by the walk to and from the mill) could permit. The latch was lifted by the
				eldest girl, a delicate featured, but dreadfully dirty creature of about seventeen,
				with a sort of sharp eagerness, denoting the curiosity excited by the sight of the
				carriage stationed before their dwelling. On perceiving the deathlike countenance of
				her mother, made distinctly visible by the noonday light, that streamed through the
				open door, she suddenly stopped, clasping her hands together, and uttering in tones
				that sounded like a shriek — "Oh! God, she is dead!"</p>
			<p>"No! not dead!" said Mary solemnly, and without turning her eyes from the object on
				which they were rivetted. "Not dead! — she is sleeping — Hush! — Do not disturb
				her!"</p>
			<p>Close following on the heels of the first, came a second girl, about a year her
				junior, but with a countenance much less prepossessing. Dirty she was too, it
				possible more so than the others, and there was a look of stolid stupidity about her
				that, but for the sort of reckless audacity which lurked in her eye, might have
				given the idea of an almost brutal want of animation. A thin consumptive-looking lad
				of about fourteen, followed after her, and closed the door behind him as he
				entered.</p>
			<p>"Oh! mother!" he exclaimed as her sunken face caught his eye, "I wish I was alongside
				of ye, and then we'd be buried together!" And without appearing conscious of the
				presence of the strangers, he suddenly threw himself upon the tottering bedstead,
				and nestling his face close to that of the dying woman, kissed her passionately
				again and again.</p>
			<p> "My boy, you may hasten her going by that," said Mrs. Tremlett, gently. "Be still,
				be still all of ye!" But as she spoke, she, and Mary too, whose hand she continued
				to hold, made way for the eldest girl, who now eagerly, but silently pressing
				forward, dropped on her knees beside the bed, and throwing her two arms over the
				emaciated body, remained with streaming eyes that rested piteously on the face of
				her mother. The second girl looked on, till by degrees her heavy countenance
				appeared to stiffen into horror, and she too drew near, <pb n="134"/> but with
				distended and tearless eyes, that seemed to speak more of fear than love. </p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett looked anxiously into the face of her charge. It was deadly pale, and
				wore an expression of solemnity so new and strange, that the good woman threw her
				arms around her in an agony of fond anxiety, exclaiming, "My Mary, my dear, dear
				child! come away! Mary, Mary, come away! you can do no good. This scene is not a fit
				one for you to witness."</p>
			<p>"You mistake, nurse. It is fit for me. It is necessary for me. Do not disturb me,
				nurse Tremlett! do not!" Then after a short pause, during which her eyes were
				closed, and her hands crossed upon her breast, she again whispered, "Could hse not
				pray with me? Shall I not ask her to pray with me?"</p>
			<p>"My sweet girl, she will not hear you, I think," said the old woman, while the tears
				streamed down her cheeks. "But you shall be satisfied my darling," and approaching
				the bed, and leaning over the girl who knelt beside it, Mrs. Tremlett in a low but
				distinct voice pronounced the words, "Shall we pary with you?"</p>
			<p>She was evidently heard and understood, for the hands that for some minutes had lain
				motionless, were with an effort brought together, and clasped in the attitude of
				prayer. Mary who was eagerly watching her every movement, suddenly stepped forward,
				and gliding in between the eldest and the youngest girl, dropped on her knees beside
				them. Mrs. Tremlett following close behind her, knelt also, and then with tremlbing
				lips, and faltering voice, but slowly, distinctly, and most reverentially, Mary
				Brotherton uttered the last and most impressive of those sentences in our litany
				which is followed by the solemn petition for deliverance. it was with a throb of
				pleasure at her heart, and an exclamation of thanksgiving from her tongue, that she
				heard the dying woman answer "Amen!"</p>
			<p>Almost at the very instant she did so, the latch was again lifted, and Mr. Thomas,
				one of the three medical practitioners of Ashleigh, entered. Miss Brotherton was not
				conscious of ever having seen him before; but he, like every one else in the
				neighbourhood, perfectly well knew the heiress by sight; and now, even no, in the
				awful chamber of death, bowed low before her.</p>
			<p>It would not be easy to describe the feeling with which she turned away from this
				ill-timed demonstration of respect. Yet it was with no harshness; for the struggle
				so often going on within us between our better and our worser natures, was at this
				moment so decidedly in favour of all that was good in her young heart, that there
				was hardly place for any severer feeling than pity within it.</p>
			<p>She had risen from her knees as he made his bow, and turning gravely towards him,
				said, "If any thing can be done sir, for this poor woman, let it not be delayed. I
				fear she is very ill."</p>
			<p> "Certainly, ma'am — certainly, Miss Brotherton, my best attention may be depended
				on. But will you first, my dear young lady, give me leave to observe that I would
				much rather see you in your carriage <pb n="135"/> than here. I really cannot answer
				for it. It is in point of fact impossible to say whether there may not be something
				deleterious, something noxious, in short, to your very precious health in the
				atmosphere of this room." </p>
			<p>"I thank you, sir. Be sure I will take quite sufficient care of myself; but it is not
				for me that your services are wanted — it is here!"</p>
			<p>Sophy, the eldest girl seemed unconscious of what was going on, for she remained
				perfectly motionless on the spot where she had first knelt down; while the third
				sister, who had been sent on the poor mother's last errand for bread, and who had
				crept back unobserved into the room during the foregoing scene, occupied the space
				on her right hand, Mary Brotherton having knelt on her left, so that there was
				scarcely space for the approach of the smart apothecary</p>
			<p>"Move, my dear girls!" said Mary, gently laying a hand on the shoulder of each.</p>
			<p>They both rose; while Mr. Thomas, carefully storing the anecdote in aid of the
				gossiping part of his practice, looked and listened with astonishment to what seemed
				to him the very <hi>unnatural conduct</hi> of the rich young lady, and internally
				exclaimed, "A clear case of religious mania this, as I ever saw! She won't live
				long, probably. What a match!"</p>
			<p>It required no very long examination of the poor patient, to discover that her last
				moment was rapidly approaching.</p>
			<p>"Upon my word, Miss Brotherton, I really wish I could persuade you to come away,"
				persisted the medical gentleman as he once more turned towards her. The air is
				becoming more mephitic every instant. "This woman is at the last extremity."</p>
			<p>"Nothing, then, can be done for her?" said Mary.</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am — nothing in the world. Not the whole college, if they were present, could
				keep soul and body together for another hour, I would venture to say."</p>
			<p>On this Miss Brotherton put a fee into his hand, and bent her head in token that his
				business there was ended, and that he might depart. But he did not immediately obey
				the hint, for pocketing the unwonted golden prize, he seemed anxious to remain a
				little longer where such blessings abounded, and returning to the bed, again took
				hold of the poor woman's hand, and then said in a voice of authority — "Let me have
				some water."</p>
			<p>It was Mary only who seemed to understand his words, and she immediately obeyed them,
				placing in his hand the broken mug which she had set aside upon the floor. The
				apothecary put the water to the lips of the poor woman, and she again swallowed a
				little of it, after which they saw her lips move as if she was making an effort to
				speak to them.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett lent over her, and then, with a stronger effort she articulated — "Let
				me see William!"</p>
			<p>"Who is William?" said Mrs. Tremlett raising herself, "Is it one of the
				children?"</p>
			<p>"It be father," said Betsy.</p>
			<pb n="136"/>
			<p>"Where is he to be found?" cried Miss Brotherton, eagerly. "Let him be sought for
				instantly — where is he likely to be?"</p>
			<p>"At the gin-shop," replied the ungracious Grace.</p>
			<p>"If you know where he is, go for him," said Mary, impressively, "and for God's sake
				let him not delay!"</p>
			<p>The girl she addressed stared at her as upon something utterly incomprehensible: but
				she obeyed, and, in so short a time as to show that the gin-shop was at no great
				distance, returned with a man of an exterior as filthy as the rest of his race,
				wretchedly crippled in the legs, and a complexion that spoke both of ill health, and
				intemperance.</p>
			<p>"What! — It is come to that, is it, already?" said the man looking wistfully at her
				from the bottom of the bed, but with a countenance whose lines seemed too fixed in
				the expression of hard indifference, to permit its exhibiting much feeling.</p>
			<p>"She asked for you, father," said Sophy gently, then taking one of her mother's hands
				in hers she murmured,"Mother! — Dear mother! — open your eyes upon us, father is
				here, and all of us" while large tear-drops fell upon the livid face as she hung
				over it.</p>
			<p>The dying eyes were once more opened, and consciousness, and recognition of them all,
				were visible as she suffered them to rest first on one, and then on another. The boy
				only, from his position,she could not see; but even then, there seemed intelligence
				between them, and she certainly knew he was lying beside her, for her head rested
				against his, and she raised her left hand till her fingers touched his cheek. The
				youngest child also when the mother's eyes opened, was too much behind her, but she
				seemed aware of her vicinity,and pronounced the words <hi>"Little one!"</hi>
				probably her usual appellation,so distinctly as to make the child start, and
				instantly climb upon the bed to kiss her. The last movement was an effort to return
				this kiss; and the next moment Mrs. Tremlett removed the child's clinging lips from
				a corse.</p>
			<p>A very awful interval of perfect stillness followed. "Can I be of any further service
				to you, Miss Brotherton?" from the lips of Mr. Thomas,were the first words that
				broke it.</p>
			<p>Poor Mary only shook her head, but Mrs. Tremlett replied, "No, thank you sir, nothing
				more;" and with repeated bows, and rather a reluctant step, he departed; turning,
				however, to give another glance at the heiress, as he passed out, for he was not
				without hopes that she might fall down in a fainting-fit. Nothing, however, of the
				kind happened, and he disappeared.</p>
			<p>"You will go now, Mary dear" whispered Mrs. Tremlett, "and I will come here to-morrow
				to inquire about them for you."</p>
			<p>"Yes, I will go now," replied the young lady,"I cannot comfort them." Then looking
				round upon the steadfast group, as if to discover which of them appeared in the
				fittest state of be spoken to, she fixed upon the little Betsy, and placing a couple
				of sovereigns in her hand, told her to take care of them and give them to her father
				presently, adding, "tell your sister Sophy to come up to my house. This," giving a
				card, "is the place where I live."</p>
			<pb n="137"/>
			<p>She then led the way to her carriage, Mrs. Tremlett followed, and the next moment
				they were driving rapidly from the abode of the most abject misery, to a residence
				which every quarter of the globe had contributed to render luxurious.</p>
			<p>It was evident that the heiress felt no inclination to converse; indeed, for by far
				the greater portion of the way her face was concealed by the bandkerchief which she
				held to her eyes, and Mrs. Tremlett had too much real feeling to disturb her. After
				driving, however, through the handsome lodge-gates, and sweeping up to the noble
				entrance of her mansion, where already, at the sound of her approaching carriage,
				two or three servants were seen waiting like a guard of honour to receive her, it
				seemed that her meditations had not been wholly confined to the deathbed scene she
				had witnessed, and that the sordid cabin, with its misery-stamped inhabitants, had
				made a deep impression; for the first, and for many hours the only words she uttered
				after her return, spoken to the ear of Mrs. Tremlett as they walked arm in arm
				together through the hall, were these:</p>
			<p>"I too am living by the profit of the factory house. Is the division just? — Oh, God!
				Is it holy?"</p>
			<p>The old woman felt that she trembled violently, but knew not what words to utter that

			<p>DISAGREEABLE MEDITATIONS — A CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEW WITH A FAITHFUL SERVANT — ANOTHER
				INTERVIEW, NOT QUITE SO CONFIDENTIAL WITH A DAUGHTER — MARTHA AND MICHAEL TAKE A
				PLEASANT WALK TOGETHER TO VISIT THE WIDOW ARMSTRONG — A CONSULTATION.</p>
			<p>
				It will be easily believed that Sir Matthew rode back to Dowling
				Lodge not in the very sweetest humour in the world. "Bring up a child in the way he
				should go," is an admirable proverb, and certain it is that when that "way" is
				agreeable, he does very rarely "depart from the same." Thus it happens that the
				young gentlemen and ladies, sons and daughters of the millocrats, who pile thousands
				upon thousands, and acres upon acres, by the secret mysteries of their wonderful
				compound of human and divine machinery, do rarely or never take their way into the
				dwellings that shelter and that hide the sufferings of their operatives. Nothing is
				so distasteful to a truly elegant mill-owner as <pb n="138"/> any allusion, domestic
				or foreign, gossiping or professional, religious or political, to his factory, or
				his factory people; and the gay fatherly phrase, "Don't talk of that, for God's
				sake, my dear! — it smells of the shop," has turned away many innocent eyes from
				contemplating that, which had they looked upon it, could hardly have endured so
				long. </p>
			<p>To know therefore that the wilful, whimsical, rich, and independent Mary Brotherton
				(while still too young to understand any thing whatever of the real nature of trade,
				and our glorious manufactures), — to know that she was beginning to thrust herself
				behind the scenes, and do Heaven knows what mischief among his devilish people,
				instead of minding her own business, and falling in love with his adorable son, was
				altogether too much to be borne with patience; and had it not been that the weather
				was so hot as to make him long for a draught of hock and iced water, a natural
				instinct would have made him turn aside from his park-gates, and pursue the by path
				which led to his factory, where, as he knew by experience, the sort of temper he was
				then in could find great relief, without any body but the overlookers being in the
				secret.</p>
			<p>As it was, however, Sir Matthew Dowling reached his home; and the first thing he
				heard from the man who threw wide its portals was, that Mr. Parsons was waiting for
				him in his study.</p>
			<p>"Bring me a biscuit, a bottle of Stein, and some iced water," said the knight in the
				accent of one not born to "enter the venerable presence of hunger, thirst, and
				cold," nor into that of heat or vexation either.</p>
			<p>"What's the matter now, Parsons?" said he, throwing himself into a delicious
				arm-chair, and perceiving by one glance at the sour visage before him, that
				something or other had gone wrong. "The mill's not burnt down I suppose, is it?"</p>
			<p>"And I'm not sure that would be the worst thing that could happen Sir Matthew, if it
				was," replied the confidential servant. "It is well insured you know, sir, and would
				bring in a famous sum, as sure as the bank, and that's more, I take it, than we can
				say of all our debts."</p>
			<p> "Who the devil has been gossiping with you about the debts? What business is that of
				yours, I should like to know? Mind your billy-rollers Mr. Parsons, and take care
				your hands keep up with your machinery, that's your work; — and I can tell you, if
				you don't know it already, that the success of the concern depends more upon that,
				than upon any other thing whatever. The building is paid for, and the glorious
				machinery is paid for — mind that, sir, and where's the interest of it to come from
				if you let the hands go to sleep over it? I tell you what, Mr. Parsons, an
				overlooker is not worth his salt if he does not continually keep it in his head,
				that the more the machinery is improved the faster must the brats move to follow it.
				And you may rely upon it that where this is remembered early and late, day hours and
				night hours, the concern <hi>will</hi> answer, and every manager of it, master or
				man, will live well. But, by the Lord Harry! where it is not, they are as sure to go
				the wrong side of the post, as you are to go to bed to-night. <pb n="139"/> It
				stands to reason, Parsons. If one man knows how to drive, and another doesn't, the
				one man's team will pay, and the other's won't; and I will be much obliged to any
				man who will tell me how I am to help being undersold in the market, if I don't
				contrive to make my machinery go as fast, and as long too, as the best of 'em.
				That's the business you are to attend to, Mr. Parsons, and I won't trouble you about
				any other." </p>
			<p>"All true, Sir Matthew, every word of it. And I can't but say, though I scorn to be a
				boaster, — I can't but say, that I think I have given you reason to trust me. I am
				noted for being able to keep the children awake, and going longer than any other man
				in the mill. There isn't an overlooker in Ashleigh that can equal me with the strap
				or the billy-roller either, when I chooses to make 'em tell."</p>
			<p>"I know all that, my good fellow, and I value your services accordingly. But I have
				been devilishly put out this morning, and that makes me snappish; besides, I am
				quite sure you have got something disagreeable to tell, by your face. So out with
				it, man, and make an end of it."</p>
			<p>"Make an end of it, Sir Matthew?" replied Parsons, repeating the last words of the
				sentence with marked emphasis, "by the Lord, sir, that is exactly what I'm come to
				beg you to do. You must make an end of your charity job, Sir Matthew, for it don't
				answer in any way: we have lost one of the nimblest set of fingers we had, that
				wanted nothing but the strap to keep 'em going for sixteen hours out of the
				four-and-twenty, and I wish you could just hear what gratitude you have gained in
				return for it. There is not a single day comes round that the rickety little
				Armstrong don't blubber over his work like a church spout. And I overheard him, the
				young villain, when he didn't think I was so near — I overheard him when the
				scavenger-girl, as was cleaning under the mules, looked up and asked, why for he
				cried, when his brother had got such good fortune — I heard him answer. And what do
				you think he said, Sir Matthew?"</p>
			<p>"How the devil should I know?" replied the chafed capitalist. "Don't stand mumming
				there, but out with it."</p>
			<p>"Neither more nor less than this, Sir Matthew: 'Don't talk of his good fortune, Bet,'
				says he, 'he's the most unhappiest boy in all the world,' says he."</p>
			<p>"Pestilent little vermin!" exclaimed Sir Matthew through his closed teeth. "Infernal
				fool that I was to listen to that idiot woman! — and Crockley too, who ought to know
				better, has been badgering me exactly with the same execrable nonsense. Never again
				as long as I live will I be persuaded to try any other scheme with the people than
				what we have always acted upon. Brutes and beasts they are, and like brutes and
				beasts they should be treated; — and so they shall by me, as long as my head's above
				ground."</p>
			<p> "Well, sir, I can't but say I am glad you are come back to your right mind, as one
				may call it. Such romantical goings on can never answer in a factory, Sir Matthew.
				It an't the way to do business, and business is what we have got to do. And so, sir,
				I hope you will send <pb n="140"/> that scamp Mike back to the mill to-morrow
				morning, for they can't say no worse of it, let us pay him off as we will, than that
				he's the most unhappiest boy in all the world. And that's what they says already." </p>
			<p>"It won't do, Parsons. That boy must be got rid of. — What do you stare for, you ass?
				Do you think I am going to get hanged for him?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear no, Sir Matthew — you know the value of your own life better than that, any
				how, — God forbid you should not. Only I did not overwell understand what you meant
				by getting rid of him."</p>
			<p>"I must contrive to send him out of the way, at least out of this neighbourhood; and
				moreover with his own consent and his mother's too. That is what I meant, Mr.
				Parsons."</p>
			<p>"You must know best, Sir Matthew. But it seems to me you are taking a deal of trouble
				about him. If you'll just let me have him back in the mill, I think I'll venture to
				say that he shall never get within reach of plaguing you any more — and I'd get a
				pennyworth out of him into the bargain."</p>
			<p>"For a tolerably sharp fellow, Parsons, you're devilish dull about this business.
				Can't you guess that I should not be taking all the trouble you talk of, about such
				a beggar's brat as that, unless I had reasons for it. There's that lord's daughter
				that got me into the scrape, won't she be ferreting and ferreting till she finds out
				that the sweet little master has not found himself comfortable here? And ten times
				worse than her, — ay, a hundred fold, is that obstinate headstrong girl of old
				Brotherton's. My Lady Clarissa might be troublesome from mere folly, and might
				perhaps be stopped short in any mischief she was doing, by a few words from me. But
				not the old one himself could stop Mary Brotherton if she got a whim in her head.
				You should have seen her just now, Mr. Parsons, raving at me with her colour up and
				her eyes flashing, for all the world as if she had just escaped out of Bedlam, only
				because I cautioned her against going into Joe Drake's pigsty, — a pretty place
				wasn't it for a girl of her fortune to go visiting? But in she went, by heaven! and
				you may rely upon it, if such a girl as that, who cares for nothing, and nobody,
				once gets it into her head to go about among the factory people, she'll kick up more
				dust than we shall find it easy to lay again. I've been told already by one who I
				suspect wanted to put me on my guard, that this Mary Brotherton wished to have a
				little talk with Michael Armstrong. I can put two and two together as well as Miss
				Mary. She was at our cursed play last night, and I'll bet my life to a rotten egg
				that she wants to ask him what he cried for."</p>
			<p>"Likely enough, sir," replied the overlooker with a grim smile. "I heard of the
				crying, I won't say that I didn't. You may guess, Sir Matthew that it was a good
				deal talked about among the servants — and then t'other of 'em blubbering away at
				the mill, must give a pretty notion, mustn't it, sir, of your goodness to 'em?"</p>
			<p>"Say no more about it, it makes me mad!" exclaimed the knight. "One or both of 'em
				shall be sent to Deep Valley mill, Parsons, if I die for it!"</p>
			<pb n="141"/>
			<p>"There's none but 'prentices taken in at the mill in the deep hollow, Sir Matthew, if
				you mean that."</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir, I do mean that," replied Sir Matthew with a very ominous frown, "and there
				Master Michael Armstrong shall go. 'prentice or no 'prentice, or I'll give him up my
				place, and take his."</p>
			<p>"That's all, then Sir Matthew," said the overlooker, preparing to depart. "I com'd to
				put you up to the boys ingratitude, and have nothing further to say at present."</p>
			<p>"You need not trouble yourself any more about that, Mr. Parsons. I will take care of
				him," replied the knight. Whereupon Mr. Parsons made a bow, and departed.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew Dowling had already taken one tumbler of hock-and-water. He now took a
				second, and then throwing himself back in his arm-chair, indulged for several
				minutes in very deep meditation. At the end of that time it seemed as if the good
				Rhine wine had done its office, for suddenly the knight's countenance became
				animated; the heavy gloom which had rested upon it disappeared, and springing to his
				feet he rang the bell with a sort of lively jerk which showed he had some project in
				hand that he greatly relished.</p>
			<p>It was the lively Peggy who answered the summons; but though she entered almost out
				of breath from the eagerness with which she had traversed the passage which led from
				the kitchen to the study, and though she brought into immediate activity all the
					<hi>agaceries</hi> of which she was capable, a smiling nod was all she got in
				return, so eager did Sir Matthew appear to say, "Go to Miss Martha, Peggy, as fast
				as you can, and tell her to come here to me this very minute. Go, my dear, and make
				haste, there's a good girl."</p>
			<p>Peggy was disappointed and angry, for she had a great deal to tell Sir Matthew about
				Michael Armstrong's ungratefulness, and all that the servants thought and said about
				it; but the command she had received was too peremptory to be trifled with, and
				though she very nearly slammed the study door in shutting it, she failed not to
				deliver her message, which was instantly obeyed with the most dutiful alacrity by
				Martha.</p>
			<p>"Did you send Peggy for me, papa?" said she in entering.</p>
			<p>"Yes, Martha dear, I did. How are you to-day, my dear girl? I have not seen you
				before this morning. Sit down, love, sit down; I want to talk to you, Martha, I have
				got something upon my mind that vexes me, and I am going to open my heart to you
				about it."</p>
			<p>"Oh, my dear, dear papa!" returned Martha, "I should be so glad if I could be of any
				use to you!"</p>
			<p>"You can, Martha — you can be of great use and comfort to me. In the first place you
				must be my father confessor, and let me confess my faults to you, and I hope you
				will give me absolution if you can; for I really am very uncomfortable."</p>
			<p>"What <hi>can</hi> you mean, papa?"</p>
			<p> "Why, my dear, I mean that I have been foolish enough to put myself in a great pet,
				when I ought not to have done any such thing. It is always wrong to let temper get
				the better of one; but in this case it <pb n="142"/> was particularly so. You know
				the fuss that has been made about this little fellow that I have taken out of the
				factory — I do assure you, my dear girl, that I really intended to be a very kind
				friend to him. But I got so provoked at his crying upon the stage last night in that
				beautiful speech that was written for him, that I cuffed him soundly for it when he
				came off — and I am sadly afraid that I frightened the poor little fellow so
				violently that he will never feel comfortable, and at his ease with me again. You
				cannot think how this vexes me." </p>
			<p>"Oh! my dear papa, he will never remember it any more if you will please to forgive
				him." And Martha's heart bounded with joy as she spoke, to think how completely Miss
				Brotherton's opinion would be changed could she but hear her father speak thus
				amiably of what had passed.</p>
			<p>"No, Martha, no; I cannot bear to see his frightened look. And besides, my dear, I
				shall never be sure of myself — you know how hasty I am! — I should live in
				perpetual terror lest any thing should tempt me to give him a cuff. There are other
				reasons too, my dear Martha, which induce me to think that I should be doing the
				little fellow and his family infinitely more service if I apprenticed him to some
				good trade, than he could ever gain by running about Dowling Lodge."</p>
			<p>The excellent good sense of this observation struck Martha as very valuable, and she
				uttered the most cordial approbation of the wisdom and goodness from whence it
				proceeded.</p>
			<p>"I am exceedingly glad you agree with me, my dear child," proceeded Sir Matthew, "for
				I have an idea that you could be very useful in making the arrangement. Do you
				happen to know where the little boy's mother lives, my dear Martha?"</p>
			<p>"No, papa — but Michael could show me."</p>
			<p>"Then you should have no objection to pay her a visit on this business, my dear?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear no! I should like it so much!"</p>
			<p>"Very well, my love — then you shall set out immediately if you will. Or stay — it
				would perhaps be better to get you the paper first that they will have to sign. You
				must remember to tell them, Martha, that I shall undertake to pay all the fees. It
				certainly is an excellent thing for a poor family like Armstrong's, to have a boy
				'prenticed to a good trade. I trust the mother will not refuse her consent from any
				selfish notion, that she may lose the boy's help thereby, it would be really very
				wicked. You may tell her, my dear, that I shall continue to send her down nice and
				nourishing food, and that little Michael shall be taught to write, and well
				instructed every way; so she may be quite easy about him, and he will be sure to
				send her a letter every now and then." The knight concluded with a smile of
				kindness, that perfectly enchanted his daughter. "Oh! my dear, dear papa!" she said,
				"how few people there are who know you as well as I do! Let me go and look for
				Michael now, papa, shall I? I should like to go down to his mother with him at once,
				and tell her of your great goodness. The papers could be sent afterwards, you
				know."</p>
			<p> "Very well, dear, trot away then; — get your bonnet and parasol, <pb n="143"/> find
				your little squire, and then come back here to me to receive my last instructions." </p>
			<p>As soon as the happy-looking Martha had left the room the bell was again rung, and on
				this occasion answered by a footman, — the lively Peggy choosing to turn herself
				another way as soon as she heard it.</p>
			<p>"Is Parsons gone?" demanded Sir Matthew of the servant.</p>
			<p>"No, Sir Matthew, he is in the servants' hall," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"Desire him to step here directly."</p>
			<p>Though the overlooker was enjoying some very comfortable refreshment, he promptly
				obeyed the summons, and as soon as he had again entered the study, and shut the door
				behind him, his master said, "Do you know, Parsons, whether the woman Armstrong can
				read?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir, I know she can — and that's one reason why she is so outdacious about the
				workhouse and every thing. There's nothing on earth does so much mischief among the
				mill people as making scholards of 'em," said the man.</p>
			<p>"I know that well enough, who doesn't? But you may go now, I only wanted to ask you
				that one question," replied the master.</p>
			<p>Once more alone, the knight again took to meditation. Profound as was the state of
				ignorance respecting all things beyond their own wretched dwellings in which the
				operatives at that time were kept, Sir Matthew had some misgivings as to the
				possibility that the name and fame of Deep Valley mill, might have reached even
				Hoxley-lane. If it had, the sending to a woman who could read, indentures by which
				her child should become bound to that establishment till the age of twenty-one, was
				running a risk of more opposition than he wished to encounter. But he had a ready
				wit, and seldom remained long at a loss how to manage any business on which his mind
				had fixed itself. When Martha returned, therefore, he was quite ready with his last
				instructions.</p>
			<p>"Have you found the little boy, my dear?" said he mildly.</p>
			<p>"Yes, papa, he is waiting for me in the hall. Foolish little fellow! I believe he
				fears that you are very angry with him, and he looked so much alarmed that I would
				not bring him in."</p>
			<p>"Poor child! But you were quite right, my dear Martha. It is better not to harass him
				in any way. Now then, Martha, what you have got to do is this: Explain to the poor
				woman that it is my wish to keep my promise of providing for her boy; but that I am
				come to the persuasion that the apprenticing him to some respectable business will
				be better than letting him run about the place here learning nothing. You may talk
				to the little boy, you know; he is a sharp child, and I have no doubt will come to
				the same conclusion himself, if you state the thing to him properly."</p>
			<p>"I have no doubt of it, papa," answered the innocent Martha; "I will do my very best
				to make him understand it. And what trade shall I tell Mrs. Armstrong you have
				chosen for him?"</p>
			<p>"Stocking weaving, my dear, I really don't know a better; and we may be able to help
				him in that if he behaves well as he goes on."</p>
			<p>"Well then, papa, now I may go?"</p>
			<pb n="144"/>
			<p>"Yes, my dear, now you may go — and you may just tell the woman, Martha, that if she
				approves the plan, I will call upon her myself some day with the papers. A pleasant
				walk to you! Good bye."</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p>It was a very pleasant walk, for Martha was delighted with her companion. She opened
				to him kindly and clearly the plan for his being put apprentice to a respectable
				trade, and pointed out to his young but quick capacity the advantage this would give
				him in after life, and the power he might hope to possess, if he behaved well, of
				providing for his mother and brother.</p>
			<p>"'Tis that what I should like best of all things," said Michael. "Because, please
				ma'am, I know I must help 'em, as they beant neither of 'em so strong as I be."</p>
			<p>"You are a good boy, Michael, for thinking of them so much as you do. That is the
				reason I take notice of you, and love you."</p>
			<p>The little fellow nestled closer to her side, as they walked on, and raising the hand
				that held his, he laid it upon his shoulder, and pressed his cheek upon it with very
				endearing fondness.</p>
			<p>"What an affectionate little heart it is!" thought Martha, "and how very happy I
				shall be if I can help to get this business settled for him!"</p>
			<p>Of course Miss Martha Dowling had never been in Hoxley-lane before; and
				notwithstanding her having so agreeable a companion, she speedily became aware that
				the region was as unpleasant as it was new.</p>
			<p>"Is this the only road, my dear boy, by which we can get to your mother's house?"
				said she, almost mechanically enveloping her offended nose, in her
				pocket-handkerchief.</p>
			<p>"It is here that we lives, please ma'am," said the child, pulling her onwards.</p>
			<p>"How very foolish of me!" thought Martha, withdrawing her handkerchief, "of course
				poor people live in poor houses. But I cannot think why the place should smell
				so!"</p>
			<p>No 12 was however soon reached, and the young lady carefully led by her little
				attendant through the largest gap in the hedge to the outer door of the back
				kitchen, in order that she might escape Mrs. Sykes's crowded front one.</p>
			<p>"Go in first, Michael, and tell your mother that I am coming," said the considerate
				Martha. The child did so, but in this case there was no means for preparation, and
				having named the unexpected visitant and given his mother a hasty kiss, he returned
				before Martha had recovered the sort of shock which the dirty and desolate spot on
				which she stood had occasioned.</p>
			<p> In truth no person unaccustomed to approach the dwellings of the operatives in the
				towns of the manufacturing districts, can fail to be startled at the first near
				sight of them. In the very poorest agricultural village, the cottages which shelter
				its labourers have the pure untainted air of heaven to blow around their humble
				roofs; but where forests of tall bare chimneys, belching eternal clouds of smoke
				rear their unsightly shafts towards the sky, in lieu of verdant air-refreshing <pb n="145"/> trees, the black tint of the loathsome factory seems to rest upon
				every object near it. The walls are black, the fences are black, the window-panes
				(when there are any) are all veiled in black. No domestic animal that pertinaciously
				exists within their tainted purlieus, but wears the same dark hue; and perhaps there
				is no condition of human life so significantly surrounded by types of its own
				wretchedness as this. </p>
			<p>Martha Dowling shuddered as she looked around her; and when Michael returned to lead
				her in, she felt half afraid of crossing the gloomy threshold.</p>
			<p>But the widow Armstrong was, as usual, less dirty in her abject misery than, perhaps,
				any other inhabitant of Hoxley-lane, or its immediate neighbourhood, and the mild
				countenance and gentle voice with which she replied to the young lady's salutation
				removed all her scruples, and she seated herself in the chair placed for her by
				Michael, with the best disposition in the world to improve the acquaintance.</p>
			<p>"I hope you are getting better, Mrs. Armstrong?" said Martha, in that tone of genuine
				female softness which it is so impossible to mistake, "and that you don't miss
				little Michael as much as you did at first."</p>
			<p>"You are very kind, ma'am, to take the trouble of coming to such a place as this,"
				replied the poor woman, in a voice that indicated something like surprise. Upon
				which Michael, who had stationed himself near enough to enable him to slip his
				little hand into hers, said, with a tolerably expressive emphasis — "This is Miss
				Martha, mother."</p>
			<p>"I wish, ma'am, I had strength and power to thank you as I ought, for all your
				condescending kindness to my poor boy!" said the widow, earnestly. "I never see him,
				that he has not some fresh story to tell me of your goodness to him. He can read a
				chapter in the Bible now as well as any boy of his age need to do. And oh! Miss —
				This is all owing to you — for never could he have given his time to it in the
				factory."</p>
			<p>"There is more praise due to him than to me, Mrs. Armstrong, I assure you. He is a
				very good boy at learning, and minds every word that is said to him. I suppose he
				has shown you his copy-book too, hasn't he? I never saw a child that had so good a
				notion of writing."</p>
			<p>"He was always a quick boy, Miss — but never can he be thankful enough to you for
				teaching him how to put his quickness to profit. It will be the making of him."</p>
			<p> "I am very glad to hear you speak so earnestly about his learning, because that
				makes me think that you will be pleased at hearing the business I am come upon. My
				papa, who is very" — here poor Martha stopped short. She was going to add — "
					<hi>kind to little Michael</hi> ," but her honest heart would not let her
				pronounce the words; so she changed the phrase, and went on with "very desirous of
				being really useful to Michael, has commissioned me, Mrs. Armstrong, to ask you if
				you do not think it would be more profitable and advantageous to <pb n="146"/> him
				to be apprenticed to some good trade, the stocking-weaving for instance, than to run
				about our house any longer? Papa says, he fears it will give him habits of idleness
				which he may be the worse for all his life — and that would be quite contrary to his
				wishes, which have always been that he should benefit all his life long, by his good
				behaviour about the cow." </p>
			<p>Mrs. Armstrong's eyes which had been fixed on the countenance of Martha, every line
				of which spoke of truth and sincerity, fell upon the work she held in her hand as
				these words were uttered — and for a moment she made no answer. But feeling,
				perhaps, that this was both ungrateful and ungracious to her visiter, she looked up
				again and said, "I am sure, ma'am, we can never thank you enough for all your
				kindness."</p>
			<p>There was the slightest emphasis in the world upon the word " <hi>you</hi> ," but it
				was enough to heighten the colour of Martha, and for a moment she both felt and
				looked displeased.</p>
			<p>"My power, of myself, to befriend your boy, Mrs. Armstrong, is very little, I assure
				you," she said. "Of course it is natural that I should take more notice of him than
				a person like my father can, who has so many other things to attend to; but it is to
				his generosity and benevolence that you must look for any lasting advantage you may
				hope to gain for him."</p>
			<p>"Indeed, ma'am, I would be happy to take your advice in the disposal of him any way;
				for I can't mistake your kindness, or your power to judge what is best, which of
				course must be greater than mine, notwithstanding your young age — and if Michael
				likes it, and you think it best, ma'am."</p>
			<p>Martha saw that the mother's fear of having her boy parted from her, was combating
				the wiser hope for his future advantage; and fully conscious that the continuing his
				present mode of life could only be productive of mortification, she boldly answered
				this appeal, and in the confiding innocence of her heart ventured to say, "Perhaps,
				in this case, girl as I am, my judgment <hi>may</hi> be better than yours, Mrs.
				Armstrong. I do not think it would be good or pleasant for Michael in any way, to
				continue living at the Lodge as he does at present; and I do think, that if put to a
				respectable trade, he may not only provide for himself, but be a help and comfort to
				you and his brother likewise. This is my opinion, certainly, and now ask his. He is
				still younger than me, to be sure, poor little fellow, and yet I think you ought to
				listen to his opinion."</p>
			<p>"Well, Mike dear," said the widow, turning her head towards the child, "you hear what
				the young lady says; speak up, my dear, and tell us what you think about it."</p>
			<p>"I be ready to go, mother, if she bids me, and you like it," replied the boy.</p>
			<p> "You can judge, ma'am, that he knows his duty. That is just like him. From the time
				he was able to speak, dear creature, it was always the same — gentle, good, and
				reasonable. I won't say but what the parting with him will be a sore trial to me,
				but God forbid that I should set the wishes of my worn-out life against the hopes of
				his young one. <pb n="147"/> How far away is it Miss, do you happen to know where
				the master stocking-weaver bides, as he's to go to?" </p>
			<p>Martha confessed her ignorance on this point; but added, that though she should be
				sorry to hear it was too far off for him occasionally to come home and pay her a
				visit, she should be more sorry still, were he to be placed in the town of Ashleigh.
				"It would be only putting him for ever in the way of temptation, Mrs. Armstrong,"
				said she; "and I am sure you are too sensible a woman, to wish that he should be
				where the doing his duty was likely to be a pain to him."</p>
			<p>"Indeed, and that I would," said the poor woman, earnestly. "'Tis the seeing their
				poor young faces for ever so sad and care-worn, that is the worst trial of all."</p>
			<p>"How true is what my dear father says about the factory people," thought Martha —
				"how wonderfully they do all hate work!"</p>
			<p>This conviction of their epidemic idleness, however, in no degree chilled the good
				girl's desire at once to perform her father's will, and benefit a very interesting,
				though not, as she believed, a very industrious mother and son. So deeming it best
				to enter into no further discussion, but to accept the consent uttered by both as
				final and conclusive, she rose, and smiling good-humouredly at Michael said,</p>
			<p>"Now you have taught me the way here, I think I shall be able to get back again by
				myself; and I dare say Michael, that you and your mother will like to have a little
				conversation together about this new plan for you. But remember, dear, that you are
				home by five o'clock to read your lesson and show me your copy-book, we were
				interrupted this morning you know." Then leaving in the poor widow's hand a welcome
				token of her visit, and promising that she would either bring or send the papers
				necessary for her to sign, before long, the excellent Martha Dowling departed, after
				having most innocently, but most effectually, lent her aid to the perpetration of as
				hateful a crime, as the black heart of long-hardened depravity could devise.</p>
			<p>Having waited till the figure of the young lady had passed across the little window,
				the widow Armstrong pulled her boy towards her, and gave him a mother's kiss.</p>
			<p>"To be sure thee dost look all the better, my Mike, for good food, and fine clothing.
				But I shan't be satisfied, unless you tell me that you like all these new favours
				that they are going to confer upon you."</p>
			<p>"I like to go, mother, very much," replied Michael, stoutly.</p>
			<p>"Thank God! then, my darling — you are provided for," she rejoined with a deep sigh.
				"I have known a many stocking-weavers, Mike, exceeding well to do, and there was
				never one of them, I'll answer for it, that had a better will to work, and to do his
				duty, than you have — so I have no right to doubt but what you will do well, and I
				don't doubt it. But 'tis the parting with thee, my dear, dear child! — Oh! Mike, you
				have been a comfort to me ever since you was born — and how do I know, if — "</p>
			<p> "Mother!" cried the boy, interrupting her, "I'll be a comfort to you still. I'll
				tell you what I've got in my head to do, and just see <pb n="148"/> if it is not a
				good plan. I mean to be the very best boy that ever my master had, and when I've
				gone on working with him a bit, two or three months, perhaps, mother, — time enough
				for him really to find out that I am a good boy, — I will tell him all about you and
				Teddy, and make him understand that if he wants to keep me in good heart to work, he
				must let me trudge away home to pass a Sunday now and then with you two. I don't
				think he'll be able to say no, mother, when I tell him about Teddy's poor legs, and
				all you have done for us both, lying a-bed here." </p>
			<p>Mrs. Armstrong again kissed her boy, and after gazing at him with a look in which
				pride and pleasure were strangely blended with anguish, she said, "I do think you'll
				make your way, Michael — for you are a good boy, a very good boy. But I don't know
				how poor Edward will take it."</p>
			<p>"That's the worst part of it, mother," replied the little fellow, beginning to cry.
				"Poor Teddy does look so very happy of a night when he sees me pop round the corner
				upon him, as he comes out of the factory! — But then I shall be able to help him,
				mother, all the better by and by. And when I come home of a Sunday, mother, I must
				teach him to write, and then think how beautiful to have a letter from one another!
				I know who'll give me a slate for Teddy, and me too, to learn with, and that's Miss
				Martha. And I shan't mind asking her, not the least, because she knows I am going
				away. And do you know, mother, I've got another notion, and that's no bad comfort
				neither. I should not a bit wonder, if Miss Martha was to turn out a right good
				friend to you and Teddy, when I am gone."</p>
			<p>And so the little fellow ran on — each hopeful word he uttered begetting a new hope,
				till, by the time the hour of departure arrived, his poor mother had at least the
				comfort of believing that the prospect opening before him, was one that he looked
				upon with much less of pain than pleasure.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Martha found her way safely home, and gave her father such an account of
				the result of her mission, as induced him to give her a kiss, and declare that if
				she was not the handsomest of the family, she was out-and-out the most useful.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XIV. </head>
			<p>MARY BROTHERTON CONTINUES SICK IN HEART AND MIND — BUT IS ROUSED AND CHEERED BY HER
				OWN STEADFAST WILL — AN O'ER TRUE TALE.</p>
			<p>
				It was not till the second dinner-bell had rung, that Mrs. Tremlett
				ventured to seek Mary in her chamber.</p>
			<p> The worthy woman was perfectly aware that the naturally strong <pb n="149"/>
				feelings of her young mistress had been violently affected by the scene they had
				witnessed, and though far perhaps from comprehending the effect it had produced on
				her mind, she was conscious that she should do no good by obtruding herself
				uncalled-for upon her retirement. </p>
			<p>But when the signal that always brought them together had passed unheeded, she became
				uneasy, and availing herself of the privilege that long and well-requited affection
				gave, she knocked at her door and called upon her name.</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton answered the summons immediately; but her withdrawing the bolt of her
				door, as well as the unchanged appearance of her dress, showed that she had not been
				occupied in preparing for dinner.</p>
			<p>"You are not aware how late it is, my dear child. The second dinner-bell has rung!"
				said Mrs. Tremlett looking anxiously in her pale face.</p>
			<p>"Has it?" replied the young lady; "indeed, I beg your pardon — but I will not keep
				you waiting, I will not dress to-day if you will excuse it."</p>
			<p>"No, no, my dear, that won't do. Never mind about the dinner I will tell them to take
				it out again."</p>
			<p>"Indeed I do not wish to dress," said Mary languidly. "Morgan will tease me by asking
				what dress I choose to wear and fifty questions besides. Let me go down as I am,
				nurse Tremlett."</p>
			<p>"You shan't have Morgan at all dear. The dressing will refresh you my darling child;
				and it won't be the first time Mary, that I have done all that you wanted in that
				way. There — just sit down on the sofa for one minute, and I will speak about the
				dinner, and be back again."</p>
			<p>It was very passively that Mary did as she was bid, and without another word of
				remonstrance sat down and awaited the return of her old friend. She was indeed
				completely exhausted, the scene she had witnessed had not touched only, it had wrung
				her heart; and the hours she had passed since, were not such as to bring her spirits
				back to their ordinary tone. It was not alone, the melancholy spectacle of a
				fellow-creature passing from life to death, which had thus strongly affected her —
				it was the frightful degradation of the group of human beings who had gazed upon it
				with her. It was the horrible recollection of the dying woman's statement respecting
				the lacerated flesh of her child — and it was the filth, the misery, the famine, and
				the vice that she had been warned of, and had seen, which had set her powerful,
				healthy, unprejudiced, and unselfish mind, to meditate upon the state of things
				which had produced it.</p>
			<p> It was hardly possible for any one to be more profoundly ignorant upon the subject
				which had thus seized upon her heart, than was Mary Brotherton. On the question of
				negro slavery she had from her very earliest infancy heard a great deal, for her
				father was an anti-(black)-slavery man, who subscribed to the African society, and
				the missionary fund; drank Mr. Wilberforce's health after dinner whenever he had
				company at his table; and while his own mills daily sent millions of groans to be
				registered in heaven from joyless young hearts <pb n="150"/> and aching infant
				limbs, he rarely failed to despatch with nearly equal regularity (all booked for the
				same region) a plentiful portion of benevolent lamentations over the sable sons of
				Africa, all uttered comfortably from a soft arm-chair, while digestion was gently
				going on, and his well-fed person in a state of the most perfect enjoyment. On the
				slavery question therefore Mary really knew a great deal, and felt concerning it as
				every true Christian must feel. But as to every thing concerning the nature of the
				labour performed in the factories by whose chimneys her pleasant park was surrounded
				— the age, sex, or condition, of the labourers — the proportion of their daily
				existence devoted to toil — the degree of care bestowed on their immortal souls — or
				the quantum of enjoyment permitted to them by their earthly masters, while awaiting
				a summons to the presence of their heavenly one — of all this Mary Brotherton was as
				ignorant as the sleek lapdog that dozed upon her hearth-rug. But this
				carefully-adjusted cloud was now passing away from her intellect for ever. If "Where
				ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise," that folly had seized upon her; for no
				longer was she destined to taste the doubtful joy of luxury that had never looked
				upon the seamy side of existence, or dreamed that the means that supplied its
				exquisite, yet almost unnoted refinements, were earned by the agony of labouring
				infants. But though this, worse than fools paradise, was thus closed upon her for
				ever, she felt a power and energy of purpose awaked within her heart, that she
				thanked God upon her bended knees for giving, though she trembled as she received
				it. And never did sainted nun breathe purer or more earnest vows of self-devotion to
				heaven, than did this ardent-spirited girl to the examination, and, if possible, to
				the relief of the misery she had at length learned to know existed round her. </p>
			<p>But like most other persons when occupied by a really profound emotion, Mary felt no
				inclination to talk about it. She had not indeed the slightest intention to conceal
				any thing she did from Mrs. Tremlett, but on the contrary hoped eventually to gain
				much assistance from her strong practical good sense; but she could not discuss, she
				could not reason, she could not prate about it now, and she went through the
				business of the dinner-table so tranquilly, that her watchful companion felt
				rejoiced, though a little surprised, at her recovered composure.</p>
			<p>Soon after they retired from table, Mary proposed a walk in the grounds, and as they
				wandered together through the richly-scented flower-garden, and then seated
				themselves where the cool breeze of evening brought the tempered fragrance to their
				senses more delightfully still, the feverish feeling of tightness across her
				forehead, seemed to relax, and as if to apologise for the silent fit that had seized
				her, Mary looked kindly into the face of her old friend, and then bent forward and
				kissed her.</p>
			<p>"Bless you, my dear love! you feel better now, don't you?" said the affectionate old
				woman.</p>
			<pb n="151"/>
			<p>"Yes, dear nurse — much better. The air is delicious to-night."</p>
			<p>"It was too much for you, my dear child, that dreadful scene this morning! My dear
				Miss Brotherton you must be reasonable, indeed you must, or instead of making me the
				very happiest being in the world as you do now, my life will become one of continual
				terror and alarm. You can do no good, my dear, in putting yourself in such places as
				we were in to-day."</p>
			<p>Mary reflected for a moment before she answered her, and then said, "Are you quite
				sure, nurse Tremlett that a young woman without any natural ties whatever, and with
				a fortune so large as mine, can do no good by making themselves acquainted with the
				condition of their poor neighbours?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! no, Miss Mary dear, I never said that. You do a great deal of good by putting
				the gardener's, and under-gardener's children to school; and by all the help you
				give them and every body else that works about the place, and I dearly love to see
				you do it, and I have no doubt in the world, that it keeps many from sending their
				children to the mills, and it will bring a blessing upon your head, my dear. But
				that's nothing to do with poking yourself into such a place as you got into to-day.
				You never heard any thing so dreadful as what Sir Matthew Dowling was telling me
				about them, before you came out the first time."</p>
			<p>Mary shuddered, as she heard his name.</p>
			<p>"You will promise me dear, won't you, never to go to such a horrid place again,"
				resumed the old woman.</p>
			<p>"We will not talk about that now, my dear Mrs. Tremlett, I want you to tell me what
				you think I could do that would be most useful for those poor young girls. I know
				what it is to lose a mother, dear nurse, and it makes me feel for them."</p>
			<p>"God bless your kind heart, my dear! That is just like you, and I wish with all my
				heart and soul, that you lived somewhere among the farming people, for there you
				would have some reward for your charity. But God help me! If one half of what Sir
				Matthew told me is true, these horrid girls are worse than it is decent to tell you,
				and the father's as bad."</p>
			<p>"But don't you think my good friend, considering that I am more than come to years of
				discretion, and that you are a good deal older still, don't you think it might be as
				well for us, in a case of such importance as this, to see and judge for ourselves,
				instead of taking Sir Matthew Dowling's word for it?" said the heiress, while a
				slight frown contracted her brow.</p>
			<p>"Why yes, Miss Mary — only it is so difficult to come at the truth," replied Mrs.
				Tremlett.</p>
			<p>"Surely there is one truth that it is easy enough to come at — I suppose you have no
				doubt upon your mind that these people are in dreadful distress?"</p>
			<p>"Wicked people almost always are, Miss Mary."</p>
			<p> "Then it is my duty Mrs. Tremlett," replied Mary almost sternly, "to endeavour, at
				least in the case of such very young people, to <pb n="152"/> amend, or prevent
				their wickedness. It would be a frightful sin — worse in me, burdened as I feel
				myself with riches earned by the labour of such miserable little creatures as those
				whom we saw to-day — if I should look upon such utter destitution, let it be mixed
				up with what frailty it may, and pass along on the other side. I will not do it,
				Mrs. Tremlett, so never ask it more. At present all I know is, that I have seen
				misery. Its cause I have yet to learn — This may be the work of time, and I do not
				mean to wait till I have acquired such knowledge before I relieve the want and woe I
				have witnessed. I left word that the eldest girl was to come up to me. She will
				hardly delay doing so, poor creature, therefore I must again postpone my intended
				visit to Hoxley-lane, for I will not go out to-morrow till I have seen her." </p>
			<p>All this was very contrary to Mrs. Tremlett's judgment, for she had a very natural
				dread lest the warm heart of her young charge, should be imposed upon by the
				designing and depraved. Nevertheless there was a feeling of respect that came upon
				her involuntarily, and as it were unawares, as she listened to the firmly-spoken
				purpose of the young girl whom as yet she could hardly persuade herself was more
				than a child.</p>
			<p>In pursuance of the resolution thus declared, Miss Brotherton did not stir from home
				during the whole of the following day. Lady Clarissa Shrimpton, Mrs. Gabberly, and
				one or two more distant neighbours called, but she was denied to them all, from the
				fear that her anticipated interview with Sophy Drake, might be interrupted. But the
				precaution was unnecessary; the long morning wore away without the girl's making her
				appearance, and it was not till past eight o'clock in the evening, that a servant
				entered the drawing-room, and informed Miss Brotherton that a very dirty girl and
				two little children were at the gate, who said she had given them orders to
				call.</p>
			<p>"It is very true," replied the young lady. "These are the people I told you to let
				in." The man retired in silence, but paid himself for his forbearance by the
				vehemence of his wondering commentary in the servants' hall.</p>
			<p>Mary Brotherton was sitting at an open window, with the last light of evening falling
				upon her and the volume she held in her hand.</p>
			<p>She had been making what proved but an idle effort to read, even when that light was
				stronger; but now, the volume hung listlessly from her hand, while her eyes, fixed
				on the brightly tinted vapours in the west, seemed to look athwart them, and like
				the worthy gentleman on the platform before Tilbury Fort, to gaze on many things,
				that were " <hi>not yet in sight</hi> ." Mrs. Tremlett, with the happy indifference
				to the increasing twilight peculiar to the sisterhood of knitters, continued at
				another window to manoeuvre her bright weapons, and vary the successive fronts of
				her phalanx with no louder note of command, than was occasionally produced by the
				gentle clicking of her needles against each other. It was nearly an hour since a
				word had been exchanged between them, but now as the footman left the room, Mary
				turned towards her, and said — "This is poor Sophy, Mrs. Tremlett. Come and sit near
				me, will you? I want you to hear all she says."</p>
			<p> Her old friend moved her place accordingly, and had just seated <pb n="153"/>
				herself by the side of Miss Brotherton when the door again opened, and Sophy Drake,
				leading a little sister in each hand, entered the drawing-room. </p>
			<p>It required no force of contrast to render the miserable, squalid, unhealthy
				appearance of these poor girls most painfully striking; if it had, the elegant
				apartment into which they now entered would have furnished it. Mary's heart smote
				her as she gazed upon them. "So young — so pretty too!" thought she, "and yet so
				painful to look upon!"</p>
			<p>The eldest of the three looked languid, weary, spirit-broken, and inanimate, hardly
				throwing a glance at the novel objects around her, and looking more fit to lie down
				and rest the aching limbs she slowly dragged along, than to indulge any feeling of
				curiosity. The little ones had the same unsteady tired gait, but they looked up with
				an expression of wonder, and almost of awe, on every object as they passed
				along."</p>
			<p>"How are you all, my poor girls?" said Mary kindly, as they drew near to her. The
				eldest girl dropped a courtesy but made no audible reply.</p>
			<p>"It is so sad and hopeless a grief to lose a mother," continued Miss Brotherton,
				"that I can say not one word to check your grief. But if there is any thing that I
				can do to make you more comfortable, I shall be glad to do it. You seem all of you
				greatly in want of clothes. How comes that, when so many of the family work, and get
				wages?"</p>
			<p>"The wages isn't enough to buy us bread, ma'am," replied the eldest girl, and help
				pay lodging rent.</p>
			<p>This statement seemed so very incredible, that Mary felt a painful conviction that
				the young creature before her was not speaking truth. She remained silent for a
				minute or two, and then said, "I suppose when you say bread, you mean food of all
				kinds? — and tea, and sugar, and butter, and so on?" said Mary.</p>
			<p>"I have not had the taste of meat in my mouth for above these two years," replied
				Sophy colouring, and in a voice that seemed to indicate something like indignation —
				"and as to sugar in our tea, or butter on our bread, no factory child is brought up
				to it."</p>
			<p>Mary coloured too. She longed to get accurate information respecting their manner of
				living, and the reasons why incessant labour failed to supply the necessaries of
				life; but she knew not well how to set about it.</p>
			<p>"Do not be angry with me, Sophy," said she, "if I ask questions that seem unfeeling
				and very ignorant. I really know little or nothing about the manner in which poor
				people live, and I want to know. Not merely from curiosity, but because I should
				like to help them if I could."</p>
			<p>"And God knows we want help bad enough, ma'am," replied the girl, while tears started
				to her eyes. "Father has got the money you gave yesterday, and we shall never hear
				any more of that."</p>
			<p>"Is he a bad father to you then?"</p>
			<pb n="154"/>
			<p>"Not bad to beat us. But he drinks terrible."</p>
			<p>"Then I suppose his wages go partly in that?"</p>
			<p>"His wages, and our'n too, ma'am. He baint always able to get work. The old hands are
				often out, and then in course he takes our'n."</p>
			<p>"Then if he was a temperate, steady man, you would do a great deal better?"</p>
			<p>"In course we should, ma'am. But mother said he took to it, as most of the others do
				in all the mills, on account of hating to come home so, when we young ones comes in
				from work. I have heard mother say that father cried when I, that was the biggest,
				com'd home first beaten and bruised with the strap and the billy-roller."</p>
			<p>"What <hi>is</hi> the billy-roller, Sophy," inquired Miss Brotherton, in an accent
				denoting considerable curiosity.</p>
			<p>"It's a long stout stick, ma'am, that's used often and often to beat the little ones
				employed in the mills when their strength fails — when they fall asleep, or stand
				still for a minute."</p>
			<p>"Do you mean, that the children work till they are so tired as to fall asleep
				standing?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am. Dozens and dozens of 'em every day in the year except Sundays, is
				strapped, and kicked, and banged by the billy-roller, because they falls
				asleep."</p>
			<p>"But, surely, parents are greatly to blame, to let children young enough for that, go
				to work at all?"</p>
			<p>"They must just starve, ma'am, if they didn't," replied the girl.</p>
			<p>"How many years have you worked in the factory yourself, Sophy?"</p>
			<p>"Just twelve, ma'am, this last spring."</p>
			<p>"And how old are you?"</p>
			<p>"Seventeen, ma'am."</p>
			<p>"Twelve from seventeen? — You mean to say that you began to work at the factory when
				you were five years old?" said Mary, with some appearance of incredulity.</p>
			<p>"I was five years and three months, ma'am," answered the girl firmly.</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton looked at Mrs. Tremlett, but perceived no appearance of incredulity
				on her countenance. "Is this possible, Mrs. Tremlett?" said she.</p>
			<p>"Yes, my dear, I believe that it is very common," replied the old woman. "I have
				often heard it spoken of among the servants."</p>
			<p>"Have you ever been at school, Sophy?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am. Afore father changed his mill and took work under Sir Matthew we all —
				father, mother, Grace, Dick, and all, worked for the great Quaker gentleman, Joseph
				Tell, and he had a school in the factory for Sundays."</p>
			<p>"And you learnt to read there of course?"</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am, I didn't;" replied the girl, shaking her head.</p>
			<p>"Whose fault was that, my dear? — Surely if you were put to school, you ought to have
				learnt to read!"</p>
			<pb n="155"/>
			<p>"I couldn't, ma'am, I couldn't — and it was not my fault neither," replied the girl
				with considerable agitation.</p>
			<p>"We was often and often kept going till twelve o'clock on a Saturday night, and when
				the Sunday comed we couldn't sit down upon the bench, neither Grace, nor Dick, nor
				I, without falling dead asleep. 'Twas the only right good sleep we had, that before
				Sundays I mean, 'cause father was always obligated to wake us every other morning
				afore five o'clock, summer and winter, and earlier than that too, when we worked
				night-work. So keeping our eyes open Sundays wasn't possible, 'cause they didn't
				strap us."</p>
			<p>"Then there is not one of you can read?"</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am, not one."</p>
			<p>"Can your father read?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am, he can. That is he could, he says, when he was younger, but he has
				almost forgot now. He says, in his young days, the machinery improvements was
				nothing like what they be now, and that the piecer children hadn't not half so far
				or so fast to walk as they have now, and he learnt to read of his own mother when he
				comed home at nights."</p>
			<p>"And why doesn't he do the same for his children, as his mother did for him?" said
				Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Because we couldn't keep our eyes open for two minutes together when we comes home
				at night. I have seen poor mother, as is dead and gone, lay little Becky here, down
				upon the bundle of straw that she and I sleeps upon, 'cause she couldn't keep up to
				eat her supper when she comed from the mill — and I have seen her put the sopped
				bread in her mouth when she was so dead asleep, that she couldn't get her to swallow
				it — and how could she or the rest of us learn to read, ma'am?"</p>
			<p>Mary made no reply, but sat for a moment or two, with her eyes fixed on the ground,
				in very painful uncertainty as to what she could say or do, that could be of
				effectual service to the miserable group before her. She felt, that though poor
				Sophy might perhaps be telling nothing but the truth in this dismal description of
				her wretched family, it was not from her that any general information could be
				obtained. It was, as she thought, utterly impossible that it could apply to the
				hundreds of thousands whom she had heard it stated, as a matter of national pride,
				by some of her rich neighbours, were employed in the factories of England and
				Scotland. A moment's thought sufficed to convince her (as it has done multitudes of
				amiable-minded ladies and gentlemen besides), that it was perfectly impossible such
				horrors could exist on the glorious soil of Britain, unless indeed, as in the case
				before her, the unhappy drunkenness of the father plunged his helpless family into a
				degree of poverty, which nothing, perhaps, but the unnatural degree of labour
				described by this poor motherless girl, could avert.</p>
			<p> "I must clothe them all," thought she, "and put the little ones to school. Perhaps,
				too, I may find a place in my own kitchen for poor Sophy. But as to learning from
				her any thing that can be depended <pb n="156"/> upon respecting the system by which
				the factory labour is regulated, that is quite hopeless." </p>
			<p>She felt, however, that the weary-looking group ought not to return empty-handed
				after their walk, with no reward for it but her promises; and turning to Mrs.
				Tremlett, asked her in a half whisper what she could give them, that might be made
				immediately useful in the way of clothing; their garments being in a condition that
				it was painful to her to behold.</p>
			<p>"You might give them that piece of dark cotton, my dear, that you bought the other
				day for the coachman's children. There is no great hurry you know about them, for
				they are not to go to school till next month."</p>
			<p>"Very true. — It is just the thing," replied Mary; and having rung the bell and
				ordered her maid to appear, she gave orders to have it brought to her.</p>
			<p>"I do not exactly know how much there is of it, Sophy," said she, putting it into her
				hand, "but enough, I think, for one or two of you, and I will get more of the same
				sort when next I go to Ashleigh."</p>
			<p>Sophy took it with a courtesy; but having held it for a moment said, "Please, ma'am,
				this won't be no use to me, unless I may pawn part to get the rest made."</p>
			<p>"Can you not make a gown for yourself and your sisters, my good girl?" demanded
				Mary.</p>
			<p>"Please, ma'am, I never was learnt to sew," replied the girl, blushing.</p>
			<p>More convinced than ever, that her first effort to assist the poor operatives, had
				led her by an unlucky chance into a family, whose unthrifty habits made it almost
				hopeless to attempt doing them any essential service, Mary drew forth her purse, and
				giving half-a-crown to each of them, took the useless material back, saying, "I will
				send you some more decent clothes to wear, Sophy — and then we must think what
				further can be done for you and these poor little ones. But, indeed, my dear girl, I
				greatly fear that unless your habits are improved, and that you can be taught to use
				your needle like all other decent young women, in making and mending what is given
				you, it will be impossible for me, or for any one to do you much good."</p>
			<p>Poor Sophy Drake looked both sorry and ashamed as she listened to this reproof, — but
				she attempted not to answer it, and again courtesying as she received the money, she
				turned away without again speaking, and left the room.</p>
			<p>"This is very, very dreadful! nurse Tremlett," said Mary, as soon as they were alone.
				"I could not have believed that it was possible in such a country as England, to
				find human beings in a state of such degraded ignorance as that poor girl. Did you
				ever meet with any thing like it before?"</p>
			<p> "I can't say, Miss Mary, that I ever before came within reach of hearing a
				factory-girl speak so much as I have heard to-day. But I can't pretend to say that I
				am a bit surprised. I told you, my dear, from <pb n="157"/> the beginning, that you
				would only get yourself into trouble, and do no good. From the very first of my
				coming to this country, which was but a month before I came to live with your mamma,
				I always heard the same history of the factory folks. And you know, my dear, what
				every body says, must be true." </p>
			<p>Mary, as she listened to this, looked harassed, puzzled, and wretched. "But is it not
				something unheard of in the history of the world," said she, "that thousands and
				hundreds of thousands of persons should exist, all labouring, young and old, with
				unceasing industry to support themselves, and that this their painful labour should
				subject them to such habits of inevitable ignorance and degradation, that all decent
				and respectable persons must be taught to shun them?"</p>
			<p>"It does seem very hard upon them, my dear, to be sure," replied her companion; "but
				as to <hi>why</hi> it is so, I am sure it is impossible for us to guess. It must be
				partly their own faults of course; but at any rate, my dear, I wish you would not go
				on, working yourself up so. I can't bear to see you, Miss Mary, looking vexed and
				miserable for what you can't help the least bit in the world. And besides, my dear,
				I must say, that it is nowise right for a young lady like you to run the risk of
				getting near very bad people indeed, whose ways I don't like to talk to you about. I
				know you can't abide Sir Matthew Dowling, and I can't say I ever saw or heard of
				much to like in him; but for all that, there is not any good that I can see in
				disbelieving what he told us about these very people. He must know more about them
				than we can, and it was quite shocking I do assure you, Miss Mary, the things he
				told me. A great deal too bad to repeat, I promise you."</p>
			<p>Mary burst into tears. "I am very unhappy, Mrs. Tremlett," said she, "and it is not
				putting faith in Sir Matthew Dowling that can make me less so. That I may be led to
				do many things from my great ignorance, which were I better informed I should not
				do, is very likely; and it is therefore my duty to obtain information upon this
				tremendous subject as speedily as possible. Would to God, my good friend, that you
				could give it me! but as you cannot, we will cease to speculate together upon what
				we neither of us understand. I am sorry that our awful adventure yesterday,
				prevented my purposed visit to the poor woman in Hoxley-lane. We both agreed, you
				know, that I could get no harm there; and I have an object in view in making that
				visit that I am sorry to have delayed. We will go there to-morrow, nurse Tremlett, —
				and so early in the morning, as to run no risk of meeting any of the fine folks who
				love to show themselves on the Ashleigh road."</p>
			<p>Mary Brotherton did go early the following morning to Hoxley-lane. But her visit was
				too late, by exactly twenty-four hours.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XV. </head>
			<p>A TETE-A-TETE WALK — LIVELY IF NOT INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION — THE RICH VISITING THE
				POOR — MISPLACED CONFIDENCE — INNOCENT SIN.</p>
			<p>
				The fashionable and luxurious Sir Matthew Dowling was not usually
				an early riser, but on the morning of the day which followed Martha's visit to
				Hoxley-lane, he almost outdid the lark. His attorney having been sent for from
				Ashleigh with all speed within an hour after he had received his daughter's report,
				all things regarding the procuring indentures had been made easy, and he found
				himself when he waked in the morning, in every sense ready for action.</p>
			<p>Great, and very awful is the power of wealth in a bad man's hands; for scarcely is
				there any barrier which the law can raise for the protection of those who have it
				not, sufficiently strong to save them at all times and seasons, from the aggressions
				of those who have it. How Mr. Cantabury, the attorney of Sir Matthew Dowling,
				contrived to to get his part of the business executed so speedily, it would be
				difficult to say; but certain it is, that considerably before the knight's usual
				hour of breakfast on the following morning this active friend and agent, arrived at
				the lodge with documents, which only wanted the signature of the parties concerned,
				to render them of sufficient power to bind little Michael during the next eleven
				years of his life as apprentice to Mr. Elgood Sharpton, <hi>for the purpose of
					learning the business of a stocking-weaver</hi> .</p>
			<p>The name of Deep Valley, by which Mr. Elgood Sharpton's factory was universally
				known, was not mentioned, but instead of this he was described as Elgood Sharpton
				Esq., of Thistledown House, Derbyshire, a designation most satisfactorily proving
				his honourable station, and, of course, his high respectability.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew perused the document, smiled, nodded his approval, replaced the red tape
				with which it had been tied, and lodged it in his coat-pocket, saying kindly to the
				judicious attorney as he did so, "Cantabury! we must get you made coroner at the
				next vacancy — or if we miss that, something or other else that may suit you, my
				good fellow. You deserve to be taken care of, and you shall."</p>
			<p>Mr. Cantabury expressed his gratitude and departed; whereupon Martha was again
				summoned to the presence of her father.</p>
			<p>"What a capital good girl you are, Martha," said the knight, affectionately patting
				her cheek, "always up and about before any of the rest are out of their beds — I
				tell you what, Martha, you and I will have our breakfast comfortably together
				without waiting for any of them, and then I will walk down with you myself to see
				Michael's mother, and settle with her about the little fellow's destination."</p>
			<p> Proud and happy was Martha made by this invitation, and gaily did <pb n="159"/> she
				sally forth, when the cheerful meal was ended, for the rare pleasure of a
				tête-à-tête walk with the great man. Nothing could exceed Sir Matthew's good humour,
				he chatted, and joked, and talked of taking them all on a trip to Paris, and in
				short was hardly silent for a single moment. But amidst all this communicative
				confidential gossip, he never said a word more concerning the business they were
				upon. </p>
			<p>Once or twice Martha began to say something intended to preface an inquiry as to the
				local destination of Michael, but some lively sally from her father always turned
				the conversation into another channel, till at length they entered the gloomy region
				of Hoxley-lane; after which, neither of them spoke again till Martha said — "This is
				the house, papa. — But I believe we had better go in the back way. Shall I step in
				first and say that you are coming?"</p>
			<p>"No, no, my dear, there is no occasion to be so ceremonious, we will go in
				together."</p>
			<p>Martha then lifted the latch, and they did go in together, causing the sick woman to
				start as if she had seen a spectre. It was nearly three years since Mrs. Armstrong
				had last found herself in the overpowering presence of Sir Matthew Dowling; and the
				belief that this visit was for the express purpose of receiving her thanks,
				increased the embarrassment so startling a condescension was calculated to
				produce.</p>
			<p>Martha saw her colour change from pale to red, and then to pale again, and gently
				approaching her, said, "Mrs. Armstrong, my father, Sir Matthew Dowling, is come
				himself to talk with you about little Michael."</p>
			<p>"It is very — condescending, miss," murmured the poor woman, "and I'm very grateful
				for this, and all favours."</p>
			<p>"Very good, very good," said the knight, in return — not, however, looking very
				steadily in her face. "This young lady, who I suppose you know is Miss Martha
				Dowling, my daughter, paid you a visit yesterday, I believe, and spoke to you, did
				she not, about your little boy?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir," was the concise reply.</p>
			<p>"And you approved, she tells me, of his being put to a good trade."</p>
			<p>"In course, sir, I can't but approve, and be thankful for his being put in the way to
				help himself, and his poor crippled brother, too, when I am gone — but — I hope no
				offence, sir, I'd be right glad to know your honour's pleasure as to the place where
				he is to be."</p>
			<p>"And that is a little more than I can tell you, my good woman," replied Sir Matthew,
				in a friendly familiar tone. "I can tell you where his master that is to be, lives.
				That," he continued, drawing the indentures out of his pocket, "that we shall find
				written down here — But he is one of the first in his line, and a capital trade it
				is, I promise you, so that he has got work-shops, I believe, in half-a-dozen places.
				However, I'll make it my business to learn whereabouts Michael is to be, and let you
				know."</p>
			<p>As he said this, Sir Matthew opened the instrument and busied himself in unscrewing
				the top of his neat little portable ink-bottle.</p>
			<pb n="160"/>
			<p>"Then if it is all the same to you sir," replied the widow Armstrong, in rather an
				unsteady voice, "I should like well to know where it would be, before I put my hand
				to the binding him."</p>
			<p>Martha looked up, more than half afraid that such cautious acceptance of the
				important service offered, might offend her hot-tempered father; but equally to her
				surprise and satisfaction she perceived that his countenance instead of expressing
				any thing of the kind, wore a look of more than usual good-humour, as he replied,
				beginning at the same time to replace the red tape round the papers. "That shall be
				just as it pleases you, my good woman, we won't say any thing more about it, just
				yet." Then turning to Martha, he said, in a sort of half-whisper. "I can't stay now,
				Martha, we must go, dear, because I expect to find some one waiting for me at home.
				But we must not deceive the poor dear woman either. She ought to know, Martha that
				this is a chance I may not have again, God knows when, if ever. Can't you explain to
				her, my dear, that this is a sort of thing that by no means happens every day.
				Sometime ago I had an opportunity of doing this gentleman a good turn about one of
				his principal hands for whom he was greatly interested — for he is like a father to
				them all, and he promised then to return it whenever I had any thing of the same
				sort at heart. So now, I have written to him about this boy, and he has answered me
				as kind as possible; only he tells me that he has got such quantities of
				applications from the people round him, that when he has a vacancy among the bound
				hands, he can't keep it open, and that he must have yes or no at once. I am afraid,
				therefore, that we must give it up, my dear."</p>
			<p>This was "soft soder," as the inimitable Slick calls it; and the poor doubting,
				trembling, helpless bit of human nature, lying on the bed from whence she knew full
				well she should never rise, did not listen to it unmoved. She felt, as he intended
				she should, her heavy responsibility, and looked up into the face of Martha in a
				manner that very speakingly asked for counsel.</p>
			<p>The good girl understood the appeal, and frankly answered it. "You hear what my
				father says, Mrs. Armstrong," said she, leaning over the poor invalid.</p>
			<p>"Yes, miss, I do," replied the anxious woman, "and, God help me! — I feel as weak and
				ignorant as a baby about what I ought to say in return."</p>
			<p>"I don't know how that can be," said the innocent Martha a little reproachfully. "You
				know exactly how the case stands, and must certainly be able to judge what you think
				it right to do under these circumstances."</p>
			<p>"I hope excuse, miss, if I seem over mothersome and foolish about him," replied the
				poor widow in a deprecating tone, "but he's a precious boy to me, and the binding
				him, comes upon me unawares like."</p>
			<p> "Well then, there's nothing more to be said, I think," said Martha withdrawing
				herself from the bed. "It seems a matter of feeling, papa, and I don't think we
				ought to battle against it, for it is very <pb n="161"/> likely she would be unhappy
				if we persuaded her, let it turn out as it would." </p>
			<p>Instead of answering, Sir Matthew suddenly wheeled round, and looked out of the
				window, as if the bit of stony mould extending ten feet deep to the ditch that
				fenced it, contained something of peculiar interest and curiosity. During this
				interval, which lasted about a minute, the widow Armstrong again fixed her eyes upon
				the face of Martha, with an appealing look that seemed to implore assistance from
				her judgment, while it evidently expressed confidence in her kindness. When Sir
				Matthew again permitted his countenance to be visible to them, it expressed nothing
				but indifference; but Martha thought it was such an easy good-natured sort of
				indifference that there could be no danger in bringing him back to the subject, even
				though he said as he turned round, "Come, my dear Martha, I cannot stay another
				moment, I do assure you."</p>
			<p>"I am quite ready, papa," she replied; "but don't you think it is almost a pity to
				let such an opportunity be lost for poor Michael?"</p>
			<p>"Certainly it is, my dear," he replied in the most good-humoured accent imaginable.
				"But what would you have me do, my dear child? Depend upon it there is no real
				charity in assisting people against their will, or in a manner in any way contrary
				to their inclinations. You know perfectly well, that it was my real and sincere wish
				that this good woman's child should be well provided for. An opportunity for doing
				this, better far than I could have hoped for, is now proposed but evidently does not
				meet her wishes. Unfortunately I must send the answer by to-day's post, and surely
				you would not recommend me to accept this situation for the boy, excellent as it is,
				against his mother's will?"</p>
			<p>"No papa — only it seems to me that Mrs. Armstrong has not quite made up her mind
				about it; and I thought perhaps that a few minutes' consideration might enable her
				to perceive how great a loss it would be to Michael were she to refuse it."</p>
			<p>"Well, Martha!" returned the knight with a sort of jocose sigh, and at the same time
				seating himself on one of the widow's treasured rush-bottomed chairs, "I would
				rather make the person I expect wait at Dowling Lodge for an hour, than either
				disappoint you kind heart, or hurry this good woman into saying any thing that she
				does not really mean. What does the little fellow himself say about it?"</p>
			<p>"He's grateful and thankful, sir, for what is offered to him, and willing he is to
				accept it. — 'Tis only my poor weak sick heart that has got no courage left in it.
				You think, miss, he had better take it?" she added, turning her anxious eyes upon
				Martha.</p>
			<p>For a moment Martha felt a repugnance to the taking upon herself, as it were, the
				responsibility of the transaction, but an exclamation from her father settled the
				business at once.</p>
			<p>"Poor soul!" said he. "How natural is this weakness! Give her, by your advice, the
				strength she wants, Martha — it is the most valuable gift you can bestow!"</p>
			<p> "Indeed papa is very right, Mrs. Armstrong," said Martha cheerfully. <pb n="162"/>
				"Michael will never forgive me if I let you throw away this golden opportunity." </p>
			<p>"And I am sure I should never forgive myself if I threw away for him any thing that
				you could call so, my dear young lady, — I know full well all you have done for him,
				and been to him, and to doubt your judgment, would be a sin indeed. So if you
				please, miss, I am quite ready to sign."</p>
			<p>Had Sir Matthew Dowling wanted any strengthening of the motives which actuated the
				deed he was about to perpetrate, he would have found it in this speech. The phrase,
				"I know what you have been to him," requiring no very forced interpretation, in
				order to suggest to him that it was probable she knew what he had been to him also.
				However, he felt no inclination to disturb the business which was proceeding so
				satisfactorily, and therefore again smiled very kindly as he said, "I am sure nobody
				can find fault with your conduct in this business, Mrs. Armstrong. It has been
				exactly what it ought to be, and the better I think of you, the more anxious I feel
				to ensure this excellent situation for your boy. But stay a moment, I came down here
				in such a hurry, that I forgot the necessity of having a witness. Wait here for a
				moment, Martha, and I dare say I shall find some of Mrs. Armstrong's neighbours who
				may not only be able to witness these indentures, but also to give her their opinion
				upon the advantage of them."</p>
			<p>So saying the knight arose, and walked out of the room; but, before an anxious
				inquiry from the poor woman about the possibility of writing to her boy could be
				answered by Martha, he returned again, followed by Parsons and another overlooker
				from one of his own factories, whom he found <hi>accidentally</hi> close to the
				premises.</p>
			<p>"Here is a bit of good luck for us, Martha," said Sir Matthew, as he entered, "I
				should have been sadly put to it for time, if I had had to run about till I could
				find a man who knew how to write his name. I have asked two fellows already, but
				they both said, 'No.' — There is one comfort for you, at any rate, Mrs. Armstrong,
				your boy will never be in such a state of ignorance as that."</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew as he spoke, again untied the paper, and dipping a pen which had been
				stuck within his coat sleeve into the ink-bottle, he gave both pen and paper into
				the hands of Martha, saying, "There dear, you will hold it for her better than I
				shall — only make haste! — I hate to break an appointment."</p>
			<p>Martha received the paper, and without a moment's delay, laid it before the pale and
				trembling woman, placing at the same time the pen in her right hand, and indicating
				with her own finger the place, to which Sir Matthew had pointed, as that where her
				signature should be.</p>
			<p>The poor woman received both submissively; and after a moment's pause, looked up once
				more into the face of Martha who was bending over her. A kind and encouraging smile
				sat upon her plain but expressive features, and without further hesitation, the
				widow Armstrong signed her name.</p>
			<pb n="163"/>
			<p>"Here Parsons, sign away!" said Sir Matthew gaily, as he withdrew the document from
				the bed. The ready servant obeyed, and his fellow-driver followed his example,
				without waiting for any further instructions.</p>
			<p>"Now then, Martha, let us be off!" cried the knight, moving towards the door as he
				pocketed the papers. But stopping suddenly before he opened it he said, "By the way,
				Parsons, as chance has brought you here, we may as well make use of you about
				getting a few necessaries for our little stocking-weaver. We must trust to you to
				get whatever may be wanted. He may take the clothes he has worn at the lodge, for
				Sundays, but of course they would not be suitable for him to work in."</p>
			<p>"Very well, Sir Matthew, I will see about it," replied the important overlooker.</p>
			<p>"I must have no time lost, if you please," rejoined his master rather sharply; "for
				Mr. Elgood Sharpton mentioned in his letter, that he should be having some of his
				people passing this way who might take charge of him, and I am sure I can't say when
				they may happen to call. So go directly into the town, Parsons, and buy whatever you
				think the boy may want. I dare say this will be very nearly the last expense, Mrs.
				Armstrong," he added, "that I shall be put to for him, and I assure you that I shall
				pay it very willingly."</p>
			<p>With these words he left the room, and martha pronouncing a short but kind farewell,
				followed him. Soon after she had overtaken him, and again passed her arm through
				his, she was startled by a violent burst of laughter, and on looking back, perceived
				at no great distance behind them, Parsons and his companion, taking their way over a
				style that led by a short cut to Brookford factory. It was from them the hearty
				laugh had proceeded.</p>

			<p>MISS BROTHERTON VISITS THE WIDOW ARMSTRONG, AND LAYS THE FOUNDATION OF A VERY LASTING
				FRIENDSHIP — SHE THEN CALLS AT DOWLING LODGE, BUT FAILS OF OBTAINING WHAT SHE WENT
				FOR.</p>
			<p>
				As soon as Miss Brotherton and Mrs. Tremlett had finished their
				breakfast on the morning after the interview with Sophy Drake in the drawing-room at
				Milford Park, they set off together on foot to visit the widow Armstrong in
				Hoxley-lane.</p>
			<p> "Nothing can happen to us worse than our adventure in the carriage the day before
				yesterday," observed the young lady; "you will confess, dear friend, will you not,
				that Sir Matthew's walking into the <pb n="164"/> carriage was more terrible than
				any thing likely to befall us on the high-road without one?" </p>
			<p>"Why, I suppose I must, my dear," answered the old lady; "for to tell you the truth,
				I don't think you could look more put out if a constable were to come up and arrest
				you."</p>
			<p>"Decidedly not, Mrs. Tremlett; and listen to the birds, and sniff the sweet air, and
				then tell me if we are not wise to walk?"</p>
			<p>The old woman confessed that she really did enjoy it, and on they went with the
				gardener's boy for a guide, till in less than an hour they found themselves before
				the door of No. 12, in Hoxley-lane. Probably their little pioneer was not one of the
				widow's visiters, for the pass through the hedge, leading to the back-kitchen door
				appeared unknown to him, and in answer to Miss Brotherton's knock for admittance,
				the principal entrance to No. 12 was opened by the ragged mistress of the
				tenement.</p>
			<p>"Does the widow Armstrong live here?" inquired Mary. "Yes, ma'am," observed the woman
				gloomily; continuing as she made way for the ladies to enter, "The widow Armstrong
				is a lucky woman — she has got but one child left to provide for, and yet the
				gentlefolks keeps coming to help her, but nobody thinks of me and my ten young
				ones."</p>
			<p>The ready hand of Miss Brotherton was immediately in her purse. "That is a large
				family indeed, my good woman. Are they none of them old enough to help
				themselves?"</p>
			<p>"The seven oldest have all been in the factory from a'most the time they could stand,
				ma'am," replied Mrs. Sykes, "and if they hadn't, they must have been dead and buried
				long ago for want of bread. But though they have worked poor creturs, early and
				late, there's no more come of it, than that their bones be here instead of in the
				churchyard."</p>
			<p>"But with so large a number, all receiving wages," said Miss Brotherton, gently, "I
				should have hoped that you might have found yourselves better off than you seem to
				be."</p>
			<p>"And that's what we are told, ma'am, from year's end to year's end, and we must bear
				it, for there is no help. But 'tis a'most as bitter as the work that grinds us."</p>
			<p> Neither the person or manner of Mrs. Sykes were in any degree prepossessing; she was
				dirty, and in every way untidy in the extreme. She had on her feet the fragments of
				a pair of men's shoes, but no stockings, the rest of her clothing being barely
				sufficient to cover her. Her eye, voice, and complexion, furnished strong
				indications of her being accustomed to take spirits, while her frightfully thin
				limbs gave her the appearance of being half starved. In short, it was impossible to
				look at her without feeling that she was a degraded, as well as a suffering being.
				Mary Brotherton did feel this, and her heart sunk within her as she thought of Sophy
				Drake, of her drunken father, and of all Mrs. Tremlett had told her respecting the
				vice, which like a wide-spreading and hideous epidemic, seemed to ravage in all
				directions the miserable neighbourhood in which fate had placed her. She shuddered
				as she contemplated the wretched being that stood before <pb n="165"/> her, and till
				she had spoken the words given above, a deep feeling of the woman's unworthiness
				chilled the ready pity of her warm young heart. But both in these words themselves,
				and in the tone of quiet settled despair in which they were spoken, there was a
				frightful and mysterious allusion to some species of injustice and cruelty, under
				which accusation she seemed herself to be included. </p>
			<p>The distaste and reprobation that were a moment before making hasty inroads upon her
				benevolence, seemed suddenly arrested as she listened; and she was about to repeat
				again the questions she had already so uselessly asked, as to whence this universal
				severity of judgment against the factory labourers arose; and wherefore, beyond all
				others, submitted to the sentence which dooms human beings to toil, these people
				should appear to loath their employment, and execrate, as it should seem, the very
				means by which they lived. But ere her lips opened to demand the explanation to
				which she so eagerly desired to listen, a glance at the hard features of the
				wretched woman checked her. "It cannot be from such as these," thought she, "that
				truth and instruction can be reasonably looked for" — and as she silently gave her
				alms, and moved onwards towards the door which had been pointed to, as that of the
				widow Armstrong, something like a systematic project for making herself mistress of
				the knowledge she wanted, for the first time suggested itself to her
				imagination.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sykes eyed the silver largesse, as it fell into her hand, with a glance that
				seemed to devour it, and the words of thanks she uttered were almost hysterical in
				their eager vehemence. After delaying a moment for the contemplation of this
				precious "drudge 'twixt man and man," she opened the door of communication, and Miss
				Brotherton and her friend passed into the dwelling-room of the widow Armstrong.</p>
			<p>Contrary to custom, her lame boy, Edward, was sitting on the side of her bed, and
				when Mary entered, he was holding her hand, and gazing in her face with an
				expression of countenance which appeared to both the intruders to be the most
				piteous they had ever looked upon. The poor child was looking, too, most wretchedly
				ill, and the first idea which suggested itself was, that he felt himself to be
				dying.</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding the extreme poverty of the widow Armstrong, there was an air of
				decency and decorum about her, that might in any situation have commanded respect;
				but when contrasted with the appearance of her neighbour, seemed to indicate a claim
				to more observance than her visiters were showing by this sudden and uninvited
				entrance.</p>
			<p>"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Armstrong," said Mary, gently, "for breaking in upon you so
				abruptly; and I fear our doing so may have startled your sick child. — This little
				fellow is very ill, I fear."</p>
			<p>"It is long since he has known health, ma'am," replied the widow; "but it is not that
				which makes him look so white and trembling now. We have lost what was dearer to us
				both than all the world beside — and though I don't think as this one will ever look
				up again, I can't find a word in my heart to comfort him!"</p>
			<p>"What, then, has happened to you?" said Mary, with much interest — "Nothing bad to
				your son Michael, I hope?"</p>
			<pb n="166"/>
			<p>"You know Michael, ma'am?" said the poor woman, anxiously.</p>
			<p>"I have seen him at Sir Matthew Dowling's," she replied.</p>
			<p>"I wish you never had, ma'am!" rejoined the widow, bitterly — "We were only starving
				before, but now we are worse than that."</p>
			<p>"Do explain to me what you mean, Mrs. Armstrong," said Mary.</p>
			<p>"I ought to do it, ma'am, for you speak kindly; and that's a claim poor folks can
				seldom withstand. — But how can I tell you the matter, ma'am? I know nothing — and
				that's the reason why poor Edward and I are so miserable."</p>
			<p>"But that is a bad way to get into, my good Mrs. Armstrong," said Mary, cheerfully.
				"Don't fret yourself about fancied evils, which perhaps do not exist. Little Edward
				here should know better than that."</p>
			<p>The pale, brokenhearted boy looked at her with lack-lustre eyes, but said
				nothing.</p>
			<p>"Are you uneasy because Michael has not been down to see you lately?" resumed Miss
				Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"He never failed to come, ma'am, till he was carried away from us!" replied the
				widow, with a sob, that seemed the result of strength exhausted, and weakness that
				could struggle no longer.</p>
			<p>"Carried away from you!" cried Mary, changing colour. "What do you mean, Mrs.
				Armstrong? who has carried away Michael from you?"</p>
			<p>"Sir Matthew Dowling, ma'am, has had him taken away," and another sob followed the
				words.</p>
			<p>"Do not think I torment you thus from idle curiosity," pursued Mary, bending over
				her; "but I entreat you to explain to me fully what you mean. I am greatly
				interested for your little boy."</p>
			<p>"I thank you for it, ma'am," returned the poor mother, mournfully; "but I can tell
				little that you, or any grand lady, the friend of Sir Matthew, would think to the
				purpose. Yet the parting with him without one blessing, or one kiss, is hard to
				bear, though we don't justly know that any harm's to come to him."</p>
			<p>"I am no particular friend of Sir Matthew Dowling's," replied Mary, with an accent
				which perhaps spoke more than her words.</p>
			<p>"Then <hi>I</hi> will tell you about Michael!" exclaimed the lame boy, coming round
				the bed to the place where she was standing, and looking into her face as if he
				thought he could read all her thoughts there. "You have seen poor Mike when he was
				living there, ma'am?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, I have, my dear boy," she replied, gazing with deep feeling at his pale, but
				beautiful countenance; "I have seen him there more than once, Edward, and I am quite
				sure he was not happy, though he was dressed so fine."</p>
			<p>"He was more unhappy ten times over," replied Edward, "than when he was as ragged as
				me."</p>
			<p>"Was he unkindly treated?" demanded Mary.</p>
			<p>"He was beaten, kicked, and spit upon!" cried Edward, bursting into tears; "and then
				he was told to laugh, and look merry."</p>
			<pb n="167"/>
			<p>"A wretched, wretched, sort of cruelty!" she replied, "of which I can well believe
				Sir Matthew capable. But you surely do not suppose that he has run away from it
				without telling you or his mother that he had such an intention?"</p>
			<p>"If you knew Mike better, ma'am, you wouldn't think that he could do such
				wickedness," said the mother. "He has stood beating with strap and stick for years,
				ma'am, young as he is; and never asked to stop from the mill a day, though he has
				been bruised almost to a jelly; — and worse than that, too, poor lamb! a hundred
				fold, with such a heart as his, he has seen his lame brother there, that was always
				dearer, a great deal, to him than himself — he has seen the cruel stripes fall on
				his poor shoulders, too; and though he has come home with his little face washed
				with tears from it, he didn't think of running away."</p>
			<p>Mary saw that she had given pain, and hastened to atone for it by expressing her
				sorrow for supposing such a thing possible; and then repeated her request, that she
				might be told what it was that had happened.</p>
			<p>The widow then related more succinctly than might have been expected, all that had
				passed between herself, her boy, and Miss Martha Dowling, on the morning which
				followed the theatrical representation at Dowling Lodge. And before she proceeded
				further, Edward bore testimony to the spirited and courageous willingness with which
				his brother had adopted the proposed scheme. He had, it seemed, as usual, watched
				Teddy's return from the factory — told him what Sir Matthew proposed doing for him,
				and declared, that hard as it would be to part with him and "mother," he was ready
				and willing to start, and was quite determined to be the best boy that ever was
				'prenticed, and to be workman enough to maintain them both as soon as his time was
				out.</p>
			<p>Here the widow again resumed her narrative, and related very accurately the scene of
				the following morning; dwelling much on the young lady's kind manner, and on her own
				putting it to her whether she advised that the child should go, or not.</p>
			<p>"And Martha Dowling counselled you to let him go?" demanded Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Yes, again and again, she did," replied the poor mother.</p>
			<p>"You are quite sure it was Miss Martha?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, yes! ma'am; my Mike took care to make me understand that, the day they came
				together."</p>
			<p>"Then be quite easy in your mind, Mrs. Armstrong," said Mary, eagerly. "I have no
				great liking for Sir Matthew Dowling. I do not think well of him, nor have I much to
				say in favour of any of his family. They seem to me to be cold-hearted, selfish
				people. But for this one, this Miss Martha that you speak of, I will undertake to
				answer for it that she has never deceived you, and that if she advised you to let
				Michael go, it was because she thought the doing so would be advantageous for
				him."</p>
			<p> "Bless you for ever and for ever, ma'am!" cried Mrs. Armstrong, seizing the hand of
				Mary, and pressing it to her lips. "There is <pb n="168"/> truth, ma'am, in your
				voice, and in your eyes. Do as I do, Edward, dear! look at the kind face of this
				young lady, and see if you can't find comfort from what she says? I did think,
				myself, ignorant as I am, that the young lady had an honest face. But, oh! ma'am,
				let it be as it will, and make the very best of it, 'tis cruel to have our darling
				taken away in this fashion, without one word of take-leave and blessing!" </p>
			<p>"Indeed it is!" replied Mary; "and your being ignorant of the place of his
				destination increases this anxiety. But on this point, at least, I think I shall be
				able to set your mind at rest. Before this time to-morrow, I will take care to see
				some part of the family at the Lodge, and shall certainly not scruple to inquire
				every particular respecting your boy. Keep up your spirits therefore, both of you;
				and for the future, let this little fellow here look to me for his wages. I won't
				have him go to the factory any more. What sum has he been receiving for his
				work?"</p>
			<p>Astonishment very literally rendered the widow Armstrong dumb, on hearing this most
				extraordinary proposal. Poor soul! a few short days ago it would have been
				sufficient to make her forget her weakness and her want, and have put her in a state
				of mind that queens might envy; for she would hardly have been able to remember that
				it was possible to have another wish; but now the first use she made on recovering
				her speech, was to exclaim, "Oh! Michael! Michael! why beant you by to hear
				this?"</p>
			<p>"He shall hear it, Mrs. Armstrong," said Mary, in a voice of such cheerful
				confidence, that the terrors of both mother and son seemed to vanish before it. Mrs.
				Tremlett, too, ventured to add an encouraging commentary upon Mary's promised visit
				of inquiry at the Lodge, observing, that it was altogether out of probability that
				they should want to make any mystery as to where the little fellow was gone.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Armstrong, as she listened, seemed almost too happy to credit the evidence of
				her own senses; but in the deep-set melancholy eye of Edward, there was still an
				expression of suffering and of fear that looked as if misery had taken a hold upon
				him that could not be relinquished.</p>
			<p>"Now I must go!" said the young lady, rising, "or I shall hardly have time to keep my
				promise. But I must settle with you first, my dear boy. What was the amount of your
				wages by the month?"</p>
			<p> "Six shillings, ma'am," replied Edward, looking at her, as she drew out her purse,
				with an eye that seemed to doubt what it beheld. "Six shillings!" cried Miss
				Brotherton, as she put the pitiful wages of a long month's agony into the little
				trembling hand. "And have you lost your health and liberty for this?" Tears started
				to her eyes, as she contemplated the look of wonder and delight expressed by the
				countenance of the poor widow; yet that look was not turned upon her. Stretching out
				her arms to the boy, she caught him to her bosom, and held him there, much as if she
				had suddenly beheld him snatched from the fangs of some devouring monster. The face
				of the <pb n="169"/> child himself, she could not see, but his whole frame trembled,
				and they fancied he was shedding tears. </p>
			<p>"God bless you both!" she said, "to-morrow you shall see me again." And so saying she
				took the arm of her friend, and again passed through the dwelling-room of Mrs.
				Sykes. The woman had now three little dirty creatures round her, to whom she was
				giving bread.</p>
			<p>"Heaven keep you, ma'am! This is your treat!" she said, as Mary and her friend passed
				through, "It is the first time for many a week that I have fed 'em so freely, poor
				creturs."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton's heart was too full to answer — she nodded her head and passed on.
				Their homeward walk, up Hoxley-lane, across the London road, and along a pretty
				shaded bridle-road that led to a gate in her own park-paling, was performed almost
				entirely in silence. There is a state of mind in which ideas come with too much
				violence and rapidity to be told off in words. When this happens from an excess of
				happy imaginings, no condition can be more delightful: but when, as in the present
				case, it arises from the remembrance of painful realities, it is greatly the
				reverse. The misery around her was no longer a matter of doubtful speculation, but
				of most frightful certainty. Neither was it any vice in little Edward Armstrong,
				which drove him to offer up his sickly suffering frame to ceaseless labour at the
				rate of threepence for each long, painful day. She felt oppressed, overwhelmed, and
				almost hopeless. Yet at that time Mary Brotherton knew not, guessed not, dreamed
				not, of the hundredth part of what the unhappy class who had thus roused her human
				sympathies, were daily and hourly suffering around her.</p>
			<p>The first words she spoke on entering her house were to order her carriage, and
				having gone so far in the performance of the task she had undertaken, she turned
				with tender kindness to her old friend, and gave as much care to her comfort and
				refreshment, as if the relative situation which they had borne to each other in days
				of yore was just reversed, and that Mary was the nurse, and Mrs. Tremlett the
				nursling.</p>
			<p>"You shall do nothing more before dinner, my dear good soul, but lie down upon the
				sofa, and get cool. Not even Mrs. Gabberly, I suppose, could see any thing
				particularly dangerous and improper, in my going alone to pay a visit to Martha
				Dowling."</p>
			<p>And alone to Dowling Lodge the heiress went, pretty steadfastly determined not to
				leave it, till she had learnt exactly at what point of the earth's surface Michael
				Armstrong might be found.</p>
			<p>She inquired for Martha, and was shown as usual into my lady's morning drawing-room,
				where to her extreme annoyance she found her ladyship, Sir Matthew, Lady Clarissa
				Shrimpton, and Miss Mogg.</p>
			<p> If Lady Dowling could have been glad to see any pretty young lady, it would have
				been Miss Brotherton, and she did exert herself, more than usual, to be civil;
				while, on the contrary, Sir Matthew both felt and evinced considerably less
				satisfaction at the sight of her, than he had ever done since the fact of her
				heiress-ship had become matter <pb n="170"/> of unquestionable notoriety to the
				whole neighbourhood. But if his reception was cold, that of Lady Clarissa was warm,
				for she actually threw her arms round the young lady, reproaching her at the same
				time very tenderly for not having sent to say she was going to drive to Dowling
				Lodge. "I should have liked your carriage, my dear, so much better than my broiling
				little phaeton!" </p>
			<p>It was hardly possible at that moment, that either one of the four persons present
				could have said any thing to her sufficiently interesting to fully awaken her sense
				of hearing; unless, indeed, Sir Matthew had led the conversation to Michael
				Armstrong. But this he did not do; and, therefore, having endured Lady Clarissa's
				embrace, and answered her mechanically, she knew not what, Miss Brotherton walked up
				to the sofa where the lady of the mansion as usual sat enthroned, and said, "Will
				you be so good, ma'am, as to let Miss Martha be told that I am come to call upon
				her?"</p>
			<p>The surprised eyebrows with which her ladyship listened to this speech would,
				probably, under other circumstances, have given birth to an exceedingly comical
				caricature, but at this moment Mary Brotherton had no fun in her thoughts, and not
				immediately receiving an answer, she said, loud enough for Sir Matthew to hear,
				"Will you give me leave to ring the bell, and ask for the pleasure of seeing Miss
				Martha?"</p>
			<p>Lady Dowling still remained silently staring at her; but not so Sir Matthew. He
				reached the bell almost as soon as the young lady herself, and fully persuaded that
				this most unaccountable request could only proceed from some little manoeuvring
				project at that moment labouring in the fair Brotherton's head, which had, somehow
				or other, his son Augustus for its object, his countenance resumed all its former
				affectionate urbanity towards her, and taking her hand too suddenly for any
				contrivance to prevent it, he said — "Martha? ... Do you want to see Martha, my
				dear? — To be sure you shall. She is a Dowling, Miss Brotherton, though not quite
				like the rest of us. But where is the Dowling, young or old, male or female, who
				would not fly from the farthest corner of the world to see you?"</p>
			<p>"I only want to see Miss Martha just now, sir," replied Mary, half smiling.</p>
			<p>"And Martha you shall see, my dear, without a moment's delay. Desire Miss Martha
				Dowling to come here instantly!" he continued, as the door opened, and a servant
				appeared at it — adding, when the door closed again, "You do her an honour, my dear
				Miss Brotherton, in thus asking for her, that more than one of her family, perhaps,
				might feel inclined to envy." But as Miss Brotherton made no answer at all, and Lady
				Clarissa began to hem, and fidget, and walk towards the window, all which the
				observant knight well knew were pretty lures, meant to recal him, he contented
				himself with gallantly drawing forward an arm-chair for the heiress, at no great
				distance from Lady Dowling, and then strode across the apartment to sooth the
				irritation of his noble friend.</p>
			<p> Martha never suffered a summons from her father to remain a moment <pb n="171"/>
				unanswered. The message had been delivered to her in his name, and she entered
				almost immediately. Miss Brotherton, who was in no humour to make small talk for her
				ladyship, instantly rose, and went forward to meet her. "I took the liberty of
				sending for you, my dear Miss Martha," she said, "to request you would let me speak
				to you alone, for five minutes. — Will you take a parasol, and let us walk into the
				shrubbery together?" </p>
			<p>Martha, who certainly liked Miss Brotherton, notwithstanding the late painful scene,
				produced by her indiscretion, and who, moreover, at this moment, joyfully
				recollected how charming an anecdote she had now to relate concerning her father,
				acquiesced in this proposal with a ready smile, and saying that her parasol was
				always in the hall, the two young ladies left the room together.</p>
			<p>No sooner did she find herself beneath the sheltering trees of the extensive
				shrubbery, and ascertained, by looking round, that they were really alone, than Miss
				Brotherton, passing her arm through that of her companion, said, "My dear Miss
				Martha, I cannot help feeling great interest in the welfare of the little boy whom
				we saw performing the other night — little Michael Armstrong, I mean. Will you have
				the kindness to tell me where he is now?"</p>
			<p>Instead of giving a direct answer, Martha eagerly exclaimed, "I am so glad, Miss
				Brotherton, that you asked to see me, for I have quite longed to tell you all
				particulars about that little fellow — and all that papa has been doing for him. I
				do assure you, Miss Brotherton, that notwithstanding what you saw the other night,
				papa has been, and still is, most excessively kind to him. Only he was very
				troublesome about the acting, and papa's temper is hasty. <hi>That</hi> , as you
				must be aware, Miss Brotherton, is the case with many people; but there are very few
				who have courage and candour to own it, as my father does. In justice to him, I must
				tell you what happened the morning after the unfortunate play. My father sent for
				me, and said, that he was perfectly miserable in his mind on account of the anger he
				had shown towards Michael. He told me, as frankly as possible, that he had beat him,
				and that in consequence of this, the boy was evidently so afraid of him that he had
				no enjoyment when in his presence. And he went on to say that such being the case,
				he was determined to apprentice the child to a good trade, where he might learn to
				maintain himself comfortably, and assist his family besides. So you see, Miss
				Brotherton," concluded Martha, in an eager voice, and with heightened colour, "you
				see that if papa loses his temper, he knows how to atone for it."</p>
			<p> Miss Brotherton listened to this statement with the most unbroken attention; and had
				she not been previously aware of the kind and excellent nature of Martha Dowling,
				she would have become so then. Her hopes, too, that all was fair and right
				concerning the disposal of the little boy, were strengthened; and in full confidence
				of receiving a satisfactory answer, she said, "I am very much obliged to you,
				Martha, for telling me all this, because I truly feel an interest in the <pb n="172"/> little fellow. And now I hope you will tell me also to what part of the country
				he has been sent." </p>
			<p>"I would tell you in a moment, if I knew, my dear Miss Brotherton, but I do not. His
				departure at last was very sudden; owing, I believe, to papa's having found some
				particularly good opportunity of sending him."</p>
			<p>"I wonder you should never have asked where he was sent to, Miss Martha," said Mary,
				gravely.</p>
			<p>"I did ask, Miss Brotherton," replied Martha; "but papa said he could not recollect
				the name of the place."</p>
			<p>Mary changed colour, as she remembered the promise she had given to the child's
				mother; but after a moment's reflection, said, "Perhaps he may have recollected it,
				since, my dear — I wish you would run in, and ask him to come to me for a
				moment."</p>
			<p>Martha seemed to hesitate. "I am sure," said she, after a little hesitation, "that
				papa would be delighted to come here to talk with you, Miss Brotherton — only Lady
				Clarissa might — "</p>
			<p>"Nay, then, I'll go to him myself," said Mary, rather abruptly. "There is no
				particular objection, I suppose, to Lady Clarissa's being let into the secret of
				little Michael's abode." And immediately turning her steps towards the house, she
				re-entered the drawing-room, followed by Martha.</p>
			<p>They found Sir Matthew engaged in exhibiting a portfolio of splendid engravings to
				her ladyship, who was descanting upon them with rapture; though the application of a
				near-sighted glass to one long-sighted eye, while the other was effectually closed,
				rendered them pretty nearly invisible to her.</p>
			<p>"I beg ten thousand pardons, Sir Matthew," said the heiress, placing herself at the
				opposite side of the loo-table, and thereby commanding a perfect view of his
				countenance; "but you are too goodnatured, I am sure, to be angry with me, even
				though I do interrupt you. Will you have the kindness to tell me, sir, while Lady
				Clarissa is lost in admiration of that enchanting Venus, where little Michael
				Armstrong has been sent to?"</p>
			<p>The question was too unexpected for even Sir Matthew's sturdy self-possession, to
				receive it as he would have wished to do. His bold eye, which had been gaily fixed
				on the young lady, as she spoke to him, fell before her keen, inquiring glance, and
				he turned the page of Lady Clarissa's adoration with rather unseemly rapidity, as he
				replied, "To a tradesman — that is, to a manufacturer, some miles further north,
				Miss Brotherton. I have just been telling Lady Clarissa," continued the knight,
				recovering his audacity, "I have just been telling her all the little fellow's
				adventures. The love of novelty seemed to have superseded all other love in his
				young heart, for he was delighted to go."</p>
			<p>"But he could not have liked going without taking leave of his mother and brother,
				Sir Matthew. I have just seen them, and they are in a perfect agony about him — in
				fact, I am come here on purpose to ask where he has been sent."</p>
			<pb n="173"/>
			<p>"Fairest of messengers!" exclaimed the knight, with a tender smile, "how utterly
				miserable shall I be if I cannot answer you! — I think it is to Halifax, I am almost
				sure that it is either to Halifax or Wakefield that he is gone."</p>
			<p>"You have bound the little fellow apprentice, you do not know where?" said Miss
				Brotherton, with undisguised astonishment.</p>
			<p>"I do not say that, my dear young lady, I know he is apprenticed to an excellent good
				man, who is a stocking-weaver; but her has two or three large concerns belonging to
				him, and I protest to you that at this moment I really cannot say to which this
				little fellow has been sent."</p>
			<p>"I am quite shocked to give you so much trouble, Sir Matthew," returned Mary, "but I
				should be exceedingly obliged if you would learn the name of the place, and let me
				know it. I ventured, sir, to promise the boy's mother that I would learn this for
				her, and I am quite sure that you will not let me disappoint her."</p>
			<p>"Most assuredly not! I will call or send to-morrow at the latest, my charming Miss
				Brotherton! How I adore your benevolence! No wonder you are such friends, Lady
				Clarissa! Your hearts are made upon the same model!"</p>
			<p>To this satisfactory assurance Miss Brotherton made no answer; but telling Sir
				Matthew that she should remain at home on the morrow for the purpose of receiving
				his promised information, took her leave.</p>
			<p>With increased dislike of Sir Matthew, perhaps, yet with no very serious fears about
				the fate of little Michael, Miss Brotherton boldly determined to brave all the
				wonder which the act might occasion, and ordered her carriage to stop at No. 12,
				Hoxley-lane, Ashleigh.</p>
			<p>As it happened, however, she escaped all her military admirers, and reached the widow
				Armstrong without interruption; the absorbing mills were in full activity, and few
				of the inhabitants of the miserable region through which she passed were left to
				gaze on the unwonted spectacle. The answer she brought was received by the widow and
				her boy with breathless attention; but it was quite evident that it did not
				altogether remove the sort of vague terror which seemed to have taken possession of
				them. Mary's cheerful assurance, however, that she should soon bring them more
				satisfactory intelligence, could not be listened to without good effect; and she
				left them at last so infinitely happier than she had found them, that spite of Sir
				Matthew's unsatisfactory reply, and more unsatisfactory manner, she still blessed
				her morning's work.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XVII. </head>
			<p>A JOURNEY, BEGUN IN VERY GOOD STYLE, BUT ENDING NOT QUITE SO WELL — A FAITHFUL
				DESCRIPTION OF A VALLEY IN DERBYSHIRE — MICHAEL MAKES SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</p>
			<p>
				And where was little Michael? The indentures, when duly signed and
				executed, did not remain two hours in Sir Matthew Dowling's possession before he
				began to put in action the power they gave him. Mr. Joseph Parsons perfectly
				understood the nature of the " <hi>few necessaries</hi> " which he was commanded to
				procure for the young stocking-weaver; and accordingly, by the time Sir Matthew had
				taken leave of Martha in the hall, after their walk back from Hoxley-lane, his
				confidential agent was ready to attend him in his study.</p>
			<p>"Now, Mr. Parsons, I flatter myself that you will allow I have managed this business
				tolerably well. My excellent friend, Elgood Sharpton, will owe me a good turn — for,
				thanks to the meddling of old Sir Robert, 'prentice-boys are not so easily got as
				they used to be — and you and I, Mr. Parsons, have got rid of a most infernal spy.
				Now then, to business. How soon can you set off with him?"</p>
			<p>"As soon as a horse can be harnessed to the jockey-cart, Sir Matthew."</p>
			<p>"The jockey-cart! — the devil! What a fool you are, Parsons! Have you really no more
				wit in you than to propose setting off, willynilly, with this young cur, that yelped
				at the rate he did the other night, before all the fine folks in the county, in an
				open jockey-cart? Fie, Mr. Parsons, fie! — I really had a better opinion of your
				understanding."</p>
			<p>"I thought he was going to set off, at any rate, by his own free will, Sir Matthew,"
				replied the superintendent, "and I knew when we got among the moors, it wouldn't
				much matter to me, if he did sing out."</p>
			<p>"You are an excellent fellow, Parsons — true to the backbone, and as firm as a rock —
				but don't you ever undertake to carry through such a pretty little kidnapping scheme
				as this, where every thing is to be done according to law, unless you have got the
				help of a little such stuff as this," and the knight touched his own forehead
				expressively as he spoke.</p>
			<p>"There's few men as wouldn't be the better for a little of that, Sir Matthew,"
				returned the judicious Parsons with a submissive nod; "but I'm ready and willing to
				do your bidding, be it what it may, and that's the best way of putting your honour's
				wit to profit."</p>
			<p> "You are right there, my good fellow — one captain is always better than two. But,
				however, as to master Michael, Parsons, we must neither let him stay loitering here
				till his dainty mother has questioned all the gossips who will come to prate with
				her about her boy, and <pb n="175"/> about all the nonsense current concerning
				Squire Elgood Sharpton's, of Thistledown House; nor yet must we carry him off at
				noonday in an open jockey-cart, without permitting him to kiss mother and brother,
				and uncle and aunt, and the devil knows who beside, from one end of Ashleigh to the
				other, — all ready perhaps to tell him some amusing anecdotes concerning his future
				master." </p>
			<p>"But what be the indentures good for, Sir Matthew," shrewdly inquired Mr. Parsons,
				"if they don't give you power over the chap, let him hear what he will?"</p>
			<p>"Fair and softly, Mr. Parsons — there is a when and a where in all things. It has
				cost me some pounds, and a d — d deal of trouble to get up a cry hereabouts
				concerning my goodness and charity to these Armstrongs. Once get the boy off, and
				you and I between us, can make folks talk as loud of the great preferment he is come
				to, as mother Armstrong can about her doubts and alarms. There is no fear of that —
				I have more than one friend who will swear a thing or two for me. But once get up a
				screaming bout at the widow's, and a struggling scene in taking off the young
				gentleman, and we never shall hear the last of it. So, if you please, Mr. Parsons,
				we will just get the young gentleman to take a ride before he is an hour older. But
				not in a jockey-cart though. I believe you know the road and the baiting-place? — By
				Jove! Parsons, now I think of it, there would be no better joke than taking him in
				my own carriage for the first few miles, and letting you drive on, as far as
				Wood-End or there about, and wait till our coming. You know I have taken him out in
				the carriage lots of times, so he will think nothing of that — and I will have
				Crockley go with me to make the party agreeable. So off with you to Wood-End as fast
				as you can go. But it must be in the covered cart remember — and a trifle of cord
				must be in the way in case he gives trouble."</p>
			<p>Within an hour from this time, Sir Matthew Dowling's carriage was proceeding at a
				dignified and leisurely pace along a cross-country road which led to a lane, which
				led to a moor, across which was a track which led by another lane to Mr. Elgood
				Sharpton's factory in the desolate hollow, known by the name of "Deep Valley."</p>
			<p>The party, as arranged by Sir Matthew, consisted of himself, his friend Dr. Crockley,
				and Michael Armstrong. The little fellow had been repeatedly honoured by a seat in
				the same stately vehicle before, for the purpose of being shown off at various
				houses in the neighbourhood, and had a notion that he was now taken out, in order to
				hear the remainder of his great fortune announced. That this final proof of Sir
				Matthew's benevolence should have for its object the sending him far away from
				Dowling Lodge would have been, but for the dreaded parting with his mother and
				brother, a source of unmixed joy to the little apprentice; and, even with this
				drawback, the distant hopes of his young heart might have been read in the contented
				meditation of his eye, as he rode silently along in front of his jocose companions,
				who amused themselves the while in talking very mystically concerning him, and his
				very useful and judicious destination.</p>
			<pb n="176"/>
			<p>At length the carriage reached the point at which Sir Matthew intended his airing
				should terminate, and he looked out to reconnoitre the opening of a lane to the left
				where he expected to see the covered cart. Nor was he disappointed; a covered cart,
				with an excellent stout horse in it, was drawn up close to the bank to take
				advantage of the shade of a thick elm-tree that grew upon it. As the carriage
				approached, the occupant of the humbler vehicle peeped out, and Sir Matthew
				recognised the punctual Parsons.</p>
			<p>"Pull the check-string, Crockley," said the knight, "We will get out here. That is,
				you may if you will, there is no occasion, I suppose, for me to trouble myself, is
				there?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear no," replied Dr. Crockley, cheerfully. "Here comes Parsons, good man and
				true. Get out master Michael. Jump, jump, and enjoy it, my fine fellow! Perhaps you
				won't have much time for jumping when you begin learning your trade."</p>
			<p>Without thinking it needful to reply to what he did not very clearly understand,
				Michael did as he was bid, and sprang from the carriage to the ground. The
				well-known figure of Parsons greeted him as his feet touched the turf, and the next
				instant he felt his hand suddenly seized by him.</p>
			<p>"Shall you want me, Mr. Parsons?" said Dr. Crockley, putting his head out of the
				carriage.</p>
			<p>"Not at all, sir," replied the superintendent, leading Michael forward. "Then shut
				the carriage-door, John," said Sir Matthew, "and order the coachman to drive
				home."</p>
			<p>"Please sir! Please sir! — " uttered the plaintive voice of Michael, as he turned his
				head, and attempted to disengage his hand. "Please sir, is Mr. Parsons to take me
				away?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, my boy, he is," replied the knight, loud enough for the footman to hear. "He is
				going to take you to your new master, and you may give my compliments to him, my
				dear, and tell him, that I have sent him a very good boy. Good bye! — Good bye! —
				Home!"</p>
			<p>So ended the colloquy; the carriage turned round and drove off by the way it came,
				and Michael Armstrong was left alone with Mr. Joseph Parsons. He need not, however,
				have held the little fellow's hand so tight, for there was no rebellion in his
				heart, nor any thought of escape in his head. He knew his companion too well to hope
				for any explanation from him respecting this sudden manner of sending him off, and
				child as he was, he had no inclination to weep before him; but, on the contrary, his
				young heart swelled with a proud determination to behave well, and to set about his
				new employment with a stout spirit. Nevertheless, when he arrived at the cart he
				paused for a moment, before he obeyed the orders of Parsons to "climb up," and
				ventured to say, "Please sir, beant I to see mother any more?"</p>
			<p>"Climb up! I tell you," said the brute, clenching his fist at him, "and if you bother
				me with any more questions, I'll just give you this in your mouth to stop your
				jabbering."</p>
			<p> Had Michael counted twenty years instead of ten, he could not <pb n="177"/> more
				resolutely have screwed his spirit to endurance than he did as he now clambered up,
				and placed himself, as he was directed, in the back part of the vehicle, not another
				syllable passed his lips. For four hours the slow but sore-footed cart-horse, jogged
				on through a lane, that would have made any pace beyond a walk, intolerable. At the
				end of that time, the cart stopped before the door of a lonely public-house that
				formed a corner, round which the road turned off at nearly a right angle, and
				stretched across one of those wild and desolate moors which are, perhaps, only to be
				found in such perfection of dark and stoney ruggedness in Derbyshire. Michael, as he
				descended from the cart, looked out upon the unlimited expanse of dreariness, and
				shuddered; but his mind had not been sufficiently filled with the remembrance of
				brighter objects, to give the scene as full effect upon him, as it might have
				produced on others. </p>
			<p>The "Mucklestone Moor," haunted by the black dwarf, was a pleasant spot compared to
				it; for there the barren heath was only strewed with fragments of stones around one
				certain spot whence rose, doubtless with some pretence to picturesque dignity, "a
				huge column of unhewn granite." But on the Ridgetop Moor of Derbyshire, no object
				reared itself above the rest, either to attract or relieve the eye. As far as sight
				could reach, the wild heath was encumbered with a crowded layer of large and
				shapeless gray stones, defying the air of heaven to nourish vegetation among them,
				and making any effort of man to remove the congregated mass, desperate and
				unavailing. Arid, rugged, desolate, was the desert that spread around; and to those
				who knew the nature of the operations carrying on in every direction near it, no
				great stretch of imagination would have been necessary to suggest the idea of
				fitness, and sympathy between the district, and the most influential portion of its
				population. This is, indeed, a fitness that seems often found. Where towering
				mountains scale the heavens the hardy natives show a spirit pure and clear as the
				sweet air by which they live. In the rich valleys of the East the lazy peasant eats
				his rice, purchased with easy labour, and is content to dream away his being in the
				sultry shade. And in the flinty region of our northern moors, the race of Millocrats
				batten, and grow fat, as if they were conscious of, and rejoiced in the local
				sympathy.</p>
			<p>A stunted elderly lad of all work, came forth on hearing the rumbling of the wheels.
				"Ask the dame if she has got two beds in one room!" said Mr. Parsons, descending
				from the driving-seat, of which he had had quite as much as he desired. The message
				brought out a hideous crone, whose sharp visage looked as if it had drawn itself up
				into points and angles while battling with the rough blasts that roared, whistled,
				and moaned about her dwelling.</p>
			<p>"And who be you?" was her first salutation. To which Mr. Parsons only nodded
				graciously in reply.</p>
			<p>"Dear me! Be it you, sir?" exclaimed the woman. "I ax your pardon, for not knowing
				your honour at a glance. Beds? Ay, ay, plenty of beds, sir. — Please to walk in. Who
				is this fine young'un? He can't have nothing to do with the mills, any way."</p>
			<pb n="178"/>
			<p>"This a fine holiday suit, dame, that Sir Matthew has been pleased to bestow upon
				him," replied Mr. Parsons, "and if he had behaved himself a little better, he might
				have lived like a prince to the end of his days; but he is an untoward chap, and
				chose to cry, when he should have laughed. And so, you see, the fine folks at the
				lodge got tired of him.'</p>
			<p>"What then! — This be the boy, be it, as we have had so many talking about? He was to
				be made a gentleman of by Sir Matthew Dowling? And so he is turned off, is he?"</p>
			<p>This was said as the old woman led the way to the receiving-room, that is to say, the
				kitchen of the mansion, and here, though the season was still warm elsewhere, a
				large fire was burning. That its warmth was welcome might be gathered from the fact,
				that the only persons in possession of the room were sitting or standing close
				beside it. The guests, before the arrival of the new comers, amounted only to three,
				namely, a young woman pacing her way to a distant service, a stout lad, her brother,
				who travelled with her, to carry her box and guard her from harm; and a venerable
				looking man with gray hair, but having withal bright eyes, and a florid skin, and
				bearing in his dress and demeanour, the appearance of a thriving agriculturist.</p>
			<p>It was with so bustling a movement, that the landlady pushed back the little round
				table on which stood the farmer's mug of beer, and there was so much of respect in
				the manner with which she wiped the chair brought forward for Mr. Parsons, that the
				fact of his being a person of consequence, became notorious to all. The farmer
				quietly pushed back his chair, to follow the table, the young woman modestly
				squeezed herself very closely into the chimney-corner, and her brother fairly
				bolted, standing with eyes and mouth widely opened, to gaze at ease upon the
				distinguished society into which it had been his chance to fall. Mr. Parsons took
				his place among them, as such a great man ought to do. That is to say, he looked
				neither to the right nor to the left, but made himself comfortable without taking
				the trouble of considering whether any other person were present, or not. Michael
				crept in after him, and when the more important part of the company had arranged
				themselves, he was observed standing alone in the most distant part of the room.</p>
			<p>"What dost stand shivering there for, my boy?" said the old farmer, in north-country
				dialect, so broad as to be dangerous for south-country folks to spell, "I could be
				after thinking there was some mistake here. Surely you ought not to be standing,
				while some other folks are sitting."</p>
			<p>This observation, though the genuine result of the old man's notions of vulgar, and
				the reverse, might not have been so bluntly spoken, had he not felt himself
				affronted by the unceremonious style in which his place before the fire had been
				taken from him. Michael probably did not understand the full meaning of the remark,
				nevertheless he looked dreadfully terrified, and fixed his eyes upon the back part
				of Mr. Parson's august head, his face being fortunately turned from him, with an
				expression of desperate fear, that seemed to puzzle the good farmer.</p>
			<pb n="179"/>
			<p>"Well now, don't he look like as well-behaved and pretty a young gentleman as one
				would wish to see?" continued the farmer, turning to the young girl, "and yet
				there's no mistaking that t'other's his master."</p>
			<p>"Fine feathers makes fine birds, for them as can see no farther," cried Parsons
				contemptuously, and turning one of his threatening scowls upon the old man. "But
				wait a bit, Goodman Goose, and you'll find out perhaps, as all is not gold as
				glitters."</p>
			<p>"Poor little fellow!" exclaimed the farmer, on meeting the superintendent's
				ill-omened eye. "I wish, with all my heart, master, that nobody cared no more for
				your ugly looks than I do."</p>
			<p>"Dame Pritchard," said Parsons, without appearing to hear him, "Let the boy and me
				have a bit of supper, d'ye hear. Spite of his fine clothes, however, which were but
				a gift of charity, the boy is neither better nor worse, than one of our factory
				children."</p>
			<p>"I would not have thought it!" said the old man, apparently satisfied, and turning to
				his mug.</p>
			<p>"No, I dare say," retorted Parsons, with a sneer. "Such chaps as you, seldom finds
				out what's what, or who's who, before they are told."</p>
			<p>From this moment no further interest was expressed about little Michael. <hi>He was a
					factory boy</hi> , and what good was there in asking any further questions? So a
				thick slice of bread, and a scrap of bacon were set before him, and as soon as the
				more elaborate supper of Mr. Parsons was concluded, he with great affability took
				the little fellow by the hand, and preceded by Dame Pritchard and a candle,
				conducted him to a pallet bed in the same chamber as his own.</p>
			<p>For the first moment after he was left alone with the boy, the superintendent felt a
				strong inclination to make him pay for the affronts he had been the cause of his
				receiving below. But the same wisdom which had cut short his indignation there,
				checked him now; and having locked the chamber door, and given Michael a stimulating
				kick to hasten his undressing, he carefully packed in a bundle the Dowling Lodge
				suit which he took off, leaving in its place beside the bed, the result of his hasty
				shoppings at Ashleigh.</p>
			<p>When roused from his slumbers at day-break the following morning, Michael found these
				new garments ready for him, and for a moment his heart sunk at the change, for
				though new, they were of the very lowest kind, and formed as strong a contrast as
				was well possible with the dress he had laid aside on preparing for his night's
				rest. But the human mind will often show symptoms of philosophy even at ten years
				old; which truth was made evident by the manner in which the young apprentice
				invested himself in his new suit, cheering his spirit as he did so, with the
				recollection that a person going to be bound to a trade like that of
				stocking-weaving, would look very ridiculous in such a dress as had been just taken
				away from him.</p>
			<p>Early as it was, Mrs. Pritchard was ready in the kitchen with "a pot of hot tea" for
				Mr. Parsons; Michael received a fitting hunch of bread, the covered cart was brought
				up to the door, and the ill-matched pair set off again upon their journey.</p>
			<pb n="180"/>
			<p>It might seem paradoxical to say, that the temper of Mr. Parsons was irritated by the
				patient, unsuspicious, and submissive demeanour of his helpless charge; yet such,
				nevertheless, was the fact. It was many years since the bones of Mr. Parsons had
				been exposed to any conveyance more rough and rude than Sir Matthew's jockey cart,
				which was constructed with excellent and efficient springs; the movement, therefore,
				of the covered vehicle which had brought his aching joints to the "Crooked Billet"
				on Ridgetop Moor, was equally unwonted and disagreeable; and now that the peaceable
				demeanour of his little companion had convinced him that it was altogether
				unnecessary, he felt ready to twist his neck round, as an atonement for all he had
				endured.</p>
			<p>Ere they had advanced a mile further, however, his spirit found a species of
				consolation that was perfectly congenial to it. The drear dark desert that spread
				before them, dimly visible as far as the eye could reach through the chilling mist
				of the morning, was just such a region as his heart desired for the dwelling of the
				young plague who had caused him so jolting a journey; and here too the covering of
				the rough machine was far from unwelcome, so that Mr. Parsons, as he drove slowly
				and cautiously onward amidst the deep ruts, and rumbling stones, looked out upon the
				bleak desolation of the scene, with a feeling that almost approached to
				complacency.</p>
			<p>At length the moor was passed, and for a few miles their joints enjoyed the luxury of
				a turnpike-road. The country too, seemed softening into a species of wild beauty,
				that might, in some degree, atone for its bleakness. But ere this had lasted for
				more than a couple of hours, the horse's head was again turned aside from the main
				road, and by a steep and very rough descent, they gradually approached the level of
				a stream, running through so very narrow a valley, as in many places to afford
				barely space enough for the road, between the brook and the precipitate heights
				which shut it in.</p>
			<p>On reaching this level, the road, which for the last quarter of a mile had seemed to
				be leading them into the little river itself, turned abruptly, and by an angle so
				acute, following the indented curve of the lofty hill, that they speedily appeared
				to be shut in on all sides by the towering hills that suddenly, and as if by magic
				reared themselves in every direction round. It is hardly possible to conceive a spot
				more effectually hidden from the eyes of all men, than this singular valley.
				Hundreds may pass their lives within a few miles of it, without having the least
				idea that such a spot exists; for, from the form of the hills it so happens, that it
				is possible to wander for hours over their summits, without discovering it; one
				undulation rising beyond another, so as to blend together beneath the eye, leaving
				no opening by which this strip of water-level in their very centre, can be
				discerned. <ref target="#ENG18400N3">[3]</ref>
			</p>
			<pb n="181"/>
			<p>For about another half mile, the narrow cart-road runs beside the stream without
				encountering any single object, except its lofty barrier and the brook itself, more
				remarkable than here and there a reed of higher growth than common, or a plant of
				Foxglove, that by its gay blossom seems to mock the desolate sadness of the spot.
				Another turn, however, still following the wavy curvings of the mountain's base, for
				mountain there it seems to be, opens another view, and one that speaks to many
				senses at once, the difference between the melancholy caused by nature, and that
				produced by the work of man. A wide spreading cotton-factory here rears its
				unsightly form, and at one glance makes the happy wanderer whose foot is free to
				turn which way he will, feel how precious is the power of retracing his steps back
				again along the beguiling path that has led him to it.</p>
			<p>This was a joy for which our little Michael sighed in vain. On jogged the cart, and
				nearer it came at every jolt to the object which he most hated to look upon. But
				then came also the cheering thought, that he was no longer a mere factory boy, but
				about to become an apprentice to a good and profitable trade, in which hereafter he
				might expect to get money enough for himself, for mother, and Teddy too!
				Nevertheless, he certainly did wish, at the very bottom of his heart, that the
				stocking-weaving business was not carried on in a building so very like a cotton
				factory! But though Michael saw this hated cotton factory, he as yet saw but a small
				portion of the horrors which belonged to the spot he had reached. His position in
				the vehicle made it impossible for him to look round, and perceive how completely
				all the acts that might be committed in that <hi>Deep Valley</hi> , were hid from
				the eye of every human being but those engaged in them. Neither could he recognise
				in the dismal building detached, yet connected both with the manager's house and the
				factory, the <hi>Prison Prentice-house</hi> which served as HOME to hundreds of
				little aching hearts, each one endowed by nature with light spirits, merry thoughts,
				and fond affections; but all of whom rose to their daily toil under circumstances
				which rendered enjoyment of any kind both morally and physically impossible.</p>
			<p>The gradations by which all the misery that awaited him was disclosed, were, however,
				neither lingering nor uncertain. The cart stopped, Parsons got out, and then calling
				forward his companion, seized him roughly by the arm, and swung him through the door
				which opened to receive them.</p>
			<p>"Soh! This is the chap you are going to bestow upon us, is it, Mr. Parsons?" said a
				fellow, whose aspect must have withered hope in the gayest spirit that youth and joy
				ever produced between them. "Has he nimble fingers?"</p>
			<p>"He can move 'em quick enough when he've got a mind for it," replied Parsons. "But
				you must not spare the strap, I can tell you, for a more obstinate hard-skinned
				little devil, never crossed the threshold of a factory."</p>
			<p> "Never mind, Mr. Parsons, we know how to manage all those matters, you may depend
				upon it. We possess many advantages over you, sir. No parents here you know, to come
				bothering us about <pb n="182"/> bones and bruises. Here they all count at what they
				are worth, and no more. Children is plenty, Mr. Parsons; and that's about the best
				thing we have got in our favour; for it can't be denied but we all of us, at times,
				finds that we have managed to complete more work than 'tis easy to dispose of." </p>
			<p>"No doubt of that, Mr. Woodcomb. But you had better hand off the boy, if you please,
				and then we'll settle our little matter of business, and I'll be off. Your roads are
				none of the best, sir, and I must make my way back to the Crooked Billet
				to-night."</p>
			<p>"Not till you have had a bit, and a drop with us, Mr. Parsons. They are at supper in
				the Prentice-house now, and our young master shall be handed in at once."</p>
			<p>So saying, the scowling manager opened a door in the farther corner of the room, and
				made Michael a sign that he was to pass through it. The child obeyed, but he
				trembled in every joint. Feelings of deeper terror than had ever reached his heart
				before, were creeping over him. His lips moved not, but his very soul seemed to
				whisper within him, "Mother! Mother!"</p>
			<p>Yet at that moment the unhappy boy knew not what was before him; the influence under
				which he cowered thus, was like that produced by the leaden dimness of a coming
				storm upon the birds, who droop their pinions and seem ready to fall to the earth,
				even before a single hailstone has touched them.</p>
			<p>A long low passage led to another door, which was again opened by the condescending
				hand of Mr. Woodcomb; through this he thrust the poor Michael, and having either by
				a word or a sign made known to the governor of the Prentice-house, that he had
				brought an accession to his wretched crew, he retired, closing the door behind
				him.</p>
			<p>Michael heard the door close, and looked up. The room he was in was so long as almost
				to appear like a gallery, and from one end to the other of it a narrow deal board
				stretched out, having room for about two hundred to sit down at once. The whole of
				this table was now occupied by a portion of the apprentice children, both boys and
				girls, belonging to Deep Valley Mill, and their appearance might have wrung the
				heart of any being who looked upon them, however blessedly wide his own destiny
				might lead him from the melancholy troop. But to Michael, the spectacle was
				appalling; and, young as he was, he seemed to feel that the filthy, half-starved
				wretches before him, were so many ghostly representations of what he was himself to
				be. A sickness like that of death came over him, and he would have given a limb,
				only for freedom to stretch himself down upon the floor and see no more. But the
				master of the ceremonies at this feast of misery bore a huge horsewhip in his hand,
				without which indeed, it is said, he seldom appeared on the premises, and with it an
				eye that seemed to have the power of quelling with a single glance, the will of
				every little wretch it looked upon.</p>
			<p> The place that Michael was to take at the board was indicated to him, and he sat
				down. The food placed before him consisted of a small bowl of what was denominated
				stir-pudding, a sort of miserable <pb n="183"/> water-porridge, and a lump of oaten
				cake, of a flavour so sour and musty, that the little fellow, though never
				accustomed till the fatal patronage of Sir Matthew fell upon him, to any viands more
				dainty than dry bread, could not at this first essay persuade himself to eat it. The
				wife of the governor of the Prentice-house, a help meet for him in every way,
				chanced to have her eye upon the stranger child as he pushed the morsel from him,
				and the smile that relaxed her features might have told him something, had he
				chanced to see, and understand it, respecting the excellent chance there was of his
				having a better appetite in future. </p>
			<p>A girl nearly of his own age sat on one side, and a boy considerably older on the
				other; the first who had as much of beauty as it was perhaps, possible for any human
				being to have after a six month's residence at Deep-Valley Mill, looked up into his
				face with a pair of large blue eyes that spoke unbounded pity, and he heard a soft
				little voice whisper, "Poor boy!" While his lanky neighbour on the other side made
				prize of the rejected food, venturing to say aloud, "Any how, it is too good to be
				wasted."</p>
			<p>The wretched meal did not last long, and for a few minutes after it was ended, the
				governor and his wife disappeared. During this interval, those who had strength and
				inclination moved about the room as they listed, but by far the greater number were
				already dropping to sleep after a day of protracted labour, during which they had
				followed the ceaseless movements of the machinery, for above fifteen hours. Among
				the former was the hungry lad who had appropriated the oat-cake of Michael, and no
				sooner were the eye of the master and mistress removed, than he turned to the
				new-comer, and in a tone that seemed to hover between good-humour and ridicule,
				said, "So you could not find a stomach for your supper, my man?"</p>
			<p>"I did not want supper," replied Michael, dolefully. "You did'nt want it, didn't you?
				That speaks better for the living as you have left, than I can speak of that as
				you'll find," returned his new acquaintance. "Don't you say nothing to nobody, and,
				to-morrow morning, after the lash have sounded through the room to wake us all, just
				you start up, and jump into your clothes, and when we goes to pump, I'll show you
				where we gets our tit-bits from."</p>
			<p>Michael was in the act of nodding assent to this proposal, when the woman, who five
				minutes before had left the room, returned to it, and by a very summary process
				caused the ragged, weary, prayerless, hopeless multitude to crawl and clamber, half
				sleeping and half waking, to their filthy beds. They were divided by fifties in a
				room, but notwithstanding the number, and the little space in which they had to stow
				themselves, the stillness of heavy sleep pervaded every chamber, ere the miserable
				little inmates had been five minutes enclosed within the walls. Poor Michael lay as
				motionless as the rest, but he was not sleeping. Disappointment, fearful
				forebodings, and excessive nausea, all conspired to banish this only blessing that
				an apprenticed factory child can know.</p>
			<p> He had already laboured, poor fellow, for nearly half his little life, <pb n="184"/>
				and that under most hard and unrelenting masters; but till now, he had never known
				how very wretched his young thoughts could make him. His mother's fond caresses, and
				his brother's fervent love, had in spite of toil, and sometimes in spite of hunger,
				cheered and comforted the last moments of every day. The rude bed also, on which the
				brothers lay, was too clean, notwithstanding all the difficulty of keeping it so, to
				be tainted with the loathsome scent of oil, or sundry other abominations which
				rendered the place where he now lay, almost intolerable. Yet to this den, far, far
				away from the only creatures who loved and cherished him, he was come by his own
				consent, his own express desire! The thought was almost too bitter to bear, and the
				bundle of straw that served him for a pillow, received for the first hour of the
				night a ceaseless flood of tears. </p>
			<p>It was, as his young companion had predicted, by the sound of a flourished whip, that
				he was awakened on the following morning. In an instant he was on his feet, and a
				minute or two more sufficed to invest him in his clothes; this speed, however, was
				the effect of terror, for he remembered not the invitation of the preceding evening.
				But hardly had he finished the operation of dressing, when Charley Ford, the boy who
				gave it, was by his side, and giving him a silent hint by a wink of the left eye,
				and a movement of the right elbow that he might follow him, turned away, and ran
				down stairs.</p>
			<p>Michael did so too, and presently found himself with a multitude of others in a small
				paved court, on one side of which was a pump, to whose spout every child came in
				succession to perform a very necessary, but, from lack of soap, a very imperfect act
				of ablution.</p>
			<p>Neglecting to watch his turn for this, and not permitting Michael to do so either,
				Charles Ford made his way to a door that opened upon another part of the premises,
				and pushing it open, disclosed to the eyes of Michael a loathsome and a fearful
				spectacle.</p>
			<p>Seven or eight boys had already made their way to the sort of rude farm-yard upon
				which this door opened, one and all of whom were intent upon purloining from a
				filthy trough just replenished for the morning meal of two stout hogs, a variety of
				morsels which, as Michael's new acquaintance assured him, were "dainty eating for
				the starving prentices of Deep Valley mill."</p>
			<p>"Make haste, young'un," cried Charles, good-naturedly, "or they won't leave a turnip
				— paring for us." And on he rushed to the scuffle, leaving Michael gazing with
				disgust and horror at the contest between the fierce snouts of the angry pigs, and
				the active fingers of the wretched crew who contested with them for the offal thus
				cast forth.</p>
			<p> Michael Armstrong was a child of deep feeling; and it was, perhaps, lucky for him,
				that the burning sense of shame and degradation which pervaded every nerve of his
				little frame, as he looked on upon this revolting spectacle, come upon him while yet
				too young for any notion of resistance to suggest itself. He felt faint, sick, and
				broken-hearted; but no worm that ever was crushed to atoms by the foot of an
				elephant, dreamed less of vengeance than did poor Michael, as the horrid thought
				came over him, that he was going to abide in a <pb n="185"/> place where little boys
				were treated with less care and tenderness than pigs! </p>
			<p>He turned away shuddering, and feeling almost unable to stand — and then the image of
				his mother seemed to rise before him — he felt her soft gentle kisses on his cheeks,
				and almost unconsciously pronounced her name. This dear name, lowly as it was
				murmured, came upon his ear so like the knell of happiness that was never to return,
				that the hard agony of his little heart melted before it, and sitting down upon a
				bundle of fagots that were piled up against the wall, he rested his burning head
				against the bricks, and burst into a passion of tears. At this moment he felt a hand
				upon his shoulder, and trembling from head to foot, he sprung upon his feet, and
				suddenly turning round beheld, instead of the savage features of the overlooker
				which his fancy had conjured up, the meekest, gentlest, loveliest little face, that
				ever eyes looked upon, within a few feet of him. It was the same little girl who had
				been placed next him at the miserable supper of the preceding night, and whose low
				murmur of pity for all the sorrow he was come to share with her, had reached his
				ears and his heart.</p>
			<p>"You'll be strapped dreadful if you bide here," said the child. "Come away — and
				don't let them see you cry!" But even as she spoke she turned from him, and ran
				towards the door through which the miserable pilferers of the pig-trough were
				already hurrying.</p>
			<p>Perhaps no other warning-voice would have been so promptly listened to at that moment
				by poor Michael, for it was something very like the numbing effect of despair that
				seemed to have seized upon him, and it is likely enough he would have remained in
				the attitude he had taken, with his head resting against the wall, till the brutal
				violence of his task-master had dragged him from it, had not this pretty vision of
				pity appeared to warn him of his danger.</p>
			<p>He rose and followed her so quickly, that by the time she had reached the crowd of
				children who were still thronging round the pump, he was by her side.</p>
			<p>"Thank you!" whispered Michael in her ear, "It was very kind of you to call me — and
				I shouldn't have come if you hadn't — for I shouldn't care very much if they killed
				me."</p>
			<p>"That's very naughty!" said the little girl.</p>
			<p>"How <hi>can</hi> I be good?" demanded Michael, while the tears again burst from his
				eyes. "'Twas mother that made me good before, and I don't think I shall ever see her
				any more."</p>
			<p>"I never can see my mother any more, till I go to Heaven," replied the little girl —
				"but I always think every day, that she told me before she died, about God's making
				every thing come right in the end, if we hear all things patiently for love of
				him."</p>
			<p>"But God can't choose I should be taken from mother, and that's why I can't bear it,"
				said Michael.</p>
			<p>The little girl shook her head, very evidently disapproving his theology.</p>
			<p>"How old are you?" said Michael.</p>
			<p>"Eleven years old three months ago, and that was one week after I came here,"
				answered his new acquaintance.</p>
			<pb n="186"/>
			<p>"Then you are more than one whole year older than me?" said Michael; "and I dare say
				you know better than I do; and I'll try to be good too, if you'll love me, and be
				kind to me always, like poor Edward. My name is Michael — What's your name?"</p>
			<p>"Fanny Fletcher," replied the little girl, "and I <hi>will</hi> love you and be kind
				to you, if you'll be a good boy and bear it all patiently."</p>
			<p>"I would bear it all patiently," said Michael, "if I knew when I was to get away, and
				when you was to get away too. But perhaps we are to stay here for ever?" And again
				the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>
			<p>"That's nonsense, Michael," said Fanny. "They can't keep us here for ever. When we
				die, we are sure to get away from them."</p>
			<p>Michael opened his large eyes and looked at her with something like reproach. "When
				we die?" he repeated sadly. "Are we to stay here till we die? — I am never to see
				mother and Teddy any more then?"</p>
			<p>"Don't cry, Michael!" said the little girl, taking his hand — "We shall be sure to
				get out if God thinks it right. Don't cry so!"</p>
			<p>"I wish I was as old as you," said Michael, with an accent expressive of great
				respect. "I should bear it better then."</p>
			<p>As Michael ceased speaking he felt the little girl shudder. "Here he is!" she
				whispered, withdrawing her hand from him — "we mustn't speak any more now."</p>
			<p>"Off with you, vagabonds!" roared the voice of the apprentice-house governor, from
				behind them. "Don't you see the factory-gates open?".</p>
			<p>The miserable little troop waited for no second summons, well knowing that the lash,
				which was now only idly cutting the air above their heads, would speedily descend
				upon them if they did; but not even terror could enable the wasting limbs of those
				who had long inhabited this fearful abode, to move quickly. Many among them were
				dreadfully crippled in the legs, and nearly all exhibited the frightful spectacle of
				young features pinched by famine.</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p>Let none dare to say this picture is exaggerated, till he has taken the trouble to
				ascertain by his own personal investigation, that it is so. It is very fearful crime
				in a country where public opinion has been proved (as in the African Slave Trade),
				to be omnipotent, for any individual to sit down with a shadow of doubt respecting
				such statements on his mind. If they be true, let each in his own
				little circle, raise his voice against the horrors detailed by them, AND THESE
				HORRORS WILL BE REMEDIED. But woe to those who supinely sit in contented ignorance
				of the facts, soothing their spirits and their easy consciences with the cuckoo
				note, " <hi>exaggeration</hi> ," while thousands of helpless children pine away
				their unnoted, miserable lives, in labour and destitution, <hi>incomparably more
					severe</hi> , than any ever produced by negro slavery.</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p> It was with a feeling certainly somewhat akin to comfort, that Michael found himself
				thrust into the same chamber with his gentle <pb n="187"/> little monitor, Fanny.
				The mules they attended, were side by side, and though no intercourse was permitted,
				that could by possibility interfere with the ceaseless labour of piecing,
				nevertheless, a word when their walk brought them near enough to each other to be
				heard, was often exchanged between the children, and the effect of this on Michael,
				was most salutary. </p>
			<p>Superlatively, and above all others, wretched as are the miserable young victims
				apprenticed to factory masters, it is not unusual to find among them some helpless
				creature, whose first impressions were received under more favourable moral
				circumstances, than those in which the pauper children of the manufacturing
				districts are placed. For it is from a distance from those unblessed regions, that
				the great majority of apprentices are furnished, and the chances are, therefore,
				greatly in favour of their having first opened their eyes amidst scenes of less
				ignorance, degradation, and suffering, than those born within reach of the poisonous
				factory influence.</p>
			<p>Such was the case with Fanny Fletcher. It was not till mother and father were both
				dead, that she had ceased to hear the voice of love, and the precepts of religion.
				For three years she had, indeed, been supported by the labour of a poor widowed
				mother; but being her only child, Fanny had wanted nothing, had never been exposed
				to the hearing of coarse language, or the witnessing vicious habits, and all her
				little studies had been so thoroughly mixed up with religious feelings, that by the
				time she was ten years old, it would have been almost impossible to eradicate them,
				or rob her entirely of the gentle courage, and patient endurance, such feelings
				invariably lead to. When her mother died, all the world — her little world,
				consisting of a score of poor bodies of her own class, exclaimed, "Poor Fanny
				Fletcher!" But there was not one among them rich enough to save her from the
				workhouse, and to the workhouse therefore she went, whence within three months she
				was sent, with many others, as apprentices, to Deep Valley factory, ostensibly, and
				as doubtless the parish authorities believed, to learn a good trade, but in truth,
				to undergo a species of slavery, probably the most tremendous that young children
				were ever exposed to in any part of the known world, civilized or uncivilized.</p>
			<p> That the desolate little creature suffered fearfully, both in body and mind, cannot
				be doubted; yet at the time Michael first saw her, there was still that beautiful
				look of innocent patience in her eyes, which shows that the spirit, though bending
				under sorrow, is neither reckless nor degraded. Herself, and her companions from the
				workhouse to which she had been consigned at her mother's death, were the latest
				arrivals at Deep Valley when Michael reached it, and were still considered by the
				rest of the inmates as new-comers, who did not yet know the full misery of incessant
				labour, with strength daily failing for want of pure air and sufficient food. Fanny
				was by nature a slight delicate little creature, with an elastic sort of vitality
				about her which seemed to set fasting at defiance. That is to say, her sweet eye had
				not yet lost its brightness, but her beautifully fair cheek was very pale, and her
				delicate limbs most deplorably thin, though they had <pb n="188"/> not yet reached
				that shrunk and wasted condition which was nearly general among her companions.
				Michael looked at her as she bent over her threads, and repaired the incessant
				breakings among them with her white little hands, with a degree of love and pity
				which while it wrung his heart, softened the hard despair that had nearly seized
				upon him, by making him feel, that though his mother and his brother were lost to
				him for long long years, during which he was to taste of nothing but misery, still
				there was somebody who might grow to love him. This was a timely solace! Young as he
				was, he perceived at once, that instead of being brought to Deep Valley to <hi>learn
					a trade</hi> , he had been beguiled to enter there <hi>bound</hi> and helpless,
				for more years than he dared to count, and with no prospect of learning any thing
				beyond the same slavish process of waiting upon the machinery, which had painfully
				occupied his daily existence, and that of his dearer brother, as long as they could
				remember to have lived. Under these circumstances, it was truly a great blessing to
				have found somebody of whom he might make a friend, and so strongly did the poor
				little fellow feel it, that when the miserable band were led to their morning meal,
				he told Fanny as he walked beside her, that he thought he should grow to behave
				better than he had done that morning, if she would always talk to him about good
				things, and let him talk about mother and Teddy to her in return. </p>
			<p>"There's a good boy!" replied Fanny, soothingly. "I will talk to you, Michael,
				whenever I can — and never mind," she added, as they sat down again side by side at
				the long dirty board that formed their breakfast table, "never mind not having
				what's good to eat, it won't taste so nasty by and bye, when you grow used to
				it."</p>
			<p>"I won't mind it!" replied Michael, manfully, as he supped the musty-flavoured watery
				mess. "But I wish I had got a bit of good bread for you, Fanny!"</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XVIII. </head>
			<p>AN EXPLANATORY EPISTLE, WHICH DOES NOT PROVE SATISFACTORY — PLANS FOR THE FUTURE,
				FOLLOWED BY ACTIVE MEASURES TO CARRY THEM INTO EFFECT — A MORNING VISIT TO MRS.
				GABBERLY.</p>
			<p>
				During the whole of the day which followed Miss Brotherton's
				expedition to Hoxley-lane, that young lady remained waiting at home, not very
				patiently, for Sir Matthew Dowling's promised communication. But still it came not,
				and when, at an hour too late to hope for it any longer, she at length retired to
				bed, it was in a state of irritation and anxiety that left her little chance of
				quiet slumber.</p>
			<pb n="189"/>
			<p>Pale, harassed, and fearing she knew not what for the little fellow, for whose safety
				she had undertaken to answer, Miss Brotherton joined her good nurse at the
				breakfast-table, incapable of thinking or speaking upon any other subject. But it
				was in vain that the gentle-spirited Mrs. Tremlett again and again declared it to be
				"impossible, and quite out of all likelihood, that Sir Matthew should mean any harm
				by the boy;" Mary, though "weary of conjectures," could by no means end them by
				coming to the same conclusion; nor did the following letter, handed to her while she
				still sat before her untasted breakfast greatly tend to tranquillize her. It was
				from Sir Matthew Dowling himself, delicately enveloped, highly scented and sealed
				with prodigiously fine armorial bearings on a shield, almost large enough to have
				adorned the panels of a carriage. But all this perfection of elegance was lost on
				poor Mary, whose heart, indeed, seemed to leap into her throat, as she tore open the
				important despatch. It contained the following lines:</p>
			<quote><p>"My charming Neighbour!</p>
			<p> "If you knew, or could at all guess, how fervently I admire the beautiful
				benevolence you have manifested, in trying to quiet the fidgetty spirit of poor
				window Armstrong, you would be better able to appreciate the vexation I feel, at not
				yet being able fully to answer your inquiries concerning her boy. Think not, my
				dearest Miss Brotherton, that I neglected this business yesterday, on the contrary,
				I do assure you I gave my whole attention to it; nevertheless, I have by no means
				succeeded in learning what you wish to know. The facts of the case are these. A most
				respectable stocking-manufacturer, with whom, however, my foreman is better
				acquainted than myself, employs a multitude of young hands, most of whom are
				apprentices, in the different branches of his business. It was to this person, that
				the weak and wavering poor woman for whom you are interested, agreed to intrust her
				boy. Indentures were accordingly prepared, and I gave my superintendent orders to
				have the little fellow supplied with all necessaries, desiring that no time might be
				lost in getting him ready, as I knew that people belonging to this stocking-weaving
				establishment were likely to pass through Ashleigh in a day or two, and I wished, if
				possible, to avoid having the trouble of sending him to his destination myself. Now
				it unfortunately happened, that my man, Parsons, obeyed this order much more
				literally than I intended; for meeting in Ashleigh the persons I had named to him
				the very next day, he immediately mentioned the circumstance to them, and finding
				that they had a comfortable van, and every thing convenient with them, the whole
				business was arranged and done before I returned from a visit I had been making at
				Netherby. This was certainly being more prompt than was necessary, but it would have
				mattered little, comparatively speaking, had he not been such a goose as to let the
				van drive off, without even asking to which of the manufactories of the
				establishment it was going. Yet, although this is vexing, my dear Miss Brotherton, I
				should think it could not be very important. I have told Parsons to write about it
				immediately, <pb n="190"/> and he shall wait upon you with the information you wish
				for, as soon as he receives it. </p>
			<p>"Will you, my fair friend, join us in a little pic-nic party, projected by our young
				people for Thursday next, 'under the green-wood tree in Blackberry wood?' Lady
				Clarissa is, of course, to be one of our society, and she will communicate all
				particulars respecting place and time.</p>
			<p>
				"Ever, my dear Miss Brotherton,
			</p>
			<p>"Very faithfully yours, " Matthew Dowling. "</p></quote>
			<p>Having read this letter to the end, she turned the sheet, and began a reperusal of
				it, without uttering a word, and when she had again reached its conclusion, she put
				it into the hands of Mrs. Tremlett, still without speaking a word. Before, however,
				that excellent, but not rapid lady, had got half through it, poor Mary's agitation
				broke forth — </p>
			<p>"What do you think of it, nurse? for Heaven's sake, give me your opinion without
				delay! I am quite sure, that the poor creatures in Hoxley-lane, whom I have beguiled
				with my presumptious promises, will pine themselves to death with this uncertainty.
				Tremlett! for mercy's sake finish reading it, and tell me what I can do more!"</p>
			<p>It might not have been very easy for any one to have satisfactorily answered this
				inquiry; but the good Mrs. Tremlett was altogether incapable of forming any opinion
				worth hearing on the subject, for in truth she neither shared, nor fully
				comprehended the vague fears, that were tormenting her young mistress.</p>
			<p>Having, however, at length, despite of Mary's interruptions, contrived to reach the
				end of the epistle, her first words were — </p>
			<p>"Don't, my darling Miss Mary! — let me beg of you to refuse at once. There is nothing
				in the whole world so dangerous and cold-catching, as these foolish parties on the
				damp grass. And besides, the evenings are drawing in now, and I'm sure" — </p>
			<p>"Oh! Nurse Tremlett! Nurse Tremlett!" interrupted Mary, more angry with her than she
				had ever been in her whole life before, "How can you be so cruel as to trifle thus?
				Why won't you try to think a little for me about this strange mysterious business,
				and give me your opinion?"</p>
			<p>"Lord bless you, Miss Mary, if you were to kill me, I could no more help thinking of
				you first than I could fly," replied Mrs. Tremlett. "And, indeed, my dear, I don't
				see what you should put yourself into such a fuss for. What can you think is going
				to happen to the little boy! You'll just spoil that poor sickly body, my dear child,
				if you encourage her in having such tantrums, because her boy set out upon his
				journey a day, may be, earlier than she expected."</p>
			<p>"Then you really and truly do not believe it possible, nurse, that Sir Matthew
				Dowling should have smuggled the boy away, without intending to let us know where he
				has sent him?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Good gracious, no, Miss Mary," replied her friend.</p>
			<pb n="191"/>
			<p>For a moment, this opinion brought some consolation with it, simply from the decision
				with which it was uttered; but the next, all her anxiety returned again, for though
				she felt that there was, perhaps, something improbable and exaggerated in the idea
				of the child's being kidnapped in the face of day, and at it were before a hundred
				witnesses, there was at least no delusion as to his unhappy mother's state of mind
				respecting him, nor in the fact of her having in some sort pledged her own word,
				that the poor woman and her lame boy should receive tidings of him.</p>
			<p>A little further conversation with Mrs. Tremlett, convinced her that her opinion on
				the subject could be of no great value, inasmuch as it was founded solely on the
				notion, that "it was not likely, Sir Matthew Dowling should want to hide away the
				little boy."</p>
			<p>"No!" thought Mary. "Nor was it likely he should have acted, looked, and spoken as I
				saw him do, when his poor girl lost her senses from agony at my having witnessed it.
				If I misdoubt him unjustly, I will be careful that it shall not injure him. I will
				await his own time for information. If it comes, no one will be the worse for the
				impatience with which I shall have waited for it. But, if it comes not, I can be
				doing no wrong by taking every means of seeking it."</p>
			<p>In conformity with this resolution, Miss Brotherton not only waited with tolerable
				external composure herself, but continued in a great degree to tranquillize the
				spirits of the widow Armstrong, likewise; and during a whole week, Sir Matthew
				Dowling was permitted to remain unmolested. Miss Brotherton, indeed, did not meet
				him under the greenwood-tree, pleading an indisposition, which was not quite
				imaginary, as her excuse, but she troubled him with nor more questions.</p>
			<p>On the day fixed for this <hi>al fresco</hi> meeting of nearly the whole
				neighbourhood, Edward Armstrong was appointed to pay his first visit to Millford
				Park. During her almost daily visits to his mother, she had remarked that, though he
				uttered not a word in contradiction of the reasonings, by which she sought to show
				the improbability that any mischief could have befallen Michael, his speaking
				features expressed no confidence in them, and wishing upon this day of general
				riding and driving, to remain within her own gates, she determined to take the
				opportunity of conversing with him alone.</p>
			<p>She was by herself in her pretty boudoir when he arrived, and perceiving that his
				pale face was flushed by heat and exercise, she made him sit down on the sofa,
				beside her.</p>
			<p>There was something singularly sad in the utter indifference with which his young eye
				wandered over all the striking and unwonted objects that surrounded him. When bad to
				sit beside the young lady on her silken couch, he obeyed without seeming at all
				conscious that the rest he needed was now afforded in more dainty style than usual,
				and all the intelligence of his soul seemed settled in his eyes as he looked into
				the face of Miss Brotherton, and faintly murmured — </p>
			<p>"Is there any news of him?"</p>
			<p> "No, Edward, there is not," replied Marry, firmly; "but surely, <pb n="192"/> my
				dear boy, this delay cannot justify the look of misery it produces on your
				countenance. Tell me, Edward, what is it that you fear for Michael!" </p>
			<p>"I do not know myself," replied the boy. "And yet I think it over in my head day and
				night only to find out what is the very worst possible they can do to him."</p>
			<p>"But is that wise, Edward, or is it right, think you, while your poor mother has only
				you left to comfort her, that you should only strive to fill your own head and hers
				with the very worst thoughts your fancy can conjure up?"</p>
			<p>"I do not fill mother's head with them," replied Edward. "I have never told her one
				single word of all my dismal thoughts."</p>
			<p>"Then you are a good boy, and I love you for it. But what are your dismal thoughts,
				Edward? You may tell them to me."</p>
			<p>The boy hesitated for a moment, and then said — "I think Sir Matthew Dowling is a
				wicked, cruel man; and I think that he would be more likely to be wicked and cruel
				to Michael than good to him."</p>
			<p>"What is it has made you think Sir Matthew cruel and wicked, Edward?" demanded Miss
				Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Because he is hard and unjust to those who labour for him — and because I have seen
				him laugh and make sport of the tears of little children."</p>
			<p>There was something in the accents of the boy that startled Mary. — She felt inclined
				to exclaim — "How much more older art thou than thy looks!" so thrilling was the
				tone, and so profound the feeling with which he spoke.</p>
			<p>"Yet still," she replied, "it is difficult to see that he could gain any advantage by
				ill-using Michael in any way bad enough to make you look so miserable, Edward."</p>
			<p>"If he keeps him from me is not that enough?" said the pale boy, looking
				reproachfully at her.</p>
			<p>"But, Edward, you knew that he was going to leave you; and your mother, at least,
				consented to it."</p>
			<p>"Yes, she did consent to it. Poor, dear mother! She did consent to it. But had I been
				true, as I ought to have been, she never would," said Edward, clasping his hands and
				closing his eyes with a look of intense suffering.</p>
			<p>"Explain yourself, my dear boy," said Mary, kindly. "In what have you been otherwise
				than true?"</p>
			<p>"We agreed together — poor Michael and me agreed together, never to let mother know
				how bad we were served at the mill — and, above all, we agreed that she should never
				know how miserable Michael was at the great house, 'cause we was sure she'd have him
				away, and so lose the bit of comfortable food she has been having. But it was wrong
				and wicked to deceive her. We should have told her all, and then Michael would have
				never gone!"</p>
			<p> "You acted for the best, my dear boy, and must not reproach yourself," replied Mary;
				"and so far am I from thinking it wrong to keep her mind easy in her present state
				of health, that I strongly advise her <pb n="193"/> being still comforted as much as
				possible by our manner of talking to her. Fear not, Edward, that I shall neglect the
				safety of Michael, because you will not hear me talk of his being in any danger. I
				will not rest till I know what has become of him." </p>
			<p>Mary said this in a tone that left no doubt of her sincerity; and it was then for the
				first time that Edward seemed to remember her greatness. He stood up before her with
				a look of tender reverence inexpressibly touching, and said solemnly — "Then God
				will bless you for it!"</p>
			<p>"And he will bless you, my dear child!" replied Mary, with tears starting to her
				eyes. "He will bless and comfort you for all your duty and affection. Keep up your
				spirits, Edward, and, above all things, never be idle. It is for your mother's sake
				as well as your own that I am so anxious you should learn to read and write, dear
				Edward — and by degrees we shall get you on to ciphering, and who knows but we may
				make a clerk or accountant of you, and so enable you to get money, even if your
				health is not very good."</p>
			<p>The boy smiled languidly as he replied, "I should like it very much, if I was to live
				long enough."</p>
			<p>"You will get stout and well, Edward," said Mary, cheerfully, "now that you have no
				hard work to do. And you shall come up to the same school that all my boys and girls
				go to here — and when school is over, you must come every day to my kitchen with a
				little basket for your mother. You understand, Edward? And once every week you must
				come up into this room to me with your books, that I may see your writing and hear
				you read a little."</p>
			<p>A gleam of hope and joy kindled in the boy's beautiful eyes as he listened to her,
				and a bright blush mantled his pale cheeks; but it was like the flitting sunshine of
				April chased by a heavy cloud almost before its warmth could be felt or its beauty
				seen. "Oh! if Michael could but hear that!" he exclaimed, while tears, for the first
				since the conversation began, burst from his eyes. " <hi>That</hi> was what poor
				Michael always wanted. If I could but learn, and so get my bread without
				mill-slavery, Mike always said he would not mind working himself, 'cause he was so
				strong. But now that very thing is come; and he, maybe, will never know it!"</p>
			<p> Heavy and fast the drops fell from beneath the hand which he had raised to conceal
				his face, till Mary, as she watched him, wept for company. This, however, was not
				the way to help him, and conquering a weakness so every way unwise, she spoke to him
				with affectionate but steady firmness of the exertion it was his duty to make at
				time when his mother had none but him to comfort her. She had touched the right
				string — the little fellow's nerves seemed braced, and every faculty awakened by the
				words she uttered; and if he took back to his mother no tidings of poor Michael, he
				brought to her support a young spirit strong in endurance, and an intellect that,
				for the first time, had whispered to its owner hopes, promises, and aspirations,
				which seemed to make the life he had often loathed a new-found treasure to him. Mary
				saw not all that passed in the young mind she had rescued from the listless langour
				of despair, yet she perceived enough <pb n="194"/> to satisfy her that she had done
				him good, and that, however vain her hopes of benefiting the miserable Drakes might
				be, there could be no doubt that, in this case at least, her efforts would not prove
				wholly abortive. </p>
			<p>It is wonderful what an energy and renewed impetus this conviction gave to her
				spirits! No mildew can blast more surely, or bring a more lamentable feeling of
				withering over the heart, than that caused by the cold and false philosophy which
				would check every effort to do good, lest, by possibility, success might not attend
				it.</p>
			<p>The remainder of this day was by no means spent unhappily by the warm-hearted little
				heiress. The schoolmistress was made to expect Edward on the morrow — and the cook
				was made to expect Edward on the morrow. One Mercury was despatched to the town for
				a choice collection of slates, copies, spelling-books, and the like, and another to
				Mary's tailor in ordinary, with instructions to call on the widow Armstrong, and
				take measure of her son. All this business, and a good deal more tending the same
				way, having been satisfactorily got through in the course of the day that kept all
				the Ashleigh world safely entangled in the thickets of Blackberry wood, Mary
				Brotherton lay down to rest, and slept exceedingly well, though not urged thereto by
				having shared in their pleasant fatigues.</p>
			<p>She rose the next morning with a sort of pleasant consciousness of increasing power
				to walk alone in this busy world, and gaily announced at breakfast to Mrs. Tremlett
				her purpose of immediately making a visit of speculation to Mrs. Gabberly, in order
				to ascertain if any gossip was yet afloat respecting the disappearance of Sir
				Matthew Dowling's far-famed protegé. The distance from Miss Brotherton's mansion to
				Mrs. Gabberly's cottage was not great, and the heiress traversed it without having
				any fear of officers before her eyes, or any other protection than her parsol.</p>
			<p>She was, of course, received with expressions of unmitigated astonishment at her
				absence from the gala of the preceding day.</p>
			<p>"What on earth, my dear child, could have kept you away?" said the animated lady.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps I was afraid of taking cold, Mrs. Gabberly. Mrs. Tremlett took care I should
				remember how short the days are growing."</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Tremlett! — Nonsense! — Well now, I can tell you that you just lost the most
				delightful day that any body ever had. Such a dinner! — Game of all kinds — almost
				all in savoury jelly too! Think of that! So wholesome, you know, with the spice; and
				eating it in the open air, and all. Depend upon it, my dear Miss Brotherton, that if
				you suffer yourself to be boxed up by that ignorant old woman, you will very soon
				lose your health altogether. And do you know I can't help thinking that you do look
				rather feverish to-day — your eyes have that sort of brightness. I wish to goodness
				you would let me feel your pulse."</p>
			<p>"Nothing will do my pulse so much good, my dear Mrs. Gabberly, as your telling me all
				the news you heard yesterday," said the young lady, good-humouredly shaking the hand
				that was extended to ascertain her state of health.</p>
			<pb n="195"/>
			<p>"Well now, my dear, I am sure I have no objection in the world to tell you, and
				certainly one does pick up a vast deal of information at such a party as that. Will
				you believe it? two of the Simmonses are going to be married."</p>
			<p>"Really! That's very good news, I suppose. Had you a great many people there?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! Every body, just every body, but your own dear self; and I can truly say that if
				you had been there, it would have been quite perfect!"</p>
			<p>"You are very kind; but a person so very much afraid of taking cold, is always
				troublesome on these <hi>al fresco</hi> occasions. Lady Clarissa was there of
				course?"</p>
			<p>"Of course, my dear. And <hi>such</hi> a flirtation with Sir Matthew! God knows, I
				ain't over strict in any way: I despise it, because it shows such ignorance of life
				and good society. But I must say, I <hi>do</hi> think they carry the thing a little
				too far. Of course, a lady of rank and title like Lady Clarissa, is not to be judged
				altogether like common people. I am quite aware of that, and nothing can be more
				thoroughly vulgar than forgetting this. And I certainly have lived too much in
				really first-rate good society, not to know it. But, nevertheless, you know, there
				is reason in roasting eggs, and even an earl's daughter <hi>may</hi> get talked
				of."</p>
			<p>"Was Lady Dowling in presence?" inquired Miss Brotherton, smiling.</p>
			<p>"No, my dear, thank God she was not, or we should have had sour looks with our
				sweetmeats, I can tell you."</p>
			<p>"Did Sir Matthew bring his little favourite with him? The little boy he has adopted
				you know?"</p>
			<p> "Oh! dear, haven't you heard all that yet? Well now, upon my word, Mary Brotherton,
				it will <hi>not</hi> do, your shutting yourself up in this way. Catching cold,
				indeed! As if I, the daughter of my own poor dear father, wasn't likely to know more
				than Mrs. Tremlett about catching cold! Why, my dear, the little boy has been sent
				away I don't know how long, with a monstrous premium, paid by Sir Matthew, to get
				him entered at one of the first commercial houses in Europe. Dr. Crockley was
				exceedingly agreeable and attentive to me all day yesterday. And, indeed, so he was,
				I must say, to every body. We do sometimes differ about spinal complaints, and I
				think he is a great deal too speculative. But it is impossible to deny that he can
				be very agreeable when he chooses it, and it was he that told me all about this last
				noble act of Sir Matthew. To be sure he is an honour to the country if ever there
				was one, Sir Matthew, I mean. It is such men as that, Miss Brotherton, that brings
				wealth and prosperity to our glorious country. To think only of the hands he
				employs! Fifteen hundred children taking all his mills together, he told us
				yesterday, besides several women and men. Oh! it is glorious to be sure! However,
				Dr. Crockley did just whisper to me, but I don't believe he meant it should go much
				farther, he did certainly hint, that poor cross Lady Dowling, did not like to have
				the little fellow in the house, and <pb n="196"/> that was one reason why good Sir
				Matthew was in such a hurry to place him." </p>
			<p>"Did you happen to hear to what part of the country the boy had been sent, Mrs.
				Gabberly?"</p>
			<p>"Why, no! my dear, I can't say I did. But that makes no difference you know. Every
				body is aware that it is a noble situation for him, and that's the main point of
				course."</p>
			<p>"Oh! certainly. I only asked from idle curiosity. And I suppose, Mrs. Gabberly, that
				it is because I am so idle, that I do often feel curious about things that nobody
				else seems to care about. Do you know I am dying to get into a factory, and see all
				these dear little children at work. It must be so pretty to see them all looking so
				proud and so happy, and all enjoying themselves so much! I really must get a peep at
				it," said Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"Law! my dear! What a very queer notion," replied Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps it is," said Mary smiling, "as nobody else in the whole neighbourhood ever
				talks about it; but if I have such a fancy, there can be no reason why I should not
				indulge it, can there?"</p>
			<p>"Why, good gracious, my dear child! only think of the dirt! You would be downright
				poisoned, Mary."</p>
			<p>"Poisoned? How can that be, dear Mrs. Gabberly, when every body agrees that it is
				such a blessing to the country, to have brought such multitudes of children to work
				together in these factories?"</p>
			<p>"Nonsense, my dear!" replied Mrs. Gabberly, knitting her brows. "This is some of Mrs.
				Tremlett's vulgar ignorance, I am very sure. How can a girl of your good
				understanding, Miss Brotherton, speak as if what was good and proper for the working
				classes, had any thing to do with such as you. Fie! my dear! Pray never let any body
				in the neighbourhood hear you talk in this strange wild way, I do assure you, that
				there is nothing that would do you so much injury in the opinion of all the first
				families hereabouts. And nobody knows this neighbourhood better than I do."</p>
			<p>"I am quite aware of that Mrs. Gabberly," said the young lady very respectfully, "and
				that is one reason why I wish to talk to you about this notion of mine. Is it really
				true, Mrs. Gabberly, that none of the ladies in the neighbourhood ever go into the
				factories?"</p>
			<p>"To be sure it is. Why should they go, for goodness sake?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! I don't know exactly. — But I cannot see why they should not — if they wish it,"
				replied Miss Brotherton, modestly.</p>
			<p>"Well now, but I do, my dear. And I do beg and entreat that you won't talk any more
				about it. I am quite sure, Mary, that somebody or other has been talking nonsense to
				you, about all this. If you had got any friends or connexions towards Fairly now, I
				should think they had been telling you all the romantic stuff that has been hatching
				there about factory children, and God knows what beside. But I don't believe you
				have ever gone visiting that way, have you, my dear?"</p>
			<p> "And who is there at Fairly, dear Mrs. Gabberly, who would be <pb n="197"/> likely
				to talk to me on such a subject?" said Marry, colouring to the temples, with
				eagerness to hear the answer. "Good gracious! my dear, did you never hear tell of
				that poor wrong-headed clergyman, George Bell? Such a difference to be sure between
				one man and another. My dear good Mr. Gabberly never in his life breathed a word
				that could hurt the feelings of his neighbours. He visited them every one, and was
				on the best and most friendly terms with them all, which is what I call living in
				the true spirit of Christian charity. Whereas this tiresome, troublesome, Mr. Bell,
				has taken it into his head to find out wrong, where every body else sees nothing but
				right; and God forbid, my dear, that you should take it into <hi>your</hi> dear
				innocent head to follow any of his mischievous fancies; I wonder what he'll get by
				it? Great goose he must be, to be sure, not to see that he is going exactly the way
				to set every body that can be of the least use to him smack against him in all
				things!" </p>
			<p>"What is it he does, Mrs. Gabberly, that is so very wrong?" demanded Miss
				Brotherton.</p><p>"What is it he does? Why just every thing he ought not to do, my
				dear, that's all. You would hardly believe, perhaps, that a clergyman should
				actually encourage the poor to complain of the very labour by which they live? And
				yet I give you my word and honour that is exactly what he has been doing. It's
				incredible, isn't it, almost? He positively says, loud enough for all the country to
				hear him, that the labour in the factories — such a blessing as it is to the poor —
				he actually says that it is bad for the children's health. Such stuff, you know, my
				dear, as if the medical men did not know best; and there's numbers of 'em that
				declare that it's quite impossible to tell in any way satisfactory that it can do
				'em any harm at all. And, upon my word, I don't know what poor people will come to!
				It's quite out of the question to attempt pleasing 'em. If they've got no work they
				are perfectly outrageous about that, and ready to tear people to pieces just to get
				it; and no sooner is there enough to do, than away they go bawling again, swearing
				that the children are over-worked; isn't it provoking my dear?"</p>
			<p>"Mr. George Bell," said Mary, very distinctly.</p>
			<p>"Yes, my dear, that's the name of the foolish man who seems to take a pleasure in
				making people fancy they are not well enough off, when I'm sure, by all I can hear
				and understand, these very identical people may consider themselves first and
				foremost of the whole world for prosperity," replied Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
			<p>"Fairly?" rejoined Miss Brotherton, interrogatively.</p>
			<p>"Yes my dear, Farily's where he lives, if I don't mistake."</p>
			<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Gabberly," said the young lady, rising somewhat abruptly; "I am
				very glad you had such a pleasant day yesterday. Good bye." And without permitting
				the stream of Mrs. Gabberly's eloquence to well forth upon her afresh, the heiress
				slipped through the parlour door, and escaped.</p>

			<p>A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY — A PLAIN STATEMENT, LEADING TO THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN WHERE
				IGNORANCE IS NOT BLISS, KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ALWAYS HAPPINESS — A HASTY FRIENDSHIP THAT
				MAY NEVERTHELESS PROVE LASTING.</p>
			<p>
				To order the carriage, and to give Mrs. Tremlett notice that she
				wished her to make all speed in preparing to accompany her in it, was to Miss
				Brotherton the work of a moment. As the business she was upon might, however, take
				some hours, she urged her old friend to eat luncheon as if certain of having no
				dinner; and having given time for this, and interrogated her coachman concerning
				distance and so forth, the hopeful, animated girl, sprung into her carriage as the
				clock struck two, determined not o re-enter her mansion till she had lost some
				portion of the ignorance which had of late so cruelly tormented her.</p>
			<p>The roads were good, and by the help of a short bait, Miss Brotherton and her
				companion reached Fairly turnpike a little after four. Here she made inquiries for
				the residence of Mr. Bell, and having learned in what direction she should find it,
				repeated the instructions to her coachman and bade him drive on.</p>
			<p>"Are the horses to be put up there, ma'am?" demanded the coachman.</p>
			<p>"Yes — no, James, not there I suppose — that is, not at the clergyman's house; but of
				course you will be able to find some place quite near, you know; and William must
				wait — no, not wait, but come back as soon as he knows where you put up, that I may
				send for you when I am ready."</p>
			<p>To these, not over-clear, instructions James answered "Yes ma'am," and drove off.</p>
			<p>In obedience to the directions received at the tollbar, the carriage soon left the
				high-road, and proceeded down a grassy lane, which harvest carts for the time and
				rolled into smoothness. Less than a quarter of a mile of this, brought the wanderers
				to another turning, that in five minutes placed them before the gates of an edifice
				the aspect of which made Mary pull the check-string.</p>
			<p>"That looks like a parsonage-house! Does it not?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>And before Mrs. Tremlett could answer, William had already opened the door, and let
				down the steps. It was very easy to get out, and very easy to inquire if Mr. Bell
				were at home; but when answered in the affirmative, Miss Brotherton felt that it was
				not very easy to decide in what manner to explain the cause of her visit to the
				object of it. She had by no means settled this point to her satisfaction, when the
				door of a small parlour, lined with books, was opened to her, and she found herself
				in the presence of the gentleman she had so unceremoniously come to visit.</p>
			<pb n="199"/>
			<p>There was much in the countenance of Mr. Bell to reassure a more timid spirit than
				that of Mary Brotherton; nevertheless she stood before him for a minute or two in
				some embarrassment, not so much from fear of him, as of herself. Did she fail to
				make him at once understand the motive of her inquiries, he could not avoid thinking
				both them and herself impertinent, and this consciousness caused a much brighter
				glow than usual to mantle her cheeks, as the stood before him, with her eyes fixed
				timidly, and almost beseechingly, on his face.</p>
			<p>Although Miss Brotherton had not quite the easy and <hi>(tant soit peu)</hi> assured
				air of a woman of fashion, there was enough in her appearance to indicate her claim
				to observance, as well as admiration, and Mr. Bell opened the conversation by
				earnestly requesting that she would sit down.</p>
			<p>His aspect had done much towards giving her courage, and his voice did more.</p>
			<p>"You are very kind sir," said she, "to receive so courteously a stranger, who has in
				truth no excuse whatever to offer for thus intruding on you. Nevertheless, I am
				greatly tempted to hope, that if I can succeed in making you understand the object
				of my visit, you will forgive the freedom of it."</p>
			<p>"And I," returned Mr. Bell, smiling, "am greatly tempted to believe that let the
				object of this visit be what it may, I must always feel grateful to it. Is there any
				thing, my dear young lady, that I can do to serve you?"</p>
			<p>"There is indeed, Mr. Bell!" she replied, with great earnestness of voice and manner.
				"I am come to you for instruction. Though you do not know me, you probably may know
				the place at which I live. My name is Mary Brotherton, and my house is called
				Millford Park."</p>
			<p>"Certainly, Miss Brotherton, both your name, and that of your residence are know to
				me — on what subject can I give you any information that may be useful?"</p>
			<p> "Circumstances, Mr. Bell, have lately directed my attention to a subject which my
				own situation in life, as well as the neighbourhood in which I live ought to have
				long ago made thoroughly familiar to me — such is not the case, however; I am
				profoundly, and I fear shamefully ignorant respecting the large and very important
				class of our population employed in the factories. I am in possession of a large
				fortune wholly amassed from the profits obtained by my father from this species of
				labour, and I cannot but feel great interest in the welfare and prosperity of the
				people employed in it — especially as I understand a very large proportion of them
				are young children — and moreover, that from some cause or other, which I can by no
				means understand, the whole class of 'the factory people,' as I hear them called,
				are spoken of with less kindness and respect by those who have grown rich upon their
				industry, than any other description of human beings whatever. I am told, sir, that
				it would be <hi>unsafe, improper</hi> , and altogether <hi>wrong</hi> were I to
				attempt making myself personally acquainted with them, as I would wish to do — and
				having accidentally, Mr. Bell, heard your <pb n="200"/> name mentioned as a person
				who took an interest in their concerns, I have come to you thus unceremoniously, in
				the hope that you would have the kindness to give me more accurate information on
				the subject, than I have found it possible to obtain elsewhere." </p>
			<p>Mr. Bell, who had placed himself immediately opposite to her, looked in her young
				face, and listened to her earnest voice as she spoke, with the deepest attention. It
				soon became sufficiently clear that he considered not this intrusion as requiring
				apology, but that on the contrary his very heart and soul were moved by her words.
				He paused for a moment after she had ceased speaking, as if unwilling to interrupt
				her by his reply; but when he found that she remained silent, he said,</p>
			<p>"The subject on which you are come to converse with me, my dear Miss Brotherton, is
				assuredly the very last I should have expected to hear named by a young lady in your
				position — for it is one from which the rich and great of our district turn away
				with loathing and contempt. Yet is it the one of all others to which I would if
				possible direct their best attention, involving as it does both their interest and
				their duty beyond any other. But I fear I cannot enter upon it without wounding many
				prejudices which of necessity you must have imbibed, and proving to you that much
				which doubtless you have been educated to consider right, is on the contrary most
				lamentably wrong. Can you bear this my dear young lady?"</p>
			<p>"I hope I could, in a search after truth, Mr. Bell, even if my mind were in the
				condition you suppose," replied Mary. "But this is not the case. You will not have
				to remove many false impressions I think. — It is the total absence of all knowledge
				on the subject, which I am bold enough to ask you to remedy."</p>
			<p>"And most willingly will I endeavour to do so, to the very best of my ability,"
				replied Mr. Bell. — "But to me it is a beguiling subject, and if I detain you too
				long, you must tell me so."</p>
			<p>"Fear not," replied Mary, smiling. "I shall be more willing to hear, than you to
				speak."</p>
			<p>"You are of course aware, Miss Brotherton," resumed the clergyman, "that the large
				proportion of young labourers to whom you have just alluded, are calculated to
				amount, in Yorkshire and Lancashire alone to upwards of two hundred thousand."</p>
			<p>"Is it possible?" exclaimed Mary. "Alas! Mr. Bell you must not think that ' <hi>of
					course</hi> ' I know any thing — had you named two thousand as the number, my
				surprise would have been less."</p>
			<p>"But so it is, Miss Brotherton. Above two hundred thousand young creatures, including
				infants among them, counting only five years of life, are thus employed in the
				counties I have named; and they surely form a class, which both from their numbers,
				and their helplessness are entitled to English sympathy and protection?"</p>
			<p> "Unquestionably!" cried Mary, eagerly, "I always feel that the labouring poor have
				great and unceasing claims upon the sympathy and assistance of the rich. — But this
				claim must be equally great I <pb n="201"/> should suppose amongst all the labouring
				classes. Is it not, Mr. Bell?" </p>
			<p>"I feel it difficult to answer your question by a negative," he replied, "because,
				taken in its broadest sense, it most assuredly demands an affirmative. Nevertheless
				it is unquestionably true that at this moment there is no race of human beings in
				any portion of the known world — the most wretched of negro slaves not excepted,
				Miss Brotherton — who require the protection and assistance of their happier
				fellow-creatures, in the same degree as the young creatures employed in our
				factories."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton looked at him, not doubtingly, but with considerable surprise, and
				timidly replied, "But the negro slave, Mr. Bell, has no choice left him — he is the
					<hi>property</hi> of his master."</p>
			<p> "Neither has the factory child a choice, Miss Brotherton. He too is a
					<hi>property</hi> ; nor is it the least horrible part of the evil which
				noiselessly has grown out of this tremendous system, that the beings whom nature has
				ordained throughout creation to keep watch and ward over the helpless weakness of
				infant life, are driven by it to struggle with, and trample down the holiest and
				dearest of human ties — even the love of a parent for its offspring. Picture to
				yourself a bleak winter's morning, Miss Brotherton, when the mother of factory
				children must be up hours and hours before the sun to rouse her half-rested little
				ones; and nervously watching her rude clock till the dreaded moment comes, must
				shake the little creatures, whose slumber the very beast of the field might teach
				her to watch over and guard, till they awake, and starting in terror from their
				short sleep, ask if the hour be come? The wretched mother, and the wretched child
				then vie with each other in their trembling haste to seize the tattered
				mill-clothes, and to put them on. The mother dreads the fine of one quarter of the
				infant's daily wages, which would be levied, should it arrive but a minute too late,
				and the poor child dreads the strap, which, in addition, is as surely the punishment
				for delay. Miss Brotherton, I have seen with my own eyes the assembling of some
				hundreds of factory children before the still unopened doors of their prison-house,
				while the lingering darkness of a winter's night had yet to last three hours. I
				shall never forget one bitter morning, last January twelvemonth! The last piteous
				summons from a dying parishioner had left me no choice but to exchange my pillow for
				the bitter biting blast of Howley-common, and the path across it leading me within a
				hundred yards of a large cotton-factory, I witnessed a spectacle, which to my dying
				day I shall never recall without a shudder! There was just moon enough to show me
				all the dreary sternness of the scene. — The ground was covered deep with snow, and
				a cutting wind blew whistling through the long line of old Scotch firs which
				bordered an enclosure beside the road. As I scudded on beneath them, my eye caught
				the little figures of a multitude of children, made distinctly visible, even by that
				dim light, by the strong relief in which their dark garments showed themselves
				against the snow. A few steps further brought me in full view of the factory gates,
				and then I perceived considerably above two hundred of these miserable little
				victims <pb n="202"/> to avarice all huddled together on the ground and seemingly
				half buried in the drift that was blown against them. I stood still and gazed upon
				them — I knew full well what, and how great was the terror which had brought them
				there too soon, and in my heart of hearts I cursed the boasted manufacturing wealth
				of England, which running, in this direction at least, in a most darkened narrow
				channel, gives power, <hi>lawless and irresistible</hi> to overwhelm and crush the
				land it pretends to fructify. While still spell-bound by this appalling picture, I
				was startled by the sound of a low moaning from the other side of the road, at a
				short distance from me, and turning towards it perceived a woman bending over a
				little girl who appeared sinking to the ground. A few rapid steps brought me close
				to them, and I found on examination that the child was so benumbed and exhausted as
				to be totally incapable of pursuing her way — it was her <hi>mother</hi> who was
				urging her forward, and who even then seemed more intent upon saving a fine, than on
				the obvious sufferings of her sinking child. I know, poor wretch, that little choice
				was left her, and that the inevitable consequence of saving her from the factory,
				and leading her gently home to such shelter as her father's roof could give, would
				be to watch her perish there for want of food." </p>
			<p>"Alas! alas! is it thus my wealth has been accumulated?" exclaimed Miss Brotherton,
				shuddering. "Is there no power in England, sir, righteous and strong enough to stay
				this plague?"</p>
			<p>"Miss Brotherton!" returned the clergyman, "such power, and such righteousness, MUST
				be found, or this plague, as you well call it, will poison the very life blood of
				our political existence; and long ere any serious danger is likely to be dreamed of
				by our heedless rulers, the bloated wealth with which this pernicious system has
				enriched a few, will prove a source of utter destruction to the many. Never, my dear
				young lady, did the avarice of man conceive a system so horribly destructive of
				every touch of human feeling, as that by which the low-priced agony of labourine
				infants is made to eke out and supply all that is wanting to enable the giant
				engines of our factories to out-spin all the world! But you must see it, Miss
				Brotherton, you must watch it with you own eyes, you must follow the hateful
				operations of this atrocious system into the thousands of sordid and forgotten huts
				which cover its miserable victims, ere you can possibly understand its moral
				mischief. There is no strength, no power in words to paint it."</p>
			<p>"Its moral mischief," said Mary, eagerly; "explain that to me, Mr. Bell, for it is
				the point I find most puzzling — why is it that these poor factory-people, because
				they labour more unremittingly, as it should seem, than all the world beside, why,
				for this reason, instead of being honoured for their industry, are they invariably
				spoken of with contempt and obliquy?"</p>
			<p> "Your question, Miss Brotherton, involves by far the most terrible portion of this
				frightful commercial mystery," he replied; "but, as I have told you, nothing except
				personal investigation can enable the inquirer to arrive at the whole truth
				respecting it. Were a patient, accurate, and laborious detail of all the enormities
				committed, and all the <pb n="203"/> sufferings endured, under the factory system,
				to be presented to the public, it would be thrown aside by some, as greatly too
				tedious for examination, and by others as a statement too atrocious to merit belief.
				Yet, England MUST listen to it, and that soon, or she may mourn her negligence when
				it is too late to repair it. That marvellous machinery of which we make our boast,
				Miss Brotherton, is not more perfect in its power of drawing out the delicately
				attenuated thread which it is our glory to produce, then the system for reducing the
				human labour necessary for its production to the lowest possible price is, for
				degrading the moral nature of the helpless slaves engaged in it." </p>
			<p>"That the system has such a tendency I cannot doubt, after the repeated assurances
				which have reached me, that so it is," replied Mary. "Nevertheless, I am still
				unable to comprehend why it should be so."</p>
			<p> "You have only to take advantage of your residence near Ashleigh, Miss Brotherton,
				the dense population of which subsists almost wholly by factory labour, in order to
				understand, but too well, why this terrible result is inevitable. You are as yet too
				young a lady for me to expect that you should have very deeply studied the nature of
				the human mind, or made yourself fully aware how greatly the habits and character of
				all human beings depend upon education, and the circumstances in which they are
				placed. Nevertheless, if you turn your attention to the subject, you will not, young
				as you are, be long incapable of detecting the dangers which beset the hearts and
				souls of those whose unhappy destiny have made them factory labourers. The dark
				little circle in which they move from birth to death, from father to son, from
				mother to daughter, is so uniform, that almost any average individual case may
				fairly serve as a specimen of the whole class. Boys and girls, with few exceptions,
				labour indiscriminately altogether in the factories. While still almost children,
				they form connexions, and are married. Having worked in the mills, probably from
				five years old to the hour of their unweighed and thoughtless union, the boy assumes
				the duties of a husband with little more knowledge of moral or religious
				responsibility than the brute animal that labours with a thousand times less
				degradation in the fields; while the childish wife comes to her important task
				ignorant of every earthly usefulness, save what belongs to the mechanical drudgery
				in which throughout the whole of her short, sad life, she has been made to follow
				the uniform and ceaseless movements of machinery. She cannot sew, she cannot cook,
				she cannot iron, she cannot wash. Her mind is yet more untaught and undisciplined
				than her hands. She is conscious of no responsibility, she knows no law by which to
				steer her actions, or regulate her spirit, and becomes a mother as she became a
				wife, without one single thought of duty mixing itself with her increasing cares. By
				degrees, both the husband and the wife find employment in the factory less certain.
				It is for children, children, children, that the unwearied engine calls, and keenly
				does the hungry father, and the mother too, watch the growth of the little creatures
				to whom they have given birth, till the slight limbs have firmness enough to stand,
				and the delicate joints are sufficiently under the command of the frightened will to
				tie threads <pb n="204"/> together under the potent inspiration of the overlooker's
				strap. Then comes a state of deeper degradation still. The father is idle, for often
				he can get no work, and it is to the labour of his little ones that he looks for
				bread. Nature recoils from the spectacle of their unnatural o'erlaboured aspect as
				they return from their thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, hours of toil. He has not nerve
				to look upon it, and creeps to the gin-shops till they are hid in bed. The mother
				sees it all, and sternly screws her courage to the task of lifting their bruised and
				weary limbs upon their bed of straw putting into their mouths the food she has
				prepared, their weary eyes being already closed in sleep, and preparing herself to
				wake before the sun on the morrow, that with unrelenting hand she may drag them from
				their unfinished slumber, and drive them forth again to get her food. This is no
				varnished tale, Miss Brotherton, but the bare, naked, hideous truth. And can you
				wonder that beings thus reared and ripened should form a degraded class? Can you
				wonder that all others should turn from them, as from a race with whom they have
				nothing in common? If some sad accident, preceding birth, distrubs the beautiful
				process by which nature prepares the noble being she has made to be lord of all, and
				an abortive creature comes to life, curtailed of all its fair proportions, both of
				mind and body, all within reach of the hapless prodigy shudder as they mourn, and
				the best and wisest among them pray to God that its span of life be short. But
				believe me when I tell you, Miss Brotherton, that the effect which the factories of
				this district is producing upon above two hundred thousand of its population, is
				beyond all calculation more deplorable, and many a child is born amongst them whose
				destiny, if fairly weighed against that of such a one as I have described, would
				appear incomparably more terrible." </p>
			<p>"Can such things be, and the rulers of the land sit idly by to witness it?" cried
				Mary shuddering.</p>
			<p>"It seems as if the rulers of the land knew little, and cared less about it," replied
				Mr. Bell. "The profoundly ignorant opinion that there is some connexion between our
				national prosperity, and the enormous fortunes amassed by some score of
				North-country manufacturers has, I believe, produced much of the lamentable
				non-interference of which the disinterested few complain, who are near enough to
				look upon the frightful game. Some individual voices have been most gloriously
				raised on this tremendous theme, and if they will be steadfast and enduring, they
				must and will prevail — for human nature, with all its vices, is not framed to look
				coldly on such horrors, and permit them. But the remedial process is so slow — it is
				so difficult to arouse the attention, and awaken the feelings of busy men concerning
				things at a distance, whose connexion with all that they deem important they are too
				ignorant of, or too preoccupied to trace, that the keenest observers, and those who
				would the most deeply deprecate any remedy but a legal one, begin to fear that mercy
				will be clamoured for with very dangerous rudeness, before the parliament of England
				shall have roused up it wisdom to the task of affording it.</p>
			<p> "And in what way, Mr. Bell, is it wished, or hoped, that the legislature <pb n="205"/> should step forward to cure this dreadful evil? Is it proposed to abolish the use
				of machinery?" </p>
			<p>Mr. Bell smiled, and shook his head.</p>
			<p>"You perhaps think," said he, "that there is a great disproportion between my strong
				sense of the vice and suffering produced by the factory system, and the measure for
				its mitigation to which I now limit almost my wishes. But it would be vain to look
				back to the time when steam engines were not, and there would indeed be little
				wisdom in addressing our lamentations to their introduction. It is not the
				acquisition of any natural power, principle, or faculty, that we should deplore; all
				such, on the contrary, should be hailed as part and parcel of our magnificent
				birthright, and each new use we learn to make of the still much-unknown creation
				around us, ought to be welcomed with a shout of praise, as a fresh fulfilment of the
				supreme command 'replenish the earth and <hi>subdue</hi> it.' It is not from
				increased, or increasing science that we have any thing to dread, it is only from a
				fearfully culpable neglect of the moral power that should rule and regulate its
				uses, that it can be other than one of God's best gifts."</p>
			<p>"But how," demanded Mary, "how, if machinery continues to be used, can any Act of
				Parliament prevent the necessity of employing children to wait upon its operations,
				instead of requiring the strength of men, as heretofore, to perform what the
				steam-engine does in their place?"</p>
			<p>"No Act of Parliament can be conceived capable of inducing a manufacturer to employ
				the weaker, and at the same time the more costly agent, in preference to a more
				powerful and cheaper one," replied Mr. Bell. "No reasonable man would ask this, no
				reasonable man would desire it, and assuredly no reasonable man would attempt to
				enforce such an absurdity by law. No, Miss Brotherton, this mighty power, as surely
				given for our use as is the innocent air that fans the woodbine yonder, has at
				length, after some few thousand years of careless overlooking on our part, been
				revealed to us. But let us not fly in the face of benignant nature, and say like
				Caliban, "You taught me language; and my profit on't Is, I know how to curse." </p>
			<p>"If used aright the recannot be a doubt that this magnificent power might, in all its
				agencies, be made the friend of man. It requires no great stretch of ingenuity to
				conceive that it might be rendered at once a source of still increasing wealth to
				the capitalist, and of lightened labour to the not-impoverished operative. But that,
				as things are at present, this great discovery, and all the admirable ingenuity with
				which it is applied, acts as a ban instead of a blessing, upon some hundred
				thousands of miserable victims is most true, while all the benefit that can be shown
				as a balance to this horror, is the bloated wealth of a small knot of
				master-manufacturers. But so monstrous is this evil, that its very atrocity inspires
				hope, from the improbability that when once beyond all reach of contradiction its
				existence shall be known by all men, it should be permitted to continue."</p>
			<pb n="206"/>
			<p>"Then why is it not known?" demanded Mary, her colour heightened as she remembered
				her own entire ignorance upon the subject a few short weeks before, "surely it is
				the duty of all lookers-on to proclaim it to the whole world."</p>
			<p>"Alas! Miss Brotherton! It is more easy to raise a voice, than to command attention
				to it. Loud and long must be the cry that shall awaken the indifferent, and rouse
				the indolent to action. But this loud, long cry, will be uttered, and by the
				blessing of God it will be listened to at last."</p>
			<p>"But tell me Mr. Bell," resumed his deeply interested auditor, "what is this moderate
				enactment in mitigation of these wretched people's sufferings, which you say would
				content you?"</p>
			<p>"All that we ask for," replied Mr. Bell, "all that the poor creatures ask for
				themselves, is that by Act of Parliament it should be rendered illegal for men women
				and children to be kept to the wearying unhealthy labour of the mills for more than
				ten hours out of every day, leaving their daily wages at the same rate as now."</p>
			<p>"And would <hi>that</hi> suffice," demanded Miss Brotherton with astonishment, "to
				effectually relieve the horrors you have been describing to me?"</p>
			<p> "Miss Brotherton it would," replied the clergyman. "I would be loath to weary you
				with details," he continued, "but a few items may suffice to make you see how
				enormous are the benefits which would follow such an enactment. At present, if a
				large demand for manufactured goods arises, instead of being, as it ought, a
				blessing to the industrious hands that must supply it, it comes upon them as a
				fearful burden, threatening to crush the very springs of life in the little
				creatures that are chiefly to sustain it, while the golden harvest that it brings is
				not for them, but for their masters. For the miserable meed of an extra penny, or
				sometimes three-halfpence a day, the young slaves (who, observe, have no power of
				choice, for if they, or their parents for them, refuse, they are instantly turned
				off to literal starvation — no parish assistance being allowed to those who resist
				the regulations of the manufacturers), for this wretched equivalent for health and
				joy, are compelled, whenever our boasted trade flows briskly, to stand to their work
				for just as many hours as the application of the overlooker's strap, or
				billy-roller, can keep them on their legs. Innumerable instances are on record of
				children falling from excess of weariness on the machinery, and being called to life
				by its lacerating their flesh. It continually happens that young creatures under
				fifteen years of age, are kept form their beds all night. Fifteen, sixteen,
				seventeen, hours of labour out of twenty-four, are cases which recur continually,
				and I need not say with what effect upon these victims of ferocious avarice. Now not
				only would all this be mended, the positive bodily torture spared, and as far as is
				consistent with constant in-door occupation, the health of the labourers preserved,
				were it made unlawful to keep them at positive labour for more than ten hours of
				every day; not only would all this follow from the enactment, but innumerable other
				advantages, some of them more important still, would, <pb n="207"/> beyond all
				question,be its consequence. In the first place, were there no power of executing
				great and sudden orders by irregular exactions of labour, the recurrence of those
				fearful intervals when the starving operatives are thrown out of employ by the
				accidents which cause a deficiency in the demand, would not happen — for in that
				case the capitalists would find themselves obliged to be beforehand with the demand,
				even though some portion of their enormous wealth should for a time lie idle. From
				this would also follow the necessity of often employing adult hands, where now the
				cheaper labour of children, forced from their very vitals through the day and night,
				may be had for the sin of demanding it. Then would the unnatural spectacle of a
				stalwart father idly waiting to snatch the wages from the little feverish hand of
				his o'er-laboured child be seen no more. Then would there be strength and spirits
				left in the young to profit by the Sunday-schools now so often ostentatiously opened
				in vain, because the only way in which a little piecer can keep holiday is by lying
				throughout the day stretched upon his straw in heavy sleep. Then too, the
				demoralizing process by which the heart of a mother is rendered hard as the nether
				mill-stone, by the necessity of goading her infants to their frightful toil, would
				cease. Boys and girls would no longer have to return to their homes at midnight —
				there would be time and inclination then, for those comfortable operations of the
				needle and the shears, which 'Make old clothes look amaist as weel as new.' Then
				would not the disheartened ministers of God's church strive in vain to make the
				reckless, joyless, worthless race listen to his words of faith and hope. Then, Miss
				Brotherton, they would arise from that state of outcast degradation which has caused
				your friends to tell you that it would be 'unsafe, improper, and altogether wrong,'
				for you, and such as you, to make personal acquaintance with them." </p>
			<p>"And do you really think all this mighty, this glorious good, would follow from an
				enactment so moderate, so reasonable, so every way unobjectionable?"</p>
			<p>"I have not the slightest shadow of a doubt, Miss Brotherton, that such good would
				follow it, and more, much more, than I have named — more than any one could believe
				or comprehend, who has not, like myself, been watching for years the misery, the
				vice, the degradation, which have resulted from the want of it."</p>
			<p>"Then why, Mr. Bell, have not such representations been made to the legislature as
				must ensure its immediate adoption?"</p>
			<p> The good clergyman shook his head. "It is a most natural, question, my dear young
				friend — allow me so to call you. All are my friends who feel upon this subject as
				you appear to do. It is a most natural and a most obvious question. Yet would my
				reply be any thing rather than easy of comprehension were I to attempt to answer it
				directly. I sincerely hope I shall converse with you again on this subject.
				Documents are not wanting, my dear Miss Brotherton, to prove that all, or nearly
				all, that private individuals can do, in the way of petition and remonstrance, has
				been already tried; nor are we yet without hope that good may come of it. But it
				must be long, and perhaps the longer the better, ere <pb n="208"/> your young head
				and innocent heart, can conceive our difficulties. You would hardly believe the
				ingenious devices to which frightened avarice can have recourse in order to retard,
				mutilate, and render abortive a measure having for its object a reduction of
				profits, with no equivalent save the beholding smiles instead of tears, and hearing
				the sounds of song and laughter instead of groans!" </p>
			<p>"But while you are still waiting and hoping for this aid from our lawgivers," said
				Mary, "is there nothing that can be done in the interval to help all this misery,
				Mr. Bell?"</p>
			<p>"Nothing effectual, my dear young lady," he replied mournfully. "I may, with no
				dishonest boasting say, that my life is spent in doing all I can to save these
				unhappy people from utter degradation and despair. But the oppression under which
				they groan is too overwhelming to be removed, or even lightened, by any agency less
				powerful than that of the law. Nothing, in fact, can so clearly show the powerful
				oppression of the system as the total inefficiency of individual benevolence to heal
				the misery of those who suffer under it. Its power is stupendous, awful, terrible!
				Nature herself, elsewhere so omnipotent, here feels the strength of unchecked human
				wickedness, and seems to bend before it. For most certain is it, that in less than
				half a century, during which the present factory system has been in operation, the
				lineaments of the race involved in its are changed and deteriorated. The
				manufacturing population are of lesser and of weaker growth than their agricultural
				countrymen. The development of the intellectual faculties is obviously becoming
				weaker, and many whom we have every reason to believe understand the physiology of
				man as thoroughly as science can teach it to them, do not scruple to assert, that if
				the present system continues, the race of English factory operatives will dwindle
				and sink in the strongly-graduated scale of human beings, to something lower than
				the Esquimaux."</p>
			<p>"Gracious Heaven!" cried Mary, clasping her hands with an emotion that almost
				amounted to agony, "and all these horrors are perpetrated for the sake of making
				rich, needlessly, uselessly rich, a few obscure manufacturing families like my own!
				This is very dreadful sir," she continued, while tears burst from her eyes. "I have
				gained knowledge but not peace by my visit, and I must leave you with the sad
				conviction that the hope I had nourished of making my fortune useful to the
				suffering creatures among whom I live, is vain and idle."</p>
			<p> Mr. Bell listened to this melancholy assertion, and sighed because he could not
				contradict it. "Yes;" said he, at length, "it is even so; and if any proof were
				wanted of the depth and hopelessness of the wretchedness which the present system
				produces, it might be found in the fact, that despite the inclination I feel both
				for your sake, and that of the poor operatives, to encourage your generous
				benevolence, I cannot in conscience tell you that it is in your power effectually to
				assist them. That you may save your own excellent heart from the palsy of hopeless
				and helpless pity, by the indulgence of your benevolence in individual cases of
				distress, I need not point out to you; but that any <pb n="209"/> of the ordinary
				modes of being useful on a larger scale, such as organising schools, founding
				benefit societies, or the like, could be of any use to beings so crushed, so
				toil-worn, and so degraded, it would be idle to hope." </p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton now rose to depart — but as she extended her hand, and began to utter
				her farewell, it occurred to her that it was possible her new friend might, by
				conjecture at least throw some light upon the destination of little Michael, and
				avoiding as much as possible the making any direct charge against her rich
				neighbour, she briefly narrated the facts of Michael's adoption, dismissal, and
				unknown destination, with little commentary on either, but concluded by saying,</p>
			<p>"The mother of the child is in great anxiety about him, an though I cannot conceive
				it possible any harm can have befallen the boy, I am in some sort a fellow-sufferer
				with her in the anxiety which this mystery occasions, from having almost pledged
				myself to learn the place of his destination. Can you, dear sir, suggest to me any
				means by which this information can be obtained?"</p>
			<p>"Some part of this history has reached us already," replied Mr. Bell. "It has been
				somewhat industriously bruited through the neighbourhood, that Sir Matthew Dowling,
				notoriously one of the most tyrannical millocrats in the whole district, has been
				moved to kindness in behalf of some poor widow's son, and taken him to be reared and
				educated with his own children — I trust I am excusable, knowing what I know, for
				misdoubting the disinterested benevolence of any act of Sir Matthew Dowling's.
				Nevertheless it is certainly not easy to perceive why, after having so
				ostentatiously distinguished the boy, he should kidnap him, as it were, from his own
				house, in order to get rid of him. If, instead of being the object of especial
				favour, the little fellow had fallen under the rich knight's displeasure, Miss
				Brotherton, I should think it by no means improbable that he might have consigned
				him as an apprentice to some establishment, too notorious for its severity to make
				it desirable that his selection of it should be made known. But of this there seems
				neither proof nor likelihood."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton turned pale as she listened to this suggestion. "Nay, but there is
				both truth and likelihood in such a suspicion," she exclaimed with considerable
				emotion, and after a moment's consideration, added, "I know no reason why I should
				conceal the cause I have for saying so — if you know not all, how can you give me
				counsel?"</p>
			<p>Hurriedly, and as briefly as possible, Miss Brotherton then recounted the scene she
				had witnessed in the green-room of the Dowlinglodge theatricals, but there was an
				unconscious and involuntary fervour in her manner of narrating it, which rendered it
				impossible to listen with indifference, or not to feel at the recital some portion
				of the indignation she had felt when it occurred.</p>
			<p> "It must be looked to, Miss Brotherton," replied her warm-hearted new acquaintance.
				"The boy must be traced, tracked, found, and rescued. I think there are few of these
				wretched prison-houses of whose existence I am ignorant, and it is probable I may be
				able to help you in this. Should I obtain any hint likely to be useful in the <pb n="210"/> search, I will call upon you, if you will give me leave, to
				communicate it." </p>
			<p>Most earnestly and truly did the heiress assure him that it was impossible she could
				receive a visit more calculated to give her pleasure, adding that whether the hint
				were obtained or not, she trusted the acquaintance she had so unceremoniously began,
				would not drop here and that by returning her visit, he would prove to her that he
				was not displeased by it.</p>
			<p>It rarely happens between right-hearted people who meet for the first time, if one of
				the parties conceives a liking for the other, that it fails to prove mutual; and it
				was with a cordial sincerity, as genuine as her own, that Mr. Bell expressed his
				hope that their acquaintance would ripen into friendship.</p>
			<p>Too intently occupied by all that had passed, to remember her own arrangements, Mary
				forgot that her carriage was not at the door, and while these parting words were
				exchanged, walked forth, expecting to find it. It was Mrs. Tremlett who first
				recollected that the coachman had been ordered to put up his horses at the nearest
				inn, but this was not till they had traversed the little garden, and were already in
				the lane; for though the good nurse had been little more than <hi>personnage
					muet</hi> during the foregoing scene, she had taken a deep interest in it, and
				it was much with the air of one awaking from a dream, that she said, "My dear Miss
				Mary! you have forgot that the carriage is sent away."</p>
			<p>"Indeed have I!" said Mary, laughing, "and no wonder. But there stands our faithful
				William, he will tell us in what direction we may find it."</p>
			<p>"Will you not return, Miss Brotherton, while it is made ready?" said the
				clergyman.</p>
			<p>"Not if you will walk on with us, dear sir. The evening is delightful, but already
				quite far enough advanced to make it prudent not to lose any time." And having given
				orders that the carriage was to follow, they strolled on towards the turnpike.</p>
			<p>"There," said Mr. Bell, pointing to the towering chimneys of a large factory at some
				distance, "there, Miss Brotherton, is an establishment where, though carding and
				spinning go on within the walls, and some hundreds of children and young girls are
				employed in attending the machinery that performs the process, the voice of misery
				is never heard, for there the love of gold is chained and held captive by religion
				and humanity."</p>
			<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Mary, as she looked at the sinless monster to which he
				pointed. "It is not of necessity then, that this dangerous trade is fatal to all
				employed in it."</p>
			<p> "Certainly not. Were but its labours restricted both for young and old, to ten hours
				a day, there is no reason on earth why it should not be carried on with comfort and
				advantage to every individual concerned in it, and with credit, honour, and
				prosperity to the country. But you can hardly guess what up-hill work it is, when
				one good man has got to stand alone, and breast the competition to a whole host of
					<pb n="211"/> bad ones in his commercial enterprises. The high-minded owners of
				yonder factory are losing thousands every year by their efforts to purify this
				traffic of its enormities — and some thousand small still voices call down blessings
				on them for it. But while it costs them ten shillings to produce what their
				neighbours can bring into the market for nine, they will only be pointed at as
				pitiably unwise in their generation by all the great family of Mammon which
				surrounds them. Few, alas! will think of following the example! All they can do
				therefore is in fact but to carry on a system of private charity on an enormous
				scale — but till they are supported by law, even their vast efforts, and most noble
				sacrifices can do nothing towards the general redemption of our poor northern people
				from the state of slavery into which they have fallen. And yet I do believe, Miss
				Brotherton," he continued, after a pause, "I do most truly believe that these greedy
				tyrants would fail more rarely than now they do in their efforts to realize enormous
				wealth, if the system were to undergo exactly the change we ask for. The plan of
				under-selling may indeed in some few instances enable a very lucky man to run up a
				blood-stained fortune; and blood-stained it must be, for whenever this method of
				commanding a sale is pursued, and ruin does NOT ensue, it is demonstrable that the
				bones and marrow of children, working unlimited hours, must have been the main agent
				in the operation. But it is quite certain that the underselling system must upon the
				long run be ruinous. If all the losses upon our production were fairly set against
				all the gains from the immoderate working of young hands, the slavery scheme would
				appear as little profitable as holy. But here is your carriage, my dear young lady!
				God bless you! and may we live to rejoice together over an effectual legislative
				remedy for the evils we have passed this our first interview in deploring!" </p>
			<p>So saying, he extended his hand to assist her into the carriage which had already
				drawn up beside them — but Miss Brotherton stepped aside while he performed this
				office to her friend, and then laying her hand on his arm, drew him back a step or
				too to the spot from whence the factory chimneys he had pointed out to her were
				visible.</p>
			<p>"Tell me, before we part," she said, "the names of those to whom that building
				belongs?"</p>
			<p>" Wood and Walker ," replied the clergyman.</p>
			<p>"Thank you!" she replied; "I shall never hear those names without breathing a
				blessing on them!"</p>
			<p>Friendly farewells were once more exchanged, and the meditative heiress was driven
				back to Millford-park in silence so profound, that her old friend believed her to be
				asleep, and carefully abstained from any movement that might awaken her. But Mary
				Brotherton was not asleep.</p>

			<p>TRADE IN A FLOURISHING STATE — THE BENEFITS CONFERRED THEREBY TO THOSE EMPLOYED IN IT
				— THE NATURAL LOGIC OF RELIGION — ITS FALLIBILITY WHEN PUT TO THE TEST.</p>
			<p>
				The moment at which Michael Armstrong entered the cotton mill at
				Deep Valley, was a critical one. The summer had been more than commonly sultry, and
				a large order had kept all hands very sharply at work. Even at dead of night the
				machinery was never stopped, and when one set of fainting children were dragged from
				the mules another set were dragged from the reeking beds they were about to occupy,
				in order to take their places. The ventilation throughout the whole fabric was
				exceedingly imperfect; the heat, particularly in the rooms immediately beneath the
				roof, frightfully intense; cleanliness as to the beds, the floors, and the walls,
				utterly neglected; and even the persons of the children permitted to be filthy to
				excess, from having no soap allowed to assist their ablutions — though from the
				greasy nature of their employment it was peculiarly required, while the coarse meal
				occassionally given out to supply its place was invariably swallowed, being far too
				precious in the eyes of the hungry children to be applied to the purpose for which
				it was designed. In addition to all this, the food was miserably scanty, and of a
				nature so totally unfit to sustain the strength of growing children thus severely
				worked, that within a fortnight after Michael's arrival, an epidemic fever of a very
				alarming description began to shew itself. But it had made considerable progress,
				before the presence of this new horror was revealed to him.</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding all the hardships of Brookford factory, no infectious disease had
				ever appeared there, which it is possible might have been owing to the fact that the
				majority of the labourers in it lived at a considerable distance, thus insuring to
				them a walk morning and night, through the fresh air. This, though it added to their
				daily fatigue, probably lessened the danger of it, while the wretched hovels to
				which they returned for their short night's rest, miserable shelters as they were,
				reeked not with the congregated effluvia of fifty uncleansed sleepers in one
				chamber! Michael, therefore, had never before witnessed the hideous approach of
				contagion. The general appearance too of the Deep Valley troop was so far from
				healthy, that the sickly aspect of those first seized upon was less remarkable than
				it would have been elsewhere. Thus another week wore away, during which, though
				several of those who had been working when it began were withdrawn, and known to be
				in the sick-ward ere it closed, the fact that an infectious fever was among them had
				not yet got wing.</p>
			<p>"Poor dear Betsy Price!" whispered Fanny Fletcher to her friend Michael, as they sat
				side by side at their miserable dinner one day. "I heard missis tell master that she
				was dead. But I am trying to be glad for it Michael."</p>
			<p> "Glad, Fanny?" replied the boy, "you told me once that you <pb n="213"/> liked her
				more than any other girl in the mill, and now you are glad she is dead!" </p>
			<p>"I am not so glad as I think I ought to be," returned Fanny gently. "She will not be
				hungry in Heaven, Michael, nor will she work till she is ready to fall: and surely
				God will give us green fields and sweet fresh air in Heaven, and there must be
				flowers, Michael. Oh! I am quite sure of that, and Betsy Price will have it all!
				Ought I not to be very, very, glad?"</p>
			<p>Michael looked in her sweet, innocent face, as she said this, and tears filled his
				eyes.</p>
			<p>"And if you die, Fanny, must I be glad too?"</p>
			<p>"If you thought about Heaven as I do, and if you loved me very much indeed," replied
				the little girl, "I can't tell how you could help being glad."</p>
			<p>"But I do love you very much indeed," said Michael, almost choked by his efforts not
				to cry, "and I do think of Heaven, too, Fanny, but I could'nt be glad if you was to
				die!"</p>
			<p>"Not when you hear that, Michael!" said Fanny, starting up as the lash of the
				governor's whip resounded through the room as a signal that their numbered moments
				of rest were over. "I suppose then I love you better than you love me, for I could
				not help being glad if I knew that you would never hear nor feel that lash
				again!"</p>
			<p>When they met again at supper, Michael, though still unsuspicious of the cause,
				missed three more children from their places. He fancied, too, that there was
				something new and strange in the aspect of their hard-featured female tyrant; she
				was paler than usual, scolded not at all, and when she spoke to her husband, it was
				in a voice that hardly exceeded a whisper. Yet, notwithstanding this, some young
				ears again caught words that told of death. Yet still the mill worked on, and
				nothing seemed to mark that any calamity more than usual had got among them.</p>
			<p>By degrees, however, the growing pestilence burst forth, as it were, before the eyes
				of the terrified children, and they knew that the grave yawned before them all. Then
				it was that the ghastly countenances of each doomed victim struck dismay into the
				hearts of their companions even before they were permitted to leave their labour,
				and sink down to the rest that should be disturbed no more. But still the mill went
				on, for Mr. Elgood Sharpton had just received a glorious order from Russia, and it
				would have been perfect madness, as this gentlemen was heard to remark to his eldest
				son, if a death or two among the apprentice children was to check the mill at such a
				time as that.</p>
			<p>So the mill went on, and death went on too. But as it is considered by all parties
				concerned to be extremely important that the cry of epidemic contagion should not be
				raised in the neighbourhood of a factory under these circumstances, it was deemed
				best by Mr. Elgood Sharpton, and his confidential managers, not to call in medical
				assistance.</p>
			<p> "For first and foremost, Poulet," said the experienced proprietor to the governor of
				the apprentice house, "first and foremost, it is of <pb n="214"/> no manner of use.
				I never knew any proper, regular contagious fever in my life, that could be stopped
				short by a doctor. You must take care of yourself and your wife, of course, and I
				will see that you have a hamper of good old port sent in, and mind that you both of
				you take two glasses a day each, Poulet — one before you go into the rooms in the
				morning, and the other, after you have seen them all down for the night, and we must
				order in a cask of vinegar to sprinkle the chambers. Trust me that this will do more
				good than all the doctors that ever were hatched. Besides the vinegar cask will
				never sing out you know, Poulet, and the doctor might." </p>
			<p>To this reasoning, and to these arrangements, no objection whatever was made by the
				governor of the apprentice-house. Of athletic frame, and iron nerves, he grinned
				defiance at any danger that threatened his own person, rightly enough thinking,
				perhaps, that any disease to which his water-porridge-fed troop appeared peculiarly
				liable, would be little likely to attack himself.</p>
			<p>It was, however, not the least part of his wisdom upon this occasion, that he
				systematically paid as little attention to what was going on round him as possible.
				Had he made it a habit to look into the haggard faces of the drooping children, as
				one after another they pined, languished, and sunk, first into the horrible abyss of
				wretchedness called the sick-ward, and then into the grave, it is possible that he
				too might in some degree have been shaken. As it was, however, he went on so
				cleverly supplying the missing hands by recommending to the manager that one healthy
				child should do the work of two, and so cleverly, also, getting all that died by day
				buried by night, without making, as he said, any fuss or fidget about it whatever,
				that Mr. Elgood Sharpton felt him to be eminently deserving of an especial reward,
				and when fifteen children had been noiselessly buried, in Tugswell churchyard, he
				presented him with a Bank of England note for ten pounds, as a testimony of his
				esteem and gratitude for his very exemplary and praiseworthy behaviour. It fared not
				quite so well, however, with his wife. Whether it were that the poco-curante system
				was less within reach of her position than of his; or that her frame was less
				stoutly proof against the malaria with which she was surrounded, a visible change
				came over her about three weeks after this visitation had been first felt at the
				Deep Valley mills. Strong in constitution, and athletic in form, it seemed, however,
				no easy matter for disease itself to conquer her. The large dark eye grew dim, and
				sunk back behind her high cheek-bones by degrees. Her coarse firm-set features
				appeared to relax, and her active limbs to languish, for two whole days before she
				yielded herself to the invincible power that had seized upon her.</p>
			<p> It happened during this interval that Fanny Fletcher and Michael, in their eagerness
				to communicate to each other their observations on the rapidly-increasing sickness
				of their fellow-labourers, hung back together, as the frightened train swept on
				before the lifted lash of the governor, and permitted nearly all their companions to
				reach the mill ere they had left the supper-room. They were perhaps themselves
				unconscious <pb n="215"/> how much they were emboldened to this hardy defiance of a
				standing law by the unwonted stillness of tongue, and tameness of aspect observable
				in Mrs. Poulet. But if they fancied they were to escape entirely they were mistaken,
				for whilst the little girl was telling Michael that they ought always, at work, or
				not at work, to be thinking of God, who was perhaps thinking of them, and meaning to
				take them both up together to his own happy Heaven, just as she had laid her hand on
				his to enforce her words, and looking wistfully in his face pronounced aloud, "Do
				Michael, do!" the sick dragon stepped back on hearing them, from the passage that
				led into the kitchen, and turning her ghastly face full upon them, exclaimed, while
				her languid fist strove in vain to clench and raise itself, as in days of yore, to
				threaten castigation. </p>
			<p>"Do! you devil's imps! I'll do ye! Off to your mules or by — ." But ere she could
				finish the sentence, her fever-laden sinews relaxed, and seizing upon the long table
				for support she sank almost insensible upon a bench.</p>
			<p>Greatly terrified, both Michael and Fanny screamed together, but they screamed in
				vain. There was no longer any one within hearing save in the closely packed chamber
				above, where more than twenty sick children lay two and two together, in their
				miserable beds, but totally without nurses or attendants of any kind, so that their
				loud cries, though heard by many brought assistance from none.</p>
			<p>"Oh! Michael! Michael! she'll die too!" said Fanny shuddering. "I would make her live
				longer if I could. She is not fit to die. Go to the pump, Michael, and fetch water!
				Go, go, dear boy. We must not leave her this way!"</p>
			<p>The little girl endeavoured to raise the woman's head, which had sunk upon the table,
				but the effort was beyond her strength, and feeling after a moment's reflection that
				the best manner of assisting her would be to call others, she cried, "No, no! don't
				go Michael! Don't go for the water. It is no use my trying to hold her up, and
				besides we don't know if it is good for her or not. Oh dear! how dreadful bad she
				looks. Let us run away to the mill, Michael, and tell the master."</p>
			<p> The seizure of Mrs. Poulet, unlike every other, became, within an hour, from the
				time it was known, the theme of every tongue throughout the whole establishment. Had
				it been Mr. Elgood Sharpton himself it could not well have occasioned a greater
				sensation. The effect this produced throughout the sickly troop might have served as
				a proof of the wisdom of a government when it conceals the mischief it has brought
				upon an empire, from those who are likely to discuss it. The total silence which
				till now had been preserved among the managers and overlookers respecting the
				contagious nature of the malady which had got among the children, the absence of all
				medical attendance, and of all precautionary or medical measures in any way
				calculated to excite attention, had hitherto very successfully prevented rumour from
				doing her usual work on such occasions; and it is probable that this partial
				ignorance of their own danger considerably lessened its consequences; for it was <pb n="216"/> only one or two such thougthful, meditative little things, as Fanny
				Fletcher, who had began to remember having heard of infectious fevers, and to think
				that maybe it was something of that sort that had made Nos. 9, 16, 18, 19. &amp;c.,
				&amp;c., stay away so long, and that too, when the mill was so very busy. </p>
			<p>But when it became generally known that the awful strength of Mrs. Poulet was laid
				low, and when the words, "the fever have cautched her!" had once been pronounced
				aloud, the palpable image of the pale tyrant seemed to stand frowning in the midst
				of them, substituting his grisley hour-glass and scythe for the fist, and the frown
				he had conquered.</p>
			<p>The scene which followed this was very frightful. — Those upon whom infection had
				seized, sunk from their work at once, despite the goading thong which had hitherto
				kept them from dropping — as the spur and the lash sustain the failing post-horse.
				While those who were yet untouched looked in each other's faces as if to watch who
				next should fall. When the children from all the different floors of the fabric met
				together at their midday meal, the first thought of each seemed to be the finding
				out who was missing since last they assembled, and the shudder that followed the
				perceiving another and another, and another gone, ran along the shortening lines
				with an agony which grew more and more intense as their numbers lessened.</p>
			<p>When things had reached this state, Mr. Elgood Sharpton agreed with Mr. Poulet that
				it might perhaps be as well to let an apothecary from Tugswell visit the factory, to
				which reluctant decision two reasons strongly contributed. The first was, that
				though with his usual fore-thought he had divided his nocturnal burying between the
				churchyards of Tugswell and Meddington, the clergymen of both had declared that
				their frequency rendered it necessary that some inquiry should be made into the
				cause of so great a mortality — and the second was that the fact of the mistress of
				the apprentice house, being herself at the point of death from the same malady, must
				infallibly prove to the medical visitant that it was no treatment peculiar to the
				children which had occasioned it, but that it had come beyond all possibility of
				contradiction by the visitation of God.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless the medical gentleman ventured to declare that nothing would be so
				likely to stop the contagion as nourishing food; upon which the terrified
				manufacturer astonished all the butchers within his reach, by commanding a large
				supply of beef and mutton " <hi>good enough to make wholesome soup</hi> ," and
				before another ghastly week had passed away, the wisdom of this prescription became
				so evident that when settling accounts together at the end of it, Mr. Poulet hinted
				to his employer that he did not feel quite sure whether upon the whole a
					<hi>little</hi> better living for the apprentices might not pay.</p>
			<p>For all answer Mr. Elgood Sharpton put his finger to the sum total for provisions
				during the last week, and then turning back a page or two of the huge volume, did
				the same by the sum total of a former week.</p>
			<p> "True, sir, true enough," said Mr. Poulet, "but howsomever it <pb n="217"/> can't be
				denied, that if we go on this fashion we shall have no hands left to work with — and
				there would be but small profit in that sir." </p>
			<p>"My dear Poulet, you do not study the population returns as attentively as I do,"
				replied his enlightened master. "Just at this moment it may be very right to cram
				them for several reasons — the best being, observe, that by so doing we stop more
				mouths than their own. But as to going on in the same style of expense when this fit
				of dying and gossiping is over, it is quite out of the question, and I do beg that
				you will never mention the subject to me again. You can know little my good Poulet
				of the rate at which pauper children are multiplied, if you think it necessary to
				preserve them at this ruinous rate of expence. If there were all of them to die off
				before the end of the month, I would undertake to have their place supplied before
				the end of the next. You may take my word for it that no man ever succeeded in
				business who did not know how to make out an accurate balance between profit and
				loss. I know to a fraction what each of these 'prentice brats are worth, Poulet, and
				I can tell you that such weekly bills as these would speedily turn the tables
				against us."</p>
			<p>"In that case, sir, there is surely no more to be said," replied Poulet; and then
				changing the subject, he added, "In course, sir, you won't object to my missis being
				buried by day, instead of by night? Besides respect to her, sir, I think it would be
				quite as well, shewing all the country, you see, as how flesh is but grass for the
				high, as for the low, and making it manifest to all the country that it can't be no
				want of good nursing and comfort as causes the deaths at our mill."</p>
			<p>"Quite right, quite right, Poulet," replied the rapid-minded Mr. Sharpton, promptly;
				"I should not object even to stopping the mills for a couple of hours or so, and
				making all the hands follow as mourners, if you thought it would answer."</p>
			<p>"Why, as to that, sir," said the faithful servant, "I would not undertake to say that
				we should be able to get up much of a procession if we turned out the whole lot to
				choose from. They couldn't stand I should think, sir, without the mules to hold by,
				for so long together. They totter frightful, I can tell you, when they starts first
				to move to and fro, from factory to 'prentice-house, and back again, and I don't
				think there would be either credit or profit in making a show of them."</p>
			<p>"Well, well! do as you will, Poulet. I dont care a brass farthing whether they walk
				or stand; and I can't say when I built this factory, it was with any view to make a
				show, as you call it, of the young ladies and gentlemen to be employed in it."</p>
			<p>With a light laugh which challenged an answering laugh from the governor, widower as
				he was, Mr. Elgood Sharpton rose to depart. Poulet attended him to the outer gate,
				and held his stirrup while he mounted, reiterating his promises to do the best he
				could, and only stipulating for plenty of vinegar, and leave to use soap till the
				cold weather came in.</p>
			<p> Meanwhile, though a less proportion died of those who were seized with the malady,
				than before the improvement in the diet was introduced, the plague was as yet very
				far from being stayed. No day <pb n="218"/> passed without many fresh victims
				sinking under its influence, and it was no uncommon thing to see two or three
				wheelbarrows at a time, towards the evening of every day, conveying children from
				the factory to the apprentice-house who had fallen while following the machinery. </p>
			<p>For a whole week after the death of Mrs. Poulet, Michael and his friend Fanny, both
				continued as it seemed, unscathed, and many were the grave discussions between them,
				as to whether they ought to be sorry or glad that they were so — Fanny very steadily
				adhering to her first opinion, that if they had a great deal of love for each other,
				they would not let themselves be sorry, if one saw the other go away, and Michael as
				steadily persisting that right or wrong he must be so very sorry if Fanny went, as
				not to care at all how soon he followed after.</p>
			<p>The disinterested reasonings of the little girl were soon put to the proof. Michael
				looked so very ill one morning at breakfast, that even the iron-hearted Poulet told
				him he had best mount to the sick ward before it was needful to carry him; but
				Michael looked at poor Fanny, and saw such an expression of terror and misery in her
				countenance, that he could not help thinking she would change her mind about being
				glad, if he did not go into work along with her. So he told the governor that he
				wasn't bad at all, and had rather work than not; an assurance, which it could not,
				under any circumstances, be Mr. Poulet's duty to combat; and accordingly Michael got
				to his place in the mill, and spoke cheeringly to Fanny as he went along. But before
				the hour of dinner he was on the floor, and when the overlooker called to a
				stretcher to have him wheelbarrowed back to the 'Prenticehouse, Fanny Fletcher
				thought that she certainly did not love poor Michael Armstrong so much as she
				fancied she did, for that if the choice had been given her, she would a great deal
				rather have been taken ill herself. And spite of a strap that she saw coming towards
				her, and flourishing ready for duty in the air, she helped to drag the unresisting
				body of her poor companion from before the mules, and thoughtless and reckless of
				the consequences, sat down and held his head on her knee, till he was raised in the
				arms of the stretcher and carried off. It was then, and not till then, that her
				tears began to flow, and they flowed so fast, that she could no longer see the
				uplifted strap, nor was it till the blow had descended sharply on her arm that she
				was sufficiently mistress of her thoughts to remember, that there was at any rate a
				hope that it might be her turn next, and with this to comfort her, she yielded
				meekly to the arm that pushed her to her usual place, and resumed her occupation
				with more stedfast courage, than at that moment any other hope could have given
				her.</p>
			<p>But even this sad hope proved vain. Fanny Fletcher still continued one of the very
				few upon whom the contagion had no effect. For the first day or two after the
				removal of her friend, her mind, was almost wholly occupied by the expectation of
				feeling the same symptoms that she had witnessed in him; and when these came not,
				her thoughts reverted to the possibility of his recovering and coming again to work
				near her.</p>
			<pb n="219"/>
			<p>It was an established custom among those who alone could give information on the
				subject, never to permit any questionings concerning the sick, or if they were
				boldly hazarded, to give no other reply than a rebuke. So that day after day, and
				week after week elapsed, without her being at all able to guess, whether Michael
				were dead or alive. By degrees, however, all hope of seeing him return, faded from
				her mind, and then, poor little girl, she found out that people can't always wish
				truly and really for what they know to be best either for themselves or others. And
				day by day, though still the fever touched her not, she grew more pale, more thin,
				more melancholy. Now and then, indeed, it still occurred to her as possible that
				Michael might reappear again, as many had done after many days of sickness; but,
				alas! none had ever staid away so long as he had done! She had questioned many who
				had been ill concerning him, but none seemed to know or care any thing about those
				who had shared the sick chamber with them; till at length, a boy to whom she had
				often addressed these questions, because she happened to know that he had been taken
				to the sick ward on the same day as Michael, replied as if by a sudden effort of
				recollection,</p>
			<p>"Oh! that chap? Him what was one of the last as come? Ay, ay, I mind all about him.
				He was dead and buried before he had been down three days."</p>
			<p>Fanny Fletcher asked no more questions, nor had she any longer hope of following
				where so many of her happier companions were gone. The fever was pronounced to be
				over, the Factory and Apprentice-house were whitewashed, and a number of new inmates
				arrived. All things in short at the Deep-Valley Mills appeared to be going on as
				prosperously as usual; a statement which could be hardly impeached by the fact that
				one little girl there was growing paler and more shadow-like every day.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XXI. </head>
			<p>MISS BROTHERTON EXERTS HER ELOQUENCE, AND NURSE TREMLETT IS BROUGHT TO REASON THEREBY
				— THE HEIRESS HARDENS HER HEART, AND SPEAKS HARSH TRUTHS TO MARTHA DOWLING, BUT ALL
				IN VAIN — SHE CONCEIVES A PROJECT, AND SETS ABOUT PUTTING IT IN EXECUTION WITH GREAT
				SPIRIT.</p>
			<p>" Well , my dear Mary,!" said Mrs. Tremlett, on sitting down
					<hi>tête-à-tête</hi> with Miss Brotherton, after their return from Fairly,
				"don't you think that you will come at last to confess that I was right when I told
				you that you had better let things alone, and not attempt to make any fuss or stir
				about these factory goings on?"</p>
			<p>Mary looked sick at heart, and only shook her head in reply.</p>
			<p> "Why, what have you gained, my dear child, by all your labour and <pb n="220"/>
				pains to get information, as you call it? You are looking as white as a sheet — your
				eyes are sunk in your head — when I look at you, instead of the smiles you used to
				give me, I get nothing but sighs, and all for what? Can you in honesty and truth say
				that you have gained any thing worth knowing by following your own opinion instead
				of mine? What good in the world can you do, dear, by listening to all the shocking
				stories that clergyman there told you? I dare say he is a very good man, and he
				looks like it, but upon my word I think he is doing nothing but just wasting his
				time, as well as yourself; for though I sat and said nothing, as of course it was my
				place to do, I listened to every word, and it is just because I believe every word
				was true, that common sense makes me see there's no good to talk about it. Indeed,
				and indeed, my darling, I would not make free to talk to you in this way, which
				looks for all the world as if I was taking advantage of your goodness to me, if I
				did not see that you was going the way to torment yourself for everlasting, without
				doing one bit of good to any one. For how, my dear, can you, or that good clergyman
				either, hope to put down all the wicked doings he told about? And to be sure he said
				as much himself — didn't he Miss Mary? Then do make up your mind to be quiet and
				happy, and let things that you can't mend, alone. Put as many children to school as
				you like, my dear, and you may give them a pretty neat uniform, you know, and that
				will be a pleasure for you to think about, and to look at; but for pity's sake my
				dear, dear, child! give up at once, and for ever, this bothering yourself for
				everlasting about the factories, which you can no more stop, Mary, than you can stop
				the sun from rising in the morning, and setting at night." </p>
			<p>Here the good woman ceased, and looked with some anxiety in the thoughtful eyes of
				her young mistress. She felt that she did not understand their expression, and no
				wonder, for Mary Brotherton herself sat silently doubting how she should answer her.
				A languid feeling, proceeding partly from fatigue and indisposition, and partly from
				the discouraging conviction that she had no very satisfactory arguments by which to
				rebut her old friend's charge of useless devotion to a hopless cause, made her for
				some minutes unwilling to speak at all. Then came a somewhat peevish wish to
				interdict for ever the discussion of the subject between them; but as she raised her
				eyes to utter it, she encountered a look of such humble love, deprecating her
				displeasure, yet fondly clinging to the freedom which risked the incuring it, that
				her purpose suddenly changed, and instead of the chilling command she was
				meditating, she threw her arms round the old woman's neck, exclaiming,</p>
			<p>"Oh! my dear nurse! How much, how very much you must love me! since care for my
				already too-much-cared-for peace and quiet, can harden such a heart as yours towards
				all the sufferings we have this day heard recounted!"</p>
			<p> "Thank God! you are not angry," cried the affectionate old woman kissing her, and
				then arranging the neglected ringlets of her pretty charge, and looking cheerily in
				her face, she said, "Now then, Mary, <pb n="221"/> I won't teaze you any more about
				it. You are so sweet and so gentle to me, that I am quite sure you will not long
				think my heart <hi>is</hi> hard; and then by degrees you will find out that I am
				right; and then all will go well again, and I shall see my dear girl look like
				herself once more." </p>
			<p>"Nurse Tremlett! the time is already come when the impossibility of my efforts being
				of any avail to stem the torrent with which avarice and cruelty are overwhelming the
				land, is made evident to me. So much, dear nurse, I concede to you, and therefore on
				that point we will argue no more. But, my dear old woman, have patience with me if I
				tell you that there are some points on which my reading may have given me, young as
				I am, as much, or even more information than your experience has given you. You have
				heard of the slave trade, nurse Tremlett — you have heard more than one excellent
				charity sermon preached in aid of the funds that were to assist in freeing these
				poor helpless black people from the tyranny of their masters, and I suppose you know
				that it is now unlawful to buy and sell these poor creatures. And how do you think
				this happy change in their favour has been brought about?"</p>
			<p>"By the king and the parliament, Miss Mary, making that most good and righteous law,"
				replied nurse Tremlett.</p>
			<p>"And how were they persuaded to make that law, think you?" demanded Mary.</p>
			<p>"I can't tell how that was brought about, my dear. I suppose it was because they saw
				that it was right and fit."</p>
			<p>"It was brought about, nurse Tremlett, by the voices of the people of England, which
				were for years raised quietly, and with no breach of law or order, but with patient
				and unshrinking perseverance against this great sin, till the lengthened cry could
				be no longer resisted, and the law they perseveringly asked for, was granted to
				them. Do you think, nurse Tremlett, that if during these years of orderly, but
				steady remonstrance, every Englishman and woman had acted upon the principle you
				recommend, and had turned their thoughts and their conversation from the subject of
				negro slavery, because each one knew that he or she individually possessed no power
				to stop it. Do you think that if such had been the system acted upon, England would
				now have to boast of having abolished this most wicked traffic?"</p>
			<p>"Perhaps not, my dear. I think I understand you now," replied the honest-hearted old
				woman, eagerly.</p>
			<p>"Then now my dear old friend we shall, I think, never have any more disputes upon
				this subject. You — I — every servant in my house — every acquaintance I have in the
				world, may aid and assist in putting an end to this most atrocious factory system,
				WHICH OUGHT TO WEIGH HEAVIER UPON EVERY CHRISTIAN ENGLISH HEART THAN EVER THE
				SLAVE-TRADE DID. If the whole British empire, nurse, did but know what we are about
				here — if the facts we heard from Mr. Bell to-day were but impressed upon the minds
				of all my fellow-subjects as they are on mine, the horrors he detailed would cease
				before another year was come and gone."</p>
			<pb n="222"/>
			<p>"God forbid then, my sweet child, that I should ever more raise my sinful voice to
				drown your righteous one. I have been a vain self-sufficient old woman, my dear
				Mary, and clearly have been talking a great deal about that of which I know nothing.
				Only don't think I am cruel and hard-hearted; for though I do — as you truly say —
				though I do love you very very much indeed, I am not such a wretch as to hear all we
				were told to-day without wishing to mend it."</p>
			<p>This was the last time Mary Brotherton had to do battle with her nurse on the subject
				of the factory system. Once awakened to a sense of its tyranny and injustice, and
				made to feel that the only hope of remedy lay in the possibility of universally
				raising British feeling against it, there was no danger that the right-hearted old
				woman would ever again turn with indifference, weariness, or displeasure, from the
				theme. Her young mistress felt that she had touched the right string, and that she
				should never again have to fear discord where it was so essential to her comfort to
				find harmony. This change was really a comfort, and she felt it to be so, removing
				as it did one irksome feature from her situation, and for a few minutes it cheered
				her, and she said so, cordially, but the next, a pang shot to her heart, as she
				rememebered that this assurance of accordant counsels with her venerable nurse,
				could avail her nothing in the most painful of all her difficulties, for it promised
				no help either in obtaining light upon the mystery of poor Michael's abode, or in
				the still more pressing embarrassment of confessing to his unhappy mother and
				brother the impossibility of obtaining it. Yet this painful task must be performed,
				and that without delay, for well she knew that every hour that passed without their
				seeing her, would be rendered dreadful, both by the agony of fear, and the sickening
				hot and cold fits of uncertainty. But never had she felt herself so very a coward as
				while meditating this visit of the morrow. She saw in imagination the eager
				questioning of Edward's speaking eyes, and the heavy glance of his mother,
				anticipating the worst she had to tell.</p>
			<p>Sometimes she thought she would await the coming of the boy to take his place in the
				school, and let him report the failure of all her inquiries to the poor widow. But
				there was a selfish cowardice in this which instantly struck her, and she seemed to
				hate herself for the suggestion. For above an hour after she had laid her head upon
				her pillow these thoughts kept her painfully awake, and it was only after deciding
				that she would once more see Martha Dowling, and try the effect of repeating to her,
				but without quoting her authority, the dark hints she had listened to, respecting
				Sir Matthew's possible motives. It was only when her restless thoughts had fixed
				themselves on this, that she at length closed her aching eyes in sleep.</p>
			<p> Above an hour before the usual hour of rising, Mary Brotherton was already at her
				writing desk. The idea of going to Dowling-lodge, and encountering the knight and
				his family, was intolerable, and she had therefore recourse to her pen as the means
				of obtaining the interview <pb n="223"/> she wished for, without paying for it the
				penalty of such a visit. She wrote as follows: </p>
		<quote>	<p>"My dear Miss Martha,</p>
			<p>"I trust you are too goodnatured to be angry with me, even if you should think that I
				am taking a great liberty with you. But the truth is, that I much wish for the
				pleasure of seeing you, and yet am too idle this morning to venture upon a drive.
				Will you then have the great kindness to pass the morning with me here? I send my
				carriage, lest Lady Dowling should not have one at leisure to send with you.</p>
			<p>
				"Believe me, my dear Miss Martha,
			</p>
			<p>"Yours very sincerely, " Mary Brotherton ."</p></quote>
			<p>Having written, folded, and sealed this epistle, Mary recollected that it would be
				impossible to send it for at least four hours, and she smiled first, and then
				sighed, as she thought of the restless but useless activity which had caused her so
				needlessly to forestall her usual hour of rising. It would, in truth, have been
				better for her, poor girl, could she have slept through the time, for her waking
				thoughts had little that was pleasant to rest upon. Even the commencement of
				Edward's studies, to which she had before looked forward with great delight, now
				recurred to her only to bring the recollection that if she saw him, his thoughts
				would be neither of his new clothes nor his new books, but of Michael, and of her
				promise to get tidings of him. For his sake, and her own too, she determined at
				least to escape this interview, feeling that it would be better for all parties that
				no tidings should be delivered to both mother and son at once, which could be done
				after his school hours, by her driving to Hoxley-lane, after she had taken Martha
				home.</p>
			<p>In pursuance of this resolution, she walked to the school-house, renewed her orders
				that the greatest attention should be paid to the new scholar, Edward Armstrong, and
				care taken that if he were found backward for his age, he should neither be laughed
				at nor chid. She then left a message for him, stating that she should be engaged all
				the morning, but would see him at his mother's house, after he left school.</p>
			<p>At eleven o'clock Miss Brotherton's equipage set off for Dowlinglodge, bearing her
				letter to Martha, and the interval till its return was an anxious one. First she
				felt doubtful if her unusual invitation would be accepted; and if it were, she felt
				more doubtful still as to the nature of the scene which must follow. Nothing short
				of her earnest wish to redeem her promise to Mrs. Armstrong could have given Mary
				courage to do what she now meditated.</p>
			<p> She entertained not the slightest doubt of the intrinsic excellence of Martha
				Dowling. All she had ever seen of her, and still more, all she had heard from the
				Armstrongs, convinced her of this; and to pain her therefore, particularly in that
				most tender point, the exposure of <pb n="224"/> her father, the tremendous effect
				of which upon her, Mary had already witnessed, was one of the very last measures she
				could have been led to adopt. But a strong and stern feeling of justice, urged her
				not to shrink from this. It was evident from the statement of Mrs. Armstrong that
				Martha had been actively instrumental in sending Michael to his present destination,
				let it be where it might; and painful or not painful, it was unquestionably right to
				make her understand the doubts that existed as to the boy's well-being, in order
				that she might avail herself, as she was bound to do, of her access to the only
				person who could explain the transaction. </p>
			<p>Having screwed her courage, therefore, to the strictness of examination necessary to
				her most righteous purpose, Mary left her boudoir in the possession of Mrs.
				Tremlett, and repaired to the library to await her guest. Nor did she wait long.
				Almost before the time arrived at which she had calculated that the carriage might
				return, the great house-bell gave signal of a visiter, and the next moment Martha
				Dowling stood before her.</p>
			<p>The two young girls shook hands, and each observed that the other looked paler than
				she was wont to do. The heart of Mary sank within her as she marked the expression
				of Martha's countenance. Not only was it pale, but most speakingly anxious, and in
				addition to her usual shy and reserved manner there was an appearance of uneasiness,
				and almost of fear, as she thought, which seemed to tell that her object was
				suspected. Nor was she wrong. In pursuance of a promise given to Michael, Martha had
				visited the widow Armstrong, and the intense anxiety under which she found her
				suffering respecting the destination of her boy, awakened for the first time in her
				own mind a shadowy suspicion that all might not be right concerning him. The pang
				this cost her was terrible. Good and kind-hearted as she was, there was no strength
				of fibre in Martha's character which might enable her to brave every thing rather
				than remain in doubt. She loved her father fondly, but she feared him more, and the
				stronger her suspicions grew (and unhappily the more she meditated the more they
				strengthened), the less power she felt either to refute or confirm them.</p>
			<p>The note of Miss Brotherton was delivered to her at the family breakfast table, and
				the instant she read it, the truth suggested itself to her mind. Had she been a free
				agent, the wounded shrinking spirit of the poor girl would have certainly led her to
				invent some excuse for refusing an invitation so full of terror; but she was
				not.</p>
			<p>"What's that about, Martha?" said Sir Matthew, holding out his hand for the note.</p>
			<p>"It is from Miss Brotherton," muttered Martha, as she resigned it to him.</p>
			<p>"Mercy on me!" exclaimed her eldest sister," what a wonderful fancy Miss Brotherton
				seems to have taken for Martha! I do think it is the very oddest thing I ever heard
				of."</p>
			<p>"What a goose you are, my dear, not to understand it!" observed Miss Harriet, the
				second sister, giving at the same time a very significant glance towards her brother
				Augustus.</p>
			<pb n="225"/>
			<p>"But good gracious!" retorted Miss Arabella, why might not any other of us do as
				well? It would seem so much more natural in such an elegant and fashionable girl as
				she is."</p>
			<p>"She is afraid of us, Bella," replied Miss Harriet, tittering.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew, who had not only read the note, but contrived to hear all that his two
				eldest daughters said concerning it, here burst into a laugh.</p>
			<p>"Set a thief to catch a thief — hey! Harriet? Come Martha! start away! You have
				finished your breakfast long ago. I won't have the carriage kept waiting."</p>
			<p>"Must I go, papa?" said poor Martha, turning very pale.</p>
			<p>"Must you go? and with that die-away look too? Why, Martha! are you jealous, because
				some folks fancy that the young lady wants to make friends with you, for more
				reasons than one?"</p>
			<p>"I would a great deal rather not go, papa!" replied Martha in a beseeching
				accent.</p>
			<p>"Martha! I shall be in a downright passion with you in half a minute. Upon my honour
				I never heard any thing so cross-grained and unsisterly in my life. Go this moment,
				and get on your bonnet, and remember if you please, from first to last, to speak of
				your brother as a sister ought to speak. And if she hints any thing about his having
				flirted a little with Carry Thompson, be sure to say that he only did it to laugh at
				her."</p>
			<p>As he spoke these words, Sir Matthew rose from the table, as if to accelerate the
				movement which was to send her off.</p>
			<p>Martha listened to him with the habitual reverence which she ever bestowed on all he
				uttered; but shook her head, as it seemed, involuntarily, as he concluded.</p>
			<p>"Why you don't mean to say he was in earnest, you good-for-nothing spiteful girl!"
				cried Lady Dowling, suddenly rousing herself from the dignified apathy in which she
				usually indulged.</p>
			<p>"What a shame!" cried one sister.</p>
			<p>"That's too bad!" cried the other.</p>
			<p>"Just like her, though!" sneered Mr. Augustus.</p>
			<p>"Hold your tongues, all of you," said Sir Matthew, "I know Martha better than any of
				ye, trust me for that, and what I bid her do, that she will do, and nothing else.
				Run away Martha. Don't mind any of 'em."</p>
			<p>Thus urged, thus goaded to the interview she dreaded, Martha hastened to leave the
				room; but ere she passed the door, something at her heart told her that her best
				course would be to take her father apart, and tell him all. She turned back to look
				at him, but met a frown so strongly indicative of growing impatience at her delay,
				that yielding to the sort of slavish feeling in which she had been nurtured, she
				hurried forward to obey him. Had she possessed greater moral courage, many
				subsequent events would have been different.</p>
			<p> After the first salutation was over, Miss Brotherton, making a strong mental effort
				to subdue her agitation — of which she was infinitely more <pb n="226"/> capable
				than her companion — begged her to sit down; and then, placing herself where she
				could have, as a commentary on what she might induce her to say, the advantage of
				watching her countenance, she pronounced in a voice that she in vain laboured to
				render steady, "My dear Miss Martha, I have suffered a great deal of uneasiness
				since I last saw you respecting the little boy for whom — concerning whom — I mean
				Michael Armstrong, Martha! His mother is very wretched because she cannot discover
				to what place he has been sent; and I, nothing doubting that it would be perfectly
				easy to learn this from you, rashly promised that I would obtain this information.
				Can you, dear girl! tell me more upon this subject now, than you could when last we
				met?" </p>
			<p>"I cannot, Miss Brotherton!" replied Martha Dowling, in a voice so low and husky, as
				hardly to be audible, but with a complexion and features that spoke so plainly what
				was passing in her heart, that Mary felt ashamed of having placed herself where she
				could so distinctly read all she suffered, and leaving her chair to share the sofa
				on which the poor girl was seated, she took her hand and said,</p>
			<p>"My poor dear Martha! It would be better for us both that I should speak sincerely. I
				have become acquainted with an individual, Martha, who knows more, much more, than
				either you or I can do, my dear girl, respecting the factories — those great
				magazines of human life and labour by which your father, and mine also, have grown
				from poverty to wealth. This person, Martha, on my questioning him respecting the
				probable destination of a child so circumstanced, did not scruple to reply, that if
				his master were displeased, and wished to be rid of him, there were places —
				factories, mills, dear Martha, where the business was so managed as to render labour
				very heavy, punishment, and where it was easy to keep children, ay, hundreds of
				them, unseen and unknown for years. Do not tremble thus, dear Martha! Do not draw
				your hand away from me! Most sure I am that your heart and my heart must beat in
				sympathy on such a subject as this. Let us be mutually sincere, and we may help each
				other to undo whatever wrong may have been done. We know, we both well know, that
				your father <hi>was</hi> displeased with this poor widow's son. We know, too, that
				he is a person of great power and influence. The boy is gone — he will not tell us
				where. What is the inference? Turn not from it, Martha Dowling, turn not from it, my
				poor friend, but boldly and honestly seek out the truth, and let me know enough of
				it to save this helpless child from further suffering."</p>
			<p>"I have no means, Miss Brotherton," faltered poor Martha. "If all your dreadful
				thoughts were true, which you have no right to think they are — and still less have
				I — but if they were true, all true, I have no means to know it."</p>
			<p> "If we have ANY reason to believe them true," said Mary, solemnly, "means MUST be
				taken, Martha Dowling, to stop further wrong; and this can only be by learning where
				Michael Armstrong has been sent. I apply to you for this with great reluctance,
				because I know the subject <pb n="227"/> cannot be brought before you without
				causing you pain. But I feel it my duty not to shrink from this, and it is yours, my
				dear girl, to obtain the information I require." </p>
			<p>"But if I agreed with you in this, Miss Brotherton, what are my means of obtaining it
				beyond your own?" said Martha, rousing herself, and feeling renewed courage from
				remembering that there was no proof whatever of the boy's being otherwise than well
				and happy.</p>
			<p>"Nay, Martha," returned the heiress gravely, "amongst those engaged in your father's
				service, you can hardly be at a loss to find some one who must have been employed in
				removing him."</p>
			<p>"And would you have me," replied the poor girl, indignantly, "would you have me
				tamper with my father's servants, in order to obtain a knowledge of what it may be
				his will to keep secret? Miss Brotherton, I would rather die than do so."</p>
			<p>"I honour your filial feelings, Martha, and grieve to think that you are placed in
				circumstances which must compel you to make them secondary," said Mary, gently.</p>
			<p>"Nothing can make them secondary," retorted Martha, warmly, "I love my father, and I
				hold my duty to him the first and the highest I have to perform on earth."</p>
			<p>"Save only what you owe to your own soul, Martha Dowling," replied Mary. "Had you
				been yourself for nothing in this matter, I might think as you do, that your duty as
				a child must prevent your interfering in it, though even that, I suspect, would be
				but doubtful morality. But, Martha! the case is otherwise. It was by your influence
				that this helpless widow was induced to send her child away. She did <hi>not</hi>
				trust your father, but she trusted you. Do you not know, Martha, that I speak the
				truth? And if I do, can you for an instant doubt that your first duty is to redeem
				the pledge you gave to this poor trusting creature, who hazarded all that was
				dearest to her in life, upon your assurance?"</p>
			<p>A passionate burst of tears, that seemed rather to convulse than relieve the bosom on
				which they fell, was the only answer Mary received to her cogent reasonings, and so
				evident was the suffering of the innocent culprit who appeared writhing under the
				discipline she inflicted, that nothing less deeply impressed on her heart than was
				the remembrance of Edward and his mother, and the grief that threatened to destroy
				them both, could have given her courage to persevere.</p>
			<p>"Martha! dear Martha! Be reasonable!" cried Mary, throwing her arms round her. "If
				you knew what I suffered in making you suffer, you would pity me! But I have no
				choice left me. I am not a free agent, Martha, any more than you are; we are both
				bound in honour, honesty, Christian faith, and Christian mercy, not to let any
				feeling stop us till we have restored Michael Armstrong to his mother."</p>
			<p>"Restore him!" sobbed Martha. "Alas! Miss Brotherton, the poor woman herself has
				prevented the possibility of that! Do you not know that he is apprenticed?"</p>
			<p> "Let us but know <hi>where</hi> he is, Martha, and if the situation be one <pb n="228"/> that his mother can reasonably disapprove, there can be little doubt
				but means may be taken to release him. Teach us but where to find him, dearest
				Martha," cried Mary fervently, "and we will all pray for blessings on your head!" </p>
			<p>"I cannot do it," replied Martha, with a sigh that very nearly approached a
				groan.</p>
			<p>"How know you that you cannot, Martha? Will you not try to learn this cruel, this
				nefarious secret?"</p>
			<p>"No, I will not, Miss Brotherton," replied the unhappy girl with sudden firmness. "If
				any wrong has been done to this boy, I know that it must rest upon my head. So let
				it. The remembrance of it may bring me to the grave, and there I shall find mercy
				and forgiveness. But it shall not place me in rebellion to my father, nor force me
				to reveal any secrets which it may be his pleasure to keep. Now let me go, Miss
				Brotherton. I doubt not you have acted according to your sense of duty, and so have
				I. In this at least we are equal. Pray let me go; I am not well and greatly wish to
				be at home."</p>
			<p>Mary looked at her with surprise, and almost with terror; she was as pale as death,
				and shook, as she stood up before her, as if she had been seized with an
				ague-fit.</p>
			<p>"Alas, Martha!" she exclaimed, "I have made you very miserable, and very ill, yet
				have gained nothing by it! You shall go, my poor girl, you shall go instantly, but
				ere we part, let me implore you to examine in silence, and alone, the question of
				right and wrong in this case. Paint to yourself the misery of the wretched mother,
				and remember that yourself — I must say it, though I wring both our hearts as I do
				it — yourself, Martha Dowling, are the cause of it."</p>
			<p>"You have said enough, Miss Brotherton, to destroy my peace for ever," replied the
				miserable girl, "but not enough to make me act as a spy upon my father. Farewell! Do
				not let us meet again! It is too painful."</p>
			<p>Without waiting for an answer, Martha Dowling wrapped her shawl about her and hurried
				to the door.</p>
			<p>"The carriage is not waiting, Miss Dowling," said the vexed and disappointed Mary,
				who had gained nothing from this painful interview, but the conviction that the
				well-intentioned, but erring Martha, was as much persuaded of the boy's having been
				unfairly dealt with, as herself. "Let me order the carriage for you."</p>
			<p>"No, no, I cannot wait. I can walk. I know the way. Indeed I can stay no longer!"
				replied Martha, hurrying on, and closing the door of the room after her, and before
				Miss Brotherton could reopen it, she had already passed through the hall, and was
				almost running from the house.</p>
			<p> Mary lost not a moment in summoning a servant, and ordering the carriage to follow
				her with all speed, an order which was so well obeyed, that the unhappy Martha was
				overtaken ere she had walked a mile, and gladly did she then avail herself of it;
				for by that time every other painful feeling was merged in the terror of having to
				explain to her father the cause of her having so parted with Miss Brotherton, <pb n="229"/> as to return unattended and on foot. "Perfect love casteth out fear,"
				and perfect fear may perhaps petrify the heart into a sort of unstruggling
				desperation; but a union of the two reduces the mind to a state of slavery the most
				abject, leaving no strength whereby any healthful moral feeling can be sustained.
				Martha's whole care, on returning home, was to satisfy her father that
					<hi>nothing</hi> particular had passed in her interview with the heiress; and,
				unfortunately for all parties, she succeeded. </p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton, meanwhile, mounted a little pony phaeton with Mrs. Tremlett, and
				with a heavy heart proceeded to Hoxley-lane. But, painful as was her errand, her
				condition was a far happier one than that of Martha Dowling; for in her there was no
				mixture of motives to paralyze every word and act. Her kind heart sought and found
				counsel in her sound and upright judgment, and, sustained by it, she executed her
				task without shrinking. A little reflection on the subject convinced her that it was
				now become her duty to confess to her poor client, not only that her exertions to
				discover the abode of Michael had been unsuccessful, but that she began to fear that
				there must be some unpleasant reason for the difficulties thrown in the way of
				obtaining the information she had sought. It required some courage to utter this;
				but when it wasdone, Mary was surprised to perceive that its effect, both upon the
				mother and son was very trifling. Having candidly stated her fears, she remained
				silent, the eyes of both being fixed upon her with a sort of quiet hopelessness that
				was perhaps more painful to contemplate than more vehement demonstrations of
				grief.</p>
			<p>"Our thanks are not the less due to you, ma'am," said the widow gently, "and don't
				vex your kind heart by thinking that we are disappointed. Edward and I guessed true
				from almost the first; that is, from when he was taken off without bidding us
				good-bye. Sir Matthew is known better by his mill people, ma'am, than by the great
				gentry that turns their eyes away from labour and sorrow, to revel and grow fat upon
				our graves. You would never be like to hear the truth from them, and I am told that
				even now, the country round rings with praises of Sir Matthew's goodness to Michael.
				'Tis bitter to hear it. But it is God's will our portion should be bitter here. He
				has power to make it up to us hereafter, and it is there we must fix our hope."</p>
			<p> "Most sure and most blessed is that hope!" replied Mary, fervently, "yet it should
				never check our efforts to put to profit the means of happiness he has granted to us
				here. I have now told you the very worst, Mrs. Armstrong, for I have told you not
				only all I know but all I fear — nor will I again pledge myself to do more than I am
				quite sure it is in my power to perform. I think you will believe, without my
				talking about it, that I shall not give up the search I have undertaken. But till
				some new light reaches us, we should but waste our time, and wear our spirits by
				speaking on the subject. Let us rather think and speak of the welfare of the dear
				boy that is left you; this will be no hindrance to our restoring his brother, if it
				be God's will that we <pb n="230"/> should have the power. Tell me, Edward, how did
				you get on at school to-day?" </p>
			<p>"Every body was kind to me," answered the boy.</p>
			<p>"That's well, dear boy, and every body will be kind to you. He looks nicely in his
				new clothes, does he not, Mrs. Armstrong?"</p>
			<p>"He does indeed, ma'am! and I could almost fancy that he looked better in health
				already, for having left the mill," replied the widow.</p>
			<p>"And I feel better," said Edward, looking at his mother with his soft thoughtful
				eyes, "and I don't think that it would be impossible for me to grow well again."</p>
			<p>"My boy! my boy!" cried the poor cripple, raising herself in her bed, and throwing
				her arms around him. "Should I dare to complain of any thing if that were possible!
				But oh! Teddy! wouldn't he have given one of his little hands to see it?"</p>
			<p>This appeal, which in truth only echoed the thoughts of his own heart, overthrew all
				the courage of Edward, and his tears again flowed as fast as those of his poor
				mother; a renewal of weakness of which they might both have been still more ashamed
				than they were, had they not perceived that neither Miss Brotherton nor her old
				friend had dry eyes.</p>
			<p>Mary, however, was too wise to let this last.</p>
			<p>"This dear boy," said she, "has said that which ought to give us all courage. I can
				hardly tell you the delightful feeling which the hope of his restoration to health
				would give me. It would repay me a thousand fold for all the pain I have suffered.
				Let us fix our thoughts on this hope, and trust me it shall be realized, if medical
				skill and kind treatment can do it."</p>
			<p>It was with this assurance she left them, and if any earthly promise could have
				healed the anguish of the mother's heart, it would have been this. But her two
				children were so twined and twisted together in her thoughts, that meditating upon
				her hopes for Edward inevitably brought her terrors for Michael before her, and it
				was but with a fitful sort of satisfaction that the boy dwelt upon his anticipations
				of being useful to her, or that she listened to him.</p>
			<p>Two days after this, while Miss Brotherton and Mrs. Tremlett were pursuing their
				usual morning occupations in the boudoir, a servant announced that a lady and
				gentleman were in the drawing-room.</p>
			<p>Had the announcement been of a gentleman alone, Mary's thoughts would have instantly
				suggested Mr. Bell, for they had been fixed upon him, and the hope of his coming,
				through both the preceding days. But the mention of the lady puzzled her.
				Nevertheless the gentleman was Mr. Bell, and no other, and the frank and simple
				kindness with which he said, as he led the lady forward to meet her, "Miss
				Brotherton! I wanted my wife to know you too," rendered the introduction as
				agreeable as it was unexpected.</p>
			<p> "If you and I, my dear young lady," said he, "take to consulting together concerning
				what we may hope, and what we may do in aid of the suffering people by whom we are
				surrounded, we shall do well to <pb n="231"/> take this good little woman into the
				committee, for she has probably more practical knowledge of the subject we were
				discussing when last we met, than any other lady you could meet with." </p>
			<p>Equally cordial and sincere was the welcome Mary gave to her new friends; and if
				sympathy of feeling, and a community of interest, on a subject of deep importance to
				them all, could have sufficed to make them happy, the long morning they passed
				together would have been one of great enjoyment; but they were all too much in
				earnest to be called happy while dwelling upon the frightful subject to which their
				thoughts were turned. The longer Mary listened to those whose lives were past in
				struggling to assuage the misery around them, and in battling with the horrid
				principles which produced it, the more deeply did she feel that she, too, was called
				upon to labour in the same thorny vineyard. Yet terrible as were the subjects they
				discussed, and sad as was the conviction that no power less mighty than that of the
				law could redress the evils they deplored, there was still something inexpressibly
				soothing to her feelings, in finding herself thus in intimate relation with persons
				who comprehended and shared in the sentiments which had become so essentially a part
				of herself. Though her conscience had told her, from the first moment her attention
				had been called to the subject, that it was her duty not to turn away from it, she
				had hitherto met little but opposition from those around her, and though steadfast
				and firm in purpose, she had often felt heavy in spirit from knowing herself to be
				alone, when she so much wanted assistance and support. This oppressive loneliness
				she could never suffer from again, as long as Mr. Bell and his excellent wife were
				within her reach, and fervently did she bless the courage which had led her to their
				dwelling. Tidings of poor Michael, however, there were none. Mr. Bell had sought
				information concerning him wherever he thought it possible to obtain them, but he
				had learnt nothing. Nevertheless he declared himself by no means satisfied that the
				boy might not be at some one of the Bastille-like establishments to which he had
				applied. "I know them, and they know me too well," he said, "for me to place
				implicit confidence in any answer they may be pleased to make, to any question I may
				venture to ask. If I knew where to find a trust-worthy stranger, who could not by
				possibility be recognised by any one as a friend of mine, I still think the chances
				would be greatly in favour of our finding the boy at some of the noted apprenticing
				establishments which I have named. But, in truth, I know not where to look for such
				a person."</p>
			<p>"Am I not such a one?" cried Mary, eagerly. "Hardly a creature in the world, beyond
				the town of Ashleigh and its neighbourhood, knows me personally, and in all such
				places as those you have named, the Emperor of all the Russias would not be less
				likely to be recognised."</p>
			<p>"But how, my dear young lady, could you represent yourself with any face of
				probability as interested in the inquiries you would have to make?" demanded Mr.
				Bell.</p>
			<p> "Methinks, Mr. Bell," replied Mary, colouring with her own enthusiasm, <pb n="232"/>
				— "methinks I could carry through an enterprise which had the recovery of little
				Michael for its object, with a degree of diplomatic skill that would surprise you.
				It should not be by downright and direct inquiry that I should proceed. Where such
				inquiry would be likely to excite suspicion, I would only contrive to insinuate
				myself and my eyes, and would ask no questions save what they should answer." </p>
			<p>"Many strangers, travelling, desire to see the factories, certainly," replied Mr.
				Bell, musingly. "But you are so young to undertake a wandering expedition. And then,
				how could you be accompanied? Your servants would unquestionably announce you every
				where."</p>
			<p>"I am older, I think, than you suppose," replied Mary; "and if I undertake this, I
				will be accompanied by Mrs. Tremlett, with whom I have no reserves, and by no one
				else."</p>
			<p>"You cannot travel without attendants, Miss Brotherton?" said the clergyman, looking
				at her kindly, but as if doubting that she was quite in earnest.</p>
			<p>"Do not either of you judge me harshly," replied the heiress, with great earnestness;
				"do not set me down in your judgments as a hot-headed girl, indifferent to the
				opinions of society, and anxious only to follow the whim of the moment. Did I belong
				to any one, I think I should willingly yield to their guidance. But I am alone in
				the world; I have no responsibilities but to God and my own conscience, and the only
				way I know of, by which I can make this desolate sort of freedom endurable, is by
				fearlessly, and without respect to any prejudices or opinions whatever, employing my
				preposterous wealth in assisting the miserable race from whose labours it has been
				extracted. If you can aid me in doing this, you will do me good; but you will do me
				none, Mr. Bell, by pointing out to me the etiquettes by which the movements of other
				young ladies are regulated. I cannot think that I have any right to a place among
				them; and I therefore feel that to check any possible usefulness by a constant
				reference to the usages of persons with whom I have little or nothing in common,
				would be putting on very heavy harness, neither effective for use, nor for ornament.
				But 'something too much of this.' I must not talk of myself," she added, cheerfully.
				"Let us examine the possibility of my setting off with Mrs. Tremlett on a little
				home tour, without announcing the important event to the neighbourhood, or taking
				any servants with me to enact the part of Fame behind my chariot."</p>
			<p>"By what conveyance would you propose to travel, Miss Brotherton?" inquired Mr. Bell,
				still looking, as an American would say, "as if he could not realize the
				scheme."</p>
			<p> Mary meditated for a moment, and then replied — "In the first instance, if you and
				Mrs. Bell will permit it, we shall go to your house in the same manner as before,
				only carrying with us a small travelling-trunk or so, such as would be necessary if
				we were going to pass a week with you. On the following morning we would set off by
				the — coach, in which you will secure places for us. At — we will order dinner and
				beds, like any other travellers, and inquire of <pb n="233"/> the waiter what will
				be the best way of getting a sight of the factories." </p>
			<p>"And he will tell you that such and such factories — naming precisely those in which
				there would not be the slightest chance of finding the boy — may be seen by
				application made to Mr. So-and-so," said Mr. Bell.</p>
			<p>Mary coloured, and seemed about to answer him; but, either from consciousness that
				she had nothing very satisfactory to reply, or because she had some notion in her
				head not sufficiently digested to communicate, she changed her purpose, and instead
				of combating an objection which seemed almost fatal, drew from her pocket a set of
				little ivory tablets, on which she had written the names of all the establishments
				within a distance of twenty miles, notorious for taking apprentices, and of
				retaining them by means that converted the scene of their labour into a most strict
				and wretched prison-house. She read their names aloud. "These, I think, were all you
				mentioned to me?" said she. "I think they were," replied Mr. Bell. "But to these,
				believe me, you will get no admission as a visiter."</p>
			<p>"Will <hi>you</hi> admit me as a visiter, if I come to you the day after tomorrow,
				Mrs. Bell?" said the heiress, playfully, and apparently wishing to wave any further
				discussion of her projects.</p>
			<p>"Most joyfully!" was the kind and hospitable reply.</p>
			<p>"Then, for the rest we must trust to chance. And now, if you will let me, I will show
				you my pretty garden," said Miss Brotherton, rising, and taking from a chair by the
				open window the ever-ready shawl and parasol, which made her lawns and shrubberies
				essentially a part of her dwelling-place. "Of all the fine things I possess, I
				believe I am only truly thankful for this," she continued, "I hardly know how I
				should pass my life if I had not a garden."</p>
			<p>The garden was indeed one that spoke of its owner's love, by a multitude of enjoyable
				nooks that seemed all courting her approach, and by that perfection of elegant
				neatness which is never found in an equal degree where the mistress is indifferent
				respecting it. To her new friends' praises of all this she listened with pleasure,
				and sketched many pleasant plans for future meetings, when they should not, as they
				declared unavoidable now, remain only while their horse was resting. But Mary said
				not a word more on the subject of her purposed expedition till the very moment of
				their departure, and then it was only to remind them that they would see her come
				with her friend to claim their promised hospitality on the next day but one. This
				was received with renewed promises of a joyful welcome, and so they parted.</p>
			<p>The next day was a busy one for Mary. In the first place she was closeted for at
				least two hours after breakfast with Mrs. Tremlett, and, whatever might be the
				subject of their conversation, it appeared to end satisfactorily, for when it was
				over Mary embraced her old friend very cordially, saying, "I feel more grateful,
				much more grateful, than I have words to express, nurse Tremlett, and never shall I
				forget your kindness to me!"</p>
			<p> After this they drove to the entrance of Hoxley-lane, and walked <pb n="234"/>
				thence to pay a farewell visit to Mrs. Armstrong; and here it was evident that,
				however wild the projects might be which the heiress had conceived, she knew how to
				be discreetly silent concerning them, for after bestowing upon the widow a gratuity
				sufficient to supply all her wants for a longer time than she purposed to be absent,
				she took leave of her, saying, "You will not see me again Mrs. Armstrong for a week
				or more, I am engaged to go from home for that time; but I shall take care that
				Edward shall receive as much attention at the school as if I were at home. Be sure
				also, that my absence will not make me the less mindful of Michael. Neither at home
				or abroad shall I cease to employ every means in my power to obtain intelligence
				concerning him." </p>
			<p>To Edward, whom she visited at the school, she gave the same assurance, adding an
				earnest injunction that he should keep in mind the necessity of exerting himself,
				both for the industrious prosecution of his studies, and the not less important
				regulation of his mind on the subject of his brother's absence, the welfare of his
				mother greatly depending upon both. Weakness of every kind seemed to vanish before
				the powerful stimulant thus offered, and she left her little protégé comforted and
				invigorated by the belief that he had a great duty to perform, and that his mother
				was the object of it.</p>
			<p>The preparations for her own and her friends' convenience during the journey were
				very simple, but they puzzled her maid considerably. First, it was so very odd that
				she should be going out upon a visit and take absolutely no dinner dresses at all
				with her; and secondly, it was, if possible, odder still, that she should not take
				her. But Mary listened to all the hints and innuendoes to which these feelings gave
				rise with a sort of gentle indifference, which was doubtless very provoking, till at
				length she was induced to damp the curiosity, which she feared might prove
				inconveniently active during her absence, by saying, "I am going to visit the family
				of a clergyman, Morgan, and, as much dress will not be necessary, I shall not want
				you."</p>
			<p>This was perfectly satisfactory. "A clergyman's family, where much dress would not be
				necessary, was where the lady's maid never did nor never could want to go."</p>
			<p>Nothing could have been more judicious than these explanatory words. They accorded
				perfectly with the report of the servants who attended the carriage, and so
				completely satisfied the household, that, though it was the first absence of so long
				duration that she had made from her home since she became mistress of it, it
				fortunately led to no gossipings whatever.</p>
			<p>We must not pause to describe the pleasant sociable evening passed by our travellers
				at the house of Mr. Bell, nor even relate all that was said in the course of it,
				concerning the expedition they were about to undertake. Every instruction, every
				hint which Mr. Bell believed might be useful, he gave clearly and succinctly, and
				not a word of it was lost upon Mary.</p>

			<p>MISS BROTHERTON SETS OFF ON HER TRAVELS, AND FEELS FRIGHTENED AT HER OWN TEMERITY —

				FACTORIES, AND IS INTRODUCED TO A SUNDAY-SCHOOL — SHE APPROACHES THE PRECINCTS OF

			<p>
				It was about nine o'clock on a bright autumn morning that Miss
				Brotherton and her faithful nurse mounted into a lumbering six-inside vehicle, bound
				for — . Their two small trunks, with " <hi>Mrs. Tremlett, passenger</hi> ," modestly
				written on both, were safely lodged on the top; Mr. Bell gave them a silent blessing
				and a silent nod; the horseboy vociferated "all right," and the richest young lady
				in Lancashirc rolled off, very literally in search of adventures.</p>
			<p>The novelty of her situation, and of her sensations of every kind, the unceremonious
				examination bestowed upon her by a smart young clerk who sat opposite, the anxious
				look of Mrs. Tremlett's usually tranquil face, and the consciousness that the
				enterprise she was upon must even by herself be characterized as wildly extravagant,
				if not carried through with much steady courage and discretion, altogether produced
				a feeling of oppression on her heart that very nearly overcame her. "Am I acting
				rightly in thus exposing myself?" was the question that her startled nerves
				suggested: and had her conscience been unable to answer it boldly and promptly, her
				condition would have been really pitiable. Happily, however, this was not the case.
				There was some feminine timidity about Mary Brotherton, but not an atom of false
				shame or affectation of any kind. "Yes! — I am right!" was the answer recorded on
				her heart of hearts, "and shame to me if I shrink at the first step, for no better
				reason than because the dust flies, and a vulgar young man stares me in the
				face."</p>
			<p>From that moment Mary recoiled no more; and a little resolute meditation on her
				object, and of the strength demanded to obtain it, so effectually restored her usual
				self-possession, that she looked round upon her fellow-travellers with as little
				embarrassment as if she had been used to travel in public all her life, nodded to
				Mrs. Tremlett with an encouraging smile, and thought how very silly people were who
				fancied that every thing unusual must of necessity be terrible.</p>
			<p>"Are you going all the way to — , miss?" said a goodnatured-looking woman who sat
					<hi>bodkin</hi> between the smart clerk and Mrs. Tremlett.</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am, I am," replied Mary, civilly.</p>
			<p>The good-natured woman twisted herself round to reconnoitre Mrs. Tremlett.</p>
			<p>"Your mamma, I suppose, my dear?"</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am — the lady is a friend!"</p>
			<pb n="236"/>
			<p>"Oh! I ask your pardon; you are so very much alike made me say it."</p>
			<p>Mary bowed — Mrs. Tremlett smiled.</p>
			<p>The goodnatured-looking woman persevered in the same train of pertinent observation,
				sometimes addressed to one passenger, and sometimes to another, so as to prevent the
				party from sinking into total silence, which might otherwise, perhaps, have
				happened. But Mary bore her share in this trifling annoyance with perfect
				good-humour; and when at length they arrived at — , and Mrs. Tremlett asked her in
				rather piteous accents, the moment they were alone together, whether she did not
				feel dreadfully worn out, she cheerfully replied,</p>
			<p>"Not the least in the world, my dear friend."</p>
			<p>"Thank God!" replied the old woman, fervently, "I know you do so hate to be bothered,
				Mary, that I was afraid that old fool would put you out of all patience."</p>
			<p>"Times are altered with me now, nurse Tremlett," replied Mary; "I have left off
				living for myself, and I feel my temper improving already by it. Now, then, ring the
				bell, and give your orders; remember, nurse, you are the great lady, and must order
				every thing."</p>
			<p>Encouraged by this cheerful submission to circumstances, which was in truth somewhat
				more than she expected, Mrs. Tremlett began to think that Mary might indeed prove
				capable of carrying through the scheme, the first sketch of which had appeared so
				wild, that nothing short of a devotion to her will, which knew no bounds, could have
				surmounted her averseness to it.</p>
			<p>"My darling child!" cried the old woman, looking at her with equal admiration and
				delight, "your mind is as strong as your heart is tender, and never will I again
				oppose my silly ignorance to any thing you wish to do."</p>
			<p> It was not difficult in this first stage of their expedition to follow exactly the
				plan that had been laid down. The two ladies professed themselves to be travellers,
				anxious to see all objects of curiosity, and particularly the factories, which were,
				as they observed, so famous throughout all the world. The master of the hotel where
				they lodged exerted himself with utmost civility to gratify so natural a desire, and
				Mrs. Tremlett and Mary were accordingly promenaded, on the following morning,
				through one of the largest establishments of the town. It is probable, from the
				drowsiness of the public mind on the subject, that many travelling strangers who are
				in like manner led by a skilful official through the various floors of a factory,
				retire from the spectacle they present without having any feeling of sympathy
				excited by the cursory glance they have thrown over the silent unobtrusive little
				beings, one moment of whose unchanging existence they have been permitted to
				witness. It is the vast, the beautiful, the elaborate machinery by which they were
				surrounded that called forth all their attention, and all their wonder. The uniform
				ceaseless movement, sublime in its sturdy strength and unrelenting activity, drew
				every eye, and rapt the observer's mind in boundless admiration of the marvellous
				power of science! No wonder that along every line a score of <pb n="237"/> noiseless
				children toiled, unthought of, after the admirable machine. Strangers do not visit
				factories to look at them; it is the triumphant perfection of British mechanism
				which they come to see, it is of that they speak, of that they think, of that they
				boast when they leave the life-consuming process behind them. The more delicate, and
				(alas!) living springs by which the Great Artificer has given
				movement to the beings made in his own image, are not worth a thought the while. The
				scientific speculator sees nothing to excite his intellectual acumen in them; he
				hardly knows that they are there, but gazes with enthusiasm and almost reverence on
				the myriads of whirling spindles amidst which they breathe their groans, unheeded,
				and unheard. </p>
			<p>But it was not thus that Mary won her way through the whirling hissing world of
				machinery into which she now entered for the first time in her life. The hot and
				tainted atmosphere seemed to weigh upon her spirits, as well as upon her lungs, and
				the weary aspect of the Drakes, and the failing joints of Edward Armstrong became
				fearfully intelligible as she watched the children (and she watched nothing else)
				who dragged their attenuated limbs along. Then it was that Mr. Bell's tremendous
				statement of the number of suffering beings thus employed came with full force upon
				her mind. She would have given years of existence at that moment, could she have
				believed it false. Two hundred thousand little creatures, created by the abounding
				mercy of God, with faculties for enjoyment so perfect, that no poverty short of
				actual starvation can check their joy so long as innocence and liberty be left them!
				Two hundred thousand little creatures, for whose freedom from toil during their
				tender years the awful voice of nature has gone forth, to be snatched away, living
				and feeling, from the pure air of heaven, while the beautiful process is going on by
				which their delicate fabric gradually strengthens into maturity, — taken for ever
				from all with which their Maker has surrounded them for the purpose of completing
				his own noblest work — taken and lodged amidst stench and stunning, terrifying
				tumult, — driven to and fro, till their little limbs bend under them — hour after
				hour, day after day — the repose of a moment to be purchased only by yielding their
				tender bodies to the fist, the heel, or the strap of the overlooker! All this rushed
				together upon poor Mary's heart and soul, and, turning deadly pale, she seized the
				arm of her friend to save herself from falling.</p>
			<p>"Terrible hot day!" roared their conductor, in the hideous scream by which some human
				voices can battle successfully with the din of machinery.</p>
			<p> Fortunately, they were near the door of the room, and Mrs. Tremlett, urging her
				steps forward, now brought her to an open window outside it. The fresh air, so
				carefully excluded within, <ref target="#ENG18400N4">[4]</ref> soon revived her: the colour returned to her lips, and having
				remained silently inhaling <pb n="238"/> the breeze for another minute or two, she
				signified her wish to proceed. </p>
			<p>"Not now, Mary! Pray, not now!" said the frightened Mrs. Tremlett. "Indeed, indeed,
				you have not strength for it!"</p>
			<p>Mary gave her one steady look, and the opposition ceased; for it said as plainly as
				look could speak — "Is it thus that I shall find Michael Armstrong?"</p>
			<p>"For a moment I felt the heat oppressive," said Miss Brotherton, in a voice of very
				steady composure. "But I am quite sure the sensation will not return. I came to — on
				purpose to see the factories, my dear friend, and, indeed, you must not disappoint
				me."</p>
			<p>"The young lady's right," replied their conductor. "She'll never see the like of our
				mills, you may depend upon that. Why all the machinery in the known world put all
				together won't equal one of our spinning-mills. There is nothing in creation to
				compare to it; and I don't question but the young lady heard as much before she
				come. So it would be altogether wrong to disappoint her of the sight of 'em."</p>
			<p>"Thank you," said Mary. "Are we to go up stairs now?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, if you please, miss. We have got seven stories, here, and, thank God, all is
				busy just now, one as the other, from the bottom to the top."</p>
			<p>On entering the second room Mary felt, as she expected, that her bodily strength was
				quite sufficient to sustain her. She had not habituated herself to "seek the sun
				upon the upland lawn," for nothing. Few girls so lapped in luxury could boast of
				equal vigour and activity. The first aspect of the system (the horrors of which had
				been so clearly explained to her) in action, was for a moment overwhelming — but it
				was past — the terrible " <hi>premier pas</hi> " could not come again, and far from
				shrinking from the task she had imposed upon herself, she left the enormous fabric,
				after having perseveringly mounted to its summit, with the satisfactory conviction
				that she should not fail in her enterprise either from want of strength, or from
				want of will.</p>
			<p>Good Mrs. Tremlett, however, still felt less confident upon the subject, and no
				sooner found herself tête-à-tête with her young mistress within the shelter of their
				drawing-room, than she said, "You will never stand it, Miss Mary! — feeling about it
				all as you do — the sight of those poor ragged, sickly little souls will be the
				death of you."</p>
			<p> "Then so let me die, dear nurse!" replied Mary. "If I have not vigour enough both of
				mind and body to be in some degree useful, I should hardly think it worth while to
				live; but I know myself better, nurse Tremlett. I turned sick and giddy, I confess,
				on entering that first room, but it is my friend, Mr. Bell, who has to answer for
				it. The impressions received at that moment by my senses served as a specimen of all
				the horrors he had described to me. The account I had heard enabled me at a glance
				to comprehend the scene before me, while that scene itself acted back again, as it
				were, upon my memory, making me understand, a thousand times more clearly than
				before, all the frightful details he had given me. The effect of this was
				overpowering, but it <pb n="239"/> cannot return upon me again in the same manner; I
				am already hardened. Think therefore no more of me, dear friend, but let us cogitate
				together upon the likeliest way of turning all such visits to account." </p>
			<p>This cogitation led them both to the conclusion that it might, for the sake of
				appearances, be as well to take the landlord's recommendation to another of the
				establishments, usually pointed out to the attention of strangers, and then to
				consult the ivory tablets, and venture upon a visit to the only one near — named
				therein, as notorious for the reception of apprentices.</p>
			<p>In pursuance of this plan, the waiter was again interrogated when he attended the
				ladies at their luncheon, and again he brought a written address from his master,
				accompanied by a message intimating that the following morning being Sunday, the
				ladies might have the advantage of visiting the Sunday-school attached to the
				factory, for which he had given the address, to a sight of which they would be
				admitted without difficulty, if they would make known their wishes for such
				admission to the person who would show them the factory.</p>
			<p>"There is a Sunday-school attached to the establishment?" said Mary in an accent of
				great satisfaction. "Yes, miss," replied the man, "Messrs. Robert and Joseph
				Tomlins, the serious gentlemen as owns the factory, has built a school-room
				altogether at their own expense, and attends their ownselves in person every Sunday
				morning to see that both master and children puts the time to profit. Their factory
				is about a mile or so out of the town, but master says as he can let you have a
				carriage very reasonable."</p>
			<p>"I should wish to go there by all means," replied Mary, "desire the carriage may be
				got ready for us directly."</p>
			<p>The man left the room to obey her.</p>
			<p>"Thank Heaven!" exclaimed Mary, as the door closed behind him, "there is, then, some
				Christian feeling still left among them here, as well as at Bradford. We shall not
				here, at least, be shocked by witnessing such degrading ignorance as that of the
				poor Drakes. — They are treated like Christian children, at any rate."</p>
			<p>"Most surely it is a pleasure to hear of it, my dear," replied Mrs. Tremlett, "and it
				is quite as well, Mary, that we have got to ride to it — at least if you feel like
				me, my dear."</p>
			<p>Less than half an hour's drive brought the travellers to a large factory, which,
				whatever it might be within, was on the outside, though in itself as grim as
				coal-smoke could make it, surrounded by a fine expanse of rural scenery. In answer
				to their application at the gates they were civilly desired to walk in, and
				presently found that the routine of exhibition was precisely similar to that of the
				morning. It struck them both, however, that if possible, the children looked more
				worn and weary, more miserably lean, and more frightfully pallid, than those they
				had seen before; nevertheless Mary failed not, when taking leave of their conductor,
				to request permission to attend the Sunday-school on the morrow.</p>
			<p> "Certainly!" was the reply, pronounced in a tone as clearly announcing <pb n="240"/>
				the speaker's connexion with the party self-styled evangelical, as the broadest
				Irish brogue does the birthright of the speaker to call himself a son of the Emerald
				Isle. "Certainly! the Lord forbid that Christian women should ask to be present at
				the doings of the godly and be refused!" </p>
			<p>On inquiring the hour at which they should be there, the man replied, "As the clock
				in the tower of the Lord's house strikes seven, Mr. Joseph Tomlins, by the blessing
				of God, will begin to speak the exhortation. The prayer will follow from the lips of
				Mr. Robert, and then the schooling will begin."</p>
			<p>"We must be here, then, exactly at seven?" said Mary. "Ten minutes earlier, would be
				more decent time," replied the man, with a gravity of aspect that approached a
				frown, "our gentlemen are very strict as to their hours in all things."</p>
			<p>They civilly promised to be very punctual, and departed. The factory was built on the
				side of a hill, so steep, that the back part of it, to which the shed used as a
				school-room was attached, could not be safely approached by a carriage; Miss
				Brotherton, therefore, and her old friend, on arriving at the bottom of the hill on
				the following morning, got out, and, desiring the vehicle to await their return,
				proceeded on foot by the path pointed out to them as "the way to Master Tomlin's
				school." The ladies were more than punctual, for it still wanted a quarter to seven,
				they therefore seated themselves on a fallen tree by the road-side, and watched the
				arrival of one or two miserable-looking children who were laggingly approaching the
				spot.</p>
			<p>"You look half asleep my poor child!" said Mary, laying her hand on the shoulder of a
				little girl, who ragged, pale, half-washed, and with eyes half-closed, was being
				dragged onward by an older child, a boy, apparently about ten years old.</p>
			<p>"She be so hard asleep by times," said the boy, "that I can't get her on."</p>
			<p>"But why is that, my dear? surely seven o'clock is not so very early!" said Mary.</p>
			<p>"We were all to the mill till five minutes afore twelve," said the boy, making
				another effort to pull his sister onward.</p>
			<p>"How! — do you mean to tell me that you were working at midnight?" demanded Mary.</p>
			<p>"Five minutes afore twelve we stopped — 'cause it was Sunday," replied the boy. "Come
				along Peggy!" he added with another stout tug, "I shall catch it to-morrow from the
				looker if I'se too late for the 'sortation."</p>
			<p>The little girl who had fallen fairly asleep, during this short delay, being thus
				roused again, stumbled onwards, leaving Mrs. Tremlett and Mary alike undeceived as
				to the humanity of instituting a school to be carried on under such regulations.
				They determined, however, to witness with their own eyes the operation of teaching
				children to read, who were fast asleep, and walking on came within sight of the
				school-room door just as Mr. Joseph Tomlins showed himself on the step before it,
				with his watch in one hand and a bible in the other.</p>
			<p> "Wicked and ungrateful children!" he began, "Is this the way <pb n="241"/> you obey
				your earthly master, who leaves his comfortable bed, and his breakfast untouched, to
				lead you to the feet of your heavenly one! Wicked, idle, and ungrateful — " But at
				this moment Miss Brotherton and Mrs. Tremlett appeared in sight, and in a voice
				suddenly changed from reprobation into drawling softness, he went on, "Come unto Him
				little children — I forbid you not, but urge you with tender Christian love, early
				and late, late and early, to hear His word, and sing His praise." </p>
			<p>Here he stopped, and bowing to the ladies offered to lead them to a place where they
				might be well accommodated for the exhortation and and prayer, and for hearing the
				children also, if they wished it.</p>
			<p>As soon as they had entered the sort of pew to which Mr. Tomlins led them, the twenty
				or thirty miserable-looking children who were assembled in the room were called upon
				by a loud word of command to " Kneel !" and down they tumbled, the
				elder ones in several instances taking the little creatures already asleep beside
				them, and placing them on the floor as nearly as they could in the attitude
				commanded. The sonorous voice of Mr. Joseph Tomlins was then heard pronouncing an
				exhortation, intended to show that obedience to their earthly masters was the only
				way of saving children from the eternal burning, prepared for those who were
				disobedient, in the world to come.</p>
			<p>Mary, as she looked earnestly round upon every child present, greatly doubted if
				there was one sufficiently awake to listen to this; and in her heart she blessed the
				heaviness which saved them from hearing the mercy of their Maker blasphemed. A
				prayer followed this exhortation, as little like what a prayer ought to be, as was
				the preparation of the little congregation who listened to it for bearing part in a
				religious ceremony. Still Mary Brotherton waited to the end, nor left her station
				till the nominal business of instruction had proceeded sufficiently to convince her
				that poor Sophy Drake's account was strictly true when she said "keeping our eyes
				open Sundays wasn't possible, 'cause they didn't strap us." The children were
					<hi>not</hi> strapped, and consequently they were, with very few exceptions,
				literally fast asleep during the hour and half that this ostentatious form of
				instruction was going on.</p>
			<p>Unwilling to attract more notice than was necessary, Miss Brotherton and her
				companion remained till the drowsy tribe were roused, awakened, and dismissed by the
				loud voice of Mr. Joseph Tomlins, and then they also slipped away, regained the
				carriage that waited for them, and returned to — .</p>
			<p>"Now then," said Mary, as their one horse dragged them deliberately along, "now then,
				dear Tremlett, our search must really begin. As soon as we have breakfasted we will
				set off in this same equipage for — Mill, that being the first on my list where
				apprentices are taken, and, moreover, within a morning's drive of — ."</p>
			<p>"And how shall you endeavour to gain admittance my dear?" demanded her friend.</p>
			<p>"As we did yesterday — merely stating that we are strangers, travelling, who are
				desirous of seeing the factories," replied Mary.</p>
			<pb n="242"/>
			<p>"But you don't expect to get in, my dear, do you? — after all Mr. Bell told you about
				apprentices!" exclaimed Mrs. Tremlett.</p>
			<p>"Probably not," was the answer, "and in that case, my dear woman, you know what is to
				happen."</p>
			<p>"You are really in earnest then, Miss Mary?" rejoined her friend in an accent which
				betrayed some nervousness. "You really mean to do all you said when we were shut up
				together?"</p>
			<p>"Most certainly I do," replied Miss Brotherton, gravely. "Did you suppose I was
				jesting, nurse Tremlett, in what I then said to you?"</p>
			<p>"Not jesting, Miss Mary. — No, certainly, not jesting. Only I thought that may be
				after a little more thinking about it you might change your mind."</p>
			<p>"You do not yet understand me, nurse!" said Mary, with vexation. "You do not yet
				comprehend how determined I am to persevere in the business I have undertaken."</p>
			<p>"Do not say so, dearest Miss Mary!" replied the old woman with emotion, "I do
				understand you, — I do know that you will leave no stone unturned to obtain your
				object, — and indeed, indeed, I love you a thousand times better than ever I did,
				and that is just because I do understand you; only I did not feel quite sure that
				you would have courage."</p>
			<p>"We shall see, nurse Tremlett. Courage, I believe, often depends more upon the
				earnestness of the will than the strength of the nerves," said Mary.</p>
			<p>Their attempt to get admittance to the apprentice factory was, as they both expected,
				abortive; they were told that no persons were admitted there except on business, and
				having nothing such to plead, they retreated as they had advanced, somewhat fearful
				lest their having taken so much trouble for nothing, might excite the alarming
				observation. "It is very odd," on the part of their driver or some of his
				gossips.</p>
			<p>The distance was considerably greater than they had expected, and they had little
				more time on their return to — , than sufficed for securing places in a
				cross-country coach for the morrow, which would convey them to a small town named by
				Mr. Bell, within a morning's drive of which were two establishments known to receive
				apprentices, howsoever and wheresoever they could get them.</p>
			<p>Having again booked their places in the name of Tremlett, prepared their travelling
				luggage for a further progress, and taken a meal that served for dinner and tea in
				one, they went to rest. But it was long ere the excited mind of Mary permitted her
				to sleep; nor did she, in fact, close her eyes till, after repeated consideration,
				she had decided totally to change the plan of operations she had fixed upon for the
				morrow.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett had not yet left her bed, when her young mistress appeared at the foot
				of it, on the following morning, with her ivory tablets in her hand. "Nurse
				Tremlett," she said, "do you remember which, among all the places mentioned here,
				was the one Mr. Bell declared that he considered as the <hi>most</hi> likely for Sir
				Matthew to have selected, if his purpose was to keep the abode of Michael Armstrong
				unknown?"</p>
			<pb n="243"/>
			<p>"Dear me! My dear Miss Mary! Only think of your being up already and me lying abed
				so!" was the reply she received.</p>
			<p>"Never mind that, dear nurse. It is not getting-up time yet — only I am restless. Do
				you remember the name of the mills Mr. Bell particularly dwelt upon?"</p>
			<p>"I dare say I might, Miss Mary, if I was to hear it spoken again," said the old
				woman, sitting up in bed, and endeavouring to feel awake.</p>
			<p>"Now then listen, dear soul, and stop me when you think I name the right." Mary then
				turned to her tablets, and read the names, with the descriptions of the localities
				inscribed there. It was not till she had reached the last in the list that Mrs.
				Tremlett again spoke, and then she exclaimed promptly, "That is it, Mary! I am quite
				sure that is the place! 'I will bet ten to one,' he said, 'that if Sir Matthew has
				been for putting the boy out of sight, Deep Valley Mill is where he will have lodged
				him.' Those were his words, Miss Mary — I could quite swear it."</p>
			<p>"I was pretty sure of it before, nurse Tremlett, but now no doubt can possibly
				remain. Hear me, then, my dear kind friend, and tell me truly if I am right or
				wrong. I settled last night, nurse, to set off and visit all these factories exactly
				in the order in which they are here set down. But, after I went to bed, it struck me
				that it would be surely better to begin with the place pointed out by our good
				friend as the most likely to afford success. I like the business quite as little as
				you do, nurse, and would gladly shorten it, if possible."</p>
			<p>"But, my dear, won't the stage we are going in take us the wrong way?"</p>
			<p>"A little round about — but I see no objection in that; we have no particular wish,
				you know, to have our course traced, and this setting off in one direction, when our
				purpose is to take another, must go far towards preventing it. So that you see we
				have no immediate change to make, and you have only to get up, and eat your
				breakfast in time to be ready for the coach, that is to stop for us here."</p>
			<p>"God bless your dear heart!" said the old woman. "You think ten times more of me than
				you do of yourself, darling! Little sleep last night, Mary, and getting up before
				any body else in the morning, is not the way to be quite strong and composed
				by-and-by."</p>
			<p>"Fear nothing — I feel perfectly well, and greatly pleased by our change of plans. I
				have great faith in this visit to Deep Valley, and long to have the experiment made
				and over."</p>
			<p>Mary Brotherton was quite correct in her geography; the place to which the coach
				conveyed them was at about the same distance from Deep Valley as from — ; and,
				without making any further inquiries concerning that mysterious spot, which indeed
				the memoranda received from Mr. Bell rendered quite unnecessary, she ordered a
				chaise, on quitting the stage-coach, to convey them to the nearest town at which he
				had stated that it would be likely they should find decent accommodation for the
				night.</p>
			<p> Both the young and the old lady were rather surprised, on reaching <pb n="244"/>
				this place, to find every house in it that offered public accommodation so poor and
				miserable looking, as to make them almost afraid to enter. Their driver, however,
				soon drew up to one which, upon Mrs. Tremlett's inquiring if it were the best, he
				assured them, was not only the best, but the only one that ladies could find
				comfortable. "Here then we will get out," said Mary, courageously, and giving her
				friend an encouraging smile, she preceded her into a room that smelt strongly of
				tobacco-smoke, ale, and gin. </p>
			<p>"Can we have an up-stairs room that might be more open and airy like?" said Mrs.
				Tremlett, looking anxiously at her young mistress.</p>
			<p>"To sleep in?" demanded the woman who had received them.</p>
			<p>"A sitting-room, good woman, I mean," responded the meek-spirited Mrs. Tremlett, half
				frightened by the woman's look and accent.</p>
			<p>"What, this is not good enough, I suppose? Then you may trudge — it is good enough
				for your betters," replied the woman, looking most alarmingly sulky. Had the last
				been addressed to herself, Mary Brotherton would have thought it one of the duties
				imposed by her pilgrimage to endure it; but, as it was, she slipped out of the
				dungeon-parlour with great celerity, and reached the house-door before the postboy
				had succeeded in his attempts to untie the cord which fastened their trunks behind
				the chaise. Apparently hands were scarce at this unpromising hostelry, for he was
				performing the business alone, at which Mary greatly rejoiced, as it enabled her to
				address him unobserved. "This does not seem a comfortable house, my lad, that you
				have brought us to. Don't you think we might do better if we tried another?"</p>
			<p>"It be the best in the town," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"Then could you not drive as a mile or two out of it?" said Mary, in a very coaxing
				voice. "We should like to sleep at any little country inn by the roadside a great
				deal better than this."</p>
			<p>"And how would my master's horses like it I wonder?" said the postboy. By this time
				Mary's purse was visible in her hand. The youth's countenance softened as he gazed
				upon it, and he presently gave an unequivocal symptom of relenting, by scratching
				his head. Miss Brotherton held half-a-sovereign between her finger and thumb — "I
				will give you this, she said, beyond the sum you are to receive for the horses if
				you will drive us on to some clean country inn at which we could sleep."</p>
			<p>"Where is the old lady?" demanded the boy in something like a whisper.</p>
			<p>"I will bring her out this moment," said she; and, without waiting further parley,
				Mary flitted back again through the vapour of tobacco and spirits to rescue her old
				friend, — a deed of daring that found its reward in the look of gentle satisfaction
				with which her signal to quit the parlour was obeyed; for Mrs. Tremlett was one who
				could not bandy words, and she had therefore endured, without intermission or
				resistance, as much insolence as could be compressed into the period of her abode in
				the apartment.</p>
			<p>"Why did you not follow me at once, dear nurse?" said Mary, as soon as the postboy
				had closed the carriage-door upon them.</p>

			<p>"Bless you, my dear, I never thought of getting away again till to-morrow morning,
				and I staid with her to prevent her following you. How very glad I am we are got
				away safe and sound from that terrible woman! How could you have the courage and
				cleverness to think of it, Mary? Sure enough, dear, it is you that take care of me —
				and that's a shame, isn't it?"</p>
			<p>"It is but fair, nurse, that we should divide the labours of the road between us. It
				is you who always take care that we are not starved, and it is not too much in
				return that I should be watchful for your preservation from all the wild cats and
				tigresses we may chance to encounter."</p>
			<p>The postboy earned his golden gratuity, greatly to the contentment of its donor, by
				drawing up at a small but perfectly neat little mansion, where milk-pans set on end
				to dry before the door offered a delightful contrast to all that had been visible at
				the sign of the Three Crowns. The clean-coifed landlady looked a little surprised at
				being asked for sleeping-rooms by ladies entitled to so splendid a mode of
				travelling, but the demand being satisfactorily answered, they were quickly
				installed in a parlour smelling of geraniums instead of gin, and giving orders for
				their evening meal to the bustling good woman of the house with an air of old
				acquaintanceship, that looked as if they had been her guests for a month.</p>
			<p>"Nothing was ever so fortunate as this, nurse Tremlett," said Mary, as soon as they
				were left alone; "our stage-playing, as you are pleased to call it, must begin here.
				There is no danger that this kind simple-hearted creature should misdoubt a word we
				say, and if you will only perform your allotted part with your usual quiet good
				sense, I have no doubt but we shall reach her heart sufficiently to make her very
				useful. I do not ask you to say any thing — only look sufficiently interested to
				support the character I assign you."</p>
			<p>"Oh! dear Miss Mary!" exclaimed Mrs. Tremlett, colouring, — "is it to begin
				already?"</p>
			<p>The countenance of Miss Brotherton fell from an expression of great animation into
				that of deep despondency and disappointment, she found that all her difficulties
				with the old woman were about to be renewed. "Oh! why, Mrs. Tremlett, if you are
				unequal to this, did you not honestly tell me so when I explained my purpose to you
				before we set out?" said she, with more of severity than she had ever used in
				addressing her during her whole life before, "I could then have taken measures to
				carry on this business without you. You know how deeply my heart is in it — I did
				not expect this weakness — I thought it was over!"</p>
			<p>"You are wrong, Miss Mary — you are mistaken altogether," replied Mrs. Tremlett,
				eagerly. "I am neither weak nor silly, and so you shall see, if you won't be so very
				rash and hasty with me."</p>
			<p>By no means displeased at the energy with which the good woman defended herself, Mary
				replied, "Let me see this, Tremlett, and my love and value for you will increase a
				hundred fold."</p>
			<p>"Begin, then, as soon as you like, my dear, I am quite ready."</p>
			<pb n="246"/>
			<p>And, in saying this, the good old woman assumed an aspect as full of confidence and
				courage as her own.</p>
			<p>In a few minutes their repast, which a good dairy made luxurious, was before them,
				the landlady remaining in attendance to replenish the tea-pot, and so forth.</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton's manners, though by no means remarkable to those in her own station
				for that perfect polish which guards every thing without, and every thing within,
				from disagreeable impressions, were always conciliatory and kind to all below her,
				and seldom was she waited upon by any one who would not have gladly retained that
				office near her. So it was with Mrs. Prescot of the King's Head; the good woman
				lingered in the room, evidently because she liked being there, and taking advantage
				of this, Mary addressed her, venturing to give her the name she had read upon the
				sign.</p>
			<p>"We are in Derbyshire, are we not, Mrs. Prescot?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, miss; this is Derbyshire, sure enough."</p>
			<p>"What distance is it from hence to Deep Valley?"</p>
			<p>"What, the factory, miss, that is called Deep Valley Mill?"</p>
			<p>"Yes; how far is it to that factory?"</p>
			<p>"Why it is not over easy to say rightly, seeing that there is no direct road to it.
				It is a lonesome out-of-the-way place as ever human beings thought of taking to, and
				I can't say as much is knowed about it by any of the neighbours round. There is a
				cart-road, I believe, as goes right down to the mill, but the nearest way would be
				over them hills there, of course, because the factory is built down amongst the very
				middlemost of 'em," replied Mrs. Prescot.</p>
			<p>"Would the walk over the hills be too far for my aunt and me?" inquired Mary.</p>
			<p>"Oh dear yes, miss! I should think so! Besides, 'tis no place whatever for ladies to
				go to. The poor little creturs as bides there bean't no sight for them to look at;
				and, besides, nobody of any sort is ever let to look at 'em."</p>
			<p>"We must get there, somehow or other, Mrs. Prescot," said Mary; "and I trust in God
				that we shall not be refused admittance, for our business is no common one."</p>
			<p>"You have got business at Deep Valley Mill?" demanded Mrs. Prescot, abruptly.</p>
			<p>"Indeed we have," replied Mary, "and, by some means or other, we must get in, and,
				what is more, we must see every apprentice they have."</p>
			<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
			<p> "I have had more than one lodging here for a night," said she, "who for some reason
				or other was curious to get inside of Deep Valley Mill. But I never knowed one of
				'em that ever did more than get a look down upon it from the top of one of them
				mountainous hills out yonder; and it's no easy matter, they say, to get to the right
				place even for that; for, by what folks say, them as built the mills seem to think
				that they could puzzle the <pb n="247"/> wicked one himself to find 'em out. But
				there's one eye as sees 'em, if no other do." </p>
			<p>These last words were added in a mutter that might, or might not, be noticed,
				according to the pleasure of the parties within hearing. Mary did not notice
				them.</p>
			<p>"Could you have the kindness to tell us to whom we should apply for permission to go
				through the factory?" said she.</p>
			<p>"Indeed, miss, I am happy to say I knows nothing about 'em, and if all's true as I've
				heard said over the ale-pot by the kitchen fire, the more people ask for leave, the
				less they are likely to get it. But may I make so bold, miss, as to ask the reason
				why such ladies as you wants to get in there? It would only break your hearts; and
				what's more, they've been having a horrid fever there, and that I know for certain,
				though they sent the poor little creturs off by night to be buried, some to one
				churchyard, and some to another, to stop people's tongues. It bean't no place,
				ladies, for you to go."</p>
			<p>"When I tell you <hi>why</hi> we wish to enter there you will not say so," replied
				Mary. "The mill is worked by apprentice children, is it not?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, miss, the more's the pity — for that's what makes the poor wretches slaves for
				life — for not many of 'em, by all accounts, lives till their time is up."</p>
			<p>"Hear me then, Mrs. Prescot — among those miserable apprentices we hope and expect to
				find a dear child who belongs to us."</p>
			<p>"Lack-a-day! what a story-book that would make!" exclaimed Mrs. Prescot. "How long is
				it since you lost him?"</p>
			<p>"It is a long time," replied Mary, evading the question, "and it is a long story to
				tell how it happened. He is my own brother — and this lady who is come with me is
				our aunt."</p>
			<p>"Are you quite sure, miss, that you shall find him there?"</p>
			<p>"How can I say that, Mrs. Prescot, when you tell me so many of the children are
				dead?" replied Mary. "But so much do I think I shall, that I will give five
				sovereigns to any one who will only put me in the way to get admittance to the
				mill."</p>
			<p>Mrs. Prescot again shook her head. "There be a many and a many poor souls round about
				that would do amost any thing honest for such a reward; but if any body told you
				they could do as much, they would only deceive you. I don't believe there is any
				body in the parish, not even the parson, could make 'em open their doors to let
				strangers in."</p>
			<p>"Do you think that the person who has the power to open them would do it for a
				hundred pounds?" demanded Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"I can't take upon me to say, miss; it sounds like a fortune to me — but they are all
				rich at Deep Valley, as folks say, managers, overlookers, and all — so, may be they
				mayn't think so much of it."</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Prescot, I would give five hundred pounds, rather than not look over the
				children at Deep Valley Mill."</p>
			<p> The woman stared at her with a very natural mixture of curiosity and astonishment;
				but there was a friendly interest in her eye, also. "It's late to-night, ma'am, to
				do anything," said she, "and if you'll be pleased to say nothing to nobody till my
				husband comes home, I don't know <pb n="248"/> but what he may be as likely to think
				upon what would be the best way to set about it as any body; not that he ever
				meddles or makes with the people of the mill in any way, but he's a good schollard,
				and a quick-witted man too, as ever I knowed, though I say it as shouldn't." </p>
			<p>This proposal was readily agreed to, and the interval till their host's return
				employed in a ramble of a mile or two along the road, where a recent shower had laid
				the dust, while every woodbine in the hedges which skirted it, sent forth a
				delicious perfume. The outline of the hills around them, though hardly deserving
				Mrs. Prescot's epithet of mountainous, was bold and picturesque, and the foreground,
				with its hanging levels and rich copses, altogether formed a scene of considerable
				beauty.</p>
			<p>"All this is very pretty, my good Tremlett," said Mary, offering her arm to her old
				friend to assist her ascent of a steep hill, "and I should enjoy it greatly did I
				not fancy that could we look over yonder hill-tops we should see a hateful roof,
				excluding the sweet breath of evening from the helpless creatures it encloses."</p>
			<p>"God grant that you may snatch one of them from it, my dear child," replied the old
				woman; "let that thought comfort you."</p>
			<p>"Should I succeed!" cried Mary, "should I indeed carry home that little fellow to his
				poor mother and my pretty Edward, I should certainly feel something approaching to
				perfect happiness! But if I fail! how shall I bear to meet them?"</p>
			<p>"Think not of it, dear! see how that last bit of sunshine comes full upon your face
				as you talk about it; that is a sign my dear that you will have your wish."</p>
			<p>It <hi>was</hi> the last bit of sunshine, for the next moment the golden disk was hid
				behind a ridge of hills; yet they walked on for nearly a mile further, and, when
				they returned to the King's Head, they found the good man of the house already
				returned, and his supper, as his wife assured them, very nearly finished. "He shall
				come to you in half a minute, ladies, if you'll please to be seated, while I bring
				in the candles; — I have told him all you said to me, and he don't seem so much put
				out about it, by much, as me, — but he's uncommon 'cute, as you'll find when you
				comes to talk to him."</p>
			<p>In about a quarter of an hour Mr. Prescot knocked at the parlour-door, and being
				properly introduced to the ladies by his wife, was left standing before them, while
				she retreated to pursue her various avocations.</p>
			<p>"Your wife has told you, Mr. Prescot, our reason for coming here?" said Miss
				Brotherton, glad to escape the repetition of her fictitious tale.</p>
			<p>"She has, ma'am," was the succinct reply.</p>
			<p>"And do you think it possible for us to obtain admission to Deep Valley Mill, and to
				go over it in such a manner as to give us an opportunity of seeing all the
				children?"</p>
			<p> "If I had heard that much, as to your purpose, ladies, and nothing more, I should
				have said NO you could no more get into Deep Valley factory than into the moon. But
				my missis added something to the <pb n="249"/> back of it, as makes a difference."
				This was said with a look and accent which fully justified Mrs. Prescot's assurances
				of her good man's "'cuteness." </p>
			<p>"I think, Mr. Prescot, that she said no more than I am willing to make good," replied
				Mary, "I do not wish to expend money wantonly, but, if less will not serve, I am
				ready to give five hundred pounds to any person who could enable me to see all the
				children in Deep Valley Mill."</p>
			<p>"It is a long sum, miss," replied the man thoughtfully, "and I can't but fancy that
				less might serve. The people as is in authority there is bad people, I don't scruple
				to say it, and sooner than open their doors for pity towards any Christian soul,
				man, woman, or child, they would see 'em all in the bottomless pit. But 'tis just
				because they do all the wickedness we hears of, that I sees hope they may be bought
				to break their own laws; for if they does one thing for the love of gold, they may
				do another. 'Tis plain enough to see, to be sure, that they knows it is for their
				interest to keep all eyes off their cruel goings-on — and what's for their interest
				they won't easily give up. — So it may be that squire Elgood Sharpton himself would
				turn away from five hundred pounds, rather than show off his poor miserable
				apprentices. — But that mayn't hold good for his agent, and I believe in my heart
				that, if we could quietly get to offer Woodcomb the manager a hundred pounds, you
				would not have long to wait for a sight of the children."</p>
			<p>"And how is this to be done, Mr. Prescot?" said Miss Brotherton, "if you can
				undertake to manage it, you may put what price you like on your services, I feel
				certain that you would not name a higher sum than I should be willing to pay."</p>
			<p>"Why, as for me, miss, I must not be known to meddle or make in the matter. Squire
				Sharpton would have my licence away before I could say Jack Robinson. Any advice I
				can give is at your service, and I may be able to put you up, perhaps, to doing the
				thing in the likeliest way; but as to my going to the mill, it won't do. One reason
				is, that I never was there before, and it's like enough that, seeing a stranger,
				they'd set the dogs at me before I had time to say my errand. No! — that won't
				answer. The only man I can think of as would give us a chance is one Smith, the
				miller as serves 'em with oatmeal, and pretty stuff 'tis, as I've been told, which
				don't speak over-well for his honesty, you'll say, though 'tis likely the price is
				in proportion. Howsomever, whether he be good or bad, I don't know another as comes
				and goes to Deep Valley as he does, and that's what makes me fix upon him as a
				messenger."</p>
			<p>"And when could I see this man?" demanded Mary.</p>
			<p>"Why, betimes to-morrow, miss, there's no doubt, if I goes and gives him notice."</p>
			<p>"Then, do so Mr. Prescot, and be assured your trouble shall not be forgotten."</p>
			<p> "There is no fear of it, miss," replied the acute landlord with very honest
				sincerity, "and I'll go to the mill outright. But I think — you'll be pleased to
				excuse me for speaking my mind — that you two <pb n="250"/> ladies must settle
				between yourselves what you'd be willing to give Timothy Smith himself for the job —
				seeing that he's not one to work for nothing; — and another thing I'd make so free
				as to mention is, that you'd do well to make him understand that you don't want to
				get inside their wicked den, but only to see the children, one and all of 'em — and
				then you know, miss, they may trim 'em and scour 'em up a little for shame's sake,
				afore they brings 'em out." </p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton, after this conversation, felt as fully convinced as the good wife
				herself could desire of the value of the landlord's head, and determined to be
				guided by his advice. After a little further conversation between them, it was
				settled that she should write a note to Mr. Woodcomb, the manager, in readiness to
				give into the hands of Mr. Timothy Smith on the following morning, if she could
				prevail upon him to deliver it.</p>
			<p>Mr. Prescot performed his part of the business ably, for the portly miller was
				waiting for the ladies in the parlour when they returned from their early walk.</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton possessed a sort of instinctive skill in reading the human
				countenance, which rarely deceived her, and it took her not long to discover that
				the man she had now to deal with was one upon whom it would be folly to waste any
				arguments which did not affect his own interest. She, therefore, briefly stated the
				fact that it was of great importance to her to obtain sight of all the apprentices
				at Deep Valley Mill, having great reason to hope that she should find a young
				relative there, for whose release from all engagements she was willing to pay
				handsomely.</p>
			<p>"It is not the custom, ma'am, to admit visiters at that factory. It have been found
				to hinder the work," replied the miller solemnly.</p>
			<p>"So I understand, sir. But, hearing that you are in the habit of visiting the mill on
				business, I have taken the liberty to send for you in order to say, that if you
				would undertake to deliver this note to Mr. Woodcomb, the manager, I would willingly
				give you five pounds for your trouble."</p>
			<p>"That is hardly enough, ma'am, for the risk of offending so good a customer," replied
				the miller.</p>
			<p>"Will double that sum induce you to do it for me?" said Mary.</p>
			<p>"On what day do you wish it to reach Mr. Woodcomb's hands?" demanded Mr. Timothy
				Smith, endeavouring to retain a doubtful expression of countenance.</p>
			<p>"To-day, sir; as early as possible."</p>
			<p>"Then, ma'am, I'll be fair and open with you, and not go about to mince the matter,
				or deceive you in any way. If you will pay me down twenty pounds in gold, or Bank of
				England notes, I will consent to give up all the important business I had fixed to
				do this morning, and undertake, not only to give your letter to Mr. Woodcomb, but to
				use my influence with him — which is greater than you may guess for — to make him do
				what you wish, provided that you treat him with the liberality which a gentleman
				like him has a right to expect."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton drew forth her pocket-book.</p>
			<pb n="251"/>
			<p>"I will give you the twenty pounds you demand, Mr. Smith," she said in a tone as
				business-like and decided as his own, "if you perform my errand successfully. I will
				give you this ten-pound note now, as payment for conveying the letter, and another
				of the same value when you return to me with the manager's permission to see the
				children who are apprenticed at the mill."</p>
			<p>Mr. Timothy Smith looked at Miss Brotherton's pocket-book and he looked at her. His
				glance at the first inspired a strong inclination to increase his demands; but the
				miller had studied the human countenance as well as the lady, and when he looked at
				her he felt certain that though young, rich, and very eager in pursuit of her
				object, she was not a fool, and that if he pushed her to a more preposterous payment
				than he had already proposed, she would be likely enough to turn about and look for
				another agent. He therefore demurely replied, "It is all fair, ma'am; I agree to the
				terms."</p>
			<p>And without wasting any further time, the man of the mill received the note, put on
				his hat, and departed.</p>
			<p>Not all Mary's self-command, and, considering all things, she had a great deal, could
				enable her to await the return of her costly messenger with composure. All that she
				heard of this mysterious mill tended to prove that it was precisely such a place as
				Sir Matthew Dowling would be likely to fix upon as the abode of Michael. The more
				she meditated the more she became convinced that the boy was there, and she was hot
				and cold, pale and red, a dozen times in an hour.</p>
			<p>She had kept a copy of her letter to the manager, that she might show it to Mr. Bell,
				from whom she hoped to receive absolution for the innocent fraud she had practised.
				To read and re-read this letter, and to speculate with Mrs. Tremlett upon its
				probable and possible effects, occupied some portion of the tedious time; slowly
				dragging her steps up and down Mrs. Prescot's little garden, and occasionally
				sitting for a fidgety five minutes in a bower of scarlet-runners, employed the rest.
				But the morning seemed endless, and more than once she suspected that her watch
				stood still.</p>
			<p>The important letter to Mr. Woodcomb was as follows:</p>
			<quote><p>"Sir, — A wealthy and respectable family have recently had reason to believe that a
				dear child, long considered as lost, has been sent as an apprentice to Mr. Elgood
				Sharpton's factory at Deep Valley. Fully aware that the examination necessary to
				prove whether this hope be well founded, must be attended with considerable trouble
				to you — inasmuch as the children must be brought out from their work for me to see,
				I beg to say that, if, without giving me further trouble, you will permit this, I
				will pay the sum of one hundred pounds for the accommodation. Should it be refused,
				I must have recourse to other means for the purpose of ascertaining what it is so
				important for me to know.</p>
			<p>
				"I am, Sir,
			</p>
			<p>"Your obedient servant, " Dorcas Tremlett. "</p></quote>
			<p> It was not till five o'clock in the afternoon, by which time Mary was fully
				persuaded that her commission had failed, that Mr. Timothy <pb n="252"/> Smith, in
				his white hat and well-powdered blue coat, was again seen approaching the King's
				Head. The heiress, who was sitting near the window, started up, and would certainly
				have stepped forward to meet him, had not Mrs. Tremlett whispered. "Sit down, Miss
				Mary, sit down, there's a darling, and look like a great lady as you did this
				morning; and that's what you are, and always should be." </p>
			<p>Mary reseated herself, and, after a short interval, the miller knocked at the
				parlour-door, and was desired to enter. Miss Brotherton pointed to a chair, and he
				rested himself. "The weather is warm, ladies," said he, drawing forth a cotton
				handkerchief, and wiping his head and face, "and I have not loitered in my errand,
				as you may see by the state I'm in; but my horse is getting in years, like his
				master, and it's no easy work to drive him by such a road as that I have comed
				by."</p>
			<p>"Have you succeeded, sir?" said Miss Brotherton, looking as grand as Mrs. Tremlett
				could desire.</p>
			<p>"I am happy to say, ma'am," he replied, with dignity, "that the second ten pounds is
				fairly won."</p>
			<p>"I rejoice to hear it," cried Mary, brightly colouring; "and I shall have great
				pleasure in paying it. When, sir, may I see these children?" she added, pulling out
				her pocket-book as she spoke.</p>
			<p>"Here, ma'am, is Mr. Woodcomb's reply to your note, and on the reading of that, I
				look to hear you say that the ten pounds is mine."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton took the dirty epistle offered her, and read: — </p>
			<quote><p>"Madam, — My employer is strict in his orders not to let the hands be interrupted, as
				they too often are in some mills, to gratify the idle curiosity of strangers. But in
				consideration of your handsome proposal, and hoping that you won't scruple to follow
				it with a like sum in case of your finding and carrying away the child, which will
				be no more than just, seeing that if I part with a hand I must get another in the
				place of it, on this condition I am willing that all the children on the premises
				shall be placed in the feeding-room for your inspection at twelve o'clock
				to-morrow.</p>
			<p>
				"I am, Madam,
			</p>
			<p>"Your humble servant, " James Woodcomb. "</p></quote>
			<p>The miller kept his eye fixed upon her as she read, and the result he looked for
				followed the perusal of the despatch he had brought. Miss Brotherton handed the
				letter to her friend, and then drew the promised bank-note from her pocket-book. The
				jolly miller rose, and received it from her hands. "I thank you, madam," said he,
				folding it carefully, "and I beg to say, in return, that you would have been
				troubled to find another man who could have done your errand as well."</p>
			<p>"I am quite satisfied, sir," she replied, "and will only ask in addition to what you
				have already done for me, that you would be obliging enough to tell me by what
				conveyance it will be best for us to get to the factory to-morrow? Mr. Woodcomb, as
				you probably know, has named twelve o'clock. I suppose the distance is too great for
				us to walk?"</p>
			<pb n="253"/>
			<p>"Quite impossible, ma'am — altogether out of the question. But I shall have no
				objection to hire out my chay-cart for the day, if so be you would think that
				suitable," said the obliging miller.</p>
			<p>"I have no doubt it would do perfectly well, provided you have a horse that can draw
				it — I should be sorry to lose time in going, and should not choose to be later than
				the hour appointed," replied Mary.</p>
			<p>"I'll look to having a fitting horse, ma'am, and one as is used to the road, and that
				is what but few are. The road is no very good one in parts, that's the truth, and
				I'm not over sure that there's another man besides myself that would like to
				undertake the job; but I've no objection to driving you myself, ladies, provided you
				think it worth while to pay a tradesman for the loss of his time — of course I can't
				charge my labour like a postboy."</p>
			<p>"If you take means, sir, to get us to Deep Valley Mill, by the hour appointed, and
				drive us back again safely to this house, we shall not dispute about the price. But
				remember, if you please, that the carriage, or cart, or whatever it is, must have
				accommodation for the child I hope to bring away with me."</p>
			<p>"I will take care of that, ma'am. I will put a little stool in on purpose — and I
				think if I say two guineas, ma'am, for the job, which is no easy one, that you can't
				complain of the price."</p>
			<p>"I certainly shall not complain of it," said Miss Brotherton.</p>
			<p>Nine o'clock was then fixed as the hour of setting out, and Mr. Timothy Smith
				departed.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Prescot's roast chicken and French beans were treated very differently from her
				previous breakfast and luncheon. Mary Brotherton was in higher spirits than she had
				enjoyed for many weeks — she felt confident of success, and for the first time in
				her life, perhaps, fully enjoyed the possession of the wealth which gave her such
				power of surmounting difficulties. The kind-hearted Mrs. Tremlett was at length as
				sanguine, and almost as happy as herself; and very freely confessed, again and
				again, that her dear young lady knew ten times better how to manage things than she
				did, old as she was.</p>
			<p>The evening was again spent in a long late ramble, and though they did not forget
				that over a certain towering height, pointed out by Mrs. Prescot, lay the dismal
				spot called the Deep Valley, the exceeding happiness which was anticipated for one
				who dwelt there, made them almost forget the misery of the rest.</p>

			<p>MISS BROTHERTON AND HER FRIEND ARRIVE AT THE DEEP VALLEY — A REVIEW — DISAPPOINTMENT
				— "A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRIKES" THE HEIRESS — SHE CONCLUDES A BARGAIN, THOUGH NOT THE
				ONE FOR WHICH SHE MEDITATED — SHE SETS OUT UPON A WALK.</p>
			<p>Mr. Timothy Smith was punctual to his appointment, and at a very few minutes past
				nine, Mrs. Tremlett and Mary were jogging along in the miller's jockey-cart, on a
				seat whereon cushions, that looked very like pillows, had been carefully strapped,
				and with a little stool placed before them, the sight of which conjured up so
				delightful a picture of the manner in which they should return, and the joy it would
				be her lot to confer, and to witness, that the pretty eyes of the heiress sparkled
				through tears of pleasure, and she would not have exchanged her present expedition
				for the best party of pleasure that ever was devised by man.</p>
			<p>A considerable part of the way was the same as that followed by Mr. Parsons when he
				conveyed Michael to the factory, and need not be again described. The tranquil
				loneliness of that portion of the road which ran along the stream, before it made
				the turn which brought the hideous prison-house in sight, lulled her spirits into a
				state that but ill prepared her for the aspect of the grim, desolate-looking
				dwelling into whose recesses she was about to penetrate; and when it suddenly became
				visible, something like a groan escaped her.</p>
			<p>"I hope that jolt didn't hurt you, ma'am?" said the miller, turning towards her.
				"Here we are, safe and sound, and that's half my bargain, at any rate."</p>
			<p>The vehicle drew up to a small door in the exterior wall of the extensive enclosure
				in which the buildings stood; Mr. Smith threw the reins upon the neck of his horse,
				and bringing his stout person cautiously to the ground, offered his services to
				assist the two ladies in doing the same.</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton trembled as she stood waiting till the miller's summons at the door
				should be answered. Now that the moment was come which was to decide the question of
				her success or failure, she no longer felt the same confidence which had cheered her
				while the trial was still distant, and her heart sunk with anticipated
				disappointment. Several minutes of irksome delay gave her time to dwell on these
				oppressive forebodings; and when the door was at length slowly and cautiously opened
				by Mr. Woodcomb himself, her pale face spoke such painful anxiety, that the
				suspicious guardian of the unholy spot was comforted from the satisfactory
				conviction that her tale was true, and that she came not under any false pretences
				to look at that which he considered it to be the first duty of his life to
				conceal.</p>
			<pb n="255"/>
			<p>"Good morning, Smith — all's right, and all's ready for you. Walk in, ladies, if you
				please," said the stern manager, relaxing his habitual frown, and intending to be
				extremely gracious.</p>
			<p>Mary and her friend stepped forward, and heard the stout lock and two heavy bolts
				secured behind them.</p>
			<p>"This way, ladies, this way, if you please; there is no need to trouble you to enter
				the factory, which, do what we will to keep it nice, can never be quite free from
				dust. You are a trifle after your time, Mr. Smith, but it's no matter; dinner time
				is over, but if the ladies will walk into this room they shall have all
				satisfaction. Howsomever, as the young uns is again at work, I can't well stop the
				mills to march 'em in all together. Nevertheless, I don't see but it may be quite as
				agreeable, or may be more, for the ladies to look at 'em one or two at a time."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton did not attempt to speak, but placed herself in a chair near the open
				door, and bent her head to indicate that she was satisfied with the proposed
				arrangement.</p>
			<p>"You had best walk this way with me, Mr. Smith," said the amiable Woodcomb, "the
				ladies look quite agitated, as is but natural, and would sooner be without strangers
				I don't doubt." A proposal which truly was a welcome one to all parties — for Mrs.
				Tremlett and Mary longed to be at liberty to speak without restraint — Mr. Smith was
				thirsting for his accustomed mug of ale, and the manager himself bursting to make a
				few inquiries respecting his mysterious visiters.</p>
			<p>"Have you seen the colour of their money yet, friend Smith?" — were the first words
				uttered as they crossed the court.</p>
			<p>"Twenty good pounds," replied the miller, expressively patting the pocket where the
				treasure lay, "and given as freely as if it had been twenty pence — out of a full
				pocket-book, too, Mr. Woodcomb, I can tell you that — and I can tell you besides,
				that your money's as sure as the bank, and your customer one as is thinking of her
				own concerns and not of yours."</p>
			<p>"That's what I'm judging too, Mr. Smith. One can see in a minute if folks eyes are
				roving here and there, up and down, to take account of all they can see. God grant
				that those poor whey-faced females may find what they want, and we shall both of us
				have made a good day's work of it. I sha'n't wish the thing talked of, that's a
				fact, not but what I shall be ready with an answer, if I'm troubled with questions.
				People as have money to throw about, like these folks, are not to be put off with a
				short word, and a lock turned in their faces. It mayn't chance once in a century
				that any such should trouble themselves concerning the cart-loads of live lumber as
				we takes off to relieve the overstocked parishes. But now it <hi>is</hi> come to
				pass, in course we must manage to get through it quietly — so I'm not without my
				answer, Mr. Smith, if the squire should hear of it, and make a riot."</p>
			<p>"No, to be sure you arn't — besides there's no need to say nothing," replied the
				miller.</p>
			<p> Mr. Woodcomb, in answer to this, gave an assenting nod, and an <pb n="256"/>
				approving smile. "Now then, my man," said he, more gaily than he often uttered any
				thing, "sit you down here, and you shall presently have a snack and a mug to keep
				you company. I'll see myself to the turning in a few of the hands at a time, to be
				looked at. For I have been thinking the matter over, Master Miller, and I judge it
				will make ten times less talk and tumult that way, than if they were all turned out
				at once. I'll have out a few boys and girls together, chance-like, just as they come
				— and ten to one nobody but Poulet will find out that there's any thing more going
				on than some job, as I wants to get done." </p>
			<p>Mr. Woodcomb accordingly proceeded to the different parts of the large establishment,
				and contrived, without stopping the work any where, to perform the task he had
				undertaken. As the selected children came forth from the various rooms, he told them
				to cross the court to the 'prentice-house, where they would find one as wanted to
				look at them, adding an order to come back again as quick as light, "if they didn't
				wish to be strapped dead."</p>
			<p>Whenever such promises were made, Mr. Woodcomb was known to be strictly a man of his
				word; and Mary and her friend had soon gazed with anxious eyes and shuddering hearts
				upon a greater number of half-starved trembling little wretches, than could possibly
				have been made to pass before them in an equally short space of time, by any other
				mode or process whatever.</p>
			<p>They came so quickly in succession, however, that no interval was left in which Miss
				Brotherton and her faithful attendant could exchange a word on the melancholy
				panorama of human misery that passed before them. Strange and unwonted as was the
				spectacle of "two ladies sitting in the 'prentice-house," the cowed and frightened
				children, for the most part did little more than stand before her with eyes and
				mouth wide open for a single minute, and then start off again, while Mary herself
				aided the celerity of the process by a shake of the head, and a wave of the hand,
				which indicated plainly enough that they were not to stay, but go.</p>
			<p>"What a multitude, nurse Tremlett!" she exclaimed at length, her spirits worn with
				repeated disappointments, and the contemplation of the wretched creatures for whom
				she knew she brought no help. "The train seems endless!"</p>
			<p>The old woman returned her a speaking look, and whispered in her ear — "Could you not
				question them, Mary? Might not this dismal work be shortened by your asking them if
				the boy is here? They can't have any reason to hide him. They can't be agents of Sir
				Matthew."</p>
			<p>Mary took the hint, and said to the next young skeleton that presented itself — "Can
				you tell me if there is a boy here named Michael Armstrong?"</p>
			<p> The result was a stupid and silent stare, and, without answering, the child darted
				off like the rest. Thrice she repeated the question, but with no better success, for
				two out of the three were among those newly arrived to supply vacancies caused by
				the late mortality, and the third <pb n="257"/> from working and sleeping in another
				chamber, had never heard poor Michael's name. "No!" was pronounced by this one, "No,
				ma'am," by the two new comers, and Mary's heart almost failing her, she resumed her
				silent examination. In truth there was in most of the unhappy faces that thus
				presented themselves, such a look of blighted intellect, and dogged apathy, that she
				clung to the ever-lessening hope of seeing the boy appear, in preference to any
				further questioning. And thus the coming and going lasted for another half-hour
				without a word being spoken. </p>
			<p>At length the sad monotony of the spectacle was broken, at least to the eyes of Mary,
				by the appearance of a little girl, who though pale and lamentably thin, had not yet
				lost thereby the sweet expression of her delicate features, neither had the soul
				within yielded to the paralyzing influence of the hopeless, helpless, unvarying
				misery by which she was surrounded. Her soft gray eyes still retained their eloquent
				power of speaking, and the look of surprise, mixed with something that was almost
				approaching to pleasure, with which she fixed them upon Mary's face caused her to
				make a sudden movement to detain her, as the child, following the example of the
				rest, was turning away. At first this movement was caused entirely by the interest
				which the little creature herself inspired — but it almost immediately occurred to
				her, that here, at length, there was a chance of receiving a rational and
				intelligent answer to any question she might ask; and such strength did this idea
				gain as she continued to look at the child, that she told Mrs. Tremlett to stop the
				approach of those who were coming on, and by keeping them waiting in the court for a
				minute or two, to give her time to see if she could not learn something from this
				most interesting-looking little creature. Mrs. Tremlett showed that she too thought
				something might now be hoped for, and with great alacrity stepped out into the court
				to meet the fresh arrivals, shutting, to Mary's extreme satisfaction, the door of
				the room behind her.</p>
			<p>"My dear little girl!" said Miss Brotherton, taking the child's pale and slender hand
				in hers, "How came you in this sad place? You do not look as if you were used to
				it."</p>
			<p>"Not for very long, ma'am," was the reply.</p>
			<p>"But you have been here during the few last weeks?"</p>
			<p>"I have been here for several months," answered the little girl.</p>
			<p>"Can you tell me" — and Mary almost gasped as she asked the question — "Can you tell
				me, if there be a boy here called Michael Armstrong?"</p>
			<p>The look of modest and well-pleased curiosity with which the soft eyes were fixed on
				Mary's face, was instantly changed for an expression of deep anguish — for a few
				moments no reply was uttered, and large tears were already chasing each other down
				her cheeks before the trembling child found voice to speak; at last she uttered,
				almost in a whisper, and still looking through her tears in Mary's face — "Michael
				Armstrong is dead!"</p>
			<p> "Dead! — Oh, do not say so!" cried Mary, in a voice so shrill as <pb n="258"/> to
				reach the ears of Mrs. Tremlett, who immediately opening the door, close to which
				she had been stationed, entered in dismay, exclaiming, </p>
			<p>"What is the matter, Mary? For Heaven's sake, tell me, was it you who cried out in
				such a piercing voice?"</p>
			<p>Several of the children, who were by this time assembled in the court, followed at
				her heels, thrusting open the door, and staring at the scene before them.</p>
			<p>"Shut the door, Nurse Tremlett! — Send them away — send them all away — I have no
				further need to see them!" said poor Mary, weeping from sorrow, disappointment, and
				complete prostration of spirits. Before she spoke another word, Mrs. Tremlett obeyed
				her instructions, and gently pushing back the curious throng, closed and bolted the
				door.</p>
			<p>"Now tell me then, my poor dear child, what new sorrow has come upon you? Sure
				nothing dreadful has happened to the poor little fellow?"</p>
			<p>"Nurse Tremlett, he is dead!" replied Mary, weeping afresh, as if the boy had indeed
				been her brother.</p>
			<p>"Lack-a-day for his poor mother!" cried Mrs. Tremlett, "these are bad tidings to take
				home with us, after all our trouble and pains. Oh, Mary, dear, I wish you had never
				left your home!"</p>
			<p>"Say not so, Mrs. Tremlett," said Mary, recovering herself, "certainty is ever better
				than doubt — and here, here is one I may still save from misery. What is your name,
				my dear child, and who was it sent you to this dreadful place?"</p>
			<p>"My name is Fanny Fletcher," said the little girl, "and it was mother's parish that
				sent me here as soon as she was dead."</p>
			<p>"Have you no other friends? — no relations any where who could take care of you?"
				demanded Miss Brotherton, with quickness.</p>
			<p>"No, ma'am, nobody," replied Fanny; but, in saying this, the child ceased to weep,
				and, young as she was, an expression of such hopeless, yet enduring composure took
				possession of her beautiful features, that Mary's memory instantly applied to her
				Byron's thrilling words — "My thoughts their dungeon know too well; Back to my
				breast the wanderers shrink, And bleed within their secret cell." </p>
			<p>"Tell me, Fanny," she said, "tell me quickly, should you not like to come away from
				this place? I came here to take away poor Michael Armstrong. I was to pay money for
				taking him, and I will pay it now for <hi>you</hi> , if you will tell me that you
				wish to come, and will be a good girl to me."</p>
			<p>"Poor Michael!" said Fanny, while her tears again began to flow.</p>
			<p> "Speak, Fanny! shall I take you with me?" cried Mary, impatiently, for she heard
				without the door the sound of a heavy step approaching. Fanny Fletcher heard it too,
				and an almost ghastly <pb n="259"/> paleness spread itself over her face and lips,
				she seemed chocking, and perfectly unable to articulate, but clasping her hands
				together, and dropping on her knees before Miss Brotherton, raised her eloquent eyes
				to her face with a look which required no commentary. </p>
			<p>"Open the door, Mrs. Tremlett!" said Mary. "Don't you hear the knocking? This is the
				child I shall take away with me," she added in a whisper, and with a look that her
				friend perfectly understood.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett opened the door, and the well-pleased Mr. Woodcomb stood before
				them.</p>
			<p>"That's well," he said, looking at the kneeling child, and at Mary, whose arm
				encircled her neck, with an air of great complacency. "I thought by what those said,
				as you sent back without looking at 'em, that you had found what you wanted. And
				now, ladies, I hope you remember the conditions."</p>
			<p>"Do not doubt it, sir," replied Miss Brotherton, instantly drawing forth her
				pocket-book. Here is a note of one hundred pounds to repay the trouble I have given
				you, and here, a second of the same value to atone for the loss of Fanny's
				labour."</p>
			<p>"All right, ma'am," said Mr. Woodcomb, very graciously, "and if you had but told me
				that it was a little girl, with a very pretty face, and that her name was Fanny, I
				could have saved you all your trouble, for we don't happen to have another that
				would answer to that description."</p>
			<p>"I have taken no trouble, sir, that I at all regret," replied Miss Brotherton, "but I
				am anxious to set off on my return without any further loss of time. Will you have
				the kindness to inquire if Mr. Smith is ready?"</p>
			<p>"I don't doubt, ma'am, but he will be ready to obey orders, though the horse have
				hardly been baited well yet. Howsomever, those as pay well generally looks to have
				things done in a little less time than other folks; and it's very right and fair
				that so it should be. If a horse can stand, he ought to go, if his owner is well
				paid — there is no doubt of it."</p>
			<p>"I should be sorry to distress the horse," said Mary, "and if he be not sufficiently
				rested, we must wait."</p>
			<p>"At your pleasure, ladies, at your pleasure. Pray sit down and make yourselves
				comfortable. And of course your ladyship would like to have this pretty little girl
				here made as decent as we can manage; the dirtiest part of her clothes can be
				changed easy, though the missis of the 'prentice-house being lately dead, puts us
				out a little in our management. However, if little Miss Fanny, as we must call her
				now, will please to come up stairs with me, I can make her look a deal better, I
				will answer for it."</p>
			<p> Fanny Fletcher having been raised from her kneeling position by the hand of Miss
				Brotherton, still continued to hold that hand tightly, and the young lady now felt
				so strong a compression of her fingers, and was at the same time conscious of so
				tremulous a movement in <pb n="260"/> the person of the child, as she nestled
				closely to her, that she felt persuaded the proposal of Mr. Woodcomb had frightened
				her. </p>
			<p>"You are very kind," she replied, drawing the child, sordid as its wretched garments
				were, still closer to her, "you are very kind, sir. But I shall prefer taking her
				away, exactly as I first looked upon her."</p>
			<p>"Dear me! only to think of that now! That's the beauty of what's called natural
				affection! Then if you will please to keep seated I'll go tell Miller Smith as
				you're ready, and all the business done, so as he may set off as soon as he is
				able."</p>
			<p>Mary again thanked him for his civility, but felt disposed to think that he might
				have executed his mission more satisfactorily, when he returned in about three
				minutes, with the assurance that Master Smith would be ready to start in little less
				than an hour.</p>
			<p>An hour at that moment seemed to Miss Brotherton an almost interminable space of
				time; she felt painfully conscious of being, "confined and pent up" with sin and
				suffering. Heated, agitated, and impatient — panting for the fresh air, and longing
				to question her little purchased protégée, concerning poor Michael, she determined
				to walk forward on the road they had that morning traversed, and letting Mr. Smith
				and his cart overtake them.</p>
			<p>"Should you dislike walking on, Mrs. Tremlett?" she said. "My head aches, and I am
				sure nothing will relieve me but a walk."</p>
			<p>"I should like it too, my dear," replied her observant companion, looking anxiously
				in her face, and perfectly understanding her feelings.</p>
			<p>"Walk, ladies!" exclaimed Mr. Woodcomb, looking exceedingly shocked, "ladies such as
				you to walk out upon our wild moors? Oh dear no! That is quite impossible!"</p>
			<p>This was said to prove at once his tender care of personages possessing the power of
				dispensing hundreds, and to show that he was not unacquainted with the refinements
				of polite society; but this civilly-intended opposition to their exit produced on
				his hearers an effect very different from what he intended.</p>
			<p>That Fanny Fletcher should tremble at the mention of delay was not extraordinary, but
				that Mary should hear again, in fancy, the grating sound of the locks and bars,
				which had closed behind her as she entered, and feel a sick qualm at her heart, as
				if she were betrayed, and doomed to remain in that hateful spot against her will,
				showed that her nerves had indeed been severely shaken, and that her heroism had
				more of zeal than strength in it.</p>
			<p> Mrs. Tremlett, too, looked exceedingly annoyed, though certainly without the same
				lively recollection of the bolts and bars; but she was so accustomed to consult the
				wishes of her young companion, and to feel at ease herself only when she saw her so,
				that she too coloured with impatience, and sustaining admirably her character of
				aunt, said, "I beg pardon, sir, but I know my niece's constitution so well, that I
				am quite sure the jolting of that rough cart would not do for her just <pb n="261"/>
				at present. She is a great walker, and a mile or so, creeping along in the fresh
				air, will do her a deal of good." </p>
			<p>"In course you know best, ladies, and I can't, for certain, take the liberty to
				oppose. But, by your leave, I'll just mention your plan to Mr. Smith before you
				start, and then, maybe he'll be for pushing on his horse a little."</p>
			<p>So saying, Mr. Woodcomb left them; when Mary, turning to the little girl, said, "Have
				you any bonnet and shawl to put on, Fanny?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," replied the child.</p>
			<p>"Not know? How can that be, Fanny?"</p>
			<p>"Because I have never been out of the doors since I first came into them," said
				Fanny.</p>
			<p>"Poor dear! I wish they would not keep you here any longer — this is quite
				intolerable!" said Mary, again opening the door, and looking impatiently across the
				dismal court.</p>
			<p>"Keep me here?" murmured the little girl, in a voice of the most evident terror. "Do
				you think they will keep me here?"</p>
			<p>"No, no, my poor child, they shall not keep you here," said Mrs. Tremlett, kindly.
				"Here come the two men together."</p>
			<p>Fanny did not venture to look at them, but Mary did; and again, in spite of her
				reason, she felt terrified at the idea that she was in their power. Mr. Woodcomb,
				indeed, looked smiling and obsequious as before, but in the countenance of the burly
				miller there was something of opposition and displeasure that she could not
				understand.</p>
			<p>"Setting off walking, miss, is very like bilking your driver," said he, with
				considerably more bluntness than civility.</p>
			<p>"What does he mean, Mrs. Tremlett?" said Mary, turning pale.</p>
			<p>"You had better pay the gentleman before you set out, my dear. That's what you mean
				to say, isn't it, sir?"</p>
			<p>"Why surely, ma'am, it would be more like doing business," replied the man, looking a
				little ashamed of himself.</p>
			<p>"Is that all?" said Mary, inexpressibly relieved, and drawing out her ready purse
				with such cheerful alacrity, that could the hearts of the two men before whom she
				stood have been read, there might have been found in both a strong inclination to
				profit by it a little further.</p>
			<p>"That, I think, sir, is the sum you named for the hire of your vehicle?" said Mary,
				extending her hand with two sovereigns towards him.</p>
			<p>Mr. Timothy Smith took the money, but certainly thought that if that sharp-eyed rogue
				Woodcomb had been further he might have hit upon some excuse for demanding more. As
				it was, however, he could not venture it, and with a rather surly inclination of the
				head, pocketed the gold, and left the room.</p>
			<p>"Now then, sir, if you please," said the still frightened Mary, "we will wish you
				good morning."</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am, surely, you can go if you please. Only perhaps you might like, for the
				honour of your young relation here, to leave some little gratuity to be divided as a
				little treat among her late companions?"</p>
			<pb n="262"/>
			<p>Mary looked in his face, and the sort of half-ashamed glance with which the
				extortioner watched the effect of his words, appeared to her so sinister, that with
				a sudden feeling of something like rational alarm, she remembered that she had only
				a few shillings left in her purse, and that again to open in his presence her still
				well-filled pocket-book, might be dangerous.</p>
			<p>"Aunt Tremlett, have you any money to lend me?" she said, at the same time drawing
				out again her almost empty purse. "I am very sorry I have only these few shillings
				left; but I will willingly send you five pounds, sir, for the purpose you mention,
				if the miller will take the trouble of bringing it to you."</p>
			<p>"Oh! It's no matter, ladies. Pray do not trouble yourselves any more about it,"
				replied Woodcomb, keeping his eyes, however, furtively directed towards Mrs.
				Tremlett, who was still engaged in seeking for money in the recesses of a very large
				pocket.</p>
			<p>"I have two pounds and a few shillings, my dear," said the old lady, at length
				placing her little leathern purse in Mary's hand.</p>
			<p>"That will do, that will do perfectly," said the worshipper of Mammon, with an air
				and tone of the most amiable liberality, but at the same time stretching out his
				hand, in which he received the entire contents, uncounted, of Mrs. Tremlett's purse,
				which Miss Brotherton unclasped, and emptied into it.</p>
			<p>Had she studied the man's character for years, she could not have devised any
				manoeuvre so likely to hasten the unlocking the door which enclosed them as thus
				emptying their two purses before his eyes. He now moved forward of his own accord,
				drew forth from the pocket of his coat the massive key, applied it with a large,
				strong, and effective hand, to the enormous lock, drew back the heavy bolts, and
				finally threw wide the hateful door.</p>
			<p>The three females passed through it with no lingering steps, and heard it close
				heavily behind them, with feelings assuredly very different in degree, but in so far
				the same, that each one as she stepped over the threshold, breathed a prayer that
				she might never repass it again.</p>
		</div><div type="chapter">
			<head> CHAPTER XXIV. </head>
			<p>THE WALK PROVES TOO FATIGUING TO ONE OF THE PARTY, BUT NOT TO MISS BROTHERTON — SHE
				WANDERS FURTHER, AND MEETS WITH AN ADVENTURE, BUT AT LAST RETURNS IN SAFETY TO HER
				INN — A JOURNEY HOMEWARD, AND A FACT RELATED WITHOUT ORNAMENT.</p>
			<p>
				It is but a dreary and desolate landscape which greets the eye
				immediately without the walls of the Deep Valley factory; but to all who <pb n="263"/> are happy enough to feel that they are quitting those hideous walls for ever, it
				can hardly fail to convey a sense of beauty, freshness, and freedom, sufficient to
				expand the heart with admiration and delight. Mary felt disposed to bound along the
				grassy path beside the stream with the joyous playfulness of a child, and rather
				than have re-entered that creaking door again, would have been tempted, like another
				Undine, to plunge into the water, and take her chance of finding quarters less
				hateful beneath its rippling wave. Mrs. Tremlett breathed more freely, and seemed to
				have recovered the elastic step of youth, as she moved briskly on. But compared with
				what was passing in the breast of the ragged, dirty little creature that walked
				beside them, their feelings were most earthly cold and dull. Her small hand was
				still clasped in that of Miss Brotherton, who felt that the child was urging her
				onward, even faster than she was inclined to go, while her head upturned towards the
				towering heights which hemmed them in, seemed eagerly seeking an outlet from the
				region that her soul abhorred. </p>
			<p>"You are glad, dear Fanny, are you not, to know that you have left that frightful
				place?" said Mary, kindly pressing the little emaciated hand she held in hers. The
				child stopped short in her hurried walk, and looking up in her deliverer's face,
				with a doubting anxious look that it was painful to see, murmured very softly, and
				as if fearing to be overheard from within the walls,</p>
			<p>"Shall I never, never go back again?"</p>
			<p>"No, never Fanny! Do you think I would be so cruel as to take you back?" said
				Mary.</p>
			<p>"I do not know if it is not all a dream," replied the child. "I have dreamed that I
				saw green grass, and felt the air upon my face, before."</p>
			<p>"Do not be afraid, Fanny! You are not dreaming now," returned Mary. "Run on, and
				gather that fine large stalk of foxglove. You never saw such a gay flower as that in
				your dreams, did you?"</p>
			<p>The little girl sprang forward, and falling upon her knees on the grass, plucked the
				tall flower, and pressed it to her lips, and to her heart. But though this was a
				childish action, it was not done childishly: there was an appearance of deep
				feeling, and even of devotion in her look and attitude which strongly awakened
				Mary's interest, and when the little creature rose again, and holding the flower in
				one hand, slid the other once more into that of her new friend, the heart of that
				friend yearned towards her with newly-awakened tenderness. But when she spoke to
				her, and endeavoured to lead her into conversation, the attempt entirely failed.
				There are many who might have felt disappointed and chilled by this; but Mary
				Brotherton had truer sympathy, and as, from time to time, she felt a loving
				contraction of Fanny's little fingers upon her own, and sometimes caught her looking
				up, as if by stealth into her face, she felt no misgivings as to the cause of her
				silence, but loved her the better from knowing that her heart was too full to
				speak.</p>
			<p> They all, and as if moved by one common impulse, walked quickly <pb n="264"/>
				forward as long as their road continued along the margin of the stream; but when it
				turned round the steep hill's base, and began to mount, their pace relaxed, Mary
				felt that her little companion dragged on her steps with labour, and perceived that
				Mrs. Tremlett was out of breath. </p>
			<p>"Let us sit down under this ash-tree, and wait for the jolly miller," said Miss
				Brotherton, "it cannot be very long, I think, before he overtakes us."</p>
			<p>This proposal was the more amiable, because, in the first place, Mary could herself
				have run from the bottom of that steep hill to the top, almost without perceiving
				that it was any hill at all; and in the next, she so exceedingly disliked both the
				miller and his cart, that had she consulted her own inclinations alone, she would
				probably have preferred retracing the whole way on foot.</p>
			<p>But very gladly was her proposal for rest accepted, by both her old and young
				companion, and long did they remain seated under their pleasant canopy before they
				any of them grew weary of it; till at length, after consulting her watch, Miss
				Brotherton expressed a doubt whether the fat miller and his lazy steed intended to
				overtake them at all.</p>
			<p>"Good gracious, my dear! do you really think so?" said Mrs. Tremlett, considerably
				alarmed. "Why, Mary, we shall never get back to Mrs. Prescot's without him!"</p>
			<p>"I hope I may be mistaken, my dear old woman," said her kind mistress,
				affectionately; "for I fear such a walk would be too much for you. But when I
				remember that he is paid, and remember, likewise, how very little he seemed actuated
				by any motive, save that of sordid interest, I confess that I do think it very
				probable he means to leave us in the lurch."</p>
			<p>"Then let us walk on, Miss Mary, without saying a word more about it. The shadows are
				beginning to grow long already, and you shan't be kept out half the night by my
				laziness. Come along, little girl."</p>
			<p>With these words, Mrs. Tremlett raised herself from between two comfortable roots,
				which had made her an excellent arm-chair; but the little girl whom she summoned to
				do likewise, though she exerted herself to get on her feet, seemed hardly able to
				stand.</p>
			<p>"My poor Fanny, you are quite knocked up!" exclaimed Miss Brotherton, looking at her
				with great anxiety. "How in the world shall we ever be able to get her on?"</p>
			<p>"It is only because I have not been used to walk lately," said Fanny; "that is, not
				as we have been walking now. Our work keeps us always on our legs, and that makes
				them bend about so, when I try to walk; but I <hi>can</hi> walk though it hurts me,
				and I think it would be better to die outright in getting on, rather than rest so
				near the factory — so, please ma'am, I'm quite ready to go on."</p>
			<p> And again the party set off, but the difficulty with which the little Fanny got
				along became more obvious at every step, and it soon became evident that to get as
				far as Mrs. Prescot's would be impossible. <pb n="265"/> The dilemma was not a
				pleasant one. They were still in a part of the road so little frequented, that it
				was probable they might wait for hours without obtaining assistance from any passer
				by, nor did either Mrs. Tremlett or Mary recollect to have seen any dwelling nearer
				than the high-road, from which they were still at a considerable distance. </p>
			<p>The distress of the little girl was painful to witness. At the very moment when the
				dark cloud which had seemed to settle upon her was withdrawn, and hope gradually and
				with difficulty, as to eyes long unaccustomed to its light, began to reach her; at
				that very moment her strength failed, and a sensation, like the sickness of death,
				rendered every attempt at further exertion impossible.</p>
			<p>"I must stay here," she said; "it is the will of God."</p>
			<p>"No, no, Fanny," said Miss Brotherton, seating herself beside her, and letting the
				languid little head drop upon her bosom; "you have no reason to think that, while I
				have a thousand to believe the contrary. It is a most strange chance which has
				brought me here, and placed you in my hands — this was by the will of God, and I
				will not believe it has so chanced, only that I may see you die."</p>
			<p>"You must not stay here," said Fanny, feebly; "night will come presently, and you
				must go fast to get home. Do not be sorry for me — but, indeed, I think I am as bad
				as Michael was, when he fell sick, and was carried away to die."</p>
			<p>"Did you see — " began Mary, eagerly; but suddenly stopping herself, she added, "Not
				now my poor Fanny, you must not tell me about it now — when I have got you strong
				and well at my own home, we will talk of poor Michael. Try now, to think how glad
				you will be when we have got you home, and all our difficulties are over! But
				something must be done, I know, my poor child, before this can be. How had we best
				act in this dilemma, Mrs. Tremlett? Do you think you shall have courage to remain
				with this poor child while I run on, and endeavour to find some house where we may
				get assistance?"</p>
			<p>"Alone, Miss Mary?" replied the good woman, looking terribly alarmed. "How can I let
				you set off in a strange, wild country like this, with nobody to take care of you?
				Let us go together. Mary; nothing can hurt this little girl, you know, while we are
				away."</p>
			<p>"Think it over once more, dear Tremlett," said Mary, "and then I believe you will
				perceive that there is more chance of your being useful to her, than to me. I shall
				get on faster without you, good nurse, and with a lighter heart than if I took you
				for company, while this little creature was left with nothing but her own melancholy
				thoughts and childish terrors to comfort her."</p>
			<p>"Then I will stay," said the poor woman, sighing heavily: "but just think, Miss Mary,
				how I shall feel till you come back again!"</p>
			<p>"I will not loiter to amuse myself," replied her young mistress with a cheering
				smile; "and now take my place, and let this poor little head rest on your
				shoulder."</p>
			<p> "She shall lie down on that bit of level turf yonder, with her head <pb n="266"/>
				upon my lap," said the old nurse, tenderly assisting Mary to lift her up. </p>
			<p>"God bless you, my dear good soul! I will be quickly back again," replied her
				grateful mistress. "How much more you show you love me now, than if you insisted
				upon walking after me. There! she lies as nicely as if she were in bed. If our
				faithless miller makes his appearance, keep him and his cart till I come back; tell
				him he shall have more gold, and he will stand waiting beside you, as gentle as a
				lamb."</p>
			<p>Having said these comforting words, Mary instened onward and was speedily out of
				sight. Having reached the top of the hill, she looked anxiously round in search of a
				human dwelling, but nothing met her eye, but barren moor-land, which at some
				distance showed symptoms of cultivation, being enclosed in patches by low stone
				walls, and here and there the fragment of a stunted hawthorn fence, which seemed to
				sustain a hungry life with difficulty. Making her way across the rude and
				imperfectly-formed sunk fence, which marked the boundary of the cart-road, along
				which they had travelled in the morning, Mary found herself on a level of some
				extent, but without the slightest track to direct her steps amidst the long parched
				grass, and frequent stones with which it was covered.</p>
			<p>"This will never do! I may walk here till I have completely lamed myself, without a
				chance of meeting any living soul," thought Mary, stopping short; "I shall do better
				by making for the high-road at once."</p>
			<p>And having so decided, she turned about to retrace her steps, and regain the road;
				but ere she reched it, a sort of hillock at a little distance caught her eye, and
				wishing to take advantage of its elevation, for the purpose of reconnoitring, she
				turned aside to reach it. Her approach to it was from the east, and a dazzling
				sunset was in her eyes, as she made her way up the rugged side of what looked like
				one of the tumuli which served as resting-places for human bones, ere churchyards
				yawned for them. Greatly was she startled on reaching the top of it, to perceive on
				the western side, crouching in a hollow that looked as if it had been excavated by
				the shelter-seeking sheep, a strange wild figure, whose dress, as she looked down
				upon it, left its sex doubtful. The fragment of a hat, and the remnant of a jacket
				were evidently intended, by their original construction, for the use of the nobler
				sex, while something resembling a petticoat enveloping the lower half of the figure,
				suggested the probability that the masculine portion of the attire was worn by
				sufferance, and not by right.</p>
			<p>Mary's light step among the matted tufts of coarse vegetation which covered the thin
				soil, had not been heard, and she stood looking down upon her doubtful neighbour
				with the advantage of being herself unseen.</p>
			<p>"There goes another day!" said a voice, which though harsh and aged, was unmistakably
				female; "and the silly soul has got to wait for another."</p>
			<pb n="267"/>
			<p>Glad to find that her unexpected companion in this most desolate spot, was of the
				safer, because the weaker portion of the human race, the wandering heiress
				determined to address her; but deemed it wisest to approach her visibly, instead of
				startling the poor soul by speaking to her unexpectedly from the spot where she
				stood. For this purpose, she gently descended from her elevation, and making a
				little circuit, presented herself before the eyes of the sun-gazer.</p>
			<p>The old woman, for such she was, sat nose and knees together, in a sort of hole which
				completely sheltered her in every direction but the west; and from the earnest
				manner in which her dim eyes were fixed upon the last bright rays of the setting
				sun, it seemed as if her lair was chosen on purpose to look upon it.</p>
			<p>The appearance of Mary seemed to startle her, but not much; for after looking at her
				for a minute as if she examined her person with difficulty, because her eyes were
				dazzled by the object on which she had before been gazing, she said, pointing a
				stick that she held towards the point whence the bright orb had just
				disappeared,</p>
			<p>"Who be you, coming to spy out old Sally at her devotions?"</p>
			<p>"I want to find a house, my good woman, for I have left a poor child very ill at a
				short distance from hence; I want to find people who can help me to remove her."</p>
			<p>"There are no people here," said the old woman, in a gentle but melancholy voice, and
				turning her eyes round the desolate moor as if in confirmation of the assertion.</p>
			<p>"But perhaps you may be able to tell me where I can find some one?"</p>
			<p>"O dear! O dear! there is no want of finding for such as you. Just go upon the
				high-road and turn yourself about, and say, 'Come to me,' and you'll be seeing 'em
				flock in, right and left, and north and south, all bowing and scraping as genteel as
				possible. 'Tis only me as lives in a hole, and prays to the sun every night to be so
				kind as not to wake me the next morning; 'tis only me that never sees any body. I am
				the only woman in all the world — all the rest have got their death in the
				factories."</p>
			<p>There are many circumstances of more danger, that are infinitely less appalling than
				meeting, when out of sight of every other human being, a poor frail shattered
				remnant of humanity with a disordered wit. Mary shuddered as the wild speech of this
				poor creature confirmed the idea of insanity which her appearance suggested, and her
				first impulse was to turn and run. But her steps were stayed by the shrill,
				trembling voice of the old woman, who in an accent, the most helpless and forlorn,
				called after her,</p>
			<p>"One minute — only stay one minute! Let me look at you one minute!"</p>
			<p> Mary turned again, and all feeling of terror was lost in pity as she beheld the
				miserable little crippled figure which was hobbling towards her. Her height hardly
				reached that of an ordinary child of twelve years old, her gait showed that her legs
				were dreadfully deformed, her uncouth garments hung about her in tatters, and as she
				painfully <pb n="268"/> rolled herself at every step round the stick by whose aid
				she was supported, it was hardly possible to conceive a more complete image of
				poverty and decrepitude, than her whole appearance offered. </p>
			<p>"Do not hurry so!" cried Mary, every idea of alarm lost in contemplating her
				suffering helplessness. "I will not go yet, if you wish me to stay." They were now
				close together, and the shaking creature looked up in her face, with a soft, silly
				smile, that had all the woful innocence of imbecility. With a small, skinny hand
				that was delicatelypale, and perfectly clean, she took the end of Mary's silk
				scarfand gazed upon it in a sort of ecstasy. "Oh, fine! oh, pretty, pretty, pretty!"
				she exclaimed, smoothing and patting it with her hand, as if it had been a tame and
				favourite bird. "I think," she added, with a sagacious nod, "that I know where you
				come from. This is just the things, I know, that they wear in heaven — I think I
				know where you come from." Then breaking into what sounded like a genuine laugh, she
				again repeated, "I think I know where you come from — that is what the overlooker
				man said to me," she added, lowering her voice to a whisper, "when he caught me
				running away from the factory. It is not so very long ago — I can tell you all about
				it, if you would like to hear — and it is not like the rest of the things you know,"
				touching her forehead with her forefinger; "I don't tell that backwards and
				forwards, nonsense-fashion, like the other things I talk about — that was beat in
				upon my brain by the blacksmith, and nothing can ever take it out again, they say,
				till one of the angels does it in heaven. It used to pain me a good deal," she
				continued, taking off her hat, and laying her open palm on the top of her head, "but
				since I took to sitting on my throne there, as the folks call it, and gathered the
				dew morning and night to put upon it, the pain is a deal better."</p>
			<p>"I cannot hear your story now," said Mary, gently, "because there is a poor sick girl
				on the side of the hill that wants me very bad — she comes from the factory too, and
				she is too ill to walk — can you tell me where I can find any body to help me carry
				her?"</p>
			<p>"Come from the factory, is she? Dear, dear, dear, dear! She will be sure to die, you
				may depend upon it — they all do die, except me. Don't you fancy that you'll ever
				take her back alive, it was only I that could bear that, and I was burnt in the head
				for it, as I told you."</p>
			<p>"I do not want to take her back," said Mary, "I want to help her. Where do you live?
				Are there any houses or people near this place? Now, be a good woman, and take me
				where I can find somebody to help us."</p>
			<p>"Yes, I will," replied the poor creature, in a tone which convinced Miss Brotherton
				that she understood her, and at the same time beginning to hobble on before her
				towards the road.</p>
			<p> Nothing probably less pressing, and less hopeless than her present position could
				have tempted Mary to trust herself to such a guide; yet she felt a strange sort of
				confidence that the old woman knew what she was about, and though aware that the
				experiment was rather a <pb n="269"/> desperate one, determined to follow wherever
				her feeble guide should lead, certain, at least, that the distance could not be very
				great. </p>
			<p>There was, however, much more strength and power of locomotion in the little cripple
				than she gave her credit for. Having contrived to crawl through the grassy dyke that
				fenced the moor, she crossed the road obliquely, and making her way through a very
				imperfect hedge of furze and quickset, hobbled on across a bit of miserably arid
				stubble, which presently descended abruptly, and led to a tuft of stunted
				elder-bushes, besides which stood a small farm-house, with its cow-yard, barns, and
				ricks.</p>
			<p>Surprised and delighted to find herself so near a human dwelling, Mary had hardly
				patience to restrain her steps to the pace of her poor guide, nevertheless she had
				not the heart to leave her, for there was an expression of pride and pleasure in the
				woman's eye as she turned round from time to time as they advanced, which she felt
				it would be most cruel to check by showing that she could do without her. So it was
				together that they reached the bottom of the steep descent, and together that they
				entered the kitchen of the farm-house, where a very decent-looking, middle-aged
				woman was engaged in preparing supper. She looked exceedingly surprised at the
				appearance of Miss Brotherton, and for a moment turned her eyes from her to her
				companion, and back again, with an air that was almost bewildered; but soon
				recovering herself she courtesied with much respect, and said, "I hope you haven't
				been scared, ma'am, by falling in with this poor cretur? She is as harmless as a
				baby."</p>
			<p>"Oh, no!" replied Mary, "she has been very kind to me, for she has brought me here,
				where I should never have been able to get without her, the house is so completely
				concealed — and I want help, ma'am, very much indeed."</p>
			<p>"You haven't met no accident, I hope?" said the good woman, kindly, and ceasing her
				notable operations, she drew forward a wooden chair for her guest to sit upon.</p>
			<p>"Thank you very much," said the young lady, seating herself. "Yet it is not rest I
				most want. I have a little girl with me whom I have left by the side of the road
				that leads from the mills; she is too weak and ill to get on, and I hope you will be
				able to lend me some conveyance — a cart, a waggon, any thing to take her as far as
				the King's Head, three or four miles I suppose from hence, upon the turnpike-road: I
				would pay well for it."</p>
			<p>"From the mills?" repeated the woman staring</p>
			<p>"Yes; from the place called Deep Valley Mill," replied Mary, "perhaps rather more
				than a mile from here."</p>
			<p>"Oh! ma'am, I know the Deep Valley Mill well enough," was the answer. "All Mr.
				Woodcomb's own butter and milk comes from here. That is not the difficulty. But we
				shan't like to have nothing to do with carrying away any child from there."</p>
			<p>"You need fear nothing on that point," replied Miss Brotherton, eagerly, "I have paid
				for permission to bring this child away."</p>
			<p> "That alters the case for certain. But — I ask your pardon, ma'am, <pb n="270"/> —
				there is something very odd too, in such a lady as you walking away from the factory
				with one of the children." </p>
			<p>"Indeed I do not wonder at your saying so. But believe me, I tell you nothing but the
				truth when I assure you that I have permission, and have paid largely for it, to
				bring this child away. Our unfortunately attempting to walk was merely accident, and
				occasioned entirely by my foolish impatience to get away from the place before Mr.
				Smith, the miller, who took me there, thought his horse sufficiently rested to
				return."</p>
			<p>"Mr. Smith, the miller? Then for certain all's right — for they be known for the
				greatest of friends, Mr. Woodcomb and he — and I dare say my husband, ma'am, would
				be proud to help you when he comes home. It's coming dark fast, and he won't be long
				I dare say."</p>
			<p>"But I must go back to this poor child; I have left her with an old lady, who will, I
				fear, be greatly alarmed at being left so long," said Mary.</p>
			<p>" <hi>Poor child!</hi> " repeated her limping guide, who, from the moment they had
				entered, had been reposing herself, by sitting on the floor, and had not spoken till
				now. " <hi>Poor child!</hi> — think of that! — and she comes from the factory! Think
				of speaking in that way of a factory child!"</p>
			<p>"Hold your tongue, Sally, or I'll give you no porridge for supper," said the woman,
				but by no means harshly; and as she spoke, she dropped into the maniac's lap a piece
				of bread that lay in a plate upon the table.</p>
			<p>"Had your factory child got this now," said poor Sally, nodding her head with a sort
				of boastful exultation, "she would not be so terrible bad. But there's nobody but me
				as gets this. I am the only old woman in the world; all the rest die young — and
				most of 'em," she added, in a whisper, "before they get away."</p>
			<p>"Was this poor creature at the Deep Valley factory when she was young?" demanded Miss
				Brotherton.</p>
			<p>"She tells you quite true, ma'am," replied the farmer's wife, resuming her cookery,
				which consisted in chopping up bacon, cabbage, and potatoes, for the frying-pan.
				"She talks nonsense about the moon sometimes, and is very wild when it comes to the
				full, but she never makes any blunder when she tells of her own troubles at the
				factory. She never varies the least bit in the world when she tells about her
				getting away, and being stopped, and taken back again, poor cretur. 'Tis only too
				true, that's the worst of it — and she has never been in her right mind since."</p>
			<p>"I would hear her tell it willingly, and should listen to it with great interest,"
				said Miss Brotherton. "But at this moment I can think of nothing but those I have
				left."</p>
			<p>"Whereabouts be they, ma'am?" demanded the farmer's wife.</p>
			<p> Mary described the spot very accurately. "Why, dear me! them surely must be the
				trees right against our gate," said the good woman, with great apparent
				satisfaction. "And if so be as I'm right, 'tis hardly more than a stone's throw from
				our back gate. I take it, <pb n="271"/> ma'am, as you walked by the lane just round
				our farm, and them trees as you speak of, bean't not one quarter of the distance as
				you have come." </p>
			<p>"In that case," replied Miss Brotherton, greatly comforted, "I have no doubt that we
				could get the poor little girl here, and then if you would give us leave to remain
				till your husband has contrived to procure some sort of conveyance for us, all our
				troubles would be over, and most gratefully will I repay you for your
				assistance."</p>
			<p>"I will show you the way this moment, ma'am," said the woman, with great alacrity;
				and once more suspending her labours for the good man's supper, she prepared to
				attend the lady by taking off an external apron, and smoothing that which was below
				it.</p>
			<p>Though not quite <hi>within a stone's throw</hi> , the spot to which Miss Brotherton
				was so anxious to return, was reached by a very short cut across the piece of
				meadow-ground on which the back part of the farm-house opened.</p>
			<p>The joy of Mrs. Tremlett at seeing her was great indeed; and poor Fanny, refreshed by
				the interval of rest, declared herself quite able to walk "a good piece more."</p>
			<p>"Poor little creature!" exclaimed good Mrs. Roberts, the farmer's wife; "she do look
				bad, sure enough! It is seldom or never that we gets a sight of the children at the
				mill, for they sends regular for what they wants, and bean't over fond of having any
				body go near 'em; — but she puts me strongly in mind of old Sally's stories to be
				sure!"</p>
			<p>The little party reached the farm without difficulty, and then, indeed, as Mary had
				predicted, all their present troubles seemed over, for nothing could exceed the
				earnest kindness with which Mrs. Roberts administered to all their wants. Mrs.
				Tremlett's appearance and manner appeared to have entirely removed the sort of
				doubtful impression which poor Mary's hurried <hi>entrée</hi> had produced, and
				having been told that the little girl had been reclaimed by them as a relation, the
				whole adventure appeared to her as one of the deepest interest, and her sympathy and
				good-will were most fully excited.</p>
			<p>Old Sally was sitting upon the floor exactly where they had left her. "Poor thing!"
				exclaimed Mary, "she has not moved an inch."</p>
			<p>"Not she, poor soul," replied Mrs. Roberts, "I told her to bide still, and when we
				says that to her, she'd keep still, if we was to be away a whole day, I believe. Get
				up, Sally!" she added, good-humouredly. "There's brave woman! Look at that little
				girl, and tell the ladies what she puts you in mind of."</p>
			<p>The expression of the poor withered, idiot face, that was turned upon Fanny Fletcher
				when this was uttered, was most touchingly sad and solemn. The gentle, silly look,
				which her countenance usually wore, was exchanged for one full of deep mysterious
				meaning. She drew herself towards the little girl with a sort of stealthy movement,
				as if afraid of being seen to approach her, and when quite close beside her,
				said,</p>
			<p> "You then have done as I did — you have run away? Poor, poor <pb n="272"/> little
				thing! Can't you guess what will come next? Poor little thing! They will catch you!
				hide where you will, they will catch you." </p>
			<p>"I have not run away," said Fanny, gently.</p>
			<p>The maniac shook her head. "Don't you scream as I did, my poor lamb, for it's no
				good; they care no more for screams and groans than for the whirring of the
				spindles. But the screams went into my own ears, and I have never got rid of them
				since. I still hear them, all night long, when it is moon-time. Poor, poor little
				girl!"</p>
			<p>"Come, come Sally — let her alone now, she is going to eat something."</p>
			<p>And Mrs. Roberts completed the arrangements upon which she had been occupied since
				they entered, by placing chairs at the table on which bread, butter, and cheese,
				were placed.</p>
			<p>Not even did the Deep-Valley apprentice feel more disposed to do justice to these
				preparations than did Miss Brotherton and her old servant. They had tasted nothing
				since breakfast, and when a bowl of fresh milk was added to the bread-and-butter,
				Mary gratefully assured her entertainer that she considered it as the most delicious
				supper she had ever eaten.</p>
			<p>"Now that's different," said poor Sally, who had perched herself on a low stool close
				to Fanny Fletcher. "I never had any pretty creature like that, all clothed in
				heavenly trappings, giving <hi>me</hi> milk; but it will make no difference in the
				end — you must be dragged back again, poor little thing!"</p>
			<p>"No, no — she won't be dragged back again," said Mrs. Roberts; "and there's a cup of
				milk for you — so now let the ladies eat in peace, Sally. You know it's time for you
				to be crawling home — the master will be here in no time, and maybe he will be after
				asking how many stones you have picked up to-day, so you had better be off."</p>
			<p>The docile creature immediately shuffled off her stool, and prepared to depart.</p>
			<p>"I should like to hear her describe her own adventures, which you say she does so
				faithfully," said Miss Brotherton. "Do you think you could persuade her to repeat
				her story to us?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, yes, ma'am; she will do that quick enough; it is just what she likes best,"
				replied Mrs. Roberts; "except now and then when she is moody. Now, Sally, if you
				will behave yourself like a sensible woman, you may sit down again, and tell the
				ladies how you ran away from the mill, and was caught and brought back again, and
				all the rest of it."</p>
			<p>The little cripple's eyes twinkled, and a gleam of intelligence flashed across her
				countenance with a sort of Will-o'-the-wisp brightness, as she took the fragment of
				a hat from her closely-shorn gray head, and reseated herself.</p>
			<p> "'Twas my knees as was the first of it," she began; "I couldn't bear it. The pain
				growed worse and worse, and my legs dipped down, and they strapped me harder and
				harder, and that was the reason that I couldn't bear it. So one day," she continued,
				in a deep <pb n="273"/> clear whisper, "one day when the 'prentices, and
				overlookers, and manager, and all was off for dinner, I stopped behind 'em, and
				nobody seed me — no, not one of 'em. And while they were at dinner, I slipped into
				the yard where the pigs bide, and then away again, all upon the sly, to the door
				where they takes the dirt out. I thought maybe, I might have the bolts to pull, but
				not a bit of it — there it stood wide open, with a barrow full of rubbish between
				the posts — that was fun!" </p>
			<p>And here the poor creature laughed that dreadful laugh which none but maniacs
				utter.</p>
			<p>"But the fun lasted longer than that," she went on, "it lasted while I creeped along
				for a mile or more among the bushes as grows so rank t'other side the mill; and
				there I laid down at last in the midst of 'em, 'cause I heard a noise, and what d'ye
				think it was? What d'ye think the poor cretur heard with her heart galloping just at
				the bottom of her throat, for all the world like the flap — flap — flap of a
				fly-wheel?"</p>
			<p>"Perhaps 'twas a dog barking, Sally," said Mrs. Roberts, humouring the maniac as she
				made a pause.</p>
			<p>"No! 'twas not a dog barking, nor it wasn't a wolf, nor it wasn't a tiger; but it was
				something ten million of times worser than either — It — was — the —
				'printice-master!" replied Sally, in a slow deep whisper. "It was the divilish
				'printice-master with his eyes of fire, and his breath of flame. Oh-h! I feel him at
				my throat now!" and she clasped her withered neck with her pale thin hands,
				shuddering violently from head to foot.</p>
			<p>"Speak soberly, Sally, and like a sensible body, or you must not go on, you know
				that," said Mrs. Roberts, interposing in a warning tone, which poor Sally seemed to
				understand, for though her breast still heaved with a panting movement, like one who
				had run a race, and was out of breath, she assumed an affected air of composure,
				putting her hands before her primly, and shutting her eyes.</p>
			<p>"Yes, mississ, I know that," she replied, sedately, "I know that very well, and we
				won't trouble Joe ploughman to help us home this time; but I may go on, if I speak
				sensible, and like a wise woman, as I am?"</p>
			<p>The farmer's wife nodded assent, and Sally continued more quietly.</p>
			<p> "It was the 'printice-master, and none but he as dragged me forth, head foremost,
				out of the bushes — very much like the butcher, you know, my dears, when he takes
				the little lamb's head between his two hard hands — I never sees that up at Tom
				Blake's shambles, without thinking of it. So he dragged me back again — and then you
				may guess how the strap went! But think of me! think what a spirit I must have had
				in those days, my dears — will you believe that I made up my mind to start again,
				though I hadn't a bit of unbruised skin upon my body? — I did though. Oh, dear! oh,
				dear! how I used to hear the birds singing in my ears o'nights, when I laid down,
				and made believe to sleep! But I don't fancy it was sleep, not right <pb n="274"/>
				wholesome sleep ever, as I got then; for I can mind now, yes I can, with all my
				moonshine, I can mind now, how I used to smell the grass, and see the dew shining,
				and hear the pretty sweet cows a mooing, and I all the while shut up in a stone
				prison-house — that was the divil tempting me, wasn't it? But I didn't start again
				for two whole years though, — 'cause why, I never found no chance for it; and by
				that time my legs was shocking bad, and if it <hi>was</hi> the divil as made me run,
				he ought to have sent me a stick to help me — for, oh, dear! I crawled dreadful slow
				— and then — " </p>
			<p>"Come, come, Sally," interrupted Mrs. Roberts, "I won't have all that at full length,
				or else we shall have you off again; make an end, there's a fine woman. Tell the
				ladies about the shutting up, and then go home and to bed, for 'tis time."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton ceased to wonder, as she had first done, at the chartered licence
				which the crazy cripple seemed to enjoy, when she observed the perfect docility with
				which she obeyed every word and look of the farmer's wife. She now resumed her
				story, exactly at the word commanded.</p>
			<p>"Yes I was shut up, my dears — I shall have soon done now, for I am coming to the
				black gap, as I call it, and I always stops there — but where do you think they shut
				me up? In this room, or that room, or t'other room, perhaps? Not a bit of it. They
				shut me up in a little narrow place, not much bigger than a grave, and it was dark —
				dark — dark, all but one little narrow slip, and there was no light comed through
				that at first; but by and by, after I had been days and days locked in, I heard a
				horrid, horrid lumbering noise, and then I saw a flash of light through the narrow
				slip, for all the world like the light of a candle — and the light of a candle it
				was too, and what do you think it showed me? Crippled as I was, I managed to
				scramble high enough to peep — there was beams, on bricks or something, and what do
				you think I saw?"</p>
			<p>The poor creature began shaking again, but on Mrs. Roberts holding up her finger, she
				seemed to make a strong effort to control herself, and once more slipping off her
				stool she drew close to Miss Brotherton, and in a low rapid voice, hurried through
				the remainder of her narrative.</p>
			<p>"I saw," said she, "the master's wife laid stone dead upon a truckle-bed, amost as
				close to me as I to you — think of that! Stone dead! Stiffened, stark, and ghastly,
				and blue! There was a candle that flaed full upon her dead face; but they as brought
				her was run away — they couldn't bear it, I'm sure they couldn't bear it, and I was
				left alone to look upon it, and I couldn't run away; but I could not bear it either!
				and then it was that I screamed — hush! I must not scream now, you know!"</p>
			<p>Here she stopped, putting her hands before her eyes, and remaining perfectly still
				for a minute, and then added with more composure,</p>
			<p> "After that came the black gap, and I don't know any thing more about it; only that
				I watch the sun go to bed every night, and I have been going on praying for years
				and years, all the time I have been <pb n="275"/> growing into an old woman, that he
				would please not to wake me in the morning." </p>
			<p>"Here's the master, Sally!" said Mrs. Roberts; "so take yourself off, there's a good
				woman. Here's your mug of porridge; put on your hat steady, and wish the ladies a
				good night."</p>
			<p>Again she was most docilely obeyed, and in another moment poor Sally was gone, and
				the hardworking master of the premises occupied her place. The situation and wants
				of his unexpected guests were speedily explained to him, and his best assistance as
				speedly promised. While he devoured a hasty supper, one of his farm-horses was put
				into the shafts of a jockey-cart, and in less than an hour after his return, the
				comforted party set out by the light of a friendly moon, and were safely jolted to
				the King's Head, without having been overtaken by the treacherous miller, who
				probably preferred sharing the jovial supper, in which his good friend Woodcomb
				indulged on this memorable evening, to forsaking it for the purpose of overtaking
				the ladies, from whom it was derived — as there seemed but little chance of drawing
				any thing more from the same source.</p>
			<p>Great was the joy of Mrs. Prescot at seeing her guests return; for their long
				absence, together with the nature of the business on which they were engaged had
				caused the good woman to torment herself with many dark forebodings. Nevertheless,
				she was well prepared to receive them, and nothing was wanting that she could
				furnish towards refreshing the adventurers after their fatigue.</p>
			<p>But, alas! it was only then; it was only after the anxiety, and the agitation of the
				enterprise were over, that poor Mary fully remembered how abortive that enterprise
				had been; and then she wept, wept bitterly, as she thought of the load of anguish
				she had to carry home to Michael's mother and brother. Yet as she listened to little
				Fanny's tearful narration of all that had passed between them, during the weeks the
				had worked together, she felt that when the first dreadful pang should be over,
				there would be something like consolation for them in listening to it also; and as
				she studied the delicate and expressive features of the pretty creature she had
				rescued, and watched the sort of timid, doubting hope, that by degrees took place of
				the nervous, heart-struck look, that had been so painfully legible in her sweet face
				when first she saw her, it was impossible not to feel that while deploring the loss
				of one object of benevolence, she had to rejoice for having found another.</p>
			<p>Luckily for the respectability of their appearance, in setting forth on their
				homeward travels the following morning, the active Mrs. prescot was enabled, by the
				aid of the heiress's magic pocket-book, to procure from a neighbour a suit of decent
				apparel for the little orphan. The same freely-flowing source supplied wherewithal
				to reward all the friendly offices performed by the host and hostess of the Kings's
				Head, and in addition, they were left in possession of a romance which was likely
				enough, from the frequency with which it was repeated, to furnish a legend to the
				little village to the end of time.</p>
			<p> One single adventure occurred to Miss Brotherton on her way home, <pb n="276"/>
				which though forming a very isolated episode in the history of her journey, shall be
				recounted, because the fact which it brought to her knowledge is one that well
				deserves publicity. </p>
			<p>The heiress varied her road homewards, by driving through a village which, were it
				not infested by the plague-spot of a factory, might be considered as one of the most
				attractive in Derbyshire. At one point the road passes through a rocky defile of
				such wild beauty, that Mary, who was equally unacquainted with fine scenery, and
				capable of enjoying it, called to the postboy to stop, that she might get out and
				walk up the long ascent, in order the more thoroughly to enjoy the widely-spreading
				landscape it commanded. Neither of her companions accompanied her. Mrs. Tremlett
				consenting, nothing loth, to to remain in the post-chaise, upon the steepness of the
				road being pointed to her, while little Fanny, though in her heart longing to spring
				after her benefactress, replied to the observation, that she was not yet strong
				enough to climb, by a look that spoke more of gratitude, than regret.</p>
			<p>It was alone, therefore, that Mary Brotherton started forward, her active steps soon
				leaving the carriage behind; when cutting short the spiral ascent by making her way
				through the underwood which clothed the bank, she soon found herself high above the
				road, and on spot of great beauty. After lingering here for a few minutes she
				proceeded. when hearing the ever attractive sound of rushing waters, she again
				stopped, and then, guided by her ear, followed where it led, till she reached an
				opening, not far from the high-road, but apart from it, where, instead of the
				mountain cascade she had expected, a spectacle greeted her that for an instant
				seemed to petrify every nerve, and the bounding elastic movement which had brought
				her within sight of it, was changed to the rigid stillness of Marble. A man, almost
				ferocious in his aspect, from the squalid, unshorn, brutal negligence of decency
				which it betrayed, was supporting in his arms, and on his of of ten or eleven years
				old, whose ghastly countenance showed plainly that death was busy at his heart.
				Before the rock from whence flowed the gushing stream, whose sound had brought Miss
				Brotherton to the spot, stood what looked like the fragment of a rude pillar, and on
				this stone the father had rested the wasted from of his dying child. Before him
				stood a little girl gazing on the boy with a mixture of infant fear a sisterly love,
				as she tended a bowl, filled from the spring, to his lips.</p>
			<p>"He is very ill!" said Mary, addressing the father, "can I go any where to get help
				for you?"</p>
			<p>The man, who had the fragment of a pipe in his mouth, and who looked rather
				bewildered, and fiercely angry, than oppressed by sorrow, stared at her, but
				answered not a word.</p>
			<p>"What is the matter with him?" said Miss Brotherton, addressing the little girl.</p>
			<p> "He be worked down," replied the child, sobbing. "We have been at long hours for
				four weeks, and Dick couldn't stand it — father have carried him to and from mill
				for a week — but he couldn't stand <pb n="277"/> it. Mother said, when we started,
				that he looked as if he'd never come back alive; but he'd have had to pay double
				fine if so be as father had left him to bide at home, so he carried him to mill; but
				though they strapped him, and strapped him, he couldn't stand to his work. and he
				have been lying in the mill-yard till father comed to take him." </p>
			<p>This horrible statement was uttered amidst tears and sobs, but poor Mary lost not a
				word of it; and as her very soul sickened at the tale, she felt tempted to believe
				that she was doomed to witness every circumstance that could most painfully recall
				the source whence all her greatness flowed.</p>
			<p>With clasped hands, and streaming eyes, she stood silently watching the gasping
				breath of this young victim of unnatural labour. The boy's eyes fixed themselves on
				the face of his little sister. He might be listening to her history of his early
				fate — or he might be consciously taking a last look at what he loved. In either
				case the effort demanded more strength than was left him — his eyes closed, a
				shivering movement passed through all his frame, and then he became still. The
				quick, short, unequal heaving of the breast was seen no more, and Mary hid her eyes
				as the mysterious change, which no human being can gaze upon unmoved, come upon the
				stiffening features. It was rather instinct than feeling, which prompted her even at
				that awful moment to proffer what she had learned to know would be felt as
				consolation, did one starving member of a family alone survive amidst the dying and
				the dead of a whole race. Without venturing again to look at the father and his son
				she dropped into the bowl, which the little girl still held, what she hated to think
				would soon turn natural sorrow into unnatural forgetfulness of it: but she had no
				power to serve them more effectually, and hastily turning into the road, she awaited
				the slow arrival of the post-chaise in a state of mind which left no faculty at
				leisure to enjoy and longer the hills and valleys for whose sake she had left
				it.</p>
			<p>From this time the journey homeward proceeded without accident or adventure of any
				kind, and Mary would probably have shared the pleasure so energetically expressed by
				Mr. Tremlett at being restored to the luxurious tranquillity of Milford Park, had
				not the heavy news she carried to the poor Armstrongs made her dread the day that
				would follow her reaching it.</p>
			<p>But how she got through that painful day, and all that resulted from it — how little
				Fanny Fletcher fared in her new and most strange home, and whether her patroness had
				most reason to bless or deplore the sudden movement which had caused her to hazard
				the blending thus the destiny of one so utterly unknown, with her own must all be
				reserved for future narration, as the adventures of Michael Armstrong, of necessity,
				draw the pen of his historian elsewhere.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XXV. </head>
			<p>THE NARRATIVE RETURNS TO ITS HERO — AND RELATES WHY AND WHEREFORE HE WAS KEPT ALIVE —
				THE BOY GROWS TALL, AND TAKES TO THINKING.</p>
			<p>
				The answer which Fanny Fletcher had received to her inquiries
				concerning Michael was as false as it was heedless. The little fellow who gave it
				had no intention of uttering what was untrue: he believed that the boy she inquired
				for was dead — so many had died and been borne from the wretched garret where he had
				himself lain, battling with the fever, sometimes delirious, and sometimes asleep,
				that it was no great wonder he should blunder. But Michael Armstrong was not dead,
				though the state in which the malady left him was such, that for weeks the surly old
				woman, hired to supply the place of Mrs Poulet, muttered curses on him for not being
				in a state to be quietly buried out of the way, like the rest.</p>
			<p>It was just five days after Fanny Fletcher left the Deep Valley Mills in company with
				Miss Brotherton, that Michael waked from that first sound healing sleep, which often
				announces the conquest of life over death, after a hard-fought struggle between
				them.</p>
			<p>The little fellow raised himself upright on his straw pallet, and for a minute or two
				looked about him to make himself quite sure where he was; for so heavy had been his
				sleep that it was not immediately his senses could recover their usual powers of
				perception. But only too soon, alas! he made it all out. He was still in that foul
				den of misery and filth; and the first impulse of his fully-recovered intellect was
				to utter a bitter expression of regret that his life had been spared for further
				suffering, while so many had been mercifully permitted to sink into their peaceful
				graves. But even as he breathed the words, he repented of them. The image of his
				mother seemed to rise before him — he remembered that she had bade him ever to trust
				in God, and let no cause tempt him to take his name in vain. The quiet eye of his
				much-enduring brother rose to his memory, as he had seen it a thousand times fixed
				upon him, while he enjoined patience and submission for their dear mother's sake;
				and the more recently heard precepts of little Fanny, all preaching the same
				righteous, but hard lesson, came in their soft pleading, innocent tone to give him
				strength to bear. Michael crossed his emaciated hands upon his breast, and murmured
				"God forgive me!" — then dropping again into a gentle sleep, awoke not, till the old
				woman shook him rudely, rather for the gratification of her curiosity, than in
				performance of her duty, in order to see whether the "wiry, hard-skinned little
				varment wasn't dead at last."</p>
			<p> She started with a feeling very like terror, when the boy opening <pb n="279"/> his
				large eyes upon her, asked her to please to be so kind as to give him a drink of
				water. </p>
			<p>"What, then! — you don't mean to die after all? If you bean't born to be hanged, it's
				a mystery. Water? — if you haven't got summut in it after lying this fashion, the
				Lord knows how long, you'll balk the hangman at last!" And with these words the
				crabbed crone retreated, hastening, with the consciousness of having something
				wonderful to tell, into the presence of Mr. Woodcomb.</p>
			<p>"There's a boy, sir, as have been lying a dying amost ever since I comed, as is
				actually coming to, now; not but what he must still be within an inch of the grave,
				seeing what he has gone through — and he looks for all the world as if he had been
				buried and dug up again. Howsomever I don't think but what he might come through, if
				so be as I you thought it worth while to give him food. That sort of sleep as I
				waked him out of, shows plain enough as the fever is gone, and then you know, sir,
				as kitchen physic is all the cretur's wants, perhaps, for the sake of preventing the
				burying beginning again, your honour might think it was as well to give him a little
				broth, and meat, too, after a bit, for he won't do without it, that's certain."</p>
			<p>"I had clean forgot that there was one left up there, Molly," replied the
				superintendent. "But in Heaven's name, let him be fed, woman — I wouldn't have to
				bury any more of 'em just now, for ever so — he'll come round again, I suppose
				before its very long? We are still very short of piecers, and it's as well to keep
				him alive, you know, as to go after another."</p>
			<p>"As for that, sir," replied the old woman, "it won't be to-morrow, nor next day,
				either, as he'll pay for his salt; I'll tell you that beforehand. So you had best
				please to make up your mind at once about the keeping him alive. There's nothing
				will do it but giving him amost a bellyful every day, and maybe a little fresh air
				into the bargain, I'm thinking, seeing the time he's laid stewing up there, with
				such lots dying all round him."</p>
			<p>"If it wasn't for the having to open ground for him again, I'd be hanged, drawn and
				quartered, before I'd trouble myself about what sort of air a 'prentice had to
				breath. Howsomever, I have got my own reasons for not choosing to trouble the parson
				again, nor yet for doing the job without him. So cram the brat as much a you like —
				I suppose my leavings is good enough for him?"</p>
			<p>"Please master not to talk for my liking to cram 'prentice brats," retorted Molly.
				"Often and often, as I've been back and forward here, for one job or another, nobody
				ever saw me trying to pilfer any thing for their starving stomachs, the low creturs!
				I dispises 'em too much. But I knows what will save life, and what will lose it,
				better, maybe, than most folks, and so now you may do just as you please, without
				putting it upon my likes or dislikes."</p>
			<p> "Don't be so frumpish, Molly Bing," replied Mr. Woodcomb, laughing, "there's nobody
				going to charge you with being such a fool as to make a pet of a factory 'prentice
				while there's a puppy-dog to be had for love or money. Don't you be scared at any
				such notion as that, <pb n="280"/> for I knows ye a deal better, old woman, than to
				put any such affront upon ye. You just stop the creature from dying, if you can for
				that will suit me a deal best just now." </p>
			<p>The will of Mr. Woodcomb, thus clearly expressed, was acted upon with very implicit
				obedience; the consequence of which was, that Michael Armstrong was not only saved
				from death, put his constitution greatly benefited. Molly Bing had pledged her
				judgment upon the result of his case, and in order to prove it correct, she
				contrived that he should swallow about ten times as much nourishment as fell to the
				share of any other child in the mill. He had grown surprisingly during the period of
				his confinement, and this gave so lengthy a look to his thin person, that Molly more
				than once fancied the audacious little villain would give her the lie at last; so
				she not only fed him, but got leave for him to clean out the pig-sties, scrape up
				the filth from the yard, and sundry other jobs of the same description all which,
				however unsavoury in their nature, bore, as the sharp-witted old woman well knew,
				the balm of health in every movement they enforced, compared to the monotonous and
				grinding slavery of the mill. But in the course of a month or two, another glorious
				proof of England's prosperity reached the Deep Valley, in the shape of a large
				order, and Mr. Elgood Sharpton in communicating the cheering intelligence to his
				manager, enforced the necessity of strenuous exertion in the execution of it, by
				telling him that, sick or well, the children must work long hours, and that it was
				far better that they should a <hi>little</hi> overwork the hands, than run any risk
				of disappointing so valuable a customer.</p>
			<p>In consequence of these instructions, Michael was withdrawn from his out-door
				labours, and once more made to follow the mules. It was then, and then only that he
				discovered the heavy loss he had sustained by the departure of Fanny. While employed
				upon the outof-door tasks assigned to him by the commands of Molly Bings, he had
				been strictly enjoined never to speak to any of the apprentices who might chance to
				pass while he was at work. His meals were eaten in Mr. Woodcomb's kitchen, and the
				place assigned for his lodging by night, was a sort of closet that opened from it.
				No day, no hour had passed, unless in sleep, since he recovered his senses, without
				his thinking of her. At the risk, or rather with the certainty of cuffs and hards
				words, no foot-fall had ever passed within his hearing without causing him to turn
				his head to reconnoitre, and much as he preferred the labour on which he was now
				employed to that of the mill, he would willingly, nay joyfully, have exchanged it in
				the hope of again seeing his little friend. It was therefore with a feeling of
				gladness, instead of regret, that he received orders to turn into the factory.</p>
			<p>"That is queer!" thought the little fellow, as he bounded to obey the command, with
				the double energy of recovered health, and awakened hope, "it is queer for me to
				feel glad that I am going back to the factory!"</p>
			<p> As it happened, he was marshalled into the same room in which he <pb n="281"/> had
				worked before his illness — but alas! when he turned his eyes to the spot which
				Fanny had formerly occupied near him, a singularly ill-favoured boy met his gaze,
				instead of the pretty creature he sought for. This was a death-blow to the joy which
				a few minutes before had given him a gait and an expression of countenance so
				unwonted in a factory-boy returning to his well-known sufferings. Nevertheless,
				though a tear blinded the eyes which at length settled reluctantly on the broken
				threads which awaited his fingers, he remembered that the factory had seven floors,
				and cruel as it was to lose the pleasure of giving his little friend a look or a
				word as they each paced their weary walk, he still thought he might get a sight of
				her at their dismal meals, and fancied that he should not greatly regret exchanging
				scraps of wholesome meat, for musty oatmeal, provided Fanny Fletcher was by to tell
				him not to mind it. But the musty oatmeal came all too soon, for no word or look of
				Fanny's came with it; nor did any uncertainty long remain, on which to hang a
				lingering hope that some unfinished task detained her in the mill, and that he
				should see her soon. His first question, whispered to the girl who sat beside him,
				brought forth the history of Fanny's wonderful departure, at as full length as the
				time and place would permit. At first he listened to it with incredulity. It seemed,
				he thought, like a story made up to deceive him for fun; and little as the blighted
				young spirits of that sad fraternity were given to jesting, Michael clung to the
				belief that such was the case, as long as the meal lasted. But, as usual, a few
				minutes followed, during which they were left alone — an indulgence which
				necessarily arose from the fact, that even the niggardly allowance of time awarded
				by the regulations of Mr. Elgood Sharpton for their meals, was more than the
				famished children required for devouring the the scanty portion set before them. No
				sooner had Mr. Poulet withdrawn himself, after witnessing the orderly consumption by
				each, of the allotted morsel, than such of the miserable crew as had survived the
				pestilence, and remembered the close alliance between Michael and the heroine of the
				marvellous tale which was still in every mouth, all rushed together towards him for
				the purpose of recounting it. Notwithstanding the confusion of tongues, their noisy
				testimony was too consistent to admit of doubt, and Michael remained with the
				astounding belief that his little friend was taken away to be made a great lady of. </p>
			<p> The heart of Michael Armstrong proved itself to be a very generous one on this
				occasion. "Some natural tears he shed, but wiped them soon." as he remembered that
				the more miserable the situation in which he was left, the more he ought to rejoice
				that Fanny had been taken from it. And he did rejoice; truly, sincerely, and at the
				very bottom of his heart did he rejoice. As day after day the hateful routine of
				unvarying suffering again laid its grasp upon his existence, with a power as
				irresistible as that of the vast engine which within those prison-walls <pb n="282"/> seemed "lord of all," the generous heart of Michael felt thankful that Fanny
				Fletcher shared in it no longer. It had been quite in vain that he had laboured to
				persuade himself, while listening to the reasonings of his little friend, that they
				ought mutually to rejoice in the probability of each other's death. Though he had
				allowed that as far as he was himself concerned he might easily be brought to think
				that it would be a comfort to die, he could never reach the pitch of sublimity
				necessary to form the wish that Fanny might die before him. But now it was evident
				that this weakness, which had more than once caused his little monitress to shake
				her head and say that he did not love her as well as she loved him, it was now quite
				evident that it was no selfish motive which had caused it. </p>
			<p>By degrees this truly noble feeling, this generous power of living, as it were, in
				the prosperity of another, so strengthened the character of the boy, as perfectly to
				save him from that worst result of youthful suffering, a reckless, desperate
				despair, which by destroying hope, that beautiful mainspring of all our best
				actions, leaves the poor spiritless machine alive only to wretched consciousness of
				its capacity for pain. It is, beyond all question, this bitter hopelessness which
				deteriorates in so remarkable a manner the moral character of operatives under the
				present factory system. In no other situation, excepting only that of slaves
				purchased and paid for like an ox, or an ass, is the destiny of a human being placed
				so wholly and completely beyond the reach of his own control. He is, as Wordsworth
				truly says, "A slave to whom release comes not, And cannot come." </p>
			<p>In no other situation do labouring men, women, and children feel and know that unless
				they submit in all things to the behests of their employer, they must die — and that
				too by a process ten thousand times worse then either the hangman's cord, or the
				headsman's axe — they must die the death of famine. If their lingering hours of
				labour be prolonged beyond the stipulated time for which they are paid, they cannot
				turn and say, "I will not, for it is not in the bond" for the ready answer is, "
					<hi>Go</hi> . We employ none who make conditions with us." And where are they to
				go? To the parish officers? As ready an answer meets them there: " <hi>Go</hi> . We
				relieve none who can get work, and refuse it." If they are fined, however unjustly,
				however arbitrarily, if the iniquitous <hi>truck</hi> system be resorted to for
				payment of of wages, instead of money, if their women be insulted, or their children
				crippled, and remonstrance follow, the same death-dooming reply awaits them: "
					<hi>Go</hi> . We employ no grumblers here."</p>
			<p> Then to what quarter can they look with hope? Where are they to find that only
				elixir by which human strength is mercifully made for ever equal to sustain human
				suffering? The sparkling draught is not for them! The factory operative alone of all
				to whom God has given the power of thought, is denied the delicious privilege of
				hope. It is this which degrades their nature; it is this which from youth to age <pb n="283"/> renders one ruinous hour of brutal debauchery more precious, than all
				that steadfast sober industry can promise or bestow. </p>
			<p>It was long, very long, ere this intellectual blight, this smothering mildew of the
				soul fell upon Michael, for he seemed to possess a sort of twofold existance, "the
				worser half of it," being his poor self, while the better was found in the happy
				destiny of Fanny. Countless were the miles that he walked backwards and forwards
				hefore the mules, during which he cheered his fancy by painting her in the midst of
				liberty and green fields. Sometimes he thought that if she were rich, she would
				remember all he had told her about his mother and Edward — that she would find them
				out — would take compassion on their poverty — would talk of him — would sooth and
				comfort them.</p>
			<p>All this may seem, to happier beings, but a frail support, under incessant labour,
				accompanied by every species of privation, yet it did Michael service — it kept his
				faculties alive; for it gave a theme, and a pleasant one, on which to fix his
				thoughts, and half the the tedium of his own sad life was forgotten, as he meditated
				on the probable happiness of hers.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, it must be owned, — though he always told himself that such thoughts were
				nonsense, — ideas would suggest themselves less abstractedly disinterested; for it
				would now and then come into his head, that Fanny Fletcher knew where Sir Matthew
				had sent him, if nobody else did; and that, perhaps, if she grew to be a great girl,
				with power to do what she liked, she might think of him, and try to do something to
				rescue him. Vague as was this notion, vague as he himself felt it to be, it was a
				blessing to him. When such thoughts arose, his bodily strength seemed to revive, his
				aching knees no longer bent under him, his gait was no longer that of an ordinary
				factory-child, the energy of his mind lent itself to his limbs, and wearily as he
				stretched himself upon his bed of straw, and long and lanky as his half-starved
				person grew, Michael Armstrong did not become a cripple.</p>
			<p>But years wore away, and the stout-hearted young prisoner of the Deep Valley began
				again to think that he had better have died of the fever, than have lived so long,
				hoping for some happy chance to set him free, and hoping for ever and for ever in
				vain.</p>
			<p>"I am a fool," argued Michael at fourteen, — "I am a fool for thinking so very much
				of one who it is quite plain has never thought of me — nor of mother — nor of my
				poor Edward either; she never gave a thought to either of us! I was a fool to dream
				it! The fine folks that carried her away, took her far enough from sight and sound
				of factory-people. And who can blame her if she never turned her head back again to
				inquire about any of them? Poor little Fanny! She was very kind to me once — and she
				was the very prettiest little girl that ever I happened to see. But other people may
				have found that out by this time, as well as I. Fanny Fletcher is a whole year older
				than me! I will try with all my might and main never to think of her any more!"</p>
			<pb n="284"/>
			<p>This resolution was not very steadily adhered to; but the struggle to do it, which
				was perfectly sincere, made the poor boy moody, and more miserable than ever. His
				dreams perpetually represented to him his mother and helpless brother, suffering
				from some unkindness from Fanny, whom he saw superlatively beautiful, and
				superlatively rich, but more superlatively hard-hearted still. These nervous and
				irritating visitations brought his mother and brother so vividly before him, that
				for weeks he could never, whether waking or sleeping, get them out of his head. He
				fancied himself again running at full speed from Dowling Lodge, with Martha's basket
				on his arm; his mother's little room, decent and orderly in spite of poverty, came
				back upon his mind as if he had left it but yesterday. He saw the soft expression of
				her faded countenance, and felt the welcome of her fond embrace.</p>
			<p>"Oh, fool! oh, proud and wicked fool!" he murmured to his tear-stained pillow, as
				these, and a thousand other tender recollections pressed upon him. "Why could I not
				endure the tyrant's cruelty? I might have kissed her now! I might have comforted
				poor Teddy!" The sound of his own voice as he pronounced this dear familiar name,
				though in a whisper too low to awaken the weary sleepers round him, wrung his very
				heart by the vivid recollections which it brought, and though he was now beyond
				fourteen years old, he cried himself to sleep.</p>
			<p>Fitful and feverish were the transitions of his mind at this period. Sometimes he
				persuaded himself that his mother was no more, that the loss of him had broken her
				heart, and that she had died, believing him to have gone before her. At other times
				it was Edward whom he wept as dead. His shattered health, his feeble limbs were, as
				he thought, sure evidence that nature meant him not to struggle long against the
				misery of his lot, and there were moments in which this persuasion even soothed
				him.</p>
			<p>"Sweet fellow!" thought he. "How calm and beautiful he must have looked in death!
				Even in suffering, even in agony, his countenance was lovely — so patient, and so
				heavenly mild! Better, far better he should die, than live a factory-boy like
				me!"</p>
			<p>And then again his mood would change, and he had for ever before him images of the
				most fearful destitution — his mother starving, and Edward slowly perishing beside
				her, because <hi>he</hi> had been too proud and too impatient to endure sundry
				buffetings and other indignities, which, when put in competition with the thought of
				having injured them, dwindled into petty injuries, which he deserved eternal shame
				for shrinking from.</p>
			<p>Dreadful were the hours he thus spent! and, fearful to think of, was the hopeless,
				helpless, joyless, comfortless existence by which he held to earth! His very soul
				sickened as he looked around him, and read in every withered melancholy face the
				history of blasted youth, and the prophecy of premature death.</p>
			<p> But there are spirits which sorrow and suffering cannot quench, and Michael
				Armstrong's was one of them. Nature and accident together <pb n="285"/> had been
				stronger than the tendency of his employment to cripple his limbs, and he was
				neither deformed nor stunted. This happy exemption from the common lot, was
				doubtless greatly owing to the pertinacity of Molly Bing, in proving to Messrs.
				Woodcomb and Poulet that she was no fool, and knew well enough what she was about.
				This steadfastness on her part, acting in unison with the superintendent's judicious
				objections to Michael's being buried at that particular time, had certainly given a
				very critical and efficient impulse to the vigour of a frame of great natural
				strength and comeliness. The energetic self-sustaining soul within it, had also much
				to do in defying the paralyzing influence of his miserable situation. It was rarely
				that Michael could be seen to drag his limbs along, even in the last hours of
				long-protracted labour, with the same crippled, dipping gait as his companions. A
				broken-spirited child, when his knees are aching, permits them to bend under him;
				and not one in fifty, perhaps, of the half-starved, over-worked apprentices of the
				Deep Valley, reached the term of their captivity, without carrying away with them
				some species of bodily weakness or deformity. But let the reason be what it might,
				Michael was saved from this, and though exhibiting a fabric, composed of little
				besides skin, bone, and sinew, he was, at the age of fourteen years and six months,
				both tall and straight. </p>
			<p>But it seemed as if the inward strength of mental suffering kept pace with this
				vigour of frame; for day by day the bitter consciousness of his own wretched and
				degraded state increased upon him — and day by day his swelling heart grew more
				indignant as he looked around him, and watched the exercise of lawless power and
				coward tyranny upon his miserable companions.</p>
			<p>It was after a peculiarly hateful display of this power, by an act of insult too
				disgustiug to relate, upon the unresisting person of a little fellow who seemed
				crawling (only too slowly!) to the grave, that Michael, when every other sufferer in
				the chamber was fast asleep, set himself to meditate gravely and deliberately upon
				his own situation. He had that day been so near trying the power of his bony arms,
				by flying at the throat of the ruffian who had so revoltingly outraged his
				companion, that with more than boyish judgment he became conscious of the growing
				danger that beset him. Though he had felt almost to suffocation the boiling rage
				which nothing but injustice, and the pitiful abuse of adventitious power can
				generate, he was not such a Quixote as to hope that his arm could effectually
				redress the wrongs he witnessed, yet he thought with a sort of trembling exultation,
				that if, he <hi>had</hi> seized the craven overlooker, as he kicked from him the
				helpless object of his tyranny, he might have held him with a grasp that would have
				stopped his breath for ever!</p>
			<p>It was a horrid and a murderous thought! and poor Michael, once the gentlest, fondest
				little heart, that ever nestled to a mother's bosom, did penance for it by a pang of
				self-condemnation, that made him grind his teeth in agony. Yet even then the goaded
				spirit seemed to rise in rebellion against its own remorse.</p>
			<p> "I cannot bear it!" he exclaimed in smothered accents, as he <pb n="286"/> turned
				his face towards his bed of straw. "I know I cannot bear it long! I have seen two
				attempting to escape, who have been brought back to frightful tortures — to I know
				not what! A solitary cell? the whip? the knotted thong? What matters? Would they
				could slaughter me at once! All would be over then." </p>
			<p>For a long still hour of that feverish night, the boy lay sleepless. A terrible
				conviction that there was something within him which might prove stronger than
				himself — stronger than all his mother's precepts, and the holy fear of God which
				they had left upon his mind — made him feel sick with horror, and shudder in
				abhorrence of his own wickedness. He prayed to God to give him power to turn his
				thoughts from this; and soothed to calmness by the healing act, he meditated without
				passion, and with great acuteness for his years, upon the probable result of
				attempting to escape.</p>
			<p>The difficulties of the enterprise were greater than any can imagine who know not the
				locality, and the intricate network of security which surround the imprisoned
				apprentices of Deep Valley on all sides. Of this the elder children, and the few who
				lived to approach their majority, were by no means ignorant. Considerable pains were
				indeed taken to impress upon their minds the certainty of their being caught if they
				succeeded in clearing the walls; together with the important fact that, as
				apprentices, it was illegal to assist them in running away from their master, and
				that it was the duty of every justice of peace to assist in securing and sending
				them back to complete the term fixed in their indentures.</p>
			<p>All this Michael knew perfectly well; neither was he at all sanguine in his hope of
				avoiding the toils from which he had never heard that any had escaped. Yet he
				determined to make the attempt, assuring himself, that no change in the treatment he
				received could render him more miserable, and sincerely thinking that it would be
				better and safer for him, should the failure of this desperate attempt lead to such
				a degree of restraint as would render the yielding to such violence of emotion, as
				had that day seized upon him, impossible.</p>
			<p>Having come to this conclusion, and firmly pledged his young spirit to the attempt,
				his feverish restlessness subsided, and he dropped asleep.</p>
			<p> The waking of the next morning was unlike any he had ever known before. He no longer
				felt as one among a miserable crew, sharing in common with them starvation, labour,
				and indignity; he felt himself to be one alone, and apart from all. He was on the
				eve of doing that which would involve him in difficulties and dangers altogether new
				and strange to him, and the only termination he could be really said to expect was
				the being dragged back to his prison to suffer all that it was in the power of his
				tyrants to inflict. These were strange materials for meditation which was decidedly
				agreeable; yet such Michael felt it to be, in spite of reason. A sensation of
				active, dauntless courage swelled his breast, which, with all the danger it
				threatened, was well worth the heavy monotony of his ordinary existence. At times,
				too, a gleam of hope would dart across the stern and steady gloom of <pb n="287"/>
				the prospect; and during the moment that the flash lasted, he saw himself restored
				to his mother and Edward. He could hardly be said to hope this, yet the feeling that
				it was possible sufficed to sustain his spirits through the days and nights which
				preceded the attempt. </p>
			<p>It was exactly by the same exit that poor crazy Sally had made use of some fifty
				years before, that Michael determined to leave the premises. The month or two during
				which he had been employed in cleaning the yard and its appurtenances, had made him
				thoroughly well acquainted with the outward door, and also with the region
				immediately beyond it, for it was thither that he was accustomed to convey all the
				rubbish which it was his office to remove — an office which might have been attended
				with some danger of the escape of him who performed it, had not those in authority
				taken care to inform him that no celerity of step could avail against the
				watchfulness of certain eyes about the factory, which were always on the alert to
				reconnoitre that door, and never far distant from the commodious windows which gave
				them power to do so.</p>
			<p>Poor Sally had found this but too surely in making her attempts, and Michael had more
				than once listened to the merry tradition, which was a favourite story with the
				overlookers; of how the silly girl had run in full sight of a dozen watchful eyes,
				till her strength failed, and she sank down among the bushes and was taken, like a
				bird that having been long confined, has no strength of wing left to bear him beyond
				reach of the first hand extended to recapture him.</p>
			<p>Yet this open postern was the only one by which it was possible to pass; but the very
				extremity of the danger of passing it, made the attempt easy; for though it was
				always carefully locked at night, and the key placed, together with those of every
				external door on the premises, under the pillow of Mr. Woodcomb, the manager had
				more than once seen a miserable little head peeping through it when left open for
				the passage of the wheelbarrow, without testifying the least alarm.</p>
			<p>The time chosen by Michael for passing this terrible door, was that during which the
				dirty herd were commanded to expose their faces and hands for a short moment to such
				cleansing as might be obtained in a huge trough, in company with a score or two of
				competitors. It was constantly a moment of great noise, bustle, and hustling; and it
				was in the midst of this that the young adventurer contrived, unobserved, to push
				back the only bolt which secured the door during the day, leaving it in a position
				to yield noiselessly to a very slight touch. At the sound of a bell, which rang
				about ten minutes after the children were turned out into the court to wash
				themselves, the whole troop hurried back again to the apprentice-house for their
				breakfast. It was then that Michael, often the last to finish the too-short
				operation of washing, remained for a moment behind the rest, and in that moment,
				opening the door just wide enough for his slender figure to pass, he slipped
				through, and closed it after him.</p>
			<p> The interval which elapsed before his departure was suspected, certainly did not
				exceed two minutes; and before the expiration of ten, <pb n="288"/> the fact was
				completely ascertained and known to nearly every inmate of the mill. </p>
			<p>Mr. Poulet's second wife, to whom he had then been married about three years, was in
				appearance the very reverse of the first, being as remarkably small, as the other
				was large. But what she wanted in muscle, was made up in watchfulness. Nothing
				escaped her restless and malignant little eyes, and either from the incessant danger
				of her spying sharpness, or the propensity of the human mind to think present
				suffering worse than every other, there were many who declared they would be glad to
				have her brutal predecessor back again. It was this woman who first descried the
				absence of Michael from the board.</p>
			<p>"Hollo! where is No. 57?" she cried.</p>
			<p>No one could answer; and No. 57 was sought for in vain from one end of the premises
				to the other.</p>
			<p>"He is gone through the yard-door!" proclaimed the active and intelligent Mrs.
				Poulet, after discovering that the bolt was withdrawn. "Off with you, you stupid old
				fool!" she added, addressing her husband; "what d'ye stand staring there for? If you
				had the wit of a jackass, you might trace him by his feet on the dew — for there are
				the marks plain enough to any body, that has sense enough to look for 'em."</p>
			<p>And so in truth there were. A continuous track of footmarks, were easily traced from
				the door to the steep bank behind the factory, where they were lost in the covert of
				bushes, which had of late years been coaxed to clothe its sides for the purpose of
				furnishing fagots. That some one had recently broken through these bushes was
				equally evident, from many boughs having been torn, and the soil beneath them
				trampled. This was enough to direct the pursuit, with so much certainty of being
				right, that Mr. Woodcomb laughed as he gave the orders for it.</p>
			<p>"The bushes last for about half a mile," said he, "and then he must take over the
				hills, of course. Fine fellow, isn't he? It will be mighty hard to take him again,
				won't it? There's only three justices of peace for him to be handed to, and only
				every man he meets ready to introduce him. The worst misfortune is, that I don't
				quite see where he is to get his dinner."</p>
			<p>Two stout overlookers started accordingly upon the track thus easily hit upon, and
				Mr. Woodcomb awaited the result of their exertions without the slightest anxiety, or
				any irritation of nerves whatever; albeit he knew that, favourite as he was, he
				might run no small risk of losing his place, should one of the apprentices really
				escape — but the thing was impossible; no one could live without eating, not even
				one who had served his apprenticeship to starving as well as piecing at the Deep
				Valley Mill. So Mr. Woodcomb slept soundly, although in ignorance of the fact that
				Michael Armstrong was already within a few feet of his premises.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XXVI. </head>
			<p>A DISMAL ENTERPRISE, AND ITS MELANCHOLY RESULT — MARTHA DOWLING PUNISHED MORE
				SEVERELY THAN SHE DESERVED — VERY WILD PROJECTS CONCEIVED BY MISS BROTHERTON, AND
				SPEEDILY PUT IN EXECUTION.</p>
			<p>
				It is now necessary that the narrative should briefly return to the
				period of Miss Brotherton's arrival at Milford Park, after her unsuccessful
				expedition in pursuit of Michael.</p>
			<p>There was no needless delay between this return to her home, and the communication to
				Mrs. Armstrong and Edward of the dismal news of which she was the bearer; nor was
				there any consultation on this occasion, concerning the mode of her reaching
				Hoxley-lane. Poor Mary had greatly advanced in independence of spirit within the
				last few months; and had she encountered all the military quartered within twenty
				miles, with the Dowling family marching in procession at their head, she would have
				quietly driven through them all, with the carriage-windows up, perhaps, but with no
				greater precaution — except, indeed, an order to the coachman to drive on without
				stopping, let them meet who they would.</p>
			<p>The carriage was at the door the morning after their return, and Miss Brotherton had
				not yet named her intended expedition to Mrs. Tremlett.</p>
			<p>"You are going out without me, my dear?" said the old lady on hearing it
				announced.</p>
			<p>"I am going to the widow Armstrong's, dear nurse," replied the heiress. "Your
				presence cannot help me through this dreaded visit. Then why should I make you share
				the pain of it?"</p>
			<p>"Why? my dear! because I am of no earthly use, and had better die at once if I cannot
				be of some little comfort to you at such a time as this. Why, don't I know all about
				it, and how you must feel at this very moment, just as well as you do yourself,
				Mary? Sure it was a foolish notion to leave me here enjoying the arm-chair and the
				foot-stool, and the flowers, while you are having your heart broken by telling that
				poor pale body, that the child she loved so dearly is dead and gone for ever."</p>
			<p>"If you could save either her or me a pang, nurse Tremlett, I would not thus have
				spared you," replied Miss Brotherton. "However, you shall go with me, dear friend.
				It is quite like yourself to wish it — and in truth, I might have guessed that you
				could not have remained easy and quiet at home while I was so engaged. And poor
				Fanny! — I have left her very busy with Martin, assisting in arranging the little
				room I have assigned her near my own. Shall we tell her where we are going, in case
				she should come in here to look for us?"</p>
			<p> "My dear Mary! If you will take my advice, you will let her go too. If you do not,
				the whole of this terrible talk will have to begin <pb n="290"/> all over again; for
				of course, when Mrs. Armstrong hears that you have got with you the only person who
				can tell any thing about her boy, she will be restless and anxious to see her — and
				then won't it be all over again, Mary?" </p>
			<p>"It will, indeed, dear nurse! You are very right, and very wise in this. She shall go
				with us, poor child. Though it will be a dreadful task for her!" replied Mary.</p>
			<p>"And you would rather take it, dear, all on your own shoulders? I do not doubt that —
				only you don't know how to manage it," replied Mrs. Tremlett. "But there is another
				thing, Mary, that I have been thinking of," continued the kind-hearted old woman,
				"and that is the other poor boy. I'll engage to say, he has never missed school for
				an hour, after what you said to him about exerting himself. I saw how he took it;
				and, therefore, you may depend upon it, that he is at the schoolhouse now. Then just
				think, my dear, what his going home will be after you have told all! Poor creatures!
				It makes one's heart sick to fancy it! If I were you, Mary, I would send for him,
				tell him every thing at once, and then take him home to his mother."</p>
			<p>Miss Brotherton instantly rose and rang the bell.</p>
			<p>"Do not say you are of no use, my dear good creature!" said she. "How infinitely
				better this will be than the hurried, thoughtless plan which I had sketched!"</p>
			<p>A message was accordingly despatched to the schoolhouse to summon Edward Armstrong,
				and in a few minutes he stood before them.</p>
			<p>Most true is it that there is something holy and imposing in the presence of sorrow.
				It would be difficult to imagine any <hi>entrée</hi> into the boudoir of Miss
				Brotherton, which would have inspired a feeling both in her and her friend so nearly
				approaching awe, as did that of Edward Armstrong.</p>
			<p>"There is no need to tell him, poor fellow!" exclaimed Mrs. Tremlett, mournfully
				shaking her head, as she saw the sudden and eloquent change in Edward's countenance
				the moment he looked in the face of Miss Brotherton. "There is no need to tell him!
				He knows it all, already!"</p>
			<p>"He is dead, then!" said the boy, his pale lips parting, as it seemed, with
				difficulty, to pronounce the words, "Please, ma'am, let me go away."</p>
			<p>He looked as if he were unable to sustain himself; and Mary, really fearing he might
				fall, started from her seat, and throwing her arms round him, almost carried him to
				the sofa.</p>
			<p>"No, no, my poor Edward!" she said, "do not go away. Stay with those who love and
				pity you! Poor Michael <hi>is</hi> dead, Edward, and we must all try to support your
				mother under the dreadful news."</p>
			<p>"How do you know he is dead?" cried Edward, starting up, and looking almost sternly
				at his benefactress. "How do you know that they have not hid him away where you
				cannot find him, that they may torture him, and work him to the bone, when there is
				nobody by to see?"</p>
			<pb n="291"/>
			<p>"I know that he is dead but too well, Edward," replied Mary, gently. "I have brought
				home with me a little girl who worked in the same factory, and who knew him well. He
				died of an infectious fever that killed many, many more. I am going to take this
				little girl with me to your mother, Edward, that she may question her, if she wishes
				it, about poor Michael, and I wish you to go with us, my dear boy; it is better that
				your poor mother should have you with her."</p>
			<p>"You are going to tell mother?" said the boy with a shudder.</p>
			<p>"Yes, Edward! — It must be done, and the sooner it is over the better. Your mother is
				a good woman, and a pious Christian, my dear boy. She will know and feel that all
				that can befall her is the will of God; and when she remembers this, she will rise
				above her sorrow, and thinking of the better world hereafter, will be able to say,
				'His will be done!'"</p>
			<p>"Yes, ma'am — if it does not kill her first," answered Edward.</p>
			<p>"Indeed, I think a great deal will depend on you, dear Edward, as to her manner of
				bearing it. If she sees you sink, be sure she will sink too; but if you make her
				feel that she has still a beloved child to live for, to whom life may yet be a
				blessing, she will cease to repine for the loss of one child, for the sake of making
				the other happy."</p>
			<p>Edward slowly and silently shook his head; but after the melancholy silence of a
				minute or two, he said, "I will do my best, ma'am."</p>
			<p>The scene which followed beside the bed of the poor widow, was one of such deep, but
				patient sorrow, as left an impression never to be forgotten on the minds of those
				who witnessed it. Mary's counsel had not been thrown away upon Edward. The boy
				displayed both a delicacy and firmness of character beyond his years, and above his
				education. No ordinary topics of consolation were clumsily uttered to redeem his
				pledge to Mary, nor did he affect a stoical indifference which he could not feel;
				but with gentle endearments he drew the mourning mother to think of him, and there
				was healing, as well as agony, in the tears she shed upon his bosom.</p>
			<p>Of all this Fanny was a silent, but deeply-moved spectator. The widow gave her one
				earnest look when Mary said, "This little girl was the last person who spoke to
				Michael before he was laid on the sick bed from whence he never rose, and she seems
				to have loved him dearly."</p>
			<p>One long earnest look was turned upon her when this was said, but no word was spoken
				to her, for the time was not yet come when the bereaved mother could seek comfort in
				any thing. Nevertheless, when Miss Brotherton rose to go, and pressing the hand of
				the poor sufferer in her own, promised to pay her another visit soon, Mrs. Armstrong
				murmured in her ear, "I should like to see that little girl again, when I can bear
				to name him." Mary nodded her assent, and left the mother and son to exchange
				thoughts and feelings, which, when deep and genuine, must ever be held sacred from
				every unkindred eye.</p>
			<p> Most watchfully did Mary attend to this poor pensioner; and many were the hours
				during which she sat, reading the book of life beside <pb n="292"/> her bed. By
				degrees, too, the bereaved mother did bear to name her lost darling to Fanny
				Fletcher; and having once listened to the sweet tones of her gentle voice, as she
				related all she had heard him say, all he had seemed to feel, and all he had seemed
				to think, the poor woman grew so enamoured of the uneventful tale, that she wearied
				not of making her repeat it. For days together Fanny would beg to be left beside
				her, while Edward resumed his place in the school; and Miss Brotherton often
				thought, when she drove to Hoxley-lane in the evenings, to bring back her little
					<hi>Protégée</hi> , that she had never chanced to witness so pretty a specimen
				of female tenderness and pity, as this lovely little girl exhibited, while
				ministering to the poor crippled woman, whose only claim upon her love was, that she
				wanted it — a species of claim, by the by, that is very rarely made in vain upon any
				uncorrupted female heart. </p>
			<p>With every want prevented, soothed by the most generous kindness, attended with the
				most watchful love, and cheered by a greater appearance of reviving health in the
				boy that she had thought crippled for life, than she had ever ventured to hope for,
				it might have been expected that the widow Armstrong would, in some degree, have
				forgotten passed sufferings, and have once more looked forward with hope. But no, it
				could not be! This last, this heaviest of all her sorrows came too late to be
				wrestled with, as others had been; and though her meek nature seemed so peacefully
				resigned, that there was more pleasure than pain in watching over her, she was, in
				truth, dying of a worn-out spirit and a broken heart.</p>
			<p>By some means or other, the news that little Michael Armstrong was dead, reached
				Dowling Lodge. Sir Matthew knit his brows — wondered how the devil any body could
				have got tidings of him, but said nothing. To all the rest of the family, save one,
				the intelligence was too unimportant to be listened to at all; but to that one, to
				the already conscience-stricken and repentant Martha, it was a heavy blow! Most
				miserable, indeed, had been her state of mind for the last few months; from the day
				of her painful, but useless visit to Miss Brotherton, her eyes had been, in a great
				degree, opened to the hard and avaricious nature of her father's character. Like a
				person excluded from the light of the sun, and seeing only by the delusive glare of
				an unsteady lamp, Martha had passed her whole life in mistaking the nature and the
				value of almost every object around her. The language of Mary Brotherton had shot
				with a painful and unwelcome brightness upon the dim and uncertain twilight of her
				moral perceptions; and the unhappy girl learned to know that the only being who had
				ever seemed to love her, or whom she had ever ventured to love, was one that her
				better reason shrunk from, and her sober judgment condemned.</p>
			<p> Yet still he was her father, and still she loved him, and gladly, joyfully, would
				she have given her young life, could she thereby have changed his love of gold, for
				love of mercy. Sometimes she thought that time and age would teach him the
				hollowness of his present pursuits, and that if she never left him, but ever stood
				ready at his side <pb n="293"/> to watch some favourable moment, she might have the
				surpassing joy of seeing his heart open to the truth, and in a state to permit her
				helping to lead him to efficient repentance, and the all-merciful forgiveness of
				God. It was impossible but that such thoughts and feelings must separate her, more
				than ever, from the rest of her family, and she had already pretty generally
				received the epithet of <hi>methodistical</hi> , from the whole neighbourhood; but
				she hailed it as a blessing, and without a shadow of religious enthusiasm, beyond
				what was almost inevitable under the circumstances, and with no sectarian views or
				notions whatever, poor Martha gladly sheltered herself under the imputation of both
				in order to avoid joining in scenes of amusement for which she had no relish. </p>
			<p>In such a state of mind it was natural enough that Martha should deem a visit to the
				bereaved mother a penance which it was her duty to perform (though it was more
				painful to her, perhaps, than almost any other to which she could have been
				subjected), and she did perform it accordingly. She found the poor sufferer, whose
				eye she dreaded to meet, sinking fast into peace and rest, that never more could be
				disturbed. Miss Brotherton and Fanny were both with her; a bible was in the hands of
				the former, and Mrs. Armstrong's countenance, though greatly more pinched and pallid
				than she had ever before seen it, expressed a tranquil calmness which it was
				impossible to contemplate without pleasure.</p>
			<p>But, alas! for poor Martha! she had the pang of seeing this consoled and consoling
				look suddenly changed to an expression of intense suffering, the moment her own
				person met the poor woman's eye. They had never seen each other since the fatal
				morning on which Martha had so innocently persuaded her to sign the articles of her
				boy's apprenticeship, and the recollection of that scene, and all its consequences,
				could not so suddenly come upon one, reduced already to almost the last stage of
				weakness, without shaking her terribly. The distended eye, the open mouth, the
				heaving breast, all spoke a degree of agitation, which in her condition was
				frightfully alarming; and Mary, who dreaded lest the calmness of her last moments
				should be disturbed, hastily turned to the intruder, and said, "Go, go! — the sight
				of you will kill her!"</p>
			<p>Though there was no more of harshness in this, than the urgent circumstances of the
				case seemed to call for, Mary Brotherton would have rather died than utter it, could
				she have guessed the pang it gave to the already wounded heart of poor Martha. She
				made no reply; but, fixing on the victim of her most innocent delusion, a look, just
				long enough to impress the terrible expression of her countenance upon her own heart
				for ever, she turned away, and reached her splendid home in a state of mind that
				seemed fearfully to verify the annunciation, "He will visit the sins of the fathers
				upon the children."</p>
			<p> That day was the last of the widow's life, and it is probable it might have been so,
				even if Martha Dowling had not made her unfortunate visit; but the coincidence was
				fatal to the poor girl's peace, for the anxious inquiries she made respecting her,
				brought the intelligence of <pb n="294"/> her death, and the time of it, with
				sufficient accuracy to leave no doubt on Martha's mind, that the event had been
				accelerated by her appearance. </p>
			<p>Happily, however, for those who tenderly watched her last moments, the widow
				Armstrong's gentle nature permitted her not long to suffer from the irritation which
				the presence of Martha produced, and many hours before she closed her eyes for ever,
				she expressed her sorrow for having yielded so weakly to feelings which she had
				hoped were altogether conquered; assuring Mary (who never left her) that she
				acquitted the young lady of all intention to deceive her, and that the shock she
				felt from seeing her, only proceeded from the vivid recollections her appearance
				awakened.</p>
			<p>Unhappily, however, it was long ere this healing assurance reached poor Martha; for
				Miss Brotherton, who was far from guessing its importance to her, had decided upon
				having no further intercourse with the Dowling family: a resolution which would
				never have been taken had her last interview with Martha at Milford Park ended more
				pleasantly. But it had been already so long acted upon, that it would have been
				equally awkward and disagreeable to break through it; and Martha long continued in
				the terrible persuasion that she had been accessory to the death of both mother and
				son.</p>
			<p> The loss of the only relatives he had ever known, following as they did so closely
				on each other, made Mary tremble for the health of Edward. She had watched the
				affecting close of the poor widow's life with all the tender feeling such a
				spectacle was calculated to excite in such a heart as hers. She had mourned for
				Michael for many reasons, and mourned sincerely; but she had hardly known the boy,
				and it was her sympathy with the sorrow of others, rather than her own, which caused
				the event to touch her so deeply. But to Edward she had become attached with so much
				fondness, and he had inspired such a feeling of wondering admiration in her mind by
				the extraordinary faculties he displayed, and the justness and uprightness of every
				thought and feeling, that to watch over his health and welfare had become nearly the
				first object of her isolated existence. The few months which had elapsed since the
				whole system of his life had been changed from all that was most injurious to
				health, to a mode of living in every way conducive to its recovery, had produced a
				more favourable and decisive effect on him, than could have been reasonably hoped
				for in the time; and it was a remarkable evidence of the powerful influence which
				such a change produces on the frame, that not all the sorrow and suffering which
				Miss Brotherton's intelligence brought, or the heart-wringing loss which followed
				it, could check the active energy of benignant nature in restoring health, where all
				she required for it was given, and all that had hitherto impeded her kindly
				operations was removed. Yet Edward was still lame, though so much less so than he
				had been, that his benefactress could not help indulging a hope that time and
				judicious treatment might remove the infirmity altogether. For some reason or other
				Miss Brotherton entertained no very particular respect for the medical practitioners
				of her immediate <pb n="295"/> neighbourhood, and for several months after her
				return she contented herself with following Mr. Bell's prescriptions, for friction
				and moderate exercise, without calling in any medical assistance at all. But though
				the improvement that followed was very perceptible, it was not rapid, and the idea
				of London advice suggested itself, as the most satisfactory mode of ascertaining at
				once whether a perfect recovery might be hoped for; information which it was very
				desirable she should obtain, before she decided in what way she should bring him up.
				Since the death of his mother, Milford Park had been Edward's home, and the orphan
				boy's hold on Miss Brotherton's warm heart had been greatly increased by the
				opportunities this gave her of more frequent intercourse with her. In truth, though
				he still attended the school for an hour or two every morning, by far the more
				important portion of his education went on under her own eye, and, as well as that
				of his little companion Fanny, was beginning to take a form and extent totally
				different from what she had at first intended for either of them. Ideas respecting
				them both, began by degrees to arise in her mind, which she at first endeavoured to
				resist, as being too much out of the usual course to be safely indulged in; but "use
				lessens marvel," and the notion of making a man of learning of Edward, and a woman
				of fortune of Fanny, which once and again she had rejected, as too romantic and
				absurd, gradually grew into an habitual theme of meditation on which her fancy
				delighted to fix itself. </p>
			<p>Mary Brotherton was at that time about twenty-two years old, extremely pretty, and
				moreover almost childishly young-looking for her age; and whatever she might have
				brought herself to think of it, most others would very naturally have deemed her
				adopting a boy of twelve, and a girl of eleven, a most outrageously preposterous and
				imprudent act. But her situation was one in most respects quite out of the common
				way, and she every day felt it more impossible that she could continue to endure the
				station of one of the magnates of a manufacturing neighbourhood, with all eyes fixed
				upon every thing she did, and her whole heart and soul recoiling from companionship
				with the only persons whom her neighbours and watchers would deem fit to be her
				particular friends.</p>
			<p> The heart of this isolated girl was so clingingly affectionate that it is probable
				she would, under almost any other circumstances, have at least loved the beautiful
				mansion in which she had passed the greatest part of her life, and felt the trees
				and flowers that adorned it to be as companions, and familiar friends; but a
				thousand painful thoughts were mingled with the consciousness that she was mistress
				of that fair domain; and the very fact that the education she felt inclined to
				bestow upon the two orphans would bring down upon her the criticisms, and probably
				the reprobation, of the whole neighbourhood, making it very desirable that the
				extraordinary project should be carried into execution elsewhere, was in her
				estimation more in its favour, than agains it. When, in addition to all this, she
				succeeded in persuading herself, from some of her miscellaneous reading, that there
				were German baths which might assist the restoration of Edward's limbs, and <pb n="296"/> that it was her duty to consult the most approved authorities upon his
				case, the decision to leave Milford Park, and remove to London, was at no great
				distance. </p>
			<p>Had her valued friend and counsellor, Mr. Bell, led her to believe that all the
				wealth she had, if thrown back among the class from which it was drawn, could have
				sufficed to remedy the evils under which they groaned, she was quite capable of
				stripping herself to her last shilling for the purpose; but he knew better, and he
				taught her to know better too; and having convinced himself that her best chance of
				happiness, as well as her best opportunity of doing good, would be in yielding to
				the affection which "her boy and girl" had inspired, he promised to assist her
				projected removal, by seeing that the orders she left, respecting her property, were
				faithfully executed; and, about eight months after the death of Mrs. Armstrong, the
				heiress left her parks and gardens, her splendid mansion and all its gorgeous
				appurtenances, to attend the orphan boy to London.</p>
			<p>The consultation which, immediately after her arrival there, took place upon the case
				of Edward, was productive of, perhaps, the greatest pleasure Mary had ever known;
				for the sentence unanimously pronounced was, that the limbs of the boy were in a
				state of progress towards perfect recovery, the weakness and distortion brought on
				by his employment, not having lasted long enough to produce any deformity, capable
				of resisting the tendency of nature to recover herself, if not impeded by any fresh
				unhealthy influence. That any such should arise to disappoint her hopes was not
				likely; all that was required for him being good air, regular and moderate exercise,
				wholesome food, and abstinence from all violent exertion for the next year or two.
				As to her question respecting German baths, the answer was less unanimous; two
				gentlemen being of opinion that they would do no good at all; two that it was
				doubtful whether the case would be affected by them or not; and one that great
				benefit might probably ensue. But as all were of opinion that change of air was
				desirable, and as a pretty strong inclination to try fresh fields and pastures new
				seconded this judgment, Miss Brotherton determined to start for the Rhine. Mrs.
				Tremlett declared that she had not the slightest objection to foreign parts;
				Edward's heart swelled with an ecstasy made up of gratitude, hope, curiosity, and
				the delicious exhilaration attendant upon returning health; while Fanny looked
				around her, and listened to every one whose words referred to the expedition, with a
				very delightful consciousness of being wide awake, but not without some fear that
				she was dreaming, nevertheless.</p>
			<p>Such was the party that filled the travelling-carriage of Miss Brotherton, while an
				English maid, a French footman, and a German courier, formed her suite.</p>
			<p>Nothing, certainly, could be well more whimsical than the party with which she had
				thus surrounded herself; but this mattered little, since she was pleased with it —
				and we must leave her in the full enjoyment of a whole host of delightful feelings,
				while we return to follow the fortunes of poor Michael.</p>

			<p>MICHAEL ARMSTRONG SETS OUT UPON A DANGEROUS EXPEDITION — ITS TERMINATION PROVES
				RATHER MORE THEN HE CAN BEAR — HE MEETS A GOOD MAN, AND TAKES SERVICE UNDER HIM — HE
				ASKS AND OBTAINS A HOLIDAY, AND MEETS SEVERAL ADVENTURES IN THE COURSE OF IT.</p>
			<p>
				While this gay and happy party, who would any of them have gladly
				exchanged pleasure for pain, could they thereby have purchased only the knowledge of
				his existence, were thus placing kingdoms between them, the unhappy Michael was
				still enduring all the miseries of an apprentice at the Deep Valley Mill.</p>
			<p>It would be difficult to imagine a stronger contrast in the situation of two brothers
				than that which many subsequent years presented between him and Edward. Edward! —
				who had ever been to him as a dearer second self — who had never enjoyed a pleasure
				unshared by him, and never known a sorrow that had not also been his — Edward was
				enjoying all that nature and fortune could give; while Michael still hopelessly
				dragged on a wretched existence amidst unceasing and unvarying suffering! At length
				the desperate resolution was formed which put the officials of the Deep Valley
				factory in the state of activity already described. And where was Michael the
				while?</p>
			<p>Safely ensconced in a sort of rude drain, which he had himself assisted to construct,
				when he held the regretted office of scavenger of the court, and over the aperture
				of which he easily arranged sticks and rubbish sufficient to conceal him, Michael
				lay for many hours listening to the hubbub which his absence occasioned. He
				distinctly heard the expression of Mrs. Poulet's anger and scorn, as messenger after
				messenger returned, without bringing tidings of him; and had, moreover, the
				advantage of knowing the track that he had purposely made on the grass which grew
				tall and rank immediately behind the factory, had led them, and would continue to
				lead them, all one way, while he would of course take especial care to go
				another.</p>
			<p>Having left his foot-marks on the grass in the manner described, Michael had
				scrambled through the bushes which covered the steep hill-side, for the distance of
				a few hundred yards, and then, taking advantage of a layer of stones, by which a
				patch of marshy ground had been rendered firm, he again crossed from the hill
				towards the factory, without leaving any trace behind. By this simple device his
				pursuers were completely thrown out, for when night came and he crawled out from his
				shelter, no eye was open to look for him close to his prison-walls, though very keen
				ones were busy elsewhere in search of him.</p>
			<p> The same strength of frame which had enabled him to escape deformity in the mill,
				helped him well now, as without food, without <pb n="298"/> sleep, and with every
				pulse throbbing between hope and fear, he strode rapidly onward on the road he had
				come with Parsons four years before, carefully avoiding its grassy margin, however,
				lest more footsteps might be traced. Then, revolving with great clearness of local
				recollection, the direction in which this road led, after mounting the hill, he
				firmly resolved, as long as his strength lasted, to pursue it, till it brought him
				to the door of his mother's home — provided always, that he was not stopped short by
				the grasp of an overlooker in the way. </p>
			<p>The necessity of procuring food had not appeared to him any obstacle to the
				undertaking; for not only had he great faith in his own power of enduring
				abstinence, but he had faith too, in the impossibility of begging at a firm-house
				door for a morsel of bread, in vain — nor did either hope deceive him: he walked
				till nightfall with no other refreshment than water, caught in the hollow of his
				hand from a trickling road-side spring, and a few blackberries, snatched in terror,
				as he hurried on.</p>
			<p>As the darkness thickened round him, he called a counsel with himself, as to whether
				it would be wisest to lay down under the shelter of a hay-rick, and let sleep serve
				him for supper, or to venture a petition for a morsel of food at a decent-looking
				mansion which he saw at some distance, and walk on through the night, if he
				succeeded, by help of the strength so recruited.</p>
			<p>After many anxious reasonings, pro and con, he at last decided upon the latter, and
				so well did his handsome face and simple assurance that he was very hungry, plead
				for him, that he not only obtained scraps sufficient for a hearty supper, but a
				crust or two for the following morning; and with this treasure he trudged on,
				footsore indeed, and with a pretty strong inclination to lie down and sleep, but
				mental energy sufficed for many hours to conquer bodily fatigue, and it was not till
				past three o'clock the next morning, that he yielded, and at last laid himself down
				in a dry, and, as he thought it, most delightfully comfortable ditch, and slept the
				sleep of youth and weariness for three four hours. The bright beams of an autumn sun
				shooting directly upon his eyes awakened him, and he started up, ready and able to
				walk forward, sufficiently thankful for the hoarded crusts in his pocket.</p>
			<p> He was now not more than seven miles from Ashleigh; a fact which he joyfully
				ascertained by a milestone on a road which he had reached, he hardly knew how, but
				it must have been by missing, not hitting the way he had endeavoured to find; for
				Parsons had not followed the high-road from the town for more than a mile, and that
				was before Sir Matthew's carriage overtook him. Michael looked backwards and
				forwards along this wide unsheltered road, and trembled to think how easy it would
				be, to see and recognise a fugitive from any spot within sight of it; but there was
				a burning impatience at his heart when he thought of home, and remembered that he
				was within two hours walk of it, which left all caution far behind, and <pb n="299"/> commending himself to God, he set off at the fleetest pace he could achieve,
				towards Ashleigh. </p>
			<p>No symptom of pursuit, however, alarmed him. From the moment he quitted the mills, to
				that when he reached what had once been his mother's door, no terror of the kind had
				come near him; he had heard no whispering voices, nor seen shadowy figures stealing
				towards him from a distance. All he had most feared was got through with ease; but
				all he had most fondly hoped, turned out a fearful blank.</p>
			<p>As Michael drew near the door, he remembered so well every object which met his eye,
				that he began to fear lest he himself might be remembered by others, and making a
				circuit to avoid Sir Matthew's mills, he reached Hoxley-lane without having met a
				single face he knew.</p>
			<p>It was a tremendous moment for him, that in which he first caught sight of the lowly
				door through which he had passed a thousand times in eager anticipation of his
				mother's kiss! Some minutes followed before he could reach it, and the boy trembled
				so violently that he tottered as he hurried onward, like a drunken man.</p>
			<p>At length his hand was on the latch; it yielded as in days of yore, and in an instant
				the door was wide open before him. Poor Michael! what death can have a pang so
				bitter as that he felt, when the almost impossible project of reaching his mother's
				home being performed, he found that home empty and desolate, and telling him as
				plainly as angels trumpet-tongued could do, that she was dead!</p>
			<p>A dismal groan burst from him, and he sunk on the floor, just where he had last stood
				gaily talking to her of his bright fancies for the future, a few hours before he was
				snatched away from her for ever.</p>
			<p>The noise he made reached the ears of a woman in the front room, and she opened the
				door of communication to ascertain who it could be, rummaging in the empty room that
				was "to let."</p>
			<p>"My gracious! I should like to know who you are? What do you want here, you
				ragamuffin? Is this the way you come to take lodgings, pray?"</p>
			<p>This was said by a young and pretty woman who held a baby in her arms, and who being
				the wife of a confidential overlooker, had not only succeeded to the occupation of
				No. 12, upon the death of Mrs. Sykes and the dispersion of her family; but
				considered herself privileged to assume, on most occasions, an air of great
				importance.</p>
			<p>"Mother lived here!" said Michael, with a look wretched enough to soften the heart of
				the saucy girl who had addressed him.</p>
			<p>"Your mother, my poor boy? Are you the little orphan Armstrong, then?" was the
				reply.</p>
			<p>"Is mother dead?" said the unhappy boy.</p>
			<p>"Dead? to be sure she is. And where can you have been not to know that? Wasn't you
				with her, when she died?"</p>
			<p>"No, no, no!" sobbed Michael; "I came here to find her."</p>
			<p>"Poor fellow! that's dismal enough to be sure. I bean't Ashleigh born, but I have
				heard a deal since I comed here, about the widow Armstrong and the boy as died!"</p>
			<pb n="300"/>
			<p>"Died!" echoed Michael, looking wildly at her. "Is he dead too? Is my poor Teddy
				dead?"</p>
			<p>"Sure-ly he is," replied the unthinking young woman, who, in truth, knew nothing
				about either the widow Armstrong or her son, but remembered hearing that a little
				more than a year before she took possession of the premises, a widow Armstrong had
				died in the back room, for grief at having lost a boy. She was far from intending to
				be cruel to the poor lad, who looked himself so very nearly like a corpse, but was
				too indifferent upon all subjects which did not immediately concern herself, to take
				the trouble of thinking before she spoke.</p>
			<p>A few more questions might probably have obtained, if not the truth, at least some
				proof of his informer's ignorance of it, but Michael had heard enough; he rose to
				his feet, and without uttering another word, rushed out of the room.</p>
			<p>The state in which he then found himself was certainly nearly approaching to
				delirium. His strength of body and mind completely exhausted by fatigue, fasting,
				and intense anxiety, the blow which had fallen upon him was heavier than his reason
				could bear, and he wandered forth into the fields without knowing where he was, or
				having any distinct idea of what had befallen him. His devious and unheeded path led
				him to a spot, at the distance of nearly a mile from his former home, at which
				several miniature rocks of sandstone give something of wildness and dignity to the
				little stream, which for the most part runs tamely enough, and looks little more
				than a wide and dirty ditch, as it passes through the town of Ashleigh. A multitude
				of cotton-factories, with their tall chimneys mocking the heavens, were visible in
				the distance, on the other side, and the boy stopped in his wild, hurried walk, to
				gaze upon them, with a feverish consciousness that there at least stood something he
				had seen before. A frightful flash of memory then shot across his brain — his mother
				dead — his darling Edward dead — himself a houseless, friendless, starving wretch,
				who soon would be caught and carried back to the prison-house he had ran from only
				to learn that he had no friend on earth! Such were the thoughts which racked him, as
				he stood upon the edge of the rocky little precipice, and fixed his eyes upon the
				quite water that flowed some twenty feet beneath him. It seemed to present an image
				of coolness and repose; his burning lips longed to kiss the gentle ripple on its
				surface — he drew nearer to the extremest verge.</p>
			<p>"I should be safe there!" he murmured, looking downwards till his sick head reeled.
				"God forgive me!" he added, raising his eyes to heaven. "But if I drown, mother! I
				shall go to thee!" and as he spoke the words, he sprang forward, and plunged into
				the stream!</p>
			<p> The shock restored his wandering senses in a moment; he felt that he was perishing,
				though unconscious that it was by his own act; and forgetting how little reason he
				had to wish for life, struggled hard to grasp a bush that protruded from the bank
				into the stream. But he could not swim, and the efforts he made, though they served
				for a minute or two to keep him afloat, only increased the distance between <pb n="301"/> himself and the object he endeavoured to reach. His heavy shoes filled
				with water, and dragged him downwards — his strength failed, his arms ceased to
				move, and in another moment the water rippled over his head. </p>
			<p>But poor Michael's history was not finished yet. A heavy-looking elderly man, who had
				as little as possible the air of one desirous of seeking an adventure, was in the
				act of examining some sheep in a field, the fence of which was not fifty yards from
				the rocky ledge from whence the boy had sprung. Having completed his survey, and
				directed two men who were with him to select a score or two from the lot, the old
				man reposed himself upon a style in the fence above mentioned, and having chanced to
				turn his head from the sheep, towards the spot where Michael stood, had watched for
				a minute or two the boy's agitated movements and demeanour, but without the
				slightest suspicion of the frightful catastrophe that was to ensue.</p>
			<p>No sooner, however, did he hear the splash occasioned by the plunge, than he sprang
				over the style with the activity of a younger man, and calling to the others to
				follow him, made his way with little loss of time, to a bit of pebbly ground on a
				level with the stream, and at no great distance from the point at which Michael had
				sunk. But, short as the time had been, the ripple had already disappeared from the
				surface of the water, and no trace remained of the object of his search. The two
				young men whom he had summoned to follow him, though they had not seen the accident,
				had gathered from his words that something terrible had occurred, and clambering
				down the rocky cliff, were by his side in a moment.</p>
			<p>"It is too late, lads!" exclaimed the old man, wringing his hands together. "I saw
				the poor distracted creature take the leap, but he was sunk before I got to the
				bank, and I take it he will never rise again. I shall never forgive myself for not
				going to him when I saw him throwing his arms about in that wild way. I might have
				guessed what was going to happen — and may Heaven forgive me for not preventing
				it!"</p>
			<p>"'Tis a man who has thrown himself in?" inquired one of the men.</p>
			<p>"Not a man, but a fine young lad as ever you see. Poor fellow! 'Twas early days for
				him to have found sorrow enough to throw himself out of life that way! If I had ran
				to him, as I ought to have done, and stopped the deed, who knows but we might have
				brought him round to a better manner of thinking?"</p>
			<p>"'Tis ten to one but he'll come to the top again yet, if he hasn't done it already,"
				said the man.</p>
			<p>"But if he comes, he'll come dead, William!" replied the old man.</p>
			<p>"I don't know that," rejoined the young shepherd." "The stream runs briskish round
				yon corner, and would carry him right away with it; but it's worth while having a
				look lower down. If he rises at all, 'twill be there."</p>
			<p> And so saying, the young man set off at a swifter pace than his master could follow
				him; while the old man and the other shepherd-lad <pb n="302"/> continued for a
				minute or two to watch the place where he had fallen. </p>
			<p>"Halloo! Halloo! Halloo!" cried a voice at no great distance.</p>
			<p>"That's William, by all that's good!" exclaimed the young shepherd, and without
				waiting for his companion's reply, he ran off at full speed, the old man following
				with no lagging step, and at the distance of a few yards, after turning the corner
				formed by another huge mass of sandstone rock, they perceived William, breast deep
				in the water, and grasping, at the utmost extent of his arm, a limb of the drowning
				boy. Before the old Westmorland statesman (for such he was) could overtake his young
				companions, the hero of our tale was lying high and dry upon the bank, but whether
				life was quite extinct, or still lingered in the cold, corse-like form before them,
				was a question which, when the old man joined the group, the young ones were not
				able to answer. Luckily for Michael, the old statesman had seen a man saved from
				drowning some thirty years before, and he remembered enough of the process he had
				then witnessed, to enable him to give some very useful instructions on the present
				occasion. They managed to make their patient discharge from his mouth some portion
				of the superfluous draught he had swallowed, and after bestowing patient and
				assiduous friction on his breast and limbs, they had the great satisfaction of
				seeing the chest heave with returning respiration, and all other symptoms of
				revivification follow in their proper order, till the eyes of Michael were once more
				widely opened, and fixed with preplexity, and something like terror, on the faces
				which were bending over him.</p>
			<p>"Thank Heaven!" ejaculated the old man earnestly, "he's safe now, at least from
				drowning, and I have not got that to answer for. But he isn't in a trim to be left,
				my lads. He would have been as well in the river, perhaps, as out of it, if we do no
				more for him."</p>
			<p>Then causing Michael to sit, and examining his features, with a glance of very
				friendly curiosity, he said,</p>
			<p>"You don't look like a bad boy, my poor fellow. What could have set you upon doing
				such a desperate action?"</p>
			<p>The effort which the poor boy made to answer was ineffectual, and he only shook his
				head.</p>
			<p>"I suppose it's oversoon as yet, to expect any information from him," resumed the old
				man, "so there's nothing to be done, as I see, but just to carry him up between us,
				if he cannot walk, to the Nag's Head, and have him laid upon my bed there, till he
				is a condition to tell us something about himself. Can you feel your legs yet, my
				boy?" he continued, endeavouring, by the help of his man William, to make him stand
				up.</p>
			<p> But Michael had no power to second their efforts; the two lads, threfore, raised him
				head and heels, and preceded by the grayhaired farmer, bore him between them above a
				mile, to the humble hostelry of the Nag's Head. The procession was too remarkable a
				one to escape notice, and before it reached the shelter of the little inn a
				miscellaneous crowd of men, women, and children had joined it. Many of these had
				been familiar with the features of poor Michael in <pb n="303"/> days of yore, but
				not one of them recognised the widow Armstrong's boy, in the long-limbed, pallid
				figure, that they now gazed upon. </p>
			<p>Muster Thornton, the Westmorland yeoman and farmer, was too substantial a customer to
				be refused any reasonable favour, and the ragged, dripping Michael was not only
				permitted to lie down on Muster Thornton's best of beds, but accommodated promptly
				with dry linen, and duly comforted with more hot brandy, water, sugar, and biscuits
				than he had any inclination to swallow. He took enough, however, to remove the
				faintness of inanition; and this, together with dry linen, and a bed, sufficed, in
				spite of the heavy sorrows upon which his mind had not yet dared to fix itself, to
				sooth him into a long and healing sleep.</p>
			<p>When he awoke from it, he was capable of answering all the questions Mr. Thornton put
				to him, and this he did with a simplicity of pathos that went straight to the good
				man's heart. That he had been working in a distant cotton-factory, where he had been
				very hardly treated, and having got away to see his mother and his brother, had
				found them both dead, was a tale, that if it could not excuse the desperate act
				which he had attempted, at least accounted for it, in a manner that left as much to
				pity as to blame.</p>
			<p>"Poor boy! poor boy!" exclaimed the old man, with tears in his eyes. "It was wrong
				and wicked, very wrong and wicked! but you must pray God to forgive you, my boy, and
				never think of any such desperate doings more."</p>
			<p>"I did not know what I was about, if I remember rightly," said Michael. "My head
				seemed gone. I don't know how I got to the river, but I am sure I did not go there
				on purpose."</p>
			<p>"So much the better — I am glad to hear it — and it's no great wonder, sure enough,
				if you did lose your head, coming to such a home as that. But what are you to do
				next, my poor fellow? I suppose there is no other home for you, is there?"</p>
			<p>"I have no home, nor a single friend in the whole world," replied Michael.</p>
			<p>"And the only work you have ever been used to, I suppose, is following the wheels in
				the factories?" said the farmer.</p>
			<p>"Except once for three months and a bit that I was kept to cleaning the outhouses and
				yard, and wheeling away garden-rubbish and such like," replied Michael.</p>
			<p>"Well, but that's better than nothing, boy. At any rate, you know how to hold a
				spade, which is a long deal better than having never used your fingers, except for
				tying bits of thread. D'ye think you should be willing to work for me, my boy, and
				tend my farm-yard stock, and do a turn of work in the fields when it was
				wanted?"</p>
			<p>"I <hi>should</hi> be willing, sir," replied Michael, while a flush passed over his
				pale face, "I should be willing and most thankful to work for you."</p>
			<p> "That's well," said the old man cheerily, "and as to terms, I don't expect we shall
				find much difficulty; you will come to me my poor fellow, much in the same condition
				as you first come into the world, <pb n="304"/> therefore all that you want, I must
				find, which will be about as much as I can afford to give, I take it, just at first,
				till you, and I too, find out what you're good for. Will you agree to it, my lad,
				and give me your time and best endeavours for clothes, food, lodging, and good
				will?" </p>
			<p>"It will be a blessed bargain for me, sir," said Michael, "if you will add to all
				your goodness the excusing my ignorance. But if <hi>will</hi> was all that was
				wanting to make a good servant, you should not lose by me."</p>
			<p>"And will <hi>is</hi> all that is wanting, boy. You are no fool, I take it, by your
				looks; and if you will mind what is said, and do your best, I shall ask no more.
				What is your name, my good fellow?"</p>
			<p>"Michael — Michael Armstrong, sir."</p>
			<p>"Well, then, Michael Armstrong, I am your master, and you are my man. And now you
				must eat, and then you must go to sleep again, I think, till I have got some decent
				clothes for you. Those you wore yesterday have had a good washing to be sure.
				Nevertheless, I don't justly like the looks of them."</p>
			<milestone unit="structural" rend="stars"/>
			<p> Within six months from this time, Michael Armstrong, promoted to a place of trust,
				might have been seen sitting upon the hill-side in one of the most romantic spots in
				Westmorland, a shepherd's maud wrapped round his person, a sheep-dog at his feet,
				and his master's flocks nibbling the short grass around him on all sides. Many were
				the solitary hours he thus passed, and very rich was the harvest they brought him.
				Had the boy remained a year or two longer in the state that "Blocks out the forms of
				nature, preconsumes The reason, famishes the heart, shuts up The infant being in
				itself, and makes Its very spring a season of decay;" <ref target="#ENG18400N5">[5]</ref> had Michael remained a
				year or two longer at the Deep Valley factory, in the state thus admirably and
				accurately described, it would have been too late for any contemplation of God's
				works to have roused his withered spirit to worship and to hope. But as it was, his
				mind seemed to awaken day by day from the long and heavy sleep in which it had been
				plunged. With an intellect naturally vigorous, and covetous of acquirement, and
				having had his first infant stretch of thought happily and indelibly directed,
				though with primeval simplicity, to one God and father of all, his transition from a
				condition in which "Scarcely could you fancy that a gleam Could break from out those
				languid eyes," <ref target="#ENG18400N6">[6]</ref> to one "Sublime from
				present purity and joy," <ref target="#ENG18400N7">[7]</ref> was rapid and delightful.
				His heavy losses were not forgotten; but while he meditated beneath the bright arch
				of heaven on the mother and the brother he had so fondly loved, there were so many
				sublime <pb n="305"/> and hope-inspiring thoughts mixed with his sorrow, that it
				could hardly have been called painful. </p>
			<p>The worthy "statesman" to whose service he had vowed himself, though he did not,
				perhaps, follow Michael through all the improving processes which his mountain
				occupation led to, nor very clearly comprehend the elevating effect of the "skyey
				influences" under which he lived, was no way slow in perceiving that the Samaritan
				feeling he had so opportunely displayed in the township of Ashleigh, had bound to
				his service one of the most trustworthy, active, and intelligent lads he had ever
				met with. There is always, moreover, in the human heart a propensity to cherish
				whatever we have preserved; and this feeling, joined to his more worldly-minded
				approbation of Michael's good gifts, rendered Muster Thornton exceedingly fond of
				the boy, and well-inclined at all times to grant him every reasonable indulgence.
				But Michael rarely taxed his kindness as far as it was ready to go. Once he had
				asked, and obtained leave to mount to the top of Helvellyn, and once to make a
				sabbath-day's journey over the mountain-tops to Ulswater; these were the only
				occasions on which he had expressed any wish to wander beyond the immediate
				neighbourhood of the farmer's sheep-walks, and, in truth, this immediate
				neighbourhood included so many mountain torrents, glassy lakes, stupendous crags,
				and sylvan solitudes, that there was little need to go beyond it, in order to
				gratify a passion for the picturesque. But when Michael had attained the age of
				eighteen years, a longing, and somewhat restless desire seized him to revisit the
				place of his birth, to seek for the graves of his mother and Edward, to learn
				tidings of the kind-hearted Martha, to discover, if possible, whether his own escape
				from the Deep Valley had been communicated to Sir Matthew, and to ascertain whether
				he still stood in any danger of being reclaimed as an apprentice, in case of its
				being discovered that he was at liberty. As to any danger of being personally
				recognised at Ashleigh, he feared it not; conscious that from his remarkably tall
				stature and florid health, he was too unlike the factory-child of former days, to
				run any risk of being known.</p>
			<p>It was, however, some months after this wish first suggested itself, before he took
				courage to name it to his indulgent master. When at length, however, he did so, the
				good man not only gave his free consent, but declared himself well pleased that such
				a project had entered his favourite's head.</p>
			<p>"It will do thee a power of good, Mike," said he. "The only fault I have to find with
				thee is, that thee beest too steady for a lad of thy years, and that looks as if,
				with all our care and coaxing, we had not yet been able to make thee forget thy
				sorrowful childhood. Set off, in God's name, my boy; stay as long as thou wilt, but
				only promise to come back at last, for I think it would be heart-aching work to part
				with thee."</p>
			<p> Michael gratefully promised a speedy return, and dressed in his best attire, he set
				forth upon his much wished-for pilgrimage to his early home. "It was the pride, the
				spring tide of the year," every leaf was <pb n="306"/> opened, yet every leaf
				retained the new-born freshness of its lovely green. The birds saluted him from
				every bush; the herds lowed from amidst their dewy banquet, in a note that spoke
				their measureless content; and every object on which his bright young eye fixed
				itself, seemed to echo the abounding gladness of his own heart. How elastic was the
				step with which he passed along! How proudly and thankfully did he feel conscious of
				his own high place amidst this wondrous creation! and how perfectly was he
				convinced, despite all he had read during his lone hours on the mountain-side, of
				the splendour of the cities of the earth, that nothing on its whole surface could
				exceed in grace and glory the majesty of the gorgeous sun, as he rose triumphantly
				from out his bed of gold! Had every thought of the boy's heart been chronicled, a
				very poetical sort of hymn would have been the result; but as it was, all the
				glowing thankfulness, the heavenward rapture, and the joy supreme, was but for
				himself alone — yet was it not thrown away, for Michael enjoyed his own existence
				during these early hours with an intensity that made him feel all his former
				sufferings most benignantly overpaid by his present happiness. Yet in the midst of
				this, tears more than once started to his eyes, as he thought of his mother, and the
				brother he had so entirely loved. His very soul longed to have Edward by his side,
				as various fancies chased each other through his fertile brain; and the image of
				little Fanny, too, with her soft reasoning eyes, as she used to look at him when
				preaching patience at the Deep Valley Mill, as he fondly laboured to recall it, made
				him sigh in the midst of his pleasure and his freedom, to think how sad it was that
				all he had ever loved should have passed away from his eyes for ever. </p>
			<p>But amidst the million proofs of tender commiseration for the sufferings, incident of
				necessity, to our place in creation (which those who run may read, if they are not
				very great dunces indeed), there is, perhaps, none more remarkable than the gradual
				softening of the agony which all who survive what they love, are doomed to feel. The
				state which follows, though as sad as the darkness of the lonely night, made visible
				by the pale backward glances of the parting moon, has the same soothing stillness
				too. Passion is over, anxiety at rest, and we feel more than consoled, we feel
				joyful, as we remember that we too shall pass away, and follow them.</p>
			<p>The journey to Ashleigh cost Michael three days' smart walking, but his pockets were
				no longer in the condition they had been at the time of his never-to-be-forgotten
				escape from The Deep Valley. He had proved himself a good and faithful servant, and
				the worthy yeoman paid him accordingly, so that he had wherewithal to recruit his
				spirits and his strength as he jogged along, and reached the hospitable Nag's Head
				in his native town on the third evening, rather the better than the worse for his
				pleasant toil.</p>
			<p> His first walk on the following morning was to Ashleigh churchyard; but here he was
				obliged to content himself by knowing that the dear relics of those he wished to
				honour were near him; for, of course, the only indication by which he could guess
				whereabouts these <pb n="307"/> precious relics lay, was to be found in the want of
				all memorial. On the sunny side of Ashleigh churchyard, a number of handsome
				tombstones may be seen; many a massive monument is there, protected by its strong
				and stately rail; and thereon may be read, by those who list, the important fact
				that some one who bore a Christian appellation, lies below. To the north, where the
				grass grows strongest, though the sun never comes to cheer it, are a multitude of
				little nameless, unclaimed hillocks, closely wedged together, and rarely showing
				even a withy-band across the swelling sod, to testify that some one has cared for
				what lay hidden under it. To this green republic Michael turned himself, and knew
				full surely that it was there his mother lay. Another, though even as humble as
				himself, might, under similar feelings, have addressed inquiries to the
				parish-sexton, and endeavoured to set his memory to work as to the exact spot where
				he had buried her — but this Michael dared not do; for it would be at once losing
				the advantage of his incognito, and laying himself very needlessly open to the
				danger of being reclaimed by his old enemy, Sir Matthew, as a bound apprentice, who
				had run away. So he contented himself with walking carefully, and with reverential
				tread, through and amongst the many grassy mounds, permitting his tears to flow
				freely as he thought of Teddy, and the dear gentle mother who had so equally loved
				them both; and then turned slowly away, following a path that brought him at the
				distance of a mile or so to Brookford factory. </p>
			<p>The sensation which he felt when the great many-eyed monster first met his sight, was
				one of unmixed pleasure. He literally hugged himself, and blessed the freedom of his
				limbs, the firm and healthy action of his pulse, and the delicious consciousness
				that he was no man's slave.</p>
			<p>For many minutes he stood still to enjoy this; and as his eyes perused line after
				line of the dusky smoke-stained windows, and recalled the early sufferings he had
				endured within them, his very heart swelled with gratitude for the change, and he
				blessed God aloud. But as he approached nearer, and perceived the dim shadowy
				figures slowly moving here and there, and thought upon the condition of each of
				them, he almost repented of his selfish joy, and blamed the ecstasy that for a while
				had made him so utterly forget that thousands were imprisoned still, though he was
				free.</p>
			<p>On, and on, he walked with his eyes immovably fixed upon the hideous fabric till,
				sooner than he expected it, he stood before the gates. He had connived no previous
				plan by which to enter it, and knew that without some specific business, real or
				feigned, it would be impossible; but while he stood weighing the danger of possible
				discovery against his very strong inclination to see what alteration time had made
				in the troop within — whether he should recognise any among them — and whether his
				old tyrant, Parsons, was still their chief, — the gates opened, and one of the
				engine-men, a grizzly fellow, whom he well remembered when his sable hair was
				somewhat less silvered, came forth.</p>
			<p> He gave Michael a look, that very plainly said, "What do <hi>you</hi> want?" <pb n="308"/> and in truth, his neat appearance, unstained skin, and free
				unshrinking eye, very naturally suggested the idea that he could have no business
				there. </p>
			<p>"Is Mr. Parsons within?" said Michael boldly, and daring the inquiry as much because
				he knew not what to say, as from any deliberate resolution to do so.</p>
			<p>"Yes," replied the man; "he is about the place somewhere, I seed him not more than
				ten minutes ago."</p>
			<p>Michael nodded his head, and walked through the gate into the court, across which he
				had passed in trembling a thousand times. Nor was he now quite free from a slight
				feeling of alarm at the idea of meeting the sharp eyes of his former terrible
				taskmaster, and felt much inclined to blame himself for the curious temerity which
				had brought him so nearly within his gripe. But it was too late to retreat, for at
				the distance of a dozen yards he saw Parsons before him, coming forth from the
				building into the court. On seeing the stranger he immediately approached him;
				Michael touched his hat.</p>
			<p>"What may your business here be, young man?" said Parsons eyeing him from top to
				toe.</p>
			<p>"I called in, sir, to inquire whether you happened to want a spinner, and what the
				wages may be," said Michael.</p>
			<p>"Is it for yourself?" demanded Parsons, knitting his brows, and looking at him with a
				sort of incredulous sneer.</p>
			<p>"Why, no sir, it is for a kinsman who happens to be out of employ," replied Michael,
				colouring from the unusual consciousness of deceit, and from the same cause casting
				his eyes upon the ground, thereby displaying the remarkable length of his black
				eyelashes, and giving to his whole countenance a look much more resembling that of
				former days, than he had worn when he first entered.</p>
			<p>Parsons looked at him with a sort of vague idea that he had seen him before.</p>
			<p>"Where do you come from?" said he.</p>
			<p>"From Westmorland, sir. I have been living in service there for these four years
				past."</p>
			<p>"And pray what may your name be?"</p>
			<p>"Robert Thornton, sir," replied Michael, blushing again, as he thus unceremoniously
				borrowed the appellation of his worthy master.</p>
			<p>"Have you ever worked in a factory yourself?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir, I have, when I was a boy," said Michael, from mere want of skill and
				hardihood in the art of lying.</p>
			<p>"And you think you have bettered yourself, I suppose, with your fine buff waistcoat,
				and the rest of it. No we don't want no spinners here."</p>
			<p>Michael by no means unwillingly obeyed this dismissal, and walked away, more than
				half ashamed of his achievement.</p>
			<p> "If I didn't know that Michael Armstrong was dead, I should swear that there chap
				was him," said a girl somewhat older than our imprudent masquerader, and who had
				been watching him very earnestly during the foregoing conversation. The observation
				was not <pb n="309"/> addressed to the overlooker, but to another girl, who had
				brought the speaker her dinner to prevent her leaving some particular work on which
				she was employed. </p>
			<p>"What's that you say, Sykes?" said Parsons, turning quickly towards her.</p>
			<p>"I was saying, sir, as that boy was unaccountable like Michael Armstrong, as used to
				live in mother's back-kitchen. He wasn't above a year or two younger than me, and I
				knowed him as well as I did my own brothers."</p>
			<p>"Stuff and nonsense, girl! All the world knows that young rascal died years ago; and
				fuss enough there was made about it by that mad miss at Milford, who I suppose,
				found out that she was their cousin, or something of the sort, for she took it so to
				heart, that she sold her house and lands, and ran away with another of 'em to some
				foreign country, for fear he should die too. Sure you must mind all that queer
				story?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir," replied the girl; "I remember it right well, and that's the reason why I
				says that I know it can't be him."</p>
			<p>"Yet upon my soul, now you mention it, he was the very image of him. I fancied as I
				looked at him that sure-ly I had seen him somewhere before. But it can't be — a dead
				dog is dead, all the world over."</p>
			<p>"Yes sure, sir," responded Kitty Sykes, who being what is called a very sightly girl,
				was not unfrequently indulged with a little condescending notice from Mr. Parsons.
				"But 'twas his queer curly black hair, and his particular-looking eyes as put it
				into my head."</p>
			<p>"And if you go on talking of it, Sykes, in that way, you will be putting it into my
				head too. And after all, there is nothing so very impossible in it. Nobody in these
				parts could really know much about it, you see, and there's no reason, as I can
				tell, why the scamp might not have run away from the Deep — that is, the
				stocking-weaver's manufactory as he was sent 'printice to, and they as ought to have
				stopped him, might have given out that he was dead," replied the overlooker.</p>
			<p>"Then if it <hi>was</hi> possible," resumed Kitty Sykes, "I wouldn't mind taking my
				bodily oath that that there young fellow was Michael Armstrong, and nobody
				else."</p>
			<p>"Egad, I wish I hadn't let him go!" cried Parsons, running to the gates. "He was
				'printiced till twenty-one, and if he has run away, he's liable to be taken up and
				put in prison, by the first as catches him."</p>
			<p>Kitty Sykes took the liberty of running to the gates also; but to say the truth, she
				had no wish at all that Mr. Parsons should catch him up, and put him into prison.
				The girl, though she had prudence enough not to communicate the opinion to her
				friend Mr. Parsons, thought the stranger by far the handsomest young fellow she had
				ever seen, and secretly determined. if she could catch sight of him again, that she
				would give him a hint to keep clear of his old acquaintance.</p>
			<pb n="310"/>
			<p>"There he goes," cried Parsons, watching Michael, as with upright gait, and rapid
				strides, he was pursuing his way by the well-remembered path, which led from the
				factory to Dowling Lodge. "There he goes! He don't look like one of the mill-people
				any way — and yet the fellow said that he had worked in a factory. Didn't you hear
				him, Kitty?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir," replied the girl, "and it was just then as I felt so unaccountable sure
				that, unless it was out and out impossible, it must be Michael Armstrong as was
				speaking. I never did see such eyes a Michael's, nor such hair neither."</p>
			<p>"And there he goes, I'll bet a sovereign," rejoined the overlooker, "to take a look
				at his old quarters at the Lodge. Kitty, I'll give you a glass of gin and a
				shilling, if you'll run after him — you can run like a hare, I know — run and bring
				him back, Kitty, there's a darling, and say as I have got some good news to tell
				him."</p>
			<p>Off started the girl with right good-will, having her own reasons for wishing to do
				the errand, as well as a very sufficient inclination to gain the promised
				reward.</p>
			<p>Mr. Parsons by no means over-rated her running powers; and had she been less fleet,
				she would have failed in her object, for Michael walked briskly, and without any
				inclination to remain longer in the vicinity of the mill, though by no means
				conscious that he had been recognised.</p>
			<p>He had just turned the corner of a hedge when the girl overtook him, so that their
				colloquy did not take place within sight of the overlooker.</p>
			<p>Michael heard the fair Kitty's approach, and turned to see who it was that thus came
				galloping and panting after him.</p>
			<p>"Do you want me, young woman?" said he, civilly stopping for her.</p>
			<p>"Well then, you are no changeling!" replied the girl, laying her hand on his arm;
				"you were always out-and-out, the civilest boy in the mill."</p>
			<p>A very bright suffusion dyed the clear brown of Michael's cheek as he heard this.</p>
			<p>"I do not know what you mean!" he replied.</p>
			<p>"Come, come, Michael Armstrong," rejoined Kitty, "you needn't be afraid of me. Don't
				you remember Kitty Sykes, as have gone to and from the mill with you and Teddy, a
				hundred and a hundred times?"</p>
			<p>"Is it indeed Kitty Sykes, grown into such a handsome young woman?" said Michael,
				holding out his hand to her, and feeling quite incapable of preserving his
				incognito, in the presence of so old an acquaintance. "And to think of your knowing
				me, Kitty! But you must not betray me, my dear girl. If I was found out for Michael
				Armstrong, I might get into a scrape."</p>
			<p> "And that's true, and no lie," answered the faithless ambassadress, "for I am sent
				after you by that old beast Parsons, to tell you to come back, because he had good
				news for you. But his news would just <pb n="311"/> be to give you notice to march
				into prison for having run away; and I agreed to carry his message for him. He
				thinks that I delight in him, the old monster! but I'd rather walk a mile to do a
				kindness to you Michael, than stir an inch, to please him." </p>
			<p>"God bless you, my dear girl! I hope you have done me a great service now; for I
				think I could show him leg bail, that he would find it difficult to refuse, Kitty.
				So now good by, old friend; I am sorry to part so soon, but it won't do to stay here
				to be caught, will it?"</p>
			<p>"No, truly, Mike! I'd be loath to see any friend of mine at his mercy, or at that of
				his master either. But you won't go clear away out of the country without seeing me
				again, will you? You needn't be feared of him, 'twill be easy enough to put him off
				the scent. I'll back, and tell that we was both of us altogether deceived, and that
				you bean't no more Michael Armstrong than he be."</p>
			<p>"I don't think I ought to stay in Ashleigh now, Kitty; there's others may know me as
				well as you and he, and 'twould be a terrible change, I can tell you, my dear girl,
				to come down from the hills where I am tending a good master's sheep, and often feel
				so high and so happy, that I think I am halfway to heaven — it would be a terrible
				change, Kitty, to come from that, into the Deep Valley Mill again, which is as much
				worse than our old factory here, as hanging is worse than whipping!"</p>
			<p>"Lord have mercy upon 'em, then!" ejaculated the poor girl. "But I say, Michael, you
				needn't run no risk at all, if I go back and say as it isn't you, and then you might
				meet me after nightfall, in the town."</p>
			<p>"It will not be very long, Kitty, before I am one-and-twenty, and a free man, and
				it's then, please Heaven, that I'll come back again, and pay the old place a visit.
				You have been kind enough to remember me so long, that I don't think you'll have
				forgotten me by that time, and it shall go hard with me but I'll bring you a token
				from some of our north-country fairs." So saying, he gave the damsel a kiss, and she
				wrung his hand without making any further effort to detain him.</p>
			<p>"God bless you!" said the retreating Michael, over his shoulder.</p>
			<p>"And God bless you, too, you nice boy! muttered poor Kitty. "I wouldn't ask no better
				luck, than just to follow you, and keep sheep too."</p>
			<p>Either from wishing to look after him as ong as he was in sight, or for the purpose
				of giving him law, in case Mr. Parsons should determine on pursuit, Kitty Sykes
				remained stationary on the spot where Michael left her, till, abandoning his hardy
				project of a visit to Dowling Lodge, he had stretched far away over the fields
				towards the road he was to pursue northwards to his peaceful home; and then she
				walked leisurely back to the factory, where, after a sharp reproof for staying so
				long, and a pert reply to it, she informed the overlooker that they had both been
				wrong, but that the young lad said he might be found if he was wanted, at the sign
				of the Magpie, that was about a mile on the road towards London.</p>
			<p> Warned by this unexpected recognition, Michael determined to run <pb n="312"/> no
				more risks among his townfolks; but not being disposed to lose the little bundle he
				had deposited at the Nag's Head, he ensconced himself within the shelter of a small
				public-house, on the road-side, resolved to wait there till the evening set in, and
				then to venture back to his last night's lodging, pay his bill, reclaim his bundle,
				and set forth upon a night-march, which he hoped would take him beyond all danger of
				Mr. Parsons, before the following morning. </p>
			<p>Having secured his welcome by the usual ceremony of ordering a meal, Michael looked
				about him for some means of occupation during the hours which he had doomed himself
				to pass there, and in despair of finding any better literary amusement, seized upon
				a heap of handbills, of a vast variety of external forms, but having, as he found
				upon examination, one and all the same object, namely, the calling together a
				general meeting of the whole county of York (then undivided), for the purpose of
				signing a petition to parliament for a law, limiting the hours of labour in
				factories to ten hours a day. Michael Armstrong was no longer a factory operative;
				free as the air he breathed upon his beloved mountain-tops, he no longer trembled at
				the omnipotent frown of an overlooker, nor sickened as he watched the rising sun
				that was to set again long hours before his stifling labour ceased. All this was
				over and ended with him for ever. Yet did his heart throb, and his eye kindle as he
				perused page after page of the arousing call which summoned tens of thousands, nay
				hundreds of thousands to use the right their country vested in them, of imploring
				mercy and justice from the august tripartite power that ruled the land.</p>
			<p>Very powerful was the male and simple eloquence with which many of these unpretending
				compositions appealed to the paternal feelings of those they addressed; and such
				terribly true representations were found among them of the well-remembered agonies
				of his boyhood, that Michael was fain to put his spread hand before his face to
				conceal the emotions they produced.</p>
			<p>He had sat in this situation for some minutes, revolving both his former sufferings,
				and the blessedness of his present release from them, when a man, who had been
				quietly sitting writing at a distant window, but had nevertheless found leisure to
				watch Michael's countenance as he proceeded with his examination of the handbills,
				rose from his place, and gently approaching him said, in deep, yet very gentle
				voice, "You seem moved by the perusal of these papers, my good friend. Is it the
				first time you have met with them?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, indeed, sir, it is," replied Michael, starting from his revery.</p>
			<p>"Then I presume you are a stranger in this part of the country?"</p>
			<p>"Why, yes, sir; the master I serve is a Westmorland statesman, and I am only come
				this way upon a holiday trip."</p>
			<p>"Then maybe you don't care enough for the poor factory operatives to join their
				meeting, and put your name to their petition?"</p>
			<p>"If caring for them could do them any good, master," replied Michael, warmly, "they
				would be in no want of help, as long as I was near them. But I don't think the name
				of a poor servant-boy like me, could do them either honour or service."</p>
			<pb n="313"/>
			<p>"Then what sort of names, my good lad, do you suppose will support this petition. Do
				you think the great mill-owners will sign it? — Do you think such men as Sir Matthew
				Dowling for instance, whom you may have heard spoken of, down at Ashleigh, maybe, do
				you think it will be such as he, whose first object in life is to get as many hours
				of labour out of the little creatures that work for him, as stripes can make them
				give, do you think it will be such as he, that will sign the ten hours bill?"</p>
			<p>"Not if that bill is either to hurt himself, or better the children, I should think,"
				said Michael.</p>
			<p>"True enough," replied his new acquaintance, "and not only is that true, but he and
				the like of him will do all that mortal men can, to prevent all others from signing
				it. But Heaven forbid they should succeed, young man — for if they do, the best hope
				of many thousand suffering, and most helpless human beings, will fall to the
				ground!"</p>
			<p>"Then, indeed, may Heaven forbid that they should have their will!" returned Michael,
				fervently. "When is this meeting to take place?" he added, turning his eyes again to
				the papers he still held in his hand. "But three days hence! — truly I should like
				to witness it!"</p>
			<p>"Is there any reason against your doing it?" demanded the stranger. "Will your
				services be wanted by your master before that time?"</p>
			<p>"He won't expect me, till two or three days after it," replied Michael; "I have done
				all I wanted — at least I have stayed as long as I wished at Ashleigh, and I don't
				see any great harm there would be in witnessing the meeting."</p>
			<p>"Do see it, my good lad!" said the stranger; "I predict that it will offer a
				spectacle such as never was witnessed before, and most likely never will, or can be
				seen, again. A multitude, probably amounting to above a hundred thousand overworked
				operatives, will meet in peace and good order, to petition for legal relief from the
				oppression of a system which has brought them to a lower state of degradation and
				misery than any to which human beings have ever been brought before. Were those in
				whom these poor people have confidence, less deeply anxious to preserve the public
				peace than they are, a different mode of redress might be sought for. But as it is,
				an honest man may venture to advise such a respectable young fellow as you seem to
				be, to stretch your good master's leave a little, in order to be present at this
				great spectacle."</p>
			<p>A good deal more conversation followed on the same theme, and ere Michael had ceased
				to listen to his companion, he felt convinced that duty as well as inclination would
				lead him to do all that a loyal subject and peaceable citizen could, in aid of the
				suffering class from whose ranks he had so miraculously escaped. In a word, Michael
				Armstrong determined to attend the great Yorkshire meeting, and hold up his hand for
				the ten hours bill.</p>
			<p> The extraordinary circumstances attending that enormous meeting; the
					<hi>unaccountable</hi> disappointments which at every halting-place attended all
				the precautionary efforts of the committee to procure bread <pb n="314"/> for the
				multitude, while beer was every where found ready, and in the greatest abundance;
				the terror felt by those most interested, lest heat, fatigue, exhaustion, and beer,
				together, might lead to some disturbance of the peace; and the triumphant influence
				of reason and kindness joined, in inducing the hungry multitude to separate
				peaceably, are already matters of history, and the narrative must therefore adhere
				to the fortunes of its hero, without dwelling upon nobler themes. </p>
			<p>In returning to Ashleigh for his bundle, Michael took good care to be as little seen
				as possible; he was in fact more than ever anxious to avoid detection, as the more
				he meditated on his recollections of Sir Matthew Dowling and Parsons, the more did
				he feel convinced that should he fall into their power before the age of twenty-one,
				matters would go very hard with him.</p>
			<p>At the great assembling of the people at York, he feared not that he should encounter
				any enemy; the only human beings whom he could so designate being likely to show
				themselves at the most distant part of the kingdom, rather than before the face of
				the multitude to be expected there. No feelings of distrust or alarm, therefore,
				arose to check the pleasurable excitement which this expedition was calculated to
				inspire; and Michael, with his stout staff over his shoulder, and the cotton
				handkerchief, containing a change of linen, suspended from it, set out with a light
				heart and active step upon a walk in which he soon found himself joined by many
				thousand companions.</p>
			<p>The assurance given him by his unknown acquaintance, that he should see a wonderful
				and spirit-stirring spectacle, was fully verified. The very sight of the road along
				which he travelled, which looked like a dark and mighty current moving irresistibly
				along, while tributary streams flowed into it on all sides, so thick and serried was
				the mass that moved along it, was of itself well worth the toil it cost him, to
				behold its peaceful tumult. From time to time Michael indulged in a little
				questioning of the various individuals beside whom he found himself; but for the
				most part the men were too intent upon the object of their expedition, to converse
				idly respecting it — and by degrees our hero grew as silent as the rest, and trudged
				on without any other communion than that of his own thoughts.</p>
			<p>It was at about twenty miles distance from York, when the multitude were on their
				return, that a circumstance occurred, which, being of considerable importance to
				Michael, must be detailed somewhat at length. He had entered an inn by the
				road-side, which, being one of the largest post-houses on the north road, had an air
				of pretension and costliness about it, that caused the great majority of the host to
				walk on, without venturing to approach precincts so dangerous.</p>
			<p>But Michael was much exhausted, and having already discovered, when passing before
				the humbler houses of public entertainment, that no rest could be hoped from
				entering them, every inch of space being occupied, he deemed it wisest to disburse a
				splendid shilling, rather than fag on till he had no strength to go further.</p>
			<p> In pursuance of this reasoning, he entered the kitchen of the Royal Oak, and called
				for bread, cheese, and a pint of beer. Though there <pb n="315"/> were not many of
				his fellow-travellers either rich or extravagant enough to share these splendid
				quarters with him, there were, nevertheless, three or four men taking refreshment in
				the apartment. One of these, an elderly respectable-looking personage, who had, as
				it seemed, exclusive possession of a snug little round-table in a corner, made a
				sign to Michael to share it with him. This was gratefully accepted, the loaf and
				cheese were already there, and the foaming tankard quickly followed. </p>
			<p>"I marked you at the meeting," said his sociable companion. "It did my heart good to
				see a sprinkling here and there of them that come out of pure love and kindness to
				their poor fellow-creatures, having nothing themselves to gain. 'Tis a pity and a
				sin too, that so many Englishmen stand idly by, when such a business as this is
				afoot, just as if they had nothing to do with it. But they are one and all mistaken,
				and that they may chance to find out, too, one of these days."</p>
			<p>"You give me credit for more than I deserve, perhaps," replied Michael; "that is, if
				you think my heart was enough with the poor factory-folks to make me take a long
				roundabout to sign with them, without having had some knowledge of their sufferings
				myself. You are right in thinking that I am not one of them now; but I have been,
				and Heaven forbid I should ever forget it! for the keeping that time mind, is quite
				enough to make every thing that comes to me now seem light and easy."</p>
			<p>"You have worked in a factory?" said the other in an accent of surprise; "I should
				never have guessed as much — but you are very right to be thankful for the present,
				instead of ashamed for the past. But I don't think," he added, eyeing the fine
				person of Michael from head to foot, "I don't think I ever saw a lad who showed so
				little signs of having suffered in health and limb from it. Some lucky accident must
				have taken you away early?"</p>
			<p>"I have seen many a boy and girl crippled for life," replied Michael, "before they
				were as old as I was when I ran away."</p>
			<p>"My good fellow," whispered his companion, "don't you use them words again. You are
				safe with me, I promise you; but if you ran from indentures, you won't do wisely to
				tell of it."</p>
			<p>"You must blame your own kind and friendly looks," said Michael, smiling; "I know
				well enough that what you say is true, and it isn't a thing I should have told to
				many. But excepting just now that I took a fancy to come back, and take a look about
				the old place where I was born, I have got so clear and clean away from mills and
				mill-owners, that I have grown rather bolder, maybe, than I ought to be. My business
				now, thank Heaven! is sheep-tending upon the beautiful free hills of
				Westmorland."</p>
			<p>"You may well be thankful for such a change," replied his friendly companion. "It
				must have been some unaccountable good luck; for in general, a runaway factory
				'prentice is hunted down and caught long before he has got among the good
				hill-folks."</p>
			<p> "It was, indeed, a blessed chance for me!" said Michael, with deep <pb n="316"/>
				feeling. "I fell into the hands of the best man and the best master that ever a
				wretched runaway hit upon." </p>
			<p>"I almost wonder at you then venturing to come within sight of your own place again.
				You can't be one-and-twenty yet by your looks, and you would not over-well like to
				work out your time in a factory, I should think," said the other.</p>
			<p>"I don't think I should," replied Michael, laughing; "and I have run some risk, I
				promise you, already, of the very thing you talk of, since I left my master's house.
				Nothing would content my foolish fancy for calling back old times, but going to look
				at the very factory where I first worked, and talking to the identical tyrant who
				tortured me there."</p>
			<p>"But he did not know you, I hope?" said the old man.</p>
			<p>"I can hardly say that he did not," replied Michael; "for some notion or other came
				into his head, and after I left him he sent for me to come back again. It was,
				however, by a friendly messenger who knew well enough who I was, and gave me pretty
				plainly to understand which way I had better walk — and that was good luck again.
				But I was sorry, too, to have to turn away from the old place without learning any
				news of my former acquaintance. I found the same overlooker at Sir Matthew Dowling's
				mill, and that was all I could find out."</p>
			<p>"Sir Matthew Dowling's mill at Ashleigh? that's my country, too. My wife keeps a
				school at Milford," replied the man, "and we have heard enough of Sir Matthew."</p>
			<p>"Can you tell me any thing about his daughter Martha?" demanded Michael, with the
				appearance of being greatly interested in the inquiry. "She was very kind to me, and
				I loved her next best, I think, to my own dear mother and brother. Do you happen to
				know any thing about her?"</p>
			<p>"Not just at present," replied the man; "though they do say, that all the family are
				likely to have a downfal, owing to Sir Matthew's getting into a scrape about bad
				bills, or something or other, t'other side of the water. But I do well remember
				something particular about Miss Martha that you talk of, a matter of seven years
				ago; and if she was good to you, it was more than she was to every body, for it was
				all along of a cruel piece of treachery of hers, that I lost the best mistress that
				ever man had. I dare say, if you come from Ashleigh, you must know the name of Miss
				Brotherton, though it's long since she left Milford. I was her coachman, and if it
				had not been for Miss Martha Dowling, I believe I might have been so still."</p>
			<p>"I was but just turned ten years old, at the time I knew Miss Martha," returned
				Michael; "but I shouldn't have thought she could be treacherous to any body."</p>
			<p>"She was though, for all our people knew the whole story from first to last, and a
				queer story it was too, when one thinks of the end of it; which was neither more nor
				less than sending our dear young lady away out of the country."</p>
			<p> "I never happened to know any thing about the lady who owned the <pb n="317"/>
				park," replied Michael; "except that she was one of the fine folks as I have seen at
				Dowling Lodge, but I should like to hear the story, because of Miss Martha." </p>
			<p>"Why the short and the long of it was, that there was a poor widow called Armstrong —
				"</p>
			<p>Michael started so violently, that his companion stopped.</p>
			<p>"Did you happen to know her, my lad?" he added, after a pause.</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir, I remember her very well — but please to go on."</p>
			<p>"Well then, this widow Armstrong had two sons, and one of them was had up to the
				great house, Dowling Lodge, I mean, for some nonsensical reason or other; and Sir
				Matthew pretended to make the greatest fuss in the world about him, and the whole
				country was talking about it. But for some offence of the poor boy's, I never
				rightly heard what, the old sinner determined upon sending him 'prentice to the most
				infernal place, by all account, that the earth has got to be ashamed of. And how do
				you think the poor widow was coaxed over to sign the indentures? Why by your friend,
				Miss Martha, and no one else, and that I know upon the best authority. Well, 'tis a
				long story, the ins and outs of it, and I can't say that I ever rightly understood
				the whole, but this I know to be fact: that our young mistress took the whole thing
				so much to heart, that she actually set out to look after the boy; but when she got
				to the murderous place the poor little fellow was dead! And what did she do then,
				dear, tender-hearted lady! but bring back a pretty little girl instead of him,
				because, as we all guessed, she was determined to save somebody."</p>
			<p>The emotion of Michael Armstrong on hearing this, was so entirely beyond his power to
				conquer, that he lost all capability of utterance, and instead of asking the name of
				the little girl — an inquiry which he in vain strove to make — he sat pale and
				gasping, with his eyes fixed on the speaker, and every limb trembling.</p>
			<p>"The Lord have mercy on us! what is the matter with you, my good fellow?" said Miss
				Brotherton's <hi>ci-devant</hi> coachman. "You look cruel bad! Is it my tale as
				turns you so? or is it that you have walked too much and too fast?"</p>
			<p>"No, no, no! <hi>Pray</hi> go on!" murmured Michael, making a strong effort to
				articulate.</p>
			<p>"'Tis the story, then? and you knowed the poor Armstrongs, beyond all doubt!" said
				the kind-hearted coachman. "Well then, you shall hear the end of it. When my
				mistress brought back the news of the little fellow's death, his poor mother, who
				was but a sickly, cripply sort of body, just broke her heart and died; whereupon
				Miss Brotherton took home the other boy, put him to school to my wife, and then took
				to teaching him herself, and treated him for all the world as if he had been her own
				brother; and then she began to fancy that he wanted a doctor — "</p>
			<p>"And then," groaned Michael, suddenly interrupting him, — "and then he died!"</p>
			<p> "You don't say so?" said the coachman, in an accent of regret. "Did he indeed, poor
				boy? Well now, I'm sorry for that; for it was a pleasure to see him growing taller
				and stouter every day, almost, as <pb n="318"/> one may say. And when was it he
				died? It's curious that we should never have heard of it." </p>
			<p>"Heard of it?" said Michael, while a sort of wild uncertainty took possession of his
				mind, that gave him the feeling of one whose reason threatened to leave him. "Heard
				it? Why did you want to hear it? Could you not see it, and know it, if he was living
				in the same house with you?"</p>
			<p>"For certain I could, if he had died while Miss Brotherton remained at the park; but
				that he did not, for I drove him off the first stage myself, alive and well, and
				looking as beautiful as he always did, poor lad, for he was to be sure the
				handsomest-faced boy, that ever I looked upon. But what might have happened to him
				afterwards, is of course more than I can say; for when the place was sold, and all
				of us paid off, all we heard was, that our dear young lady was set off to travel in
				foreign countries, and had left pensions to every one of her servants according to
				their length of service. So we know nothing since."</p>
			<p>"Is there no one can tell me where she is gone, and in what land my brother died?"
				said Michael, violently agitated.</p>
			<p>"Your brother?" said his companion. "Who do you mean by your brother, my lad?"</p>
			<p>"Teddy! — my brother Edward! — I am Michael Armstrong!" was the convulsive reply.</p>
			<p>"God bless my heart and soul! And you be the boy as Miss Brotherton went to look
				after? And she got into the wrong box, then, about your being dead? Was there ever
				any thing like that? But who was it, my boy, that told you as your brother was
				dead?"</p>
			<p>"A woman in Ashleigh — one living in the house where my mother died. She told me that
				my mother was dead, and my brother too."</p>
			<p>"Did she know who she was speaking to? Did she know you was Michael Armstrong?" said
				the old coachman with quickness.</p>
			<p>"No, she knew me not," replied Michael; "but she knew that the widow Armstrong and
				her boy were dead."</p>
			<p>"Then I'll be hanged if I believe as your brother <hi>is</hi> dead," replied the
				other eagerly. "When she said the widow's boy, she meant you, I'll lay my life on
				it; and there is nobody in Ashleigh, if they had told of her death, but would have
				named that of her boy too; but it would have always been meaning you, because every
				body knew that one followed close upon the news of the other. And I don't believe
				that your brother's dead, and that's a fact."</p>
			<p>Michael clasped his hands rigidly together, and closing his eyes, remained so long
				motionless, that his good-natured companion became alarmed, and laying his hand upon
				the poor lad's arm, shook him gently, as he said, "Any how, my good fellow, there is
				no cause for you to break your heart with thinking about it all. Talking about your
				poor mother, and her love of you, has made you turn as pale as a sheet; and natural
				enough, too, perhaps. But my notion that your brother is alive and well, ought to
				comfort you — oughtn't it?"</p>
			<p> Michael opened his eyes, and fixing them on his companion, said, "The joy of it is
				more than I can bear!" and then the tears bursting <pb n="319"/> forth, he wept
				copiously; a timely relief, for which he had great reason to be thankful. </p>
			<p>"Well, well, I don't mind seeing you cry a little — that won't do you no harm; and
				thank goodness your colour is coming back again! I declare I thought I had been the
				death of you," said his new friend. "But I'll tell you something more, and that is
				the name of him as knows more about Miss Brotherton and your brother too, I'll be
				bold to say, than any body in the whole country, and that's Parson Bell, of
				Fairly."</p>
			<p>"And where is Fairly?" said Michael, starting up. "How long shall I be in getting
				there? The hope is only hope yet, you know — there is no certainty. Edward! dear,
				dear, Edward! Is it God's pleasure that I should see him again in this world? Is it
				possible that such a heavenly dream can ever come true? Oh! how often have I sat
				upon the hill and watched the clouds, and thought that he was above them all!"</p>
			<p>"Poor boy! But 'twill be better still, for a few years to come, that he should be
				upon the earth along with you, won't it?"</p>
			<p>"Where is Fairly?" reiterated Michael. "How long shall I be in getting there?"</p>
			<p>"Longer than you'll like, my dear boy," replied the coachman. "It's a good sixteen
				miles from this very house; I should not wonder if they was to charge seventeen, and
				you must not think of trying to compass that to-night, for you are not in any wise
				in a fit condition for it, changing colour, as you do, every minute. Your best
				course will be to rest here for the night, and set off again by times to-morrow
				morning, and that will bring you in easy by about the middle of the day, you
				know."</p>
			<p>"Impossible!" said Michael. "I owe you more than I am able to thank you for, and I
				would be willing to show my gratitude by following your advice — only, sir, I am
				quite sure I could not sleep a wink. And I don't think it would do me any good to
				lie tossing from side to side, unknowing, for certain, whether my own dear Teddy was
				alive or dead! So if you please, I must set off directly, that I may know the best
				and the worst at once."</p>
			<p>"I suppose at your age I should have done the same; therefore I won't pretend to
				quarrel with you for it," replied the good man; "but I suppose it would be just
				prudent to call for an ink-horn, and to set down upon a bit of paper the name of the
				good clergyman that you are to call upon, as well as his place of residence."</p>
			<p>"There is no need of that, sir," said Michael; " <hi>Parson Bell, of Fairly</hi> ,
				are the words you said, and they, as well as all the rest you have spoken, seem as
				if they were stamped upon my very heart. But yet, before I start, I should like to
				use the ink-horn too, that I might write a line or so to my good master. I know he
				will be troubled in his mind about me if I don't get back, and I don't know rightly
				how long it may be. God bless him, good man!" continued Michael; "it was he that had
				me taught to write, and he shan't be left with any doubts or fears upon his mind for
				want of a letter from me."</p>
			<pb n="320"/>
			<p>This was a measure that the coachman greatly approved, and observing that he was well
				known in the house, and sure to be minded, he undertook to order the
				writing-materials, as well as something substantial by way of a supper; declaring
				that though he had come into his young friends wild scheme of walking off straight
				away for Fairly, instead of putting up for the night, either where they were, or at
				Leeds, he should not part with him without a quarrel, if he refused to accept, and
				do justice to the good cheer he should provide. This kindness on the part of the man
				who had so strongly influenced his destiny, was both kindly intentioned and wisely
				devised; for greatly did the agitated young man stand in need of recruited strength
				and tranquillity, before he set off upon a new expedition, which was to lead to
				information so vitally important to his happiness. Though it was somewhat against
				his inclination, he accepted the friendly invitation gratefully, and the materials
				for writing being set before him, he addressed the following epistle to Mr.
				Thornton:</p>
			<quote><p>"Honoured Master!</p>
			<p>"Your goodness to me, in all ways, would make any abuse of it on my part a heavy
				crime indeed — too heavy, I think, for me to commit, or you to suspect me of. But I
				cannot be at the suppertable at Neckerby, on next Saturday night, according to my
				promise. A very strange thing has happened to me, dear master, which may, perhaps,
				come to nothing, and in that case I know you will hear my story, and pity me too
				much to think of anger. But if all I hope comes to pass, your generous heart will
				rejoice with me, and you will bless your own goodness, for bringing me to the
				knowledge of the very greatest joy that ever fell to the lot of a human being, by
				giving me this holiday.</p>
			<p>
				"I am, honoured Master,
			</p>
			<p>"Your faithful and grateful servant, " Michael
					Armstrong. "</p></quote>
			<p>Having finished his letter, and committed it to the post, Michael felt somewhat more
				tranquil, and endeavoured to assume with his new acquaintance an air of greater
				composure, and self-possession. But his heart beat, his temples throbbed, his
				thoughts wandered, and when he and his friendly companion sat down to supper, the
				poor boy felt that he could almost as easily have swallowed the board itself as any
				portion of the substantial fare which was spread upon it. But he quaffed a long and
				refreshing draught from a pitcher of cold water, and putting, at the suggestion of
				the worthy coachman, a crust in his pocket, he sallied forth with the agitating
				consciousness that on the information of which he was in pursuit, hung all his
				earthly hopes.</p>
			<p>His new friend shook his head as he felt his feverish hand, and marked his heightened
				colour, and his eager eye.</p>
			<p> "God bless you, boy!" said the good man. "Remember, if you fall sick by the way,
				that my name is Richard Smithson, that I live at Milford, near Ashleigh, and that
				I'll hold myself ready to come to <pb n="321"/> you at a pinch, if you should happen
				to have need of me. And here, Michael Armstrong, are three sovereigns, that I give
				you to keep for two reasons. One is, that you may use them in case you have need.
				The other, that if you don't want them, I shall be sure to see you, when you bring
				them back, and that you will do, or I'll never trust a lad's face more; and now good
				bye. It is but a wildish sort of boy's trick though, setting off this way at night,
				when you ought to be in bed." </p>
			<p>"The air and the walk will do me more good than all the beds in the world!" replied
				Michael. "God bless you, sir! See me you shall, if I continue to live;" and so
				saying, he strode forth into the night, with a longing for greater space to breathe
				in, than could be found in the kitchen of the Royal-oak.</p>
			<p>The boy was right as to the effect which this bodily exertion would produce upon him.
				The very darkness calmed him; he took his hat off that the cool air might bathe his
				temples with its dewy breath; and though his pace was rapid, and scarcely relaxed
				for a moment during many miles, the action of his pulse became more healthy, and the
				aching of his throbbing temples passed away.</p>
			<p>All he now seemed to fear was that his imagination should cheat him into the
				persuasion that all he wished was true. Edward! Fanny! (for of her identity with
				Miss Brotherton's <hi>protégée</hi> he could hardly doubt, when he remembered the
				history of her departure from the Deep Valley) — these names seemed to ring in his
				ears, and to be inscribed in starlight on the heavens as he raised his eyes towards
				them. And thus the sixteen miles were traversed before he had half chewed the cud of
				all the sweet thoughts that thronged upon his fancy. When he reached Fairly, it was
				still much too early to find any one stirring, so Michael unceremoniously walked
				into a cart-shed, and clambering up into a vehicle that had the sweet savour of
				newly-carried hay to recommend it, he placed his bundle under his head, and despite
				both hopes and fears, fell into a sound sleep, nor waked till cocks, hens, cows,
				pigs, and ploughboys, all joined in chorus to arouse him.</p>
		</div><div type="chapter">
			<head> CHAPTER XXVIII. </head>
			<p>AN IMPORTANT INTERVIEW — DOUBTS AND FEARS.</p>
			<p>
				Michael's first recollections on opening his eyes were not of the
				clearest kind, and it required at least a minute's looking about him, after seating
				himself upright in the cart, before he could perfectly understand where he was, or
				why and how he got there. But no sooner did all the events of the day before rush
				back upon his mind, <pb n="322"/> than he felt conscious of being near the most
				important moment of his life. Again he closed his eyes, but not to sleep, and
				fervently prayed that whatever might be the tidings which awaited him, he might have
				strength to receive and bear them as he ought. Then, springing from his
				resting-place upon the ground, he inquired of a lad near him the way to Mr. Bell's,
				and set off to follow the directions he received with no greater delay than was
				necessary for a short halt beside a little streamlet on the way, which offered a
				welcome opportunity of washing his face and hands before he petitioned for admission
				to the presence of the good clergyman, to whose words he looked forward with an
				intensity of interest which almost amounted to agony. </p>
			<p>Though it was still early, Mr. Bell was already in his garden, and when the gate
				opened, it was himself who turned towards it to learn the errand of the young
				stranger. Michael felt at the first glance that the gentleman who stood before him
				was the person from whom he was to learn whether the brother he had so long mourned
				as dead was still alive, and he trembled so violently from head to foot that he
				could not articulate a word.</p>
			<p>"What ails you, my lad?" said Mr. Bell, gently laying a hand upon his shoulder, and
				looking earnestly in his face. "You have not the look of one who has done mischief,
				or else I could fancy that you had some terrible tale to tell. Come into the house
				and sit down, my boy, for it is very clear you are not quite able to stand."</p>
			<p>Michael, still silent, followed his considerate host into the house, and thankfully
				received from his hands a glass of water, which did him good service, for in a
				minute or two he was able to say, "I want you to tell me, sir — may God give me
				strength to hear your answer, let it be which way it may! — I want to know — if
				Edward — if my brother, Edward Armstrong, is alive or dead?" But notwithstanding
				Michael's torturing eagerness to hear the answer, he put his hand before his eyes,
				because he had not courage to bear the look that might forestal it.</p>
			<p>"Your brother? Edward Armstrong your brother? Who then are you, boy, in the name of
				Heaven?" said Mr. Bell, eagerly.</p>
			<p>"I am Michael, sir, Michael Armstrong. But oh! for pity's sake, tell me what I
				ask!"</p>
			<p>"Yes, boy, yes. But compose yourself, my dear fellow! Edward is alive, and your
				friend Fanny Fletcher too."</p>
			<p>Michael sunk from his chair upon his knees, and lifting his clasped hands towards
				Heaven, seemed breathing thanksgivings for this assured confirmation of tidings
				which, till now, he had not dared to believe true. But, startled as he was, the
				anxiety, the excitement, and the fatigue of the preceding night and day, had been
				more than enough for him, and at the moment when every thought would have been joy,
				and every sensation delight, he ceased to think or feel at all, — the colour forsook
				his lips, his eyes closed, and, greatly to the dismay of Mr. Bell, he sunk prostrate
				on the floor.</p>
			<p> No time was lost before the usual means of restoring suspended life were
				administered; and the uncared-for factory-boy, the mountain-braced <pb n="323"/>
				Westmorland shepherd, lay extended on a sofa, with essences at his nose, and the
				opening of his dark eyes watched for, as tenderly as if he had been a delicate young
				lady. </p>
			<p>A deep-drawn sigh announced to Mr. Bell, who stood by, anxiously watching him, that
				his remedies had been successful, that the boy so long mourned as dead, was really
				and truly alive, and a very handsome, well-grown fellow into the bargain.</p>
			<p>"This is a strange history, Michael, as ever I chanced to hear," said he, taking the
				boy's hand, and ascertaining that his pulse again made 'healthful music.' "Why we
				have all been mourning for you as dead for this many a year, and now you drop down,
				as if from the clouds, and by what I can make out, have been fancying on your side
				that Edward was dead too. The first thing to do, must, I think, be to give you some
				breakfast, and then, if you are strong enough, you shall tell me how all this has
				come to pass."</p>
			<p>Full as his heart was, and eagerly as he longed for the conversation in which he had
				so much to learn, as well as to tell, Michael gratefully submitted to this
				arrangement, till having received from the hands of the deeply-interested Mrs. Bell
				herself the refreshment he so greatly needed, he felt his young strength return, and
				if he trembled as he turned his eyes towards his kind host, with a look that seemed
				to say, "Now, sir, I can talk to you," it was from eagerness, not weakness.</p>
			<p>Mr. Bell understood the appeal, and well inclined to answer it, said, "Having told
				you that Edward is alive and well, my dear boy, and only wants the sight that I see
				now to make him perfectly happy, I think you ought to be satisfied, and not expect
				me to tell you any more till my curiosity is gratified by hearing your own history.
				How in theworld did it happen, Michael, that when Miss Brotherton went to the Deep
				Valley Mills, on purpose to look for you, she should come back persuaded that you
				were dead, though the charming little girl she brought away with her had seen you
				there, and seemed to know you well?"</p>
			<p>Michael Armstrong told his own story more succinctly than I have been able to do it,
				and probably much better too; for he beguiled Mrs. Bell of many tears as she
				listened to him; and bare as the sad narrative was of events, her husband also hung
				upon every word of it, as if, contrary to the theory which seemed to be pretty
				generally established in his neighbourhood, he thought the feelings and the
				sufferings of a factory-child might be capable of exciting interest.</p>
			<p>When the history had reached its conclusion, and Michael had fairly brought himself
				into Mr. Bell's breakfast-parlour, he paused, and with a very eloquent look of
				entreaty said, "Now, sir, may I not listen to you?"</p>
			<p> "Yes, my dear boy," replied his new friend, in the happy tone with which a kind
				heart inspires words calculated to give pleasure. "Yes, you have much to hear, and a
				wonderful story it is, I promise you. But it shall be all true Michael, so don't
				fancy that I am telling you a fairy tale, and that Miss Brotherton is the fairy. But
				first tell me, before <pb n="324"/> I go any further, what sort of a boy was your
				brother Edward when you saw him last?" </p>
			<p>"Oh, sir! he was the dearest, kindest fellow that ever lived!" replied Michael, his
				fine eyes beaming with tenderness and well-remembered love.</p>
			<p>"But what sort of a boy was he to look at?" demanded the clergyman.</p>
			<p>Michael closed his eyes as if the better to contemplate the inward picture engraven
				on his memory.</p>
			<p>"His face was a sweet face," said he, "but his dear limbs were crippled. He was a
				slighter boy than me, and could not stand the labour of the mill; and I fear — I
				fear," he added, shuddering, "that my poor Edward must live and die a cripple."</p>
			<p>"What is your opinion about that, my dear?" said Mr. Bell, turning to his laughing
				wife.</p>
			<p>"Why, I am inclined to think that Michael will have some difficulty in identifying
				his brother when he gets to him," she replied.</p>
			<p>"Instead of being a cripple," resumed Mr. Bell, "I suspect that your brother is a
				handsomer fellow than you are, Michael. Every thing promised well for it when he
				took leave of us, and since then my wife has had letters from Miss Brotherton, which
				do not speak of any falling off in his improvement."</p>
			<p>"Nay," said the lady, "I have had more than letters to speak for it. Shall I show him
				Miss Brotherton's drawing, George?"</p>
			<p>"Most certainly, my dear; it will save me a vast deal of description, and you may
				trust to Miss Brotherton's pencil, Michael, as implicitly as to my words, for there
				never was a more faithful limner."</p>
			<p>Mrs. Bell then opened a little portfolio, secured by a key, and drew thence a drawing
				in water-colours, the composition and finish of which would have done no discredit
				to a professional artist. How the stout nerves of the young and athletic Michael
				trembled as he received it! At first his eyes seemed to fail him, the outline, the
				colouring, the whole group was indistinct. "I am a fool, sir!" he said, letting the
				hand that held it drop beside him; "I positively cannot see."</p>
			<p>"I don't much wonder at it," replied Mr. Bell; "but try again, Michael, it is worth
				looking at."</p>
			<p> And so thought Michael, as he once more placed it before him, and gazed upon it with
				an eye as eager as that of Surrey might have been, when contemplating the magic
				mirror that was to show him what he loved "in life and limb." The drawing
				represented a terrace-walk, along which ran a handsome stone balustrade partially
				covered by vine-leaves; while beneath it in the distance, stretched to a far horizon
				a glorious river, careering through a rich and varied landscape. All this was fair
				to look upon, but the boy's eyes saw it not — they were riveted upon two figures
				that occupied the foreground of the terrace. One of these was a slender girl, whose
				bright curls seemed just released from the restraint of a straw-hat which she held
				in her hand. But though the head was thus uncovered, the features were <pb n="325"/>
				not visible, for the other hand was placed upon the balustrade, over which she hung,
				as if in earnest contemplation of some object below. But the head of the other
				figure, a young man of some twenty years or so, was so turned as fully to meet the
				spectator's eye; and if the pencil that drew it flattered not, it was one of the
				handsomest that nature ever formed. The large expressive eyes, beaming with mingled
				softness and animation, were directed to some object out of the picture, but at no
				great distance; for the sweet smile that played about the mouth seemed to indicate
				that he was listening to pleasant words from some well-loved companion. The figure
				of the young man thus represented, was tall and graceful. His dress was the light
				summer garb of a southern climate — an open book was in his hand, his straw hat lay
				at his feet, beside which stood a basket of newly-gathered grapes, and a small
				Italian greyhound, its bright eye looking in the same direction as his own,
				completed the group, which spoke in every part of it a sort of graceful ease and
				enjoyment, that it was very pleasant to look upon. </p>
			<p>"Can this indeed by my Edward?" said Michael at length, after a long silent
				examination of the drawing. "How beautiful! — how noble! — how happy — how healthful
				— how intelligent he looks! <hi>Is</hi> it my own dear, pale, sickly brother? Can
				this be true?"</p>
			<p>"As true as that you stand there to look at it," replied Mr. Bell. "Is there nothing
				in the face, Michael, that recalls your brother to you?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir," he replied quickly; "the eyes and the sweet smile are so like my own
				Edward, that strange as it is to see him so healthy, tall, and graceful as he is
				represented here, and looking, too, so greatly like a gentleman, I do quite believe
				that this was never drawn for any one but him; for never, never since I saw him
				last, have I seen such eyes, or such a smile as that."</p>
			<p>"You are quite right there, Michael. The face is one not easily forgotten, and I can
				trace it here, notwithstanding all the change of age and circumstance. But who do
				you think that slender girl may be? It seems a pity not to see her face; the form,
				the pretty attitude, the bright waving locks, all plainly tell that it must be worth
				looking at. Can you guess who it is?"</p>
			<p>"I suppose it is Fanny Fletcher," replied Michael, colouring.</p>
			<p>"And there, too, you are quite right. But does it not puzzle you to think how all
				this has been brought about? How does it happen, think you, that those whom you
				remember in a state so different, should now be living as you see them here, looking
				as if their existence were made up of sunshine and sweet air?"</p>
			<p> "And now again I shall answer, as they say the fortune-tellers do," replied Michael,
				smiling, "by telling you, sir, what you have before told me. It is Miss Brotherton,
				whose name I well remember at Dowling Lodge, it is she who has done all this, and
				may God bless her for it! But yet, truly, it still seems a mystery. How did it
				happen, sir, that this rich young lady should have left her grand house, and all <pb n="326"/> her fine acquaintance here, to go into foreign countries with two poor
				factory-children?" </p>
			<p>"You may well marvel at it, Michael, for it is no common act. But will you not think
				it something stranger still, if I declare, as I can do with all truth, that you are
				yourself the primal cause of it?" said Mr. Bell. "You look incredulous, yet so it
				is. Do you remember the play, Michael?"</p>
			<p>"Sir Matthew's play?" cried Michael, burying his face in his hands. "Oh, sir! can I
				ever forget it?"</p>
			<p>"It was a vastly gay thing, too," returned Mr. Bell, smiling, "and all the performers
				were exceedingly admired; but you do not seem to remember it with any great
				pleasure?"</p>
			<p>"Pleasure, Mr. Bell?" returned Michael, with something like a groan; "I have suffered
				a good deal, considering how few years I had lived before my sufferings were over;
				but, excepting the coming home to mother's, and finding her and Teddy gone, and, as
				they told me, dead — both dead! excepting then, I never was so very, <hi>very</hi>
				wretched as while Sir Matthew was making me practise for that play!"</p>
			<p>"Do you remember the very night it was acted, when you, and he, and Dr. Crockley were
				in a room by yourselves, somewhere behind the scenes; do you remember, Michael, his
				beating and abusing you because you had cried upon the stage?"</p>
			<p>"As well as if it had happened yesterday," replied the young man. "I had to utter
				false and lying praise about him, and something I am sure there was about loving him
				as well as my dear mother. That I could not bear — and then it was that the tears
				burst out, though well I knew what I should pay for shedding them."</p>
			<p> "They were the luckiest tears that ever boy wept, so pray do not quarrel with them,"
				replied Mr. Bell. "While you were paying for them, as you call it, in the
				green-room, Miss Brotherton by accident heard and saw every thing that passed; and
				from that hour she has never forgotten you, Michael, though more than seven long
				years have passed, if I mistake not, during which you have never profited by it in
				your own person. I will not enter now into any description of what her feelings
				were. An accident prevented her seeing your mother immediately, and when she did, my
				poor boy, you were already beyond the reach of any help. But she never ceased to
				inquire, by every means in her power, whither you had been conveyed, and it was then
				she came to me, so that it is to you I owe the pleasure of knowing one of the purest
				and noblest-hearted human beings it has ever been my lot to meet with. It was in
				consequence of — not information, for I had none to give — but of a hint I gave her
				as to the nature of the place, that she set off on her exploring expedition to that
				horrid den of sin and suffering, the Deep Valley Mills, in Derbyshire. There she met
				the pretty creature whom she has since adopted. Little Fanny believed that you were
				dead, and this was the dismal news they brought to Hoxley-lane. — Your poor mother,
				Michael! But let it comfort you to know that <pb n="327"/> every want and every
				hardship were relieved from the first hour that Miss Brotherton saw her — and she
				died with the comfort of knowing that her poor Edward would never have to labour
				more. Soon after her death, Miss Brotherton took your brother to London for the
				purpose of consulting the most able surgeons about his lameness. Their science did
				not fail them; for they predicted that with proper treatment he would outgrow it —
				and so he has, completely; being at this time not only the graceful well-made
				personage you see him represented there, but healthy, active, and gifted, as I hear,
				with a most rare intelligence. For reasons which it is not very difficulty to guess,
				Miss Brotherton thought that she and her young <hi>protégées</hi> would find
				themselves better off on the continent than in Lancashire; and from the time she
				first left Milford Park to visit London, she has never returned to it. The place is
				now sold, and Miss Brotherton has no longer any possessions in this neighbourhood.
				And now my dear boy, I think I have told you all, excepting the exact spot where
				they now are; and this I cannot do, because our last letter from her informed us
				that they were just setting off upon a tour through Italy. She resided some time
				ago, for one year, at Paris, that the young people might acquire the language; but
				for the most part, Germany has been their home. It is there that your brother has
				received his education, and I think it very probable that it is there they will
				finally settle; for it is in the far-famed valley of the Rhingau that Miss
				Brotherton has purchased a spacious mansion, large enough, as she tells me, to
				accommodate half-a-dozen rich English families, with extensive and very beautiful
				grounds-around it, and all capabilities for being converted into a delicious
				residence." </p>
			<p>Here he ceased, and it was several minutes before poor Michael was capable of
				uttering a single word in return. The mention of his mother — the hint that she had
				not long survived the hearing he was dead, wrung his heart anew, with grief as fresh
				as if he had lost her yesterday; and spite of his manly stature, the tears flowed
				silently, but plenteously, down his cheeks. Yet, even when he had conquered this,
				there was something so surprising in the present situation of his brother,
				something, that notwithstanding all the fond yearnings of his own heart, seemed to
				place them so widely asunder, that the joy which Mr. Bell looked for, was less
				obvious, than an expression of almost timid embarrassment, as he said,</p>
			<p>"Alas, sir! what shall I seem like amongst them? You speak of my dear Edward's
				education in Germany — of his learning a foreign language in France — while I! — my
				best, and truly my only education has been looking at nature from the mountain's
				side as I kept sheep, and all my learning, what I have gathered from a few
				strangely-mixed volumes that I have bought or borrowed during the last four years.
				How can I present myself before them? How they can welcome me?"</p>
			<p> "Be so kind, my dear," said Mr. Bell to his wife, without immediately replying to
				Michael's question, — "be so kind, my dear, as to find Miss Brotherton's last letter
				for me. I think you took possession <pb n="328"/> of it, and I doubt not have
				preserved it among other treasures of the same kind." </p>
			<p>Mrs. Bell immediately left the room, and presently returned with the letter in her
				hand.</p>
			<p>"Take that letter, Michael," said Mr. Bell; "take it into the garden, my dear boy,
				and read it alone, and without interruption. You will find a shady seat where you
				may be very comfortable, and when you have finished the perusal come into my study,
				and tell me what you think of it."</p>
			<p>Michael's hand trembled as he took the letter, and silently obeying the instructions
				he received, he walked out to an embowered spot where he could not be seen from the
				house, and seating himself on a garden-bench perused the following letter with a
				mixture of trepidation and eagerness which may easily be imagined:</p>
			<quote><p>"Have you thought it long since last you heard from me, dear friends? I hope you
				have, for it has seemed very long to me since last I wrote to you. But what a thief
				of time is occupation! I have been so very busy in drawing plans for the repairing
				and beautifying my old castle — you would certainly call it a castle in England —
				and so constantly called upon by Edward, to give my approval to his <hi>carte du
					voyage</hi> for our Italian tour, and by Fanny, to sanction her plans for our
				future flower-garden, and by Mrs. Tremlett to settle some point of enormous
				difficulty respecting the packing up of the things to be left, and the things to be
				taken, that though day by day I have told myself, for at least a month past, that I
				was behaving most abominably in not writing, I have never before found a leisure
				hour to set about it. But if I have not written, I have drawn for you — witness the
				view from my beautiful terrace which I shall send with this letter. I wish I could
				have put my own phiz in it to show you how healthy and well I look; but
				unfortunately, you know, there is no point of sight from which an artist can catch a
				peep at himself without the aid of a looking-glass, and though I pretty nearly live
				upon my terrace, I have not yet taken either to sleeping or dressing there, so no
				mirror was at hand. But instead of myself I have given you Edward; sometimes I do
				feel a little glorious as I look at him, and remember the delicate pale face and
				feeble limbs that greeted my first sight of him in Hoxley-lane. He is now — but you
				will laugh at me if I attempt to describe him in words — the sketch I send is no bad
				likeness, and may give you a tolerably correct idea of the alteration that has taken
				place. As to my sweet Fanny, though the attempt would have been a bold one, I meant
				to have given you a likeness of her too, but her attitude was so picturesquely
				pretty as she stood, unconscious of what I was about, that I contented myself with
				the back of her curly head — you shall have her face another time.</p>
			<p> "How can I be sufficiently thankful to Providence for having redeemed my isolated
				existence from the state of uselessness in which I vegetated before I met Edward
				Armstrong and Fanny Fletcher! Not an hour now passes by me, without leaving behind
				it some trace of <pb n="329"/> my having advanced in the precious labour of making
				these two beloved beings happier. Were they merely ordinary young people, with
				average hearts and average capacities, I should still bless Heaven with a grateful
				heart, for having permitted me to be the means of changing their condition, from one
				of great suffering to a life of innocent enjoyment. But as it is, I know not how to
				be thankful enough! </p>
			<p>"It seems to me, dear friends, however much I increase my acquaintance with other
				human beings, that Edward and Fanny are the noblest creatures in the world. Is it
				that suffering, being of necessity a part of our earthly nature, we cannot arrive at
				the perfect development of all our faculties without it? Where it arrives in later
				life, perhaps, the effect, though inwardly healthful, may not show fruits so
				beautiful. There is in the minds of both of them, a brightness of intelligence, and
				a delicious calm of temper that I have never met elsewhere. It is as if a heavy
				weight that had been painfully crushing them, was suddenly removed, causing all the
				ordinary sensations of human existence to be felt as a luxury. Young as they are,
				they are full of instruction, right thinking, pure feeling, and a firmness of
				integrity which it is the best joy of my life to contemplate — and all this built on
				so firm a foundation of religious principle, that I can have no fears for its
				endurance. After this, it would be very weak and womanish folly to dwell much on
				their personal advantages, or even on the peculiar charm of their manners and
				conversation — yet they are gifts which bring a charm, to which it is difficult to
				be quite insensible.</p>
			<p>"Is it not strange, dear friends, that being such as I describe them, and having
				passed so large a portion of their lives together in the mutual contemplation of
				each other's excellence, is it not strange that they should not by this time be
				lovers, instead of friends? Yet such is not the case. That they love each other
				sincerely is most true, and I could give a thousand proofs that either would at all
				times gladly renounce amusement or pleasure of any kind, for the sake of the other;
				but they are not <hi>in love</hi> . If I did not believe it impossible, considering
				the age of the parties when they parted, I should think that Fanny's little heart
				had been buried in the grave of Michael, the poor little fellow, whose early
				sufferings under the tender patronage of Sir Matthew Dowling, first roused my sleepy
				existence into action. She cannot yet hear his name mentioned, without betraying a
				degree of emotion that it is painful to witness; and when, as sometimes happens,
				Edward is taken for her brother, it seems to delight her. 'Yes, yes, indeed he is my
				brother! I love him as such; and if you ask him, he will tell you that I am to him a
				dear and loving sister,' I have heard her say, and if Edward had been asked, I do
				believe he would have answered, and truly too, in the same strain.</p>
			<p> "Edward is now twenty-one, and my pretty Fanny nineteen; but, notwithstanding the
				variety of captivating young people with whom they are perpetually associating, I
				cannot believe that the heart of either has as yet received any tender impression —
				though in more cases than one, I have had reason to know that they have not been <pb n="330"/> looked at with indifference. Yet, sometimes I am puzzled about Edward!
				I think he is less gay and joyous than he used to be. At any time, indeed, the name
				of Michael has ever been sufficient to bring an expression of profound and hopeless
				sorrow upon his fine countenance, which it wrings my heart to see; for, alas! how
				vain must be all my affection, all sisterly love, to help him there! But,
				incontestably of late, his spirits have been less gay than formerly. This, to tell
				you the truth, is the only drawback to the happiness I enjoy. Could Fanny and Edward
				learn to forget poor Michael, I should hardly have a wish left; but I have little
				hope of this — his memory, I truly believe is too deeply engraven on their hearts,
				for any subsequent events to efface it. Sometimes, when I meditate on this
				sadly-enduring sorrow, I fancy that I should rejoice if they were both of them to
				fall in love, as a cure for it. But, alas! whenever that happens, what a breaking up
				of happiness it will be! for I can hardly hope to find a continental wife or husband
				for my adopted children, sufficiently English in habits and character, to permit my
				inviting them to make a part of my family. Yet marry abroad they must, I think, if
				they marry at all — for I will never by my own free will expose them to the
				mortification likely to ensue upon such an explanation respecting their origin, as
				must be the consequence of any matrimonial negotiation in England. On the continent,
				the ample fortunes they will possess, with their good education, and great natural
				advantages, will suffice to make them very desirable alliances to almost any one.
				But these are anxieties, which though they must come upon me sooner or later, I
				suppose, I shall endeavour to push from me, and forget as long as I can. </p>
			<p>"And now I must bid you farewell; for during the next month, or perhaps longer, our
				course will be directed by circumstances that we are not fully acquainted with as
				yet. But I will write as soon as I can tell you with certainty where your letters
				can reach us.</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Tremlett, Edward, and Fanny, send affectionate greetings to you all. And should
				it fall in your way to see, or convey a message to poor Martha Dowling, I will beg
				you to tell her that I shall ever remember her with great affection and esteem.
				Adieu!</p>
			<p>
				"Ever dear Mr. and Mrs. Bell,
			</p>
			<p>"Your grateful and affectionate, " Mary Brotherton
				."</p></quote>
			<p> Did one reading of this epistle suffice for Michael? did two? did three? It is
				difficult to say, for he remained in his shady and obscure retreat so long, that Mr.
				Bell, notwithstanding his previous determination not to disturb him, began to think
				that it was time to see whether all the good news it contained had not killed him
				with joy. And when he reached the bench, Michael still sat with the precious letter
				in his hand, and his eyes fixed upon it, so that it appeared as if he had not yet
				finished the perusal of it. Michael looked up as Mr. Bell approached him, and
				immediately rising, stepped forward to receive him. It was not, however, any wild
				excess of joy that his features expressed, <pb n="331"/> but there were traces of
				very strong emotion on his countenance, and his hand trembled as he stretched it
				forth to receive that which was kindly extended towards him. </p>
			<p>"You have remained too long alone, my dear boy, in this cold nook," said Mr. Bell,
				taking the young man's arm within his own, and leading him towards the house. "What
				makes you look so pale, Michael? You are not ill, I hope?"</p>
			<p>"No, sir, I think not," was the reply, "but I can hardly tell you how I feel. At one
				moment the idea that my dear brother still lives, and that it is possible I may
				again see him, hear him, hold him in my arms, seems to make me too happy to breathe
				— and then again, a sort of doubt and sadness takes hold upon me, and I do not feel
				as if it were possible I could ever make one in the happy party on the terrace."</p>
			<p>"And why not, Michael?" demanded Mr. Bell somewhat reproachfully; "after reading that
				letter, can you find it in your heart to doubt that the party on the terrace would
				receive you joyfully?"</p>
			<p>"Will not the happiness be too great?" cried Michael. "Oh! how can I deserve it?"</p>
			<p>"Not by doubting the goodness or the affection of those who love you," replied Mr.
				Bell. "But come, I must not preach to you now, I believe, for I suspect that you are
				not in a condition to profit by it. Come into the house, sit down, and grow
				reasonable as fast as you can, and then we will talk of the time and the mode in
				which you must set off to join your family — for your family they are, and will be,
				Michael, you may depend upon it."</p>
			<p>"Can I throw myself upon Miss Brotherton, sir, without her permission?" demanded
				Michael, while his paleness was changed for a moment into a glow of the deepest
				red.</p>
			<p>"I am afraid you have a very proud heart, Michael," said Mr. Bell, looking at him;
				"and that is not right, it is not christianlike."</p>
			<p>"Oh, Mr. Bell!" replied Michael, with strong feeling, "have I not already eaten the
				bitter bread of dependence, and can I, at my age, and with my power to labour,
				submit to it again?"</p>
			<p>"You have a notion then, young man, that benefits conferred by a Sir Matthew Dowling,
				and a Miss Brotherton, are the same thing?" said Mr. Bell.</p>
			<p>"Not so, sir," replied Michael, "I cannot doubt that she who wrote this letter, must
				be both great and good, and I well know that Sir Matthew Dowling was neither. But I
				only know Miss Brotherton as one of the fine folks visiting at his house, and I
				cannot feel that I should like to start out suddenly upon her, from the tomb, as it
				would seem, appearing to expect that she should adopt me too, as she has done my
				brother Edward."</p>
			<p> "Well, Michael, I must not blame you for this, because I believe it is very natural;
				yet, nevertheless, I feel quite sure that you will forget all such notions when you
				see Miss Brotherton," returned Mr. Bell, smiling. Michael shook his head, but he
				returned the smile, though rather languidly; and when they had reached the house,
					<pb n="332"/> and were again seated in the study, he said, "What does Miss
				Brotherton mean, sir, by calling Miss Martha Dowling 'poor Martha?' I trust that no
				misfortune has befallen her? she was very kind to me, and I shall always love her,
				although her name <hi>is</hi> Dowling." </p>
			<p>"I believe she deserves it, Michael," returned Mr. Bell, "and, by the by, you have it
				in your power to show your love, and do her a great kindness by the very simple
				process of letting her know that you are alive. Poor girl! She has suffered
				dreadfully from believing that she caused your death by the advice she gave to your
				mother about signing your indentures, and I fancy that letting her know that you did
				not perish in consequence, would be conferring a real blessing on her."</p>
			<p>"Dear, good Miss Martha!" exclaimed Michael, "how well do I remember the walk we took
				together when she went to Hoxley-lane, to give my dearest mother that advice. She
				did it for my good, and for my good it would have been, if what she advised had been
				the thing she thought it! I owe her still, notwithstanding the misery she brought me
				to, the deepest gratitude; for her kind and careful teaching during the short time I
				was in her father's house first gave me the ambition and the hope to learn, and,
				spite of my degraded condition, I have never lost sight of it — and this it is,
				which, if any thing can, may reconcile me to presenting myself as a poor
				shepherd-boy before my well-taught brother."</p>
			<p>"You are right there, Michael," replied Mr. Bell; "it is very clear to me that you
				have profited greatly by the feelings so inspired, notwithstanding the adverse
				circumstances in which you were placed during the four terrible years passed in the
				Deep Valley; and such feelings I can tell you, will make a vast difference in the
				degree of happiness you are likely to enjoy in a reunion with your brother."</p>
			<p>"And to Fanny Fletcher too!" said Michael, with the eagerness of reviving hope
				heightening his colour, and darting its brightness from his eye, — "to Fanny
				Fletcher too, I owe the suggestion of thoughts which have saved me from being too
				utterly degraded to meet her again with pleasure. It is to Martha Dowling, surely,
				that I owe all the little book learning I have been able to acquire, as well as the
				power of writing down the thoughts and meditations to which it has given rise; but
				it was Fanny who made me fell that however lowly our condition and state on earth,
				we may yet retain as good a right as any of the kings of it, to open our hearts
				before God, and ask for His Spirit to help us. How many mornings have I watched the
				sun rise, how many evenings have I seen him set in glory behind the mountain-tops,
				and thoughts as I lay amidst the heather, and worshipped his Almighty Maker, that,
				but for her, I should never have known the comfort of loving and trusting, as well
				as of adoring him. It was that dear patient little girl who taught me this, and
				perhaps I may yet live to thank her for it."</p>
			<p> "I trust you will, my dear boy," replied Mr. Bell, touched with the earnest energy
				of the boy's manner; "I trust you will, Michael: and if I mistake her not, she will
				receive such thanks as a very welcome <pb n="333"/> reward for all the pains she
				took to comfort you. Such kindness as she showed you is, indeed, — 'twice blest, It
				blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:' and I doubt not that she, as well as
				yourself, has been the better for it, from that time to this." </p>
			<p>"May I look once more at that drawing, sir?" said Michael, with some little
				embarrassment.</p>
			<p>"There it is, Michael," said the clergyman smiling, and once more laying it before
				him. "Were it not that I think you will so soon see the dear originals, and that we
				shall not, I would ask my wife to give it you."</p>
			<p>"I think I shall learn every line, and every shade of it by rote," said Michael, "if
				I do but look at it a few minutes longer. There, sir," he added, after an earnest
				gaze, and resigning it into his hands; "I feel as if it were my own now." Then,
				after one deep sigh, he seemed to rouse himself; and, as if endeavouring to shake
				off some feeling that oppressed him, he said, "But you have not told me yet, sir,
				the reason why Miss Brotherton calls my first benefactress ' <hi>poor</hi>
				Martha!'"</p>
			<p>"I am sorry to say," replied Mr. Bell, "that there are more reasons than one, for
				applying that pitying epithet to Miss Martha Dowling. In the first place, she is
				greatly out of health, poor girl; and in the next, her father's affairs are said to
				be in a very tottering condition, in consequence of his having overloaded himself
				with a greater quantity of spun cotton than he can get any sale for. He is said to
				have lent out money, too, on some speculation which has not answered: and, in short,
				that it is rather a nice question, whether he will be able to get through his
				difficulties or not. Another misfortune is, that Sir Matthew, as soon as he possibly
				could after the death of his first wife, thought proper to marry the Lady Clarissa
				Shrimpton, who, strange to say, thought proper also to marry him; and it is said
				also, that poor Miss Martha, who is the eldest of the daughters unmarried, is not
				permitted to enjoy much peace under the rule of her noble step-mother."</p>
			<p>"Lady Clarissa Shrimpton?" said Michael, with the air of one to whom some long-lost
				image is brought back — "Lady Clarissa Shrimpton? Why, surely, that was the name of
				the tall, thin woman who had to practise the laying her bony hand upon my
				unfortunate little head, when the terrible play was about?"</p>
			<p>"I dare say it was," said Mr. Bell. "But, at any rate, Lady Clarissa Shrimpton is now
				Lady Clarissa Dowling."</p>
			<p>"Poor Miss Martha! — and she is out of health too? How can I manage to pay my duty to
				her, Mr. Bell, without running the risk of being recognised by Sir Matthew, as the
				unfortunate boy who escaped from the Deep Valley? He would be able, I suppose, to
				make me serve out my time?"</p>
			<p> "I do not think he would attempt it just now, Michael?" was the consolatory reply.
				"Thank God!" continued Mr. Bell, "there has been a good deal said of late concerning
				the abominations of the <pb n="334"/> Deep Valley Factory, and I don't much think
				Sir Matthew Dowling would run the risk of having it proved that he had kidnapped a
				boy away to it, in the style he managed you. I should have no fear whatever, of your
				presenting yourself at Dowling Lodge; only I think it is ten to one her ladyship
				will not let you get a sight of Miss Martha without her being present, — unless you
				were to write a line to the young lady first, and then perhaps she might contrive
				it." </p>
			<p>Michael now rose to take his leave, offering with a fervour that was very touching,
				his earnest thanks for the generous kindness with which he had been received; but he
				resisted all the hospitable efforts made to retain him as a guest. He had need, he
				said, to be alone, that he might bring his mind to such a state as should enable him
				to sustain the wonderful change in his prospects with something like fortitude and
				rational composure. There was more real kindness, and true sympathy, in the manner
				of accepting this excuse, than the most pressing offers of hospitality could have
				shown; and Michael, after involuntarily kissing the hand stretched out to bid him
				farewell took his departure from the clergyman's house, with a heart full of
				thankfulness to God and man.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XXIX. </head>
			<p>MICHAEL CALLS HIS WISDOM TO COUNCIL, AND THE POINTS TO BE DISCUSSED PUZZLE THEM — AN
				EARLY WALK — AN OLD FRIEND WITH A CHANGED FACE.</p>
			<p>
				To describe Michael Armstrong's feeling as he took his solitary way
				along what seemed to him the most unfrequented fields he could find, would be both a
				difficult and an unnecessary task. That his heart swelled with thankfulness and joy
				cannot be doubted; yet there was a vagueness and uncertainty as to what he ought
				immediately to do, which made him anxious and sad, even in the midst of hope and
				joy. The small sum he had been able to save from his wages had been spent, or very
				nearly so, since he set out upon his eventful expedition. He had already accepted a
				loan from the friendly old coachman of Miss Brotherton, and he shrunk from the idea
				of contracting more debts, while unable to say with certainty when they should be
				paid. How then was he to reach his brother in his happy distant home? And where and
				how was he to pass the anxious interval that must of necessity intervene before he
				could even know to what point he should direct his pilgrim steps, even had he the
				means of setting forth?</p>
			<p> The path he had taken proved to be a short cut leading into the highroad from Fairly
				to Ashleigh, and on quitting the fields he found himself close to the door of a
				public-house which he was tempted to select for his shelter as long as he remained
				in the neighbourhood, both because it was lonely, and because it was humble. Having
				entered there, bespoken a bed, and made a very frugal repast, he <pb n="335"/>
				inquired the distance to Dowling Lodge, and finding it was greater than he could
				traverse on foot with any hope of returning in decent time to occupy his newly-taken
				lodging, he resolved to wait till the following morning, when, by setting off at
				daybreak, he might be able to make his visit to Martha, and perhaps report the
				result of it to Mr. Bell, before he slept. </p>
			<p>His mind had too much on which to employ itself for him to feel the afternoon a long
				one: an orchard close behind the little inn, afforded him shade and soft turf
				whereon to sit or lie, or to pace backwards and forwards, with unequal steps, as he
				meditated on the chances for and against his ever being one in the happy, thrice
				happy party described by Miss Brotherton. Nor had he wearied of these exciting, but
				most anxious thoughts, when the moon, and the stars, and the heavy dew warned him at
				length that the day was gone, and night come. And then he remembered that, in order
				to follow Mr. Bell's advice, he must prepare himself with a letter to Miss Martha,
				which it would be necessary to write before he went to bed. Fortunately his
					<hi>hotel</hi> was able to furnish the needful implements, and after a little
				reflection, he penned the following note:</p>
			<p>"A poor lad, to whom Miss Martha Dowling once showed much charitable kindness, is now
				waiting at the park-gates, to know if he may pay his duty to her. He takes the
				freedom of asking for this favour, because he has been told that she would be
				pleased to hear he was alive and well." Having directed this to Miss Martha Dowling,
				and sealed it in the best manner he could, he retired to his little bed in a state
				of mind that hovered between inexpressible felicity, and anxiety that he was hardly
				able to bear.</p>
			<p>He was afoot in time to hear the lark's first overture on the following morning: and
				his spirits, cheered by the bracing influence of the delicious hour, and by the
				sound sleep which had preceded it, enabled him to breakfast on a slice of brown
				bread, bespoken the night before, and laid ready for him, with a draught of icy-cold
				water from a neighbouring well, without any mixture of melancholy, though he thought
				the while of all the dangers and difficulties he might have to encounter ere he
				stood beside his Edward on the beautiful terrace to which his dreams had transported
				him so easily.</p>
			<p>Michael was a stout walker, and had reached the well-remembered precincts of Dowling
				Lodge soon after the earliest servants were stirring. He had made up his mind to be
				the bearer of his own letter, and accordingly, having shown the address to the woman
				at the lodge as a reason for being permitted to enter, he approached the stately
				mansion by the road which led to the offices, and intrusting his epistle to the
				first female he encountered, requested her to deliver it to Miss Martha without
				delay.</p>
			<p>"Why she bean't up yet," said the girl, looking at him, however, with the
				good-humoured smile with which light-hearted young damsels are wont to greet such
				very handsome lads as our Michael.</p>
			<p>"But perhaps you will be so good as to let her have it as soon as she is awake?" he
				replied, returning the smile.</p>
			<p> "Well, poor thing, and that may be now, most likely," returned <pb n="336"/> the
				girl, "for her cough often wakes her before this time. Will you wait for an answer?" </p>
			<p>"I won't trouble the servants by staying here," replied Michael; "but if you please
				you may tell the young lady that I will walk up and down the road till she can let
				me have it. Does Miss Martha walk out early in the mornings, as she used to do?" he
				added.</p>
			<p>"That's just what she likes best, poor thing," replied the girl. "But you needn't be
				afeard that she's gone out already; for if she had, I should have been sure to have
				seed her; for she never has the great door opened for her at this time of day, for
				fear of disturbing my lady, who always lies unaccountable late."</p>
			<p>"And does Sir Matthew rise early now?" demanded Michael with some anxiety.</p>
			<p>"He! — not he! He eats and sleeps like a pig, they say; but he is grumpier than ever
				he was, both to men and maids too, since he married the new lady. I wonder as I
				never happened to see you before, as you seem to know 'em all so well."</p>
			<p>"It is several years since I was last here," returned Michael; "but run up stairs
				with it, there's a dear girl, will you? because I want to get my answer and be
				off."</p>
			<p>"You had better stop here till I come down again," replied his good-natured
				messenger, "instead of walking up and down the road, without knowing whether there's
				an answer or no — sit down in the kitchen, and I'll be back in no time."</p>
			<p>And into the kitchen he went — the selfsame kitchen which just eight years before had
				been the scene of his painful examination by Sir Matthew Dowling's servants.' He
				remembered the room perfectly; could have pointed out the exact spot where the awful
				housekeeper sat, and the place where he had himself stood, with no better champion
				to sustain his courage than the greasy kitchen-maid, whose pitying broad face, bent
				over him, he recollected as perfectly as if it had beamed upon him but the day
				before. He was still deeply revolving these interesting reminiscences, and the
				strange contrast they offered to his present hopes, when his envoy returned — "Miss
				Martha wants to know your name, young man," she said, "but she is getting up, and
				will be walking in the park as usual, she says, presently, so it is likely enough
				that she will give you the answer herself."</p>
			<p>"Very well," replied Michael, perfectly satisfied — "good morning! — I am very much
				obliged to you."</p>
			<p>"But you haven't told me your name, and Miss Martha says that she should like to know
				it."</p>
			<p>"My name isn't one that would make any difference," he replied, "so I won't trouble
				you to go up again about that — good bye!" And without waiting for any further
				discussion, he walked off, exceedingly well pleased at having arranged the wished
				for <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> so satisfactorily. The noble dimensions of the park enabled
				Michael to select a space amply sufficient for his promenade which was neither
				within sight of the mansion nor the lodge, and ere he had made many turns upon it,
				he perceived the lady he wished to see, approaching him.</p>
			<p> He could not doubt that it was Martha, for at that hour of the <pb n="337"/> morning
				none other was at all likely to be there; but she was too much altered for him to
				recognise her in any degree. He thought she was taller than he had expected to see
				her, but at any rate she was greatly thinner, and so delicately pale, that her
				appearance was rather a contrast, than a resemblance to what he had expected to
				meet. She was already near him when he turned upon the path, and met her. He
				stopped, took off his hat, and bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p>"You are Miss Martha Dowling, ma'am?" he said interrogatively.</p>
			<p>"Yes," replied Martha, "that is my name, but when did I see you before, young man? I
				do not know you."</p>
			<p>"It is a great many years, Miss Martha — but I can never forget your kindness."</p>
			<p>The pale cheek of Martha was tinted with a vivid blush, as she exclaimed, "If it were
				possible — if I did not know that he was dead — But this is nonsense," she added,
				recovering her composure. "I quite forget your person, young man," she continued,
				after a pause: "But if I have ever done you any service, I am glad of it. Perhaps if
				you tell me your name I may remember the circumstances to which you allude."</p>
			<p>"Oh! Miss Martha!" replied Michael, "I am afraid my name will startle you, and
				therefore I do not like to speak it. But I think it came into your head just now,
				only you stopped short, and said it was impossible."</p>
			<p>"Can it be Michael Armstrong that I see?" demanded Martha, in an agitated voice.</p>
			<p>"It is indeed, Miss Martha!" he replied. "It is Michael Armstrong, come back to thank
				you for all your great kindness to him."</p>
			<p>"My kindness to Michael Armstrong?" she exclaimed. — "Alas! it was I who occasioned
				all his sufferings, and, as I have thought for many years, his death. How is it you
				have been saved, Michael? How is it you have escaped from the horrid place to which
				I was the cause of your being sent?"</p>
			<p>"My dear Miss Martha!" returned Michael, greatly affected by her look of ill-health,
				and by the agitation she displayed — for tears were trickling fast down her pale
				cheeks. "My dear Miss Martha," he said, " <hi>I</hi> know, if nobody else does, the
				kind motive that you had for every word you spoke — and was it not I myself that
				said I wanted to go, Miss Martha, when we walked together from here, down to poor
				mother's house? Never, never can I thank you enough for all your goodness then, as
				well as at all other times, from the very first moment that ever I saw you?"</p>
			<p>"Thank God!" cried poor Martha, fervently clasping her hands, and raising her eyes to
				heaven, "you know not, Michael, what a load you have taken from my heart! I have for
				years lived under the dreadful weight of believing myself to be your murderer. The
				thought has haunted me by night, and rarely quitted me by day. And my poor father
				too! This crime at least he has not to answer for!"</p>
			<p> Michael could not help thinking — though for worlds he would not have lessened her
				pious satisfaction by uttering the thought — that <pb n="338"/> though he had
				escaped with life from the terrible sufferings to which he had been exposed, he owed
				Sir Matthew but little gratitude for it. Fortunately, however, for his veracity, he
				was not called upon to answer this observation, for Martha immediately added. </p>
			<p>"Does Miss Brotherton know that you are alive, Michael?"</p>
			<p>"No, Miss Martha, she does not," he replied; "my brother Edward is living with her in
				some place abroad, and till yesterday I have existed in the dismal belief that
					<hi>he</hi> was dead, and that I had not a single relation in the whole
				world."</p>
			<p>"And where are you living, Michael? What is your home now? And how did you escape
				from the dismal place to which you were sent as an apprentice?"</p>
			<p>In answer to this, Michael related, as briefly as he could contrive to do it, all
				that had happened to him, confessing freely that he had run away, and that he
				supposed he was liable to be sent back again to work out his time, if Sir Matthew
				discovered that he was alive, and if it were his pleasure to do it.</p>
			<p>"We will not talk of any thing of that kind, Michael," said Martha, a bright blush
				again visiting her cheek. "It would not be prudent, certainly, for you to make
				yourself known here — and I particularly desire that you will not do it. I am
				grateful, oh! most grateful, for your coming to tell me that the dismal news of your
				death was not true, but now that you have set my heart at rest on that score, do not
				come here again, Michael — Lady Clarissa is very particular about every body that
				comes to the house — and — in short — though I shall always have the greatest regard
				for you, Michael — I would a great deal rather that you did not come to Dowling
				Lodge again."</p>
			<p> Michael perfectly understood, though it was evident she would not avow it, that poor
				Martha had fears for his safety, should Sir Matthew discover him; and without giving
				her the slightest reason to suppose that he saw this, he assured her that he was
				going immediately from Ashleigh without any intention of returning to it. Martha
				then looked at her watch, and seeing that there was still above an hour to spare
				before the usual time at which the family came down stairs, ventured to seat herself
				on the trunk of a newly-felled tree, while she questioned the youth, for whom she
				still felt the strongest interest, as to what his projects were, and when, and how
				he thought of leaving England to join his brother. With frank and touching
				simplicity, Michael entered freely into all his harassing doubts and difficulties —
				confessed that he had not a shilling in the world that he could call his own, and,
				worse still, that he could not help feeling a strong repugnance to throwing himself
				wholly on the charity of Miss Brotherton, for no other reason in the world than
				because she had nobly provided for his brother. "To know that Edward is alive, and
				not endeavour to see him is impossible," he continued. "But I would fain earn money
				enough, if it were possible, to enable me to get to him without being chargeable to
				her, and once within reach of him — once near enough to his dwelling-place to know
				that we need never be many days asunder, I should not fear but that I might earn my
				living, without being indebted to charity <pb n="339"/> for it. I was always
				stronger than Edward, you know, Miss Martha, and there is no reason because he lives
				an idle life, dear fellow, that I should do so too." </p>
			<p>"Michael!" she replied, her whole countenance lighted up with the most animated
				expression of pleasure, "my dear Michael Armstrong! your coming here is certainly
				the greatest blessing that Heaven could have sent me. I cannot tell you, and you can
				never know, all I have suffered from believing you were dead, and from
					<hi>knowing</hi> that I had been the cause of great and terrible suffering to
				you. And that, too, wholly owing to the trust which you, and your poor mother
				reposed in me! May you never, my dear boy, know what it is to have a conscience
				burdened as mine has been. Be very sure that it is worse than any thing you could
				have suffered at the Deep Valley, Michael! When you see Mary Brotherton, tell her
				that I owned this to you — and perhaps she may think, at last, that she judged me
				rather more harshly than I deserved."</p>
			<p>"If she judged you harshly at all, she was very wrong," replied Michael, warmly.
				"People should know, before they judge. Nobody who really knew you, <hi>could</hi>
				judge you harshly."</p>
			<p>"I had rather that kind sentence came from your lips, Michael, than from those of any
				other human being. If <hi>you</hi> can say it, and mean it too, as I am sure you do,
				who is there living that can have a right to say the contrary? Yet this is not my
				only pleasure — I happen to have the power — and I bless my poor father for it — of
				making some little atonement for the years of suffering that I so unwittingly caused
				you. From the day we were each of us fifteen, we have received an allowance of sixty
				pounds a year for dress, and though I really never wanted one-half so much as my
				sisters, my father, who has ever been a kind father to me, has always insisted upon
				my having the same, and at the marriage of my two elder sisters, he gave me a
				hundred pounds each time, that I might be smart. But I have no taste for finery,
				Michael, it always made me melancholy; so I am very rich — I really do not know how
				rich, for I have always kept on laying the bank-notes that I did not want in a
				drawer, and I have never counted them. Think if it will not be a pleasure for me now
				to open that drawer, and give you all that is in it? Oh! with what different
				feelings shall I go to bed to-night from any I have felt for years past! I am sure
				there must be enough to take you to Italy, or wherever else Miss Brotherton may be
				gone, and to set you up in some little business into the bargain. Wait here only ten
				minutes, my dear Michael, and I will return with my treasure — a real treasure now,
				and for the first time that I ever thought it so!"</p>
			<p>Martha had risen from her seat as she spoke, and literally before Michael could
				recover from his atonishment sufficiently to answer her, she was already at some
				distance from him. He had by no means settled to his satisfaction the question of
				whether he ought, or ought not, to strip the generous Martha of her little hoard
				when she again appeared. But she looked hurried and out of breath.</p>
			<p> "Make haste, Michael, dear Michael!" she said, with much agitation. <pb n="340"/>
				"For pity's sake let me not be again plunged in all the misery of self-reproach from
				which I have so recently escaped. Take this parcel, Michael! Nay, never stay to
				count them! My father has left his room — may have inquired for me — and even now be
				following me. Bless you, Michael! Bless you! Go, go, for goodness sake, and leave
				the country as quickly as possible." </p>
			<p>With these words she turned from him, and with a step too rapid for her state of
				health, and plainly showing her extreme anxiety, she hastily retreated towards the
				house.</p>
			<p>Though after hearing Mr. Bell's decided opinion that no further danger was to be
				feared from Sir Matthew Dowling, Michael would himself have felt not the least
				desire to run away from him, yet it was impossible not to perceive that Martha was
				of a different mind, and that for some reason or other she was exceedingly anxious
				that he should not remain near Dowling Lodge, or, in other words, within her
				father's reach. Whether she were right, or wrong, in fancying that it was necessary
				for his safety that he should keep out of the way, he felt that it would be cruel to
				oppose her; and with the unexamined roll of bank-notes thrust into his coat-pocket,
				he gave but one farewell look at the retreating drapery of poor Martha, and then
				with rapid strides, and thoughts so full of the scene which had just passed, that he
				followed the right path rather mechanically than from judgment, he set off upon his
				return to the humble lodging he had secured for the night.</p>
		</div><div type="chapter">
			<head> CHAPTER XXX. </head>
			<p>MICHAEL GROWS RICH, AND TAKES A VERY DELIGHTFUL WALK BACK TO WESTMORLAND — HIS
				PREPARATIONS FOR A LONGER JOURNEY ARE SUDDENLY STOPPED — HE MAKES A PAINFUL VISIT,
				BUT MEETS MANY OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</p>
			<p>
				The morning's walk had been a long one, even for Michael Armstrong,
				and right glad was he to find himself again in the neatly-sanded kitchen of his
				little inn, with a loaf and cheese before him, of sufficient dimensions to resist
				any attacks he could make upon them. A moderate proportion of beer, in addition to
				the solid meal these afforded, refreshed him so effectually that he determined to
				take his leave of Mr. Bell that night, preparatory to setting off on his return to
				Westmorland on the following morning, in order to bid farewell to his good old
				master there. On the subject of Martha's bank-notes he meant to be entirely guided
				by the advice of the clergyman, being equally fearful of offending, or rather of
				paining their generous owner by refusing to accept them, or of depriving her of what
				might be hereafter useful by agreeing to do so.</p>
			<pb n="341"/>
			<p>"I have seen Miss Martha, sir!" were his first words on entering Mr. Bell's parlour,
				and both look and accent showed that the interview had been an interesting one.
				"But, alas! she is greatly altered," he added, restraining with difficulty the tears
				that rose to his eyes. "I fear she is very ill; — but she was glad — oh! so glad to
				see me, sir! She has been fretting, poor dear young lady, under the false notion
				that she had been to blame about me; but, thank Heaven! think she knows better now,
				and perhaps when her mind is at ease again she may recover health. I can't bear to
				think how pale and thin she is grown, and all about me, to whom she was the best and
				kindest friend that ever poor boy had. And see, sir, what she has done now!"
				continued Michael, drawing forth the roll of notes from his pocket. "Here is a large
				sum of money, I believe. She did not rightly know how much it was herself, she told
				me, because she had kept on putting by what she did not want, and had never counted
				how much it came to — and I'm sure I have not counted it either; but whether it is
				little or much, I don't feel quite certain whether I ought to take it."</p>
			<p>Mr. Bell smiled at the unusual manner in which the rich-looking, but
				carelessly-packed roll of paper had passed from one hand to the other. Before he
				examined the contents he questioned Michael as to all that the generous-hearted girl
				had said to him, on bestowing it, and the young man's faithful answers soon
				convinced him that there would be little kindness to the self-reproaching Martha in
				refusing a donation which she evidently considered as an atonement, and which would,
				he doubted not, by its application to Michael's necessities, do more towards healing
				her wounded mind than any other thing whatever.</p>
			<p>"You must not refuse the gift, Michael," said Mr. Bell, after hearing his narrative
				to the end. "I do not wonder, little as she has been to blame in the matter, at her
				having suffered greatly for all that she innocently made you suffer; nor am I at all
				surprised, since it was in her power to do so, that she should wish to make you this
				atonement. It comes at a lucky moment, my dear boy, for not only will it enable you
				to present yourself before Miss Brotherton, without throwing yourself, as you said
				yesterday, upon her charity, but I suspect it may go far in assisting your hopes of
				entering into some business, which may enable you to support yourself."</p>
			<p>Mr. Bell then opened the bundle of notes, and found that they amounted to rather more
				than five hundred pounds; a sum which, to Michael, appeared so enormous that he
				uttered something like a remonstrance against the opinion which advised his
				appropriating the whole.</p>
			<p>"Did you not tell me, sir," he said, "that Sir Matthew Dowling's affairs were not
				considered to be in so flourishing a state as they had been? And may not this money
				be wanted by Miss Martha in case he should really become involved in
				difficulties?"</p>
			<p> "I think there is no danger of her wanting it, Michael," returned Mr. Bell. "Let
				what will happen, I have no doubt that Sir Matthew <pb n="342"/> will be able to
				secure sufficient from the relics of his enormous wealth to maintain his family in
				easy circumstances. A sum like this, my dear boy, is but a drop in such an ocean." </p>
			<p>Michael resisted no longer, and this point being settled, his plan of operations was
				soon arranged. In deference to Martha's fears for his safety, he decided not to
				visit his good friend Richard Smithson, at Milford, Mr. Bell undertaking to settle
				the matter of the loan, and moreover to convey to the kind-hearted man the
				assurances of Michael's well-doing, of his gratitude, and hearty good wishes. The
				letter from the travellers, which was to settle the happy Michael's road, would
				probably arrive within a week or two, and Mr. Bell recommended that, having paid his
				farewell visit to Westmorland he should return to Fairly, and there equip himself in
				such a manner as would be suitable for presenting himself before Miss Brotherton.
				Mr. Bell agreed to take the custody of his treasure, till his return, and with his
				bundle again on his shoulder, and five pounds in his pocket, Michael set off to walk
				over the fells and moors he had to traverse, with a lightness of spirit that seemed
				to strew the deserts with flowers, and made every blast that blew upon him as soft
				and sweet as the gales of Araby. It was not the least, perhaps, of his pleasures, as
				he strode sturdily along, to compare his present walk with that which had conducted
				him from the Deep Valley to Ashleigh, four years before.</p>
			<p>The suffering, the terror, and the final agony of that expedition could not come over
				his mind, however, without throwing a shade over his gladness; but it chastened
				without obscuring the bright combination of objects that glowed in the prospect
				before him; and, altogether, it would be difficult to find any walk on record more
				replete with enjoyment than this of Michael to the humble mountain-home that had so
				kindly sheltered him.</p>
			<p>It was with a very flattering mixture of joy and sorrow that the good statesman and
				his family accepted Michael's farewell, and listened to his happy hopes; and it was
				amidst blessings and hearty good wishes that once again he sallied forth to wend his
				way for the last time over the mountains, and bid a fond and lingering adieu to his
				beloved lakes and tarns. He felt that those had been to him as teachers and
				preachers, elevating his heart and imagination, and preparing him, more effectually
				perhaps than any other school could have done, for the different sphere of life in
				which he now hoped to move.</p>
			<p> On reaching Fairly, he found that a letter had arrived from Miss Brotherton,
				enclosing one to Martha Dowling, which had been forwarded immediately; and which, by
				what the kind-hearted heiress said to her Fairly friends, seemed to have been
				written in consequence of the reports which had reached her respecting the failing
				fortunes of Sir Matthew. Miss Brotherton was at Nice, where it was her purpose to
				remain for some months. To Nice, then, the thrice happy Michael prepared to go; a
				respectable wardrobe, and all other necessary equipments were easily procured in the
				neighbourhood, his place to <pb n="343"/> London taken, and all things ready for his
				setting off, save that he still expected an answer to a very cautiously-worded
				epistle which he had ventured to address to Martha, informing her that he was
				setting off for Nice, and that any letter or message she might wish to convey to
				Miss Brotherton, should be carefully delivered by her faithful humble servant, M. A. </p>
			<p>Michael was at breakfast with his kind and hospitable friends, when a lad, bearing
				great marks of hasty travelling in his appearance, made his way into the room, and
				with a look that seemed to prophesy eventful tidings, if he were but asked for them,
				delivered a letter to Mr. Bell. This proved, however, to be only a blank cover,
				enclosing one to Michael, which was handed to him, while the eyes of his host and
				hostess fixed themselves with some anxiety on his face. Michael tore open the
				despatch, and changed colour as he read it. Then, giving an intelligible glance at
				the messenger who ceased not to wipe his forehead with one arm, while he held his
				hat squeezed to his side with the other, he said, "I should like to speak to you
				about this, Mr. Bell."</p>
			<p>"Go into the kitchen, my lad," said the clergyman, "and get some breakfast. You shall
				know when the answer is ready."</p>
			<p>Though evidently disappointed at being thus dismissed unquestioned, the boy consoled
				himself with the hope of a kitchen audience, and making his reverence, retired.</p>
			<p>"What in the world have you got there, Michael?" demanded Mr. Bell. "Not good news, I
				am afraid?"</p>
			<p>"No, indeed, sir," replied Michael, "very far from it. It is from Miss Martha
				Dowling, who seems to be in great distress."</p>
			<p>"Read it to us, my good fellow, will you? If there is no reason to the contrary."</p>
			<p>"What is written here, sir, cannot long be a secret from any body. This is what she
				says:</p>
		<quote>	<p>"'Dear Michael!</p>
			<p>"'Pray come to me at Dowling Lodge directly. There is no longer any danger to be
				feared from my poor dear father, for he is very, very ill — and I think you can be
				useful to me, which I am sure you will be if you can. Alas! Michael, you will
				witness a dreadful scene! My poor father has kept every thing secret to the very
				last; meaning, I am sure, to prepare his family for it as well as he could. I could
				not think what it was made him send all my sisters away to Arabella and Harriet. The
				two little ones, indeed, as well as the three youngest boys, are all at school, so
				that I am the only child he has left with him, my elder brothers being all away in
				their different professions. I tell you all this now, Michael, because I shall, I
				suppose, have no time to say any thing but on necessary business when you come here.
				Do not delay, I am sure you can be useful to me.</p>
			<p>
				"'In great sorrow, your friend,
			</p>
			<p>"' Martha Dowling .'"</p></quote>
			<pb n="344"/>
			<p>"Poor girl! This is sad indeed!" cried Mr. Bell. "I imagine, though she does not
				explain herself, that her father's affairs are fallen into confusion. Yet I cannot
				guess what you can do for her. However, you must go immediately of course; and you
				had better hire a chaise that no time may be lost. And I would advise you, Michael,
				to take with you the pocket-book which Mrs. Bell packed up for you so carefully last
				night. I fear that it is but too likely your prediction will be fulfilled already,
				and that the poor young lady may be glad to have some of her notes returned."</p>
			<p>"Thank God! that I was not gone," replied Michael, fervently. "It will be the
				greatest pleasure of my life, if I can be useful to her!"</p>
			<p>Little time was lost in setting off; and certainly much before his arrival had been
				hoped for by Martha, Michael, who left his postchaise at a public-house near the
				lodge, was walking towards the mansion by the same path in which he had so lately
				parted from her. On entering the kitchen, the scene which met his eyes, explained at
				the very first glance the nature of the business carrying on upon the premises. A
				number of men were standing about, some few occupied in sticking slips of paper
				inscribed "Lot No. — ," upon a variety of articles which appeared to have been
				collected there for the purpose. Others, with black canvass aprons and paper caps,
				were coming and going with no very apparent purpose; while another set, with cold
				meat and beer-flagons before them, sat round a small table in a corner, discoursing
				upon themes which appeared to occasion them much merriment.</p>
			<p>But among all these, there was not one that looked like a servant of the house; and
				taking advantage of the confusion which seemed to license the freedom, he walked on
				without speaking to any of them, and determined to trust to his memory for finding
				the small morning-parlour which used to contain all poor Martha's little literary
				personalties, and in which all his reading and writing lessons had been
				received.</p>
			<p>Neither his recollection nor his conjeture deceived him; he found the apartment he
				sought, and on opening the door, discovered Martha sitting there. But she was not,
				as he had hoped to find her, alone. On a sofa placed opposite the windows sat a
				figure, bolt upright in the middle of it, with a sofa-table before her entirely
				covered with trinkets, delicate Sèvre china, miniature bronzes, and other valuable
				nick-nacks. A quantity of cotton-wool lay on the sofa beside her, and her long lean
				fingers were actively employed in selecting the most precious articles, enveloping
				them in the wool, and then cramming them into a large basket that stood before her,
				— sometimes selecting one, either smaller or more precious than the rest, and
				thrusting it into her pocket or up her sleeve. A large Indian screen was spread
				before the door, which induced Michael, on hearing a voice that certainly was not
				that of his friend Martha, to remain unseen long enough to decide whether his
				entrance would be likely to occasion her any embarrassment.</p>
			<pb n="345"/>
			<p>"I tell you, Martha, that you talk like a fool, and that is what you always were, and
				always will be!" said the upright lady, in a shrill voice, but in a tone that she
				was endeavouring to reduce to a whisper. "What right can any one of these horrid
				dirty fellows have with what is mine, i should like to know? I am not going to be
				made bankrupt, or sent to jail, or have my property seized, because your abominable,
				wicked, low-born, brutal, treacherous, false father, has been found out, and is
				going to be treated as he deserves. As for you, and all the rest of your family,
				there is nothing to be said or done, I suppose, but to submit, and just do what you
				can to get your bread. With such blood as you have got in your veins, there will be
				no great harm done if you were all to go out as housemaids and footmen. The thing
				happens among low people continually, if the father gets into distress; but I should
				like to know who ever heard of a woman of quality, the daughter of an earl, being
				treated in the same sort of unceremonious way?"</p>
			<p>"But indeed, Lady Clarissa, it will be a great deal worse for my father, if it is
				found out that his wife has been endeavouring to secrete property," said Martha.</p>
			<p>"His wife, indeed! A pretty sort of husband he has made me, hasn't he? Having my
				noble arms painted on his paltry carriages, and engraven on his plate, not a single
				ounce of which had been twenty years in his possession; and then, vulgar wretch!
				insisting upon seeing my housekeeper's account, for fear I should save any thing out
				of the money he allowed me! Pitiful, cheating, brutal, manufacturing savage! But
				thank Heaven! my slavery is at an end! — To-morrow will see me many a good mile on
				my way to Scotland! The monsters say I may take my clothes and my money — and my
				clothes and my money I will take, I promise you, Miss Martha; so I would really
				advise you to go and collect your own things, and see them put together decently.
				You may be able to sell some of them perhaps, which might be very useful, and that
				would be spending your time much more profitably, and decently too, than sitting
				there lecturing me upon what I may, and what I may not take. I shall take every
				thing that belongs to me, and there's an end of that; and I wish to my heart you
				would just go away and leave me in peace."</p>
			<p>"Did I not know, Lady Clarissa, that my father would suffer for it," said Martha
				rising, "I would not have troubled you with my remonstrances; but I am certain that
				you are now occupied in abstracting things that of right belong to my poor father's
				creditors, and if it is discovered, it may be the means of their refusing his
				certificate, and he may be thrown into a jail for life."</p>
			<p>"And where could he be better, Miss Martha? I am sure I don't know. My belief is that
				he is mad, or going to be mad, and I don't see but a jail is as comfortable as a
				mad-house, and as it must be a great deal cheaper, it will suit his circumstances a
				great deal better. I wish you would go, child, and see if there is such a thing in
				the house as a basin of soup for my luncheon. I may ring and ring, but there is not
				a creature that will answer the bell now."</p>
			<pb n="346"/>
			<p>Martha made no reply, but she rose from her chair, and Michael stepped back into the
				passage, that she might not meet him within hearing of her selfish step-mother.</p>
			<p>"You are come, then!" exclaimed the poor girl, on catching sight of him. "This is
				very kind of you, Michael! If you will walk this way with me — there is nobody in
				the great drawing-room now — I will explain my reasons for sending for you."</p>
			<p>Michael followed her to the well-remembered drawing-room, which had so often
				witnessed the display of Sir Matthew's munificent charity, by showing him off to all
				the neighbourhood. The recollection was very hateful to him, yet the right-hearted
				lad felt a pang as he accompanied his benefactress into this greatly-altered scene
				of former splendour. The whole house was under preparation for a sale by auction,
				and nothing could exceed the speaking state of gilded desolation which this fine
				room exhibited.</p>
			<p>Never mind the confusion, Michael! Just step over these curtains — we can sit down,
				up in that corner of the room — take care of the mirrors, my dear boy! Surely they
				have thrown these costly things about more heedlessly than was necessary!" said poor
				Martha, as she led the way rather over, then through the scattered mass of splendid
				furniture with which the room was strewed.</p>
			<p>"It is strange, Michael," she resumed, as soon as they had seated themselves in a
				clear space of six feet wide, where two chairs were standing near one of the
				windows, — "it is strange, most strange, that you should be the only person that I
				could think of to assist my poor father in his misery! You who have suffered so
				severely from — from his displeasure. But I found out, Michael, that you had a kind,
				good heart, when you used to talk to me of your mother and poor Teddy. It was that
				which made me take notice of you then, and it is that which makes me ask for your
				assistance now."</p>
			<p>"And happy and thankful shall I be if I can do you any good, Miss Martha!" replied
				Michael, eagerly. "I have brought back the notes, all but about twelve pounds, that
				has been laid out for me. It is a very large sum, Miss Martha, and I trust it will
				be useful to you."</p>
			<p> "I do not want it, my dear boy!" replied Martha, smiling through her tears, "but I
				am glad to find that I was not mistaken in you. No, Michael! let me still, under all
				circumstances, have the unspeakable comfort of believing that I have been able to
				make you some little atonement for all you have gone through from my ill-judged and
				ignorant advice. You would make no difficulty about keeping what has been
				accumulated out of my hatred of silks and satins, Michael, if you could guess the
				extraordinary good it has done me to know that you are alive and well, and less
				destitute than you would have been, had you never seen me. I thought I was dying,
				Michael, before your little note reached me; but now, strange to say, spite of all
				the calamities which have fallen upon my family since, I feel as if I might still
				live long enough to be useful to my poor father. Alas! Michael, his condition is
				very dreadful! For some months past, I have perceived a great alteration in him. His
				memory ha <pb n="347"/> failed him, and at times his temper has been so variable
				that I have seen him violently angry, and very intemperate in his language, one
				minute, and enduring the insolence of Lady Clarissa, with the meekness of a child,
				the next. And now — In short, Michael, I greatly fear that his reason is shaken by
				the misfortunes that have fallen upon him. He has kept all his commercial disasters
				so completely to himself, that not even his most confidential agents were at all
				aware of their extent; and I therefore hope that if I can contrive to remove him
				from this melancholy scene, his mind will be relieved by felling that the worst is
				over, and that I may have the exceeding happiness of seeing him restored to reason
				and to health." </p>
			<p>"And in what way then can I be useful to you, my dear Miss Martha? I dare not combat
				your will, but it seems to me that if his creditors are stripping his house in this
				way, such a sum as you have put into my hands might be very useful to him," said
				Michael.</p>
			<p> "And so it would, certainly, my good friend, if he had not provided for the
				exigences of this terrible moment, by having a large sum of ready money in the
				house, a fact which he has confided to me only," replied Martha. "His marriage with
				Lady Clarissa," she continued, "has been a greater misfortune to him, Michael, than
				any losses in his business could possibly be. She has led him a most wretched life —
				constantly keeping his high spirit in subjection by threatening to bring her brother
				upon him, if he treated her with any want of respect, and my poor father's reverence
				for rank and title is such, that he has submitted to her in every thing. But during
				the terrible fortnight that has passed since the disclosure of his ruin, her conduct
				has been perfectly frightful — and I feel quite certain that when she has taken
				herself off to Scotland, which she intends to do to-morrow, my father will feel so
				greatly relieved, that the very best effects upon his mind may be hoped for from it.
				What I want you to do for me, Michael, is this: You must procure a postchaise to be
				at the Lodge-gates to-night at twelve. The men who are left in charge of the house,
				get both tired and tipsy before that hour, and will be in bed and asleep; and then I
				think I shall be able to get my poor father away from all the irritating objects
				which surround him here. He has been very ill with violent spasms, and confined to
				his bed for a day or two, which one of the maids tells me is the reason why he has
				not been more strictly watched. They think he is too ill to get away. But he is
				greatly better to-day, and though I have persuaded him to remain in bed, I think he
				has quite lost the complaint, and will be able to get off if you will do what I
				desire of you. I know not another being that I could trust. My poor father has spent
				a great deal of money, and been very liberal to many, but I do not know one whom I
				do not suspect would be more ready to betray, than to help him, if they saw him
				endeavouring to get away. His physician, Dr. Crockley, a man on whom he has heaped
				innumerable favours, is, I strongly suspect, acting as a spy upon him; and it is
				because I expect his daily visit presently, that I will not let my father get up.
				Therefore you see, Michael, there are some difficulties to be encountered. <pb n="348"/> Do you think you could manage to get a chaise to the gates without its
				being known that it was for him?" </p>
			<p>"I am quite sure of it," replied Michael; "for to save time I came hither in a chaise
				myself, which is now waiting at the public-house to take me back to Fairly. I have
				only to go and tell the boy that I shall not be able to return before night, in
				order to have him ready to start at any hour you please."</p>
			<p>"To Fairly?" said Martha, musingly. "But it is no matter — he may sleep at the inn
				there as well as at any other, and the next morning we must make our way to the
				nearest port where there is a chance of our finding a steam-boat going to France. It
				will not do at present for my father to remain in the country. When he has got his
				certificate, he will be safe; but I greatly fear some difficulty about it."</p>
			<p>While Martha was thus explaining her hopes and fears, the sound of carriage-wheels
				was heard slowly approaching by the road which led to the chief entrance, and which
				passed at no great distance from the window at which they were sitting.</p>
			<p>"Here comes Dr. Crockley!" she exclaimed; "I am very glad his visit will be over so
				early. This will give me time for preparation."</p>
			<p>But she was mistaken; the equipage she heard a approaching was not the recently
				set-up cab of Dr. Crockley, but the donkey-chair of the ever active Mrs. Gabberly.
				Nothing could be much farther from poor Martha's inclination than encountering the
				prying old woman at this moment; but having hastily told Michael to appear as if he
				were employed in taking a catalogue of the furniture, for which purpose, paper,
				pens, and ink lay conveniently ready on one of the marbleslabs, she hurried out into
				the hall for the purpose of meeting the physician, and attending him as usual to her
				father — so that the avoiding Mrs. Gabberly was impossible.</p>
			<p>"Oh, my poor dear Martha! that's you, is it? Well now! you was just the person I
				wanted to see. But I do wonder you did not get off with your father, poor man! when
				he made his escape, this morning," said the unchanged little lady.</p>
			<p>"I know not what you mean, Mrs. Gabberly," replied Martha gravely. "My poor father
				has been extremely ill, and is at this moment confined to his bed." The old lady
				gave a wink with one of her little cunning black eyes, and nodding her head very
				expressively, replied, "Old birds are not caught with chaff, my dear."</p>
			<p>"What is it that you mean, Mrs. Gabberly — that you do not believe me?" said Martha,
				indignantly.</p>
			<p>"You are very foolish to bawl out in that manner, my dear, with that young fellow
				that's cataloguing in there, close within hearing. Mind, it is your fault and not
				mine, if he suspects any thing from your violence."</p>
			<p> "You are taking an account of all the looking-glasses, are you not?" said Martha,
				approaching the drawing-room door and addressing Michael. "You may come into Sir
				Matthew's room now, if you please. He was asleep when I sent you away just now."
				Then, turning to Mrs. Gabberly, she added — "Perhaps you would be so <pb n="349"/>
				good as to see my poor father, Mrs. Gabberly? I would not wish you to stay long with
				him, for he is very feverish; but I dare say he would take it very kindly if you
				will just come in to inquire for him." </p>
			<p>Looking a good deal surprised, but accepting the invitation with great alacrity, Mrs.
				Gabberly began to mount the stairs; exceedingly well pleased to have an opportunity
				of procuring so excellent a ticket of admission to every house in the neighbourhood,
				as this ocular demonstration of the actual condition of the fallen knight would
				furnish. Michael, in compliance with the order he had received, followed after; and
				in a few minutes, found himself once more in the presence of the man under whose
				tyranny he had suffered so terribly. But a harder heart than Michael's might have
				been softened into forgiveness and forgetfulness of all former injuries, by the
				miserable aspect of the wretched man who lay stretched upon the splendid bed that he
				could no longer call his own. His steadfast-minded and affectionate daughter — the
				only earthly good that avenging Heaven had left him — entered first, intending to
				announce the visit of Mrs. Gabberly; but Sir Matthew started up in bed, and before
				she could speak, cried out, "Do not let that devil Crockley come to me, Martha! I
				will not see him, I tell you. I have got no pain now; and if I had, don't I know he
				would rather give me poison than physic? He is going to lose his annuity, you
				know."</p>
			<p>"It is Mrs. Gabberly, dear papa, just come to ask you how you are," said Martha,
				leading the old lady to the bedside. "She will not stay, because you are not well
				enough to talk; but you will be glad to see her, will you not?"</p>
			<p>"Glad?" said the miserable man, knitting his brows, and throwing upon her a look of
				deep aversion. "Don't I know her? Is she not the town-crier of all the country
				round? Have I not paid her for it a hundred times? And do you think I don't know
				what she is come for now? Somebody else will pay her now, for bringing them word how
				the poor bankrupt Dowling looks."</p>
			<p>"Well now, that <hi>is</hi> terrible, to be sure!" exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly. "He is
				quite shook in his mind. Do you think he would be outrageous if I was to feel his
				pulse, my dear? I should like to prescribe for him — I should indeed. Poor dear man!
				His talking about paying me <hi>is</hi> comical to be sure. Let me feel your pulse,
				Sir Matthew, shall I?"</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew looked so very much as if he would have liked to take her up in his
				enormous hand and throw her to the further end of the room, that Martha thought it
				prudent to prevent her nearer approach.</p>
			<p>"You have now <hi>seen</hi> my father, Mrs. Gabberly," she said with emphasis, "and
				that, I think, is all that can be necessary for your satisfaction."</p>
			<p> "Oh! certainly — it is very satisfactory," she replied, but without appearing to
				have the slightest intention of leaving the room; for, in truth, it was at that
				moment the place where, beyond all others, she best liked to be. The downfal of Sir
				Matthew Dowling was the <pb n="350"/> subject that employed every tongue, and nobody
				could be so welcome to every drawing-room, and every dining-room too, throughout the
				neighbourhood, as one who could testify to having seen him, listened to him, and
				ascertained how he seemed to bear it. It was impossible that any person could have
				been better qualified for the service than Mrs. Gabberly. Willingly would the still
				brisk little lady have crept under the toilet-table, or the bed itself, rather than
				have lost so glorious an opportunity; and instead of attending to Martha's repeated
				assurance that she "had better go now," she began opening sundry physic-vials that
				stood on a table at the bottom of the bed, smelling some, tasting others, and
				pronouncing judgment upon all. </p>
			<p>"It is quite a mystery to me, my dear, what Dr. Crockley can be thinking of, giving
				such medicines as these to your father," said she.</p>
			<p>"I see, plainly enough, that he is in a very inflammable and irritable state, and he
				ought to be put altogether upon the depleting plan." Then putting her finger on her
				lip, in sign of secrecy, she whispered, "I'll just stay here, Martha, behind the
				bed-curtains, till Dr. Crockley comes, and I think it may be very useful for us to
				have a little conversation together. I know my poor dear father's method in these
				cases as well as he did himself, and he was regular bred you know, which is more
				than we can say of poor dear Dr. Crockley."</p>
			<p>Exceedingly provoked, Martha now addressed her father, saying, "Mrs. Gabberly wishes
				to stay, papa, till Dr. Crockley comes, in order that they may have a consultation
				about you; but you won't like that, shall you?"</p>
			<p>"Like it?" replied the prostrate man, with bitterness, "Oh! dear yes, I shall like it
				vastly! They are exactly a fitting pair to come together, glowering and gloating
				round the bed of a ruined neighbour. Let her stay, by all means, Martha, let her
				stay and watch it all. See, Mrs. Gabberly, there is a young auctioneering gentleman
				come to take an account of the furniture. Isn't it pleasant? I am sure it must do
				your heart good to see it. Don't go away, young man!" he continued, addressing
				Michael, who, shocked and disgusted, was making his way towards the door. "Don't go
				away. Go on, never mind losing a little time, I dare say you will be paid for it all
				the same and my dear good neighbour would not enjoy it half so much if she did not
				see something of the kind going on."</p>
			<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! quite wild and wandering! Isn't he? — Calling Crockley and me a
				pair too! As if we ever thought of such a thing! I am sure, for one, I can answer
				for it that I never did. — His doll of a wife, you know, hasn't been dead above a
				year, and I've no notion of such quick work, it is quite indecent, I think. Good
				gracious me, now!" she continued, catching Sir Matthew's fierce eye fixed upon her
				with a mixture of hatred and bitter irony; "what have I said! — I'll bet a guinea he
				fancies I mean something about his marrying himself up, all in such a hurry with
				Lady Clarissa."</p>
			<p> "Lady Clarissa!" cried the knight in a loud voice. "That's right! I had very nearly
				forgotten her ladyship. Go to her this moment, Martha — tell her to come here. Is
				she not my wife — bone of my <pb n="351"/> bone — flesh of my flesh? Is she not,
				Mrs. Gabberly? And shall she not come hither and share with me the delight of seeing
				a broker taking possession of my furniture, and a dear good soul like you looking
				on? Go, Martha, go when I tell you, and bring the right honourable Lady Clarissa
				Dowling here." </p>
			<p>"I am quite certain she won't come, papa," said Martha, leaning down, and whispering
				in his ear. "So don't make me go to her."</p>
			<p>"But she <hi>shall</hi> , though!" shouted Sir Matthew, "even if I go down, and fetch
				her myself. My dear Mrs. Gabberly, my sweet Mrs. Gabberly — will you have the great
				condescension to go for her? You used to run about, if I did but hold up my finger,
				you know — and you would not be so ungenerous as to refuse now, merely because I am
				a bankrupt! Go to my Lady Clarissa, if you please, sweet Mrs. Gabberly, and tell her
				that as she is a daughter of the noble house of Highlandloch, I wish, before we
				part, to give her a parting token of remembrance. She knows that I wear a
				magnificent diamond ring, Mrs. Gabberly, and you may just hint to her, if you
				please, that nothing has been taken off my body yet. I do assure you it will be a
				very pretty touching scene for you to witness, and talk about. It will indeed. I am
				quite determined to have a sentimental parting; and as she has told me that she
				means to set off to-morrow, this will be just the right time for it — won't it, Mrs.
				Gabberly?"</p>
			<p>Perfectly well disposed to execute the commission, and quite as desirous as Sir
				Matthew could be that the proud poor lady who had ever treated her with haughty
				coldness, should be properly humbled, she darted towards the door, in order to
				perform her errand; but Martha, remembering the manner in which she had left her
				step-mother engaged, stepped forward to prevent her, quietly saying, "If my father
				wishes to see his wife, Mrs. Gabberly, I can go for her, without troubling you — and
				I really wish you would permit me to lead you down stairs to your donkey-chair, at
				the same time — I am sure you must be aware that papa is not in a state to bear
				seeing company."</p>
			<p>"You are quite right, my dear, quite right, indeed — Sir Matthew is looking sadly
				wild and feverish, and I should say that nobody whatever but the doctor and his own
				family ought to see him. Of course I suppose it would not be very convenient to hire
				attendants now, for these sort of people, I am sorry to say, always insist upon
				ready money, which is a cruel thing under such circumstances. But so it is, and
				therefore it follows that you and Lady Clarissa must be the chief nurses."</p>
			<p>"Certainly, ma'am, it will be his own family who will wish to attend to him. And
				therefore, if you please, I will take you down stairs, and see you to your
				carriage."</p>
			<p> "Me! my dear!" cried Mrs. Gabberly, in the shrillest possible tone. "Surely you
				cannot mean to call such an old friend as I am, company? No, no, my dear Martha.
				Don't think me such a brute! I would not leave you just yet, for the whole world!
				You shall go yourself, my dear, if you will, and bring her ladyship up. I will stay
				here as quiet as a mouse, and watch by your poor papa. But perhaps it might be as
				well to desire that young man to finish with his scribbling, <pb n="352"/> and get
				out of the room. He must have gone over every thing by this time, mustn't he?" </p>
			<p>"I will have her right honourable ladyship here before that fellow stirs a step,
				Martha. Do you hear me? That's more than half the fun," cried Sir Matthew, bursting
				into a shout of laughter. "Doesn't she know our kind, clever, observing, neighbour,
				who is come here so thoughtfully, just to look about her a little? Doesn't she know
				her, almost as well as I do? And won't she enjoy thinking what a pleasant
				description dear Mrs. Gabberly will be able to give of my Lord Highlandloch's sweet
				daughter watching the broker, and seeing that he sets every thing down fair?"</p>
			<p>Thankful was Martha that the supposed broker was one who could not in reality add to
				the horror of the scene. She turned to him as she left the room, saying, "You had
				better remain here, if you please, till I return," upon which he modestly ensconced
				himself in a distant corner of the room, and resting his paper upon a commode,
				continued, as he stood, to scribble upon it.</p>
			<p>Quite certain that it would be impossible to get rid of Mrs. Gabberly till her
				father's summons to his proud wife had been obeyed, and greatly more anxious to
				clear his room of this troublesome guest, than to spare the feelings of her
				ladyship, Martha entered the little sittingroom, determined to deliver the message
				concerning the diamond-ring, if she could not prevail without it. She found Lady
				Clarissa in the act of finishing the packing of her basket, by laying on the top of
				it sundry light articles of female attire, very cleverly calculated to make the
				whole pass under the general description of wearing-apparel, which the courtesy of
				the law permits to be removed by all persons in the unfortunate situation of her
				ladyship.</p>
			<p>"Now I hope you will cease your impertinent preaching, Miss Martha," she said, as the
				pale and agitated young woman entered the room. "Unless every separate nightcap and
				frill are to be examined one by one by these brutes, I conceive no objection can be
				made to this package. Gather up the cotton-wool, and poke it somewhere out of sight
				directly." Martha obediently set herself to collect the scattered fragments of the
				suspicious-looking wool, but as she did so, said, "My father wishes to see you, Lady
				Clarissa."</p>
			<p>"Insolent wretch!" exclaimed her ladyship, pausing in the act of collecting various
				little articles for which she had not found room in the basket, "have you the
				audacity to bring me this as a message?"</p>
			<p>"My father says, Lady Clarissa, that as you are going to leave him to-morrow, he
				should wish to see you once more," replied Martha.</p>
			<p> "Monster!" screamed Lady Clarissa stamping her foot upon the floor, "he, see me
				again? he, dare to lift his bankrupt eyes upon the noble woman he has so basely
				injured? — Tell him, you bold messenger, who fear not to face the descendant of a
				dozen earls to convey to her the words of a bankrupt cotton-spinner, tell him, that
				the only atonement he can make, is TO DIE. Tell him, this from me! — and may the
				ostentatious settlement his unprincipled pride made on me, <pb n="353"/> excuse me
				in some degree in the eyes of my noble brother, for the degradation I brought upon
				him by accepting it!" These last words were uttered with clasped hands, raised eyes,
				fervent accents, and all other ordinary indications of uttering a prayer. </p>
			<p>Indignant and disgusted, Martha felt no scruple in employing the means her father had
				given her for obtaining the interview he desired, and quietly said in reply to this
				burst, "My father stated that his motive for asking to see you, Lady Clarissa,
				proceeded from his wish to present to you, as a parting gift, the diamond ring which
				he wears on his right hand."</p>
			<p>The effect of these words was as sudden as that produced by the magic touch of a hand
				employed in turning off gas.</p>
			<p>"That indeed is a most natural wish! Unhappy, guilty man! I can well believe that had
				he the crown jewels at command, he would deem them all too poor an offering to atone
				for the offence he has committed against me! I thank God, Martha Dowling, that my
				noble blood has never taught me to forget that I am a Christian! There are many
				women, believe me there are, of less exalted rank than myself, who would not deign
				to obey such a summons. But I feel what my duties are, and I shall nerve my courage
				to perform them. Come with me to my dressing-room, Martha, carry that basket for me,
				and then I will go with you to the bedside of Sir Matthew."</p>
			<p>Martha attempted to obey, but the basket was too heavy for her to carry, and she set
				it down again, declaring that the task was beyond her strength.</p>
			<p>"A tolerably good joke that," said Lady Clarissa, endeavouring to laugh, "considering
				your origin; but this is the last day of such pleasant jestings, and therefore I
				must bear it with good humour I suppose." Then applying her own much stronger hand,
				she lifted her treasure, and was stalking off with it; but stopped short ere she
				reached the door, saying, "No, I will stay here while you go and fetch my faithful
				Mistress Saunderson. She enters into all my feelings! thank God! and is as strong as
				a Highland pony into the bargain." Having obediently performed this commission, and
				brought back the faithful Scotch waiting-woman, who had adhered very steadfastly to
				her mistress through all the vicissitudes of her fortune, Martha at length succeeded
				in marshalling the Lady Clarissa Dowling into the bedroom of her husband.</p>
			<p>No signet-ring ever made a deeper impression on wax, than the diamond one of Sir
				Matthew had done on the memory of his noble wife; and her first glance, as she
				entered the room, was directed to the hand which lay on the bedclothes, that she
				might see if it had been already removed; but on! there it sparkled still, and with
				a gentler aspect than she had been seen to wear since the tremendous hour when the
				declension of Sir Matthew, from the richest commoner in the county into a bankrupt,
				had been announced to her, she said,</p>
			<p>"You wish to see me, Sir Matthew — Martha says you wish to see me."</p>
			<pb n="354"/>
			<p>"Yes my beloved!" replied the knight. "I do wish to see you. Angelic sweetness! How
				can I do otherwise? Look at yourself in the mirror, most beautiful Clarissa? Look in
				the mirror before that broker there carries it off, and tell me if you think it
				possible that any man could bear to part with so much beauty, without having one
				final gaze upon it? And see, my dear, here is your amiable neighbour Mrs. Gabberly!
				Is it not kind of her to leave all other visitings, that she may come to nestle
				herself here, among the very brokers, in the very centre of our misery? It is so
				heavenly-minded of her, isn't it? I guessed indeed that one great reason for her
				making such a tremendous sacrifice was the hope of edification from beholding the
				christian spirit with which your ladyship bears your ladyship's overthrow; and
				besides her own improvement from it, she wishes to have it in her power to describe
				it to the whole neighbourhood. Very right of her, isn't it, my dear? And that is the
				reason why I sent for you."</p>
			<p>In general the nose of Lady Clarissa greatly outblushed her cheeks, which had more of
				the jonquil than the rose in them; but now, from the tip of her high forehead, to
				that of her long chin, she became crimson; and but from the remarkable length of her
				throat, which seemed to rear itself in defiance of such danger, a fit of apoplexy
				might have been expected.</p>
			<p>"Begone! you vulgar gossip-picker!" she cried, turning in uncontrollable rage upon
				the terrified little woman, "and tell the contemptible neighbourhood through which
				you are going to crawl in your donkey-cart, like a snail in his shell, leaving your
				slime as you go, tell them all, from me, that the best consolation under my remorse
				at having forgotten my own dignity by condescending to hold a place among them,
				arises from being released from the degradation of associating with so contemptible
				a being as yourself, and all who are capable of listening to you!" And having
				uttered these words in a piercing voice, she rushed to the door, threw it with great
				violence wide open, and so left it, as she paced, with rapid but tragic strides, to
				the shelter of her own boudoir, and the sympathy of Mistress Saunderson.</p>
			<p>It was, perhaps, because the door was open, and that he knew the sound would follow
				her, that Sir Matthew burst into the most violent shout of laughter that ever made
				itself heard from mortal lungs; it terrified Martha, made Michael Armstrong shudder,
				and caused Mrs. Gabberly herself to wish she were any where else, notwithstanding
				the very valuable information this extraordinary scene would enable her to
				communicate. Long did this frightful laugh continue, and when strength seemed to
				fail, and the boisterous merriment could be sustained no longer, a vehement and
				reiterated hissing followed, which at length ended in such complete exhaustion that
				Sir Matthew fell back pale, and apparently motionless, upon his pillow.</p>
			<p>"Mrs. Gabberly," said Martha, "I must beg you to leave us now. You must perceive that
				my poor father ought to be alone. It is very important — fearfully important, I am
				afraid — that he should be kept perfectly quiet! Give me leave to wish you good
				morning."</p>
			<p> "I must say that it does seem very odd in you, Miss Martha, to persist <pb n="355"/>
				in calling me <hi>company</hi> . Good gracious! To think of the terms on which I
				have always been in this house before your poor papa's unfortunate marriage! I
				cannot and I will not leave you in such a condition. It would be perfectly
				monstrous, and every body would call me a brute for it. Till Dr. Crockley has been
				here, I really neither can nor will go. I am quite determined that I will hear what
				he says about him." </p>
			<p>"Let her stay," said Sir Matthew, in a hollow whisper, which proved that he was
				neither asleep nor dead, though his closed eyes, and ghastly countenance, might have
				been mistaken for one state or the other.</p>
			<p>Martha went to him, took his hand, wiped the profuse perspiration from his brow, and
				then placing herself in a chair beside him, continued to watch his altered
				countenance, alike unmindful as it seemed of the presence of Mrs. Gabberly, or that
				of Michael either.</p>
			<p>The lady, perfectly contented to be thus quietly established as a looker-on,
				determined, for the present, neither to move'nor speak, lest she might lose the
				valued privilege thereby; but Michael became so conscious of the awkwardness of his
				situation, and so fearful lest Martha, from forgetting him, might get into a scrape
				likewise, that he ventured to approach the foot of the bed on tiptoe, merely for the
				purpose of recalling himself to her recollection, and then, on seeing her start at
				the sight of him, he said in a whisper, "I suppose I had better go down stairs now,
				Miss Martha?"</p>
			<p>Martha in reply to this nodded affirmatively, and in the same low tone added, "I
				shall have other business to speak to you about. Do not go away till you have seen
				me."</p>
			<p>Michael's eyes were naturally turned to Martha while this passed; but when he
				withdrew them, and was about to make his retreat, he caught the large, wide open,
				wild-looking eyes of Sir Matthew fixed earnestly upon him. The young man
				involuntarily dropped his eyelids, for the gaze was a frightful one, and turned to
				leave the room.</p>
			<p>"Stay!" roared a hoarse but loud and stunning voice from the bed. "Stay! devil!
				demon! hell-bird! what do you come here for? Cowardly blackguard! Do you think I do
				not know you? You never dared to come till it was too late for me to hold you! I
				have heard of your purring round the place weeks ago. But you escaped me then, base
				runaway! What do you come spying here for? Did you think I should not know ye? Did
				you think I should forget those d — d hypocritical eyes, and that hateful curly
				hair, of the devil's own colour? No, my pretty 'prentice, I have not forgotten your
				crocodile looks, and never shall. I suppose you thought you should bring me to
				repentance by sending home word that you were dead. Was that it, eh?"</p>
			<p> "I am able now, Sir Matthew, to pay for leaving the mill before my time, and I am
				quite ready to do it, if you please," replied Michael, gently. But he spoke to one
				who heard him not. Sir Matthew had a neck as short and thick as that of his lady was
				long and thin. His last interview with her had not been a salutary one for a man in
				his <pb n="356"/> state of mind and body; and the subsequent discovery of Michael,
				of whose visit to the factory he had heard from Parsons, and at whose escape he
				expressed the most unbridled rage, accelerated symptoms which had before threatened
				him, and sent such a rush of blood to the brain as instantly produced apoplexy, and
				left him totally deprived of sense and motion. </p>
			<p>Martha, whose eyes were fixed upon him, uttered a fearful shriek, and threw herself
				on the body, believing that he was dead. But Mrs. Gabberly knew better. She had
				practised too long as an amateur not to know a fit of apoplexy when she saw it, and
				promptly exclaimed, "Get away, Martha! Get off of him, child! He is not dead, I tell
				you, and, if we could but bleed him, he would open his eyes again fast enough."</p>
			<p>With the rapidity of lightning poor Martha obeyed. She withdrew herself from the bed,
				endeavoured to raise her father in her arms, and, by the help of Michael, succeeded.
				She then bared his arm, bound her own waist-belt tightly round it, and with
				unshrinking courage had thrust a sharp penknife which she drew from her pocket into
				a vein, before the skillful lady who had prescribed the measure had half recovered
				her astonishment on perceiving that the poor girl had conceived the project of
				putting it into immediate execution.</p>
			<p>The old adage that "where there is a will, there is a way," was never better
				illustrated than by this act of the tender-hearted and invalided Martha. She felt
				that her father's life hung on the promptness with which the operation was
				performed; she felt too, that if she shrunk from it, there was no one else who would
				perform it, and totally forgetful of herself and her own feelings conquered the
				rebellious weakness that would have held her hand, and did what two minutes before
				she would have believed it utterly impossible she could have done. The result did
				honour to the skill of Mrs. Gabberly. The lazy current flowed, though reluctantly.
				Sir Matthew opened his large eyes, rolled them from side to side, heaved a deep and
				heavy sigh, and presently attempted to speak, but this was beyond his power.</p>
			<p>"What more should be done?" said the pale, and now trembling Martha, turning towards
				Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
			<p>"Why now, my dear, you must just let him alone for a little bit," replied the
				physician by hereditary right. "Well now!" she added, "Wasn't it a blessing that I
				was here? If I had not staid, he would have been as dead as mutton by this
				time."</p>

			<p>A FRIENDLY CONSULTATION — A DANGEROUS EMBASSY — LADY CLARISSA RECEIVES SOME
				DISAGREEABLE INTELLIGENCE — AN AWKWARD CONTEST — UNPLEASANT VISIONS — A FITTING
				TERMINATION TO THE CONFIDENTIAL UNION BETWEEN MASTER AND MAN.</p>
			<p>
				Such was the state of affairs in the bedroom of Sir Matthew
				Dowling, when Dr. Crockley entered it. Were all the words which Mrs. Gabberly then
				uttered in explanation of what she had done, why she had done it, and how her doings
				had answered, to be written down here, my waning pages would hardly suffice to
				contain them. Dr. Crockley nodded, winked, approved, and applauded a great deal,
				joked a little, and finally felt the patient's pulse, observing at the same time
				that it was necessary at any rate to bring him round sufficiently to get a little
				talk on business out of him, before he popped off for good and all.</p>
			<p>"Very right and proper if you can manage it, doctor," sagaciously observed Mrs.
				Gabberly. "But you may depend upon it, that — " and here she whispered something,
				that it was especially intended Martha should be neither the better nor the worse
				for. The doctor nodded and winked, and nodded again; and then turning to the poor
				girl who was not only the one who alone in that presence cared any thing for the
				prostrate millocrat, but the one of all created beings who would alone have felt his
				death to be a cause of mourning. Dr. Crockley turned to her, and with very little of
				even the external decency of sympathy said, "Do you think you can manage to get some
				mustard, my dear, out of the clutches of the bailiffs? — because that is what we
				want here."</p>
			<p>Without answering, Martha moved towards the door; and Michael, not conceiving that
				the physician's words were but a brutal jest, and fancying that Martha might really
				have to petition those who now held authority in the household for the article
				wanted, stepped after her, to request that he might execute the commission in her
				place.</p>
			<p>"You shall come down with me, Michael," she replied, "and I doubt not you will be
				able to procure what we want without difficulty. But alas! Michael, it will avail
				nothing — I am sure by their whispering, that they both know it will avail nothing!
				Nevertheless it shall be tried. But is it not dreadful that of all his numerous
				family there should be only one to receive his dying breath? O God!" she added with
				clasped hands and streaming eyes, "if it be a judgment, let it atone for all that
				has been wrong! For surely it is a heavy one!"</p>
			<p> On reaching the hall, the pitying Michael, who in the sufferings of his friend
				forgot all the cruelty of his enemy, insisted upon going alone into the thronged and
				noisy offices, while she sat down to wait for his return. He did his errand
				promptly, and was by her side again <pb n="358"/> in a minute or two; but he found
				that she had left the chair on which he had placed her, and was now pacing up and
				down the hall in violent agitation. </p>
			<p>"I am overpowered, I am borne down by all this horror — this deep and bitter grief!"
				she exclaimed. "And there is not a single human being near me, but your ill-used
				self, Michael, from whom I am likely to find any real kindnessl The conduct of all
				with whom I have had intercourse since my poor father's distresses came upon him,
				has been such as to make me wish rather to shun, than seek them at this awful
				moment, yet I want some one to tell me how I ought to act. I know that fearful man
				Parsons, who is greatly in his confidence, had business of importance to settle with
				him; for again and again my father has said to me, since the execution has been in
				the house, that let what would happen, he must find time to speak to him. Ought I
				not then to send to him in this extremity?"</p>
			<p>"Would to Heaven I were fitter to advise you, my dear Miss Martha!" replied Michael,
				with equal respect and tenderness. "Certainly if such were your father's words, it
				is very right to remember them. Shall I go to the factory and summon Mr. Parsons
				hither?"</p>
			<p>"Oh! It is hateful to me," replied poor Martha, "to call such a being to his
				deathbed! But it may be that the interests of others are at stake, and when I recall
				my father's earnestness as he spoke of the necessity of seeing him, I tremble at the
				idea of disobeying him. Go then, Michael! hasten to the factory, and tell this man
				that his master is very ill, but that if he recovers his senses and his speech, it
				is probable he may wish to speak to him."</p>
			<p>Michael lost no time in obeying her; and on reaching the mills found the
				superintendent, as usual, at his post. At the first glance he did not recognise the
				messenger, for the appearance of the young man was greatly changed by the style of
				equipment which, under the advice of Mr. Bell, had been provided for him. No sooner
				did Michael speak, however, than the man started, as if he had been shot.</p>
			<p>"Sir Matthew send <hi>you?</hi> " he exclaimed, "what mountebank tricks are you got
				at now, you young villain? What! did you think that this fine toggery could
				bamboozle me? Has it really bamboozled him? Have you, faith and troth, contrived to
				pass yourself off upon your dearly-beloved benefactor as a gentleman of fashion and
				fortune who was come to make him a visit of condolence upon his misfortunes? A
				capital fellow, ain't you? or, perhaps, my nice young grandee, you fancy his
				grinders are drawn, and that he can't, or won't, maybe, have any thing to do, now
				that he has fallen into trouble, with putting such an elegant young gentleman to
				inconvenience? Is that it? But it is just possible that other people may be more at
				leisure. Who knows?"</p>
			<p> "Never mind me now, Mr. Parsons," replied Michael, utterly indifferent, at that
				moment, to any thing, and every thing, that his old enemy might attempt for the
				purpose of annoying him. "Never think of me or my affairs, at such a time as this.
				You have given me no <pb n="359"/> opportunity to speak, or you would have
				understood that it was not Sir Matthew who sent me here, but his daughter. Sir
				Matthew was too ill, when I left the house, to know any thing about it; but Miss
				Martha thinks that, if he recovers his speech and senses, he may wish to speak to
				you." </p>
			<p>"Like enough!" replied the superintendent with a sneer. "Sir Matthew's troubles have
				nowise changed his nature. The young lady is quite right: but I shouldn't have
				thought as he'd have told her any thing about it, either. Not but what she might
				approve the job, too, if she had got any spirit in her. But she is but a poor,
				puling sort of a cretur, much as she was when she used to cosset you, my beautiful
				master runaway apprentice. However, never mind that now, as you say, my pretty
				master; there's a time for all things. You may just step in here while I change my
				coat. It bean't the first time as you have entered this pleasant building, Master
				Mike, is it?"</p>
			<p>Michael was going to obey him; but, at the moment he was about to pass the threshold,
				something in the eye of the superintendent made him pause. He recollected full well
				the ready lock of that once hated door; and it struck him, as by no means
				impossible, that his old acquaintance might turn it upon him, if he put it in his
				power to do so.</p>
			<p>Fears for his own personal safety, he certainly had none, being quite aware that he
				was no longer in danger of being kidnapped as heretofore; but the idea of Martha
				being left, at this her utmost need, in want of any little service he could afford,
				was quite enough to make him cautious, and with something of an involuntary smile,
				he stepped back, saying, "There is no occasion for me to wait for you, Mr. Parsons;
				I have delivered my message, and you may obey it or not, as you please. At any rate,
				you cannot want me to show you the way to Dowling Lodge," And so saying, he turned
				round, and walked out of the yard.</p>
			<p>"Pestilent young viper!" muttered the superintendent between his closed teeth. "That
				I should live to see him strut off before me in that fashion! But I'll have a try if
				I can't plague him yet. Fool that I was, when I had him snug by myself on Ridgetop
				Moor, not to give him one farewell thrashing with the horsewhip! If I had put out a
				joint or two, it would have been no great matter; and then I should have been spared
				the d — d sight of him now, marching off — hang him! like a peacock before me! As to
				changing my coat, that's fudge. People don't trouble themselves to change their
				coats, when they are going to pay their compliments to an apoplectic bankrupt."</p>
			<p>Having fairly got beyond all the bolts and bars immediately within the jurisdiction
				of Mr. Parsons, Michael slackened his pace, being rather inclined to have the
				society of his former tyrant, than not. "Sir Matthew appears to be in a very
				dangerous state, Mr. Parsons," said he, as soon as the sulky superintendent came up
				to him.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps your right honourable greatness has been studying medicine, since I had the
				pleasure of taking that little drive with you into Derbyshire?"</p>
			<pb n="360"/>
			<p>"I have studied many things since that time, Mr. Parsons," replied Michael, laughing;
				"and one is the nature and use of locks."</p>
			<p>The tone in which this was answered was so brutal, that the young man, rather from
				disgust than anger, walked on faster than his foe could follow him; and reaching the
				house some minutes before him, made his way again without ceremony — for it was no
				time for it — into the apartment of Sir Matthew. A considerable change had taken
				place in the condition of the patient since he left it. The cataplasms had so far
				succeeded as to restore animation and consciousness: Sir Matthew, still surrounded
				by Martha, Mrs. Gabberly, and the doctor, was gazing upon them with widely-opened
				eyes, which, though wild and wandering in expression, were evidently not devoid of
				speculation. Michael had entered very gently, but not without being heard by the
				sick man; for he turned his eyes full upon him as he approached. The sight of him,
				however, no longer seemed to produce any emotion; for after looking quietly at him
				for a moment, Sir Matthew turned his gaze upon Mrs. Gabberly, who from being in the
				act of leaning over him, brought herself particularly within his sight.</p>
			<p>"Is Parsons come?" said Martha in a whisper.</p>
			<p>"He must be in the hall by this time," replied Michael: "shall I tell him to come
				up?"</p>
			<p>"My dear father has not yet spoken," she said; "but, perhaps, he may understand me. —
				Parsons is here, papa," she added, taking her father's hand, and leaning over him —
				"should you like to see him?"</p>
			<p>"He is in London, my dear," replied the knight very distinctly.</p>
			<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Martha, tenderly kissing him — "Thank God! His speech is not
				in the least affected!"</p>
			<p>"Rather wandering, though," said Dr. Crockley, winking his eye at Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
			<p>"I should say, bleed him again, if you want to get any thing out of him;" observed
				Mrs. Gabberly, looking sagaciously at the doctor.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps I may, in an hour or two," he replied, applying his finger to the patient's
				pulse.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew fixed his eyes upon him, and laughed a horrid, rattling, ghastly sort of
				laugh, that seemed to come from his throat. "You haven't quite done with me yet,
				have you, Crockley?" said he.</p>
			<p>"Done with you, my dear friend? God forbid!" replied the physician, rather startled
				at the apparently healthy state of his patient's intellect, and affectionately
				smoothing his pillows, and settling the bedclothes about him.</p>
			<p>"Would you like to see Parsons, dear papa?" said Martha, gently, and again bending
				over him.</p>
			<p>"Oh, yes!" he replied eagerly; "I'll see Parsons now, directly — I should be very
				sorry not to see Parsons. I may live, or I may die, you know; but I must see
				Parsons.</p>
			<p> Martha immediately left the room, intending to explain to the superintendent, before
				she brought him into it, the state in which her father lay, and the necessity of
				receiving any orders he might wish to <pb n="361"/> give, with as little disturbance
				to him as possible. On reaching the hall, however, she saw him not, and was on the
				point of returning up stairs to inquire of Michael where he had left him, when she
				caught the sound of his voice from Sir Matthew's study. On entering this room she
				perceived not only Mr. Parsons but Lady Clarissa, who, standing before the commode
				in which, as she happened to know, her husband was accustomed to keep papers of
				importance, as well as money, appeared to have been very assiduously examining its
				contents; for every recess had evidently been visited, and, as one of her hands was
				tightly clutched over a pocket-book, it seemed that her researches had not been
				wholly in vain, and that she had not privately obtained possession of his keys for
				nothing. </p>
			<p>"I was sent for, my lady," said Parsons, apparently replying to some question of her
				ladyship's, which, to judge by her angry frown, and the vexed expression of her
				countenance, had not been a civil one.</p>
			<p>"My father wishes to see Mr. Parsons directly," said Martha.</p>
			<p>"And by your ladyship's leave I must take that green pocket-book with me," said
				Parsons.</p>
			<p>"What pocket-book, you rude fellow?" replied Lady Clarissa, indignantly.</p>
			<p>"That one as your ladyship now holds in your left hand," replied the confidential
				superintendent.</p>
			<p>"I wonder, sirrah, that you do not ask me to give you the rings off my fingers!"
				cried the angry mistress of the mansion. "Go to your master, fellow, if he has sent
				for you, and I shall go too. So you need not trouble yourself about the
				pocket-book."</p>
			<p>And with these words she pushed past both Martha and Mr. Parsons, preceding them to
				the sick man's chamber. By the time they entered it his eyes were again closed, but
				he appeared to breathe without difficulty, though rather more audibly than usual,
				and Martha fancied that he was asleep.</p>
			<p>"Hush!" said she. "Do not disturb him. He is sleeping."</p>
			<p>Dr. Crockley and Mrs. Gabberly had withdrawn to a window, and were evidently in
				consultation; but whether on the symptoms of apoplexy, or bankruptcy, might be
				doubtful. Michael, however, was standing close beside the bed, and in answer to
				Martha's observation shook his head, saying, "No! not asleep."</p>
			<p>"Then he'll manage to hear what I've got to say to him," said Parsons, advancing, and
				throwing a glance of spiteful vengeance at Lady Clarissa, "because it is just what
				he wants to know."</p>
			<p>At the sound of Parsons's voice Sir Matthew opened his eyes, and made an effort to
				raise himself, but this was beyond his power, and it was only by being lifted with
				as little effort as possible on his own part, as if he were already dead, that he
				was placed in the attitude he seemed to desire, and in which he was supported by
				pillows, and by the arms of poor Martha, who had placed herself on the bolster
				behind him.</p>
			<pb n="362"/>
			<p>It was a frightful and awful expression which then took possession of his sunken
				features, nevertheless a hateful sort of smile made part of it.</p>
			<p>"Parsons! that's you, isn't it? That's Parsons that stands there?" he said, directing
				his misty eyes full upon the superintendent.</p>
			<p>"Yes, Sir Matthew, 'tis me," replied the man.</p>
			<p>"Have you done my bidding, Parsons?" demanded the knight, with a sort of gasping
				which seemed to threaten that his breath was about to leave him.</p>
			<p>"Yes, Sir Matthew, it's all regularly made out," replied Parsons, "nobody can mistake
				now about times or dates in any way."</p>
			<p>"And isn't that the Honourable Lady Clarissa?" said the sick man, directing his eyes
				towards her.</p>
			<p>"Yes, Sir Matthew," replied Parsons, with something like a titter.</p>
			<p>"Then — then — then," panted the dying man, "let her ladyship know what was the last
				business that I gave you instructions about."</p>
			<p>"A very fitting business for an honourable gentleman to attend to, when his affairs
				are in confusion, and he not in an over good state of health," replied the
				confidential servant, turning himself round, so as exactly to face her ladyship. "No
				less a matter than restoring three good thousand pounds a year, for ever, towards
				clearing scores with his creditors."</p>
			<p>Now three thousand pounds a year was exactly the sum, for the settlement of which
				upon herself, a daughter of the noble house of Highlandloch had condescended to
				assume the name of Dowling, and the mention of the often-meditated sum roused her
				ladyship's attention so effectually that her face involuntarily protruded itself
				beyond her body, till her nose very nearly reached that of the individual who was
				addressing her.</p>
			<p>"Go on!" said Sir Matthew, positively chuckling, though his chin dropped on his chest
				as he spoke.</p>
			<p>"Well then," resumed Parsons, leering aside at Dr. Crockley, who with Mrs. Gabberly
				had drawn near to listen to this very interesting disclosure, — "well then, justice
				is justice; and Sir Matthew, let him die when he will, won't have it upon his
				conscience that he defrauded his creditors to make a settlement upon any lady in the
				land, gentle or simple; because you see he has left proof, plain and clear, that he
				had committed more than one act of bankruptcy before he made the settlement upon her
				ladyship, and for that good and excellent reason her ladyship will have no right to
				one single penny that he leaves behind him; and that is a comfort to an honest man
				like me, who likes to see justice done to high and low."</p>
			<p>"Villain!" screamed Lady Clarissa, "it is false!"</p>
			<p>"No, no, no, no!" issued from the pillows, in a voice that shook with ghastly
				laughter. "True, all true; and now she may go to Scotland."</p>
			<p> "Just ask her to give you your green pocket-book, Sir Matthew, <pb n="363"/> before
				she goes," said Parsons, grinning. "I saw her ladyship take it out of your bureau,
				and if she will be pleased to open her hand, I think it will tumble out of it." </p>
			<p>With a look of inexpressible rage, Lady Clarissa turned away from him and made
				towards the door.</p>
			<p>"Stop her, Crockley!" cried Sir Matthew, feebly, adding with panting difficulty, "and
				— you — shall — have — it."</p>
			<p>Dr. Crockley had a great respect for the peerage, and would, beyond all question,
				have preferred snatching a pocket-book from nine hundred and ninety-nine untitled
				ladies in succession, rather than from one Lady Clarissa; but he felt that this was
				no moment for ceremony, and obeying what was very likely to be the last behest of
				his patron, he rolled his fat person after her with extraordinary muscular exertion,
				and grasping the lady's robe with one hand, seized on her rigidly clenched fist with
				the other, in such a sort, that, according to the prophecy of Mr. Parsons, the green
				pocket-book dropped out of it.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, however, the attitude in which this feat was performed, was one which
				could not be retained by the ill-balanced person of the doctor, after the supporting
				form of the lady on whom he had thrown himself had escaped from his grasp, and,
				struggling with as much anxious care as Cæsar to fall well <hi>i.e.</hi> upon the
				pocket-book), he measured his length upon the ground.</p>
			<p>Parsons, though certainly not hoping for so lucky an accident, had, with the same
				sort of instinct which brings the crow beside a sickly sheep, followed closely the
				retreating steps of her ladyship, and adroitly jerking the coveted pocket-book with
				his foot, so that it should escape the being buried under the stumbling physician,
				prepared himself to dip and catch it. But the success of the manoeuvre was less
				perfect than its ingenuity deserved; for ere his tall rigid person had bent itself
				sufficiently for him to reach the ground, Mrs. Gabberly, who had become one of the
				group at the same instant with Dr. Crockley, was in possession of it, and ere the
				prostrate Crockley or the stooping Parsons could raise their eyes, the prize had
				dropped into the deepest recesses of a prodigious pocket, which reached nearly to
				the bottom of her little petticoat.</p>
			<p> It is probable that both inquiry and search might have been instituted in
				consequence of this, had not the condition of the patient at that moment rendered it
				impossible. Sir Matthew's ghastly eyes had fixed themselves on Lady Clarissa during
				the foregoing scene, but as if, though they had still the power of discerning
				objects, they had lost that of moving after them, he appeared to lose sight of her
				as she approached the door, and the heavy orbs seemed seeking for something on which
				to rest themselves without any change of position. It chanced that Michael, who,
				quite aware that the last moments of Sir Matthew were approaching, determined not to
				leave the premises till he had learned the wishes and intentions of Martha, was at
				that moment moving from the corner he had occupied near a window, not within sight
				of the bed, to a table exactly at the foot of it, on which <pb n="364"/> was placed
				a <hi>flacon</hi> of Cologne water, which poor Martha, almost exhausted by the
				painful attitude necessary to sustain the pillows, had made him a sign to get for
				her. This movement brought him within the range of Sir Matthew's eyes, and something
				in his aspect as he cautiously bent to take the bottle, or else the thick-coming
				fancies of a brain diseased, though not paralyzed, suddenly produced a terrible
				effect upon the dying man, and he uttered a cry so harsh and terrible as to
				constrain the attention even of the preoccupied group at the door. </p>
			<p>"There's a dead body walking about the room!" he ejaculated in an unnatural and
				frightful accent. "He is come for me! and I must go!" The shriek which followed
				these words was terrible. In a minute or two he spoke again, but almost in a
				whisper. "One? No! — it is not one, it is five hundred! Take them! — take them away
				from me, I tell you! They are all dirty, beastly factory-children. Their arms and
				legs are all broken and smashed, and hanging by bits of skin. Take them away, I tell
				you, Crockley! Their horrid joints will drop upon me! They are dangling and loose, I
				tell you!" and then again he shouted with so fearful a cry, that even Parsons
				pressed his hands upon his ears to save them from the sound.</p>
			<p>"Calm him! calm him!" cried the trembling Martha. "Can you not give him something
				that may still this dreadful agony, Doctor Crockley?"</p>
			<p>"It is not a very easy symptom to master, Miss Martha," replied the physician drily.
				"However, it is not likely that it will last long. All the life that's left is just
				about the heart and brain, which is always unlucky if there happens to be any thing
				particular upon the mind."</p>
			<p>"Parsons!" cried the dying man, again raising his voice, but without looking towards
				the person he addressed. "Parsons! are you not ashamed of yourself to turn the whole
				set of them out upon me at once in this way? You that have paid, and bribed, and
				tipped so often! Rascal! Take them off me, I tell you! Do you mean that they shall
				stifle me? They will stifle me? — they will, they will. I cannot breathe for them!
				Parsons! — I tell you they will stifle me!"</p>
			<p>"Papa! my dear, dear papa!" cried Martha, bending forward till her cheek touched that
				of her father. "Compose yourself! It is only that you are unwell and fancy things.
				There are no children here, papa, but your own Martha."</p>
			<p>Her tender caresses, and her gentle voice together, seemed to reach, and quiet for a
				moment his wandering intellect. He made an effort to turn his head towards her, but
				that was impossible; and Michael, who had, upon his first frightful cry, removed
				himself to the head of the bed, where the eye of the wretched man could not reach,
				silently offered to take Martha's place, that she might station herself where it
				could. She quickly understood him, and in a moment stood where that dying eye could
				gaze upon her. His hand, with its glittering ring, still lay upon the bed; she took
				it in hers, and fondly chafed and kissed it. But it was stiff and cold as
				marble!</p>
			<p> "Father! dearest father!" she said, "speak one word to me!" <pb n="365"/> But it was
				too late; his lips never opened more. For some hours longer he continued to breathe,
				but, on again feeling his pulse, Dr. Crockley declared that its faint pulsations
				must inevitably cease before night. </p>
			<p>"I suppose your old servant Betty Parker is still in the house, Miss Martha?" said
				he. The poor girl bowed an affirmative, but had no power to speak.</p>
			<p>"Well, then," said the doctor, "I should recommend that you should put her to sit
				here; it is no good for any of us to stay any longer, for it's all over just as much
				as if he was already in his coffin. You had better go away, and see what you can
				pack up to get off with, Miss Martha, that's all that is left to be done, as far as
				I can see. Come, Mrs. Gabberly," he added, "I have got a friendly word or two to say
				to you, so your boy shall mount my pony and I'll drive your donkey for you." And so
				saying, he took the little woman under his arm and trudged off, without waiting for
				her to inform him whether she approved his proposal, or not. Mr. Parsons, giving one
				scowling look at the silent bed, followed them, and Martha and Michael were left
				together beside the dying man.</p>
			<p>Upon perceiving the totally unconscious state into which Sir Matthew had fallen,
				Michael had gently withdrawn himself from behind his pillows, and now stood, almost
				as silent and motionless as himself, beside the bed, respectfully waiting to receive
				from the desolate and weeping martha some hint or instruction respecting his staying
				where he was, or leaving her. Never, when the poor dependant of her family, had the
				young heart of Michael been impressed with a feeling of respect so profound as he at
				that moment felt for the unhappy girl. In truth the feeling was so powerful as to
				interfere with his usefulness, for he shrank from appearing to put himself forward
				too presumptuously by giving her advice, or venturing in any degree to dictate what
				it might be best for her to do. But when, after remaining thus bashfully silent for
				a quarter of an hour, he perceived that she gave no other sign of life than by tears
				that flowed incessantly, and sighs that seemed to heave her breast "almost to
				bursting," — when he saw this, he began to think that some degree of seeming
				presumption on his part might be better and more profitable for her, whom he would
				really have died to serve, than the continuance of a degree of deference, which must
				render him useless. Approaching, therefore, to the chair on which she had thrown
				herself, he ventured to say, "Miss Martha! where can I find your old servant Betty
				Parker? I remember her very well — she used to be always in the nursery. If you
				would tell me where she is likely to be, I will go for her."</p>
			<p>Poor Martha for a moment ceased to weep, and looked up at him. "Michael Armstrong!"
				she replied, "I am not conscious of ever having injured any human being but
				yourself; and yet you are the only one who is near to support and help me at this
				dreadful hour. God bless you for your kindness, my good boy! Do not go away, Michael
				— that is, I mean, do not leave the house till all is over — indeed, I think you may
				be useful to me!"</p>
			<pb n="366"/>
			<p>"Miss Martha," he returned, "will you trust me to sit here, while you yourself summon
				whomever you may wish to keep you company. I will keep out of sight in case — " and
				here he stopped.</p>
			<p>"His eyes will never open more, Michael!" she replied, while the tears again burst
				forth, "and thank God their last look at me was gentle! But I almost fear to leave
				the room, Michael — I would not that he should breathe his last, and I not by him."
				But Michael, unskilful as he was, felt that the scene was too awful a one for the
				poor girl to be left alone in, and he therefore persisted to declare with the
				authority which such subduing sorrow gives to all around who will take the trouble
				to exercise it, that he would watch by the bedside of her father while she sought
				the old woman mentioned by Dr. Crockley.</p>
			<p>Reluctantly, and unresistingly she consented, and giving a look at the bed that
				seemed to wring her very heart, she quitted the room, leaving Michael Armstrong
				alone with the motionless mass of still living clay, before which he had so often
				trembled.</p>
			<p>How strangely eventful had been the interval between those well-remembered days, and
				the one actually present with him! How extraordinary the change in the circumstances
				of both parties! It was not triumph, but it was thankfulness, which Michael felt, as
				the sense of this came fully upon him during these moments of profound stillness;
				and the result of all the moving thoughts that crowded upon his mind was an earnest
				prayer to Heaven that he might never be placed in any circumstances likely to harden
				his heart, and make him the cause of suffering to others, — a fearful and a dreadful
				crime, which he felt, as he gazed with trembling awe on the sunken features of the
				living corse before him, must in the sight of God be held as one of the most daring
				rebellion to his heavenly will of which man is capable.</p>
			<p> Solemn and solitary as was Michael's position in the chamber of Sir Matthew, the
				interval of Martha's absence did not seem long. She returned accompanied by the old
				servant who had been nursery attendant, though never raised to the dignity of nurse,
				from the birth of the eldest child of the family, and who was the only one remaining
				of all the numerous household who retained the slightest feeling of attachment to
				any of them. To her, habit stood in the place of preference, and she might perhaps
				be said to love all the Dowling children, from the eldest to the youngest; a
				sentiment which led her to conceive, as in duty bound, a most hearty detestation of
				their stepmother. It was, therefore, with something very like pleasure that she
				obeyed a summons so solemn and so peremptory as to justify her, even in the judgment
				of Mrs. Saunderson, for laying aside the ironing-box, which she had been playing
				incessantly for two whole days upon the frills and furbelows of Lady Clarissa, in
				order to obey it. On perceiving the condition in which her master lay, Betty Parker
				strongly advised poor Martha to retire, urging the uselessness of her remaining to
				look upon what was so grievous, when a baby might see at half a glance that the poor
				gentleman could not tell friend from foe. But <pb n="367"/> Betty Parker knew little
				of the intensity of Martha's pertinacious love for her unworthy parent, if she
				fancied that her very reasonable remonstrance would produce any effect. Martha
				attempted not even to answer it, but placing herself in a chair close beside the
				bed, remained nearly as motionless as the faintly breathing figure that lay upon it. </p>
			<p>Poor Michael knew not too well what he ought to do next. He felt that he was useless
				there; he knew that he should be stared at, as a very incomprehensible intruder, if
				he descended to the offices. Yet he remembered that his benefactress had bid him not
				to go, and he could not have felt himself more strongly bound to remain, had the
				crime of high treason been involved in his departure. Yet there was something in the
				stupid puzzled look with which Betty Parker regarded him, that vexed his spirit. He
				was conscious that he had no business in that room, and therefore at such a moment
				he ought not to be there. After a few moments of reflection he approached Martha,
				and making so profound a reverence as to convince Betty, that let him be who he
				would, he was a very well-behaved young gentleman, he said, "I will now, Miss
				Martha, go to the inn for an hour or two, and then return to take your orders." A
				look of gratitude was all her reply, and Michael departed.</p>
			<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when he entered the little inn, where the
				postboy, who had driven him from Fairly in the morning, was still waiting his
				orders. "I cannot tell you yet, my lad, when I shall be ready to return," he
				replied, in answer to the boy's questionings.</p>
			<p>"It's all one to me, master," said the driver. "In course I shall be paid
				accordingly."</p>
			<p>"Certainly you will," returned Michael: and he was then left to eat his solitary
				dinner with what appetite he might.</p>
			<p>For three long melancholy hours he employed himself in pacing backwards and forwards
				on the high-road before the little inn, and was beginning to think that time enough
				had elapsed to justify his returning to inquire how matters were going on at Dowling
				Lodge, when the sound of a carriage approaching as it seemed from the park-gates,
				cause him to stop abruptly to listen, and to look.</p>
			<p>The equipage that drew near was a handsome travelling-carriage, though its appearance
				was considerably disfigured by the prodigious quantity of luggage, which was
				fastened by ropes and chains to every part of it. The imperial only formed the
				foundation for a pyramid of trunks and bandboxes, which were piled upon it. The
				servant's-seat behind was loaded to its very utmost capacity with more trunks and
				bandboxes, while, chained below it, was a massive coffer, that looked very like a
				plate-chest, having suspended round its sides, bundles, baskets, and bags
				innumerable. Nor was the interior by any means reserved for live lumber alone, for
				although the rigid figures of Lady Clarissa Dowling, and her waiting-woman,
				Saunderson, were visible in the midst, it appeared to be crammed with every
				imaginable species of property which such a conveyance could transport.</p>
			<pb n="368"/>
			<p>Michael watched the overloaded vehicle roll by with great satisfaction. "Whatever
				happens," thought he, "Miss Martha must be better without her." Relieved by knowing
				that he should not again run the risk of encountering her delectable ladyship,
				Michael immediately took his way to the magnificent mansion she had forsaken, and
				perceiving that the hall-doors stood wide open, preferred passing through them to
				encountering again the motley throng that had taken possession of the offices. But
				instead of finding this portion of the house as quiet and forsaken as he had left
				it, he was startled by hearing, as he mounted the steps of the stately portico, a
				multitude of voices in violent altercation.</p>
			<p>At first he felt disposed to turn away and seek another entrance, but the vehemence
				of the sounds he heard excited his curiosity, and he went on. Instead of one,
				half-a-dozen strangers might have entered without running any risk of having their
				right there challenged; so great was the confusion that reigned; and Michael might
				have passed up the great stairs, and into the chamber which it was his purpose to
				visit, without any difficulty. But he was prevented from taking immediate advantage
				of this, by hearing words which excited new fears for the unfortunate Martha; and,
				ere he had listened many minutes, he became aware that a new creditor had reached
				the lodge after he left it, who had come, armed with proper authority, to arrest the
				knight, dead or alive. Nor did the discussion of this event cause all the uproar;
				for the agents of the parties who had previously sent in the execution were
				threatening with all sorts of punishment, several of the servants, whom they accused
				of having been bribed to assist Lady Clarissa in the removal of many valuables which
				she had no right to take. It was not this part of the tumult, however, that
				interested him; and, having obtained but too clearly the information that Sir
				Matthew was arrested, he once more sought for the unhappy Martha in the dismal
				chamber where he had left her. And there he found her; but with such frightful
				adjuncts to her natural grief, that the state of quiet decent sorrow in which he had
				left her, seemed a condition positively enviable compared to that in which he found
				her now.</p>
			<p>Sir Matthew had breathed his last, and the corpse was already arranged with decency
				upon its stately bed; but, on each side of it stood an officer, whose duty it was to
				violate by their presence the solemn sanctity of that dismal chamber, and to prevent
				the body's being carried to the grave, till the claims of their employer were
				satisfied. In front of her father's corpse, with her troubled eyes (no longer bathed
				in the healing dew of natural sorrow), turning from it to its rude guardians, and
				back again to all that was left of the sinful being she had so fondly, blindly
				loved, — stood the wretched daughter, so sad a spectacle of woe, that it was evident
				the men themselves turned their hard eyes studiously away, because they felt a pang
				of pity as they looked upon her.</p>
			<p> "Come with me, Miss Martha!" cried Michael, unceremoniously seizing her arm. "You
				must not, you cannot remain here. You can do no good, Miss Martha; all is over now!
				You must come <pb n="369"/> away, you must indeed." The only answer that poor Martha
				gave, was forcibly shaking off the hand that held her, and then pointing, first to
				her father's body, and afterwards to the two unseemly attendants who stood beside
				it. </p>
			<p>"It is no use, young man, to strive with her," said Betty, who was still occupied in
				completing some of her lugubrious operations about the bed: "I know her better than
				you do. She will stay here watching him till she is as dead as he is, rather than go
				away, and leave his body to be tended by such as those."</p>
			<p>For a moment Michael really felt all the enervating effects of despair, and stood
				perfectly incapable of even imagining any means of help for the agony which it wrung
				his heart to witness. But, as the old woman pursued her ghastly occupation, she went
				muttering on, expatiating on the sinful and unchristian outrage that was thus
				committed. "And what will the rogue get by it?" she said. "Does he mean to show the
				corpse for a farthing a head to his factory black-guards? Isn't he as big a fool as
				he is knave?"</p>
			<p>"No, mistress, no, by no means," said the friendly defender of Mr. Joseph Parsons: —
				for it was at his suit that the body of Sir Matthew had been arrested. — "You may
				call the superintendent rogue, or knave, or what you will of that kind, and I don't
				suppose that there's many as would contradict you; but, as to his being a fool,
				especially as to the doing what he has done here, that he is not. 'Twas his only
				chance."</p>
			<p>"And how much do you think he'll make of it?" demanded old Betty with a sneer.</p>
			<p>"Why, just the four hundred and sixty-seven pounds as is due to him," replied the
				man.</p>
			<p>To all this poor Martha appeared not to pay the slightest attention, and, in truth,
				neither understood nor heard a word of it; but Michael did, and with sudden
				animation stepped up to the man who had spoken, and whispered in his ear, "Perhaps
				we may be able to settle this business without any further difficulty. Step out of
				the room with me, will you, for a moment: your companion can do all that is
				necessary without you." — "Neither I nor my employer are people to make
				difficulties," replied the man; "and I am quite ready to hear you, young master, if
				you have got any thing to say upon the subject." They accordingly retired together;
				and in a wondrously short space of time the uninitiated Michael was made to
				understand all the circumstances of the case, the most important of which was that
				if, as Mr. Parsons hoped and expected, Miss Martha could find ready money enough
				quietly to pay his little private account with the late Sir Matthew, the arrest
				would be immediately withdrawn, and the body left for her to dispose of it at her
				pleasure.</p>
			<p>"And the sum," said Michael, "is — how much?"</p>
			<p>"Four hundred and sixty-seven pounds," replied the man, "with some little matter, not
				exceeding four or five pounds more, for costs,"</p>
			<p>"Withdraw the arrest," said Michael, "and the money shall be instantly
				forthcoming."</p>
			<pb n="370"/>
			<p>"Let us see the money forthcoming," replied the fellow, grinning, "and the arrest
				shall be instantly withdrawn."</p>
			<p>"Here is the money, sir," said Michael, taking out the pocket-book containing
				Martha's generous donation, and drawing from it notes to the amount demanded.</p>
			<p>"Then the business will be soon settled, young gentleman. May I take the liberty to
				ask your name?"</p>
			<p>"My name is of no consequence whatever, sir," replied Michael. "But lose no time in
				giving me the discharge. Only first enter that chamber with me once again, withdraw
				your companion from his frightful watch, and tell the poor young lady that it is
				over."</p>
			<p>The man readily obeyed, and the mourning, but thankful Martha was once more left with
				her old servant, to watch beside her father's corpse.</p>

			<p>MR. AUGUSTUS DOWLING GIVES HIS SISTER MARTHA NOTICE TO QUIT THE PREMISES; WHICH
				OCCASIONS MICHAEL TO APPEAR IN A NEW CHARACTER — A LONG JOURNEY TAKEN BY NOVICES;
				BUT THEY DO NOT LOSE THEIR WAY, AND ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT LAST.</p>
			<p>
				The circumstances which immediately followed are not of sufficient
				consequence to detain us long. Our old acquaintance, Mr. Augustus, now Major Dowling
				of the — regiment, quartered at the distance of a day's journey, was sent for to get
				through the melancholy business going on in his paternal mansion, as well as he
				could; to give orders respecting the funeral, and to make himself as thoroughly
				acquainted with the real state of his family affairs as circumstances would permit.
				Michael, meanwhile, had taken leave of the weeping Martha without having given her
				the slightest hint as to the means by which Sir Matthew's body had been released.
				Had he not known that the Mr. Augustus, whose kicks and pinches he so well
				remembered, was expected to arrive for the protection of his sister, and of whatever
				property they might still call their own, he would hardly have made up his mind to
				leave her, however conscious he might have been of the doubtful propriety of
				offering such protection as he could give. But it was evident that the poor girl
				thought he had better go, though it was equally so that she parted from him with the
				greatest reluctance.</p>
			<p> "You shall hear from me," she said, "my good Michael, and if it should never be my
				good fortune to see you more, remember me with the same forgiving kindness that you
				have shown through all the dreadful scenes you have witnessed here. You have a good
				and generous heart, Michael, and though I know you suffered much by being <pb n="371"/> present at them, you will always like to remember how greatly your
				presence helped to support your early friend in her great affliction." </p>
			<p>But it was not destined that these sad scenes should be the last in which Michael and
				his early friend were to be thrown together. In little more than a week after the
				death of Sir Matthew, and while Michael was still anxiously waiting at Fairly for
				such tidings from her as might put him at liberty to set off without further delay
				for Nice, a packet reached him from Dowling Lodge, containing two letters. One was
				from Martha, and contained these words:</p><quote>
			<p>"Dear Michael,</p>
			<p>"My brother tells me that all of us, who are old enough, must seek our own living,
				for that there is nothing left to support us. Myself especially, he says, must, to
				use his own words, look about me directly, as my behaviour to my family has never
				been such as to justify my looking to any of them for assistance. This amounts to my
				being actually turned out of doors, an exigency which at this moment leaves me no
				other resource than what is afforded by the enclosed letter. Read it, Michael, and
				let me know if you are willing to give me your assistance and protection in reaching
				the amiable writer of it. I could never have accepted, even for a day, the
				hospitality she so generously offer, could I not prove to her, by bringing you with
				me, that the sad subject which interrupted our friendship some seven or eight years
				ago, could never again be a source of pain to either of us.</p>
			<p>"My dear father's last act towards me, which was, as I think I told you, the placing
				a few hundred pounds in my hands for the express purpose of my leaving the country,
				will enable me to undertake this long journey without being a burden upon you, The
					<hi>green pocket-book</hi> , Michael, so well known to Mr. Parsons and Lady
				Clarissa, as the repository of my father's ready money, and so disgracefully
				struggled for during his last moments, will prove of no value to its possessors
				beyond its morocco cover and its silken lining; for the notes which he took from it
				to give to me, were the last he ever placed in it. My messenger has orders to wait
				for your reply. If it will suit you immediately to accompany me to Nice — my first
				stage shall be to the little inn at Fairly, which you mentioned to me. I fear you
				will find me a weak and troublesome traveller; but I think I have been improving in
				health ever since I learnt that I had not your death to answer for.</p>
			<p>"Your grateful friend, "Martha Dowling."</p></quote>
			<p>The other letter was from Miss Brotherton, and ran thus:</p>
			<quote><p> "Need I tell you, my dearest Martha, with what feelings I received the news of your
				present painful position? Your father's marriage with Lady Clarissa was, for your
				sake, a source of great sorrow to me, for I was certain that your domestic happiness
				would be destroyed by it; and this most unexpected event of your father's bankruptcy
				makes <pb n="372"/> me feel quite sure that you have no longer a comfortable home in
				England. Come then to me, my dear Martha! The painful estrangement which grew
				between us, just when I was beginning to know and value your excellent qualities,
				has long been a source of very painful regret to me, because I am aware that I
				judged you unfairly, and pronounced that judgment harshly. Be generous, then, and
				prove that you can forgive this, by immediately giving me the pleasure of receiving
				you as my guest. When we are together, we will consult about what will be best for
				the future; but at any rate I have the satisfaction of knowing that the climate to
				which I am inviting you is likely to be beneficial to your health during the
				approaching winter: come to me, then, dear friend, without delay. On the other side
				you will find the route sketched that I recommend you for your journey. My quarters
				are roomy enough to accommodate either man or maid-servant, or both, if it will suit
				you to be so accompanied. </p>
			<p>"Ever, my dear Martha, "Affectionately yours, " Mary
					Brotherton ."</p></quote>
			<p>The consequence of this packet was another metamorphosis on the part of Michael, "She
				shall not think," said he, addressing Mr. Bell, "that my respect for her is lessened
				because her fortune has fallen. I will wait upon her with faithful duty and most
				grateful affection: but she was born in a palace, and I in a cabin; and I will not,
				especially just now, obtrude myself upon her as a companion. As her servant I hope I
				may be useful to her, and it is in that capacity that I shall attend her."</p>
			<p> There was so much good feeling shown in this project, that Mr. Bell could not oppose
				it, whatever he might think of its necessity; and Michael, therefore, gave the
				astonished Martha the meeting at the little inn she had named, in the character of a
				very neat and respectable-looking man-servant. Her faithful Betty Parker, who had
				consented to be the companion of her journey, was in the room with her when Michael
				made his appearance at the door, to receive her orders. The cautious manner in which
				he made her comprehend his purpose, and the nature of the office he had assumed,
				suggested to her the propriety of not discussing it in the presence of the
				well-contented Betty, who was exceedingly comforted by discovering that the young
				man whom her mistress had informed her would travel with them, was to do so as her
				fellow-servant, as she by no means felt herself capable of becoming "servant of all
				work" to a young lady travelling through foreign countries, of which she had never
				even heard the names. But having contrived to dismiss her female attendant on an
				errand, Martha began to remonstrate with her faithful squire upon the great mistake
				he had made in fancying that she had ever thought of travelling with him in any
				other capacity than that of a friend. All she said, however, was in vain. Michael,
				though in a manner the most humbly respectful, persisted in his purpose; and the
				almost destitute girl was therefore constrained to set off upon her travels in a
				style which she <pb n="373"/> felt to be very unfitting to her situation. Her
				conscience, however, could not reproach her for this, for most assuredly she could
				not help it. </p>
			<p>Many were the letters, and various the mementos of affection, intrusted by Mr. and
				Mrs. Bell to the care of Michael for their dearly-beloved Mary Brotherton. Nor was
				there an individual of whose welfare he thought it would please her to hear, whom he
				did not visit to receive their loving blessings for the benefactress who,
				notwithstanding her wide wanderings, had never failed to remember the wants of all
				who had faithfully served her, or in any way become dependent on her bounty.</p>
			<p>These duties completed, and a farewell of most grateful affection uttered to the
				amiable clergyman and his excellent wife, Michael set off upon his long journey with
				feelings of hope, joy, confidence, fear, diffidence, and trembling affection, — all
				so strongly mixed together in his bosom that, had his life depended on it, he could
				not himself have told which it was that most frequently preponderated. Yet,
				altogether, his state of mind was very delightful: the novelty and excitement of
				journeying, so pregnant of enjoyment to most of us, was most especially captivating
				to him, whose education had been little more than the unchecked development of
				imagination, and of that keen observation of all surrounding objects which his
				shepherd life had taught him.</p>
			<p>The first painful interruption to the state of felicity, arose from his finding
				himself under the necessity of confessing to Martha that he had no more money
				wherewith to pay their way. Aware that in the performance of his self-appointed
				office Michael would have to pay every thing, and keep a regular account of it; and
				aware also that the money he had received from her would enable him to do this,
				without giving him the additional trouble of daily settlements with her, she had
				merely said, a minute or two before they set off, "You will be kind enough to be my
				banker, Michael, during the journey, and we will settle accounts at the end of
				it."</p>
			<p>For just one week from the day of their leaving Fairly, he was able to do this; but
				then the little remnant of his treasure failed him, and great as was his repugnance
				to the measure, he was compelled by dire necessity to confess that nearly the whole
				of her generous gift had gone to — "to satisfy the rapacity of Mr. Parsons."</p>
			<p>It would be hardly possible for one human being to be more grateful to another than
				poor Martha felt to her young attendant after this disclosure. She remembered the
				agony which he had made to cease; she remembered, too, her state of utter incapacity
				even to comprehend, and still less to avert the horrors that surrounded her; and,
				spite of all Michael's respectful efforts to induce her to perform her allotted
				character properly, she never from the hour of this disclosure treated him otherwise
				than as a dear and valued friend.</p>
			<p> As their journey approached its termination, however (to which period Michael had
				looked with peculiar anxiety, as that most important to the dignity of Martha),
				there was one argument, and one only, by which he was able to coax her into letting
				him make his first appearance before Miss Brotherton in the character of her
				servant; <pb n="374"/> and this was his very natural wish to ascertain whether
				Edward and Fanny would recognise him. </p>
			<p>It was therefore still in the dress, and with the demeanour of a servant, that the
				poor factory-boy, now become a tall and very handsome young man, armed himself with
				courage to enter the presence of his brother, and once more to draw near to the dear
				and gentle little being whom he had so fondly loved during the miserable period they
				had passed together at the Deep Valley. It had been previously agreed between
				himself and Martha, that when she sent for him, it should be for the purpose of
				giving him some long and particular instructions respecting the luggage he was to
				get from the custom-house, in order to give him time to look, and be looked at,
				before the moment of discovery should arrive.</p>
			<p>The young man trembled like an aspen-leaf as he laid his hand upon the lock of the
				door, the opening of which would bring him face to face with his brother. And
				perchance he might have indulged in a longer interval of preparation, had not the
				voice of Martha distinctly pronounced the words "Come in!" Further delay was out of
				the question; he pushed forward the door, and entered.</p>
			<p>The first figure that his eyes fell upon was that of a young lady — small, and of
				very delicate proportions — whose head, which was hanging over some employment as
				the door opened, was raised as he entered, displaying to him a very lovely face, and
				a pair of eyes whose dark brilliance almost made the beholder wink. Could that be
				Fanny Fletcher? No. Yet that it should be Miss Brotherton seemed more impossible
				still. Like all young people who have been separated from some one considerably
				older than themselves, ever since the period when this difference made one of them
				appear fully grown, while the other was still a child, Michael fancied that in Miss
				Brotherton he should see an elderly person, no more like a pretty girl, than he was
				himself. But Mary Brotherton had not fully completed her twenty-ninth year; and
				happening, moreover, to be very peculiarly young-looking both in face and figure, it
				was not very wonderful that he should doubt of her identity; for it was in truth
				Mary Brotherton, and no other, whose bright and laughing loveliness made him turn
				his admiring eyes away, in search of something dearer, though not more
				beautiful.</p>
			<p> At the end of the sofa-table, at which Miss Brotherton sat with Martha Dowling
				beside her, was a young female figure which presented only a profile to his gaze —
				But that was enough — the delicate oval face, the sweet regular small features, the
				glossy light brown hair parted Madonna-like upon the ivory brow, and the long
				eyelash that seemed to rest upon her cheek as she read, all proclaimed that he
				looked upon the same gentle lovely creature whose soft voice had whispered
				"patience!" when his spirit, but for her, had died within him. At the sight of this
				sweet vision, that in shadowy and uncertain outline had so often visited his
				reveries, Michael's manhood almost forsook him, and large tears gathered in his
				eyes, which he was fain to hide by turning round again and performing some
				blundering <pb n="375"/> operation with the lock of the door. Martha played her part
				admirably, appearing to be the most exceedingly particular young lady, about boxes,
				bags, and desks, that ever travelled. </p>
			<p>"Remember, I beg," she said, "that you see yourself to the opening of every package.
				Don't let them touch a single article that you do not watch the whole time; and be
				sure that every thing is locked again — and on no account forget the covers, or
				mismatch them — and remember particularly — " <hi>et cætera, et cætera</hi> , and so
				she ran on at the imminent risk of being classed by her clever friend Mary as the
				veriest fidget that ever arrived to bore a peaceable household and all in order to
				give her poor companion time to recover himself, and see distinctly what was before
				him.</p>
			<p>But Michael could not recover himself, nor could he even find courage to look about
				him. It was a large saloon that Miss Brotherton occupied, and the agitated young man
				rather felt that there was a gentleman occupied with books and papers at a distant
				table, than saw him. Yet to see him he was determined, if his life were to be the
				forfeit; and turning his head with an eye as troubled as that of Hamlet, when
				tremblingly following his father's spirit, he stood at last with clasped hands,
				protruded head, and features almost convulsed with emotion, when he had an
				uninterrupted view of his brother's clam and beautiful countenance.</p>
			<p>Edward was very busily employed, and unconsciously submitted himself to this
				examination without raising his eyes, or moving in any way; but Miss Brotherton's
				ear caught something like a sob from the silent object of all Martha's eloquence,
				and suddenly looking up perceived Michael in the attitude described, but stealthily,
				and perhaps unknowingly approaching Edward's table, while the tears he could no
				longer check, rolled down his manly cheek.</p>
			<p>There are some individuals of the human family gifted with such quickness of
				perception, and rapidity of inference, that their faculties act with the certainty
				of instinct, and the brilliancy of inspiration. Miss Brotherton was one of those;
				and after looking for a minute or two at Michael, quite as earnestly as Michael
				looked at Edward, she sprung from the sofa, pushed the table that stood before it
				with such violence from her as nearly to overset it, and rushing forward laid her
				hand upon his arm, exclaiming, "For mercy's sake tell me young man, who you are, and
				where you come from?"</p>
			<p>On hearing these words in a voice unusually loud and agitated, Edward rose hastily
				from his seat, and approached Miss Brotherton as if to protect her from some
				threatened danger; but turning towards him, she held up her hand as if to prevent
				his hostile approach, and said, "Stay Edward, stay! Look at him! Good Heaven! Look
				at him, dearest Edward, and tell me who he is like!"</p>
			<p> Thus addressed, Edward did look at his brother, and for a moment with a countenance
				that seemed to say Miss Brotherton had lost her wits — but suddenly Michael smiled
				at him as he caught his puzzled eye, and then he started, and almost gasped for
				breath — and his <pb n="376"/> distracted eyes fixed themselves on the agitated face
				before him as if they would read in it the history of years. </p>
			<p>"Edward! — Teddy!" cried Michael, opening his arms, and making a step in advance.</p>
			<p>In the next instant the brothers were locked in each other's arms, and Miss
				Brotherton drew back, and gazed upon them from a distance as if the very ground that
				sustained hearts under the influence of such feelings was holy — while Fanny
				Fletcher, rose and sat down, and rose again, checking the feeling that would have
				sent her to stretch forth a hand of welcome to her old friend, by telling herself
				that no hand, no voice but Edward's could be cared for then. And perhaps she was
				right; for it is certain that for several minutes, neither Edward nor Michael were
				fully conscious where they were, nor who they might be that were near them. Once and
				again each beating heart was strained against the brother heart, and then, their
				right hands clasped, and the left placed, each on the other's shoulder, "They fell
				to such perusal of the face," that now, after eight cruel years of absence, was once
				more beaming with love and sympathy before their eyes, that it must have been a very
				heartless and soulless being who should have come between them.</p>
			<p>Though such a history as Michael's might well have occupied more than one long
				summer's day in the telling, to ears so greedy of every circumstance connected with
				it as were those of Edward, yet it is wonderful how very short a time sufficed to
				point out the keystone of the arch, upon which the whole wonderful fabric hung, and
				then it was that Fanny Fletcher's voice was heard exclaiming in a burst of
				uncontrollable emotion,</p>
			<p>"Then it was I that caused it all! Oh! Miss Brotherton, it was I who kept him in that
				horrid place for years! Had I not told you he was dead, it would have been he who
				would have been the happy object of your bounty, instead of me! Oh! how can he ever
				forgive me?"</p>
			<p>This was uttered with such agitated rapidity, that though there was more than one
				present, who would have been ready enough to contradict the self-accusing statement,
				she gave them no time for it. But it sufficed to draw Michael from the side of his
				brother, and to place him at hers; and though this terrible thought drew a shower of
				tears from Fanny's eyes, notwithstanding the exceeding happiness which was at the
				very same moment throbbing at her heart; it may be that there could not have been
				found a more effectual mode of at once bringing back the long-parted friends to the
				same tone of familiar intercourse in which they had parted, as this sincere
				self-recrimination on one part, and the warm pleading against its injustice, on the
				other. For some minutes this lasted without being interrupted by a word from any
				one; for both Mary and Edward found, sufficient occupation in looking at them both,
				and then exchanging expressive glances of thanksgiving and happiness with each
				other. But at length, upon Fanny's saying with a fresh burst of tears,</p>
			<pb n="377"/>
			<p>"Oh, Michael! Michael! your eloquence is all in vain. You will never, never teach me
				to forget that I have been enjoying the blessed destiny intended for you, and that
				by means of words uttered by myself."</p>
			<p>Upon her saying this, the happy Mary Brotherton pushed a low tabouret before the
				reunited friends, and seating herself upon it, took Fanny's hand in hers, and said,
				"If you would not cry about it, my Fanny, I should think it was a mighty pretty
				exhibition of true feeling and false argument that we were witnessing; but if you
				really intend to be unhappy, we shall all range ourselves immediately on Michael's
				side, and laugh you to scorn for your sophistry, and the deplorable confusion you
				are making between cause and effect. I should like to know, little lady, how much it
				would have profited our Michael had you refused to answer when I inquired at the
				Deep Valley factory, if you knew aught about him? had you, while firmly believing he
				was dead, declined to state your belief, lest you might be mistaken, what would it
				have availed him, darling? Could he have crept down before us from his sick bed to
				settle the question? No, dear casuist you know better. Your looks are much more wise
				than your words, Fanny; for even now, though you pretend to shake your head, your
				truth-telling eyes confess that you have not another syllable to say."</p>
			<p>"But is it not singular," said Martha, who had been contemplating the scene with
				unspeakable delight, "is it not singular that Michael should twice have been the
				victim of words, uttered by such very friendly lips?"</p>
			<p>"Singular, dear Martha?" replied Mary; "is not every event connected with a hero of
				romance, of necessity and by immutable prescription, singular? And whom did Fate and
				Fortune ever fix upon more unmistakably to fill that distinguished position in
				society, than Michael Armstrong? Why are we all here together? Wholly and solely
				because Michael Armstrong saved Lady Clarissa Shrimpton from the terrors inspired by
				a cow — is it not so, dear friends? Can any of you deny that all the exceeding
				happiness that blesses us at this moment, has arisen from that most marvellously
				silly adventure? And shall we any of us quarrel at the steps (though some of them it
				must be confessed were rough enough), which have led from that nousensical
				beginning, to an end that has made us all so very happy? Yes! Michael Armstrong is a
				hero; he is our hero; he is the crowning blessing that is come to make us all thank
				Heaven for having brought us every one from greater and less degrees of misery, to
				very perfect pahpiness, and shall we not welcome him with smiles, instead of tears,
				Fanny?"</p>
			<p>Nothing could have been more admirably suited to the effect which the happy heiress
				meant to produce, than these words. How, after this, could Michael shrink, as he had
				expected to do, from the humiliating comparison between Edward and Fanny, with
				himself? Or how could Fanny persist in weeping, when her own heart, as well as those
				of all around her, was so cheeringly called upon to rejoice? Nothing of the sort was
				any longer thought of by either.</p>
			<pb n="378"/>
			<p>Without very well knowing how it came about, Michael, of all the multitude of
				contending feelings which had been lately so cruelly assailing him, being as they
				were, of that most harassing race begotten between fear and hope, was now conscious
				of only one, and that one was happiness unmixed. His frank and generous nature could
				no longer harbour any doubts as to the place he held in the affections of those whom
				he had lately thought of, as almost too high and too happy to remember him. He was
				with them, he was of them. If a thought of the future glanced athwart the delicious
				present, it came accompanied by a buoyant consciousness that there was that within
				him which would enable him to redeem lost time, and that whatever those he loved
				wished him to be, THAT he should have power to become.</p>
			<p>Nor was an answering confidence wanting in those who wearied not of gazing at his
				bright, expressive features, and his noble form. Fanny thought that he was exactly
				every thing she would have dreamed he must be, had she ventured to dream that he
				existed at all. Marry thought that she read capacity which promised power to become
				all that Edward could wish him to be — and she was not disposed to wish for more —
				and Edward himself thought and felt that had he power to choose a brother from among
				all the nations of the earth, and the noblest of them, Michael would have been the
				one he would have selected.</p>
			<p>"And where is my dear, good Tremlett?" said Miss Brotherton. "In the midst of all
				this rare felicity she must not be left out. She has shared our mourning for your
				loss, dear Michael, and shame it were she should not share our joy at finding
				you."</p>
			<p>"Shall I go and call her hither?" cried Fanny, rising."</p>
			<p>"No! that you shall not, Fanny," replied Miss Brotherton. "I will not trust you. It
				was I who dragged the dear good soul from post to pillar, in order to find you,
				Michael. — It was I who never let her know rest, night nor day, because you were
				not, and who but I shall bring her the glad tidings of your restoration?"</p>
			<p>But truly delighted as was Mary Brothrton at the idea of the pleasure which she well
				knew this unlooked-for arrival would cause her old friend, she would not let her
				taste it without the addition of a little mystification; and accordingly she led her
				into the room which contained the happy party, with no other preparation than
				telling her that there was a young Englishman in the saloon, to whom she must come
				and be introduced, because he was a countryman.</p>
			<p>To this the tractable old lady agreed, without testifying any very lively emotion;
				but when she had got into the midst of the group, and witnessed the general
				exaltation of spirits which seemed to possess them all, after looking and listening
				for a little while she could not help whispering to Fanny, "Do you know, my dear,
				who that young man is? I never saw Miss Brotherton — no! nor Mr. Armstrong either —
				seem to be so extraordinarily intimate with any one before, just at first
				sight."</p>
			<p>In reply to this Fanny only hid her face, and laughed, for she dared not trust her
				voice to give the information required.</p>
			<pb n="379"/>
			<p>"How very odd," murmured the old lady, drawing her knitting from her bag.</p>
			<p>"It is very odd, Mrs. Tremlett, very odd indeed," said Mary, "there is no denying it.
				But the fact is, that Mr. Armstrong has taken such an extraordinary fancy to this
				young man, that I really think I shall be obliged to ask him to live with us. There
				will be plenty of room, you know, in my Rhenish castle."</p>
			<p>The old lady said not a word in reply, but she looked puzzled, and vexed, and shook
				her head, as much as to say that it was not like her young mistress to talk such
				nonsense as that. So in her own defence Mary was obliged to explain the mystery, and
				as happy an old woman was nurse Tremlett, as she looked and listened, as ever tasted
				joy from the contemplation of it in others.</p>

			<head> CHAPTER XXXIII. </head>
			<p>A TÊTE'-À-TÊTE — A SECOND — A THIRD — A MYSTERIOUS RESULT — CONCLUSION.</p>
			<p>
				Delightful as was this state of mind to all that shared it, it
				could not last. Michael was too much in earnest in his dread of being a burden upon
				Miss Brotherton to permit many days to pass before he begged her to let him converse
				with her for a few moments in private; and Mary, who had already seen quite enough
				to convince her that the affection which Michael and Fanny had conceived for each
				other, amidst the dreary misery of the Deep Valley Mill, was not likely to be
				forgotten in the gay happiness of Nice, fully anticipated an humble confession, on
				the part of Michael, that he could not be happy without her permission to become the
				acknowledge lover of her charming friend and protégée, and very amiable, frank, and
				noble-minded, did she consider it in him, thus openly to avow the truth at once. But
				nothing could be further from the thoughts of Michael than making any such
				confession as this; which, it may be observed, is by no means saying that his heart
				was either innocent or unconscious of the presumptuous passion she attributed to
				it.</p>
			<p>Greatly, however, did Miss Brotherton underrate the young man's character when she
				conceived that the gracious favour with which she had received him, could generate
				in his heart a wish to ask for more.</p>
			<p>"It is taking a great liberty, madam," began Michael.</p>
			<p> "If you love me, do not call me madam, my dear Michael," she replied. "Do you not
				perceive that Edward and Fanny both call me <pb n="380"/> Mary? and till I had
				taught them to do so I never could feel that they quite understood the true spirit
				of my attachment towards them, or the mode and manner of existence which I have
				imagined for myself, and which must have fallen to the ground, if I had found them
				incapable of being to me, or letting me be to them, all that I wished and desired.
				You must not, dearest Michael, come and shake this perfect and delightful union,
				introducing forms and ceremonies foreign to our manners, and our feelings. Pray do
				not look so grave, dear friend! Promise to offend thus no more, and I will cease to
				scold you." </p>
			<p>"Dearest Miss Brotherton!" said Michael. But this did not satisfy the
					<hi>exigeante</hi> lady, who shook her head, and held up her finger in reproof.
				"Dearest Mary! then — " he resumed, colouring brightly, and with a smile that made
				her think she could trace a family likeness to Edward, "the greatest wish I have on
				earth is to become such as you might approve, and if I shrink from the dear and
				precious familiarity which must make Edward and Fanny so happy, think not that I am
				incapable of loving you as perfectly as they do; but remember, dearest lady! that
				however humble their origin, the very circumstance of their having been your
				honoured companions for years, is of itself sufficient to raise them to such a tone
				of thinking and of manners, as may, in some sort, justify their using the privilege
				you so graciously afford. But, alas! You must know too well that the case is far
				different with me. The overflowing joy of our first meeting, naturally broke down,
				as it were, all inequalities, all boundaries, and I certainly felt, and perhaps
				spoke, as if I too were one of the accomplished little circle that might call this
				earthly paradise their home. But reflection will come, most generous Mary! if not
				amidst the happy intoxicating moments of the day, it will make itself a voice in the
				quiet reasoning meditations of the night, and so loudly has this voice been heard by
				me, that I cannot — no, in spite of all the happiness that surrounds me, I cannot
				live on thus, an idle, ignorant dependant on your bounty."</p>
			<p> The heiress was half vexed, but more than half pleased by this trembling address,
				the deep sincerity of which was testified by the working features of a countenance
				more than commonly expressive of all that passed within. She had enjoyed so much
				genuine happiness since that arrival of Michael, and had watched with pleasure so
				exquisite the happiness of Edward and Fanny, that she almost trembled at the idea of
				any change; yet she knew the boy was right; she knew that he ought to apply himself
				immediately and strenuously to such studies as were most necessary for the redeeming
				the time he had lost, and so well aware was she of this, that, notwithstanding her
				unwillingness to part with him, she rejoiced heartily to find that she was wrong as
				to the subject on which she had suspected he wished to speak. Had she been right in
				her conjecture, all she could have done would have been to endow the boy and girl
				with such a portion of her wealth as might have sufficed to make them independent;
				but under such <pb n="381"/> circumstances, all notion of essential improvement must
				of course be abandoned for ever, and for many reasons this would have been a source
				of lasting regret to her. It was therefore with cordial approbation that after the
				interval of a few moments, she replied, "Michael, you are right. Nature has done so
				much for you, my dear friend, that our wish to keep you constantly with us might
				easily, had you shown less courage, have tempted us to fancy that you wanted nothing
				which you have not got, or which we could not give you. But you are quite right in
				refusing to consent to this. We will immediately return to Germany where you shall
				be placed at the same admirable institution that so rapidly made your brother what
				you now see him. Two yeas of well-directed devotion to study, my dear Michael, will
				perhaps make you feel more at your ease among us, though I doubt, if it can produce
				any change which will make us love you better. </p>
			<p>"Miss Brotherton! dearest Miss Brotherton!" exclaimed Michael — while perhaps the
				brightest beam of hope that ever yet shot from his eyes, met hers as she
				affectionately gazed upon him, "that was not what I — what I dared venture to hope
				and ask for. What you now propose, would be a happiness, the idea of which I think I
				should have turned from, even in my dreams, from shame at its towering ambition. All
				I meant to ask was, your kind aid to place me in some business where I might earn a
				maintenance, that in a year or two might prevent my being a burden to you — and now
				— "</p>
			<p>"And now, Michael, I tell you fairly, that I have not the slightest intention of
				doing any such thing. Besides my own particular objection to such a mode of
				proceeding, I have lately heard a little anecdote of you, from your friend Martha,
				which makes it very doubtful whether you deserve that species of independence — for
				she put it in your possession once, you know — and you could not keep it. I shall
				manage better, Michael, depend upon it. One week more of idleness in this sweet spot
				— and then we travel back to Germany. You shall not be left to study in a more
				forsaken condition than was your brother. We shall be within an easy distance of
				you, my dear Michael. One corner of my castle must hold us, while another is
				beautified, and it is likely enough the work will go on all the better for our being
				there."</p>
			<p>"And your visit to Rome given up for my sake?" cried Michael. "Oh! no, no, no!"</p>
			<p>"No, no, no, most certainly," replied Mary, laughing, "I would not give up that
				journey, Michael, for more than I will say, "All is not lost that is delayed."
				Instead of giving up the plan, I only mean to improve it. Tell me, and tell me
				honestly, dear Michael, do you not think in your heart that we shall, one and all,
				enjoy this journey more if you are with us?"</p>
			<p> "Mary!" exclaimed the boy, wholly overcome, and seizing and kissing her hand with an
				emotion that at once and for ever banished all reserve, "Mary! it is your will to be
				loved, and who can disobey? <pb n="382"/> But my happiness seems greater than I can
				bear! Where is Edward? Let me walk, and talk with him! He is used to you, Mary, and
				all this may not seem to him so very much like a dream as it does to me. If he tells
				me it is all real, I shall believe it;" and with these words, and his fine face
				glowing with all the best and happiest feelings of our nature, Michael bounded from
				the presence of his benefactress to seek his brother. </p>
			<p>"I might have lived a good while in my fine house, at Milford, and received a
				prodigious number of complimentary visits from my elegant neighbours, before I
				should have enjoyed half an hour as I have done this," thought the happy Mary
				Brotherton, as she strolled out through an open window, that led to a little garden
				of orange-trees. "How delicious is the air this morning!" But where was the climate,
				where, at that moment, she would have felt it to be otherwise?</p>
			<p>Michael had no difficulty in finding his brother, who in truth was lingering near, on
				purpose to question him after this interview.</p>
			<p>"Come with me, Edward!" cried the agitated boy, seizing his arm; "here are our hats —
				come with me into that little grove yonder — my heart will burst if I do not
				instantly tell you what has passed." And arm-in-arm they crossed the road, and a
				small enclosure opposite, and there found themselves under the shelter of a little
				wood, thick enough to exclude the peering eyes of mortals, as well as that of the
				sun.</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding their eagerness for the communication which was to follow, and which
				was pretty equally strong in both, not a word was uttered by either till they
				reached this covert, and then, Michael, throwing himself upon a bank, and casting
				his hat away, clasped his hands, and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, "Edward,
				she is an angel!"</p>
			<p>Edward had not followed his brother's example, in lying down, but stood before him in
				act to listen. But there was something in these words that seemed to shake him, for
				he turned away without answering.</p>
			<p>"Has she ever named to you her plans about me?" resumed Michael.</p>
			<p>"Yes!" replied Edward.</p>
			<p>"Then you know that it is not her intention to assist me, by enabling me to learn any
				trade in handicraft?"</p>
			<p>"No such idea, Michael, ever entered her head," said Edward, gravely.</p>
			<p>"But, my dear fellow! you seem to take all this so very coolly. Do you know that it
				is her intention to send me to the same place where your education was completed? —
				Do you know that she gives up — no — that she postpones her journey to Italy, till I
				am ready to go with her? — Edward, do you know all this?"</p>
			<p> "My dear brother," replied Edward, "I only know, that from the moment she learnt you
				were alive, she determined that she would immediately make you perfectly
				independent, as she has done me. All the rest, I think, depended upon your own
				inclination — and had she <pb n="383"/> not found you disposed for this scheme, she
				would not have insisted upon it." </p>
			<p>"Disposed for it, Edward? Oh! what cold, what chilling words! You could not speak so,
				if you thought there were any hope of my so profiting by it as to become a fit
				companion for you — for her — for Fanny. But it is too late — you feel that it is
				too late — is it not so, Edward?"</p>
			<p>"No, Michael, no!" returned Edward, with sudden animation. "With your faculties, your
				eager desire to learn, and the masters you will have to put you in the way of doing
				so, I KNOW hat the result of these two years of study will be all you wish, and all
				your friends can desire."</p>
			<p>"Then how can you receive this glorious news, my Edward, so composedly?"</p>
			<p>"First, dear Michael, because it is no news to me. And secondly, because I am a
				selfish wretch, and was thinking, perhaps, more of my own interest than of yours.
				Forgive me for it, my own dear Michael! But I would rather have had it decided that
				we should have both marched off, and taken service under the Emperor of Austria. I
				know that commissions would have been obtained for us."</p>
			<p>Michael, as his brother uttered these words, looked up into his face with an
				expression of such astonishment and dismay, that the blood rushed to Edward's face,
				and he turned away to conceal his confusion.</p>
			<p>"Edward! you are a mystery to me," exclaimed Michael, springing upon his feet, and
				taking his brother by the arm. "Can it be possible that you are weary of the life
				you lead? Oh, heaven! and such a life!"</p>
			<p>"Weary? am I weary of it, Michael? weary of rising every day to feel that I am a
				wretch unworthy to breathe the breath of life any where? And oh! how utterly
				unworthy to breathe it here!"</p>
			<p>It was now poor Michael's turn to change colour, and he did so pretty violently — for
				first he became very red, and then exceedingly pale. That Edward, such as he had
				ever remembered him, such as he found him now, that he should so very solemnly
				declare himself to be a wretch unworthy of life, was a horror and a misery as
				terrible as it was unexpected. He had no power to utter any soothing in
				contradiction to this appalling statement, for, alas! it might be true — and
				Michael's heart sunk within him as he remembered how totally ignorant he was of
				every thing that might enable him to disbelieve it. Silently the brothers walked on
				for some paces, side by side. They were both of them either unwilling, or unable to
				speak. At length a sort of shuddering emotion that passed through Michael's frame,
				made itself felt by the arm of Edward, which he still held, and then he stopped, and
				without raising his eyes from the ground, said,</p>
			<p>"Michael! How is it you understand me? Do you suppose that I have been guilty of some
				criminal act, such as dooms man to the gallows? If not, why do you shudder
				thus?"</p>
			<pb n="384"/>
			<p>"Would you not shudder, Edward, if you heard me say, that I was a wretch unworthy to
				live?"</p>
			<p>"Poor Michael! perhaps I might; but still I doubt if I should understand the phrase
				as you do. It is so difficult, so impossible to express temperately and soberly, my
				own reprobation of the feelings that destroy me! And yet, dear Michael," he
				continued more tranquilly, "I could have fancied that there was something working in
				your own heart which might have taught you in some degree to guess the state of mine
				— I have no strength, no courage to enter on the guilty subject fully — but — that
				you may not think me a felon, Michael, I will tell you in one audacious word, I
				LOVE, and that with a fervour, a vehemence of passion, that often makes me tremble
				at myself — for did it ever master me so far as to force a confession of it in the
				presence of its object, I never could look up again, but must and would for ever
				become an alien from all I love, and a friendless wanderer on the face of the
				earth."</p>
			<p>Though shocked more deeply than he had any wish or power to express, Michael could
				not resist the belief, which came with terrible strength upon him, that his unhappy
				brother had conceived a passion for some married woman, and that his best chance of
				recovering both his virtue and his tranquillity would be by following the wish he
				had expressed, and by entering on a new and active career, to give himself a chance
				of obliterating from his mind the feelings which had so unhappily taken possession
				of it. Such a destination for Edward must of course destroy some the very brightest
				of his own beautiful day-dreams: but there was a fund of integrity and real goodness
				in the heart of Michael that permitted him not at that moment to think of himself.
				"Edward!" said he solemnly, "if this be so, follow the course that your better
				feelings have suggested — adopt at once the profession of a soldier. It has ever
				been accounted a noble one — though, under happier circumstances — but that matters
				not — if your passions have led you wrong, let your principles bring you back again.
				Confess the truth to your generous benefactress at once."</p>
			<p>"Michael!" replied Edward, looking in his face with an expression of suffering that
				almost amounted to agony — "I would rather die first." These words seemed intended
				to close the conversation, or at any rate they did so; for the two brothers silently
				retraced their path to the house, and a fond pressure, expressive of love and pity,
				which Michael gave to the arm of Edward before he parted from it, was all that
				passed between them further at that time.</p>
			<p> The interview of that morning with Miss Brotherton had awakened in the mind of
				Michael, feelings towards her which an hour before he would have thought it must
				have taken years to produce; but being equally sincere, both in his former timidity
				and his present confidence, he speedily made up his mind to open his heart to her,
				and do for his guilty, but suffering brother, what it was evident he had not courage
				to do for himself. In pursuance of this resolution, he again sought the heiress, and
				whispered in her ear, "Mary! — will you let me talk to you a little more?" She
				eagerly complied with the implied invitation, <pb n="385"/> and passing her arm
				through his, accompanied him to the scene of their former <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> . </p>
			<p>There was no shyness on the part of Michael. The familiar appellation he had used was
				not assumed for the purpose of proving his obedience, but resulted from a genuine
				feeling of affectionate confidence in every word she had uttered, and which had left
				on his mind the belief that she was not only his generous patroness, but his loving
				friend.</p>
			<p>"I little thought when I was talking to you this morning about my poor self," he
				said, "that I should so soon have to take you away again from your drawing, to talk
				about Edward."</p>
			<p>"About Edward?" said Mary colouring, "what do you wish to say about him, dear
				Michael?"</p>
			<p>"It is something that he declares he would die rather than say to you himself,"
				replied Michael, "but I am certain that you ought to know it, for it is quite clear
				that there is no chance of happiness for him unless you agree to his wishes."</p>
			<p>"What wishes?" exclaimed the heiress, terribly agitated, "for goodness sake, Michael,
				do not trifle with me! Did Edward commission you to speak to me?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, no! had he felt courage to do <hi>that</hi> , I should have told him at once,
				that he had better do it himself," replied Michael. "Indeed I fear greatly that he
				will be displeased with me; but I cannot bear to see him so miserable without
				mentioning it to the only person capable of helping him."</p>
			<p>"Miserable? — Helping him? — Tell me, Michael, tell me at once what you mean!"</p>
			<p>"That is exactly what I wish to do, dear Mary!" replied Michael, looking with
				considerable surprise at her varying colour, and agitated features; "but I fear I am
				doing wrong, and that I have already said something that vexes you."</p>
			<p>"No, no!" cried Mary impatiently, "only, go on!"</p>
			<p>"In one word, then," resumed Michael, "our dear Edward wishes beyond all things to
				enter the Austrian service."</p>
			<p>"And leave us!" returned the heiress, almost gasping. "Does Edward want to leave
				me?"</p>
			<p>"Do not suspect him of ingratitude, Mary!" cried Michael, eagerly; "there is a reason
				for it, and without this I am quite sure he would never think of such a thing. —
				Edward has conceived an unfortunate passion for an object from whom he ought to fly
				— and this, of course, will explain every thing to you."</p>
			<p>"Let me see him! Let me hear him! From himself, and from himself only I can hear
				this. Let it mean what it may." On uttering these words, which were spoken with a
				very agitated and untranquil air, Mary Brotherton rushed out of the room, much to
				Michael's astonishment; for he could by no means comprehend <hi>why</hi> she should
				testify such very strong emotion, especially as he had so cautiously and delicately
				avoided hinting any thing about a married woman's being unhappily the object of his
				brother's passion.</p>
			<pb n="386"/>
			<p>In this ignorance of Michael's, the reader, I am very sorry to say, must share. There
				are some fact which no wise historian will ever venture to dilate upon, lest their
				strangeness should provoke incredulity; and great wisdom is shown by such
				forbearance; for it is infinitely better that an elightened public should be driven
				to exclaim, " <hi>How very obscure this passage is!</hi> " than " <hi>How very
					improbable!</hi> "</p>
			<p>Michael Armstrong is the hero of the book that is now drawing rapidly to its
				conclusion; and every reader has therefore a right to expect that his destiny shall
				be plainly announced to them, whatever mystery may hang over that of others.
				Whatever occurred between the heiress and Edward in the conference which they
				speedily held together, it did not cause any alteration in that lady's purpose of
				immediately returning to her chateau upon the Rhine. A man of worth and great
				ability was engaged to take charge of the richly teeming eager mind of Michael,
				during the two years that it was settled he should remain at a German university,
				and nothing could be more satisfactory than the result of this arrangement. Never,
				perhaps, were two years put to greater profit in the development of mind, than upon
				this occasion; and when they were ended, Michael Armstrong was able to take his
				station upon the beautiful terrace, without feeling that he was out of his place
				there.</p>
			<p> Less than these two years had sufficed to bring to perfection all Mary Brotherton's
				plans for improving and beautifying her spacious residence. It was one of those
				super-terranean quarries which are sometimes seen to spread themselves to such
				miraculous extent in that region, and would have inspired most ladies with a feeling
				of dreary vastness, which, notwithstanding the exceeding beauty of its position,
				would have prevented any hope of rendering it comfortably habitable. But Mary had an
				ample heart, and an ample purse. Circumstances over which (to use a thoroughly
				authorized expression) she had no control, for in truth they had preceded her birth,
				had rendered her own country less dear to her than it is to most others; and she
				therefore not only determined to plant herself elsewhere, but to do so in such a
				manner as would enable her to make her new abode her home, in the best sense of the
				word, and this could only be done by giving. "Ample room, and verge enough," to make
				it the home of others also. Any travellers lucky enough to light upon this
				widely-spreading, but comfortable and thoroughly well kept-up abode, will find that,
				notwithstanding its great extent, it has, by no means, the air of being uninhabited.
				Nobody will be much surprised to hear that Michael Armstrong and Fanny Fletcher
				became man and wife, or that they proved a loving and very happy pair; but, should
				any curious Rhenish tourist obtain an introduction to this Rhingau paradise, they
				will probably observe two very loving and happy pairs, to whom it serves as a common
				yet, in some sort, a separate home, each having its suite of drawing-rooms,
				boudoirs, nurseries, school-rooms, <hi>elcætera</hi> . But however much a gossiping
				inclination <pb n="387"/> might lead to a more explicit detail, there is really no
				room left to enter upon it. All that can be said in addition to this is, that when
				Sir Matthew Dowling's affairs came to be wound up, there was discovered to be a
				sufficient surplus to afford a small independence to each of his children, which,
				being divided according to the proportion dictated by the knight's will, gave
				something approaching to a Benjamin's mess portion to his daughter Martha. To claim
				and receive this, as well as occasionally to visit some members of her family,
				Martha made frequent excursions to England: but her happiest hours were those she
				passed with her dear friends in Germany, by whom she is ever received with open
				arms. </p>
			<p>Mrs. Tremlett is still enjoying an old age of perfect comfort, cheered by warm
				affection, and is already the darling of many little hearts.</p>
			<p>There is no record to be found in any documents relating to the inhabitants of the
				chateau, showing that Edward Armstrong ever entered the Austrian service. It is,
				therefore, most reasonable to suppose that this wish was never complied with.</p>
