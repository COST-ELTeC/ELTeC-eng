    <p>Why should I not publish my diary? I have often seen reminiscences of people I have never
     even heard of, and I fail to see—because I do not happen to be a 'Somebody'—why my diary should
     not be interesting. My only regret is that I did not commence it when I was a youth. </p>

    <p>We settle down in our new home, and I resolve to keep a diary. Tradesmen trouble us a bit, so
     does the scraper. The Curate calls and pays me a great compliment.</p>
    <p><label>My</label> dear wife Carrie and I have just been a week in our new house, "The
     Laurels," Brickfield Terrace, Holloway—a nice six-roomed residence, not counting basement with
     a front breakfast-parlour. We have a little front garden; and there is a flight of ten steps up
     to the front door; which, by-the-by, we keep locked with the chain up. Cummings, Gowing, and
     our other intimate friends always come to the little side
     <pb n="14"/> entrance, which saves the servant the trouble of going up to the front door,
     thereby taking her from her work. We have a nice little back garden which runs down to the
     railway. We were rather afraid of the noise of the trains at first, but the landlord said we
     should not notice them after a bit, and took £2 off the rent. He was certainly right;
     <pb n="15"/> and beyond the cracking of the garden-wall at the bottom, we have suffered no
     inconvenience.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic14"/>


    <p>After my work in the City, I like to be at home. What's the good of a home, if you are never
     in it? "Home, Sweet Home," that's my motto. I am always in of an evening. Our old friend Gowing
     may drop in without ceremony; so may Cummings, who lives opposite. My dear wife Caroline and I
     are pleased to see them, if they like to drop in on us. But Carrie and I can manage to pass our
     evenings together without friends. There is always something to be done: a tin-tack here, a
     Venetian blind to put straight, a fan to nail up, or part of a carpet to nail down—all of which
     I can do with my pipe in my mouth; while Carrie is not above putting a button on a shirt,
     mending a pillow-case, or practising the "Sylvia Gavotte" on our new cottage piano (on the
     three years' system), manufactured by W. Bilkson (in small letters), from Collard and Collard
     (in very large letters). It is also a great comfort to us to know that our boy Willie is
     getting on so well in the Bank at Oldham. We should like to see more of him. Now for my
     diary:—</p>
    <p><label>April 3.</label>—Tradesmen called for custom, and I promised Farmerson, the
     ironmonger, to give him a
     <pb n="16"/> turn if I wanted any nails or tools. By-the-by, that reminds me there is no key to
     our bedroom door, and the bells must be seen to. The parlour bell is broken, and the front door
     rings up in the servant's bedroom, which is ridiculous. Dear friend Gowing dropped in, but
     wouldn't stay, saying there was an infernal smell of paint.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n=""/>


    <p><label>April 4.</label>—Tradesmen still calling: Carrie being out, I arranged to deal with
     Horwin, who seemed a civil butcher with a nice clean shop. Ordered a shoulder of mutton for
     to-morrow, to give him a trial. Carrie arranged with Dorset, the butterman, and ordered a pound
     of fresh butter, and a pound and a half of salt ditto for kitchen, and a shilling's worth of
     eggs. In the evening, Cummings unexpectedly dropped
     <pb n="17"/> in to show me a meerschaum pipe he had won in a raffle in the City, and told me to
     handle it carefully, as it would spoil the colouring if the hand was moist. He said he wouldn't
     stay, as he didn't care much for the smell of the paint, and fell over the scraper as he went
     out. Must get the scraper removed, or else I shall get into a <hi>scrape</hi>. I don't often
     make jokes.</p>
    <p><label>April 5.</label>—Two shoulders of mutton arrived, Carrie having arranged with another
     butcher without consulting me. Gowing called, and fell over scraper coming in. <hi>Must</hi>
     get that scraper removed.</p>
    <p><label>April 6.</label>—Eggs for breakfast simply shocking; sent them back to Borset with my
     compliments, and he needn't call any more for orders. Couldn't find umbrella, and though it was
     pouring with rain, had to go without it. Sarah said Mr. Gowing must have took it by mistake
     last night, as there was a stick in the 'all that didn't belong to nobody. In the evening,
     hearing someone talking in a loud voice to the servant in the downstairs hall, I went out to
     see who it was, and was surprised to find it was Borset, the butterman, who was both drunk and
     offensive. Borset, on seeing me, said he would be hanged if
     <pb n="18"/> he would ever serve City clerks any more—the game wasn't worth the candle. I
     restrained my feelings, and quietly remarked that I thought it was <hi>possible</hi> for a City
     clerk to be a <hi>gentleman</hi>. He replied he was very glad to hear it, and wanted to know
     whether
     <pb n="19"/> I had ever come across one, for <hi>he</hi> hadn't. He left the house, slamming
     the door after him, which nearly broke the fanlight; and I heard him fall over the scraper,
     which made me feel glad I hadn't removed it. When he had gone, I thought of a splendid answer I
     ought to have given him. However, I will keep it for another occasion.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic18"/>


    <p><label>April 7.</label>—Being Saturday, I looked forward to being home early, and putting a
     few things straight; but two of our principals at the office were absent through illness, and I
     did not get home till seven. Found Borset waiting. He had been three times during the day to
     apologise for his conduct last night. He said he was unable to take his Bank Holiday last
     Monday, and took it last night instead. He begged me to accept his apology, and a pound of
     fresh butter. He seems, after all, a decent sort of fellow; so I gave him an order for some
     fresh eggs, with a request that on this occasion they <hi>should</hi> be fresh. I am afraid we
     shall have to get some new stair-carpets after all; our old ones are not quite wide enough to
     meet the paint on either side. Carrie suggests that we might ourselves broaden the paint. I
     will see if we can match the colour (dark chocolate) on Monday.</p>
    <pb n="20"/>
    <p><label>April 8, Sunday.</label>—After Church, the Curate came back with us. I sent Carrie in
     to open front door, which we do not use except on special occasions. She could not get it open,
     and after all my display, I had to take the Curate (whose name, by-the-by, I did not catch)
     round the side entrance. He caught his foot in the scraper, and tore the bottom of his
     trousers. Most annoying, as Carrie could not well offer to repair them on a Sunday. After
     dinner, went to sleep. Took a walk round the garden, and discovered a beautiful spot for sowing
     mustard-and-cress and radishes. Went to Church again in the evening: walked back with the
     Curate. Carrie noticed he had got on the same pair of trousers, only repaired. He wants me to
     take round the plate, which I think a great compliment.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
    <p>Tradesmen and the scraper still troublesome. Gowing rather tiresome with his complaints of
     the paint. I make one of the best jokes of my life. Delights of gardening. Mr. Stillbrook,
     Gowing, Cummings, and I have a little misunder­standing. Sarah makes me look a fool before
     Cummings.</p>
    <p><label>April 9</label>—Commenced the morning badly. The butcher, whom we decided <hi>not</hi>
     to arrange with, called and blackguarded me in the most uncalled-for manner. He began by
     abusing me, and saying he did not want my custom. I simply said: "Then what are you making all
     this fuss about it for?" And he shouted out at the top of his voice, so that all the neighbours
     could hear: "Pah! go along. Ugh! I could buy up 'things' like you by the dozen!"</p>
    <p>I shut the door, and was giving Carrie to understand that this disgraceful scene was entirely
     her fault, when there was a violent kicking at the
     <pb n="24"/> door, enough to break the panels. It was the blackguard butcher again, who said he
     had cut his foot over the scraper, and would immediately bring an action against me. Called at
     Farmerson's, the ironmonger, on my way to town, and gave him the job of moving the scraper and
     repairing the bells, thinking it scarcely worth while to trouble the landlord with such a
     trifling matter.</p>
    <p>Arrived home tired and worried. Mr. Putley, a painter and decorator, who had sent in a card,
     said he could not match the colour on the stairs, as it contained Indian carmine. He said he
     spent half-a-day calling at warehouses to see if he could get it. He suggested he should
     entirely re-paint the stairs. It would cost very little more; and if he tried to match it, he
     could only make a bad job of it. It would be more satisfactory to him and to us to have the
     work done properly. I consented, but felt I had been talked over. Planted some
     mustard-and-cress and radishes, and went to bed at nine.</p>
    <p><label>April 10.</label>—Farmerson came round to attend to the scraper himself. He seems a
     very civil fellow. He says he does not usually conduct such small jobs personally, but for
      <hi>me</hi> he would do so. I thanked
     <pb n="25"/> him, and went to town. It is disgraceful how late some of the young clerks are at
     arriving. I told three of them that if Mr. Perkupp, the principal, heard of it, they might be
     discharged.</p>
    <p>Pitt, a monkey of seventeen, who has only been with us six weeks, told me "to keep my hair
     on!" I informed him I had had the honour of being in the firm twenty years, to which he
     insolently replied that I "looked it." I gave him an indignant look, and said: "I demand from
     you some respect, sir." He replied: "All right, go on demanding." I would not argue with him
     any further. You cannot argue with people like that. In the evening Gowing called, and repeated
     his complaint about the smell of paint. Gowing is sometimes very tedious with his remarks, and
     not always cautious; and Carrie once very properly reminded him that she was present.</p>
    <p><label>April 11.</label>—Mustard-and-cress and radishes not come up yet. To-day was a day of
     annoyances. I missed the quarter-to-nine 'bus to the City, through having words with the
     grocer's boy, who for the second time had the impertinence to bring his basket to the
     hall-door, and had left the marks of his dirty boots on the fresh-cleaned door-steps. He said
     he had knocked at the side-door with his
     <pb n="26"/> knuckles for a quarter of an hour. I knew Sarah, our servant, could not hear this,
     as she was upstairs doing the bedrooms, so asked the boy why he did not ring the bell? He
     replied that he <hi>did</hi> pull the bell, but the handle came off in his hand.</p>
    <p>I was half-an-hour late at the office, a thing that has never happened to me before. There
     has recently been much irregularity in the attendance of the clerks, and Mr. Perkupp, our
     principal, unfortunately chose this very morning to pounce down upon us early. Someone had
     given the tip to the others. The result was that I was the only one late of the lot. Buckling,
     one of the senior clerks, was a brick, and I was saved by his intervention. As I passed by
     Pitt's desk, I heard him remark to his neighbour: "How disgracefully late some of the head
     clerks arrive?" This was, of course, meant for me. I treated the observation with silence,
     simply giving him a look, which unfortunately had the effect of making both of the clerks
     laugh. Thought afterwards it would have been more dignified if I had pretended not to have
     heard him at all. Cummings called in the evening, and we played dominoes.</p>
    <p><label>April 12.</label>—Mustard-and-cress and radishes not come up yet. Left Farmerson
     repairing the scraper,
     <pb n="27"/> but when I came home found three men working. I asked the meaning of it, and
     Farmerson said that in making a fresh hole he had penetrated the gas-pipe. He said it was a
     most ridiculous place to put the gas-pipe, and the man who did it evidently knew nothing about
     his business. I felt his excuse was no consolation for the expense I shall be put to.</p>
    <p>In the evening, after tea, Gowing dropped in, and we had a smoke together in the
     breakfast-parlour. Carrie joined us later, but did not stay long, saying the smoke was too much
     for her. It was also rather too much for me; for Gowing had given me what he called a green
     cigar, one that his friend Shoemach had just brought over from America. The cigar didn't look
     green, but I fancy I must have done so; for when I had smoked a little more than half, I was
     obliged to retire on the pretext of telling Sarah to bring in the glasses.</p>
    <p>I took a walk round the garden three or four times, feeling the need of fresh air. On
     returning Gowing noticed I was not smoking: offered me another cigar, which I politely
     declined. Gowing began his usual sniffing, so, anticipating him, I said: "You're not going to
     complain of the smell of paint again?" He said: "No, not this time; but I'll tell you what, I
     distinctly smell dry
     <pb n="28"/> rot." I don't often make jokes, but I replied: "You're talking a lot of <hi>dry
      rot</hi> yourself." I could not help roaring at this, and Carrie said her sides quite ached
     with laughter. I never was so immensely tickled by anything I have ever said before. I actually
     woke up twice during the night, and laughed till the bed shook.</p>
    <p><label>April 13.</label>—An extraordinary coincidence: Carry had called in a woman to make
     some chintz covers for our drawing-room chairs and sofa to prevent the sun fading the green rep
     of the furniture. I saw the woman, and recognised her as a woman who used to work years ago for
     my old aunt at Clapham. It only shows how small the world is.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><label>April 14.</label>—Spent the whole of the afternoon in the garden, having this morning
     picked up at a bookstall for fivepence a capital little book, in good condition, on
      <hi>Gardening</hi>. I procured and sowed some half-hardy annuals in what I fancy will be a
     warm, sunny border. I thought of a joke, and called out Carrie. Carrie came out rather testy, I
     thought. I said: "I have just discovered we have got a lodging-house." She replied: "How do you
     mean?" I said: "Look at the <hi>boarders</hi>." Carrie said: "Is
     <pb n="29"/> that all you wanted me for?" I said: "Any other time you would have laughed at my
     little pleasantry." Carrie said: "Certainly-<hi>at any other time</hi>, but not when I am busy
     in the house." The stairs looked very nice. Gowing called, and said the stairs looked <hi>all
      right</hi>, but it made the banisters look <hi>all wrong</hi>, and suggested a coat of paint
     on them also, which Carrie quite agreed with. I walked round to Putley, and fortunately he was
     out; so I had a good excuse to let the banisters slide. By-the-by, that is rather funny.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic29"/>


    <p><label>April 15, Sunday.</label>—At three o'clock Cummings and Gowing called for a good long
     walk over Hampstead and Finchley, and brought with them a friend
     <pb n="30"/> named Stillbrook. We walked and chatted together, except Stillbrook, who was
     always a few yards behind us staring at the ground and cutting at the grass with his stick.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic30"/>


    <p>As it was getting on for five, we four held a consultation, and Gowing suggested that we
     should make for "The Cow and Hedge" and get some tea. Stillbrook said: "A brandy-and-soda was
     good enough for him." I reminded them that all public-houses were closed till six o'clock.
     Stillbrook said: "That's all right—<hi>bonâ fide</hi> travellers."</p>
    <p>We arrived; and as I was trying to pass,
     <pb n="32"/> the man in charge of the gate said: "Where from?" I replied: "Holloway." He
     immediately put up his arm, and declined to let me pass. I turned back for a moment, when I saw
     Stillbrook, closely followed by Cummings and Gowing, make for the entrance. I watched them, and
     thought I would have a good laugh at their expense. I heard the porter say: "Where from?" When,
     to my surprise, in fact disgust, Stillbrook replied: "Blackheath," and the three were
     immediately admitted.</p>
    <pb n="[31]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic31"/>


    <p>Gowing called to me across the gate, and said: "We shan't be a minute." I waited for them the
     best part of an hour. When they appeared they were all in most excellent spirits, and the only
     one who made an effort to apologise was Mr. Stillbrook, who said to me: "It was very rough on
     you to be kept waiting, but we had another spin for S. and B.'s." I walked home in silence; I
     couldn't speak to them. I felt very dull all the evening, but deemed it advisable <hi>not</hi>
     to say anything to Carrie about the matter.</p>
    <p><label>April 16.</label>—After business, set to work in the garden. When it got dark I wrote
     to Cummings and Gowing (who neither called, for a wonder; perhaps they were ashamed of
     themselves) about
     <pb n="33"/> yesterday's adventure at "The Cow and Hedge." Afterwards made up my mind not to
     write <hi>yet</hi>.</p>
    <p><label>April 17.</label>—Thought I would write a kind little note to Gowing and Cummings
     about last Sunday, and warning them against Mr. Stillbrook. Afterwards, thinking the matter
     over, tore up the letters, and determined not to <hi>write</hi> at all, but to <hi>speak</hi>
     quietly to them. Dumbfounded at receiving a sharp letter from Cummings, saying that both he and
     Gowing had been waiting for an explanation of <hi>my</hi> (mind you, MY) extraordinary conduct
     coming home on Sunday. At last I wrote: "I thought <hi>I</hi> was the aggrieved party; but as I
     freely forgive you, you—feeling yourself aggrieved—should bestow forgiveness on me." I have
     copied this <foreign>verbatim</foreign> in the diary, because I think it is one of the most
     perfect and thoughtful sentences I have ever written. I posted the letter, but in my own heart
     I felt I was actually apologising for having been insulted.</p>
    <p><label>April 18.</label>—Am in for a cold. Spent the whole day at the office sneezing. In the
     evening, the cold being intolerable, sent Sarah out for a bottle of Kinahan. Fell asleep in the
     arm-chair, and woke with the shivers. Was startled by a loud knock at
     <pb n="34"/> the front-door. Carrie awfully flurried. Sarah still out, so went up, opened the
     door, and found it was only Cummings. Remembered the grocer's boy had again broken the
     side-bell. Cummings squeezed my hand, and said: "I've just seen Gowing. All right. Say no more
     about it." There is no doubt they are both under the impression I have apologised.</p>
    <p>While playing dominoes with Cummings in the parlour, he said: "By-the-by, do you want any
     wine or spirits? My cousin Merton has just set up in the trade, and has a splendid whisky, four
     years in bottle, at thirty-eight shillings. It is worth your while laying down a few dozen of
     it." I told him my cellars, which were very small, were full up. To my horror, at that very
     moment, Sarah entered the room, and putting a bottle of whisky, wrapped in a dirty piece of
     newspaper, on the table in front of us, said: "Please, sir, the grocer says he ain't got no
     more Kinahan, but you'll find this very good at two-and-six, with twopence returned on the
     bottle; and, please, did you want any more sherry? as he has some at one-and-three, as dry as a
     nut!"</p>

    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
    <p>A conversation with Mr. Merton on Society. Mr. and Mrs. James, of Sutton, come up. A
     miserable evening at the Tank Theatre. Experiments with enamel paint. I make another good joke;
     but Gowing and Cummings are unnecessarily offended. I paint the bath red, with unexpected
     result.</p>
    <p><label>April 19</label>—Cummings called, bringing with him his friend Merton, who is in the
     wine trade. Gowing also called. Mr. Merton made himself at home at once, and Carrie and I were
     both struck with him immediately, and thoroughly approved of his sentiments.</p>
    <p>He leaned back in his chair and said: "You must take me as I am;" and I replied: "Yes—and you
     must take us as we are. We're homely people, we are not swells."</p>
    <p>He answered: "No, I can see that," and Gowing roared with laughter; but Merton in a most
     gentlemanly
     <pb n="40"/> manner said to Gowing, "I don't think you quite understand me. I intended to
     convey that our charming host and hostess were superior to the follies of fashion, and
     preferred leading a simple and wholesome life to gadding about to twopenny-halfpenny
     tea-drinking afternoons, and living above their incomes."</p>
    <p>I was immensely pleased with these sensible remarks of Merton's, and concluded that subject
     by saying: "No, candidly, Mr. Merton, we don't go into Society, because we do not care for it;
     and what with the expense of cabs here and cabs there, and white gloves and white ties,
     etc., it doesn't seem worth the money."</p>
    <p>Merton said in reference to <hi>friends</hi>, "My motto is 'Few and True;' and, by the way, I
     also apply that to wine, 'Little and Good.'" Gowing said: "Yes, and sometimes 'cheap and
     tasty,' eh, old man?" Merton still continuing, said he should treat me as a friend, and put me
     down for a dozen of his "Lockanbar" whisky, and as I was an old friend of Gowing, I should have
     it for 36<hi>s.</hi>, which was considerably under what he paid for it.</p>
    <p>He booked his own order, and further said that at any time I wanted any passes for the
     theatre
     <pb n="41"/> I was to let him know, as his name stood good for any theatre in London.</p>
    <p><label>April 20.</label>—Carrie reminded me that as her old school friend, Annie Fullers (now
     Mrs. James), and her husband had come up from Sutton for a few days, it would look kind to take
     them to the theatre, and would I drop a line to Mr. Merton asking him for passes for four,
     either for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum. I wrote Merton to that effect.</p>
    <p><label>April 21.</label>—Got a reply from Merton, saying he was very busy, and just at
     present couldn't manage passes for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum, but the best
     thing going on in London was the <title>Brown Bushes</title>, at the Tank Theatre, Islington,
     and enclosed seats for four; also bill for whisky.</p>
    <p><label>April 23.</label>—Mr. and Mrs. James (Miss Fullers that was), came to meat tea, and we
     left directly after for the Tank Theatre. We got a 'bus that took us to King's Cross, and then
     changed into one that took us to the "Angel." Mr. James each time insisting on paying for all,
     saying that I had paid for the tickets and that was quite enough.</p>
    <pb n="42"/>
    <p>We arrived at theatre, where, curiously enough, all our 'bus-load except an old woman with a
     basket seemed to be going in. I walked ahead and presented the tickets. The man looked at them,
     and called out "Mr. Willowly! do you know anything about these?" holding up my tickets. The
     gentleman called to, came up and examined my tickets, and said: "Who gave you these?" I said
     rather indignantly: "Mr. Merton, of course." He said: "Merton? Who's he?" I answered rather
     sharply, "You ought to know, his name's good at any theatre in London." He replied: "Oh! is it?
     Well, it ain't no good here. These tickets which are <hi>not</hi> dated, were issued under Mr.
     Swinstead's management, which has since changed hands." While I was having some very unpleasant
     words with the man, James, who had gone upstairs with the ladies, called out: "Come on!" I went
     up after them, and a very civil attendant said: "This way, please, box H." I said to James:
     "Why, how on earth did you manage it?" and to my horror he replied: "Why, paid for it of
     course."</p>
    <p>This was humiliating enough, and I could scarcely follow the play, but I was doomed to still
     further humiliation. I was leaning out of
     <pb n="43"/> the box, when my tie—a little black bow which fastened on to the stud by means of
     a new patent—fell into the pit below. A clumsy man not noticing it, had his foot on it for ever
     so long before he discovered it. He then picked it up and eventually flung it under the next
     seat in disgust. What with the box incident and the tie, I felt quite miserable. Mr. James, of
     Sutton, was very good. He said: "Don't worry—no one will notice it with your beard. That is the
     only advantage of growing one that I can see." There was no occasion for that remark, for
     Carrie is very proud of my beard.</p>
    <p>To hide the absence of the tie I had to keep my chin down the rest of the evening, which
     caused a pain at the back of my neck.</p>
    <p><label>April 24.</label>—Could scarcely sleep a wink through thinking of having brought up
     Mr. and Mrs. James from the country to go to the theatre last night, and his having paid for a
     private box because our order was not honoured; and such a poor play too. I wrote a very
     satirical letter to Merton, the wine merchant, who gave us the pass, and said, "Considering we
     had to <hi>pay</hi> for our seats, we did our <hi>best</hi> to appreciate the performance." I
     thought this line
     <pb n="44"/> rather cutting, and I asked Carrie how many p's there were in appreciate, and she
     said, "One." After I sent off the letter I looked at the dictionary and found there were two.
     Awfully vexed at this.</p>
    <p>Decided not to worry myself any more about the James's; for, as Carrie wisely said, "We'll
     make it all right with them by asking them up from Sutton one evening next week, to play at
     Bézique."</p>
    <p><label>April 25.</label>—In consequence of Brickwell telling me his wife was working wonders
     with the new Pinkford's enamel paint, I determined to try it. I bought two tins of red on my
     way home. I hastened through tea, went into the garden and painted some flower-pots. I called
     out Carrie, who said: "You've always got some new-fangled craze;" but she was obliged to admit
     that the flower-pots looked remarkably well. Went upstairs into the servant's bedroom and
     painted her washstand, towel-horse, and chest of drawers. To my mind it was an extraordinary
     improvement, but as an example of the ignorance of the lower classes in the matter of taste,
     our servant Sarah, on seeing them, evinced no sign of pleasure, but merely said: "she thought
     they looked very well as they was before."</p>
    <pb n="45"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic45"/>


    <p><label>April 26.</label>—Got some more red enamel paint (red, to my mind, being the best
     colour), and painted the coal-scuttle, and the backs of our <title>Shakspeare</title>, the
     binding of which had almost worn out.</p>
    <pb n="46"/>
    <p><label>April 27.</label>—Painted the bath red, and was delighted with the result. Sorry to
     say Carrie was not, in fact we had a few words about it. She said I ought to have consulted
     her, and she had never heard of such a thing as a bath being painted red. I replied: "It's
     merely a matter of taste."</p>
    <p>Fortunately, further argument on the subject was stopped by a voice saying, "May I come in?"
     It was only Cummings, who said, "Your maid opened the door, and asked me to excuse her showing
     me in, as she was wringing out some socks." I was delighted to see him, and suggested we should
     have a game of whist with a dummy, and by way of merriment said: "<hi>You</hi> can be the
     dummy." Cummings (I thought rather ill-naturedly) replied: "Funny as usual." He said he
     couldn't stop, he only called to leave me the <title>Bicycle News</title>, as he had done with
     it.</p>
    <p>Another ring at the bell; it was Gowing, who said "he must apologise for coming so often, and
     that one of these days <hi>we</hi> must come round to <hi>him</hi>." I said: "A very
     extraordinary thing has struck me." "Something funny, as usual," said Cummings. "Yes," I
     replied; "I think even <hi>you</hi> will say so this time. It's concerning you both; for
     doesn't it seem odd that Gowing's always <hi>coming</hi>, and Cumming's always <hi>going?</hi>"
     <pb n="47"/> Carrie, who had evidently quite forgotten about the bath, went into fits of
     laughter, and as for myself, I fairly doubled up in my chair, till it cracked beneath me. I
     think this was one of the best jokes I have ever made.</p>
    <p>Then imagine my astonishment on perceiving both Cummings and Gowing perfectly silent, and
     without a smile on their faces. After rather an unpleasant pause, Cummings, who had opened a
     cigar-case, closed it up again and said: "Yes—I think, after that, I <hi>shall</hi> be going,
     and I am sorry I fail to see the fun of your jokes." Gowing said he didn't mind a joke when it
     wasn't rude, but a pun on a name, to his thinking, was certainly a little wanting in good
     taste. Cummings followed it up by saying, if it had been said by any one else but myself, he
     shouldn't have entered the house again. This rather unpleasantly terminated what might have
     been a cheerful evening. However, it was as well they went, for the charwoman had finished up
     the remains of the cold pork.</p>
    <p><label>April 28.</label>—At the office, the new and very young clerk Pitt, who was very
     impudent to me a week or so ago, was late again. I told him it would be my duty to inform Mr.
     Perkupp, the principal. To my
     <pb n="48"/> surprise Pitt apologised most humbly and in a most gentlemanly fashion. I was
     unfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in his manner towards me, and told him I would
     look over his unpunctuality. Passing down the room an hour later, I received a smart smack in
     the face from a rolled-up ball of hard foolscap. I turned round sharply, but all the clerks
     were apparently riveted to their work. I am not a rich man, but I would give half-a-sovereign
     to know whether that was thrown by accident or design. Went home early and bought some more
     enamel paint-black this time—and spent the evening touching up the fender, picture-frames, and
     an old pair of boots, making them look as good as new. Also painted Gowing's walking-stick,
     which he left behind, and made it look like ebony.</p>
    <p><label>April 29, Sunday.</label>—Woke up with a fearful headache and strong symptoms of a
     cold. Carrie, with a perversity which is just like her, said it was "painter's colic," and was
     the result of my having spent the last few days with my nose over a paint-pot. I told her
     firmly that I knew a great deal better what was the matter with me than she did. I had got a
     chill, and decided to have a bath as hot as I could bear it. Bath ready—could scarcely bear
     <pb n="49"/> it so hot. I persevered, and got in; very hot, but very acceptable. I lay still
     for some time.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic49"/>


    <p>On moving my hand above the surface of the water, I experienced the greatest fright I ever
     received in the whole course of my life; for imagine my horror on discovering my hand, as I
     thought, full of blood.
     <pb n="50"/> My first thought was that I had ruptured an artery, and was bleeding to death, and
     should be discovered, later on, looking like a second Marat, as I remember seeing him in Madame
     Tussaud's. My second thought was to ring the bell, but remembered there was no bell to ring. My
     third was, that there was nothing but the enamel paint, which had dissolved with boiling water.
     I stepped out of the bath, perfectly red all over, resembling the Red Indians I have seen
     depicted at an East-End theatre. I determined not to say a word to Carrie, but to tell
     Farmerson to come on Monday and paint the bath white.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
    <p>The Ball at the Mansion House.</p>
    <p><label>April 30</label>—Perfectly astounded at receiving an invitation for Carrie and myself
     from the Lord and Lady Mayoress to the Mansion House, to "meet the Represen­tatives of Trades
     and Commerce." My heart beat like that of a schoolboy's. Carrie and I read the invitation over
     two or three times. I could scarcely eat my breakfast. I said—and I felt it from the bottom of
     my heart,—"Carrie darling, I was a proud man when I led you down the aisle of the church on our
     wedding-day; that pride will be equalled, if not surpassed, when I lead my dear, pretty wife up
     to the Lord and Lady Mayoress at the Mansion House." I saw the tears in Carrie's eyes, and she
     said: "Charlie dear, it is <hi>I</hi> who have to be proud of you. And I am very, very proud of
     you. You have called me pretty; and as long as I am pretty in your eyes, I am happy. You, dear
     old Charlie, are <hi>not</hi> handsome, but you are <hi>good</hi>, which is far more noble." I
     gave her a kiss, and she said:
     <pb n="54"/> "I wonder if there will be any dancing? I have not danced with you for years."</p>
    <p>I cannot tell what induced me to do it, but I seized her round the waist, and we were silly
     enough to be executing a wild kind of polka when Sarah entered, grinning, and said: "There is a
     man, mum, at the door who wants to know if you want any good coals." Most annoyed at this.
     Spent the evening in answering, and tearing up again, the reply to the Mansion House, having
     left word with Sarah if Gowing or Cummings called we were not at home. Must consult Mr. Perkupp
     how to answer the Lord Mayor's invitation.</p>
    <p><label>May 1.</label>—Carrie said: "I should like to send mother the invitation to look at."
     I consented, as soon as I had answered it. I told Mr. Perkupp, at the office, with a feeling of
     pride, that we had received an invitation to the Mansion House; and he said, to my
     astonishment, that he himself gave in my name to the Lord Mayor's secretary. I felt this rather
     discounted the value of the invitation, but I thanked him; and in reply to me, he described how
     I was to answer it. I felt the reply was too simple; but of course Mr. Perkupp knows best.</p>
    <pb n="55"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic55"/>



    <pb n="56"/>
    <p><label>May 2.</label>—Sent my dress-coat and trousers to the little tailor's round the
     corner, to have the creases taken out. Told Gowing not to call next Monday, as we were going to
     the Mansion House. Sent similar note to Cummings.</p>
    <p><label>May 3.</label>—Carrie went to Mrs. James, at Sutton, to consult about her dress for
     next Monday. While speaking incidentally to Spotch, one of our head clerks, about the Mansion
     House, he said: "Oh, I'm asked, but don't think I shall go." When a vulgar man like Spotch is
     asked, I feel my invitation is considerably discounted. In the evening, while I was out, the
     little tailor brought round my coat and trousers, and because Sarah had not a shilling to pay
     for the pressing, he took them away again.</p>
    <p><label>May 4.</label>—Carrie's mother returned the Lord Mayor's invitation, which was sent to
     her to look at, with apologies for having upset a glass of port over it. I was too angry to say
     anything.</p>
    <p><label>May 5.</label>—Bought a pair of lavender kid-gloves for next Monday, and two white
     ties, in case one got spoiled in the tying.</p>
    <pb n="57"/>
    <p><label>May 6, Sunday.</label>—A very dull sermon, during which, I regret to say, I twice
     thought of the Mansion House reception to-morrow.</p>
    <p><label>May 7.</label>—A big red-letter day; viz., the Lord Mayor's reception. The whole house
     upset. I had to get dressed at half-past six, as Carrie wanted the room to herself. Mrs. James
     had come up from Sutton to help Carrie; so I could not help thinking it unreasonable that she
     should require the entire attention of Sarah, the servant, as well. Sarah kept running out of
     the house to fetch "something for missis," and several times I had, in my full evening-dress,
     to answer the back-door.</p>
    <p>The last time it was the greengrocer's boy, who, not seeing it was me, for Sarah had not
     lighted the gas, pushed into my hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal-blocks. I indignantly
     threw them on the ground, and felt so annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy's
     ears. He went away crying, and said he should summons me, a thing I would not have happen for
     the world. In the dark, I stepped on a piece of the cabbage, which brought me down on the flags
     all of a heap. For a moment I was stunned, but when I recovered I crawled upstairs into the
     drawing-room, and on looking into the chimney-glass
     <pb n="59"/> discovered that my chin was bleeding, my shirt smeared with the coal-blocks, and
     my left trouser torn at the knee.</p>
    <pb n="[58]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic58"/>


    <p>However, Mrs. James brought me down another shirt, which I changed in the drawing-room. I put
     a piece of court-plaister on my chin, and Sarah very neatly sewed up the tear at the knee. At
     nine o'clock Carrie swept into the room, looking like a queen. Never have I seen her look so
     lovely, or so distinguished. She was wearing a satin dress of sky-blue—my favourite colour—and
     a piece of lace, which Mrs. James lent her, round the shoulders, to give a finish. I thought
     perhaps the dress was a little too long behind, and decidedly too short in front, but Mrs.
     James said it was <foreign>à la mode</foreign>. Mrs. James was most kind, and lent Carrie a fan
     of ivory with red feathers, the value of which, she said, was priceless, as the feathers
     belonged to the Kachu eagle—a bird now extinct. I preferred the little white fan which Carrie
     bought for three-and-six at Shoolbred's, but both ladies sat on me at once.</p>
    <p>We arrived at the Mansion House too early, which was rather fortunate, for I had an
     opportunity of speaking to his lordship, who graciously condescended to talk with me some
     minutes; but I
     <pb n="60"/> must say I was disappointed to find he did not even know Mr. Perkupp, our
     principal.</p>
    <p>I felt as if we had been invited to the Mansion House by one who did not know the Lord Mayor
     himself. Crowds arrived, and I shall never forget the grand sight. My humble pen can never
     describe it. I was a little annoyed with Carrie, who kept saying: "Isn't it a pity we don't
     know anybody?"</p>
    <p>Once she quite lost her head. I saw someone who looked like Franching, from Peckham, and was
     moving towards him when she seized me by the coat-tails, and said, quite loudly: "Don't leave
     me," which caused an elderly gentleman, in a court-suit, and a chain round him, and two ladies,
     to burst out laughing. There was an immense crowd in the supper-room, and, my stars! it was a
     splendid supper—any amount of champagne.</p>
    <p>Carrie made a most hearty supper, for which I was pleased; for I sometimes think she is not
     strong. There was scarcely a dish she did not taste. I was so thirsty, I could not eat much.
     Receiving a sharp slap on the shoulder, I turned, and, to my amazement, saw Farmerson, our
     ironmonger. He said, in the most familiar way: "This is better than Brickfield Terrace, eh?" I
     simply looked at
     <pb n="61"/> him, and said coolly: "I never expected to see you here." He said, with a loud,
     coarse laugh: "I like that—if <hi>you</hi>, why not <hi>me?</hi>" I replied: "Certainly." I
     wish I could have thought of something better to say. He said: "Can I get your good lady
     anything?" Carrie said: "No, I thank you," for which I was pleased. I said, by way of reproof
     to him: "You never sent to-day to paint the bath, as I requested." Farmerson said: "Pardon me,
     Mr. Pooter, no shop when we're in company, please."</p>
    <p>Before I could think of a reply, one of the sheriffs, in full Court costume, slapped
     Farmerson on the back and hailed him as an old friend, and asked him to dine with him at his
     lodge. I was astonished. For full five minutes they stood roaring with laughter, and stood
     digging each other in the ribs. They kept telling each other they didn't look a day older. They
     began embracing each other and drinking champagne.</p>
    <p>To think that a man who mends our scraper should know any member of our aristocracy! I was
     just moving with Carrie, when Farmerson seized me rather roughly by the collar, and, addressing
     the Sheriff, said: "Let me introduce my neighbour, Pooter." He did not even say "Mister." The
     <pb n="62"/> Sheriff handed me a glass of champagne, I felt, after all, it was a great honour
     to drink a glass of wine with him, and I told him so. We stood chatting for some time, and at
     last I said: "You must excuse me now if I join Mrs. Pooter." When I approached her, she said:
     "Don't let me take you away from friends. I am quite happy standing here alone in a crowd,
     knowing nobody!"</p>
    <p>As it takes two to make a quarrel, and as it was neither the time nor the place for it, I
     gave my arm to Carrie, and said: "I hope my darling little wife will dance with me, if only for
     the sake of saying we had danced at the Mansion House, as guests of the Lord Mayor." Finding
     the dancing after supper was less formal, and knowing how much Carrie used to admire my dancing
     in the days gone by, I put my arm round her waist and we commenced a waltz.</p>
    <p>A most unfortunate accident occurred. I had got on a new pair of boots. Foolishly, I had
     omitted to take Carrie's advice; namely, to scratch the soles of them with the points of the
     scissors or to put a little wet on them. I had scarcely started when, like lightning, my left
     foot slipped away and I came down, the side of my head striking the floor with such violence
     that for a second or two I did not know what had
     <pb n="63"/> happened. I need hardly say that Carrie fell with me with equal violence, breaking
     the comb in her hair and grazing her elbow.</p>
    <p>There was a roar of laughter, which was immediately checked when people found that we had
     really hurt ourselves. A gentleman assisted Carrie to a seat, and I expressed myself pretty
     strongly on the danger of having a plain polished floor with no carpet or drugget to prevent
     people slipping. The gentleman, who said his name was Darwitts, insisted on escorting Carrie to
     have a glass of wine, an invitation which I was pleased to allow Carrie to accept.</p>
    <p>I followed, and met Farmerson, who immediately said, in his loud voice: "Oh, are you the one
     who went down?"</p>
    <p>I answered with an indignant look.</p>
    <p>With execrable taste, he said: "Look here, old man, we are too old for this game. We must
     leave these capers to the youngsters. Come and have another glass, that is more in our
     line."</p>
    <p>Although I felt I was buying his silence by accepting, we followed the others into the
     supper-room.</p>
    <p>Neither Carrie nor I, after our unfortunate mishap,
     <pb n="64"/> felt inclined to stay longer. As we were departing, Farmerson said: "Are you
     going? if so, you might give me a lift."</p>
    <p>I thought it better to consent, but wish I had first consulted Carrie.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
    <p>After the Mansion House Ball. Carrie offended. Gowing also offended. A pleasant party at the
     Cummings'. Mr. Franching, of Peckham, visits us.</p>
    <p><label>May 8</label>—I woke up with a most terrible headache. I could scarcely see, and the
     back of my neck was as if I had given it a crick. I thought first of sending for a doctor; but
     I did not think it necessary. When up, I felt faint, and went to Brownish's, the chemist, who
     gave me a draught. So bad at the office, had to get leave to come home. Went to another chemist
     in the City, and I got a draught. Brownish's dose seems to have made me worse; have eaten
     nothing all day. To make matters worse, Carrie, every time I spoke to her, answered me
     sharply—that is, when she answered at all.</p>
    <p>In the evening I felt very much worse again and said to her: "I do believe I've been poisoned
     by the lobster mayonnaise at the Mansion House last night;" she simply replied, without taking
     her eyes from her
     <pb n="68"/> sewing: "Champagne never did agree with you." I felt irritated, and said: "What
     nonsense you talk; I only had a glass and a half, and you know as well as I do——" Before I
     could complete the sentence she bounced out of the room. I sat over an hour waiting for her to
     return; but as she did not, I determined I would go to bed. I discovered Carrie had gone to bed
     without even saying "good-night"; leaving me to bar the scullery door and feed the cat. I shall
     certainly speak to her about this in the morning.</p>
    <p><label>May 9.</label>—Still a little shaky, with black specs. The <title>Blackfriars
      Bi-weekly News</title>, contains a long list of the guests at the Mansion House ball.
     Disappointed to find our names omitted, though Farmerson's is in plainly enough with M.L.L.
     after it, whatever that may mean. More than vexed because we had ordered a dozen copies to send
     to our friends. Wrote to the <title>Blackfriars Bi-weekly News</title>, pointing out their
     omission.</p>
    <p>Carrie had commenced her breakfast when I entered the parlour. I helped myself to a cup of
     tea, and I said, perfectly calmly and quietly: "Carrie, I wish a little explanation of your
     conduct last night."</p>
    <pb n="69"/>
    <p>She replied, "Indeed! and I desire something more than a <hi>little</hi> explanation of your
     conduct the night before."</p>
    <p>I said, coolly: "Really, I don't understand you."</p>
    <p>Carrie said sneeringly: "Probably not; you were scarcely in a condition to understand
     anything."</p>
    <p>I was astounded at this insinuation and simply ejaculated: "Caroline!"</p>
    <p>She said: "Don't be theatrical, it has no effect on me. Reserve that tone for your new
     friend. <hi>Mister</hi> Farmerson, the ironmonger."</p>
    <p>I was about to speak, when Carrie, in a temper such as I have never seen her in before, told
     me to hold my tongue. She said: "Now <hi>I'm</hi> going to say something! After professing to
     snub Mr. Farmerson, you permit him to snub <hi>you</hi>, in my presence, and then accept his
     invitation to take a glass of champagne with you, and you don't limit yourself to one glass.
     You then offer this vulgar man, who made a bungle of repairing our scraper, a seat in our cab
     on the way home. I say nothing about his tearing my dress in getting in the cab, nor of
     treading on Mrs. James's expensive fan, which you knocked out of my hand, and for which he
     never
     <pb n="70"/> even apologised; but you smoked all the way home without having the decency to ask
     my permission. That is not all! At the end of the journey, although he did not offer you a
     farthing towards his share of the cab, you asked him in. Fortunately, he was sober enough to
     detect, from my manner, that his company was not desirable."</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic70"/>


    <p>Goodness knows I felt humiliated enough at this; but, to make matters worse, Gowing entered
     the room, without knocking, with two hats on his head and holding the garden-rake in his hand,
     with Carrie's fur tippet (which he had taken off the downstairs hall-peg) round his neck, and
     announced himself in a loud, coarse voice: "His Royal Highness, the Lord Mayor!" He marched
     twice round the
     <pb n="71"/> room like a buffoon, and, finding we took no notice, said: "Hulloh! what's up?
     Lovers' quarrel, eh?"</p>
    <p>There was a silence for a moment, so I said quietly: "My dear Gowing, I'm not very well, and
     not quite in the humour for joking; especially when you enter the room without knocking, an act
     which I fail to see the fun of."</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "I'm very sorry, but I called for my stick, which I thought you would have sent
     round." I handed him his stick, which I remembered I had painted black with the enamel paint,
     thinking to improve it. He looked at it for a minute with a dazed expression and said: "Who did
     this?"</p>
    <p>I said: "Eh? Did what?"</p>
    <p>He said: "Did what? Why, destroyed my stick! It belonged to my poor uncle, and I value it
     more than anything I have in the world! I'll know who did it."</p>
    <p>I said: "I'm very sorry. I daresay it will come off. I did it for the best."</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "Then all I can say is, it's a confounded liberty; and I <hi>would</hi> add,
     you're a bigger fool than you look, only <hi>that's</hi> absolutely impossible."</p>
    <pb n="72"/>
    <p><label>May 12.</label>—Got a single copy of the <title>Blackfriars Bi-weekly News</title>.
     There was a short list of several names they had omitted; but the stupid people had mentioned
     our names as "Mr. and Mrs. C. Porter." Most annoying! Wrote again and I took particular care to
     write our name in capital letters, <hi>POOTER</hi>, so that there should be no possible mistake
     this time.</p>
    <p><label>May 16.</label>—Absolutely disgusted on opening the <title>Blackfriars Bi-weekly
      News</title> of to-day, to find the following paragraph: "We have received two letters from
     Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pewter, requesting us to announce the important fact that they were at the
     Mansion House Ball." I tore up the paper and threw it in the waste-paper basket. My time is far
     too valuable to bother about such trifles.</p>
    <p><label>May 21.</label>—The last week or ten days terribly dull, Carrie being away at Mrs.
     James's, at Sutton. Cummings also away. Gowing, I presume, is still offended with me for
     black-enamelling his stick without asking him.</p>
    <p><label>May 22.</label>—Purchased a new stick mounted with silver, which cost
     seven-and-sixpence (shall tell
     <pb n="73"/> Carrie five shillings), and sent it round with nice note to Gowing.</p>
    <p><label>May 23.</label>—Received strange note from Gowing; he says: "Offended? not a bit, my
     boy. I thought you were offended with me for losing my temper. Besides, I found after all, it
     was not my poor old uncle's stick you painted. It was only a shilling thing I bought at a
     tobacconist's. However, I am much obliged to you for your handsome present all same."</p>
    <p><label>May 24.</label>—Carrie back. Hoorah! She looks wonderfully well, except that the sun
     has caught her nose.</p>
    <p><label>May 25.</label>—Carrie brought down some of my shirts and advised me to take them to
     Trillip's round the corner. She said: "The fronts and cuffs are much frayed." I said without a
     moment's hesitation: "I'm <hi>'frayed</hi> they are." Lor! how we roared. I thought we should
     never stop laughing. As I happened to be sitting next the driver going to town on the 'bus, I
     told him my joke about the "frayed" shirts. I thought he would have rolled off his seat. They
     laughed at the office a good bit too over it.</p>
    <pb n="74"/>
    <p><label>May 26.</label>—Left the shirts to be repaired at Trillip's. I said to him: "I'm
      <hi>'fraid</hi> they are <hi>frayed</hi>." He said, without a smile: "They're bound to do
     that, sir." Some people seem to be quite destitute of a sense of humour.</p>
    <p>June 1.—The last week has been like old times, Carrie being back, and Gowing and Cummings
     calling every evening nearly. Twice we sat out in the garden quite late. This evening we were
     like a pack of children, and played "consequences." It is a good game.</p>
    <p><label>June 2.</label>—"Consequences" again this evening. Not quite so successful as last
     night; Gowing having several times over-stepped the limits of good taste.</p>
    <p><label>June 4.</label>—In the evening Carrie and I went round to Mr. and Mrs. Cummings' to
     spend a quiet evening with them. Gowing was there, also Mr. Stillbrook. It was quiet but
     pleasant. Mrs. Cummings sang five or six songs, "No, Sir," and "The Garden of Sleep," being
     best in my humble judgment; but what pleased me most was the duet she sang with
     Carrie—classical duet, too. I think
     <pb n="75"/> it is called, "I would that my love!" It was beautiful. If Carrie had been in
     better voice, I don't think professionals could have sung it better. After supper we made them
     sing it again. I never liked Mr. Stillbrook since the walk that Sunday to the "Cow and Hedge,"
     but I must say he sings comic-songs well. His song: "We don't Want the old men now," made us
     shriek with laughter, especially the verse referring to Mr. Gladstone; but there was one verse
     I think he might have omitted, and I said so, but Gowing thought it was the best of the
     lot.</p>
    <p><label>June 6.</label>—Trillip brought round the shirts and, to my disgust, his charge for
     repairing was more than I gave for them when new. I told him so, and he impertinently replied:
     "Well, they are better now than when they were new." I paid him, and said it was a robbery. He
     said: "If you wanted your shirt-fronts made out of pauper-linen, such as is used for packing
     and bookbinding, why didn't you say so?"</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic76"/>


    <p><label>June 7.</label>—A dreadful annoyance. Met Mr. Franching, who lives at Peckham, and who
     is a great swell in his way. I ventured to ask him to come home to meat-tea and take pot-luck.
     I did
     <pb n="76"/> not think he would accept such a humble invitation; but he did, saying, in a most
     friendly way, he would rather "peck" with us than by himself. I said: "We had better get into
     this blue 'bus." He replied: "No blue-bussing for me. I have had enough of the blues lately. I
     lost a cool 'thou' over the Copper Scare. Step in here."</p>
    <p>We drove up home in style, in a hansom-cab, and I knocked three times at the front door
     without getting an answer. I saw Carrie, through the panels of ground-glass (with stars),
     rushing up stairs. I told Mr. Franching to wait at the door while I went round to the side.
     There I saw the grocer's boy actually picking off the paint on the door, which had formed into
     blisters. No time to reprove him; so went round and effected an entrance through the kitchen
     window. I let in
     <pb n="78"/> Mr. Franching, and showed him into the drawing-room. I went up stairs to Carrie,
     who was changing her dress, and told her I had persuaded Mr. Franching to come home. She
     replied: "How can you do such a thing? You know it's Sarah's holiday, and there's not a thing
     in the house, the cold mutton having turned with the hot weather."</p>
    <pb n="[77]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic77"/>


    <p>Eventually Carrie, like a good creature as she is, slipped down, washed up the tea-cups, and
     laid the cloth, and I gave Franching our views of Japan to look at while I ran round to the
     butcher's to get three chops.</p>
    <p><label>July 30.</label>—The miserable cold weather is either upsetting me or Carrie, or both.
     We seem to break out into an argument about absolutely nothing, and this unpleasant state of
     things usually occurs at meal times.</p>
    <p>This morning, for some unaccountable reason, we were talking about balloons, and we were as
     merry as possible; but the conversation drifted into family matters, during which Carrie,
     without the slightest reason, referred in the most uncompli­mentary manner to my poor father's
     pecuniary trouble. I retorted by saying that "Pa, at all events, was a gentleman," whereupon
     Carrie burst
     <pb n="79"/> out crying. I positively could not eat any breakfast.</p>
    <p>At the office I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, who said he was very sorry, but I should have to
     take my annual holidays from next Saturday. Franching called at office and asked me to dine at
     his club, "The Constitutional." Fearing disagreeables at home after the "tiff" this morning, I
     sent a telegram to Carrie, telling her I was going out to dine and she was not to sit up.
     Bought a little silver bangle for Carrie.</p>
    <p><label>July 31.</label>—Carrie was very pleased with the bangle, which I left with an
     affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going to bed. I told Carrie we should
     have to start for our holiday next Saturday. She replied quite happily that she did not mind,
     except that the weather was so bad, and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get
     her a seaside dress in time. I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with pink bows looked
     quite good enough; and Carrie said she should not think of wearing it. I was about to discuss
     the matter, when, remembering the argument yesterday, resolved to hold my tongue.</p>
    <p>I said to Carrie: "I don't think we can
     <pb n="80"/> do better than 'Good old Broad­stairs.'" Carrie not only, to my astonishment,
     raised an objection to Broad­stairs, for the first time; but begged me not to use the
     expression, "Good old," but to leave it to Mr. Stillbrook and other <hi>gentlemen</hi> of his
     type. Hearing my 'bus pass the window, I was obliged to rush out of the house without kissing
     Carrie as usual, and I shouted to her: "I leave it to you to decide." On returning in the
     evening, Carrie said she thought as the time was so short she had decided on Broad­stairs, and
     had written to Mrs. Beck, Harbour View Terrace, for apartments.</p>
    <p><label>August 1.</label>—Ordered a new pair of trousers at Edwards's, and told them not to
     cut them so loose over the boot; the last pair being so loose and also tight at the knee,
     looked like a sailor's, and I heard Pitt, that objectionable youth at the office, call out
     "Hornpipe" as I passed his desk. Carrie has ordered of Miss Jibbons a pink Garibaldi and
     blue-serge skirt, which I always think looks so pretty at the seaside. In the evening she
     trimmed herself a little sailor-hat, while I read to her the <title>Exchange and Mart</title>.
     We had a good laugh over my trying on the hat when she had finished it; Carrie saying it looked
     so funny with my beard, and how the
     <pb n="81"/> people would have roared if I went on the stage like it.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic81"/>


    <p><label>August 2.</label>—Mrs. Beck wrote to say we could have our usual rooms at
     Broad­stairs. That's off our mind. Bought a coloured shirt and a pair of
     <pb n="82"/> tan-coloured boots, which I see many of the swell clerks wearing in the City, and
     I hear are all the "go."</p>
    <p><label>August 3.</label>—A beautiful day. Looking forward to to-morrow. Carrie bought a
     parasol about five feet long. I told her it was ridiculous. She said: "Mrs. James, of Sutton,
     has one twice as long;" so the matter dropped. I bought a capital hat for hot weather at the
     seaside. I don't know what it is called, but it is the shape of the helmet worn in India, only
     made of straw. Got three new ties, two coloured handkerchiefs, and a pair of navy-blue socks at
     Pope Brothers. Spent the evening packing. Carrie told me not to forget to borrow Mr.
     Higgsworth's telescope, which he always lends me, knowing I know how to take care of it. Sent
     Sarah out for it. While everything was seeming so bright, the last post brought us a letter
     from Mrs. Beck, saying: "I have just let all my house to one party, and am sorry I must take
     back my words, and am sorry you must find other apartments; but Mrs. Womming, next door, will
     be pleased to accommodate you, but she cannot take you before Monday, as her rooms are engaged
     Bank Holiday week."</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
    <p>The Unexpected Arrival Home of our Son, Willie Lupin Pooter.</p>
    <p><label>August 4</label>—The first post brought a nice letter from our dear son Willie,
     acknowledging a trifling present which Carrie sent him, the day before yesterday being his
     twentieth birthday. To our utter amazement he turned up himself in the afternoon, having
     journeyed all the way from Oldham. He said he had got leave from the bank, and as Monday was a
     holiday he thought he would give us a little surprise.</p>
    <p><label>August 5, Sunday.</label>—We have not seen Willie since last Christmas, and are
     pleased to notice what a fine young man he has grown. One would scarcely believe he was
     Carrie's son. He looks more like a younger brother. I rather disapprove of his wearing a check
     suit on a Sunday, and I think he ought to have gone to church this morning; but he said he was
     tired after yesterday's journey, so I refrained
     <pb n="86"/> from any remark on the subject. We had a bottle of port for dinner, and drank dear
     Willie's health.</p>
    <p>He said: "Oh, by-the-by, did I tell you I've cut my first name, 'William,' and taken the
     second name 'Lupin'? In fact, I'm only known at Oldham as 'Lupin Pooter.' If you were to
     'Willie' me there, they wouldn't know what you meant."</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic86"/>


    <p>Of course, Lupin being a purely family name, Carrie was delighted, and began by giving a long
     history of the Lupins. I ventured to say that I thought William a nice simple name, and
     reminded him he was christened after his Uncle William, who was much respected in the City.
     Willie, in a manner which I did not much care for, said sneeringly: "Oh, I know all about
     that—Good
     <pb n="87"/> old Bill!" and helped himself to a third glass of port.</p>
    <p>Carrie objected strongly to my saying "Good old," but she made no remark when Willie used the
     double adjective. I said nothing, but looked at her, which meant more. I said: "My dear Willie,
     I hope you are happy with your colleagues at the bank." He replied: "Lupin, if you please; and
     with respect to the bank, there's not a clerk who is a gentleman, and the 'boss' is a cad." I
     felt so shocked, I could say nothing, and my instinct told me there was something wrong.</p>
    <p><label>August 6, Bank Holiday.</label>—As there was no sign of Lupin moving at nine o'clock,
     I knocked at his door, and said we usually breakfasted at half-past eight, and asked how long
     would he be? Lupin replied that he had had a lively time of it, first with the train shaking
     the house all night, and then with the sun streaming in through the window in his eyes, and
     giving him a cracking headache. Carrie came up and asked if he would like some breakfast sent
     up, and he said he could do with a cup of tea, and didn't want anything to eat.</p>
    <p>Lupin not having come down, I went up again at half-past one, and said we dined at two; he
     <pb n="88"/> said he "would be there." He never came down till a quarter to three. I said: "We
     have not seen much of you, and you will have to return by the 5.30 train; therefore you will
     have to leave in an hour, unless you go by the midnight mail." He said: "Look here, Guv'nor,
     it's no use beating about the bush. I've tendered my resignation at the Bank."</p>
    <p>For a moment I could not speak. When my speech came again, I said: "How dare you, sir? How
     dare you take such a serious step without consulting me? Don't answer me, sir!—you will sit
     down immediately, and write a note at my dictation, withdrawing your resignation and amply
     apologising for your thought­lessness."</p>
    <p>Imagine my dismay when he replied with a loud guffaw: "It's no use. If you want the good old
     truth, I've got the chuck!"</p>
    <p><label>August 7.</label>—Mr. Perkupp has given me leave to postpone my holiday a week, as we
     could not get the room. This will give us an opportunity of trying to find an appointment for
     Willie before we go. The ambition of my life would be to get him into Mr. Perkupp's firm.</p>
    <pb n="89"/>
    <p><label>August 11.</label>—Although it is a serious matter having our boy Lupin on our hands,
     still it is satisfactory to know he was asked to resign from the Bank simply because "he took
     no interest in his work, and always arrived an hour (sometimes two hours) late." We can all
     start off on Monday to Broad­stairs with a light heart. This will take my mind off the worry of
     the last few days, which have been wasted over a useless correspondence with the manager of the
     Bank at Oldham.</p>
    <p><label>August 13.</label>—Hurrah! at Broad­stairs. Very nice apartments near the station. On
     the cliff they would have been double the price. The landlady had a nice five o'clock dinner
     and tea ready, which we all enjoyed, though Lupin seemed fastidious because there happened to
     be a fly in the butter. It was very wet in the evening, for which I was thankful, as it was a
     good excuse for going to bed early. Lupin said he would sit up and read a bit.</p>
    <p><label>August 14.</label>—I was a little annoyed to find Lupin, instead of reading last
     night, had gone to a common sort of entertainment, given at the Assembly Rooms. I expressed my
     opinion that such performances were unworthy of respectable
     <pb n="90"/> patronage; but he replied: "Oh, it was only 'for one night only.' I had a fit of
     the blues come on, and thought I would go to see Polly Presswell, England's Particular Spark."
     I told him I was proud to say I had never heard of her. Carrie said: "Do let the boy alone.
     He's quite old enough to take care of himself, and won't forget he's a gentleman. Remember you
     were young once yourself." Rained all day hard, but Lupin would go out.</p>
    <p><label>August 15.</label>—Cleared up a bit; so we all took the train to Margate, and the
     first person we met on the jetty was Gowing. I said: "Hulloh! I thought you had gone to
     Barmouth with your Birmingham friends?" He said: "Yes, but young Peter Lawrence was so ill,
     they postponed their visit, so I came down here. You know the Cummings' are here too?" Carrie
     said: "Oh, that will be delightful! We must have some evenings together and have games."</p>
    <p>I introduced Lupin, saying: "You will be pleased to find we have our dear boy at home!"
     Gowing said: "How's that? You don't mean to say he's left the Bank?"</p>
    <p>I changed the subject quickly, and thereby avoided any of those awkward questions which
     Gowing always has a knack of asking.</p>
    <pb n="91"/>
    <p><label>August 16.</label>—Lupin positively refused to walk down the Parade with me because I
     was wearing my new straw helmet with my frock-coat. I don't know what the boy is coming to.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic91"/>


    <p><label>August 17.</label>—Lupin not falling in with our views, Carrie and I went for a sail.
     It was a relief to be
     <pb n="92"/> with her alone; for when Lupin irritates me, she always sides with him. On our
     return, he said: "Oh, you've been on the 'Shilling Emetic,' have you? You'll come to
     six-pennorth on the 'Liver Jerker' next." I presume he meant a tricycle, but I affected not to
     understand him.</p>
    <p><label>August 18.</label>—Gowing and Cummings walked over to arrange an evening at Margate.
     It being wet, Gowing asked Cummings to accompany him to the hotel and have a game of billiards,
     knowing I never play, and in fact disapprove of the game. Cummings said he must hasten back to
     Margate; whereupon Lupin, to my horror, said: "I'll give you a game, Gowing-a hundred up. A
     walk round the cloth will give me an appetite for dinner." I said: "Perhaps <hi>Mister</hi>
     Gowing does not care to play with boys." Gowing surprised me by saying: "Oh yes, I do, if they
     play well," and they walked off together.</p>
    <p><label>August 19, Sunday.</label>—I was about to read Lupin a sermon on smoking (which he
     indulges in violently) and billiards, but he put on his hat and walked out. Carrie then read
      <hi>me</hi> a long sermon on the palpable inadvisability of treating Lupin as if he
     <pb n="93"/> were a mere child. I felt she was somewhat right, so in the evening I offered him
     a cigar. He seemed pleased, but, after a few whiffs, said: "This is a good old tup'ny-try one
     of mine," and he handed me a cigar as long as it was strong, which is saying a good deal.</p>
    <pb n="[94]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic94"/>


    <p><label>August 20.</label>—I am glad our last day at the seaside was fine, though clouded
     overhead. We went over to Cummings' (at Margate) in the evening, and as it was cold, we stayed
     in and played games; Gowing, as usual, overstepping the mark. He suggested we should play
     "Cutlets," a game we never heard of. He sat on a chair, and asked Carrie to sit on his lap, an
     invitation which dear Carrie rightly declined.</p>
    <p>After some species of wrangling, <hi>I</hi> sat on Gowing's knees and Carrie sat on the edge
     of mine. Lupin sat on the edge of Carrie's lap, then Cummings on Lupin's, and Mrs. Cummings on
     her husband's. We looked very ridiculous, and laughed a good deal.</p>
    <p>Gowing then said: "Are you a believer in the Great Mogul?" We had to answer all together:
     "Yes-oh, yes!" (three times). Gowing said: "So am I," and suddenly got up. The result of this
     <pb n="96"/> stupid joke was that we all fell on the ground, and poor Carrie banged her head
     against the corner of the fender. Mrs. Cummings put some vinegar on; but through this we missed
     the last train, and had to drive back to Broad­stairs, which cost me seven-and-sixpence.</p>

    <p>Home again. Mrs. James' influence on Carrie. Can get nothing for Lupin. Next-door neighbours

     us with an announcement.</p>

    <p><label>August 23.</label>—I bought a pair of stags' heads made of plaster-of-Paris and
     coloured brown. They will look just the thing for our little hall, and give it style; the heads
     are excellent imitations. Poolers and Smith are sorry they have nothing to offer Lupin.</p>
    <pb n="100"/>
    <p><label>August 24.</label>—Simply to please Lupin, and make things cheerful for him, as he is
     a little down, Carrie invited Mrs. James to come up from Sutton and spend two or three days
     with us. We have not said a word to Lupin, but mean to keep it as a surprise.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n=""/>


    <p><label>August 25.</label>—Mrs. James, of Sutton, arrived in the afternoon, bringing with her
     an enormous bunch of wild flowers. The more I see of Mrs. James the nicer I think she is, and
     she is devoted to Carrie. She went into Carrie's room to take off her bonnet, and remained
     there nearly an hour talking about dress. Lupin said he was not a bit surprised at Mrs. James'
      <hi>visit</hi>, but was surprised at <hi>her</hi>.</p>
    <p><label>August 26, Sunday.</label>—Nearly late for church, Mrs. James having talked
     considerably about what to
     <pb n="101"/> wear all the morning. Lupin does not seem to get on very well with Mrs. James. I
     am afraid we shall have some trouble with our next-door neighbours who came in last Wednesday.
     Several of their friends, who drive up in dog-carts, have already made themselves
     objectionable.</p>
    <p>An evening or two ago I had put on a white waistcoat for coolness, and while walking past
     with my thumbs in my waistcoat pockets (a habit I have), one man, seated in the cart, and
     looking like an American, commenced singing some vulgar nonsense about "<title>I had thirteen
      dollars in my waistcoat pocket</title>." I fancied it was meant for me, and my suspicions were
     confirmed; for while walking round the garden in my tall hat this afternoon, a "throw-down"
     cracker was deliberately aimed at my hat, and exploded on it like a percussion cap. I turned
     sharply, and am positive I saw the man who was in the cart retreating from one of the bedroom
     windows.</p>
    <p><label>August 27.</label>—Carrie and Mrs. James went off shopping, and had not returned when
     I came back from the office. Judging from the subsequent conversation, I am afraid Mrs. James
     is filling Carrie's head with a lot of nonsense about dress. I walked
     <pb n="102"/> over to Gowing's, and asked him to drop in to supper, and make things
     pleasant.</p>
    <p>Carrie prepared a little extemporised supper, consisting of the remainder of the cold joint,
     a small piece of salmon (which I was to refuse, in case there was not enough to go round), and
     a blanc-mange and custards. There was also a decanter of port and some jam puffs on the
     sideboard. Mrs. James made us play rather a good game with cards, called "Muggins." To my
     surprise, in fact disgust, Lupin got up in the middle, and, in a most sarcastic tone, said:
     "Pardon me, this sort of thing is too fast for me. I shall go and enjoy a quiet game of marbles
     in the back-garden."</p>
    <p>Things might have become rather disagreeable but for Gowing (who seems to have taken to
     Lupin) suggesting they should invent games. Lupin said: "Let's play 'monkeys.'" He then led
     Gowing all round the room, and brought him in front of the looking-glass. I must confess I
     laughed heartily at this. I was a little vexed at everybody subsequently laughing at some joke
     which they did not explain, and it was only on going to bed I discovered I must have been
     walking about all the evening with an antimacassar on one button of my coat-tails.</p>
    <pb n="103"/>
    <p><label>August 28.</label>—Found a large brick in the middle bed of geraniums, evidently come
     from next door. Pattles and Pattles can't find a place for Lupin.</p>
    <p><label>August 29.</label>—Mrs. James is making a positive fool of Carrie. Carrie appeared in
     a new dress like a smock-frock. She said "smocking" was all the rage. I replied it put me in a
     rage. She also had on a hat as big as a kitchen coal-scuttle, and the same shape. Mrs. James
     went home, and both Lupin and I were somewhat pleased-the first time we have agreed on a single
     subject since his return. Merkins and Son write they have no vacancy for Lupin.</p>
    <p><label>October 30.</label>—I should very much like to know who has wilfully torn the last
     five or six weeks out of my diary. It is perfectly monstrous! Mine is a large scribbling diary,
     with plenty of space for the record of my everyday events, and in keeping up that record I take
     (with much pride) a great deal of pains.</p>
    <p>I asked Carrie if she knew anything about it. She replied it was my own fault for leaving the
     diary about with a charwoman cleaning and the sweeps in the house. I said that was not an
     answer
     <pb n="104"/> to my question. This retort of mine, which I thought extremely smart, would have
     been more effective had I not jogged my elbow against a vase on a table temporarily placed in
     the passage, knocked it over, and smashed it.</p>
    <p>Carrie was dreadfully upset at this disaster, for it was one of a pair of vases which cannot
     be matched, given to us on our wedding-day by Mrs. Burtsett, an old friend of Carrie's cousins,
     the Pommertons, late of Dalston. I called to Sarah, and asked her about the diary. She said she
     had not been in the sitting-room at all; after the sweep had left, Mrs. Birrell (the charwoman)
     had cleaned the room and lighted the fire herself. Finding a burnt piece of paper in the grate,
     I examined it, and found it was a piece of my diary. So it was evident someone had torn my
     diary to light the fire. I requested Mrs. Birrell to be sent to me to-morrow.</p>
    <p><label>October 31.</label>—Received a letter from our principal, Mr. Perkupp, saying that he
     thinks he knows of a place at last for our dear boy Lupin. This, in a measure, consoles me for
     the loss of a portion of my diary; for I am bound to confess the last few weeks have been
     devoted to the record of disappointing
     <pb n="105"/> answers received from people to whom I had applied for appointments for Lupin.
     Mrs. Birrell called, and, in reply to me, said: "She never <hi>see</hi> no book, much less take
     such a liberty as <hi>touch it</hi>."</p>
    <p>I said I was determined to find out who did it, whereupon she said she would do her best to
     help me; but she remembered the sweep lighting the fire with a bit of the <title>Echo</title>.
     I requested the sweep to be sent to me to-morrow. I wish Carrie had not given Lupin a
     latch-key; we never seem to see anything of him. I sat up till past one for him, and then
     retired tired.</p>
    <p><label>November 1.</label>—My entry yesterday about "retired tired," which I did not notice
     at the time, is rather funny. If I were not so worried just now, I might have had a little joke
     about it. The sweep called, but had the audacity to come up to the hall-door and lean his dirty
     bag of soot on the door-step. He, however, was so polite, I could not rebuke him. He said Sarah
     lighted the fire. Unfortunately, Sarah heard this, for she was dusting the banisters, and she
     ran down, and flew into a temper with the sweep, causing a row on the front door-steps, which I
     would not have had happen for anything. I ordered her about her business, and told the sweep I
     was
     <pb n="106"/> sorry to have troubled him; and so I was, for the door-steps were covered with
     soot in consequence of his visit. I would willingly give ten shillings to find out who tore my
     diary.</p>
    <p><label>November 2.</label>—I spent the evening quietly with Carrie, of whose company I never
     tire. We had a most pleasant chat about the letters on "Is Marriage a Failure?" It has been no
     failure in our case. In talking over our own happy experiences, we never noticed that it was
     past midnight. We were startled by hearing the door slam violently. Lupin had come in. He made
     no attempt to turn down the gas in the passage, or even to look into the room where we were,
     but went straight up to bed, making a terrible noise. I asked him to come down for a moment,
     and he begged to be excused, as he was "dead beat," an observation that was scarcely consistent
     with the fact that, for a quarter of an hour afterwards, he was positively dancing in his room,
     and shouting out, "See me dance the polka!" or some such nonsense.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n=""/>


    <p><label>November 3.</label>—Good news at last. Mr. Perkupp has got an appointment for Lupin,
     and he is to go and see about it on Monday. Oh, how
     <pb n="107"/> my mind is relieved! I went to Lupin's room to take the good news to him, but he
     was in bed, very seedy, so I resolved to keep it over till the evening.</p>
    <p>He said he had last night been elected a member of an Amateur Dramatic Club, called the
     "Holloway Comedians"; and, though it was a pleasant evening, he had sat in a draught, and got
     neuralgia in the head. He declined have any breakfast, so I left him.</p>
    <p>In the evening I had up a special bottle of port, and, Lupin being in for a wonder, we filled
     our glasses, and I said: "Lupin my boy, I have some good and unexpected news for you. Mr.
     Perkupp has procured you an appointment!"
     <pb n="108"/> Lupin said: "Good biz!" and we drained our glasses.</p>
    <p>Lupin then said: "Fill up the glasses again, for I have some good and unexpected news for
     you."</p>
    <p>I had some slight misgivings, and so evidently had Carrie, for she said: "I hope we shall
     think it good news."</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Oh, it's all right! <hi>I'm engaged to be married!</hi>"</p>
    <pb n="109-110"/>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
    <p>Daisy Mutlar sole topic of conversation. Lupin's new berth. Fireworks at the Cummings'. The
     "Holloway Comedians." Sarah quarrels with the charwoman. Lupin's uncalled-for interference. Am
     introduced to Daisy Mutlar. We decide to give a party in her honour.</p>
    <p>ovember 5, <label>Sunday</label>—Carrie and I troubled about that mere boy Lupin getting
     engaged to be married without consulting us or anything. After dinner he told us all about it.
     He said the lady's name was Daisy Mutlar, and she was the nicest, prettiest, and most
     accomplished girl he ever met. He loved her the moment he saw her, and if he had to wait fifty
     years he would wait, and he knew she would wait for him.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="punch95-245"/>


    <p>Lupin further said, with much warmth, that the world was a different world to him now,-it was
     a world worth living in. He lived with an object now, and that was to make Daisy Mutlar-Daisy
     Pooter, and he would guarantee she would
     <pb n="114"/> not disgrace the family of the Pooters. Carrie here burst out crying, and threw
     her arms round his neck, and in doing so, upset the glass of port he held in his hand all over
     his new light trousers.</p>
    <p>I said I had no doubt we should like Miss Mutlar when we saw her, but Carrie said she loved
     her already. I thought this rather premature, but held my tongue. Daisy Mutlar was the sole
     topic of conversation for the remainder of the day. I asked Lupin who her people were, and he
     replied: "Oh, you know Mutlar, Williams and Watts." I did not know, but refrained from asking
     any further questions at present, for fear of irritating Lupin.</p>
    <p><label>November 6.</label>—Lupin went with me to the office, and had a long conversation with
     Mr. Perkupp, our principal, the result of which was that he accepted a clerkship in the firm of
     Job Cleanands &amp; Co., Stock and Share Brokers. Lupin told me, privately, it was an
     advertising firm, and he did not think much of it. I replied: "Beggars should not be choosers;"
     and I will do Lupin the justice to say, he looked rather ashamed of himself.</p>
    <p>In the evening we went round to the Cummings', to have a few fireworks. It began to rain, and
     I thought it rather dull. One of my squibs
     <pb n="115"/> would not go off, and Gowing said: "Hit it on your boot, boy; it will go off
     then." I gave it a few knocks on the end of my boot, and it went off with one loud explosion,
     and burnt my fingers rather badly. I gave the rest of the squibs to the little Cummings' boy to
     let off.</p>
    <p>Another unfortunate thing happened, which brought a heap of abuse on my head. Cummings
     fastened a large wheel set-piece on a stake in the ground by way of a grand finale. He made a
     great fuss about it; said it cost seven shillings. There was a little difficulty in getting it
     alight. At last it went off; but after a couple of slow revolutions, it stopped. I had my stick
     with me, so I gave it a tap to send it round, and, unfortunately, it fell off the stake on to
     the grass. Anybody would have thought I had set the house on fire from the way in which they
     stormed at me. I will never join in any more firework parties. It is a ridiculous waste of time
     and money.</p>
    <p><label>November 7.</label>—Lupin asked Carrie to call on Mrs. Mutlar, but Carrie said she
     thought Mrs. Mutlar ought to call on her first. I agreed with Carrie, and this led to an
     argument. However, the matter was settled by Carrie saying she could not
     <pb n="116"/> find any visiting-cards, and we must get some more printed, and when they were
     finished would be quite time enough to discuss the etiquette of calling.</p>
    <p><label>November 8.</label>—I ordered some of our cards at Black's, the stationer's. I ordered
     twenty-five of each, which will last us for a good long time. In the evening, Lupin brought in
     Harry Mutlar, Miss Mutlar's brother. He was rather a gawky youth, and Lupin said he was the
     most popular and best amateur in the club, referring to the "Holloway Comedians." Lupin
     whispered to us that if we could only "draw out" Harry a bit, he would make us roar with
     laughter.</p>
    <p>At supper, young Mutlar did several amusing things. He took up a knife, and with the flat
     part of it played a tune on his cheek in a wonderful manner. He also gave an imitation of an
     old man with no teeth, smoking a big cigar. The way he kept dropping the cigar sent Carrie into
     fits.</p>
    <p>In the course of conversation, Daisy's name cropped up, and young Mutlar said he would bring
     his sister round to us one evening-his parents being rather old-fashioned, and not going out
     much. Carrie said we would get up a little special party.
     <pb n="117"/> As young Mutlar showed no inclination to go, and it was approaching eleven
     o'clock, as a hint I reminded Lupin that he had to be up early to-morrow. Instead of taking the
     hint, Mutlar began a series of comic imitations. He went on for an hour without cessation. Poor
     Carrie could scarcely keep her eyes open. At last she made an excuse, and said
     "Good-night."</p>
    <p>Mutlar then left, and I heard him and Lupin whispering in the hall something about the
     "Holloway Comedians," and to my disgust, although it was past midnight, Lupin put on his hat
     and coat, and went out with his new companion.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="punch95-256"/>


    <p><label>November 9.</label>—My endeavours to discover who tore the sheets out of my diary
     still fruitless. Lupin has Daisy Mutlar on the brain, so we see little of him, except that he
     invariably turns up at meal times. Cummings dropped in.</p>
    <p><label>November 10.</label>—Lupin seems to like his new berth-that's a comfort. Daisy Mutlar
     the sole topic of conversation during tea. Carrie almost as full of it as Lupin. Lupin informs
     me, to my disgust, that he has been persuaded to take part in the forthcoming
     <pb n="118"/> performance of the "Holloway Comedians." He says he is to play Bob Britches in
     the farce, <title>Gone to my Uncle's</title>; Frank Mutlar is going to play Old Musty. I told
     Lupin pretty plainly I was not in the least degree interested in the matter, and totally
     disapproved of amateur theatricals. Gowing came in the evening.</p>
    <p><label>November 11.</label>—Returned home to find the house in a most disgraceful uproar.
     Carrie, who appeared very frightened, was standing outside her bedroom, while Sarah was excited
     and crying. Mrs. Birrell (the charwoman), who had evidently been drinking, was shouting at the
     top of her voice that "she was no thief, that she was a respectable woman, who had to work hard
     for her living, and she would smack anyone's face who put lies into her mouth." Lupin, whose
     back was towards me, did not hear me come in. He was standing between the two women, and, I
     regret to say, in his endeavour to act as peacemaker, he made use of rather strong language in
     the presence of his mother; and I was just in time to hear him say: "And all this fuss about
     the loss of a few pages from a rotten diary that wouldn't fetch three-halfpence a pound!" I
     said, quietly: "Pardon me, Lupin, that is a matter of opinion; and as I am
     <pb n="119"/> master of this house, perhaps you will allow me to take the reins."</p>
    <p>I ascertained that the cause of the row was, that Sarah had accused Mrs. Birrell of tearing
     the pages out of my diary to wrap up some kitchen fat and leavings which she had taken out of
     the house last week. Mrs. Birrell had slapped Sarah's face, and said she had taken nothing out
     of the place, as there was "never no leavings to take." I ordered Sarah back to her work, and
     requested Mrs. Birrell to go home. When I entered the parlour Lupin was kicking his legs in the
     air, and roaring with laughter.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic119"/>


    <p><label>November 12, Sunday.</label>—Coming home from church Carrie and I met Lupin, Daisy
     Mutlar, and her brother. Daisy was introduced to us, and we walked home
     <pb n="120"/> together, Carrie walking on with Miss Mutlar. We asked them in for a few minutes,
     and I had a good look at my future daughter-in-law. My heart quite sank. She is a big young
     woman, and I should think at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her
     good-looking. Carrie asked her if she could come in on Wednesday next with her brother to meet
     a few friends. She replied that she would only be too pleased.</p>
    <p><label>November 13.</label>—Carrie sent out invitations to Gowing, the Cummings', to Mr. and
     Mrs. James (of Sutton), and Mr. Stillbrook. I wrote a note to Mr. Franching, of Peckham. Carrie
     said we may as well make it a nice affair, and why not ask our principal, Mr. Perkupp? I said I
     feared we were not quite grand enough for him. Carrie said there was "no offence in asking
     him." I said: "Certainly not," and I wrote Lim a letter. Carrie confessed she was a little
     disappointed with Daisy Mutlar's appearance, but thought she seemed a nice girl.</p>
    <p><label>November 14.</label>—Everybody so far has accepted for our quite grand little party
     for to-morrow. Mr. Perkupp, in a nice letter, which I shall keep, wrote that he was dining in
     Kensington, but if he could
     <pb n="121"/> get away, he would come up to Holloway for an hour. Carrie was busy all day,
     making little cakes and open jam puffs and jellies. She said she felt quite nervous about her
     responsi­bilities to-morrow evening. We decided to have some light things on the table, such as
     sandwiches, cold chicken and ham, and some sweets, and on the sideboard a nice piece of cold
     beef and a Paysandu tongue for the more hungry ones to peg into if they liked.</p>
    <p>Gowing called to know if he was to put on "swallow-tails" to-morrow. Carrie said he had
     better dress, especially as Mr. Franching was coming, and there was a possibility of Mr.
     Perkupp also putting in an appearance.</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "Oh, I only wanted to know; for I have not worn my dress-coat for some time, and
     I must send it to have the creases pressed out."</p>
    <p>After Gowing left, Lupin came in, and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar, carped at and
     criticised the arrangements, and, in fact, disapproved of everything, including our having
     asked our old friend Cummings, who, he said, would look in evening-dress like a green-grocer
     engaged to wait, and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one.</p>
    <p>I fairly lost my temper, and I said: "Lupin, allow me to tell you Miss Daisy Mutlar is not
     the Queen of
     <pb n="122"/> England. I gave you credit for more wisdom than to allow yourself to be inveigled
     into an engagement with a woman considerably older than yourself. I advise you to think of
     earning your living before entangling yourself with a wife whom you will have to support, and,
     in all probability, her brother also, who appeared to be nothing but a loafer."</p>
    <p>Instead of receiving this advice in a sensible manner, Lupin jumped up and said: "If you
     insult the lady I am engaged to, you insult me. I will leave the house and never darken your
     doors again."</p>
    <p>He went out of the house, slamming the hall-door. But it was all right. He came back to
     supper, and we played <hi>Bézique</hi> till nearly twelve o'clock.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
    <p>Our first important Party. Old Friends and New Friends. Gowing is a little annoying; but his
     friend, Mr. Stillbrook, turns out to be quite amusing. Inopportune arrival of Mr. Perkupp, but
     he is most kind and complimentary. Party a great success.</p>
    <p><label>November 15</label>—A red-letter day. Our first important party since we have been in
     this house. I got home early from the City. Lupin insisted on having a hired waiter, and stood
     a half-dozen of champagne. I think this an unnecessary expense, but Lupin said he had had a
     piece of luck, having made three pounds out of a private deal in the City. I hope he won't
     gamble in his new situation. The supper-room looked so nice, and Carrie truly said: "We need
     not be ashamed of its being seen by Mr. Perkupp, should he honour us by coming."</p>
    <p/>
    <p>I dressed early in case people should arrive punctually at eight o'clock, and was much vexed
     to
     <pb n="126"/> find my new dress trousers much too short. Lupin, who is getting beyond his
     position, found fault with my wearing ordinary boots instead of dress boots.</p>
    <p>I replied, satirically: "My dear son, I have lived to be above that sort of thing."</p>
    <p>Lupin burst out laughing, and said: "A man generally was above his boots."</p>
    <p>This may be funny, or it may <hi>not</hi>; but I was gratified to find he had not discovered
     the coral had come off one of my studs. Carrie looked a picture, wearing the dress she wore at
     the Mansion House. The arrangement of the drawing-room was excellent. Carrie had hung muslin
     curtains over the folding-doors, and also over one of the entrances, for we had removed the
     door from its hinges.</p>
    <p>Mr. Peters, the waiter, arrived in good time, and I gave him strict orders not to open
     another bottle of champagne until the previous one was empty. Carrie arranged for some sherry
     and port wine to be placed on the drawing-room sideboard, with some glasses. By-the-by, our new
     enlarged and tinted photographs look very nice on the walls, especially as Carrie has arranged
     some Liberty silk bows on the four corners of them.</p>
    <p>The first arrival was Gowing, who, with his usual
     <pb n="127"/> taste, greeted me with: "Hulloh, Pooter, why your trousers are too short!"</p>
    <p>I simply said: "Very likely, and you will find my temper '<hi>short</hi>' also."</p>
    <p>He said: "That won't make your trousers longer, Juggins. You should get your missus to put a
     flounce on them."</p>
    <p>I wonder I waste my time entering his insulting observations in my diary.</p>
    <p>The next arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Cummings. The former said: "As you didn't say anything
     about dress, I have come 'half dress.'" He had on a black frock-coat and white tie. The James',
     Mr. Merton, and Mr. Stillbrook arrived, but Lupin was restless and unbearable till his Daisy
     Mutlar and Frank arrived.</p>
    <p>Carrie and I were rather startled at Daisy's appearance. She had a bright-crimson dress on,
     cut very low in the neck. I do not think such a style modest. She ought to have taken a lesson
     from Carrie, and covered her shoulders with a little lace. Mr. Nackles, Mr. Sprice-Hogg and his
     four daughters came; so did Franching, and one or two of Lupin's new friends, members of the
     "Holloway Comedians." Some of these seemed rather theatrical in their manner, especially one,
     <pb n="128"/> who was posing all the evening, and leant on our little round table and cracked
     it. Lupin called him "our Henry," and said he was "our lead at the H. C.'s," and was quite as
     good in that department as Harry Mutlar was as the low-comedy merchant. All this is Greek to
     me.</p>
    <p>We had some music, and Lupin, who never left Daisy's side for a moment, raved over her
     singing of a song, called "Some Day." It seemed a pretty song, but she made such grimaces, and
     sang, to my mind, so out of tune, I would not have asked her to sing again; but Lupin made her
     sing four songs right off, one after the other.</p>
    <p>At ten o'clock we went down to supper, and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would
     have thought they had not had a meal for a month. I told Carrie to keep something back in case
     Mr. Perkupp should come by mere chance. Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler
     of champagne, and drinking it straight off. He repeated this action, and made me fear our
     half-dozen of champagne would not last out. I tried to keep a bottle back, but Lupin got hold
     of it, and took it to the side-table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar.</p>
    <p>We went upstairs, and the young fellows began
     <pb n="129"/> skylarking. Carrie put a stop to that at once. Stillbrook amused us with a song,
     "What have you done with your Cousin John?" I did not notice that Lupin and Frank had
     disappeared. I asked Mr. Watson, one of the Holloways, where they were, and he said: "It's a
     case of 'Oh, what a surprise!'"</p>
    <p>We were directed to form a circle-which we did. Watson then said: "I have much pleasure in
     introducing the celebrated Blondin Donkey." Frank and Lupin then bounded into the room. Lupin
     had whitened his face like a clown, and Frank had tied round his waist a large hearthrug. He
     was supposed to be the donkey, and he looked it. They indulged in a very noisy pantomime, and
     we were all shrieking with laughter.</p>
    <p>I turned round suddenly, and then I saw Mr. Perkupp standing half-way in the door, he having
     arrived without our knowing it. I beckoned to Carrie, and we went up to him at once. He would
     not come right into the room. I apologised for the foolery, but Mr. Perkupp said: "Oh, it seems
     amusing." I could see he was not a bit amused.</p>
    <p>Carrie and I took him downstairs, but the table was a wreck. There was not a glass of
     champagne left-not even a sandwich. Mr. Perkupp said he required nothing, but would like a
     glass of
     <pb n="130"/> seltzer or soda water. The last syphon was empty. Carrie said: "We have plenty of
     port wine left." Mr. Perkupp said, with a smile: "No, thank you. I really require nothing, but
     I am most pleased to see you and your husband in your own home. Good-night, Mrs. Pooter-you
     will excuse my very short stay, I know." I went with him to his carriage, and he said: "Don't
     trouble to come to the office till twelve to-morrow."</p>
    <p>I felt despondent as I went back to the house, and I told Carrie I thought the party was a
     failure. Carrie said it was a great success, and I was only tired, and insisted on my having
     some port myself. I drank two glasses, and felt much better, and we went into the drawing-room,
     where they had commenced dancing. Carrie and I had a little dance, which I said reminded me of
     old days. She said I was a spooney old thing.</p>

    <p>Reflections. I make another Good Joke. Am annoyed at the constant serving-up of the
     "Blanc-Mange." Lupin expresses his opinion of Weddings. Lupin falls out with Daisy Mutlar.</p>
    <p><label>November 16</label>—Woke about twenty times during the night, with terrible thirst.
     Finished off all the water in the bottle, as well as half that in the jug. Kept dreaming, also,
     that last night's party was a failure, and that a lot of low people came without invitation,
     and kept chaffing and throwing things at Mr. Perkupp, till at last I was obliged to hide him in
     the box-room (which we had just discovered), with a bath-towel over him. It seems absurd now,
     but it was painfully real in the dream. I had the same dream about a dozen times.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="punch95-309"/>


    <p>Carrie annoyed me by saying: "You know champagne never agrees with you." I told her I had
     only a couple of glasses of it, having kept myself entirely to port. I added that good
     champagne hurt nobody,
     <pb n="134"/> and Lupin told me he had only got it from a traveller as a favour, as that
     particular brand had been entirely bought up by a West-End club.</p>
    <p>I think I ate too heartily of the "side dishes," as the waiter called them. I said to Carrie:
     "I wish I had put those 'side dishes' <hi>aside</hi>." I repeated this, but Carrie was busy,
     packing up the teaspoons we had borrowed of Mrs. Cummings for the party. It was just half-past
     eleven, and I was starting for the office, when Lupin appeared, with a yellow complexion, and
     said: "Hulloh, Guv., what priced head have you this morning?" I told him he might just as well
     speak to me in Dutch. He added: "When I woke this morning, my head was as big as Baldwin's
     balloon." On the spur of the moment I said the cleverest thing I think I have ever said; viz.:
     "Perhaps that accounts for the para<hi>shooting</hi> pains." We all three roared.</p>
    <p><label>November 17.</label>—Still feel tired and headachy! In the evening Gowing called, and
     was full of praise about our party last Wednesday. He said everything was done beautifully, and
     he enjoyed himself enormously. Gowing can be a very nice fellow when he likes, but you never
     know how long it will last.
     <pb n="135"/> For instance, he stopped to supper, and seeing some <hi>blanc-mange</hi> on the
     table, shouted out, while the servant was in the room: "Hulloh! The remains of Wednesday?"</p>
    <p><label>November 18.</label>—Woke up quite fresh after a good night's rest, and feel quite
     myself again. I am satisfied a life of going-out and Society is not a life for me; we therefore
     declined the invitation which we received this morning to Miss Bird's wedding. We only met her
     twice at Mrs. James', and it means a present. Lupin said: "I am with you for once. To my mind a
     wedding's a very poor play. There are only two parts in it-the bride and bridegroom. The best
     man is only a walking gentleman. With the exception of a crying father and a snivelling mother,
     the rest are <hi>supers</hi> who have to dress well and have to <hi>pay</hi> for their
     insignificant parts in the shape of costly presents." I did not care for the theatrical slang,
     but thought it clever, though disrespectful.</p>
    <p>I told Sarah not to bring up the <hi>blanc-mange</hi> again for breakfast. It seems to have
     been placed on our table at every meal since Wednesday. Cummings came round in the evening, and
     congratulated us on the success of our party. He said
     <pb n="136"/> it was the best party he had been to for many a year; but he wished we had let
     him know it was full dress, as he would have turned up in his swallow-tails. We sat down to a
     quiet game of dominoes, and were interrupted by the noisy entrance of Lupin and Frank Mutlar.
     Cummings and I asked them to join us. Lupin said he did not care for dominoes, and suggested a
     game of "Spoof." On my asking if it required counters, Frank and Lupin in measured time said:
     "One, two, three; go! Have you an estate in Greenland?" It was simply Greek to me, but it
     appears it is one of the customs of the "Holloway Comedians" to do this when a member displays
     ignorance.</p>
    <p>In spite of my instructions, that <hi>blanc-mange</hi> was brought up again for supper. To
     make matters worse, there had been an attempt to disguise it, by placing it in a glass dish
     with jam round it. Carrie asked Lupin if he would have some, and he replied: "No second-hand
     goods for me, thank you." I told Carrie, when we were alone, if that <hi>blanc-mange</hi> were
     placed on the table again, I should walk out of the house.</p>
    <p><label>November 19, Sunday.</label>—A delightfully quiet day. In the afternoon Lupin was off
     to spend the
     <pb n="137"/> rest of the day with the Mutlars. He departed in the best of spirits, and Carrie
     said: "Well, one advantage of Lupin's engagement with Daisy is that the boy seems happy all day
     long. That quite reconciles me to what I must confess seems an imprudent engagement."</p>
    <p>Carrie and I talked the matter over during the evening, and agreed that it did not always
     follow that an early engagement meant an unhappy marriage. Dear Carrie reminded me that we
     married early, and, with the exception of a few trivial misunder­standings, we had never had a
     really serious word. I could not help thinking (as I told her) that half the pleasures of life
     were derived from the little struggles and small privations that one had to endure at the
     beginning of one's married life. Such struggles were generally occasioned by want of means, and
     often helped to make loving couples stand together all the firmer.</p>
    <p>Carrie said I had expressed myself wonderfully well, and that I was quite a philosopher.</p>
    <p>We are all vain at times, and I must confess I felt flattered by Carrie's little compliment.
     I don't pretend to be able to express myself in fine language, but I feel I have the power of
     expressing my thoughts with simplicity and lucidness.</p>
    <pb n="138"/>
    <p>About nine o'clock, to our surprise, Lupin entered, with a wild, reckless look, and in a
     hollow voice, which I must say seemed rather theatrical, said: "Have you any brandy?" I said:
     "No; but here is some whisky." Lupin drank off nearly a wineglassful without water, to my
     horror.</p>
    <p>We all three sat reading in silence till ten, when Carrie and I rose to go to bed. Carrie
     said to Lupin: "I hope Daisy is well?"</p>
    <p>Lupin, with a forced careless air that he must have picked up from the "Holloway Comedians,"
     replied: "Oh, Daisy? You mean Miss Mutlar. I don't know whether she is well or not, but please
      <hi>never to mention her name again in my presence</hi>."</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
    <p>We have a dose of Irving imitations. Make the acquaintance of a Mr. Padge. Don't care for
     him. Mr. Burwin-Fosselton becomes a nuisance.</p>
    <p><label>November 20</label>—Have seen nothing of Lupin the whole day. Bought a cheap
     address-book. I spent the evening copying in the names and addresses of my friends and
     acquaintances. Left out the Mutlars of course.</p>
    <p><label>November 21.</label>—Lupin turned up for a few minutes in the evening. He asked for a
     drop of brandy with a sort of careless look, which to my mind was theatrical and quite
     ineffective. I said: "My boy, I have none, and I don't think I should give it you if I had."
     Lupin said: "I'll go where I can get some," and walked out of the house. Carrie took the boy's
     part, and the rest of the evening was spent in a disagreeable discussion, in which the
     <pb n="142"/> words "Daisy" and "Mutlar" must have occurred a thousand times.</p>
    <p><label>November 22.</label>—Gowing and Cummings dropped in during the evening. Lupin also
     came in, bringing his friend Mr. Burwin-Fosselton-one of the "Holloway Comedians"-who was at
     our party the other night, and who cracked our little round table. Happy to say Daisy Mutlar
     was never referred to. The conversation was almost entirely monopolised by the young fellow
     Fosselton, who not only looked rather like Mr. Irving, but seemed to imagine that he
      <hi>was</hi> the celebrated actor. I must say he gave some capital imitations of him. As he
     showed no signs of moving at supper time, I said: "If you like to stay, Mr. Fosselton, for our
     usual crust-pray do." He replied: "Oh! thanks; but please call me Burwin-Fosselton. It is a
     double name. There are lots of Fosseltons, but please call me Burwin-Fosselton."</p>
    <p>He began doing the Irving business all through supper. He sank so low down in his chair that
     his chin was almost on a level with the table, and twice he kicked Carrie under the table,
     upset his wine, and flashed a knife uncomfortably near Gowing's face. After supper he kept
     stretching out his legs on the
     <pb n="144"/> fender, indulging in scraps of quotations from plays which were Greek to me, and
     more than once knocked over the fire-irons, making a hideous row-poor Carrie already having a
     bad headache.</p>
    <pb n="[143]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic143"/>


    <p>When he went, he said, to our surprise: "I will come to-morrow and bring my Irving make-up."
     Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and would come too. I could not help
     thinking they might as well give a party at my house while they are about it. However, as
     Carrie sensibly said: "Do anything, dear, to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar business."</p>
    <p><label>November 23.</label>—In the evening, Cummings came early. Gowing came a little later
     and brought, without asking permission, a fat and, I think, very vulgar-looking man named
     Padge, who appeared to be all moustache. Gowing never attempted any apology to either of us,
     but said Padge wanted to see the Irving business, to which Padge said: "That's right," and that
     is about all he <hi>did</hi> say during the entire evening. Lupin came in and seemed in much
     better spirits. He had prepared a bit of a surprise. Mr. Burwin-Fosselton had come in with him,
     but had gone upstairs to get ready. In half-an-hour Lupin retired from the parlour, and
     <pb n="146"/> returning in a few minutes, announced "Mr. Henry Irving."</p>
    <pb n="[145]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic145"/>


    <p>I must say we were all astounded. I never saw such a resemblance. It was astonishing. The
     only person who did not appear interested was the man Padge, who had got the best arm-chair,
     and was puffing away at a foul pipe into the fireplace. After some little time I said: "Why do
     actors always wear their hair so long?" Carrie in a moment said, "Mr. Hare doesn't wear long
      <hi>hair</hi>." How we laughed except Mr. Fosselton, who said, in a rather patronising kind of
     way, "The joke, Mrs. Pooter, is extremely appropriate, if not altogether new." Thinking this
     rather a snub, I said: "Mr. Fosselton, I fancy --" He interrupted me by saying: "Mr.
      <hi>Burwin</hi>—Fosselton, if you please," which made me quite forget what I was going to say
     to him. During the supper Mr. Burwin-Fosselton again monopolised the conversation with his
     Irving talk, and both Carrie and I came to the conclusion one can have even too much imitation
     of Irving. After supper, Mr. Burwin-Fosselton got a little too boisterous over his Irving
     imitation, and suddenly seizing Gowing by the collar of his coat, dug his thumb-nail,
     accidentally of course, into Gowing's neck and took a piece of flesh out. Gowing
     <pb n="148"/> was rightly annoyed, but that man Padge, who having declined our modest supper in
     order that he should not lose his comfortable chair, burst into an uncontrollable fit of
     laughter at the little misadventure. I was so annoyed at the conduct of Padge, I said: "I
     suppose you would have laughed if he had poked Mr. Gowing's eye out?" to which Padge replied:
     "That's right," and laughed more than ever. I think perhaps the greatest surprise was, when we
     broke up, for Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said: "Good-night, Mr. Pooter. I'm glad you like the
     imitation, I'll bring <hi>the other make-up to-morrow night</hi>."</p>
    <pb n="[147]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic147"/>


    <p><label>November 24.</label>—I went to town without a pocket-handkerchief. This is the second
     time I have done this during the last week. I must be losing my memory. Had it not been for
     this Daisy Mutlar business, I would have written to Mr. Burwin-Fosselton and told him I should
     be out this evening, but I fancy he is the sort of young man who would come all the same.</p>
    <p>Dear old Cummings came in the evening; but Gowing sent round a little note, saying he hoped I
     would excuse his not turning up, which rather amused me. He added that his neck was still
     <pb n="149"/> painful. Of course, Burwin-Fosselton came, but Lupin never turned up, and imagine
     my utter disgust when that man Padge actually came again, and not even accompanied by Gowing. I
     was exasperated, and said: "Mr. Padge, this is a <hi>surprise</hi>." Dear Carrie fearing
     unpleasantness said, "Oh! I suppose Mr. Padge has only come to see the other Irving make-up."
     Mr. Padge said, "That's right," and took the best chair again, from which he never moved the
     whole evening.</p>
    <p>My only consolation is, he takes no supper, so he is not an expensive guest, but I shall
     speak to Gowing about the matter. The Irving imitations and conversations occupied the whole
     evening, till I was sick of it. Once we had a rather heated discussion, which was commenced by
     Cummings saying that it appeared to him that Mr. Burwin-Fosselton was not only <hi>like</hi>
     Mr. Irving, but was in his judgment every way as <hi>good</hi> or even <hi>better</hi>. I
     ventured to remark that after all it was but an imitation of an original.</p>
    <p>Cummings said surely some imitations were better than the originals. I made what I considered
     a clever remark: "Without an original there can be no imitation." Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said
     quite impertinently: "Don't discuss me in
     <pb n="150"/> my presence, if you please; and Mr. Pooter, I should advise you to talk about
     what you understand;" to which that cad Padge replied: "That's right." Dear Carrie saved the
     whole thing by suddenly saying: "I'll be Ellen Terry." Dear Carrie's imitation wasn't a bit
     liked, but she was so spontaneous and so funny that the disagreeable discussion passed off.
     When they left, I very pointedly said to Mr. Burwin-Fosselton and Mr. Padge that we should be
     engaged to-morrow evening.</p>
    <p><label>November 25.</label>—Had a long letter from Mr. Fosselton respecting last night's
     Irving discussion. I was very angry, and I wrote and said I knew little or nothing about stage
     matters, was not in the least interested in them and positively declined to be drawn into a
     discussion on the subject, even at the risk of its leading to a breach of friendship. I never
     wrote a more determined letter.</p>
    <p>On returning home at the usual early hour on Saturday afternoon I met near the Archway Daisy
     Mutlar. My heart gave a leap. I bowed rather stiffly, but she affected not to have seen me.
     Very much annoyed in the evening by the laundress sending home an odd sock. Sarah
     <pb n="151"/> said she sent two pairs and the laundress declared only a pair and a half were
     sent. I spoke to Carrie about it, but she rather testily replied: "I am tired of speaking to
     her; you had better go and speak to her yourself. She is outside." I did so, but the laundress
     declared that only an odd sock was sent.</p>
    <p>Gowing passed into the passage at this time and was rude enough to listen to the
     conversation, and interrupting, said, "Don't waste the odd sock old man; do an act of charity
     and give it to some poor man with only one leg." The laundress giggled like an idiot. I was
     disgusted and walked upstairs for the purpose of pinning down my collar, as the button had come
     off the back of my shirt.</p>
    <p>When I returned to the parlour. Gowing was retailing his idiotic joke about the odd sock, and
     Carrie was roaring with laughter. I suppose I am losing my sense of humour. I spoke my mind
     pretty freely about Padge. Gowing said he had met him only once before that evening. He had
     been introduced by a friend, and as he (Padge) had "stood" a good dinner. Gowing wished to show
     him some little return. Upon my word. Gowing's coolness surpasses all belief. Lupin came in
     before I could reply, and Gowing unfortunately enquired
     <pb n="152"/> after Daisy Mutlar. Lupin shouted: "Mind your own business, sir!" and bounced out
     of the room, slamming the door. The remainder of the night was Daisy Mutlar-Daisy Mutlar-Daisy
     Mutlar. Oh dear!</p>
    <p><label>November 26, Sunday.</label>—The curate preached a very good sermon to-day-very good
     indeed. His appearance is never so impressive as our dear old vicar's, but I am bound to say
     his sermons are much more impressive. A rather annoying incident occurred, of which I must make
     mention. Mrs. Fernlosse, who is quite a grand lady, living in one of those large houses in the
     Camden Road, stopped to speak to me after church, when we were all coming out. I must say I
     felt flattered, for she is thought a good deal of. I suppose she knew me through seeing me so
     often take round the plate, especially as she always occupies the corner seat of the pew. She
     is a very influential lady, and may have had something of the utmost importance to say, but,
     unfortunately, as she commenced to speak a strong gust of wind came and blew my hat off into
     the middle of the road.</p>
    <p>I had to run after it, and had the greatest difficulty in recovering it. When I had succeeded
     in
     <pb n="153"/> doing, so I found Mrs. Fernlosse had walked on with some swell friends, and I
     felt I could not well approach her now, especially as my hat was smothered with mud. I cannot
     say how disappointed I felt.</p>
    <p>In the evening (<hi>Sunday</hi> evening of all others) I found an impertinent note from Mr.
     Burwin-Fosselton, which ran as follows:</p>
    <p>"<label>Dear Mr. Pooter,</label>—Although your junior by perhaps some twenty or thirty
     years-which is sufficient reason that you ought to have a longer record of the things and ways
     in this miniature of a planet-I feel it is just within the bounds of possibility that the
     wheels of <hi>your</hi> life don't travel so quickly round as those of the humble writer of
     these lines. The dandy horse of past days has been known to overtake the <hi>slow
     coach</hi>.</p>
    <p>"Do I make myself understood?</p>
    <p>"Very well, then! Permit me, Mr. Pooter, to advise you to accept the <foreign>verb.
      sap.</foreign> Acknowledge your defeat, and take your whipping gracefully: for remember you
     threw down the glove, and I cannot claim to be either mentally or physically a
     <hi>coward!</hi></p>
    <p>"<foreign>Revenons à nos moutons.</foreign></p>
    <p>"Our lives run in different grooves. I live for MY ART-THE STAGE. Your life is devoted to
     commercial pursuits-'A Life among Ledgers.' My books are of different metal. Your life in the
     City is honourable, I admit. <hi>But how different!</hi> Cannot even you see the ocean between
     us? A channel that prevents the meeting of our brains in harmonious accord. Ah! But
      <foreign>chaçun á son gout</foreign>.</p>
    <p>"I have registered a vow to mount the steps of fame. I may crawl, I may slip, I may even
     falter (we all are weak), but <hi>reach the top rung of the ladder I will!!!</hi> When there,
     <pb n="154"/> my voice shall be heard, for I will shout to the multitudes below:
      '<foreign>Vici!</foreign>' For the present I am only an amateur, and my work is unknown,
     forsooth, save to a party of friends, with here and there an enemy.</p>
    <p>"But, Mr. Pooter, let me ask you, 'What is the difference between the amateur and the
     professional?'</p>
    <p>"None!!!</p>
    <p>"Stay! Yes, there is a difference. One is <hi>paid</hi> for doing what the other does as
     skilfully for <hi>nothing!</hi></p>
    <p>"But <hi>I</hi> will be <hi>paid</hi>, too! For <hi>I</hi>, contrary to the wishes of my
     family and friends, have at last elected to adopt the stage as <hi>my</hi> profession. And when
     the <hi>farce</hi> craze is over-<hi>and, mark you, that will be soon</hi>—I will make my power
     known; for I feel-pardon my apparent conceit-that there is no living man who can play the
     hump-backed Richard as I <hi>feel</hi> and know I can.</p>
    <p>"And <hi>you</hi> will be the first to come round and bend your head in submission. There are
     many matters you may understand, but knowledge of the fine art of acting is to you an
      <hi>unknown quantity</hi>.</p>
    <p>"Pray let this discussion cease with this letter. <foreign>Vale!</foreign></p>
    <p>"Yours truly,</p>
    <p>"Burwin-Fosselton."</p>
    <p>I was disgusted. When Lupin came in, I handed him this impertinent letter, and said: "My boy,
     in that letter you can see the true character of your friend."</p>
    <p>Lupin, to my surprise, said: "Oh yes. He showed me the letter before he sent it. I think he
     is right, and you ought to apologise."</p>

    <p>A serious discussion concerning the use and value of my diary. Lupin's opinion of 'Xmas.
     Lupin's unfortunate engagement is on again.</p>
    <p><label>December 17</label>—As I open my scribbling diary I find the words "Oxford Michaelmas
     Term ends." Why this should induce me to indulge in retrospective I don't know, but it does.
     The last few weeks of my diary are of minimum interest. The breaking-off of the engagement
     between Lupin and Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being, and Carrie a rather depressing
     companion. She was a little dull last Saturday, and I thought to cheer her up by reading some
     extracts from my diary; but she walked out of the room in the middle of the reading, without a
     word. On her return, I said: "Did my diary bore you, darling?"</p>
    <p/>
    <p>She replied, to my surprise: "I really wasn't listening, dear. I was obliged to leave to give
     instructions to the laundress. In consequence of some stuff she puts in the water, two more of
     <pb n="158"/> Lupin's coloured shirts have run; and he says he won't wear them."</p>
    <p>I said: "Everything is Lupin. It's all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin. There was not a single button on
      <hi>my</hi> shirt yesterday, but <hi>I</hi> made no complaint."</p>
    <p>Carrie simply replied: "You should do as all other men do, and wear studs. In fact, I never
     saw anyone but you wear buttons on the shirt-fronts."</p>
    <p>I said: "I certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on."</p>
    <p>Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening, and Cummings
     never does. I fear they don't get on well with Lupin.</p>
    <p><label>December 18.</label>—Yesterday I was in a retrospective vein-to-day it is
      <hi>prospective</hi>. I see nothing but clouds, clouds, clouds. Lupin is perfectly intolerable
     over the Daisy Mutlar business. He won't say what is the cause of the breach. He is evidently
     condemning her conduct, and yet, if we venture to agree with him, says he won't hear a word
     against her. So what is one to do? Another thing which is disappointing to me is, that Carrie
     and Lupin take no interest whatever in my diary.</p>
    <p>I broached the subject at the breakfast-table to-day. I said: "I was in hopes that, if
     anything
     <pb n="159"/> ever happened to me, the diary would be an endless source of pleasure to you
     both; to say nothing of the chance of the remuneration which may accrue from its being
     published."</p>
    <p>Both Carrie and Lupin burst out laughing. Carrie was sorry for this, I could see, for she
     said: "I did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie; but <hi>truly</hi> I do not think your diary
     would sufficiently interest the public to be taken up by a publisher."</p>
    <p>I replied: "I am sure it would prove quite as interesting as some of the ridiculous
     reminiscences that have been published lately. Besides, it's the diary that makes the man.
     Where would Evelyn and Pepys have been if it had not been for their diaries?"</p>
    <p>Carrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin, in a jeering tone, said: "If it had been
     written on larger paper, Guv., we might get a fair price from a butterman for it."</p>
    <p>As I am in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see the end of my diary.</p>
    <p><label>December 19.</label>—The annual invitation came to spend Christmas with Carrie's
     mother-the usual family festive gathering to which we always look forward. Lupin declined to
     go. I was astounded, and expressed my surprise and disgust. Lupin then
     <pb n="160"/> obliged us with the following Radical speech: "I hate a family gathering at
     Christmas. What does it mean? Why someone says: 'Ah! we miss poor Uncle James, who was here
     last year,' and we all begin to snivel. Someone else says: 'It's two years since poor Aunt Liz
     used to sit in that corner.' Then we all begin to snivel again. Then another gloomy relation
     says: 'Ah! I wonder whose turn it will be next?' Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat
     and drink too much; and they don't discover until <hi>I</hi> get up that we have been seated
     thirteen at dinner."</p>
    <p><label>December 20.</label>—Went to Smirksons', the drapers, in the Strand, who this year
     have turned out everything in the shop and devoted the whole place to the sale of Christmas
     cards. Shop crowded with people, who seemed to take up the cards rather roughly, and, after a
     hurried glance at them, throw them down again. I remarked to one of the young persons serving,
     that carelessness appeared to be a disease with some purchasers. The observation was scarcely
     out of my mouth, when my thick coat-sleeve caught against a large pile of expensive cards in
     boxes one on top of the other, and threw them down. The manager came forward, looking very
     <pb n="161"/> much annoyed, and picking up several cards from the ground, said to one of the
     assistants, with a palpable side-glance at me: "Put these amongst the sixpenny goods; they
     can't be sold for a shilling now." The result was, I felt it my duty to buy some of these
     damaged cards.</p>
    <p>I had to buy more and pay more than I intended. Unfortunately I did not examine them all, and
     when I got home I discovered a vulgar card with a picture of a fat nurse with two babies, one
     black and the other white, and the words: "We wish Pa a Merry Christmas." I tore up the card
     and threw it away. Carrie said the great disadvantage of going out in Society and increasing
     the number of our friends was, that we should have to send out nearly two dozen cards this
     year.</p>
    <p><label>December 21.</label>—To save the postmen a miserable Christmas, we follow the example
     of all unselfish people, and send out our cards early. Most of the cards had finger-marks,
     which I did not notice at night. I shall buy all future cards in the daytime. Lupin (who, ever
     since he has had the appointment with a stock and share broker, does not seem over-scrupulous
     in his dealings) told me never to rub out
     <pb n="162"/> the pencilled price on the backs of the cards. I asked him why. Lupin said:
     "Suppose your card is marked 9d. Well, all you have to do is to pencil a 3-and a long
     down-stroke after it-in front of the ninepence, and people will think you have given five times
     the price for it."</p>
    <p>In the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded him that behind the clouds the sun
     was shining. He said: "Ugh! it never shines on me." I said: "Stop, Lupin, my boy; you are
     worried about Daisy Mutlar. Don't think of her any more. You ought to congratulate yourself on
     having got off a very bad bargain. Her notions are far too grand for our simple tastes." He
     jumped up and said: "I won't allow one word to be uttered against her. She's worth the whole
     bunch of your friends put together, that inflated, sloping-head of a Perkupp included." I left
     the room with silent dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.</p>
    <p><label>December 23.</label>—I exchanged no words with Lupin in the morning; but as he seemed
     to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured to ask him where he intended to spend his
     Christmas. He replied: "Oh, most likely at the Mutlars'."</p>
    <pb n="163-164"/>
    <p>In wonderment, I said: "What! after your engagement has been broken off?"</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Who said it is off?"</p>
    <p>I said: "You have given us both to understand--"</p>
    <p>He interrupted me by saying: "Well, never mind what I said. <hi>It is on
     again-there!</hi>"</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
    <p>I receive an insulting Christmas card. We spend a pleasant Christmas at Carrie's mother's. A
     Mr. Moss is rather too free. A boisterous evenings during which I am struck in the dark. I
     receive an extra­ordinary letter from Mr. Mutlar, senior, respecting Lupin. We miss drinking
     out the Old Year.</p>
    <p><label>December 24th.</label>—I am a poor man, but I would gladly give ten shillings to find
     out who sent me the insulting Christmas card I received this morning. I never insult people;
     why should they insult me? The worst part of the transaction is, that I find myself suspecting
     all my friends. The handwriting on the envelope is evidently disguised, being written sloping
     the wrong way. I cannot think either Gowing or Cummings would do such a mean thing. Lupin
     denied all knowledge of it, and I believe him; although I disapprove of his laughing and
     sympathising with the offender. Mr. Franching
     <pb n="168"/> would be above such an act; and I don't think any of the Mutlars would descend to
     such a course. I wonder if Pitt, that impudent clerk at the office, did it? Or Mrs. Birrell,
     the charwoman, or Burwin-Fosselton? The writing is too good for the former.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><label>Christmas Day.</label>—We caught the 10.20 train at Paddington, and spent a pleasant
     day at Carrie's mother's. The country was quite nice and pleasant, although the roads were
     sloppy. We dined in the middle of the day, just ten of us, and talked over old times. If
     everybody had a nice, <hi>un</hi>interfering mother-in-law, such as I have, what a deal of
     happiness there would be in the world. Being all in good spirits, I proposed her health; and I
     made, I think, a very good speech.</p>
    <p>I concluded, rather neatly, by saying: "On an occasion like this-whether relatives, friends,
     or acquaintances,-we are all inspired with good feelings towards each other. We are of one
     mind, and think only of love and friendship. Those who have quarrelled with absent friends
     should kiss and make it up. Those who happily have <hi>not</hi> fallen out, can kiss all the
     same."</p>
    <p>I saw the tears in the eyes of both Carrie
     <pb n="169"/> and her mother, and must say I felt very flattered by the compliment. That dear
     old Reverend John Panzy Smith, who married us, made a most cheerful and amusing speech, and
     said he should act on my suggestion respecting the kissing. He then walked round the table and
     kissed all the ladies, including Carrie. Of course one did not object to this; but I was more
     than staggered when a young fellow named Moss, who was a stranger to me, and who had scarcely
     spoken a word through dinner, jumped up suddenly with a sprig of mistletoe, and exclaimed:
     "Hulloh! I don't see why I shouldn't be on in this scene." Before one could realise what he was
     about to do, he kissed Carrie and the rest of the ladies.</p>
    <p>Fortunately the matter was treated as a joke, and we all laughed; but it was a dangerous
     experiment, and I felt very uneasy for a moment as to the result. I subsequently referred to
     the matter to Carrie, but she said: "Oh, he's not much more than a boy." I said that he had a
     very large moustache for a boy. Carrie replied: "I didn't say he was not a nice boy."</p>
    <p><label>December 26.</label>—I did not sleep very well last night; I never do in a strange
     bed. I feel a little
     <pb n="170"/> indigestion, which one must expect at this time of the year. Carrie and I
     returned to Town in the evening. Lupin came in late. He said he enjoyed his Christmas, and
     added: "I feel as fit as a Lowther Arcade fiddle, and only require a little more 'oof' to feel
     as fit as a £500 Stradivarius." I have long since given up trying to understand Lupin's slang,
     or asking him to explain it.</p>
    <p><label>December 27.</label>—I told Lupin I was expecting Gowing and Cummings to drop in
     to-morrow evening for a quiet game. I was in hope the boy would volunteer to stay in, and help
     to amuse them. Instead of which, he said: "Oh, you had better put them off, as I have asked
     Daisy and Frank Mutlar to come." I said I could not think of doing such a thing. Lupin said:
     "Then I will send a wire, and put off Daisy." I suggested that a postcard or letter would reach
     her quite soon enough, and would not be so extravagant.</p>
    <p>Carrie, who had listened to the above conversation with apparent annoyance, directed a
     well-aimed shaft at Lupin. She said: "Lupin, why do you object to Daisy meeting your father's
     friends? Is it because they are not good enough for her, or (which is equally possible)
      <hi>she</hi> is not good enough for
     <pb n="171"/> them?" Lupin was dumbfounded, and could make no reply. When he left the room, I
     gave Carrie a kiss of approval.</p>
    <p><label>December 28.</label>—Lupin, on coming down to breakfast, said to his mother: "I have
     not put off Daisy and Frank, and should like them to join Gowing and Cummings this evening." I
     felt very pleased with the boy for this. Carrie said, in reply: "I am glad you let me know in
     time, as I can turn over the cold leg of mutton, dress it with a little parsley, and no one
     will know it has been cut." She further said she would make a few custards, and stew some
     pippins, so that they would be cold by the evening.</p>
    <p>Finding Lupin in good spirits, I asked him quietly if he really had any personal objection to
     either Gowing or Cummings. He replied: "Not in the least. I think Cummings looks rather an ass,
     but that is partly due to his patronising 'the three-and-six-one-price hat company,' and
     wearing a reach-me-down frock-coat. As for that perpetual brown velveteen jacket of
     Gowing's-why, he resembles an itinerant photographer."</p>
    <p>I said it was not the coat that made the gentleman; whereupon Lupin, with a laugh, replied:
     <pb n="172"/> "No, and it wasn't much of a gentleman who made their coats."</p>
    <p>We were rather jolly at supper, and Daisy made herself very agreeable, especially in the
     earlier part of the evening, when she sang. At supper, however, she said: "Can you make
     tee-to-tums with bread?" and she commenced rolling up pieces of bread, and twisting them round
     on the table. I felt this to be bad manners, but of course said nothing. Presently Daisy and
     Lupin, to my disgust, began throwing bread-pills at each other. Frank followed suit, and so did
     Cummings and Gowing, to my astonishment. They then commenced throwing hard pieces of crust, one
     piece catching me on the forehead, and making me blink. I said: "Steady, please; steady!" Frank
     jumped up, and said: "Tum, tum; then the band played."</p>
    <p>I did not know what this meant, but they all roared, and continued the bread-battle. Gowing
     suddenly seized all the parsley off the cold mutton, and threw it full in my face. I looked
     daggers at Gowing, who replied: "I say, it's no good trying to look indignant, with your hair
     full of parsley." I rose from the table, and insisted that a stop should be put to this foolery
     at once. Frank Mutlar shouted: "Time, gentlemen, please! time!"
     <pb n="173"/> and turned out the gas, leaving us in absolute darkness.</p>
    <p>I was feeling my way out of the room, when I suddenly received a hard intentional punch at
     the back of my head. I said, loudly: "Who did that?" There was no answer; so I repeated the
     question, with the same result. I struck a match, and lighted the gas. They were all talking
     and laughing, so I kept my own counsel; but, after they had gone, I said to Carrie: "The person
     who sent me that insulting post-card at Christmas was here to-night."</p>
    <p/>
    <p><label>December 29.</label>—I had a most vivid dream last night. I woke up, and on falling
     asleep, dreamed the same dream over again precisely. I dreamt I heard Frank Mutlar telling his
     sister that he had not only sent me the insulting Christmas card, but admitted that he was the
     one who punched my head last night in the dark. As fate would have it, Lupin, at breakfast, was
     reading extracts from a letter he had just received from Frank.</p>
    <p>I asked him to pass the envelope, that I might compare the writing. He did so, and I examined
     it by the side of the envelope containing the Christmas card. I detected a similarity in the
     <pb n="174"/> writing, in spite of the attempted disguise. I passed them on to Carrie, who
     began to laugh. I asked her what she was laughing at, and she said the card was never directed
     to me at all. It was "L. Pooter," not "C. Pooter." Lupin asked to look at the direction and the
     card, and exclaimed, with a laugh: "Oh yes, Guv., it's meant for me." I said: "Are you in the
     habit of receiving insulting Christmas cards?" He replied: "Oh yes, and of <hi>sending</hi>
     them, too."</p>
    <p>In the evening Gowing called, and said he enjoyed himself very much last night. I took the
     opportunity to confide in him, as an old friend, about the vicious punch last night. He burst
     out laughing, and said: "Oh, it was <hi>your head</hi>, was it? I know I accidentally hit
     something, but I thought it was a brick wall." I told him I felt hurt, in both senses of the
     expression.</p>
    <p><label>December 30, Sunday.</label>—Lupin spent the whole day with the Mutlars. He seemed
     rather cheerful in the evening, so I said: "I'm glad to see you so happy, Lupin." He answered:
     "Well, Daisy is a splendid girl, but I was obliged to take her old fool of a father down a peg.
     What with his meanness over his cigars, his stinginess over his drinks, his
     <pb n="175"/> farthing economy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second,
     writing to one on half-sheets of note-paper, sticking the remnant of the last cake of soap on
     to the new cake, putting two bricks on each side of the fireplace, and his general
     'outside-halfpenny-'bus-ness,' I was compelled to let him have a bit of my mind." I said:
     "Lupin, you are not much more than a boy; I hope you won't repent it."</p>
    <p><label>December 31.</label>—The last day of the Old Year. I received an extraordinary letter
     from Mr. Mutlar, senior. He writes: "Dear Sir,-For a long time past, I have had considerable
     difficulty deciding the important question, 'Who is the master of my own house? Myself, or
      <hi>your son</hi> Lupin?' Believe me, I have no prejudice one way or the other; but I have
     been most reluctantly compelled to give judgment to the effect that <hi>I</hi> am the master of
     it. Under the circumstances, it has become my duty to forbid your son to enter my house again.
     I am sorry, because it deprives me of the society of one of the most modest, unassuming, and
     gentlemanly persons I have ever had the honour of being acquainted with."</p>
    <p>I did not desire the last day to wind up disagreeably,
     <pb n="176"/> so I said nothing to either Carrie or Lupin about the letter.</p>
    <p>A most terrible fog came on, and Lupin would go out in it, but promised to be back to drink
     out the Old Year-a custom we have always observed. At a quarter to twelve Lupin had not
     returned, and the fog was fearful. As time was drawing close, I got out the spirits. Carrie and
     I deciding on whisky, I opened a fresh bottle; but Carrie said it smelt like brandy. As I knew
     it to be whisky, I said there was nothing to discuss. Carrie, evidently vexed that Lupin had
     not come in, <hi>did</hi> discuss it all the same, and wanted me to have a small wager with her
     to decide by the smell. I said I could decide it by the taste in a moment. A silly and
     unnecessary argument followed, the result of which was we suddenly saw it was a quarter-past
     twelve, and, for the first time in our married life, we missed welcoming in the New Year. Lupin
     got home at a quarter-past two, having got lost in the fog-so he said.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
    <p>Begin the year with an unexpected promotion at the office. I make two good jokes. I get an
     enormous rise in my salary. Lupin speculates successfully and starts a pony-trap. Have to speak
     to Sarah. Extraordinary conduct of Gowing's.</p>
    <p><label>January 1</label>—I had intended concluding my diary last week; but a most important
     event has happened, so I shall continue for a little while longer on the fly-leaves attached to
     the end of my last year's diary. It had just struck half-past one, and I was on the point of
     leaving the office to have my dinner, when I received a message that Mr. Perkupp desired to see
     me at once. I must confess that my heart commenced to beat and I had most serious
     misgivings.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Mr. Perkupp was in his room writing, and he said: "Take a seat, Mr. Pooter, I shall not be a
     moment."</p>
    <p>I replied: "No, thank you, sir; I'll stand."</p>
    <p>I watched the clock on the mantelpiece, and I
     <pb n="180"/> was waiting quite twenty minutes; but it seemed hours. Mr. Perkupp at last got up
     himself.</p>
    <p>I said: "I hope there is nothing wrong, sir?"</p>
    <p>He replied: "Oh dear, no! quite the reverse, I hope." What a weight off my mind! My breath
     seemed to come back again in an instant.</p>
    <p>Mr. Perkupp said: "Mr. Buckling is going to retire, and there will be some slight changes in
     the office. You have been with us nearly twenty-one years, and, in consequence of your conduct
     during that period, we intend making a special promotion in your favour. We have not quite
     decided how you will be placed; but in any case there will be a considerable increase in your
     salary, which, it is quite unnecessary for me to say, you fully deserve. I have an appointment
     at two; but you shall hear more to-morrow."</p>
    <p>He then left the room quickly, and I was not even allowed time or thought to express a single
     word of grateful thanks to him. I need not say how dear Carrie received this joyful news. With
     perfect simplicity she said: "At last we shall be able to have a chimney-glass for the back
     drawing-room, which we always wanted." I added: "Yes, and at last you shall have that little
     costume which you saw at Peter Robinson's so cheap."</p>
    <pb n="181"/>
    <p><label>January 2.</label>—I was in a great state of suspense all day at the office. I did not
     like to worry Mr. Perkupp; but as he did not send for me, and mentioned yesterday that he would
     see me again today, I thought it better, perhaps, to go to him. I knocked at his door, and on
     entering, Mr. Perkupp said: "Oh! it's you, Mr. Pooter; do you want to see me?" I said: "No,
     sir, I thought you wanted to see me?" "Oh!" he replied, "I remember. Well, I am very busy
     to-day; I will see you to-morrow."</p>
    <p><label>January 3.</label>—Still in a state of anxiety and excitement, which was not
     alleviated by ascertaining that Mr. Perkupp sent word he should not be at the office at all
     to-day. In the evening, Lupin, who was busily engaged with a paper, said suddenly to me: "Do
     you know anything about <hi>chalk pits</hi>, Guv.?" I said: "No, my boy, not that I'm aware
     of." Lupin said: "Well, I give you the tip; <hi>chalk pits</hi> are as safe as Consols, and pay
     six per cent. at par." I said a rather neat thing, viz: "They may be six per cent. at
      <hi>par</hi>, but your <hi>pa</hi> has no money to invest." Carrie and I both roared with
     laughter. Lupin did not take the slightest notice of the joke, although I purposely repeated it
     for him; but continued: "I
     <pb n="182"/> give you the tip, that's all-<hi>chalk pits!</hi>" I said another funny thing:
     "Mind you don't fall into them!" Lupin put on a supercilious smile, and said: "Bravo! Joe
     Miller."</p>
    <p><label>January 4.</label>—Mr. Perkupp sent for me and told me that my position would be that
     of one of the senior clerks. I was more than overjoyed. Mr. Perkupp added, he would let me know
     to-morrow what the salary would be. This means another day's anxiety; I don't mind, for it is
     anxiety of the right sort. That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the
     letter I received from Mr. Mutlar, senr. I broached the subject to Lupin in the evening, having
     first consulted Carrie. Lupin was riveted to the <title>Financial News</title>, as if he had
     been a born capitalist, and I said: "Pardon me a moment, Lupin, how is it you have not been to
     the Mutlars any day this week?"</p>
    <p>Lupin answered: "I told you! I cannot stand old Mutlar."</p>
    <p>I said: "Mr. Mutlar writes to me to say pretty plainly that he cannot stand you!"</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Well, I like his cheek in writing to <hi>you</hi>. I'll find out if his father
     is still alive, and I will write <hi>him</hi> a note complaining of <hi>his</hi> son, and I'll
     <pb n="183"/> state pretty clearly that his son is a blithering idiot!"</p>
    <p>I said: "Lupin, please moderate your expressions in the presence of your mother."</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "I'm very sorry, but there is no other expression one can apply to him. However,
     I'm determined not to enter his place again."</p>
    <p>I said: "You know, Lupin, he has forbidden you the house."</p>
    <p>Lupin replied: "Well, we won't split straws-it's all the same. Daisy is a trump, and will
     wait for me ten years, if necessary."</p>
    <p><label>January 5.</label>—I can scarcely write the news. Mr. Perkupp told me my salary would
     be raised £100! I stood gaping for a moment unable to realise it. I annually get £10 rise, and
     I thought it might be £15 or even £20; but £100 surpasses all belief. Carrie and I both
     rejoiced over our good fortune. Lupin came home in the evening in the utmost good spirits. I
     sent Sarah quietly round to the grocer's for a bottle of champagne, the same as we had before,
     "Jackson Frères." It was opened at supper, and I said to Lupin: "This is to celebrate some good
     news I have received to-day." Lupin replied: "Hooray, Guv.! And I have some good news, also;
     <pb n="184"/> a double event, eh?" I said: "My boy, as a result of twenty-one years' industry
     and strict attention to the interest of my superiors in office, I have been rewarded with
     promotion and a rise in salary of £100."</p>
    <p>Lupin gave three cheers, and we rapped the tables furiously, which brought in Sarah to see
     what the matter was. Lupin ordered us to "fill up" again, and addressing us upstanding, said:
     "Having been in the firm of Job Cleanands, stock and share-brokers, a few weeks, and
      <hi>not</hi> having paid particular attention to the interests of my superiors in office, my
     Guv'nor, as a reward to me, allotted me £5 worth of shares in a really good thing. The result
     is, to-day I have made £200." I said: "Lupin, you are joking." "No, Guv., it's the good old
     truth; Job Cleanands <hi>put me on to Chlorates</hi>."</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="punch96-97"/>


    <p><label>January 21.</label>—I am very much concerned at Lupin having started a pony-trap. I
     said: "Lupin, are you justified in this outrageous extravagance?" Lupin replied: "Well, one
     must get to the City somehow. I've only hired it, and can give it up any time I like." I
     repeated my question: "Are you justified in this extravagance?" He replied: "Look here, Guv.;
     excuse my saying
     <pb n="185"/> so, but you're a bit out of date. It does not pay nowadays, fiddling about over
     small things. I don't mean anything personal, Guv'nor. My boss says if I take his tip, and
     stick to big things, I can make big money!" I said I thought the very idea of speculation most
     horrifying. Lupin said: "It is not speculation, it's a dead cert." I advised him, at all
     events, not to continue the pony and cart; but he replied: "I made £200 in one day; now suppose
     I only make £200 in a month, or put it at £100 a month, which is ridiculously low-why, that is
     £1250 a year. What's a few pounds a week for a trap?"</p>
    <p>I did not pursue the subject further, beyond saying that I should feel glad when the autumn
     came, and Lupin would be of age and responsible for his own debts. He answered: "My dear Guv.,
     I promise you faithfully that I will never speculate with what I have not got. I shall only go
     on Job Cleanands' tips, and as he is in the 'know' it is pretty safe sailing." I felt somewhat
     relieved. Gowing called in the evening and, to my surprise, informed me that, as he had made
     £10 by one of Lupin's tips, he intended asking us and the Cummings' round next Saturday. Carrie
     and I said we should be delighted.</p>
    <pb n="186"/>
    <p><label>January 22.</label>—I don't generally lose my temper with servants; but I had to speak
     to Sarah rather sharply about a careless habit she has recently contracted of shaking the
     table-cloth, after removing the breakfast things, in a manner which causes all the crumbs to
     fall on the carpet, eventually to be trodden in. Sarah answered very rudely: "Oh, you are
     always complaining." I replied: "Indeed, I am not. I spoke to you last week about walking all
     over the drawing-room carpet with a piece of yellow soap on the heel of your boot." She said:
     "And you're always grumbling about your breakfast." I said: "No, I am not, but I feel perfectly
     justified in complaining that I never can get a hard-boiled egg. The moment I crack the shell
     it spurts all over the plate, and I have spoken to you at least fifty times about it." She
     began to cry and make a scene; but fortunately my 'bus came by, so I had a good excuse for
     leaving her. Gowing left a message in the evening, that we were not to forget next Saturday.
     Carrie amusingly said: "As he has never asked any friends before, we are not likely to forget
     it."</p>
    <p><label>January 23.</label>—I asked Lupin to try and change the hard brushes, he recently made
     me a present
     <pb n="187"/> of, for some softer ones, as my hairdresser tells me I ought not to brush my hair
     too much just now.</p>
    <p><label>January 24.</label>—The new chimney-glass came home for the back drawing-room. Carrie
     arranged some fans very prettily on the top and on each side. It is an immense improvement to
     the room.</p>
    <p><label>January 25.</label>—We had just finished our tea, when who should come in but
     Cummings, who has not been here for over three weeks. I noticed that he looked anything but
     well, so I said: "Well, Cummings, how are you? You look a little blue." He replied: "Yes! and I
     feel blue too." I said: "Why, what's the matter?" He said: "Oh, nothing, except that I have
     been on my back for a couple of weeks, that's all. At one time my doctor nearly gave me up, yet
     not a soul has come near me. No one has even taken the trouble to inquire whether I was alive
     or dead."</p>
    <p>I said: "This is the first I have heard of it. I have passed your house several nights, and
     presumed you had company, as the rooms were so brilliantly lighted."</p>
    <p>Cummings replied: "No! The only company
     <pb n="188"/> I have had was my wife, the doctor, and the landlady-the last-named having turned
     out a perfect trump. I wonder you did not see it in the paper. I know it was mentioned in the
      <title>Bicycle News</title>."</p>
    <p>I thought to cheer him up, and said: "Well, you are all right now?"</p>
    <p>He replied: "That's not the question. The question is whether an illness does not enable you
     to discover who are your <hi>true</hi> friends."</p>
    <p>I said such an observation was unworthy of him. To make matters worse, in came Gowing, who
     gave Cummings a violent slap on the back, and said: "Hulloh! Have you seen a ghost? You look
     scared to death, like Irving in <title>Macbeth</title>." I said: "Gently, Gowing, the poor
     fellow has been very ill." Gowing roared with laughter and said: "Yes, and you look it, too."
     Cummings quietly said: "Yes, and I feel it too-not that I suppose you care."</p>
    <p>An awkward silence followed. Gowing said: "Never mind, Cummings, you and the missis come
     round to my place to-morrow, and it will cheer you up a bit; for we'll open a bottle of
     wine."</p>
    <p><label>January 26.</label>—An extraordinary thing happened. Carrie and I went round to
     Gowing's, as arranged, at half-past seven. We knocked and rang several
     <pb n="189"/> times without getting an answer. At last the latch was drawn and the door opened
     a little way, the chain still being up. A man in shirt-sleeves put his head through and said:
     "Who is it? What do you want?" I said: "Mr. Gowing, he is expecting us." The man said (as well
     as I could hear, owing to the yapping of a little dog): "I don't think he is. Mr. Gowing is not
     at home." I said: "He will be in directly."</p>
    <p>With that observation he slammed the door, leaving Carrie and me standing on the steps with a
     cutting wind blowing round the corner.</p>
    <p>Carrie advised me to knock again. I did so, and then discovered for the first time that the
     knocker had been newly painted, and the paint had come off on my gloves-which were, in
     consequence, completely spoiled.</p>
    <p>I knocked at the door with my stick two or three times.</p>
    <p>The man opened the door, taking the chain off this time, and began abusing me. He said: "What
     do you mean by scratching the paint with your stick like that, spoiling the varnish? You ought
     to be ashamed of yourself."</p>
    <p>I said: "Pardon me, Mr. Gowing invited--"</p>
    <p>He interrupted, and said: "I don't care for Mr.
     <pb n="190"/> Gowing, or any of his friends. This is <hi>my</hi> door, not Mr. Gowing's. There
     are people here besides Mr. Gowing."</p>
    <p>The impertinence of this man was nothing. I scarcely noticed it, it was so trivial in
     comparison with the scandalous conduct of Gowing.</p>
    <p>At this moment Cummings and his wife arrived. Cummings was very lame and leaning on a stick;
     but got up the steps and asked what the matter was.</p>
    <p>The man said: "Mr. Gowing said nothing about expecting anyone. All he said was he had just
     received an invitation to Croydon, and he should not be back till Monday evening. He took his
     bag with him."</p>
    <p>With that he slammed the door again. I was too indignant with Gowing's conduct to say
     anything. Cummings looked white with rage, and as he descended the steps struck his stick
     violently on the ground and said: "Scoundrel!"</p>

    <p>Gowing explains his conduct. Lupin takes us for a drive, which we don't enjoy. Lupin
     introduces us to Mr. Murray Posh.</p>
    <p><label>February 8</label>—It does seem hard I cannot get good sausages for breakfast. They
     are either full of bread or spice, or are as red as beef. Still anxious about the £20 I
     invested last week by Lupin's advice. However, Cummings has done the same.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><label>February 9.</label>—Exactly a fortnight has passed, and I have neither seen nor heard
     from Gowing respecting his extraordinary conduct in asking us round to his house, and then
     being out. In the evening Carrie was engaged marking a half-dozen new collars I had purchased.
     I'll back Carrie's marking against anybody's. While I was drying them at the fire, and Carrie
     was rebuking me for scorching them, Cummings came in.</p>
    <p>He seemed quite well again, and chaffed us about
     <pb n="194"/> marking the collars. I asked him if he had heard from Gowing, and he replied that
     he had not. I said I should not have believed that Gowing could have acted in such an
     ungentlemanly manner. Cummings said: "You are mild in your description of him; I think he has
     acted like a cad."</p>
    <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the door opened, and Gowing, putting in his
     head, said: "May I come in?" I said: "Certainly." Carrie said very pointedly: "Well, you
      <hi>are</hi> a stranger." Gowing said: "Yes, I've been on and off to Croydon during the last
     fortnight." I could see Cummings was boiling over, and eventually he tackled Gowing very
     strongly respecting his conduct last Saturday week. Gowing appeared surprised, and said: "Why,
     I posted a letter to you in the morning announcing that the party was 'off, very much off.'" I
     said: "I never got it." Gowing, turning to Carrie, said: "I suppose letters sometimes
      <hi>miscarry</hi>, don't they, <hi>Mrs. Carrie?</hi>" Cummings sharply said: "This is not a
     time for joking. <hi>I</hi> had no notice of the party being put off." Gowing replied: "I told
     Pooter in my note to tell you, as I was in a hurry. However, I'll inquire at the post-office,
     and we must meet again at my place." I added that I hoped he would be
     <pb n="195"/> present at the next meeting. Carrie roared at this, and even Cummings could not
     help laughing.</p>
    <p><label>February 10, Sunday.</label>—Contrary to my wishes, Carrie allowed Lupin to persuade
     her to take her for a drive in the afternoon in his trap. I quite disapprove of driving on a
     Sunday, but I did not like to trust Carrie alone with Lupin, so I offered to go too. Lupin
     said: "Now, that is nice of you, Guv., but you won't mind sitting on the back-seat of the
     cart?"</p>
    <p>Lupin proceeded to put on a bright-blue coat that seemed miles too large for him. Carrie said
     it wanted taking in considerably at the back. Lupin said: "Haven't you seen a box-coat before?
     You can't drive in anything else."</p>
    <p>He may wear what he likes in the future, for I shall never drive with him again. His conduct
     was shocking. When we passed Highgate Archway, he tried to pass everything and everybody. He
     shouted to respectable people who were walking quietly in the road to get out of the way; he
     flicked at the horse of an old man who was riding, causing it to rear; and, as I had to ride
     backwards, I was compelled to face a gang of roughs in a donkey-cart, whom Lupin had chaffed,
     and who turned and followed us for nearly
     <pb n="196"/> a mile, bellowing, indulging in coarse jokes and laughter, to say nothing of
     occasionally pelting us with orange-peel.</p>
    <p>Lupin's excuse-that the Prince of Wales would have to put up with the same sort of thing if
     he drove to the Derby-was of little consolation to either Carrie or myself. Frank Mutlar called
     in the evening, and Lupin went out with him.</p>
    <p><label>February 11.</label>—Feeling a little concerned about Lupin, I mustered up courage to
     speak to Mr. Perkupp about him. Mr. Perkupp has always been most kind to me, so I told him
     everything, including yesterday's adventure. Mr. Perkupp kindly replied: "There is no necessity
     for you to be anxious, Mr. Pooter. It would be impossible for a son of such good parents to
     turn out erroneously. Remember he is young, and will soon get older. I wish we could find room
     for him in this firm." The advice of this good man takes loads off my mind. In the evening
     Lupin came in.</p>
    <p>After our little supper, he said: "My dear parents, I have some news, which I fear will
     affect you considerably." I felt a qualm come over me, and said nothing. Lupin then said: "It
     may
     <pb n="197"/> distress you-in fact, I'm sure it will-but this afternoon I have given up my pony
     and trap for ever." It may seem absurd, but I was so pleased, I immediately opened a bottle of
     port. Gowing dropped in just in time, bringing with him a large sheet, with a print of a
     tailless donkey, which he fastened against the wall. He then produced several separate tails,
     and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper
     place. My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to bed.</p>
    <p><label>February 12.</label>—In the evening I spoke to Lupin about his engagement with Daisy
     Mutlar. I asked if he had heard from her. He replied: "No; she promised that old windbag of a
     father of hers that she would not communicate with me. I see Frank Mutlar, of course; in fact,
     he said he might call again this evening." Frank called, but said he could not stop, as he had
     a friend waiting outside for him, named Murray Posh, adding he was quite a swell. Carrie asked
     Frank to bring him in.</p>
    <p>He was brought in, Gowing entering at the same time. Mr. Murray Posh was a tall, fat young
     man, and was evidently of a very nervous disposition, as he subsequently confessed he would
     never go in a
     <pb n="198"/> hansom cab, nor would he enter a four-wheeler until the driver had first got on
     the box with his reins in his hands.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n=""/>


    <p>On being introduced, Gowing, with his usual want of tact, said: "Any relation to 'Posh's
     three-shilling hats'?" Mr. Posh replied: "Yes; but please understand I don't try on hats
     myself. I take no <hi>active</hi> part in the business." I replied: "I wish I had a business
     like it." Mr. Posh seemed pleased, and gave a long but most interesting history of the
     extraordinary difficulties in the manufacture of cheap hats.</p>
    <p>Murray Posh evidently knew Daisy Mutlar very intimately from the way he was talking of her;
     and Frank said to Lupin once, laughingly: "If you don't look out, Posh will cut you out!" When
     they had all gone, I referred to this flippant conversation; and Lupin said, sarcastically: "A
     <pb n="199-200"/> man who is jealous has no respect for himself. A man who would be jealous
     of an elephant like Murray Posh could only have a contempt for himself. I know Daisy. She would
     wait ten years for me, as I said before; in fact, if necessary, <hi>she would wait twenty years
      for me</hi>."</p>

    <p>We lose money over Lupin's advice as to investments, so does Cummings. Murray Posh engaged to
     Daisy Mutlar.</p>
    <p><label>February 18</label>—Carrie has several times recently called attention to the thinness
     of my hair at the top of my head, and recommended me to get it seen to. I was this morning
     trying to look at it by the aid of a small hand-glass, when somehow my elbow caught against the
     edge of the chest of drawers and knocked the glass out of my hand and smashed it. Carrie was in
     an awful way about it, as she is rather absurdly superstitious. To make matters worse, my large
     photograph in the drawing-room fell during the night, and the glass is cracked.</p>
    <p>Carrie said: "Mark my words, Charles, some misfortune is about to happen."</p>
    <p>I said: "Nonsense, dear."</p>
    <p>In the evening Lupin arrived home early, and seemed a little agitated. I said: "What's up, my
     <pb n="204"/> boy?" He hesitated a good deal, and then said: "You know those Parachikka
     Chlorates I advised you to invest £20 in?" I replied: "Yes; they are all right, I trust?" He
     replied: "Well, no! To the surprise of everybody, they have utterly collapsed."</p>
    <p>My breath was so completely taken away, I could say nothing. Carrie looked at me, and said:
     "What did I tell you?" Lupin, after a while, said: "However, you are specially fortunate. I
     received an early tip, and sold out yours immediately, and was fortunate to get £2 for them. So
     you get something after all."</p>
    <p>I gave a sigh of relief. I said: "I was not so sanguine as to suppose, as you predicted, that
     I should get six or eight times the amount of my investment; still a profit of £2 is a good
     percentage for such a short time." Lupin said, quite irritably: "You don't understand. I sold
     your £20 shares for £2; you therefore lose £18 on the transaction, whereby Cummings and Gowing
     will lose the whole of theirs."</p>
    <p><label>February 19.</label>—Lupin, before going to town, said: "I am very sorry about those
     Parachikka Chlorates; it would not have happened if the boss, Job Cleanands, had been in town.
     Between ourselves,
     <pb n="205"/> you must not be surprised if something goes wrong at our office. Job Cleanands
     has not been seen the last few days, and it strikes me several people <hi>do</hi> want to see
     him very particularly."</p>
    <p>In the evening Lupin was just on the point of going out to avoid a collision with Gowing and
     Cummings, when the former entered the room, without knocking, but with his usual trick of
     saying, "May I come in?"</p>
    <p>He entered, and to the surprise of Lupin and myself, seemed to be in the very best of
     spirits. Neither Lupin nor I broached the subject to him, but he did so of his own accord. He
     said: "I say, those Parachikka Chlorates have gone an awful smash! You're a nice one, Master
     Lupin. How much do you lose?" Lupin, to my utter astonishment, said: "Oh! I had nothing in
     them. There was some informality in my application-I forgot to enclose the cheque, or
     something, and I didn't get any. The Guv. loses £18." I said: "I quite understood you were in
     it, or nothing would have induced me to speculate." Lupin replied: "Well, it can't be helped;
     you must go double on the next tip." Before I could reply, Gowing said: "Well, I lose nothing,
     fortunately. From what I heard, I did not quite believe in them, so I persuaded Cummings to
     <pb n="206"/> take my £15 worth, as he had more faith in them than I had."</p>
    <p>Lupin burst out laughing, and, in the most unseemly manner, said: "Alas, poor Cummings! He'll
     lose £35." At that moment there was a ring at the bell. Lupin said: "I don't want to meet
     Cummings." If he had gone out of the door he would have met him in the passage, so as quickly
     as possible Lupin opened the parlour window and got out. Gowing jumped up suddenly, exclaiming:
     "I don't want to see him either!" and, before I could say a word, he followed Lupin out of the
     window.</p>
    <p>For my own part, I was horrified to think my own son and one of my most intimate friends
     should depart from the house like a couple of interrupted burglars. Poor Cummings was very
     upset, and of course was naturally very angry both with Lupin and Gowing. I pressed him to have
     a little whisky, and he replied that he had given up whisky; but would like a little
     "Unsweetened," as he was advised it was the most healthy spirit. I had none in the house, but
     sent Sarah round to Lockwood's for some.</p>
    <p><label>February 20.</label>—The first thing that caught my
     <pb n="207"/> eye on opening the <title>Standard</title> was-"Great Failure of Stock and Share
     Dealers! Mr. Job Cleanands Absconded!" I handed it to Carrie, and she replied: "Oh! perhaps
     it's for Lupin's good. I never did think it a suitable situation for him." I thought the whole
     affair very shocking.</p>
    <p>Lupin came down to breakfast, and seeing he looked painfully distressed, I said: "We know the
     news, my dear boy, and feel very sorry for you." Lupin said: "How did you know? who told you?"
     I handed him the <title>Standard</title>. He threw the paper down, and said: "Oh, I don't care
     a button for that! I expected that, but I did not expect this." He then read a letter from
     Frank Mutlar, announcing, in a cool manner, that Daisy Mutlar is to be married next month to
     Murray Posh. I exclaimed: "Murray Posh! Is not that the very man Frank had the impudence to
     bring here last Tuesday week?" Lupin said: "Yes; the '<hi>Posh's-three-shilling-hats</hi>'
     chap."</p>
    <p>We all then ate our breakfast in dead silence.</p>
    <p>In fact, I could eat nothing. I was not only too worried, but I cannot and will not eat
     cushion of bacon. If I cannot get streaky bacon, I will do without anything.</p>
    <p>When Lupin rose to go I noticed a malicious
     <pb n="208"/> smile creep over his face. I asked him what it meant. He replied: "Oh! only a
     little consolation-still it <hi>is</hi> a consolation. I have just remembered that, by
      <hi>my</hi> advice, Mr. Murray Posh has invested £600 in Parachikka Chlorates!"</p>

    <p>Marriage of Daisy Mutlar and Murray Posh. The dream of my life realised. Mr. Perkupp takes
     Lupin into the office.</p>
    <p><label>March 20</label>—To-day being the day on which Daisy Mutlar and Mr. Murray Posh are to
     be married, Lupin has gone with a friend to spend the day at Gravesend. Lupin has been much
     cut-up over the affair, although he declares that he is glad it is off. I wish he would not go
     to so many music-halls, but one dare not say anything to him about it. At the present moment he
     irritates me by singing all over the house some nonsense about "What's the matter with
     Gladstone? He's all right! What's the matter with Lupin? He's all right!" <hi>I</hi> don't
     think either of them is. In the evening Gowing called, and the chief topic of conversation was
     Daisy's marriage to Murray Posh. I said: "I was glad the matter was at an end, as Daisy would
     only have made a fool of Lupin." Gowing, with his usual good taste, said: "Oh,
     <pb n="212"/> Master Lupin can make a fool of himself without any assistance." Carrie very
     properly resented this, and Gowing had sufficient sense to say he was sorry.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><label>March 21.</label>—To-day I should conclude my diary, for it is one of the happiest
     days of my life. My great dream of the last few weeks-in fact, of many years-has been realised.
     This morning came a letter from Mr. Perkupp, asking me to take Lupin down to the office with
     me. I went to Lupin's room; poor fellow, he seemed very pale, and said he had a bad headache.
     He had come back yesterday from Gravesend, where he spent part of the day in a small boat on
     the water, having been mad enough to neglect to take his overcoat with him. I showed him Mr.
     Perkupp's letter, and he got up as quickly as possible. I begged of him not to put on his
     fast-coloured clothes and ties, but to dress in something black or quiet-looking.</p>
    <p>Carrie was all of a tremble when she read the letter, and all she could keep on saying was:
     "Oh, I <hi>do</hi> hope it will be all right." For myself, I could scarcely eat any breakfast.
     Lupin came down dressed quietly, and looking a perfect gentleman, except that his face was
     rather
     <pb n="213"/> yellow. Carrie, by way of encouragement, said: "You do look nice, Lupin." Lupin
     replied: "Yes, it's a good make-up, isn't it? A
     regular-downright-respectable-funereal-first-class-City-firm-junior-clerk." He laughed rather
     ironically.</p>
    <p>In the hall I heard a great noise, and also Lupin shouting to Sarah to fetch down his old
     hat. I went into the passage, and found Lupin in a fury, kicking and smashing a new tall hat. I
     said: "Lupin, my boy, what are you doing? How wicked of you! Some poor fellow would be glad to
     have it." Lupin replied: "I would not insult any poor fellow by giving it to him."</p>
    <p>When he had gone outside, I picked up the battered hat, and saw inside "Posh's Patent." Poor
     Lupin! I can forgive him. It seemed hours before we reached the office. Mr. Perkupp sent for
     Lupin, who was with him nearly an hour. He returned, as I thought, crestfallen in appearance. I
     said: "Well, Lupin, how about Mr. Perkupp?" Lupin commenced his song: "What's the matter with
     Perkupp? He's all right!" I felt instinc­tively my boy was engaged. I went to Mr. Perkupp, but
     I could not speak. He said: "Well, Mr. Pooter, what is it?" I must have looked a fool, for all
     I could say was: "Mr. Perkupp, you are a
     <pb n="214"/> good man." He looked at me for a moment, and said: "No, Mr. Pooter, <hi>you</hi>
     are the good man; and we'll see if we cannot get your son to follow such an excellent example."
     I said: "Mr. Perkupp, may I go home? I cannot work any more to-day."</p>
    <p>My good master shook my hand warmly as he nodded his head. It was as much as I could do to
     prevent myself from crying in the 'bus; in fact, I should have done so had my thoughts not been
     interrupted by Lupin, who was having a quarrel with a fat man in the 'bus, whom he accused of
     taking up too much room.</p>
    <p>In the evening Carrie sent round for dear old friend Cummings and his wife, and also to
     Gowing. We all sat round the fire, and in a bottle of "Jackson Frères," which Sarah fetched
     from the grocer's, drank Lupin's health. I lay awake for hours, thinking of the future. My boy
     in the same office as myself-we can go down together by the 'bus, come home together, and who
     knows but in the course of time he may take great interest in our little home. That he may help
     me to put a nail in here or a nail in there, or help his dear mother to hang a picture. In the
     summer he may help us in our little garden with the flowers, and assist us to paint the stands
     and pots. (By-the-by, I must get
     <pb n="215-216"/> in some more enamel paint.) All this I thought over and over again, and a
     thousand happy thoughts beside. I heard the clock strike four, and soon after fell asleep, only
     to dream of three happy people. Lupin, dear Carrie, and myself.</p>

    <p>Trouble with a stylographic pen. We go to a Volunteer Ball, where I am let in for an
     expensive supper. Grossly insulted by a cabman. An odd invitation to Southend.</p>
    <p><label>April 8</label>—No events of any importance, except that Gowing strongly recommended a
     new patent stylographic pen, which cost me nine-and-sixpence, and which was simply
     nine-and-sixpence thrown in the mud. It has caused me constant annoyance and irritability of
     temper. The ink oozes out of the top, making a mess on my hands, and once at the office when I
     was knocking the palm of my hand on the desk to jerk the ink down, Mr. Perkupp, who had just
     entered, called out: "Stop that knocking! I suppose that is you, Mr. Pitt?" That young monkey,
     Pitt, took a malicious glee in responding quite loudly: "No, sir; I beg pardon, it is Mr.
     Pooter with his pen; it has been going on all the morning." To make matters worse, I saw Lupin
     <pb n="220"/> laughing behind his desk. I thought it wiser to say nothing. I took the pen back
     to the shop and asked them if they would take it back, as it did not act. I did not expect the
     full price returned, but was willing to take half. The man said he could not do that-buying and
     selling were two different things. Lupin's conduct during the period he has been in Mr.
     Perkupp's office has been most exemplary. My only fear is, it is too good to last.</p>
    <p><label>April 9.</label>—Gowing called, bringing with him an invitation for Carrie and myself
     to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which he thought would be a swell affair, as
     the member for East Acton (Sir William Grime) had promised his patronage. We accepted of his
     kindness, and he stayed to supper, an occasion I thought suitable for trying a bottle of the
     sparkling Algéra that Mr. James (of Sutton) had sent as a present. Gowing sipped the wine,
     observing that he had never tasted it before, and further remarked that his policy was to stick
     to more recognised brands. I told him it was a present from a dear friend, and one mustn't look
     a gift-horse in the mouth. Gowing facetiously replied: "And he didn't like putting it in the
     mouth either."</p>
    <pb n="221"/>
    <p>I thought the remarks were rude without being funny, but on tasting it myself, came to the
     conclusion there was some justification for them. The sparkling Algéra is very like cider, only
     more sour. I suggested that perhaps the thunder had turned it a bit acid. He merely replied:
     "Oh! I don't think so." We had a very pleasant game of cards, though I lost four shillings and
     Carrie lost one, and Gowing said he had lost about sixpence: how <hi>he</hi> could have lost,
     considering that Carrie and I were the only other players, remains a mystery.</p>
    <p><label>April 14, Sunday.</label>—Owing, I presume, to the unsettled weather, I awoke with a
     feeling that my skin was drawn over my face as tight as a drum. Walking round the garden with
     Mr. and Mrs. Treane, members of our congregation who had walked back with us, I was much
     annoyed to find a large newspaper full of bones on the gravel-path, evidently thrown over by
     those young Griffin boys next door; who, whenever we have friends, climb up the empty steps
     inside their conservatory, tap at the windows, making faces, whistling, and imitating
     birds.</p>
    <p><label>April 15.</label>—Burnt my tongue most awfully with the Worcester sauce, through that
     stupid girl Sarah
     <pb n="222"/> shaking the bottle violently before putting it on the table.</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic222"/>


    <p><label>April 16.</label>—The night of the East Acton Volunteer Ball. On my advice, Carrie put
     on the same dress that she looked so beautiful in at the Mansion
     <pb n="223"/> House, for it had occurred to me, being a military ball, that Mr. Perkupp, who, I
     believe, is an officer in the Honourary Artillery Company, would in all probability be present.
     Lupin, in his usual incompre­hensible language, remarked that he had heard it was a "bounders'
     ball." I didn't ask him what he meant though I didn't understand. Where he gets these
     expressions from I don't know; he certainly doesn't learn them at home.</p>
    <p>The invitation was for half-past eight, so I concluded if we arrived an hour later we should
     be in good time, without being "unfashionable," as Mrs. James says. It was very difficult to
     find-the cabman having to get down several times to inquire at different public-houses where
     the Drill Hall was. I wonder at people living in such out-of-the-way places. No one seemed to
     know it. However, after going up and down a good many badly-lighted streets we arrived at our
     destination. I had no idea it was so far from Holloway. I gave the cabman five shillings, who
     only grumbled, saying it was dirt cheap at half-a-sovereign, and was impertinent enough to
     advise me the next time I went to a ball to take a 'bus.</p>
    <p>Captain Welcut received us, saying we were rather late, but that it was better late than
     <pb n="224"/> never. He seemed a very good-looking gentleman, though, as Carrie remarked,
     "rather short for an officer." He begged to be excused for leaving us, as he was engaged for a
     dance, and hoped we should make ourselves at home. Carrie took my arm and we walked round the
     rooms two or three times and watched the people dancing. I couldn't find a single person I
     knew, but attributed it to most of them being in uniform. As we were entering the supper-room I
     received a slap on the shoulder, followed by a welcome shake of the hand. I said: "Mr. Padge, I
     believe;" he replied, "That's right."</p>
    <p>I gave Carrie a chair, and seated by her was a lady who made herself at home with Carrie at
     once.</p>
    <p>There was a very liberal repast on the tables, plenty of champagne, claret, etc., and, in
     fact, everything seemed to be done regardless of expense. Mr. Padge is a man that, I admit, I
     have no particular liking for, but I felt so glad to come across some one I knew, that I asked
     him to sit at our table, and I must say that for a short fat man he looked well in uniform,
     although I think his tunic was rather baggy in the back. It was the only supper-room that I
     have been in that was not overcrowded; in
     <pb n="225"/> fact we were the only people there, everybody being so busy dancing.</p>
    <p>I assisted Carrie and her newly-formed acquaintance, who said her name was Lupkin, to some
     champagne; also myself, and handed the bottle to Mr. Padge to do likewise, saying: "You must
     look after yourself." He replied: "That's right," and poured out half a tumbler and drank
     Carrie's health, coupled, as he said, "with her worthy lord and master." We all had some
     splendid pigeon pie, and ices to follow.</p>
    <p>The waiters were very attentive, and asked if we would like some more wine. I assisted Carrie
     and her friend and Mr. Padge, also some people who had just come from the dancing-room, who
     were very civil. It occurred to me at the time that perhaps some of the gentlemen knew me in
     the City, as they were so polite. I made myself useful, and assisted several ladies to ices,
     remembering an old saying that "There is nothing lost by civility."</p>
    <p>The band struck up for the dance, and they all went into the ball-room. The ladies (Carrie
     and Mrs. Lupkin) were anxious to see the dancing, and as I had not quite finished my supper,
     Mr. Padge offered his arms to them and escorted
     <pb n="226"/> them to the ball-room, telling me to follow. I said to Mr. Padge: "It is quite a
     West End affair," to to which remark Mr. Padge replied; "That's right."</p>
    <p>When I had quite finished my supper, and was leaving, the waiter who had been attending on us
     arrested my attention by tapping me on the shoulder. I thought it unusual for a waiter at a
     private ball to expect a tip, but nevertheless gave a shilling, as he had been very attentive.
     He smilingly replied: "I beg your pardon, sir, this is no good," alluding to the shilling.
     "Your party's had four suppers at 5s. a head, five ices at 1s., three bottles of champagne at
     11s. 6d., a glass of claret, and a sixpenny cigar for the stout gentleman-in all £3 0s.
     6d.!"</p>
    <p>I don't think I was ever so surprised in my life, and had only sufficient breath to inform
     him that I had received a private invitation, to which he answered that he was perfectly well
     aware of that; but that the invitation didn't include eatables and drinkables. A gentleman who
     was standing at the bar corroborated the waiter's statement, and assured me it was quite
     correct.</p>
    <p>The waiter said he was extremely sorry if I had been under any misappre­hension; but it was
     not his
     <pb n="227"/> fault. Of course there was nothing to be done but to pay. So, after turning out
     my pockets, I just managed to scrape up sufficient, all but nine shillings; but the manager, on
     my giving my card to him, said: "That's all right."</p>
    <p>I don't think I ever felt more humiliated in my life, and I determined to keep this
     misfortune from Carrie, for it would entirely destroy the pleasant evening she was enjoying. I
     felt there was no more enjoyment for me that evening, and it being late, I sought Carrie and
     Mrs. Lupkin. Carrie said she was quite ready to go, and Mrs. Lupkin, as we were wishing her
     "Good-night," asked Carrie and myself if we ever paid a visit to Southend? On my replying that
     I hadn't been there for many years, she very kindly said: "Well, why don't you come down and
     stay at our place?" As her invitation was so pressing, and observing that Carrie wished to go,
     we promised we would visit her the next Saturday week, and stay till Monday. Mrs. Lupkin said
     she would write to us to-morrow, giving us the address and particulars of trains, etc.</p>
    <p>When we got outside the Drill Hall it was raining so hard that the roads resembled canals,
     and I need hardly say we had great difficulty in getting a cabman to take us to Holloway. After
     waiting a
     <pb n="228"/> bit, a man said he would drive us, anyhow, as far as "The Angel," at Islington,
     and we could easily get another cab from there. It was a tedious journey; the rain was beating
     against the windows and trickling down the inside of the cab.</p>
    <p>When we arrived at "The Angel" the horse seemed tired out. Carrie got out and ran into a
     doorway, and when I came to pay, to my absolute horror I remembered I had no money, nor had
     Carrie. I explained to the cabman how we were situated. Never in my life have I ever been so
     insulted; the cabman, who was a rough bully and to my thinking not sober, called me every name
     he could lay his tongue to, and positively seized me by the beard, which he pulled till the
     tears came into my eyes. I took the number of a policeman (who witnessed the assault) for not
     taking the man in charge. The policeman said he couldn't interfere, that he had seen no
     assault, and that people should not ride in cabs without money.</p>
    <p>We had to walk home in the pouring rain, nearly two miles, and when I got in I put down the
     conversation I had with the cabman, word for word, as I intend writing to the
      <title>Telegraph</title> for the purpose of proposing that cabs should be driven only by men
     under Government control, to prevent civilians
     <pb n="229"/> being subjected to the disgraceful insult and outrage that I had had to
     endure.</p>
    <p><label>April 17.</label>—No water in our cistern again. Sent for Putley, who said he would
     soon remedy that, the cistern being zinc.</p>
    <p><label>April 18.</label>—Water all right again in the cistern. Mrs. James, of Sutton, called
     in the afternoon. She and Carrie draped the mantelpiece in the drawing-room, and put little toy
     spiders, frogs, and beetles all over it, as Mrs. James says it's quite the fashion. It was Mrs.
     James' suggestion, and of course Carrie always does what Mrs. James suggests. For my part, I
     preferred the mantelpiece as it was; but there, I'm a plain man, and don't pretend to be in the
     fashion.</p>
    <p><label>April 19.</label>—Our next-door neighbour, Mr. Griffin, called, and in a rather
     offensive tone accused me, or "some one," of boring a hole in his cistern and letting out his
     water to supply our cistern, which adjoined his. He said he should have his repaired, and send
     us in the bill.</p>
    <p><label>April 20.</label>—Cummings called, hobbling in with a stick, saying he had been on his
     back for a week.
     <pb n="230"/> It appears he was trying to shut his bedroom door, which is situated just at the
     top of the staircase, and unknown to him a piece of cork the dog had been playing with had got
     between the door, and prevented it shutting; and in pulling the door hard, to give it an extra
     slam, the handle came off in his hands, and he fell backwards downstairs.</p>
    <p>On hearing this, Lupin suddenly jumped up from the couch and rushed out of the room sideways.
     Cummings looked very indignant, and remarked it was very poor fun a man nearly breaking his
     back; and though I had my suspicions that Lupin was laughing, I assured Cummings that he had
     only run out to open the door to a friend he expected. Cummings said this was the second time
     he had been laid up, and we had never sent to enquire. I said I knew nothing about it. Cummings
     said: "It was mentioned in the <title>Bicycle News</title>."</p>
    <p><label>April 22.</label>—I have of late frequently noticed Carrie rubbing her nails a good
     deal with an instrument, and on asking her what she was doing, she replied: "Oh, I'm going in
     for manicuring. It's all the fashion now." I said: "I suppose Mrs. James introduced that into
     your head." Carrie laughingly replied: "Yes; but everyone does it now."</p>
    <pb n="231"/>
    <p>I wish Mrs. James wouldn't come to the house. Whenever she does she always introduces some
     new-fandangled rubbish into Carrie's head. One of these days I feel sure I shall tell her she's
     not welcome. I am sure it was Mrs. James who put Carrie up to writing on dark slate-coloured
     paper with white ink. Nonsense!</p>
    <p><label>April 23.</label>—Received a letter from Mrs. Lupkin, of Southend, telling us the
     train to come by on Saturday, and hoping we will keep our promise to stay with her. The letter
     concluded: "You must come and stay at our house; we shall charge you half what you will have to
     pay at the Royal, and the view is every bit as good." Looking at the address at the top of the
     note-paper, I found it was: "Lupkin's Family and Commercial Hotel."</p>
    <p>I wrote a note, saying we were compelled to "decline her kind invitation." Carrie thought
     this very satirical, and to the point.</p>
    <p>By-the-by, I will never choose another cloth pattern at night. I ordered a new suit of dittos
     for the garden at Edwards', and chose the pattern by gaslight, and they seemed to be a quiet
     pepper-and-salt mixture with white stripes down. They came home this morning, and, to my
     horror, I found it
     <pb n="232"/> was quite a flash-looking suit. There was a lot of green with bright
     yellow-coloured stripes.</p>
    <p>I tried on the coat, and was annoyed to find Carrie giggling. She said: "What mixture did you
     say you asked for?"</p>
    <p>I said: "A quiet pepper and salt."</p>
    <p>Carrie said: "Well, it looks more like mustard, if you want to know the truth."</p>

    <p>Meet Teddy Finsworth, an old schoolfellow. We have a pleasant and quiet dinner at his
     uncle's, marred only by a few awkward mistakes on my part respecting Mr. Finsworth's pictures.
     A discussion on dreams.</p>
    <p><label>April 27</label>—Kept a little later than usual at the office, and as I was hurrying
     along a man stopped me, saying: "Hulloh! That's a face I know." I replied politely: "Very
     likely; lots of people know <hi>me</hi>, although I may not know them." He replied: "But you
     know <hi>me</hi>—Teddy Finsworth." So it was. He was at the same school with me. I had not seen
     him for years and years. No wonder I did not know him! At school he was at least a head taller
     than I was; now I am at least a head taller than he is, and he has a thick beard, almost grey.
     He insisted on my having a glass of wine (a thing I never do), and told me he lived at
     Middlesboro', where he was Deputy Town Clerk, a position which was as high as the Town Clerk of
     London-in fact, higher. He
     <pb n="236"/> added that he was staying for a few days in London, with his uncle, Mr. Edgar
     Paul Finsworth (of Finsworth and Pultwell). He said he was sure his uncle would be only too
     pleased to see me, and he had a nice house, Watney Lodge, only a few minutes' walk from Muswell
     Hill Station. I gave him our address, and we parted.</p>
    <p>In the evening, to my surprise, he called with a very nice letter from Mr. Finsworth, saying
     if we (including Carrie) would dine with them to-morrow (Sunday), at two o'clock, he would be
     delighted. Carrie did not like to go; but Teddy Finsworth pressed us so much we consented.
     Carrie sent Sarah round to the butcher's and countermanded our half-leg of mutton, which we had
     ordered for to-morrow.</p>
    <p><label>April 28, Sunday.</label>—We found Watney Villa further off than we anticipated, and
     only arrived as the clock struck two, both feeling hot and uncomfortable. To make matters
     worse, a large collie dog pounced forward to receive us. He barked loudly and jumped up at
     Carrie, covering her light skirt, which she was wearing for the first time, with mud. Teddy
     Finsworth came out and drove the dog off and apologised. We were shown into the drawing-room,
     <pb n="237"/> which was beautifully decorated. It was full of knick-knacks, and some plates
     hung up on the wall. There were several little wooden milk-stools with paintings on them; also
     a white wooden banjo, painted by one of Mr. Paul Finsworth's nieces-a cousin of Teddy's.</p>
    <p>Mr. Paul Finsworth seemed quite a distinguished-looking elderly gentleman, and was most
     gallant to Carrie. There were a great many water-colours hanging on the walls, mostly different
     views of India, which were very bright. Mr. Finsworth said they were painted by "Simpz," and
     added that he was no judge of pictures himself but had been informed on good authority that
     they were worth some hundreds of pounds, although he had only paid a few shillings apiece for
     them, frames included, at a sale in the neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>There was also a large picture in a very handsome frame, done in coloured crayons. It looked
     like a religious subject. I was very much struck with the lace collar, it looked so real, but I
     unfortunately made the remark that there was something about the expression of the face that
     was not quite pleasing. It looked pinched. Mr. Finsworth sorrowfully replied: "Yes, the face
     was done after death-my wife's sister."</p>
    <pb n="238"/>
    <p>I felt terribly awkward and bowed apologetically, and in a whisper said I hoped I had not
     hurt his feelings. We both stood looking at the picture for a few minutes in silence, when Mr.
     Finsworth took out a handkerchief and said: "She was sitting in our garden last summer," and
     blew his nose violently. He seemed quite affected, so I turned to look at something else and
     stood in front of a portrait of a jolly-looking middle-aged gentleman, with a red face and
     straw hat. I said to Mr. Finsworth: "Who is this jovial-looking gentleman? Life doesn't seem to
     trouble him much." Mr. Finsworth said: "No, it doesn't. <hi>He is dead too</hi>—my
     brother."</p>
    <p>I was absolutely horrified at my own stupid awkwardness. Fortunately at this moment Carrie
     entered with Mrs. Finsworth, who had taken her upstairs to take off her bonnet and brush her
     skirt. Teddy said: "Short is late," but at that moment the gentleman referred to arrived, and I
     was introduced to him by Teddy, who said: "Do you know Mr. Short?" I replied, smiling, that I
     had not that pleasure, but I hoped it would not be <hi>long</hi> before I knew Mr.
      <hi>Short</hi>. He evidently did not see my little joke, although I repeated it twice with a
     little laugh. I suddenly remembered it was Sunday, and Mr. Short was perhaps <hi>very
      particular</hi>.</p>
    <pb n="239"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic239"/>



    <pb n="240"/>
    <p>In this I was mistaken, for he was not at all particular in several of his remarks after
     dinner. In fact I was so ashamed of one of his observations that I took the opportunity to say
     to Mrs. Finsworth that I feared she found Mr. Short occasionally a little embarrassing. To my
     surprise she said: "Oh! he is privileged you know." I did <hi>not</hi> know as a matter of fact
     and so I bowed apologetically. I fail to see why Mr. Short should be privileged.</p>
    <p>Another thing that annoyed me at dinner was that the collie dog, which jumped up at Carrie,
     was allowed to remain under the dining-room table. It kept growling and snapping at my boots
     every time I moved my foot. Feeling nervous rather, I spoke to Mrs. Finsworth about the animal,
     and she remarked: "It is only his play." She jumped up and let in a frightfully ugly-looking
     spaniel called Bibbs, which had been scratching at the door. This dog also seemed to take a
     fancy to my boots, and I discovered afterwards that it had licked off every bit of blacking
     from them. I was positively ashamed of being seen in them. Mrs. Finsworth, who, I must say, is
     not much of a Job's comforter, said: "Oh! we are used to Bibbs doing that to our visitors."</p>
    <pb n="241"/>
    <p>Mr. Finsworth had up some fine port, although I question whether it is a good thing to take
     on the top of beer. It made me feel a little sleepy, while it had the effect of inducing Mr.
     Short to become "privileged" to rather an alarming extent. It being cold even for April, there
     was a fire in the drawing-room; we sat round in easy-chairs, and Teddy and I waxed rather
     eloquent over the old school days, which had the effect of sending all the others to sleep. I
     was delighted, as far as Mr. Short was concerned, that it did have that effect on him.</p>
    <p>We stayed till four, and the walk home was remarkable only for the fact that several fools
     giggled at the unpolished state of my boots. Polished them myself when I got home. Went to
     church in the evening, and could scarcely keep awake. I will not take port on the top of beer
     again.</p>
    <p><label>April 29.</label>—I am getting quite accustomed to being snubbed by Lupin, and I do
     not mind being sat upon by Carrie, because I think she has a certain amount of right to do so;
     but I do think it hard to be at once snubbed by wife, son, and both my guests.</p>
    <p>Gowing and Cummings had dropped in during the evening, and I suddenly remembered an
     <pb n="242"/> extraordinary dream I had a few nights ago, and I thought I would tell them about
     it. I dreamt I saw some huge blocks of ice in a shop with a bright glare behind them. I walked
     into the shop and the heat was overpowering. I found that the blocks of ice were on fire. The
     whole thing was so real and yet so supernatural I woke up in a cold perspiration. Lupin in a
     most contemptuous manner, said: "What utter rot."</p>
    <p>Before I could reply, Gowing said there was nothing so completely uninteresting as other
     people's dreams.</p>
    <p>I appealed to Cummings, but he said he was bound to agree with the others and my dream was
     especially nonsensical. I said: "It seemed so real to me." Gowing replied: "Yes, to
      <hi>you</hi> perhaps, but not to <hi>us</hi>." Whereupon they all roared.</p>
    <p>Carrie, who had hitherto been quiet, said: "He tells me his stupid dreams every morning
     nearly." I replied: "Very well, dear, I promise you I will never tell you or anybody else
     another dream of mine the longest day I live." Lupin said: "Hear! hear!" and helped himself to
     another glass of beer. The subject was fortunately changed, and Cummings read a most
     interesting article on the superiority of the bicycle to the horse.</p>

    <p>Dinner at Franching's to meet Mr. Hardfur Huttle.</p>
    <p><label>May 10</label>—Received a letter from Franching, of Peckham, asking us to dine with
     him to-night, at seven o'clock, to meet Mr. Hardfur Huttle, a very clever writer for the
     American papers. Franching apologised for the short notice; but said he had at the last moment
     been disappointed of two of his guests and regarded us as old friends who would not mind
     filling up the gap. Carrie rather demurred at the invitation; but I explained to her that
     Franching was very well off and influential, and we could not afford to offend him. "And we are
     sure to get a good dinner and a good glass of champagne." "Which never agrees with you!" Carrie
     replied, sharply. I regarded Carrie's observation as unsaid. Mr. Franching asked us to wire a
     reply. As he had said nothing about dress in the letter, I wired back: "With pleasure. Is it
     full dress?" and by leaving
     <pb n="246"/> out our name, just got the message within the sixpence.</p>
    <p>Got back early to give time to dress, which we received a telegram instructing us to do. I
     wanted Carrie to meet me at Franching's house; but she would not do so, so I had to go home to
     fetch her. What a long journey it is from Holloway to Peckham! Why do people live such a long
     way off? Having to change 'buses, I allowed plenty of time-in fact, too much; for we arrived at
     twenty minutes to seven, and Franching, so the servant said, had only just gone up to dress.
     However, he was down as the clock struck seven; he must have dressed very quickly.</p>
    <p>I must say it was quite a distinguished party, and although we did not know anybody
     personally, they all seemed to be quite swells. Franching had got a professional waiter, and
     evidently spared no expense. There were flowers on the table round some fairy-lamps, and the
     effect, I must say, was exquisite. The wine was good and there was plenty of champagne,
     concerning which Franching said he, himself, never wished to taste better. We were ten in
     number, and a <hi>menû</hi> card to each. One lady said she always preserved the <hi>menû</hi>
     and got the guests to write their names on the back.</p>
    <pb n="247"/>
    <p>We all of us followed her example, except Mr. Huttle, who was of course the important
     guest.</p>
    <p>The dinner-party consisted of Mr. Franching, Mr. Hardfur Huttle, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel
     Hillbutter, Mrs. Field, Mr. and Mrs. Purdick, Mr. Pratt, Mr. R. Kent, and, last but not least,
     Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pooter. Franching said he was sorry he had no lady for me to take in to
     dinner. I replied that I preferred it, which I afterwards thought was a very uncompli­mentary
     observation to make.</p>
    <p>I sat next to Mrs. Field at dinner, she seemed a well-informed lady, but was very deaf. It
     did not much matter, for Mr. Hardfur Huttle did all the talking. He is a marvellously
     intellectual man and says things which from other people would seem quite alarming. How I wish
     I could remember even a quarter of his brilliant conversation. I made a few little reminding
     notes on the <hi>menû</hi> card.</p>
    <p>One observation struck me as being absolutely powerful-though not to my way of thinking of
     course. Mrs. Purdick happened to say: "You are certainly unorthodox, Mr. Huttle." Mr. Huttle,
     with a peculiar expression (I can see it now) said
     <pb n="248"/> in a slow rich voice: "Mrs. Purdick, 'orthodox' is a grandiloquent word implying
     sticking-in-the-mud. If Columbus and Stephenson had been orthodox, there would neither have
     been the discovery of America nor the steam-engine." There was quite a silence.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n=""/>


    <p>It appeared to me that such teaching was absolutely dangerous, and yet I felt-in fact we must
     all have felt-there was no answer to the argument. A little later on, Mrs. Purdick, who is
     Franching's sister and also acted as hostess, rose from the table, and Mr. Huttle said: "Why,
     ladies, do you deprive us of your company so soon? Why not wait while we have our cigars?"</p>
    <p>The effect was electrical. The ladies (including Carrie) were in no way inclined to be
     deprived of
     <pb n="249"/> Mr. Huttle's fascinating society, and immediately resumed their seats, amid much
     laughter and a little chaff. Mr. Huttle said: "Well, that's a real good sign; you shall not be
     insulted by being called orthodox any longer." Mrs. Purdick, who seemed to be a bright and
     rather sharp woman, said: "Mr. Huttle, we will meet you half-way-that is, till you get half-way
     through your cigar. That, at all events, will be the happy medium."</p>
    <p>I shall never forget the effect the words, "happy medium," had upon him. He was brilliant and
     most daring in his interpretation of the words. He positively alarmed me. He said something
     like the following: "Happy medium, indeed. Do you know 'happy medium' are two words which mean
     'miserable mediocrity.' I say, go first class or third; marry a duchess or her kitchenmaid. The
     happy medium means respectability, and respectability means insipidness. Does it not, Mr.
     Pooter?"</p>
    <p>I was so taken aback by being personally appealed to, that I could only bow apologetically,
     and say I feared I was not competent to offer an opinion. Carrie was about to say something;
     but she was interrupted, for which I was rather pleased, for she is not clever at argument and
     one has to be extra
     <pb n="250"/> clever to discuss a subject with a man like Mr. Huttle.</p>
    <p>He continued, with an amazing eloquence that made his unwelcome opinions positively
     convincing: "The happy medium is nothing more or less than a vulgar half-measure. A man who
     loves champagne and, finding a pint too little, fears to face a whole bottle and has recourse
     to an imperial pint, will never build a Brooklyn Bridge or an Eiffel Tower. No, he is
     half-hearted, he is a half-measure-respectable-in fact, a happy medium, and will spend the rest
     of his days in a suburban villa with a stucco-column portico, resembling a four-post
     bedstead."</p>
    <p>We all laughed.</p>
    <p>"That sort of thing," continued Mr. Huttle, "belongs to a soft man, with a soft beard, with a
     soft head, with a made tie that hooks on."</p>
    <p>This seemed rather personal and twice I caught myself looking in the glass of the
     cheffonière; for <hi>I</hi> had on a tie that hooked on-and why not? If these remarks were not
     personal they were rather careless, and so were some of his subsequent observations, which must
     have made both Mr. Franching and his guests rather uncomfortable. I don't think Mr. Huttle
     meant to be personal, for he added: "We
     <pb n="251"/> don't know that class here, in this country; but we do in America, and I've no
     use for them."</p>
    <p>Franching several times suggested that the wine should be passed round the table, which Mr.
     Huttle did not heed; but continued as if he were giving a lecture:</p>
    <p>"What we want in America is your homes. We live on wheels. Your simple, quiet life and home,
     Mr. Franching, are charming. No display, no pretension! You make no difference in your dinner,
     I dare say, when you sit down by yourself and when you invite us. You have your own personal
     attendant—no hired waiter to breathe on the back of your head."</p>
    <p>I saw Franching palpably wince at this.</p>
    <p>Mr. Huttle continued: "Just a small dinner with a few good things, such as you have this
     evening. You don't insult your guests by sending to the grocer for champagne at six shillings a
     bottle."</p>
    <p>I could not help thinking of "Jackson Frères" at three-and-six!</p>
    <p>"In fact," said Mr. Huttle, "a man is little less than a murderer who does. That is the
     province of the milksop, who wastes his evening at home playing dominoes with his wife. I've
     heard of these people. We don't want them at this table. Our
     <pb n="252"/> party is well selected. We've no use for deaf old women, who cannot follow
     intellectual conversation."</p>
    <p>All our eyes were turned to Mrs. Field, who fortunately, being deaf, did not hear his
     remarks; but continued smiling approval.</p>
    <p>"We have no representative at Mr. Franching's table," said Mr. Huttle, "of the unenlightened
     frivolous matron, who goes to a second class dance at Bayswater and fancies she is in Society.
     Society does not know her; it has no use for her."</p>
    <p>Mr. Huttle paused for a moment and the opportunity was afforded for the ladies to rise. I
     asked Mr. Franching quietly to excuse me, as I did not wish to miss the last train, which we
     very nearly did, by-the-by, through Carrie having mislaid the little cloth cricket-cap which
     she wears when we go out.</p>
    <p>It was very late when Carrie and I got home; but on entering the sitting-room I said:
     "Carrie, what do you think of Mr. Hardfur Huttle?" She simply answered: "How like Lupin!" The
     same idea occurred to me in the train. The comparison kept me awake half the night. Mr. Huttle
     was, of course, an older and more influential man; but he was like Lupin, and it made me think
     how dangerous
     <pb n="253-254"/> Lupin would be if he were older and more influential. I feel proud to
     think Lupin <hi>does</hi> resemble Mr. Huttle in some ways. Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has
     original and sometimes wonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous. They make
     men extremely rich or extremely poor. They make or break men. I always feel people are happier
     who live a simple unsophis­ticated life. I believe I am happy because I am not ambitious.
     Somehow I feel that Lupin, since he has been with Mr. Perkupp, has become content to settle
     down and follow the footsteps of his father. This is a comfort.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
    <p>Lupin is discharged. We are in great trouble. Lupin gets engaged elsewhere at a handsome
     salary.</p>
    <p><label>May 13</label>—A terrible misfortune has happened: Lupin is discharged from Mr.
     Perkupp's office; and I scarcely know how I am writing my diary. I was away from office last
      <hi>Sat</hi>, the first time I have been absent through illness for twenty years. I believe I
     was poisoned by some lobster. Mr. Perkupp was also absent, as Fate would have it; and our most
     valued customer, Mr. Crowbillon, went to the office in a rage, and withdrew his custom. My boy
     Lupin not only had the assurance to receive him, but recommended him the firm of Gylterson,
     Sons, and Co. Limited. In my own humble judgment, and though I have to say it against my own
     son, this seems an act of treachery.</p>
    <p>This morning I receive a letter from Perkupp, informing me that Lupin's services are no
     longer required, and an interview with me is desired at
     <pb n="258"/> eleven o'clock. I went down to the office with an aching heart, dreading an
     interview with Mr. Perkupp, with whom I have never had a word. I saw nothing of Lupin in the
     morning. He had not got up when it was time for me to leave, and Carrie said I should do no
     good by disturbing him. My mind wandered so at the office that I could not do my work
     properly.</p>
    <p>As I expected, I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, and the following conversation ensued as nearly
     as I can remember it.</p>
    <p>Mr. Perkupp said: "Good-morning, Mr. Pooter! This is a very serious business. I am not
     referring so much to the dismissal of your son, for I knew we should have to part sooner or
     later. <hi>I</hi> am the head of this old, influential, and much-respected firm; and when
      <hi>I</hi> consider the time has come to revolutionise the business, <hi>I</hi> will do it
     myself."</p>
    <p>I could see my good master was somewhat affected, and I said: "I hope, sir, you do not
     imagine that I have in any way countenanced my son's unwarrantable interference?" Mr. Perkupp
     rose from his seat and took my hand, and said: "Mr. Pooter, I would as soon suspect myself as
     suspect you." I was so agitated that in the confusion, to show my gratitude, I very nearly
     called him a "grand old man."</p>
    <pb n="259"/>
    <p>Fortunately I checked myself in time, and said he was a "grand old master." I was so
     unaccountable for my actions that I sat down, leaving him standing. Of course, I at once rose,
     but Mr. Perkupp bade me sit down, which I was very pleased to do. Mr. Perkupp, resuming, said:
     "You will understand, Mr. Pooter, that the high-standing nature of our firm will not admit of
     our bending to anybody. If Mr. Crowbillon chooses to put his work into other hands-I may add,
     less experienced hands-it is not for us to bend and beg back his custom." "You <hi>shall</hi>
     not do it, sir," I said with indignation. "Exactly," replied Mr. Perkupp; "I shall <hi>not</hi>
     do it. But I was thinking this, Mr. Pooter. Mr. Crowbillon is our most valued client, and I
     will even confess-for I know this will not go beyond ourselves-that we cannot afford very well
     to lose him, especially in these times, which are not of the brightest. Now, I fancy you can be
     of service."</p>
    <p>I replied: "Mr. Perkupp, I will work day and night to serve you!"</p>
    <p>Mr. Perkupp said: "I know you will. Now, what I should like you to do is this. You yourself
     might write to Mr. Crowbillon-you must not, of course, lead him to suppose I know anything
     about your doing so-and explain to him that your son was
     <pb n="260"/> only taken on as a clerk-quite an inexperienced one in fact-out of the respect
     the firm had for you, Mr. Pooter. This is, of course, a fact. I don't suggest that you should
     speak in too strong terms of your own son's conduct; but I may add, that had he been a son of
     mine, I should have condemned his interference with no measured terms. That I leave to you. I
     think the result will be that Mr. Crowbillon will see the force of the foolish step he has
     taken, and our firm will neither suffer in dignity nor in pocket."</p>
    <p>I could not help thinking what a noble gentleman Mr. Perkupp is. His manners and his way of
     speaking seem to almost thrill one with respect.</p>
    <p>I said: "Would you like to see the letter before I send it?"</p>
    <p>Mr. Perkupp said: "Oh no! I had better not. I am supposed to know nothing about it, and I
     have every confidence in you. You must write the letter carefully. We are not very busy; you
     had better take the morning to-morrow, or the whole day if you like. I shall be here myself all
     day to-morrow, in fact all the week, in case Mr. Crowbillon should call."</p>
    <p>I went home a little more cheerful, but I left word with Sarah that I could not see either
     Gowing
     <pb n="261"/> or Cummings, nor in fact anybody, if they called in the evening. Lupin came into
     the parlour for a moment with a new hat on, and asked my opinion of it. I said I was not in the
     mood to judge of hats, and I did not think he was in a position to buy a new one. Lupin replied
     carelessly: "I didn't buy it; it was a present."</p>
    <p>I have such terrible suspicions of Lupin now that I scarcely like to ask him questions, as I
     dread the answers so. He, however, saved me the trouble.</p>
    <p>He said: "I met a friend, an old friend, that I did not quite think a friend at the time; but
     it's all right. As he wisely said, 'all is fair in love and war,' and there was no reason why
     we should not be friends still. He's a jolly, good, all-round sort of fellow, and a very
     different stamp from that inflated fool of a Perkupp."</p>
    <p>I said: "Hush, Lupin! Do not pray add insult to injury."</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "What do you mean by injury? I repeat, I have done no injury. Crowbillon is
     simply tired of a stagnant stick-in-the-mud firm, and made the change on his own account. I
     simply recommended the new firm as a matter of biz-good old biz!"</p>
    <pb n="262"/>
    <p>I said quietly: "I don't understand your slang, and at my time of life have no desire to
     learn it; so, Lupin, my boy, let us change the subject. I will, if it please you, <hi>try</hi>
     and be interested in your new hat adventure."</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Oh! there's nothing much about it, except I have not once seen him since his
     marriage, and he said he was very pleased to see me, and hoped we should be friends. I stood a
     drink to cement the friendship, and he stood me a new hat-one of his own."</p>
    <p>I said rather wearily: "But you have not told me your old friend's name?"</p>
    <p>Lupin said, with affected carelessness: "Oh! didn't I? Well, I will. It was <hi>Murray
      Posh</hi>."</p>
    <p><label>May 14.</label>—Lupin came down late, and seeing me at home all the morning, asked the
     reason of it. Carrie and I both agreed it was better to say nothing to him about the letter I
     was writing, so I evaded the question.</p>
    <p>Lupin went out, saying he was going to lunch with Murray Posh in the City. I said I hoped Mr.
     Posh would provide him with a berth. Lupin went out laughing, saying: "I don't mind
      <hi>wearing</hi> Posh's one-priced hats, but I am not going
     <pb n="263"/> to <hi>sell</hi> them." Poor boy, I fear he is perfectly hopeless.</p>
    <p>It took me nearly the whole day to write to Mr. Crowbillon. Once or twice I asked Carrie for
     suggestions; and although it seems ungrateful, her suggestions were none of them to the point,
     while one or two were absolutely idiotic. Of course I did not tell her so. I got the letter
     off, and took it down to the office for Mr. Perkupp to see, but he again repeated that he could
     trust me.</p>
    <p>Gowing called in the evening, and I was obliged to tell him about Lupin and Mr. Perkupp; and,
     to my surprise, he was quite inclined to side with Lupin. Carrie joined in, and said she
     thought I was taking much too melancholy a view of it. Gowing produced a pint sample-bottle of
     Maderia, which had been given him, which he said would get rid of the blues. I dare say it
     would have done so if there had been more of it; but as Gowing helped himself to three glasses,
     it did not leave much for Carrie and me to get rid of the blues with.</p>
    <p><label>May 15.</label>—A day of great anxiety, for I expected every moment a letter from Mr.
     Crowbillon. Two letters came in the evening-one for me, with "Crowbillon Hall" printed in large
     gold-and-red
     <pb n="264"/> letters on the back of the envelope; the other for Lupin, which I felt inclined
     to open and read, as it had "Gylterson, Sons, and Co. Limited," which was the recommended firm.
     I trembled as I opened Mr. Crowbillon's letter. I wrote him sixteen pages, closely written; he
     wrote me less than sixteen lines.</p>
    <p>His letter was: "Sir,-I totally disagree with you. Your son, in the course of five minutes'
     conversation, displayed more intelligence than your firm has done during the last five
     years.-Yours faithfully, Gilbert E. Gillam O. Crowbillon."</p>
    <p>What am I to do? Here is a letter that I dare not show to Mr. Perkupp, and would not show to
     Lupin for anything. The crisis had yet to come; for Lupin arrived, and, opening his letter,
     showed a cheque for £25 as a commission for the recommendation of Mr. Crowbillon, whose custom
     to Mr. Perkupp is evidently lost for ever. Cummings and Gowing both called, and both took
     Lupin's part. Cummings went so far as to say that Lupin would make a name yet. I suppose I was
     melancholy, for I could only ask: "Yes, but what sort of name?"</p>
    <p><label>May 16.</label>—I told Mr. Perkupp the contents of the
     <pb n="265"/> letter in a modified form, but Mr. Perkupp said: "Pray don't discuss the matter;
     it is at an end. Your son will bring his punishment upon himself." I went home in the evening,
     thinking of the hopeless future of Lupin. I found him in most extravagant spirits and in
     evening-dress. He threw a letter on the table for me to read.</p>
    <p>To my amazement, I read that Gylterson and Sons had absolutely engaged Lupin at a salary of
     £200 a year, with other advantages. I read the letter through three times and thought it must
     have been for me. But there it was-Lupin Pooter-plain enough. I was silent. Lupin said: "What
     price Perkupp now? You take my tip, Guv.-'off' with Perkupp and freeze on to Gylterson, the
     firm of the future! Perkupp's firm? The stagnant dummies have been standing still for years,
     and now are moving back. I want to go on. In fact I must go <hi>off</hi>, as I am dining with
     the Murray Poshs to-night."</p>
    <p>In the exuberance of his spirits he hit his hat with his stick, gave a loud war "Whoo-oop,"
     jumped over a chair, and took the liberty of rumpling my hair all over my forehead, and bounced
     out of the room, giving me no chance of reminding him of his age and the respect which
     <pb n="266"/> was due to his parent. Gowing and Cummings came in the evening, and positively
     cheered me up with congratu­lations respecting Lupin.</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "I always said he would get on, and, take my word, he has more in his head than
     we three put together."</p>
    <p>Carrie said: "He is a second Hardfur Huttle."</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
    <p>Master Percy Edgar Smith James. Mrs. James (of Sutton) visits us again and introduces
     "Spiritual Séances."</p>
    <p><label>May 26,</label>
     <label>Sunday</label>—We went to Sutton after dinner to have meat-tea with Mr. and Mrs. James.
     I had no appetite, having dined well at two, and the entire evening was spoiled by little
     Percy-their only son-who seems to me to be an utterly spoiled child.</p>
    <p>Two or three times he came up to me and deliberately kicked my shins. He hurt me once so much
     that the tears came into my eyes. I gently remonstrated with him, and Mrs. James said: "Please
     don't scold him; I do not believe in being too severe with young children. You spoil their
     character."</p>
    <p>Little Percy set up a deafening yell here, and when Carrie tried to pacify him, he slapped
     her face.</p>
    <p>I was so annoyed, I said: "That is not my idea of bringing up children, Mrs. James."</p>
    <pb n="270"/>
    <p>Mrs. James said: "People have different ideas of bringing up children-even your son Lupin is
     not the standard of perfection."</p>
    <p>A Mr. Mezzini (an Italian, I fancy) here took Percy in his lap. The child wriggled and kicked
     and broke away from Mr. Mezzini, saying: "I don't like you-you've got a dirty face."</p>
    <p>A very nice gentleman, Mr. Birks Spooner, took the child by the wrist and said: "Come here,
     dear, and listen to this."</p>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic270"/>


    <p>He detached his chronometer from the chain and made his watch strike six.</p>
    <p>To our horror, the child snatched it from his hand and bounced it down upon the ground like
     one would a ball.</p>
    <p>Mr. Birks Spooner was most amiable, and said he could easily get a new glass put in, and did
     not suppose the works were damaged.</p>
    <p>To show you how people's opinions differ, Carrie said the child was bad-tempered, but it made
     up
     <pb n="271"/> for that defect by its looks, for it was-in her mind-an unquestionably beautiful
     child.</p>
    <p>I may be wrong, but I do not think I have seen a much uglier child myself. That is
      <hi>my</hi> opinion.</p>
    <p><label>May 30.</label>—I don't known why it is, but I never anticipate with any pleasure the
     visits to our house of Mrs. James, of Sutton. She is coming again to stay for a few days. I
     said to Carrie this morning, as I was leaving: "I wish, dear Carrie, I could like Mrs. James
     better than I do."</p>
    <p>Carrie said: "So do I, dear; but as for years I have had to put up with Mr. Gowing, who is
     vulgar, and Mr. Cummings, who is kind but most uninteresting, I am sure, dear, you won't mind
     the occasional visits of Mrs. James, who has more intellect in her little finger than both your
     friends have in their entire bodies."</p>
    <p>I was so entirely taken back by this onslaught on my two dear old friends, I could say
     nothing, and as I heard the 'bus coming, I left with a hurried kiss-a little too hurried,
     perhaps, for my upper lip came in contact with Carrie's teeth and slightly cut it. It was quite
     painful for an hour afterwards. When I came home in the evening I found Carrie buried in a book
     on Spiritualism, called <title>There is no Birth</title>, by
     <pb n="272"/> Florence Singleyet. I need scarcely say the book was sent her to read by Mrs.
     James, of Sutton. As she had not a word to say outside her book, I spent the rest of the
     evening altering the stair-carpets, which are beginning to show signs of wear at the edges.</p>
    <p>Mrs. James arrived and, as usual, in the evening took the entire management of everything.
     Finding that she and Carrie were making some preparations for table-turning, I thought it time
     really to put my foot down. I have always had the greatest contempt for such nonsense, and put
     an end to it years ago when Carrie, at our old house, used to have séances every night with
     poor Mrs. Fussters (who is now dead). If I could see any use in it, I would not care. As I
     stopped it in the days gone by, I determined to do so now.</p>
    <p>I said: "I am very sorry Mrs. James, but I totally disapprove of it, apart from the fact that
     I receive my old friends on this evening."</p>
    <p>Mrs. James said: "Do you mean to say you haven't read <title>There is no Birth?</title> I
     said: "No, and I have no intention of doing so." Mrs. James seemed surprised and said: "All the
     world is going mad over the book." I responded rather cleverly: "Let it. There will be one sane
     man in it, at all events."</p>
    <pb n="273"/>
    <p>Mrs. James said she thought I was very unkind, and if people were all as prejudiced as I was,
     there would never have been the electric telegraph or the telephone.</p>
    <p>I said that was quite a different thing.</p>
    <p>Mrs. James said sharply: "In what way, pray-in what way?"</p>
    <p>I said: "In many ways."</p>
    <p>Mrs. James said: "Well, mention <hi>one</hi> way."</p>
    <p>I replied quietly: "Pardon me, Mrs. James; I decline to discuss the matter. I am not
     interested in it."</p>
    <p>Sarah at this moment opened the door and showed in Cummings, for which I was thankful, for I
     felt it would put a stop to this foolish table-turning. But I was entirely mistaken; for, on
     the subject being opened again, Cummings said he was most interested in Spiritualism, although
     he was bound to confess he did not believe much in it; still, he was willing to be
     convinced.</p>
    <p>I firmly declined to take any part in it, with the result that my presence was ignored. I
     left the three sitting in the parlour at a small round table which they had taken out of the
     drawing-room. I walked into the hall with the ultimate intention of taking
     <pb n="274"/> a little stroll. As I opened the door, who should come in but Gowing!</p>
    <p>On hearing what was going on, he proposed that we should join the circle and he would go into
     a trance. He added that he <hi>knew</hi> a few things about old Cummings, and would
      <hi>invent</hi> a few about Mrs. James. Knowing how dangerous Gowing is, I declined to let him
     take part in any such foolish performance. Sarah asked me if she could go out for half an hour,
     and I gave her permission, thinking it would be more comfortable to sit with Gowing in the
     kitchen than in the cold drawing-room. We talked a good deal about Lupin and Mr. and Mrs.
     Murray Posh, with whom he is as usual spending the evening. Gowing said: "I say, it wouldn't be
     a bad thing for Lupin if old Posh kicked the bucket."</p>
    <p>My heart gave a leap of horror, and I rebuked Gowing very sternly for joking on such a
     subject. I lay awake half the night thinking of it-the other half was spent in nightmares on
     the same subject.</p>
    <p><label>May 31.</label>—I wrote a stern letter to the laundress. I was rather pleased with the
     letter, for I thought it very satirical. I said: "You have returned the handkerchiefs without
     the colour. Perhaps you will return either the colour or the value of the handkerchiefs."
     <pb n="275"/> I shall be rather curious to know what she will have to say.</p>
    <p>More table-turning in the evening. Carrie said last night was in a measure successful, and
     they ought to sit again. Cummings came in, and seemed interested. I had the gas lighted in the
     drawing-room, got the steps, and repaired the cornice, which has been a bit of an eyesore to
     me. In a fit of unthinkingness-if I may use such an expression,-I gave the floor over the
     parlour, where the séance was taking place, two loud raps with the hammer. I felt sorry
     afterwards, for it was the sort of ridiculous, foolhardy thing that Gowing or Lupin would have
     done.</p>
    <p>However, they never even referred to it; but Carrie declared that a message came through the
     table to her of a wonderful description, concerning someone whom she and I knew years ago, and
     who was quite unknown to the others.</p>
    <p>When we went to bed, Carrie asked me as a favour to sit to-morrow night, to oblige her. She
     said it seemed rather unkind and unsociable on my part. I promised I would sit once.</p>
    <p><label>June 1.</label>—I sat reluctantly at the table in the evening, and I am bound to admit
     some curious things happened. I contend they were coincidences,
     <pb n="276"/> but they were curious. For instance, the table kept tilting towards me, which
     Carrie construed as a desire that I should ask the spirit a question. I obeyed the rules, and I
     asked the spirit (who said her name was Lina) if she could tell me the name of an old aunt of
     whom I was thinking, and whom we used to call Aunt Maggie. The table spelled out C A T. We
     could make nothing out of it, till I suddenly remembered that her second name was Catherine,
     which it was evidently trying to spell. I don't think even Carrie knew this. But if she did,
     she would never cheat. I must admit it was curious. Several other things happened, and I
     consented to sit at another séance on Monday.</p>
    <pb n="[277]"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic277"/>


    <p><label>June 3.</label>—The laundress called, and said she was very sorry about the
     handkerchiefs, and returned ninepence. I said, as the colour was completely washed out and the
     handkerchiefs quite spoiled, ninepence was not enough. Carrie replied that the two
     handkerchiefs originally only cost sixpence, for she remembered buying them at a sale at the
     Holloway <hi>Bon Marché</hi>. In that case, I insisted that threepence should be returned to
     the laundress. Lupin has gone to stay with the Poshs' for a few days. I must say I feel very
     uncomfortable about it.
     <pb n="278"/> Carrie said I was ridiculous to worry about it. Mr. Posh was very fond of Lupin,
     who, after all, was only a mere boy.</p>
    <p>In the evening we had another séance, which, in some respects, was very remarkable, although
     the first part of it was a little doubtful. Gowing called, as well as Cummings, and begged to
     be allowed to join the circle. I wanted to object, but Mrs. James, who appears a good Medium
     (that is, if there is anything in it at all), thought there might be a little more spirit-power
     if Gowing joined; so the five of us sat down.</p>
    <p>The moment I turned out the gas, and almost before I could get my hands on the table, it
     rocked violently and tilted, and began moving quickly across the room. Gowing shouted out:
     "Way, oh! steady, lad, steady!" I told Gowing if he could not behave himself I should light the
     gas, and put an end to the séance. To tell the truth, I thought Gowing was playing tricks, and
     I hinted as much; but Mrs. James said she had often seen the table go right off the ground. The
     spirit Lina came again, and said, "WARN" three or four times, and declined to explain. Mrs.
     James said "Lina" was stubborn sometimes. She often behaved like that, and the best thing to do
     was to send her away.</p>
    <pb n="279"/>
    <p>She then hit the table sharply, and said: "Go away, Lina; you are disagreeable. Go away!" I
     should think we sat nearly three-quarters of an hour with nothing happening. My hands felt
     quite cold, and I suggested we should stop the séance. Carrie and Mrs. James, as well as
     Cummings, would not agree to it. In about ten minutes' time there was some tilting towards me.
     I gave the alphabet, and it spelled out S P O O F. As I have heard both Gowing and Lupin use
     the word, and as I could hear Gowing silently laughing, I directly accused him of pushing the
     table. He denied it; but, I regret to say, I did not believe him.</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "Perhaps it means 'Spook,' a ghost."</p>
    <p>I said: "<hi>You</hi> know it doesn't mean anything of the sort."</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "Oh! very well-I'm sorry I 'spook,'" and he rose from the table.</p>
    <p>No one took any notice of the stupid joke, and Mrs. James suggested he should sit out for a
     while. Gowing consented and sat in the arm-chair.</p>
    <p>The table began to move again, and we might have had a wonderful séance but for Gowing's
     stupid interruptions. In answer to the alphabet from Carrie the table spelt "NIPUL," then the
     "WARN"
     <pb n="280"/> three times. We could not think what it meant till Cummings pointed out that
     "NIPUL" was Lupin spelled backwards. This was quite exciting. Carrie was particularly excited,
     and said she hoped nothing horrible was going to happen.</p>
    <p>Mrs. James asked if "Lina" was the spirit. The table replied firmly, "No," and the spirit
     would not give his or her name. We then had the message, "NIPUL will be very rich."</p>
    <p>Carrie said she felt quite relieved, but the word "WARN" was again spelt out. The table then
     began to oscillate violently, and in reply to Mrs. James, who spoke very softly to the table,
     the spirit began to spell its name. It first spelled "DRINK."</p>
    <p>Gowing here said: "Ah! that's more in my line."</p>
    <p>I asked him to be quiet as the name might not be completed.</p>
    <p>The table then spelt "WATER."</p>
    <p>Gowing here interrupted again, and said: "Ah! that's <hi>not</hi> in my line.
     <hi>Out</hi>side if you like, but not inside."</p>
    <p>Carrie appealed to him to be quiet.</p>
    <p>The table then spelt "CAPTAIN," and Mrs. James startled us by crying out, "Captain
     Drinkwater,
     <pb n="281"/> a very old friend of my father's, who has been dead some years."</p>
    <p>This was more interesting, and I could not help thinking that after all there must be
     something in Spiritualism.</p>
    <p>Mrs. James asked the spirit to interpret the meaning of the word "Warn" as applied to
     "NIPUL." The alphabet was given again, and we got the word "BOSH."</p>
    <p>Gowing here muttered: "So it is."</p>
    <p>Mrs. James said she did not think the spirit meant that, as Captain Drinkwater was a perfect
     gentleman, and would never have used the word in answer to a lady's question. Accordingly the
     alphabet was given again.</p>
    <p>This time the table spelled distinctly "POSH." We all thought of Mrs. Murray Posh and Lupin.
     Carrie was getting a little distressed, and as it was getting late we broke up the circle.</p>
    <p>We arranged to have one more to-morrow, as it will be Mrs. James' last night in town. We also
     determined <hi>not</hi> to have Gowing present.</p>
    <p>Cummings, before leaving, said it was certainly interesting, but he wished the spirits would
     say something about him.</p>
    <pb n="282"/>
    <p><label>June 4.</label>—Quite looking forward to the séance this evening. Was thinking of it
     all the day at the office.</p>
    <p>Just as we sat down at the table we were annoyed by Gowing entering without knocking.</p>
    <p>He said: "I am not going to stop, but I have brought with me a sealed envelope, which I know
     I can trust with Mrs. Pooter. In that sealed envelope is a strip of paper on which I have asked
     a simple question. If the spirits can answer that question, I will believe in
     Spiritualism."</p>
    <p>I ventured the expression that it might be impossible.</p>
    <p>Mrs. James said: "Oh no! it is of common occurrence for the spirits to answer questions under
     such conditions-and even for them to write on locked slates. It is quite worth trying. If
     'Lina' is in a good temper, she is certain to do it."</p>
    <p>Gowing said: "All right; then I shall be a firm believer. I shall perhaps drop in about
     half-past nine or ten, and hear the result."</p>
    <p>He then left and we sat a long time. Cummings wanted to know something about some undertaking
     in which he was concerned, but he could get no answer of any description whatever-at which he
     said he was very disappointed and was afraid there
     <pb n="283"/> was not much in table-turning after all. I thought this rather selfish of him.
     The séance was very similar to the one last night, almost the same in fact. So we turned to the
     letter. "Lina" took a long time answering the question, but eventually spelt out "ROSES,
     LILIES, AND COWS." There was great rocking of the table at this time, and Mrs. James said: "If
     that is Captain Drinkwater, let us ask him the answer as well?"</p>
    <p>It was the spirit of the captain, and, most singular, he gave the same identical answer:
     "ROSES, LILIES, AND COWS."</p>
    <p>I cannot describe the agitation with which Carrie broke the seal, or the disappointment we
     felt on reading the question, to which the answer was so inappropriate. The question was,
      "<hi>What's old Pooter's age?</hi>"</p>
    <p>This quite decided me.</p>
    <p>As I had put my foot down on Spiritualism years ago, so I would again.</p>
    <p>I am pretty easy-going as a rule, but I can be extremely firm when driven to it.</p>
    <p>I said slowly, as I turned up the gas: "This is the last of this nonsense that shall ever
     take place under my roof. I regret I permitted myself to be a party to such tomfoolery. If
     there is anything in it-which
     <pb n="284"/> I doubt-it is nothing of any good, and I <hi>won't have it again</hi>. That is
     enough."</p>
    <p>Mrs. James said: "I think, Mr. Pooter, you are rather overstepping--"</p>
    <p>I said: "Hush, madam. I am the master of this house-please understand that."</p>
    <p>Mrs. James made an observation which I sincerely hope I was mistaken in. I was in such a rage
     I could not quite catch what she said. But if I thought she said what it sounded like, she
     should never enter the house again.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
    <p>Lupin leaves us. We dine at his new apartments, and hear some extraordinary information
     respecting the wealth of Mr. Murray Posh. Meet Miss Lilian Posh. Am sent for by Mr. Hardfur
     Huttle. Important.</p>
    <p><label>July 1</label>—I find, on looking over my diary, nothing of any consequence has taken
     place during the last month. To-day we lose Lupin, who has taken furnished apartments at
     Bayswater, near his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Murray Posh, at two guineas a week. I think this is
     most extravagant of him, as it is half his salary. Lupin says one never loses by a good
     address, and, to use his own expression, Brickfield Terrace is a bit "off." Whether he means it
     is "far off" I do not know. I have long since given up trying to understand his curious
     expressions. I said the neighbourhood had always been good enough for his parents. His reply
     was: "It is no question of being good or bad. There
     <pb n="288"/> is no money in it, and I am not going to rot away my life in the suburbs."</p>
    <p>We are sorry to lose him, but perhaps he will get on better by himself, and there may be some
     truth in his remark that an old and a young horse can't pull together in the same cart.</p>
    <p>Gowing called, and said that the house seemed quite peaceful, and like old times. He liked
     Master Lupin very well, but he occasionally suffered from what he could not help-youth.</p>
    <p><label>July 2.</label>—Cummings called, looking very pale, and said he had been very ill
     again, and of course not a single friend had been near him. Carrie said she had never heard of
     it, whereupon he threw down a copy of the <title>Bicycle News</title> on the table, with the
     following paragraph:-"We regret to hear that that favourite old roadster, Mr. Cummings ('Long'
     Cummings), has met with what might have been a serious accident in Rye Lane. A mischievous boy
     threw a stick between the spokes of one of the back wheels, and the machine overturned,
     bringing our brother tricyclist heavily to the ground. Fortunately he was more frightened than
     hurt, but we missed his merry face at the dinner at Chingford, where they turned up in good
     numbers. 'Long'
     <pb n="289"/> Cummings' health was proposed by our popular Vice, Mr. Westropp, the prince of
     bicyclists, who in his happiest vein said it was a case of '<hi>Cumming</hi>(s) thro' the
      <hi>Rye</hi>, but fortunately there was more <hi>wheel</hi> than <hi>woe</hi>,' a joke which
     created roars of laughter."</p>
    <p>We all said we were very sorry, and pressed Cummings to stay to supper. Cummings said it was
     like old times being without Lupin, and he was much better away.</p>
    <p><label>July 3, Sunday.</label>—In the afternoon, as I was looking out of the parlour window,
     which was open, a grand trap, driven by a lady, with a gentleman seated by the side of her,
     stopped at our door. Not wishing to be seen, I withdrew my head very quickly, knocking the back
     of it violently against the sharp edge of the window-sash. I was nearly stunned. There was a
     loud double-knock at the front door; Carrie rushed out of the parlour, upstairs to her room,
     and I followed, as Carrie thought it was Mr. Perkupp. I thought it was Mr. Franching. I
     whispered to Sarah over the banisters: "Show them into the drawing-room." Sarah said, as the
     shutters were not opened, the room would smell musty. There was another loud rat-tat. I
     <pb n="290"/> whispered: "Then show them into the parlour, and say Mr. Pooter will be down
     directly." I changed my coat, but could not see to do my hair, as Carrie was occupying the
     glass.</p>
    <p>Sarah came up, and said it was Mrs. Murray Posh and Mr. Lupin.</p>
    <p>This was quite a relief. I went down with Carrie, and Lupin met me with the remark: "I say,
     what did you run away from the window for? Did we frighten you?"</p>
    <p>I foolishly said: "What window?"</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Oh, you know. Shut it. You looked as if you were playing at Punch and Judy."</p>
    <p>On Carrie asking if she could offer them anything, Lupin said: "Oh, I think Daisy will take
     on a cup of tea. I can do with a B. and S."</p>
    <p>I said: "I am afraid we have no soda."</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Don't bother about that. You just trip out and hold the horse; I don't think
     Sarah understands it."</p>
    <p>They stayed a very short time, and as they were leaving. Lupin said: "I want you both to come
     and dine with me next Wednesday, and see my new place. Mr. and Mrs. Murray Posh, Miss Posh
     (Murray's sister) are coming. Eight o'clock sharp. No one else."</p>
    <pb n="291"/>
    <p>I said we did not pretend to be fashionable people, and would like the dinner earlier, as it
     made it so late before we got home.</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Rats! You must get used to it. If it comes to that, Daisy and I can drive you
     home."</p>
    <p>We promised to go; but I must say in my simple mind the familiar way in which Mrs. Posh and
     Lupin address each other is reprehensible. Anybody would think they had been children together.
     I certainly should object to a six months' acquaintance calling <hi>my</hi> wife "Carrie," and
     driving out with her.</p>
    <p><label>July 4.</label>—Lupin's rooms looked very nice; but the dinner was, I thought, a
     little too grand, especially as he commenced with champagne straight off. I also think Lupin
     might have told us that he and Mr. and Mrs. Murray Posh and Miss Posh were going to put on full
     evening dress. Knowing that the dinner was only for us six, we never dreamed it would be a full
     dress affair. I had no appetite. It was quite twenty minutes past eight before we sat down to
     dinner. At six I could have eaten a hearty meal. I had a bit of bread-and-butter at that hour,
     feeling famished, and I expect that partly spoiled my appetite.</p>
    <pb n="292"/>
    <p/>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="pic292"/>


    <p>We were introduced to Miss Posh, whom Lupin called "Lillie Girl," as if he had known her all
     her life. She was very tall, rather plain, and I thought she was a little painted round the
     eyes. I hope I am wrong; but she had such fair hair, and yet her eyebrows were black. She
     looked about thirty. I did not like the way she kept giggling and giving Lupin smacks and
     pinching him. Then her laugh was a sort of a scream that went right through my ears, all the
     more irritating because there was nothing to laugh at. In fact, Carrie and I were not at all
     prepossessed with her. They all smoked cigarettes after dinner, including Miss Posh, who
     startled Carrie by saying: "Don't you smoke, dear?" I answered for Carrie, and said: "Mrs.
     Charles Pooter has not arrived at it yet," whereupon Miss Posh gave one of her piercing laughs
     again.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Posh sang a dozen songs at least, and I can only repeat what I have said before-she does
      <hi>not</hi>
     <pb n="293"/> sing in tune; but Lupin sat by the side of the piano, gazing into her eyes the
     whole time. If I had been Mr. Posh, I think I should have had something to say about it. Mr.
     Posh made himself very agreeable to us, and eventually sent us home in his carriage, which I
     thought most kind. He is evidently very rich, for Mrs. Posh had on some beautiful jewellery.
     She told Carrie her necklace, which her husband gave her as a birthday present, alone cost
     £300.</p>
    <p>Mr. Posh said he had great belief in Lupin, and thought he would make rapid way in the
     world.</p>
    <p>I could not help thinking of the £600 Mr. Posh lost over the <hi>Parachikka Chlorates</hi>
     through Lupin's advice.</p>
    <p>During the evening I had an opportunity to speak to Lupin, and expressed a hope that Mr. Posh
     was not living beyond his means.</p>
    <p>Lupin sneered, and said Mr. Posh was worth thousands. "Posh's one-price hat" was a household
     word in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and all the big towns throughout England. Lupin
     further informed me that Mr. Posh was opening branch establishments at New York, Sydney, and
     Melbourne, and was negotiating for Kimberley and Johannesburgh.</p>
    <pb n="294"/>
    <p>I said I was pleased to hear it.</p>
    <p>Lupin said: "Why, he has settled over £10,000 on Daisy, and the same amount on 'Lillie Girl.'
     If at any time I wanted a little capital, he would put up a couple of 'thou' at a day's notice,
     and could buy up Perkupp's firm over his head at any moment with ready cash."</p>
    <p>On the way home in the carriage, for the first time in my life, I was inclined to indulge in
     the radical thought that money was <hi>not</hi> properly divided.</p>
    <p>On arriving home at a quarter-past eleven, we found a hansom cab, which had been waiting for
     me for two hours with a letter. Sarah said she did not know what to do, as we had not left the
     address where we had gone. I trembled as I opened the letter, fearing it was some bad news
     about Mr. Perkupp. The note was: "Dear Mr. Pooter,-Come down to the Victoria Hotel without
     delay. Important. Yours truly, Hardfur Huttle."</p>
    <p>I asked the cabman if it was too late. The cabman replied that it was <hi>not</hi>; for his
     instructions were, if I happened to be out, he was to wait till I came home. I felt very tired,
     and really wanted to go to bed. I reached the hotel at a quarter before midnight. I apologised
     for being so late, but Mr. Huttle
     <pb n="295"/> said: "Not at all; come and have a few oysters." I feel my heart beating as I
     write these words. To be brief, Mr. Huttle said he had a rich American friend who wanted to do
     something large in our line of business, and that Mr. Franching had mentioned my name to him.
     We talked over the matter. If, by any happy chance, the result be successful, I can more than
     compensate my dear master for the loss of Mr. Crowbillon's custom. Mr. Huttle had previously
     said: "The glorious 'Fourth' is a lucky day for America, and, as it has not yet struck twelve,
     we will celebrate it with a glass of the best wine to be had in the place, and drink good luck
     to our bit of business."</p>
    <p>I fervently hope it will bring good luck to us all.</p>
    <p>It was two o'clock when I got home. Although I was so tired, I could not sleep except for
     short intervals-then only to dream.</p>
    <p>I kept dreaming of Mr. Perkupp and Mr. Huttle. The latter was in a lovely palace with a crown
     on. Mr. Perkupp was waiting in the room. Mr. Huttle kept taking off this crown and handing it
     to me, and calling me "President."</p>
    <p>He appeared to take no notice of Mr. Perkupp, and I kept asking Mr. Huttle to give the crown
     to my worthy master. Mr. Huttle kept saying: "No,
     <pb n="296"/> this is the White House of Washington, and you must keep your crown, Mr.
     President."</p>
    <p>We all laughed long and very loudly, till I got parched, and then I woke up. I fell asleep,
     only to dream the same thing over and over again.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER THE LAST.</head>
    <p>One of the happiest days of my life.</p>
    <p><label>July 10</label>—The excitement and anxiety through which I have gone the last few days
     have been almost enough to turn my hair grey. It is all but settled. To-morrow the die will be
     cast. I have written a long letter to Lupin-feeling it my duty to do so,-regarding his
     attention to Mrs. Posh, for they drove up to our house again last night.</p>
    <p><label>July 11.</label>—I find my eyes filling with tears as I pen the note of my interview
     this morning with Mr. Perkupp. Addressing me, he said: "My faithful servant, I will not dwell
     on the important service you have done our firm. You can never be sufficiently thanked. Let us
     change the subject. Do you like your house, and are you happy where you are?"</p>
    <p>I replied: "Yes, sir; I love my house and I love the neighbourhood, and could not bear to
     leave it."</p>
    <p>Mr. Perkupp, to my surprise, said: "Mr. Pooter, I will purchase the freehold of that house,
     and
