                                                <p>Burleigh-Singleton is a pleasant little
                                                  watering-place on the southern coast of England,
                                                  entirely suitable for those who have small incomes
                                                  and good consciences. The latter, to residents
                                                  especially, are at least as indispensable as the
                                                  former: seeing that, however just the reputation
                                                  of their growing little town for superior
                                                  cheapness in matters of meat and drink, its
                                                  character in things regarding men and manners is
                                                  quite as undeniable for pre-eminent dulness.</p>
                                                <p>Not but that it has its varieties of scene, and
                                                  more or less of circumstances too: there are, on
                                                  one flank, the breezy Heights, with flag-staff and
                                                  panorama; on the other, broad and level
                                                  water-meadows, skirted by the dark-flowing Mullet,
                                                  running to the sea between its tortuous banks: for
                                                  neighbourhood, Pacton Park is one great
                                                  attraction—the pretty market-town of Eyemouth
                                                  another—the everlasting, never-tiring sea a third;
                                                  and, at high-summer, when the Devonshire lanes are
                                                  not knee-deep in mire, the nevertheless

                                                  having called it dull), you may pick up curious
                                                  agate pebbles on the beach, as well as corallines
                                                  and scarce sea-weeds, good for gumming on
                                                  front-parlour windows; you may fish <hi>for</hi>
                                                  whitings in the bay, and occasionally catch them;
                                                  you may wade in huge caoutchouc boots among the
                                                  muddy shallows of the Mullet, and shoot
                                                  <hi>at</hi> cormorants and curlews; you may walk
                                                  to satiety between high-banked and rather dirty
                                                  cross-roads; and, if you will scramble up the
                                                  hedge-row, may get now and then peeps of undulated
                                                  country landscape.</p>
                                                <p>Moreover, you have free liberty to drop in any
                                                  where to "tiffin"—Burleigh being very Indianized,
                                                  and a guest always welcome; indeed, <pb n="15"/>so
                                                  Indianized is it, so populous in jaundiced cheek
                                                  and ailing livers, that you may openly assert,
                                                  without fear of being misunderstood (if you wish
                                                  to vary your common phrase of loyalty), that
                                                  Victoria sits upon the "musnud" of Great Britain;
                                                  you may order curry in the smallest pot-house, and
                                                  still be sure to get the rice well-cooked; you may
                                                  call your house-maid "ayah," without risk of
                                                  warning for impertinence; you may vent your wrath
                                                  against indolent waiters in eloquence of "jaa,
                                                  soostee;" and, finally, you may go to the library,
                                                  and besides the advantage of the
                                                  day-before-yesterday's Times, you may behold in
                                                  bilious presence an affable, but authoritative,
                                                  old gentleman, who introduces himself, "Sir, you
                                                  see in me the hero of Puttymuddyfudgepoor."</p>
                                                <p>You may even now see such an one, I say, and hear
                                                  him too, if you will but go to Burleigh; seeing he
                                                  has by this time over-lived the year or so whereof
                                                  our tale discourses. He has, by dint of service,
                                                  attained to the dignity of General H.E.I.C.S.,
                                                  and—which he was still longer coming to—the wisdom
                                                  of being a communicative creature; though
                                                  possibly, by a natural rëaction, at present he
                                                  carries anti-secresy a little too far, and verges
                                                  on the gossiping extreme. But, at the time to
                                                  which we must look back to commence this
                                                  right-instructive story, General Tracy was still
                                                  drinking "Hodgson's Pale" in India, was so
                                                  taciturn as to be considered almost dumb, and had
                                                  not yet lifted up his yellow visage upon Albion's
                                                  white cliffs, nor taken up head-quarters in his
                                                  final rest of Burleigh-Singleton.</p>
                                                <p>Nevertheless, with reference to quartering at
                                                  Burleigh, a certain long-neglected wife of his,
                                                  Mrs. Tracy, had; and that for the period of at
                                                  least the twenty-one years preceding: how and
                                                  wherefore I proceed to tell.</p>
                                                <p>A common case and common fate was that of Mrs.
                                                  Tracy. She had married, both early and hastily, a
                                                  gallant lieutenant, John George Julian Tracy, to
                                                  wit, the military germ of our future general;
                                                  their courtship and acquaintance previous to
                                                  matrimony extended over the not inconsiderable
                                                  space of three whole weeks—commencing with a
                                                  country ball; and after marriage, honey-moon
                                                  inclusive, they lived the life of cooing doves for
                                                  three whole months.</p>
                                                <p>And now came the furlough's end: Mr. Tracy, in
                                                  his then habitual reserve (a quiet man was he),
                                                  had concealed its existence altogether: and, for
                                                  aught Jane knew, the hearty invalid was to remain
                                                  at home for ever: but months soon slip away; and
                                                  so it came to pass, that on a certain next
                                                  Wednesday he must be on his way back to the
                                                  Presidency of Madras, and—if she will not follow
                                                  him—he must leave her.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="16"/>However, there was a certain old
                                                  relative, one Mrs. Green, a childless widow—rich,
                                                  capricious, and infirm—whom Jane Tracy did not
                                                  wish to lose sight of: her money was well worth
                                                  both watching and waiting for; and the captain,
                                                  whom a lucky chance had now lifted out of the
                                                  lieutenancy, was easily persuaded to forego the
                                                  pleasure of his wife's company till the somewhat
                                                  indefinite period of her old aunt's death.</p>
                                                <p>How far sundry discoveries made in the unknown
                                                  regions of each other's temper reconciled him to
                                                  this retrograding bachelorship, and her to her
                                                  widowhood-bewitched, I will not undertake to say:
                                                  but I will hazard the remark, anti-poor-law though
                                                  it seemeth, that the separation of man and wife,
                                                  however convenient, lucrative, or even mutually
                                                  pleasant, is a dereliction of duty, which always
                                                  deserves, and generally meets, its proper and
                                                  discriminative punishment. Had the young wife
                                                  faithfully performed her Maker's bidding, and left
                                                  all other ties unstrung to cleave unto her lord;
                                                  had she considered a husband's true affections
                                                  before all other wealth, and resolved to share his
                                                  dangers, to solace his cares, to be his blessing
                                                  through life, and his partner even unto death,
                                                  rather than selfishly to seek her own comfort, and
                                                  consult her own interest—the tale of crime and
                                                  sadness, which it is my lot to tell, would never
                                                  have had truth for its foundation.</p>
                                                <p>Ill-matched for happiness though they were,
                                                  however well-matched as to mutual merit, the
                                                  common man of pleasure and the frivolous woman of
                                                  fashion, still the wisest way to fuse their minds
                                                  to union, the likeliest receipt for moral good and
                                                  social comfort, would have been this course of
                                                  foreign scenes, of new faces, sprinkled with a
                                                  seasoning of adventure, hardship, danger, in a
                                                  distant land. Gradually would they have learned to
                                                  bear and forbear; the petty quarrel would have
                                                  been forgotten in the frequent kindness; the
                                                  rougher edges of temper and opinion would
                                                  insensibly have smoothed away; new circumstances
                                                  would have brought out better feelings under
                                                  happier skies; old acquaintances, false friends
                                                  forgotten, would have neutralized old feuds: and,
                                                  by long-living together, though it were perhaps
                                                  amid various worries and many cares, they might
                                                  still have come to a good old age with more than
                                                  average happiness, and more than the common run of
                                                  love. Patience in dutiful enduring brings a sure
                                                  reward: and marriage, however irksome a constraint
                                                  to the foolish and the gay, is still so wise an
                                                  ordinance, that the most ill-assorted couple
                                                  imaginable will unconsciously grow happy, if they
                                                  only remain true to one another, and will learn
                                                  the wisdom always to hope and often to
                                                  forgive.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="17"/>The Tracys, however, overlooked all
                                                  this, and mutual friends (those invariable foes to
                                                  all that is generous and unworldly) smiled upon
                                                  the prudence of their temporary separation. The
                                                  captain was to come home again on furlough in five
                                                  years at furthest, even if the aunt held out so
                                                  long; and this availed to keep his wife in the
                                                  rear-guard; therefore, Mrs. Tracy wiped her eyes,
                                                  bade adieu to her retreating lord in Plymouth
                                                  Sound, and determined to abide, with other
                                                  expectant dames and Asiatic invalided heroes, at

                                                  besides its contiguity to arriving Indiamen, was
                                                  advantageous as being the dwelling-place of
                                                  aforesaid Mrs. Green;—that wealthy, widowed aunt,

                                                  succession: but somehow or other, the regular
                                                  post, in no long time afterwards, became
                                                  unfaithful to its trust; and if Mrs. Jane heard
                                                  quarterly, which at any rate she did through the
                                                  agent, when he remitted her allowance, she
                                                  consoled herself as to the captain's well-being:
                                                  in due course of things, even this became
                                                  irregular; he was far up the country, hunting,
                                                  fighting, surveying, and what not; and no wonder
                                                  that letters, if written at all, which I rather
                                                  doubt, got lost. Then there came a long period of
                                                  positive and protracted silence—months of it—years
                                                  of it; barring that her checks for cash were
                                                  honoured still at Hancock's, though they could
                                                  tell her nothing of her lord; so that Mrs. Tracy
                                                  was at length seriously recommended by her friends
                                                  to become a widow; she tried on the cap, and
                                                  looked into many mirrors; but, after long
                                                  inspection, decided upon still remaining a wife,
                                                  because the weeds were so clearly unbecoming.
                                                  Habit, meanwhile, and that still-existing old
                                                  aunt, who seemed resolved to live to a hundred,
                                                  kept her as before at Burleigh: and, seeing that a
                                                  few months after the captain's departure she had
                                                  presented the world, not to say her truant lord,
                                                  with twins, she had always found something to do
                                                  in the way of, what she considered, education, and
                                                  other juvenile amusement: that is to say, when the
                                                  gayeties of a circle of fifteen miles in radius
                                                  left her any time to spare in such a process. The
                                                  twins—a brace of boys—were born and bred at
                                                  Burleigh, and had attained severally to twenty
                                                  years of age, just before their father came home
                                                  again as brevet-major-general. But both they, and
                                                  that arrival, deserve special detail, each in its
                                                  own chapter.</p>

                                                <p>Mrs. Tracy's sons were as unlike each
                                                  other as it is well possible for two human beings
                                                  to be, both in person and character. Julian, whose
                                                  forward and bold spirit gained him from the very
                                                  cradle every prerogative of eldership (and he did
                                                  struggle first into life, too, so he was the
                                                  first-born), had grown to be a swarthy, strong,
                                                  big-boned man, of the Roman-nosed, or, more
                                                  physiognomically, the Jewish cast of countenance;
                                                  with melo-dramatic elf-locks, large whiskers, and
                                                  ungovernable passions; loud, fierce, impetuous;
                                                  cunning, too, for all his overbearing clamour; and
                                                  an embodied personification of those choice
                                                  essentials to criminal happiness—a hard heart and
                                                  a good digestion. Charles, on the contrary (or, as
                                                  logicians would say, on the contradictory), was
                                                  fair-haired, blue-eyed, of Grecian features; slim,
                                                  though well enough for inches, and had hitherto
                                                  (as the commonalty have it) "enjoyed" weak health:
                                                  he was gentle and affectionate in heart, pure and
                                                  religious in mind, studious and unobtrusive in
                                                  habits. It was a wonder to see the strange
                                                  diversity between those own twin-brothers, born
                                                  within the same hour, and, it is superfluous to
                                                  add, of the same parents; brought up in all
                                                  outward things alike, and who had shared equally
                                                  in all that might be called advantage or
                                                  disadvantage, of circumstance or education.</p>
                                                <p>Certain is it that minds are different at birth,
                                                  and require as different a treatment as Iceland
                                                  moss from cactuses, or bull-dogs from
                                                  bull-finches: certain is it, too, that Julian,
                                                  early submitted and resolutely broken in, would
                                                  have made as great a man, as Charles, naturally
                                                  meek, did make a good one; but for the matter of
                                                  educating her boys, poor Mrs. Tracy had no more
                                                  notion of the feat, than of squaring the circle,
                                                  or determining the longitude. She kept them both
                                                  at home, till the peevish aunt could suffer
                                                  Julian's noise no longer: the house was a
                                                  Pandemonium, and the giant grown too big for that
                                                  castle of Otranto; so he must go at any rate; and
                                                  (as no difference in the treatment of different
                                                  characters ever occurred to any body) of course
                                                  Charles must go along with him. Away they went to
                                                  an expensive school, which Julian's
                                                  insubordination on the instant could not
                                                  brook—and, accordingly, he ran away; without
                                                  doubt, Charles must be taken away too. Another
                                                  school was tried, Julian <pb n="19"/>got expelled
                                                  this time; and Charles, in spite of prizes, must,
                                                  on system, be removed with him: so forth, with
                                                  like wisdom, all through the years of adolescence
                                                  and instruction, those ill-matched brothers were
                                                  driven as a pair. Then again, for fashion's sake,
                                                  and Aunt Green's whims, the circumspective mother,
                                                  notwithstanding all her inconsistencies, gave each
                                                  of them prettily bound hand-books of devotion;
                                                  which the one used upon his knees, and the other
                                                  lit cigars withal; both extremes having exceeded
                                                  her intention: and she proved similarly
                                                  overreached when she persisted in treating both
                                                  exactly alike, as to liberal allowances, and
                                                  liberty of will; the result being, that one of her
                                                  sons "foolishly" spent his money in a multitude of
                                                  charitable hobbies; and that the other was
                                                  constantly supplied with means for (the mother was
                                                  sorry to say it, vulgar) dissipation. By
                                                  consequence, Charles did more good, and Julian
                                                  more evil, than I have time to stop and tell
                                                  off.</p>
                                                <p>If any thing in this life must be personal,
                                                  peculiar, and specific, it is education: we take
                                                  upon ourselves to speak thus dogmatically, not of
                                                  mere school-teaching only, <hi>musa</hi>,
                                                  <hi>musæ</hi>, and so forth; nor yet of lectures,
                                                  on relative qualities of carbon and nitrogen in
                                                  vegetables; no, nor even of schemes of theology,
                                                  or codes of morals; but we do speak of the daily
                                                  and hourly reining-in, or letting-out, of
                                                  discouragement in one appetite, and encouragement
                                                  in another; of habitual formation of characters in
                                                  their diversity; and of shaping their bear's-cub,
                                                  or that child-angel, the natural human mind, to
                                                  its destined ends; that it may turn out, for good,
                                                  according to its several natures, to be either the
                                                  strong-armed, bold-eyed, rough-hewer of God's
                                                  grand designs, or the delicate-fingered polisher
                                                  of His rarest sculptures. Julian, well-trained,
                                                  might have grown to be a Luther; and many a gentle
                                                  soul like Charles, has turned out a coxcomb and a
                                                  sensualist.</p>
                                                <p>The boys were born, as I have said, in the
                                                  regulation order of things, a few months after
                                                  Captain Tracy sailed away for India some full
                                                  score of years, and more, from this present hour,
                                                  when we have seen him seated as a general in the
                                                  library at Burleigh; and, until the last year,
                                                  they had never seen their father—scarcely ever
                                                  heard of him.</p>
                                                <p>The incidents of their lives had been few and
                                                  common-place: it would be easy, but wearisome, to
                                                  specify the orchards and the bee-hives which
                                                  Julian had robbed as a school-boy; the rebellions
                                                  he had headed; the monkey tricks he had played
                                                  upon old fish-women; and the cruel havoc he made
                                                  of cats, rats, and other poor tormented creatures,
                                                  who had ministered to his wanton and brutalizing
                                                  joys. In like <pb n="20"/>manner, wearily, but
                                                  easily, might I relate how Charles grew up the
                                                  nurse's darling, though little of his flaunting
                                                  mother's; the curly-pated young book-worm; the
                                                  sympathizing, innoffensive, gentle heart, whose
                                                  effort still it was to countervail his brother's
                                                  evil: how often, at the risk of blows, had he
                                                  interposed to save some drowning puppy: how often
                                                  paid the bribe for Julian's impunity, when mulcted
                                                  for some damage done in the way of broken windows,
                                                  upset apple-stalls, and the like: how often had he
                                                  screened his bad twin-brother from the
                                                  flagellatory consequences of sheer idleness, by
                                                  doing for him all his school-tasks: how often
                                                  striven to guide his insensate conscience to
                                                  truth, and good, and wisdom: how often, and how
                                                  vainly!</p>
                                                <p>And when the youths grew up, and their good and
                                                  evil grew up with them, it were possible to tell
                                                  you a heart-rending tale of Julian's treachery to
                                                  more than one poor village beauty; and many a
                                                  pleasing trait of Charles's pure benevolence, and
                                                  wise zeal to remedy his brother's mischiefs. The
                                                  one went about doing ill, and the other doing
                                                  good: Julian, on account of obligations, more
                                                  truly than in spite of them, hated Charles; and
                                                  yet one great aim of all Charles's amiabilities
                                                  tended continually to Julian's good, and he strove
                                                  to please him, too, while he wished to bless him.
                                                  The one had grown to manhood, full of unrepented
                                                  sins, and ripe for darker crime: the other had
                                                  attained a like age of what is somewhat
                                                  satirically called discretion, having amassed,
                                                  with Solon of old, "knowledge day by day," having
                                                  lived a life of piety and purity, and blest with a
                                                  cheerful disposition, that teemed with happy
                                                  thoughts.</p>
                                                <p>They had, of course, in the progress of human
                                                  life, been both laid upon the bed of sickness,
                                                  where, with similar contrast, the one lay
                                                  muttering discontent, and the other smiling
                                                  patiently: they had both been in dangers by land
                                                  and by sea, where Julian, though not a little
                                                  lacking to himself at the moment of peril, was
                                                  still loudly minacious till it came too near;
                                                  while Charles, with all his caution, was more
                                                  actually courageous, and in spite of all his
                                                  gentleness, stood against the worst undaunted:
                                                  they had both, with opposite motives and
                                                  dissimilar modes of life, passed through various
                                                  vicissitudes of feeling, scene, society; and the
                                                  influence of circumstance on their different
                                                  characters, heightened or diminished, bettered or
                                                  depraved, by the good or evil principle in each,
                                                  had produced their different and probable
                                                  results.</p>
                                                <p>Thus, strangely dissimilar, the twin-brothers
                                                  together stand before us: Julian the strong
                                                  impersonation of the animal man, as Charles of the
                                                  intellectual; Julian, matter; Charles, spirit;
                                                  Julian, the creature of this <pb n="21"/>world,
                                                  tending to a lower and a worse: Charles, though in
                                                  the world, not of the world, and reaching to a
                                                  higher and a better.</p>
                                                <p>Mrs. Tracy, the mother of this various progeny,
                                                  had been somewhat of a beauty in her day, albeit
                                                  much too large and masculine for the taste of
                                                  ordinary mortals; and though now very considerably
                                                  past forty, the vain vast female was still
                                                  ambitious of compliment, and greedy of admiration.
                                                  That Julian should be such a woman's favourite
                                                  will surprise none: she had, she could have, no
                                                  sympathies with mild and thoughtful Charles; but
                                                  rather dreaded to set her flaunting folly in the
                                                  light of his wise glance, and sought to hide her
                                                  humbled vanity from his pure and keen perceptions.
                                                  His very presence was a tacit rebuke to her social
                                                  dissipation, and she could not endure the mild
                                                  radiance of his virtues. He never fawned and
                                                  flattered her, as Julian would; but had even
                                                  suffered filial presumption (it could not be
                                                  affection—O dear, no!) to go so far as gently to
                                                  expostulate at what he fancied wrong; he never
                                                  gave her reason to contrast, with happy
                                                  self-complacence, her own soul's state with
                                                  Charles's, however she could with Julian's: and
                                                  then, too, she would indulgently allow her foolish
                                                  mind—a woman's, though a parent's—to admire that
                                                  tall, black, bandit-looking son, above the slight
                                                  build, the delicate features, and almost feminine
                                                  elegance of his brother: she found Julian always
                                                  ready to countenance and pamper her gayest wishes,
                                                  and was glad to make him her escort every where—at
                                                  balls, and fêtes, and races, and archery parties;
                                                  while as to Charles, he would be the stay-at-home,
                                                  the milk-sop, the learned pundit, the pious
                                                  prayer-monger, any thing but the ladies' man. Yes:
                                                  it is little wonder that Mrs. Tracy's heart clave
                                                  to Julian, the masculine image of herself; while
                                                  it barely tolerated Charles, who was a rarefied
                                                  and idealized likeness of the absent and forgotten
                                                  Tracy.</p>
                                                <p>But the mother—and there are many silly mothers,
                                                  almost as many as silly men and silly maids—in her
                                                  admiration of the outward form of manliness,
                                                  overlooked the true strength, and chivalry, and
                                                  nobleness of mind which shone supreme in Charles.
                                                  How would Julian have acted in such a case as
                                                  this?—a sheep had wandered down the cliff's face
                                                  to a narrow ledge of rock, whence it could not
                                                  come back again, for there was no room to turn:
                                                  Julian would have pelted it, and set his bull-dog
                                                  at it, and rejoiced to have seen the poor animal's
                                                  frantic leaps from shingly shelf to shelf, till it
                                                  would be dashed to pieces. But how did Charles
                                                  act? With the utmost courage, and caution, and
                                                  presence of mind, he crept down, and, at the risk
                                                  of his life, dragged the bleating, <pb n="22"/>unreluctant creature up again; it really seemed
                                                  as if the ungrateful poor dumb brute recognised
                                                  its humane friend, and suffered him to rescue it
                                                  without a struggle or a motion that might have
                                                  endangered both.</p>
                                                <p>Again: a burly costermonger was belabouring his
                                                  donkey, and the wretched beast fell beneath his
                                                  cudgel: strange to say, Julian and Charles were
                                                  walking together that time; and the same sight
                                                  affected each so differently, that the one sided
                                                  with the cruel man, and the other with his
                                                  suffering victim: Charles, in momentary
                                                  indignation, rushed up to the fellow, wrested the
                                                  cudgel from his hand, and flung it over the cliff;
                                                  while Julian was so base, so cowardly, as to
                                                  reward such generous interference, by holding his
                                                  weaker brother's arms, and inviting the wrathful
                                                  costermonger to expend the remainder of his
                                                  phrensy on unlucky Charles. Yes, and when at home
                                                  Mrs. Tracy heard all this, she was silly enough,
                                                  wicked enough, to receive her truly noble son with
                                                  ridicule, and her other one, the child of her
                                                  disgrace, with approval.</p>
                                                <p>"It will teach you, Master Charles, not to meddle
                                                  with common people and their donkeys; and you may
                                                  thank your brother Julian for giving you a lesson

                                                <p>It would be easy, if need were, to enumerate
                                                  multiplied examples tending towards the same end—a
                                                  large, masculine-featured mother's foolish
                                                  preference of the loud, bold, worldly animal,
                                                  before the meek, kind, noble, spiritual. And the
                                                  results of all these many matters were, that now,
                                                  at twenty years of age, Charles found himself, as
                                                  it were, alone in a strange land, with many common
                                                  friends indeed abroad, but at home no nearer,
                                                  dearer ties to string his heart's dank lyre
                                                  withal; neither mother nor brother, nor any other
                                                  kind familiar face, to look upon his gentleness in
                                                  love, or to sympathize with his affections,
                                                  unapprehended, unappreciated: so—while Mrs. Tracy
                                                  was the showy, gay, and vapid thing she ever had
                                                  been, and Julian the same impetuous mother's son
                                                  which his very nurse could say she knew
                                                  him—Charles grew up a shy and silent youth,
                                                  necessarily reserved, for lack of some one to
                                                  understand him; necessarily chilled, for want of
                                                  somebody to love him.</p>

                                                  Tracy had almost entirely forgotten the fact, that
                                                  she possessed a piece of goods so supererogatory
                                                  as her husband (a property too which her children

                                                  you are to see me so soon, I dare say, especially
                                                  as it is now some years since you will have heard
                                                  from me. The reason is, I have been long in an
                                                  out-of-the-way part of India, where there is
                                                  little communication with Europe, and so you will
                                                  excuse my not writing. We hope to find ourselves
                                                  to-night in Plymouth roads, where I shall get into
                                                  a pilot-boat, and so shall see you to-morrow. You
                                                  may, therefore, now expect your affectionate
                                                  husband,</p>

                                                <p>This loving letter was the most startling event
                                                  that had ever attempted to unnerve Mrs. Tracy; and
                                                  she accordingly managed, for effect and
                                                  propriety's sake, to grow very faint upon the
                                                  spot, whether for joy, or sorrow, or fear of lost
                                                  liberty, or hope of a restored lord, doth not
                                                  appear; she had so long been satisfied with
                                                  receiving quarterly pay from the India agents,
                                                  that she forgot it was an evidence of her
                                                  husband's existence; and, lo! here he was
                                                  returning a general, doubtlessly a magnificent
                                                  moustachioed individual, and she was to be Mrs.
                                                  General! so that when she came completely to
                                                  herself, after that feint of a faint, she was
                                                  thinking of nothing but court-plumes, oriental

                                                  influence: Charles, naturally affectionate, and
                                                  willing to love a hitherto unseen father, felt
                                                  hurt, as well he might, at the "boy, or boys;"
                                                  while Julian, who ridiculed his brother's
                                                  sentimentality, was already fancying that the

                                                <p>Preparations vast were made at once for the
                                                  general's reception; from attic to kitchen was
                                                  sounded the tocsin of his coming. Julian was all
                                                  bustle and excitement, to his mother's joy and
                                                  pride; while Charles merited her wrath by too much
                                                  of his habitual and paternal quietude,
                                                  particularly when he withdrew his forces
                                                  altogether from the loud domestic fray, by
                                                  retreating up-stairs to cogitate and muse, perhaps
                                                  to make a calming prayer or two about all these
                                                  matters of importance. As for Mrs. Tracy herself,
                                                  she was even now, within the first hour of that
                                                  news, busily engaged in collecting cosmetics,
                                                  trinkets, blonde lace, and other female finery,
                                                  resolved to trick herself out like Jezebel, and
                                                  win her lord once more; whilst the pernicious old

                                                  before, grumbled and scolded so much at this
                                                  upsetting of her house, that there was really some
                                                  risk of her altering the will at last, and cutting
                                                  out Jane Tracy after all.</p>
                                                <p>And the morrow morning came, as if it were no
                                                  more than an ordinary Friday, and with it came
                                                  expectancy; and noon succeeded, and with it
                                                  spirits alternately elated and depressed; and
                                                  evening drew in, with heart-sickness and chagrin
                                                  at hopes or prophecies deferred; and night, and
                                                  next morning, and still the general came not. So,
                                                  much weeping at that vexing disappointment, after
                                                  so many pains to please, Mrs. Tracy put aside her
                                                  numerous aids and appliances, and lay slatternly
                                                  a-bed, to nurse a head-ache until noon; and all
                                                  had well nigh forgotten the probable arrival,

                                                  four suddenly rattled up the terrace, and stopped
                                                  at our identical number seven.</p>
                                                <p>Then was there scuffling up, and getting down,
                                                  and making preparation in hot haste; and a stout
                                                  gentleman with a gamboge face descended from the
                                                  chaise, exploding wrath like a bomb-shell, that so
                                                  important an approach had made such slight
                                                  appearance of expectancy: it was disrespectful to
                                                  his rank, and he took care to prove he was
                                                  somebody, by blowing up the very innocent
                                                  post-boys. This accomplished, he gallantly handed
                                                  out after him a pretty-looking miss in her teens.
                                                  Poor Mrs. Tracy, <hi>en papillotes</hi>, looked
                                                  out at the casement like any one but Jezebel
                                                  attired for bewitching, and could have cried for
                                                  vexation; in <pb n="25"/>fact, she did, and passed
                                                  it off for feeling. Aunt Green, whom the general
                                                  at first lovingly saluted as his wife (for the
                                                  poor man had entirely forgotten the uxorial
                                                  appearance), was all in a pucker for deafness,
                                                  blindness, and evident misapprehension of all
                                                  things in general, though clearly pleased, and
                                                  flattered at her gallant nephew's salutation.
                                                  Julian, with what grace of manner he could muster,
                                                  was already playing the agreeable to that pretty
                                                  ward, after having, to the general's great
                                                  surprise, introduced himself to him as his son;
                                                  while Charles, who had rushed into the room,
                                                  warm-heartedly to fling himself into his father's
                                                  arms, was repelled on the spot for his affection:
                                                  General Tracy, with a military air, excused
                                                  himself from the embrace, extending a finger to
                                                  the unknown gentleman, with somewhat of offended
                                                  dignity.</p>
                                                <p>At last, down came the wife: our general at once
                                                  perceived himself mistaken in the matter of Mrs.
                                                  Green; and, coldly bowing to the bedizened dame,
                                                  acknowledged her pretensions with a courteous—</p>

                                                  twenty years ago, and some dull paternal jest
                                                  about this dozen feet of sons, made up the chilly

                                                  which might possibly survive it, was soon snapt by
                                                  paying post-boys, orders after luggage, and
                                                  devouring tiffin.</p>
                                                <p>The only persons who felt any thing at all, were
                                                  Mrs. Tracy, vexed at her dishabille, and mortified
                                                  at so cool a reception of, what she hoped, her

                                                  soothed his grief, as best he might, with
                                                  philosophic fancies: it was so cold, so heartless,
                                                  so unkind a greeting. Romantic youth! how should

                                                <p>It is surprising what a change twenty
                                                  years of a tropical sun can make in the human
                                                  constitution. The captain went forth a
                                                  good-looking, good-tempered man, destitute neither
                                                  of kind feelings nor masculine <pb n="26"/>beauty:
                                                  the general returned bloated, bilious, irascible,
                                                  entirely selfish, and decidedly ill-favoured. Such
                                                  affections as he ever had seemed to have been left
                                                  behind in India—that new world, around which now
                                                  all his associations and remembrances revolved;
                                                  and the reserve (clearly rëproduced in Charles),
                                                  the habit of silence whereof we took due notice in

                                                  perhaps from some oppressive secret, into a
                                                  settled, moody, continuous taciturnity, which made
                                                  his curious wife more vexed at him than ever; for,
                                                  notwithstanding all the news he must have had to
                                                  tell her, the company of John George Julian Tracy
                                                  proved to his long-expectant Jane any thing but
                                                  cheering or instructive. His past life, and
                                                  present feelings, to say nothing of his future
                                                  prospects, might all be but a blank, for any thing
                                                  the general seemed to care: brandy and tobacco, an
                                                  easy chair, and an ordnance map of India, with
                                                  Emily beside him to talk about old times, these
                                                  were all for which he lived: and even the female
                                                  curiosity of a wife, duly authorized to ask
                                                  questions, could extract from him astonishingly
                                                  little of his Indian experiences. As to his
                                                  wealth, indeed, Mrs. Tracy boldly made direct
                                                  inquiry; for Julian set her on to beg for a
                                                  commission, and Charles also was anxious for a
                                                  year or two at college; but the general divulged
                                                  not much: albeit he vouchsafed to both his sons a
                                                  liberally increased allowance. It was only when
                                                  his wife, piqued at such reserve, pettishly
                                                  remarked,</p>
                                                <p>"At any rate, sir, I may be permitted to hope,
                                                  that Miss Warren's friends are kind enough to pay

                                                  imputation on his Indian acquaintances, sternly
                                                  answered,</p>
                                                <p>"You need not be apprehensive, madam; Emily
                                                  Warren is amply provided for." Words which sank
                                                  deep into the prudent mother's mind.</p>
                                                <p>But we must not too long let dock-leaves hide a
                                                  violet; it is high time, and barely courteous now,
                                                  to introduce that beautiful exotic, Emily Warren.
                                                  Her own history, as she will tell it to Charles
                                                  hereafter, was so obscure, that she knew little of
                                                  it certainly herself, and could barely gather
                                                  probabilities from scattered fragments. At
                                                  present, we have only to survey results in a
                                                  superficial manner: in their due season, we will
                                                  dig up all the roots.</p>
                                                <p>No heroine can probably engage our interest or
                                                  sympathy who possesses the infirmity of ugliness:
                                                  it is not in human nature to admire her, and human
                                                  nature is a thing very much to be consulted.
                                                  Moreover, no one ever yet saw an amiable
                                                  personage, who was not so far pleasing, <pb n="27"/>or, in other parlance, so far pretty. I cannot
                                                  help the common course of things; and however
                                                  hackneyed be the thought, however common-place the
                                                  phrase, it is true, nevertheless, that beauty,
                                                  singular beauty, would be the first idea of any
                                                  rational creature, who caught but a glimpse of
                                                  Emily Warren; and I should account it little
                                                  wonder if, upon a calmer gaze, that beauty were
                                                  found to have its deepest, clearest fountain in
                                                  those large dark eyes of heir's.</p>
                                                <p>Aware as I may be, that "large dark eyes" are no
                                                  novelty in tales like this; and famous for rare
                                                  originality as my pen (not to say genius) would
                                                  become, if an attempt were herein made to interest
                                                  the world in a pink-eyed heroine, still I prefer
                                                  plodding on in the well-worn path of pleasant
                                                  beauty; and so long as Nature's bounty continues
                                                  to supply so well the world we live in with large
                                                  dark eyes, and other feminine perfections, our
                                                  Emily, at any rate, remains in fashion; and if she
                                                  has many pretty peers, let us at least not
                                                  peevishly complain of them. A graceful shape is,
                                                  luckily, almost the common prerogative of female
                                                  youthfulness; a dimpled smile, a cheerful, winning
                                                  manner, regular features, and a mass of luxuriant
                                                  brown hair—these all heroines have—and so has
                                                  our's.</p>
                                                <p>But no heroine ever had yet Emily Warren's eyes;
                                                  not identically only, which few can well deny; but
                                                  similarly also, which the many must be good enough
                                                  to grant: and very few heroes, indeed, ever saw
                                                  their equal; though, if any hereabouts object, I
                                                  will not be so cruel or unreasonable as to hope
                                                  they will admit it. At first, full of soft light,
                                                  gentle and alluring, they brighten up to blaze
                                                  upon you lustrously, and fascinate the gazer's
                                                  dazzled glance: there are depths in them that tell
                                                  of the unfathomable soul, heights in them that
                                                  speak of the spirit's aspirations. It is
                                                  gentleness and purity, no less than sensibility
                                                  and passion, that look forth in such strange power
                                                  from those windows of the mind: it is not the mere
                                                  beautiful machine, fair form, and pleasing
                                                  colours, but the heaven-born light of tenderness
                                                  and truth, streaming through the lens, that takes
                                                  the fond heart captive. Charles, for one, could
                                                  not help looking long and keenly into Emily
                                                  Warren's eyes; they magnetized him, so that he
                                                  might not turn away from them: entranced him, that
                                                  he would not break their charm, had he been able:
                                                  and then the long tufted eyelashes droop so softly
                                                  over those blazing suns—that I do not in the least
                                                  wonder at Charles's impolite, perhaps, but still
                                                  natural involuntary stare, and his mute abstracted
                                                  admiration: the poor youth is caught at once, a
                                                  most willing captive—the moth has <pb n="28"/>burnt its wings, and flutters still happily
                                                  around that pleasant warming radiance. How his
                                                  heart yearned for something to love, some being
                                                  worthy of his own most pure affections: and lo!
                                                  these beauteous eyes, true witnesses of this sweet
                                                  mind, have filled him for ever and a day with love
                                                  at first sight.</p>
                                                <p>But gentle Charles was not the only conquest: the
                                                  fiery Julian, too, acknowledged her supremacy,
                                                  bowed his stubborn neck, and yoked himself at
                                                  once, another and more rugged captive, to the
                                                  chariot of her charms. It was Caliban, as well as
                                                  Ferdinand, courting fair Miranda. In his lower
                                                  grade, he loved—fiercely, coarsely: and the same
                                                  passion, which filled his brother's heart with
                                                  happiest aspirations, and pure unselfish
                                                  tenderness towards the beauteous stranger, burnt
                                                  him up as an inward and consuming fire: Charles
                                                  sunned himself in heaven's genial beams, while
                                                  Julian was hot with the lava-current of his own
                                                  bad heart's volcano.</p>
                                                <p>It will save much trouble, and do away with no
                                                  little useless mystery, to declare, at the outset,
                                                  which of these opposite twin-brothers our
                                                  dark-eyed Emily preferred. She was only seventeen
                                                  in years; but an Indian sky had ripened her to
                                                  full maturity, both of form and feelings: and
                                                  having never had any one whom she cared to think
                                                  upon, and let her heart delight in, till Charles
                                                  looked first upon her beauty wonderingly, it is no
                                                  marvel if she unconsciously reciprocated his young
                                                  heart's thought—before ever he had breathed it to
                                                  himself. Julian's admiration she entirely
                                                  overlooked; she never thought him more than
                                                  civil—barely that, perhaps—however he might
                                                  flatter himself: but her heart and eyes were full
                                                  of his fair contrast, the light seen brighter
                                                  against darkness; Charles all the dearer for a
                                                  Julian. Intensely did she love him, as only tropic
                                                  blood can love; intently did she gaze on him, when
                                                  any while he could not see her face, as only those
                                                  dark eyes could gaze: and her mind, all too
                                                  ignorant but greedy of instruction, no less than
                                                  her heart, rich in sympathies and covetous of
                                                  love, went forth, and fed deliciously on the
                                                  intellectual brow, and delicate flushing cheek of
                                                  her noble-minded Charles. Not all in a day, nor a
                                                  week, nor a month, did their loves thus ripen
                                                  together. Emily was a simple child of nature, who
                                                  had every thing to learn; she scarcely knew her
                                                  Maker's name, till Charles instructed her in God's
                                                  great love: the stars were to her only shining
                                                  studs of gold, and the world one mighty plain, and
                                                  men and women soulless creatures of a day, and the
                                                  wisdom of creation unconsidered, and the book of
                                                  natural knowledge close sealed up, till<pb n="29"/> Charles set out before his eager student the
                                                  mysteries of earth and heaven. Oh, those blessed
                                                  hours of sweet teaching! when he led her quick
                                                  delighted steps up the many avenues of science to
                                                  the central throne of God! Oh, those happy
                                                  moments, never to return, when her eyes in gentle
                                                  thankfulness for some new truth laid open to them,
                                                  flashed upon her youthful Mentor, love and
                                                  intelligence, and pleased admiring wonder! Sweet
                                                  spring-tide of their loves, who scarcely knew they
                                                  loved, yet thought of nothing but each other; who
                                                  walked hand in hand, as brother and sister, in the
                                                  flowery ways of mutual blessing, mutual
                                                  dependence: alas, alas! how brief a space can
                                                  love, that guest from heaven, dwell on earth

                                                <p>For Julian soon perceived that Charles
                                                  was no despicable rival. At first, self-flattery,
                                                  and the habitual contempt wherewith he regarded
                                                  his brother, blinded him to Emily's attachment:
                                                  moreover, in the scenes of gayety and the common
                                                  social circle, she never gave him cause to
                                                  complain of undue preferences; readily she leant
                                                  upon his arm, cheerfully accompanied him in
                                                  morning-visits, noon-day walks, and evening
                                                  parties; and if pale Charles (in addition to the
                                                  more regular masters, dancing and music, and other
                                                  pieces of accomplishment) thought proper to bore
                                                  her with his books for sundry hours every day,
                                                  Julian found no fault with that;—the girl was
                                                  getting more a woman of the world, and all for
                                                  him: she would like her play-time all the better
                                                  for such schoolings, and him to be the truant at
                                                  her side.</p>
                                                <p>But when, from ordinary civilities, the coarse
                                                  loud lover proceeded to particular attentions;
                                                  when he affected to press her delicate hand, and
                                                  ventured to look what he called love into her
                                                  eyes, and to breathe silly nothings in her ear—he
                                                  could deceive himself no longer, notwithstanding
                                                  all his vanity; as legibly as looks could write
                                                  it, he read disgust upon her face, and from that
                                                  day forth she shunned him with undisguised
                                                  abhorrence. Poor innocent maid! she little knew
                                                  the man's black mind, who thus dared to reach up
                                                  to the height of her affections; but she saw <pb n="30"/>enough of character in his swart scowling
                                                  face, and loud assuming manners, to make her dread
                                                  his very presence, as a thunder-cloud across her
                                                  summer sky.</p>
                                                <p>Then did the baffled Julian begin to look around
                                                  him, and took notice of her deepening love of
                                                  Charles; nay, even purposely, she seemed now to
                                                  make a difference between them, as if to check
                                                  presumption and encourage merit. And he watched
                                                  their stolen glances, how tremblingly they met
                                                  each other's gaze; and he would often-times
                                                  roughly break in upon their studies, to look on
                                                  their confused disquietude with the pallid frowns
                                                  of envy: he would insult poor Charles before her,
                                                  in hope to humble him in her esteem; but mild and
                                                  Christian patience made her see him as a martyr:
                                                  he would even cast rude slights on her whom he
                                                  professed to love, with the view of raising his
                                                  brother's chastened wrath, but was forced to quail
                                                  and sneak away beneath her quick indignant glance,
                                                  ere her more philosophical lover had time to
                                                  expostulate with the cowardly savage.</p>
                                                <p>Meanwhile, what were the parents about? The
                                                  general had given out, indeed, that he had brought
                                                  Emily over for schooling; but he seemed so fond of
                                                  her (in fact, she was the only thing to prove he
                                                  wore a heart), that he never could resolve upon
                                                  sending her away from, what she now might well
                                                  call, home. Often, in some strange dialect of
                                                  Hindostan, did they converse together, of old
                                                  times and distant shores; none but Emily might
                                                  read him to sleep—none but Emily wake him in the
                                                  morning with a kiss—none but Emily dare approach
                                                  him in his gouty torments—none but Emily had any
                                                  thing like intimate acquaintance with that moody
                                                  iron-hearted man.</p>
                                                <p>As to his sons, or the two young men he might
                                                  presume to be his sons, he neither knew them, nor
                                                  cared to know. Bare civilities, as between man and
                                                  man, constituted all which their intercourse
                                                  amounted to: what were those young fellows, stout
                                                  or slim, to him? mere accidents of a soldier's
                                                  gallantries and of an ill-assorted marriage. He
                                                  neither had, nor wished to have, any sympathies
                                                  with them: Julian might be as bad as he pleased,
                                                  and Charles as good, for any thing the general
                                                  seemed to heed: they could not dive with him into
                                                  the past, and the sports of Hindostan: they
                                                  reminded him, simply, of his wife, for pleasures
                                                  of Memory; of the grave, for pleasures of Hope: he
                                                  was older when he looked at them: and they seemed
                                                  to him only living witnesses of his folly as
                                                  lieutenant, in the choice of Mrs. Tracy. I will
                                                  not take upon myself to say, that he had any
                                                  occasion to congratulate himself on the latter
                                                  reminiscence.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="31"/>So he quickly acquiesced in Julian's
                                                  wish for a commission, and entirely approved of
                                                  Charles's college schemes. After next September,
                                                  the funds should be forthcoming: not but that he
                                                  was rich enough, and to spare, any month in the
                                                  year: but he would be vastly richer then, from
                                                  prize-money, or some such luck. It was more
                                                  prudent to delay until September.</p>
                                                <p>With reference to Emily—no, no—I could see at
                                                  once that General Tracy never had any serious
                                                  intention to part with Emily; but she had all
                                                  manner of masters at home, and soon made
                                                  extraordinary progress. As for the matter of his
                                                  sons falling in love with her, attractive in all
                                                  beauty though she were, he never once had given it
                                                  a thought: for, first, he was too much a man of
                                                  the world to believe in such ideal trash as love:
                                                  and next, he totally forgot that his "boy, or
                                                  boys," had human feelings. So, when his wife one
                                                  day gave him a gentle and triumphant hint of the
                                                  state of affairs, it came upon him overwhelmingly,
                                                  like an avalanche: his yellow face turned
                                                  flake-white, he trembled as he stood, and really
                                                  seemed to take so natural a probability to heart
                                                  as the most serious of evils.</p>
                                                <p>"My son Julian in love with Emily! and if not he,

                                                  believing her intelligence was true, and she could
                                                  see very little cause for regarding it as
                                                  dreadful. True, one son would have been enough for

                                                  before: at the Eyemouth ball, men worshipped her,
                                                  radiant in beauty, and gorgeously apparelled.
                                                  Moreover, money overflowed her purse, her
                                                  work-box, and her jewel-case: Charles's village
                                                  school, and many other well-considered charities,
                                                  rejoiced in the streams of her munificence. The
                                                  general had given her a banker's book of signed
                                                  blank checks, and she filled up sums at pleasure:
                                                  such unbounded confidence had he in her own
                                                  prudence and her far-off father's liberality. The
                                                  few hints her husband deigned to give, encouraged
                                                  Mrs. Tracy to conclude, that she would be a catch
                                                  for either of her sons; and, as for the girl
                                                  herself, she had clearly been brought up to order
                                                  about a multitude of servants, to command the use
                                                  of splendid equipages, and to spend money with
                                                  unsparing hand.</p>
                                                <p>Accordingly, one day when Julian was alone with
                                                  his mother, their conversation ran as follows:</p>
                                                <p>"Well, Julian dear, and what do you think of
                                                  Emily Warren?"</p>
                                                <p>"Think, mother? why—that she's deuced pretty, and
                                                  dresses like an empress: but where did the general
                                                  pick her up, eh?—who is she?"</p>
                                                <p>"Why, as to who she is—I know no more than you;
                                                  she is Emily Warren: but as to the great question
                                                  of what she is, I know that she is rolling in
                                                  riches, and would make one of my boys a very good
                                                  wife."</p>
                                                <p>"Oh, as to wife, mother, one isn't going to be
                                                  fool enough to marry for love now-a-days: things
                                                  are easier managed hereabouts, than that: but
                                                  money makes it quite another thing. So, this
                                                  pretty minx is rich, is she?"</p>
                                                <p>"A great heiress, I assure you, Julian."</p>
                                                <p>"Bravo, bravo-o! but how to make the girl look
                                                  sweet upon me, mother? There's that white-livered
                                                  fellow, Charles—"</p>
                                                <p>"Never mind him, boy; do you suppose he would
                                                  have the heart to make love to such a splendid
                                                  creature as Miss Warren: fy, Julian, for a faint
                                                  heart: Charles is well enough as a Sabbath-school
                                                  teacher, but I hope he will not bear away the palm
                                                  of a ladye-love from my fine high-spirited
                                                  Julian." Poor Mrs. Tracy was as flighty and
                                                  romantic at forty-five as she had been at
                                                  fifteen.</p>
                                                <p>The fine high-spirited Julian answered not a
                                                  word, but looked excessively cross; for he knew
                                                  full well that Charles's chance was to his in the
                                                  ratio of a million to nothing.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="33"/>"What, boy," went on the prudent
                                                  mother, "still silent! I am afraid Emily's good
                                                  looks have been thrown away upon you, and that
                                                  your heart has not found out how to love her."</p>
                                                <p>"Love her, mother? Curses! would you drive me
                                                  mad? I think and dream of nothing but that girl:
                                                  morning, noon, and night, her eyes persecute me:
                                                  go where I will, and do what I will, her image
                                                  haunts me: d——n it, mother' don't I love the
                                                  girl?"</p>
                                                <p>[Oh love, love! thou much-slandered monosyllable,
                                                  how desperately do bad men malign thee!]</p>
                                                <p>"Hush, Julian; pray be more guarded in your
                                                  language; I am glad to see though that your heart
                                                  is in the right place: suppose now that I aid your
                                                  suit a little? I dare say I could do a great deal
                                                  for you, my son; and nothing could be more
                                                  delightful to your mother than to try and make her
                                                  Julian happy."</p>
                                                <p>True, Mrs. Tracy; you were always theatrically
                                                  given, and played the coquette in youth; so in age
                                                  the character of go-between befits you still:
                                                  dearly do you love to dabble in, what you are
                                                  pleased to call, "<hi>une affaire du
                                                  cœur</hi>."</p>
                                                <p>"Mother," after a pause, replied her hopeful
                                                  progeny, "if the girl had been only pretty, I
                                                  shouldn't have asked any body's help; for marriage
                                                  was never to my liking, and folks may have their
                                                  will of prouder beauties than this Emily, without
                                                  going to church for it; but money makes it quite
                                                  another matter: and I may as well have the benefit
                                                  of your assistance in this matter o' money, eh
                                                  mother? matrimony, you know: an heiress and a
                                                  beauty may be worth the wedding-ring; besides,
                                                  when my commission comes, I can follow the good
                                                  example that my parents set me, you know; and,
                                                  after a three months' honey-mooning, can turn
                                                  bachelor again for twenty years or so, as our
                                                  governor-general did, and so leave wifey at home,
                                                  till she becomes a Mrs. General like you."</p>
                                                <p>Now, strange to say, this heartless bit of
                                                  villany was any thing but unpleasing to the
                                                  foolish, flattered heart of Mrs. Tracy; he was a
                                                  chip of the old block, no better than his father:
                                                  so she thanked "dear Julian" for his confidence,
                                                  with admiration and emotion; and looking upwards,
                                                  after the fashion of a Covent Garden martyr,
                                                  blessed him.</p>

                                                  here, Charles, come and change with me; I should
                                                  like a walk with you to Oxton, to see how your
                                                  little scholars get on." So spake the intriguing
                                                  mother.</p>
                                                <p>"Why, that is just what I was going to do with
                                                  Charles," said Emily, "and if Julian will excuse
                                                  me—"</p>
                                                <p>"Oh, never mind me, Miss Warren, pray; come along

                                                <p>So they paired off in more well-matched couples
                                                  (for Julian luckily took huff), and went their
                                                  different ways: with those went hatred, envy,
                                                  worldly scheming, and that lowest sort of love
                                                  that ill deserves the name; with these remain all
                                                  things pure, affectionate, benevolent.</p>
                                                <p>"Charles, dear," (they were just like brother and
                                                  sister, innocent and loving), "how kind it is of

                                                  hurriedly urged her half-avowed lover.</p>
                                                <p>"Oh, don't ask me, Charles—pray drop the
                                                  subject;" and, as she blushed, tears stood in her
                                                  eyes.</p>
                                                <p>Charles bit his lip and clenched his fist
                                                  involuntarily; but an instant word of prayer drove
                                                  away the spirit of hatred, and set up love
                                                  triumphant in its place.</p>
                                                <p>"My Emily—oh, what have I said? may I—may I call
                                                  you my Emily? dearest, dearest girl!" escaped his
                                                  lips, and he trembled at his own presumption. It
                                                  was a presumptuous speech indeed; but it burst
                                                  from the well of his affections, and he could not
                                                  help it.</p>
                                                <p>Her answer was not in words, and yet his
                                                  heart-strings thrilled beneath the melody; for her
                                                  eyes shed on him a blaze of love that made him
                                                  almost faint before them. In an instant, they
                                                  understood, without a word, the happy truth, that
                                                  each one loved the other.</p>
                                                <p>"Precious, precious Emily!" They were now far
                                                  away from Burleigh, in the fields; and he seized
                                                  her hand, and covered it with kisses.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="35"/>What more they said I was not by to
                                                  hear, and if I had been would not have divulged
                                                  it. There are holy secrets of affection, which
                                                  those who can remember their first love—and first
                                                  love is the only love worth mentioning—may think
                                                  of for themselves. Well, far better than my feeble
                                                  pencilling can picture, will they fill up this
                                                  slight sketch. That walk to Oxton, that visit to
                                                  the village school, was full of generous
                                                  affections unrepressed, the out-pourings of two
                                                  deep-welled hearts, flowing forth in sympathetic
                                                  ecstasy. The trees, and fields, and cottages were
                                                  bathed in heavenly light, and the lovers, happy in
                                                  each other's trust, called upon the all-seeing God
                                                  to bless the best affections of His children.</p>
                                                <p>And what a change these mutual confessions made
                                                  in both their minds! Doubt was gone; they
                                                  <hi>were</hi> beloved; oh, richest treasure of
                                                  joy! Fear was gone; they dared declare their love;
                                                  oh, purest river of all sublunary pleasures! No
                                                  longer pale, anxious, thoughtful, worn by the
                                                  corroding care of "Does she—does she
                                                  love?"—Charles was, from that moment, a buoyant,
                                                  cheerful, exhilarated being—a new character; he
                                                  put on manliness, and fortitude, and somewhat of
                                                  involuntary pride; whilst Emily felt, that
                                                  enriched by the affections of him whom she
                                                  regarded as her wisest, kindest earthly friend, by
                                                  the acquisition of his love, who had led her heart
                                                  to higher good than this world at its best can
                                                  give her, she was elevated and ennobled from the
                                                  simple Indian child, into the loved and honoured
                                                  Christian woman. They went on that important walk
                                                  to Oxton feeble, divided, unsatisfied in heart:
                                                  they returned as two united spirits, one in faith,
                                                  one in hope, one in love; both heavenly and
                                                  earthly.</p>
                                                <p>But the happy hour is past too soon; and, home
                                                  again, they mixed once more with those conflicting
                                                  elements of hatred and contention.</p>
                                                <p>"Emily," asked the general, in a very unusual
                                                  stretch of curiosity, "where have you been to with
                                                  Charles Tracy? You look flushed, my dear; what's
                                                  the matter?"</p>
                                                <p>Of course "nothing" was the matter: and the
                                                  general was answered wisely, for love was nothing
                                                  in his average estimate of men and women.</p>
                                                <p>"Charles, what can have come to you? I never saw
                                                  you look so happy in my life," was the mother's
                                                  troublesome inquiry; "why, our staid youth
                                                  positively looks cheerful."</p>
                                                <p>Charles's walk had refreshed him, taken away his
                                                  head-ache, put him in spirits, and all manner of
                                                  glib reasons for rejoicing.</p>
                                                <p>"You were right, Julian," whispered Mrs. Tracy,
                                                  "and we'll soon put the stopper on all this sort
                                                  of thing."</p>
                                                <p><pb n="36"/>So, then, the moment our guiltless
                                                  pair of lovers had severally stolen away to their
                                                  own rooms, there to feast on well-remembered
                                                  looks, and words, and hopes—there to lay before
                                                  that heavenly Friend, whom both had learned to
                                                  trust, all their present joys, as aforetime all
                                                  their cares—Mrs. Tracy looked significantly at
                                                  Julian, and thus addressed her ever stern-eyed
                                                  lord:</p>
                                                <p>"So, general, the old song's coming true to us, I
                                                  find, as to other folks, who once were young
                                                  together: <quote><l>"'And when with envy Time,

                                                  You'll in your girls again be courted, and I'll go
                                                  wooing in my boys.'"</l></quote></p>
                                                <p>So said or sung the flighty Mrs. Tracy. It was as
                                                  simple and innocent a quotation as could possibly
                                                  be made; I suppose most couples, who ever heard
                                                  the stanza, and have grown-up children, have
                                                  thought upon its dear domestic beauty: but it
                                                  strangely affected the irascible old general. He
                                                  fumed and frowned, and looked the picture of
                                                  horror; then, with a fierce oath at his wife and
                                                  sons, he firmly said—</p>
                                                <p>"Woman, hold your fool's tongue: begone, and send
                                                  Emily to me this minute: stop, Mr. Julian—no—run
                                                  up for your brother Charles, and come you all to
                                                  me in the study. Instantly, sir! do as I bid you,
                                                  without a word."</p>
                                                <p>Julian would gladly have fought it out with his
                                                  imperative father; but, nevertheless, it was a
                                                  comfort to have to fetch pale Charles for a
                                                  jobation; so he went at once. And the three young
                                                  people, two of them trembling with affections
                                                  overstrained, and the third indurated in
                                                  effrontery, stood before that stern old man.</p>
                                                <p>"Emily, child,"—and he added something in
                                                  Hindostanee, "have I been kind to you—and do you
                                                  owe me any love?"</p>
                                                <p>"Dear, dear sir, how can you ask me that?" said
                                                  the warm-affectioned girl, falling on her knees in
                                                  tears.</p>
                                                <p>"Get up, sweet child, and hear me: you see those
                                                  boys; as you love me, and yourself, and happiness,
                                                  and honour—dare not to think of either, one
                                                  moment, as your husband."</p>
                                                <p>Emily fainted; Charles staggered to assist her,
                                                  though he well-nigh swooned himself; and Julian
                                                  folded his arms with a resolute air, as waiting to
                                                  hear what next.</p>
                                                <p>But the general disappointed him: he had said his
                                                  say: and, as volatile salts, a lady's maid, and
                                                  all that sort of rëinvigoration, seemed essential
                                                  to Emily's recovery, he rang the bell forthwith:
                                                  so the pleasant family party broke up without
                                                  another word.</p>

                                                <p>Our lovers would not have been
                                                  praiseworthy, perhaps not human, had they not met
                                                  in secret once and again. True, their regularly
                                                  concerted studies were forbidden, and they never
                                                  now might openly walk out unaccompanied: but love
                                                  (who has not found this out?) is both daring and
                                                  ingenious; and notwithstanding all that Emily
                                                  purposed about doing as the general so strangely
                                                  bade her, they had many happy meetings, rich with
                                                  many happy words: all the happier no doubt for
                                                  their stolen sweetness.</p>
                                                <p>There was one great and engrossing subject which
                                                  often had employed their curiosity; who and what
                                                  was Emily Warren? for the poor girl did not know
                                                  herself. All she could guess, she told Charles, as
                                                  he zealously cross-questioned her from time to
                                                  time: and the result of his inquiries would appear
                                                  to be as follows:</p>
                                                <p>Emily's earliest recollections were of great
                                                  barbaric pomp; huge elephants richly caparisoned,
                                                  mighty fans of peacock's tails, lines of matchlock
                                                  men, tribes of jewelled servants, a gilded palace,
                                                  with its gardens and fountains: plenty of rare
                                                  gems to play with, and a splendid queenly woman,
                                                  whom she called by the Hindoo name for mother. The
                                                  general, too, was there among her first
                                                  associations, as the gallant Captain Tracy, with
                                                  his company of native troops.</p>
                                                <p>Then an era happened in her life; a tearful
                                                  leave-taking with that proud princess, who
                                                  scarcely would part with her for sorrow; but the
                                                  captain swore it should be so: and an old
                                                  Scotch-woman, her nurse, she could remember, who
                                                  told her as a child, but whether religiously or
                                                  not she could not tell, "Darling, come to me when
                                                  you wish to know who made you;" and then Mrs.
                                                  Mackie went and spoke to the princess, and soothed
                                                  her, that she let the child depart peacefully.
                                                  Most of her gorgeous jewellery dated from that
                                                  earliest time of inexplicable oriental
                                                  splendour.</p>
                                                <p>After those infantine seven years, the captain
                                                  took her with him to his station up the country,
                                                  where she lived she knew not how long, in a strong
                                                  hill-fort, one Puttymuddyfudgepoor, where there
                                                  was a great deal of fighting, and besieging, and
                                                  storming, and cannonading; but it ceased <pb n="38"/>at last, and the captain, who then soon
                                                  successively became both major and colonel, always
                                                  kept her in his own quarters, making her his
                                                  little pet; and, after the fighting was all over,
                                                  his brother-officers would take her out hunting in
                                                  their howdahs, and she had plenty of
                                                  palanquin-bearers, sepoys, and servants at
                                                  command; and, what was more, good nurse Mackie was
                                                  her constant friend and attendant.</p>
                                                <p>Time wore on, and many little incidents of Indian
                                                  life occurred, which varied every day indeed, but
                                                  still left nothing consequential behind them:
                                                  there were tiger-hunts, and incursions of Scindian
                                                  tribes, and Pindarree chieftains taken captive,
                                                  and wounded soldiers brought into the hospital;
                                                  and often had she and good nurse Mackie tended at
                                                  the sick bed-side. And the colonel had the jungle
                                                  fever, and would not let her go from his sight; so
                                                  she caught the fever too, and through Heaven's
                                                  mercy was recovered. And the colonel was fonder of
                                                  her now than ever, calling her his darling little
                                                  child, and was proud to display her early budding
                                                  beauty to his military friends—pleasant sort of
                                                  gentlemen, who gave her pretty presents.</p>
                                                <p>Then she grew up into womanhood, and saw more
                                                  than one fine uniform at her feet, but she did not
                                                  comprehend those kindnesses: and the general (he
                                                  was general now) got into great passions with
                                                  them, and stormed, and swore, and drove them all
                                                  away. Nurse Mackie grew to be old, and sometimes
                                                  asked her, "Can you keep a secret, child?—no, no,
                                                  I dare not trust you yet: wait a wee, wait a wee,
                                                  my bonnie, bonnie bairn."</p>
                                                <p>And now speedily came the end. The general
                                                  resolved on returning to his own old shores:
                                                  chiefly, as it seemed, to avoid the troublesome
                                                  pertinacity of sundry suitors, who sought of him
                                                  the hand of Emily Warren for, by this name she was
                                                  beginning to be called: in her earliest
                                                  recollection she was Amina; then at the hill-fort,
                                                  Emily—Emily—nothing for years but Emily: and as
                                                  she grew to womanhood, the general bade her sign
                                                  her name to notes, and leave her card at houses,
                                                  as Emily Warren: why, or by what right, she never
                                                  thought of asking. But nurse Mackie had hinted she
                                                  might have had "a better name and a truer;" and
                                                  therefore, she herself had asked the general what
                                                  this hint might mean; and he was so angry that he
                                                  discharged nurse Mackie at Madras, directly he
                                                  arrived there to take ship for England.</p>
                                                <p>Then, just before embarking, poor nurse Mackie
                                                  came to her secretly, and said, "Child, I will
                                                  trust you with a word; you are not what he thinks
                                                  you." And she cried a great deal, and longed to
                                                  come to Eng<pb n="39"/>land; but the general would
                                                  not hear of it; so he pensioned her off, and left
                                                  her at Madras, giving somebody strict orders not
                                                  to let her follow him.</p>
                                                <p>Nevertheless, just as they were getting into the
                                                  boat to cross the surf, the affectionate old soul
                                                  ran out upon the strand, and called to her "Amy
                                                  Stuart! Amy Stuart!" to the general's great
                                                  amazement as clearly as her own; and she held up a
                                                  packet in her hand as they were pushing off, and
                                                  shouted after her, "Child—child! if you would have
                                                  your rights, remember Jeanie Mackie!"</p>
                                                <p>After that, succeeded the monotony of a long sea
                                                  voyage. The general at first seemed vexed about
                                                  Mrs. Mackie, and often wished that he had asked
                                                  her what she meant; however, his brow soon
                                                  cleared, for he reflected that a discarded servant
                                                  always tells falsehoods, if only to make her
                                                  master mischief.</p>
                                                <p>"The voyage over, Charles, with all its cards,
                                                  quadrilles, doubling the cape, crossing the line,
                                                  and the wearisome routine of sky and sea, the

                                                  length in Plymouth Sound; left the Indiaman to go
                                                  up the channel; and I suppose the post-chaise may

                                                <p>In all this there was mystery enough for
                                                  a dozen lovers to have crazed their brains about.
                                                  Emily might be a queen of the East, defrauded of
                                                  hereditary glories, and at any rate deserved such
                                                  rank, if Charles was to be judge; but what was
                                                  more important, if the general had any reason at
                                                  all for his arbitrary mandate prohibiting their
                                                  love, it was very possible that reason was a false
                                                  one.</p>
                                                <p>Meantime, Charles had little now to live for,
                                                  except his dear forbidden Emily, any more than she
                                                  for him. And to peace of mind in both, the
                                                  elucidation of that mystery which hung about her
                                                  birth, grew more needful day by day. At last, one
                                                  summer evening, when they had managed a quiet walk
                                                  upon the sands under the Beacon cliff, Charles
                                                  said abruptly, after some moments of abstraction,
                                                  "Dearest, I am resolved."</p>
                                                <p><pb n="40"/>"Resolved, Charles! what about?" and
                                                  she felt quite alarmed; for her lover looked so
                                                  stern, that she could not tell what was going to
                                                  happen next.</p>
                                                <p>"I'll clear it up, that I will; I only wish I had
                                                  the money."</p>
                                                <p>"Why, Charles, what in the world are you dreaming
                                                  about? you frighten me, dearest; are you ill?
                                                  don't look so serious, pray."</p>
                                                <p>"Yes, Emily, I will; at once too. I'm off to
                                                  Madras by next packet; or, that is to say, would,
                                                  if I could get my passage free."</p>
                                                <p>"My noble Charles, if that were the only
                                                  objection, I would get you all the means; for the
                                                  kind—kind general suffers me to have whatever sums
                                                  I choose to ask for. Only, Charles, indeed I
                                                  cannot spare you; do not—do not go away and leave
                                                  me; there's Julian, too—don't leave me—and you
                                                  might never come back, and—and—" all the remainder
                                                  was lost in sobbing.</p>
                                                <p>"No, my Emmy, we must not use the general's gold
                                                  in doing what he might not wish; it would be
                                                  ungenerous. I will try to get somebody to lend me
                                                  what I want—say Mrs. Sainsbury, or the Tamworths.
                                                  And as for leaving you, my love, have no fears for
                                                  me or for yourself; situated as we are, I take it
                                                  as a duty to go, and make you happier, setting you
                                                  in rights, whatever these may be; and for the
                                                  rest, I leave you in His holy keeping who can
                                                  preserve you alike in body, as in soul, from all
                                                  things that would hurt you, and whose mercy will
                                                  protect me in all perils, and bring me back to you
                                                  in safety. This is my trust, Emmy."</p>
                                                <p>"Dear Charles, you are always wiser and better
                                                  than I am: let it be so then, my best of friends.
                                                  Seek out good nurse Mackie, I can give you many
                                                  clues, hear what she has to say; and may the God
                                                  of your own poor fatherless Emily speed your holy
                                                  mission! Yet there is one thing, Charles; ought
                                                  you not to ask your parents for their leave to go?
                                                  You are better skilled to judge than I can be,
                                                  though."</p>
                                                <p>"Emmy, whom have I to ask? my father? he cares
                                                  not whither I go nor what becomes of me; I hardly
                                                  know him, and for twenty years of my short life of
                                                  twenty-one, scarcely believed in his existence; or
                                                  should I ask my mother? alas—love! I wish I could
                                                  persuade myself that she would wish me back again
                                                  if I were gone; moreover, how can I respect her
                                                  judgment, or be guided by her counsel, whose
                                                  constant aim has been to thwart my feeble efforts
                                                  after truth and wisdom, and to pamper all ill
                                                  growths in my unhappy brother Julian? No, Emily; I
                                                  am a man now, and take my own advice. If a parent
                                                  forbade me, indeed, and reasonably, it would be
                                                  fit to acquiesce; but knowing, as I <pb n="41"/>have sad cause to know, that none but you, my
                                                  love, will be sorry for my absence, as for your
                                                  sake alone that absence is designed, I need take
                                                  counsel only of us who are here present—your own
                                                  sweet eyes, myself, and God who seeth us."</p>
                                                <p>"True—most true, dear Charles; I knew that you
                                                  judged rightly."</p>
                                                <p>"Moreover, Emmy, secresy is needful for the due
                                                  fulfilment of my purpose." (Charles little thought
                                                  how congenial to his nature was that same
                                                  secresy.) "None but you must know where I am, or
                                                  whither I am gone. For if there really is any
                                                  mystery which the general would conceal from us,
                                                  be assured he both could and would frustrate all
                                                  my efforts if he knew of my design. The same ship
                                                  that carried me out would convey an emissary from
                                                  him, and nurse Mackie never could be found by me.
                                                  I must go then secretly, and, for our peace sake,
                                                  soon; how dear to me that embassy will be,
                                                  entirely undertaken in my darling Emmy's
                                                  cause!"</p>

                                                  who has privileged me to be your protector—you are
                                                  safe from any serious vexation; and the moment I
                                                  am gone, fly to my father, tell him openly your
                                                  fears, and he will scatter Julian's insolence to
                                                  the winds of heaven."</p>

                                                  that had weighed it down too heavily. I will trust

                                                  and, hard upon the over-ripe age of eighty-seven,
                                                  seemed likely to drop into the grave—to the
                                                  unspeakable delight of her expectant relatives.
                                                  Sooth to say, niece Jane, the soured and
                                                  long-waiting legatee, had now for years been
                                                  treating the poor old woman very scurvily: she had
                                                  lived too long, and had grown to be a burden;
                                                  notwithstanding that her ample income still kept
                                                  on the <pb n="42"/>house, and enabled the general
                                                  to nurse his own East India Bonds right
                                                  comfortably. But still the old aunt would not die,
                                                  and as they sought not her, nor heir's (quite
                                                  contrary to St. Paul's disinterestedness), she was
                                                  looked upon in the light of an incumbrance, on her
                                                  own property and in her own house. Mrs. Tracy
                                                  longed to throw off the yoke of dependance, and
                                                  made small secret of the hatred of the fetter: for
                                                  the old woman grew so deaf and blind, that there
                                                  could be no risk at all, either in speaking one's
                                                  mind, or in thoroughly neglecting her.</p>
                                                <p>However, now that the harvest of hope appeared so
                                                  near, the legatee renewed her old attentions:
                                                  Death was a guest so very welcome to the house,
                                                  that it is no wonder that his arrival was hourly
                                                  expected with buoyant cheerfulness, and a
                                                  something in the mask of kindliness: but I suspect
                                                  that lamb-skin concealed a very wolf. So, Mrs.
                                                  Tracy tenderly inquired of the doctor, and the
                                                  doctor shook his head; and other doctors came to
                                                  help, and shook their heads together. The patient
                                                  still grew worse—O, brightening prospect!—though,
                                                  now and then, a cordial draught seemed to revive
                                                  her so alarmingly, that Mrs. Tracy affectionately
                                                  urging that the stimulants would be too exciting
                                                  for the poor dear sufferer's nerves, induced Dr.
                                                  Graves to discontinue them. Then those fearful
                                                  scintillations in her lamp of life grew
                                                  fortunately duller, and the nurse was by her
                                                  bed-side night and day; and the old aunt became
                                                  more and more peevish, and was more and more
                                                  spoken of by the Tracy family—in her possible
                                                  hearing, as "that dear old soul"—out of it, "that
                                                  vile old witch."</p>
                                                <p>Charles, to be sure, was an exception in all
                                                  this, as he ever was: for he took on him the
                                                  Christian office of reading many prayers to the
                                                  poor decaying creature, and (only that his father
                                                  would not hear of such a thing) desired to have
                                                  the vicar to assist him. Emily also, full of
                                                  sympathy, and disinterested care, would watch the
                                                  fretful patient, hour after hour, in those long,
                                                  dull nights of pain; and the poor, old, perishing
                                                  sinner loved her coming, for she spoke to her the
                                                  words of hope and resignation. Whether that sweet
                                                  missionary, scarcely yet a convert from her own
                                                  dark creed—(Alas! the Amina had offered unto
                                                  Juggernaut, and Emily of the strong hill-fort had
                                                  scarcely heard of any truer God; and the fair girl
                                                  was a woman-grown before, in her first earthly
                                                  love, she also came to know the mercies Heaven has
                                                  in store for us)—whether unto any lasting use she
                                                  prayed and reasoned with that hard, dried heart,
                                                  none but the Omniscient can tell. Let us hope: let
                                                  us hope; for the fretful voice was stilled, and
                                                  the cloudy forehead brightened, and the hag<pb n="43"/>gard eyes looked cheerfully to meet the
                                                  inevitable stroke of death. Thus in wisdom and in
                                                  charity, in patience and in faith, that gentle
                                                  pair of lovers comforted the dying soul.</p>
                                                <p>However, days rolled away, and Aunt Green
                                                  lingered on still, tenaciously clinging unto life:
                                                  until one morning early, she felt so much better,
                                                  that she insisted on being propped up by pillows,
                                                  and seeing all the household round her bed to
                                                  speak to them. So up came every one, in no small
                                                  hope of legacies, and what the lawyers call
                                                  "<hi>donationes mortis causâ</hi>."</p>
                                                <p>The general was at her bed's-head, with, I am
                                                  ashamed to say, perhaps unconsciously, a
                                                  countenance more ridiculous than lugubrious;
                                                  though he tried to subdue the buoyancy of hope and
                                                  to put on looks of decent mourning; on the other
                                                  side, the long-expectant legatee, Niece Jane,
                                                  prudently concealed her questionable grief behind
                                                  a scented pocket-handkerchief. Julian held
                                                  somewhat aloof, for the scene was too depressing
                                                  for his taste: so he affected to read a
                                                  prayer-book, wrong way up, with his tongue in his
                                                  cheek: Charles, deeply solemnized at the near
                                                  approach of death, knelt at the poor invalid's
                                                  bedside; and Emily stood by, leaning over her,
                                                  suffused in tears. At the further corners of the
                                                  bed, might be seen an old servant or two; and Mrs.
                                                  Green's butler and coachman, each a forty years'
                                                  fixture, presented their gray heads at the bottom
                                                  of the room, and really looked exceedingly
                                                  concerned.</p>
                                                <p>Mrs. Green addressed them first, in her feeble
                                                  broken manner: "Grant—and John—good and
                                                  faithful—thank you—thank you both; and you too,
                                                  kind Mrs. Lloyd, and Sally, and
                                                  nurse—what's-your-name: give them the packets,
                                                  nurse—all marked—first drawer, desk:
                                                  there—there—God bless you—good—faithful."</p>
                                                <p>The old servants, full of sorrow at her
                                                  approaching loss, were comforted too: for a kind
                                                  word, and a hundred pound note a-piece, made
                                                  amends for much bereavement: the sick-nurse found
                                                  her gift was just a tithe of their's, and
                                                  recognised the difference both just and kind.</p>
                                                <p>"Niece Jane—you've waited—long—for—this day: my
                                                  will—rewards you."</p>
                                                <p>"O dear—dear aunt, pray don't talk so; you'll
                                                  recover yet, pray—pray don't:" she pretended to
                                                  drown the rest in sorrow, but winked at her
                                                  husband over the handkerchief.</p>
                                                <p>"Julian!" (the precious youth attempted to look
                                                  miserable, and came as called,) "you will find—I
                                                  have remembered—you, Julian." So he winked, too,
                                                  at his mother, and tried to blubber a "thank
                                                  you."</p>

                                                  mother, let us find the will."</p>
                                                <p>Then the nurse went to close the dim glazed eyes;
                                                  and the other sorrowing domestics slunk away; and
                                                  Charles led Emily out of the chamber of death,
                                                  saddened and shocked at such indecent haste.</p>
                                                <p>Meanwhile, the hopeful trio rummaged every
                                                  drawer—tumbled out the mingled contents of boxes,
                                                  desk, and escritoire—still, no will—no will: and
                                                  at last the nurse, who more than once had
                                                  muttered, "Shame on you all," beneath her breath,
                                                  said,</p>
                                                <p>"If you want the will, it's under her pillow: but
                                                  don't disturb her yet, poor thing!"</p>
                                                <p>Julian's rude hand had already thrust aside the
                                                  lifeless, yielding head, and clutched the will:
                                                  the father and mother—though humbled and
                                                  wonder-stricken at his daring—gathered round him;
                                                  and he read aloud, boldly and steadily to the end,
                                                  though with scowling brow, and many curses
                                                  interjectional:</p>

                                                  Green, make this my last will and testament.
                                                  Forasmuch as my niece, Jane Tracy, has watched and
                                                  waited for my death these two-and-twenty years, I
                                                  leave her all the shoes, slippers, and goloshes,
                                                  whereof I may happen to die possessed: item, I

                                                  all: item, I confirm all the gifts which I intend
                                                  to make upon my death-bed: item, forasmuch as
                                                  General Tracy, my niece's husband, on his return
                                                  from abroad, greeted me with much affection, I
                                                  bequeath and give to him five thousand pounds'
                                                  worth of Exchequer bills, now in my banker's
                                                  hands; and appoint him my sole executor. As to my
                                                  landed property, it will all go, in course of law,
                                                  to my heir, <pb n="45"/>Samuel Hayley, and may he
                                                  and his long enjoy it. And as to the remainder of
                                                  my personal effects, including nine thousand
                                                  pounds bank stock, my Dutch fives, and other
                                                  matters, whereof I may die possessed (seeing that
                                                  my relatives are rich enough without my help), I
                                                  give and bequeath the same, subject as

                                                  set my hand and seal this 13th day of May,

                                                  was Julian's brief epilogue—"General, let's burn

                                                <p>"You can if you please, Mr. Julian," interposed
                                                  the nurse, who had secretly enjoyed all this, "and

                                                  of the three witnesses has the will sealed up in
                                                  copy, and the poor deceased there took pains to
                                                  sign them all, perhaps—"</p>
                                                <p>This settled the affair: and the discomfited
                                                  expectants made a precipitate retreat. As the
                                                  general, however, got vastly more than he
                                                  expected, for his individual merits; and seeing
                                                  that he loved Emily as much as he hated both
                                                  Julian and his wife, he really felt well-pleased
                                                  upon the whole, and took on him the duties of
                                                  executor with cheerfulness. So they buried Aunt

                                                <p>Charles's pocket-book was full of clean
                                                  bank notes, fifteen hundred pounds' worth: it
                                                  contained also a diamond ring, and a lock of
                                                  silvery hair; the latter a proof of affectionate
                                                  sentiment in the kind old soul, that touched him
                                                  at the heart.</p>
                                                <p>"And now, my Emmy, the way is clear to us;
                                                  Providence has sent me this, that I may right you,
                                                  dearest: and it will be wise in us to say nothing
                                                  of our plans. Avoid inquiries—for I did not say
                                                  conceal or falsify facts: but, while none but you,
                                                  love, heed of my departure, and while I go for our
                                                  sakes alone, we need not invite disappointment by
                                                  open-<pb n="46"/>mouthed publicity. To those who
                                                  love me, Emmy, I am frank and free; but with those
                                                  who love us not, there is a wisdom and a justice
                                                  in concealment. They do not deserve confidence,
                                                  who will not extend to us their sympathy. None but
                                                  yourself must know whither I am bound; and, after
                                                  some little search for curiosity's sake, when a
                                                  week is past and gone, no soul will care for me of
                                                  those at home. With you, I will manage to

                                                  Sainsbury, at Oxton: I will prepare her for it.
                                                  She knows my love for you, and how they try to
                                                  thwart us; but even she, however trustworthy, need
                                                  not be told my destination yet awhile, until
                                                  'India' appears upon the post-mark. How glad will
                                                  you be, dearest one, how happy in our secret—to
                                                  read my heart's own thoughts, when I am far
                                                  away—far away, clearing up mine Emmy's cares, and
                                                  telling her how blessed I feel in ministering to
                                                  her happiness!"</p>
                                                <p>Such was the substance of their talk, while

                                                <p>Charles's remaining preparations were simple
                                                  enough, now his purse was flush of money: he
                                                  resolved upon taking from his home no luggage
                                                  whatever: preferring to order down, from an
                                                  outfitting house in London, a regular kit of
                                                  cadet's necessaries, to wait for him at the Europe
                                                  Hotel, Plymouth, on a certain day in the ensuing
                                                  week. So that, burdened only with his Emmy's
                                                  miniature, and his pocket-book of bank notes, he
                                                  might depart quietly some evening, get to Plymouth
                                                  in a prëconcerted way, by chaise or coach, before
                                                  the morrow morning; thence, a boat to meet the
                                                  ship off-shore, and then—hey, for the Indies!</p>
                                                <p>It was as well-devised a scheme as could possibly
                                                  be planned; though its secresy, especially with a
                                                  mother in the case, may be a moot point as to the
                                                  abstract moral thereof: nevertheless, concretely,
                                                  the only heart his so mysterious absence would
                                                  have pained, was made aware of all: then, again,
                                                  secresy had been the atmosphere of his daily life,
                                                  the breath of his education; and he too sorely
                                                  knew his mother would rejoice at the departure,
                                                  and Julian, too—all the more certainly, as both
                                                  brothers were now rivals professed for the hand of
                                                  Emily Warren: as to the general, he might, or he
                                                  might not, smoke an extra cheroot in the
                                                  excitement of his wonder; and if he cared about it
                                                  anyways more tragically than tobacco might betray,
                                                  Emily knew how to comfort him.</p>
                                                <p>With respect to other arrangements, Emmy
                                                  furnished Charles with letters to certain useful
                                                  people at Madras, and in particular to the
                                                  "somebody" who looked after Mrs. Mackie: so, the
                                                  mystery was easy of access, and he doubted not of
                                                  overcoming, on the spot, every unseen dif<pb n="47"/>ficulty. The plan of leaving all luggage
                                                  behind, a capital idea, would enable him to go
                                                  forth freely and unshackled, with an ordinary air,
                                                  in hat and great-coat, as for an evening's walk;
                                                  and was quite in keeping with the natural reserve
                                                  of his whole character—a bad habit of secresy,
                                                  which he probably inherited from his father, the
                                                  lieutenant of old times. And yet, for all the
                                                  wisdom, and mystery, and shrewd settling of the
                                                  plan, its accomplishment was as nearly as possible
                                                  most fatally defeated.</p>
                                                <p>The important evening arrived; for the
                                                  Indiaman—it was our old friend Sir William
                                                  Elphinston—would be off Plymouth, next morning:
                                                  the goods had been, for a day or two, safely
                                                  deposited at the Europe, as per invoice, all paid:
                                                  the lovers, in this last, this happiest, yet by
                                                  far the saddest of their stolen interviews, had
                                                  exchanged vows and kisses, and upon the beach,
                                                  beneath those friendly cliffs, had commended one
                                                  another to their Father in heaven. They had
                                                  returned to the unsocial circle of home; all was
                                                  fixed; the clock struck nine: and Charles,
                                                  accidentally squeezing Emily's hand, rose to leave
                                                  the tea-table.</p>
                                                <p>"Where are you going, Mr. Charles?"</p>
                                                <p>"I am going out, Julian."</p>
                                                <p>"Thank you, sir! I knew that, but whither?
                                                  General, I say, here's Charles going to serenade
                                                  somebody by moonlight."</p>
                                                <p>The brandy-sodden parent, scarcely conscious,
                                                  said something about his infernal majesty; and,
                                                  "What then?—let him go, can't you?"</p>
                                                <p>"Well, Julian dear, perhaps your brother will not
                                                  mind your going with him; particularly as Emily
                                                  stays at home with me."</p>
                                                <p>This Mrs. Tracy spoke archly, intended as a hint
                                                  to induce Julian to remain: but he had other
                                                  thoughts—and simply said, in an ill-tempered tone
                                                  of voice, "Done, Charles."</p>
                                                <p>It was a dilemma for our escaping hero; but
                                                  glancing a last look at Emily, he departed, and
                                                  walked on some way as quietly as might be with
                                                  Julian by his side: thinking, perhaps, he would
                                                  soon be tired; and suffering him to fancy, if he
                                                  would, that Charles was bound either on some
                                                  amorous pilgrimage, or some charitable mission.
                                                  But they left Burleigh behind them—and got upon
                                                  the common—and passed it by, far out of sight and
                                                  out of hearing—and were skirting the high banks of
                                                  the darkly-flowing Mullet—and still there was
                                                  Julian sullenly beside him. In vain Charles had
                                                  tried, by many gentle words, to draw him into
                                                  common conversation: Julian would not speak, or
                                                  only gave utterance to some hinted phrase of
                                                  insult: his brow was even darker than usual, and
                                                  night was coming on apace, and he still tramped
                                                  steadily <pb n="48"/>along beside his brother,
                                                  digging his sturdy stick into the clay, for very
                                                  spite's sake. At length, as they yet walked along
                                                  the river's side in that unfrequented place,
                                                  Julian said, on a sudden, in a low strange tone,
                                                  as if keeping down some rising rage within
                                                  him,</p>
                                                <p>"Mr. Charles, you love Emily Warren."</p>
                                                <p>"Well, Julian, and who can help loving her?"</p>
                                                <p>It was innocently said; but still a maddening
                                                  answer, for he loved her too.</p>
                                                <p>"And, sirrah," the brother hoarsely added,
                                                  "she—she does not—does not—hate you, sir, as I
                                                  do."</p>
                                                <p>"My good Julian, pray do not be so violent; I
                                                  cannot help it if the dear girl loves me."</p>
                                                <p>"But I can, though!" roared Julian, with an oath,
                                                  and lifted up his stick—it was nearer like a
                                                  club—to strike his brother.</p>
                                                <p>"Julian, Julian, what are you about? Good
                                                  Heavens! you would not—you dare not—give
                                                  over—unhand me, brother; what have I done, that
                                                  you should strike me? Oh! leave me—leave
                                                  me—pray."</p>
                                                <p>"Leave you? I will leave you!" the villain almost
                                                  shouted, and smote him to the ground with his
                                                  lead-loaded stick. It was a blow that must have
                                                  killed him, but for the interposing hat, now
                                                  battered down upon his bleeding head. Charles, at
                                                  length thoroughly aroused, though his foe must be
                                                  a brother, struggled with unusual strength in
                                                  self-preserving instinct, wrested the club from
                                                  Julian's hand, and stood on the defensive.</p>
                                                <p>Julian was staggered: and, after a moment's
                                                  irresolution, drawing a pistol from his pocket,
                                                  said, in a terribly calm voice,</p>
                                                <p>"Now, sir! I have looked for such a meeting many
                                                  days—alone, by night, with you! I would not
                                                  willingly draw trigger, for the noise might bring
                                                  down other folks upon us, out of Oxton yonder:
                                                  but, drop that stick, or I fire."</p>
                                                <p>Charles was noble enough, without another word,
                                                  to fling the club into the river: it was not fear
                                                  of harm, but fear of sin, that made him trust
                                                  himself defenceless to a brother, a twin-brother,
                                                  in the dark: he could not be so base, a murderer,
                                                  a fratricide! Oh! most unhallowed thought! Save
                                                  him from this crime, good God! Then,
                                                  instantaneously reflecting, and believing he
                                                  decided for the best, when he saw the ruffian
                                                  glaring on him with exulting looks, as upon an
                                                  unarmed rival at his mercy, with no man near to
                                                  stay the deed, and none but God to see it, Charles
                                                  resolved to seek safety from so terrible a death
                                                  in flight.</p>
                                                <p>Oxton was within one mile; and, clearly, this was
                                                  not like flying from <pb n="49"/>danger as a
                                                  coward, but fleeing from attempted crime, as a
                                                  brother and a Christian. Julian snatched at him to
                                                  catch him as he passed: and, failing in this,
                                                  rushed after him. It was a race for life! and they
                                                  went like the wind, for two hundred yards, along
                                                  that muddy high-banked walk.</p>
                                                <p>Suddenly, Charles slipped upon the clay, that he
                                                  fell; and Julian, with a savage howl, leapt upon
                                                  him heavily.</p>
                                                <p>Poor youth, he knew that death was nigh, and only
                                                  uttered, "God forgive you, brother! oh, spare
                                                  me—or, if not me, spare yourself—Julian,
                                                  Julian!"</p>
                                                <p>But the monster was determined. Exerting the
                                                  whole force of his herculean frame, he seized his
                                                  scarce-resisting victim as he lay, and, lifting
                                                  him up like a child, flung his own twin-brother
                                                  head foremost into that darkly-flowing
                                                  current!</p>
                                                <p>There was one piercing cry—a splash—a struggle;
                                                  and again nothing broke upon the silent night, but
                                                  the murmur of that swingeing tide, as the Mullet
                                                  hurried eddying to the sea.</p>
                                                <p>Julian listened a minute or two, flung some
                                                  stones at random into the river, and then hastily
                                                  ran back to Burleigh, feeling like a Cain.</p>

                                                <p>But the overruling hand of Him whose aid
                                                  that victim had invoked, was now stretched forth
                                                  to save! and the strong-flowing tide, that ran too
                                                  rapidly for Charles to sink in it, was
                                                  commissioned from on High to carry him into an
                                                  angle of that tortuous stream, where he clung by
                                                  instinct to the bushes. Silence was his wisdom,
                                                  while the murderer was near: and so long as
                                                  Julian's footsteps echoed on the banks, Charles
                                                  stirred not, spoke not, but only silently thanked
                                                  God for his wonderful deliverance. However, the
                                                  footsteps quickly died away, though heard far off
                                                  clattering amid the still and listening night; and
                                                  Charles, thankfully, no less than cautiously, drew
                                                  himself out of the stream, very little harmed
                                                  beyond a drenching: for the waters had recovered
                                                  him at once from the effects of that desperate
                                                  blow.</p>
                                                <p>It was with a sense of exultation, freedom,
                                                  independence, that he now <pb n="50"/>hastened
                                                  scatheless on his way; dripping garments mattered
                                                  nothing, nor mud, nor the loss of his demolished
                                                  hat: the pocket-book was safe, and Emmy's
                                                  portrait, (how he kissed it, then!) and luckily a
                                                  travelling cap was in his great-coat pocket: so
                                                  with a most buoyant feeling of animal delight, as
                                                  well as of religious gratitude, he sped merrily
                                                  once more upon his secret expedition. Thank
                                                  Heaven! Emmy could not know the peril he had past:
                                                  and wretched Julian would now have dreadful reason
                                                  of his own for this mysterious absence: and it was
                                                  a pleasant thing to trudge along so freely in the
                                                  starlight, on the private embassy of love. Happy
                                                  Charles! I know not if ever more exhilarated
                                                  feelings blessed the youth; they made him trip
                                                  along the silent road, in a gush of joyfulness, at
                                                  the rate of some six miles an hour; I know not if
                                                  ever such delicious thoughts of Emily's
                                                  attachment, and those gorgeous mysteries in India,
                                                  of adventure, enterprise, escape, had heretofore
                                                  caused his heart to bound so lightsomely within
                                                  him, like some elastic spring. I know not if ever
                                                  strong reliance upon Providential care, more
                                                  earnest prayers, praises, intercessions (for poor
                                                  Julian, too,) were offered on the altar of his
                                                  soul. Happy Charles!</p>
                                                <p>So he went on and on—long past Oxton, and
                                                  Eyemouth, and Surbiton, and over the ferry, and
                                                  through the sleeping turnpikes, and past the
                                                  bridge, and along the broad high-road, until gray
                                                  of morning's dawn revealed the suburbs of
                                                  Plymouth.</p>
                                                <p>Of course he missed the mail by which he intended
                                                  to have gone—for Julian's dread act delayed
                                                  him.</p>
                                                <p>Long before his journey's end, his clothes were
                                                  thoroughly dried, and violent exercise had shaken
                                                  off all possible rheumatic consequence of that
                                                  fearful plunge beneath the waters: five-and-twenty
                                                  miles in four hours and three-quarters, is a
                                                  tolerable recipe for those who have tumbled into
                                                  rivers. We must recollect that he had gone as
                                                  quick as he could, for fear of being late, now the
                                                  coach had passed. At a little country inn, he
                                                  brushed, and washed, and made toilet as well as he
                                                  was able, took a glass of good Cognac, both hot
                                                  and strong; and felt more of a man than ever.</p>
                                                <p>Then, having loitered awhile, and well-remembered
                                                  Emily in his prayers, at about eight in the
                                                  morning he presented himself among his luggage at
                                                  the Europe in gentlemanly trim, and soon got all
                                                  on board the pilot boat, to meet the Indiaman just
                                                  outside the breakwater. We may safely leave him
                                                  there, happy, hopeful Charles! Sanguine for the
                                                  future, exulting in the present, and thankful for
                                                  the past: already has <pb n="51"/>he poured out
                                                  all his joys before that Friend who loves her too,
                                                  and invoked His blessing on a scheme so well
                                                  designed, so providentially accomplished.</p>
                                                <p>I had almost forgotten Julian: wretched, hardened
                                                  man, and how fared he? The moment he had flung his
                                                  brother into that dark stream, and the waters
                                                  closed above him greedily that he was gone—gone
                                                  for ever, he first threw in stones to make a noise
                                                  like life upon the stream, but that cheatery was
                                                  only for an instant: he was alone—a murderer,
                                                  alone! the horrors of silence, solitude, and
                                                  guilt, seized upon him like three furies: so his
                                                  quick retreating walk became a running; and the
                                                  running soon was wild and swift for fear; and ever
                                                  as he ran, that piercing scream came upon the wind
                                                  behind, and hooted him: his head swam, his eyes
                                                  saw terrible sights, his ears heard terrible
                                                  sounds—and he scoured into quiet, sleeping
                                                  Burleigh like a madman. However, by some strange
                                                  good luck, not even did the slumbering watchman
                                                  see him: so he got in-doors as usual with the
                                                  latch-key (it was not the first time he had been
                                                  out at night), crept up quietly, and hid himself
                                                  in his own chamber.</p>
                                                <p>And how did he spend those hours of guilty
                                                  solitude? in terrors? in remorse? in misery? Not
                                                  he: Julian was too wise to sit and think, and in
                                                  the dark too; but he lit both reading lamps to
                                                  keep away the gloom, and smoked and drank till
                                                  morning's dawn to stupify his conscience.</p>
                                                <p>Then, to make it seem all right, he went down to
                                                  breakfast as usual, though any thing but sober,
                                                  and met unflinchingly his mother's natural
                                                  question—</p>
                                                <p>"Good morning, Julian—where's Charles?"</p>
                                                <p>"How should I know, mother; isn't he up yet?"</p>
                                                <p>"No, my dear; and what is more, I doubt if he
                                                  came home last night."</p>
                                                <p>"Hollo, Master Charles! pretty doings these, Mr.
                                                  Sabbath-teacher! so he slept out, eh, mother?"</p>
                                                <p>"I don't know—but where did you leave him,
                                                  Julian?"</p>
                                                <p>"Who! I? did I go out with him? Oh! yes, now I
                                                  recollect: let's see, we strolled together midway
                                                  to Oxton, and, as he was going somewhat further,
                                                  there I left him?"</p>
                                                <p>How true the words, and yet how terribly false
                                                  their meaning!</p>
                                                <p>"Dear me, that's very odd—isn't it, general?"</p>
                                                <p>"Not at all, ma'am—not at all; leave the lad
                                                  alone, he'll be back by dinner-time: I didn't
                                                  think the boy had so much spirit."</p>
                                                <p>Emily, to whom the general's hint was Greek,
                                                  looked up cheerfully and in her own glad mind
                                                  chuckled at her Charles's bold adventure.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="52"/>But the day passed, off, and they
                                                  sent out men to seek for him: and another—and all
                                                  Burleigh was a-stir: and another—and the
                                                  coast-guards from Lyme to Plymouth Sound searched
                                                  every hole and corner: and another—when his mother
                                                  wept five minutes: and another—when the wonder was
                                                  forgotten.</p>
                                                <p>However, they did not put on mourning for the
                                                  truant: he might turn up yet: perhaps he was at
                                                  Oxford.</p>
                                                <p>Emily had not much to do in comforting the
                                                  general for his dear son's loss; it clearly was a
                                                  gain to him, and he felt far freer than when
                                                  wisdom's eye was on him. Charles had been too keen
                                                  for father, mother, and brother; too good, too
                                                  amiable: he saw their ill, condemned it by his
                                                  life, and showed their dark too black against his
                                                  brightness. The unnatural deficiency of mother's
                                                  love had not been overrated: Julian had all her
                                                  heart; and she felt only obliged to the decamping
                                                  Charles for leaving Emily so free and clear to his
                                                  delightful brother. She never thought him dead:
                                                  death was a repulsive notion at all times to her:
                                                  no doubt he would turn up again some day. And
                                                  Julian joked with her about that musty proverb "a
                                                  bad penny."</p>
                                                <p>As to our dear heroine, she never felt so happy
                                                  in all her life before as now, even when her
                                                  Charles had been beside her; for within a day of
                                                  his departure he had written her a note full of
                                                  affection, hope, and gladness; assuring her of his
                                                  health, and wealth, and safe arrival on board the
                                                  Indiaman. The noble-hearted youth never said one
                                                  single word about his brother's crime: but he did
                                                  warn his Emmy to keep close beside the general.
                                                  This note she got through Mrs. Sainsbury; that
                                                  invalid lady at Oxton, who never troubled herself
                                                  to ask or hear one word beyond her own little
                                                  world—a certain physic-corner cupboard.</p>
                                                <p>And thou—poor miserable man—thou fratricide in
                                                  mind—and to thy best belief in act, how drags on
                                                  now the burden of thy life? For a day or two,
                                                  spirits and segars muddled his brain, and so kept
                                                  thoughts away: but within a while they came on him
                                                  too piercingly, and Julian writhed beneath those
                                                  scorpion stings of hot and keen remorse: and when
                                                  the coast-guards dragged the Mullet, how that
                                                  caitiff trembled! and when nothing could be found,
                                                  how he wondered fearingly! The only thing the
                                                  wretched man could do, was to loiter, day after
                                                  day, and all day long, upon the same high path
                                                  which skirts the tortuous stream. Fascinated there
                                                  by hideous recollections, he could not leave the
                                                  spot for hours: and his soft-headed, romantic
                                                  mother, noticing these deep abstractions, blessed
                                                  him—for her Julian was now in love with Emily.</p>

                                                <p>Ay—in love with Emily! Fiercely now did
                                                  Julian pour his thoughts that way; if only hoping
                                                  to forget murder in another strong excitement.
                                                  Julian listened to his mother's counsels; and that
                                                  silly, cheated woman playfully would lean upon his
                                                  arm, like a huge, coy confidante, and fill his
                                                  greedy ears (that heard her gladly for very
                                                  holiday's sake from fearful apprehensions), with
                                                  lover's hopes, lover's themes, his Emily's
                                                  perfection. Delighted mother—how proud and pleased
                                                  was she! quite in her own element, fanning dear
                                                  Julian's most sentimental flame, and scheming for
                                                  him interviews with Emily.</p>
                                                <p>It required all her skill—for the girl clung
                                                  closely to her guardian: he, unconscious Argus,
                                                  never tired of her company; and she, remembering
                                                  dear Charles's hint, and dreading to be left alone
                                                  with Julian, would persist to sit day after day at
                                                  her books, music, or needle-work in the study,
                                                  charming General Tracy by her pretty Hindoo songs.
                                                  With him she walked out, and with him she came in;
                                                  she would read to him for hours, whether he snored
                                                  or listened; and, really, both mother and son were
                                                  several long weeks before their scheming could
                                                  come to any thing. A <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> between
                                                  Julian and Emily appeared as impossible to manage,
                                                  as collision between Jupiter and Vesta.</p>
                                                <p>However, after some six weeks of this sort of
                                                  mining and counter-mining (for Emily divined their
                                                  wishes), all on a sudden one morning the general
                                                  received a letter that demanded his immediate
                                                  presence for a day or two in town; something about
                                                  prize-money at Puttymuddyfudgepoor. Emily was too
                                                  high-spirited, too delicate in mind, to tell her
                                                  guardian of fears which never might be realized;
                                                  and so, with some forebodings, but a cheerful
                                                  trust, too, in a Providence above her, she saw the
                                                  general off without a word, though not without a
                                                  tear; he too, that stern, close man, was moved: it
                                                  was strange to see them love each other so.</p>
                                                <p>The moment he was gone, she discreetly kept her
                                                  chamber for the day, on plea of sickness; she had
                                                  cried very heartily to see him leave her—he had
                                                  never yet left her once since she could
                                                  recollect—and thus she really had a head-ache, and
                                                  a bad one.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="55"/>Julian Tracy gave such a start, that
                                                  he knocked off a cheffonier of rare china and
                                                  glass standing at his elbow; and the smash of
                                                  mandarins and porcelain gods would have been
                                                  enough, at any other time, to have driven his
                                                  mother crazy.</p>
                                                <p>"Charles alive?" shouted he.</p>
                                                <p>"Yes, Julian—why not? You saw him off, you know:
                                                  cannot you remember?"</p>
                                                <p>Now to that guilty wretch's mind the fearful
                                                  notion instantaneously occurred, that Emily Warren
                                                  was in some strange, wild way bantering him; she
                                                  knew his dreadful secret—"he <hi>had</hi> seen him
                                                  off." He trembled like an aspen as she looked on
                                                  him.</p>
                                                <p>"Oh yes, he remembered, certainly; but—but where
                                                  was her letter?"</p>
                                                <p>"Never mind that, Julian; you surely would not
                                                  read another person's letters, Monsieur le
                                                  Chevalier Bayard?"</p>
                                                <p>Emily was as gay at heart that morning as a
                                                  sky-lark, and her innocent pleasantry proved her
                                                  strongest shield. Julian dared not ask to see the
                                                  letter—scarcely dared to hope she had one, and yet
                                                  did not know what to think. As to any love scene
                                                  now, it was quite out of the question,
                                                  notwithstanding all his mother's hints and
                                                  management; a new exciting thought entirely filled
                                                  him: was he a Cain, a fratricide, or not? was
                                                  Charles alive after all? And, for once in his
                                                  life, Julian had some repentant feelings; for
                                                  thrilling hope was nigh to cheer his gloom.</p>
                                                <p>It really seemed as if Emily, sweet innocent,
                                                  could read his inmost thoughts. "At any rate,"
                                                  observed she, playfully, "Bayard may take the
                                                  postman's privilege, and see the outside."</p>
                                                <p>With that, she produced the ship-letter that had
                                                  put her in such spirits, legibly dated some
                                                  twenty-two days ago. Yes, Charles's hand, sure
                                                  enough! Julian could swear to it among a thousand.
                                                  And he fainted dead away.</p>
                                                <p>What an astonishing event! how Mrs. Tracy praised
                                                  her noble-spirited boy! How the bells rang! and
                                                  hot water, and cold water, and salts, and
                                                  rubbings, and <hi>eau de Cologne</hi>, and all
                                                  manner of delicate attentions, long sustained, at
                                                  length contributed to Julian's restoration.
                                                  Moreover, even Emily was agreeably surprised; she
                                                  had never seen him in so amiable a light before;
                                                  this was all feeling, all affection for his
                                                  brother—her dear—dear Charles. And when Mrs. Tracy
                                                  heard what Emily said of Julian's feeling heart,
                                                  she became positively triumphant; not half so much
                                                  at Charles's safety, and all that, as at Julian's
                                                  burst of feeling. She was quite right, after all;
                                                  he was worthy to be her favour<pb n="56"/>ite, and
                                                  she felt both flattered and obliged to him for
                                                  fainting dead away. "Yes—yes, my dear Miss Warren,
                                                  depend upon it Julian has fine feelings, and a
                                                  good heart." And Emily began to condemn both
                                                  Charles and herself for lack of charity, and to
                                                  think so too.</p>

                                                  the day had begun to wear away (so great a shock
                                                  had that intelligence of Charles been to his
                                                  guilty mind), than the gratified and prudent
                                                  mother fancied this a famous opportunity to leave
                                                  the young couple to themselves. It was after
                                                  dinner, when they had retired to the drawing-room;
                                                  and I will say that Emily had never seemed so
                                                  favourably disposed towards that rough, but
                                                  generous, heart before. So then, on some
                                                  significant pretence, well satisfied her favourite
                                                  was himself again, as bold, and black, and
                                                  boisterous as ever, the masculine mother kissed
                                                  her hand to them, as a fat fairy might be supposed
                                                  to do, and operatically tripped away, coyly
                                                  bidding Emily "take care of Julian till she should
                                                  come back again."</p>
                                                <p>The momentary gleam of good which glanced across
                                                  that bad man's heart has faded away hours ago; his
                                                  repentant thoughts had been occasioned more from
                                                  the sudden relief he experienced at running now no
                                                  risks for having murdered, than for any better
                                                  feeling towards his brother, or any humbler
                                                  notions of himself. Nay, a strong rëaction
                                                  occurred in his ideas the moment he had seen his
                                                  brother's writing; and when he fainted, he fainted
                                                  from the struggle in his mind of manifold exciting
                                                  causes, such as these:—hatred, jealousy, what he
                                                  called love, though a lower name befitted it, and
                                                  vexation that his brother was—not dead. Oh mother,
                                                  mother! if your poor weak head had but been wise
                                                  enough to read that heart, would you still have
                                                  loved it as you do? Alas—it is a deep lesson in
                                                  human nature this—she would! for Mrs. General
                                                  Tracy was one of those obstinate, yet superficial
                                                  characters, whom no reason can convince that they
                                                  are wrong, no power can oblige to confess
                                                  themselves mistaken. She rejoiced to hear him
                                                  called "her <pb n="57"/>very image;" and
                                                  predominant vanity in the large coquette extended
                                                  to herself at second-hand; self was her idol
                                                  substance, and its delightful shadow was this
                                                  mother's son.</p>
                                                <p>The moment Mrs. Tracy left the room, Julian
                                                  perceived his opportunity: Charles, detested
                                                  rival, far away at sea; the guardian gone to
                                                  London; Emily in an unusual flow of affability and
                                                  kindness, and he—alone with her. Rashly did he
                                                  bask his soul in her delicious beauty,
                                                  deliberately drinking deep of that intoxicating
                                                  draught. Giving the rein to passion, he suffered
                                                  that tumultuous steed to hurry him whither it
                                                  would, in mad unbridled course. He sat so long
                                                  silently gazing at her with the lack-lustre eyes
                                                  of low and dull desire, that Emily, quite thrown
                                                  off her guard by that amiable fainting for his
                                                  brother, addressed him in her innocent
                                                  kind-heartedness,</p>
                                                <p>"Are you not recovered yet, dear Julian?"</p>
                                                <p>The effect was instantaneous: scarcely crediting
                                                  his ears that heard her call him "dear," his eyes,
                                                  that saw her winning smile upon him, he started
                                                  from his chair, and trembling with agitation,
                                                  flung himself at her feet, to Emily's unqualified
                                                  astonishment.</p>
                                                <p>"Why, Julian, what's the matter?—unhand me, sir!
                                                  let go!" (for he had got hold of her wrist.)</p>
                                                <p>The passionate youth seized her hand—that one
                                                  with Charles's ring upon it—and would have kissed
                                                  it wildly with polluting lips, had she not
                                                  shrieked suddenly "Help! help!"</p>
                                                <p>Instantly his other hand was roughly dashed upon
                                                  her mouth—so roughly that it almost knocked her
                                                  backwards—and the blood flowed from her wounded
                                                  lip; but by a preternatural effort, the indignant
                                                  Indian queen hurled the ruffian from her, flew to
                                                  the bell, and kept on ringing violently.</p>
                                                <p>In less than half a minute all the household was
                                                  around her, headed by the startled Mrs. Tracy, who
                                                  had all the while been listening in the other
                                                  drawing-room: butler, footmen, house-maids,
                                                  ladies'-maids, cook, scullions, and all rushed in,
                                                  thinking the house was on fire.</p>
                                                <p>No need to explain by a word. Emily, radiant in
                                                  imperial charms, stood, like inspired Cassandra,
                                                  flashing indignation from her eyes at the cowering
                                                  caitiff on the floor. The mother, turning all
                                                  manner of colours, dropped on her knees to "poor
                                                  Julian's" assistance, affecting to believe him
                                                  taken ill. But Emily Warren, whose insulted pride
                                                  vouchsafed not a word to that guilty couple, soon
                                                  undeceived all parties, by addressing the butler
                                                  in a voice tremulous and broken—</p>

                                                <p>"Marguerite!"—the pretty little Française tripped
                                                  up to her—"wipe this blood from my face."</p>
                                                <p>Beautiful, insulted creature! I thought that I
                                                  looked upon some wounded Boadicea, with her
                                                  daughters extracting the arrow from her cheek.</p>

                                                  follow me to Prospect House, with what I may
                                                  require for the night. Till the general's return,

                                                <p>Then, without a syllable, or a look of

                                                  braveries, the lines of matchlock men, the bowing
                                                  slaves, the processions, and her jewelled state of
                                                  old—marched away in magnificent beauty,
                                                  accompanied in silence by the whole astonished

                                                <p>Mrs. Tracy and her son were left alone: the
                                                  silly, silly mother thought him "hardly used."
                                                  Julian, whose natural effrontery had entirely
                                                  deserted him, looked like what he was—a guilty
                                                  coward: and the mother, who had pampered up her
                                                  "fine high-spirited son" to his full-grown
                                                  criminality by a foolish education, really—when
                                                  she had time to think of any thing but him—was
                                                  excessively frightened. The general would be back
                                                  to-morrow, and then—and then!—she dreaded to
                                                  picture that explosion of his wrath.</p>

                                                <p>Sir Abraham Tamworth, G.C.B.—a fine old
                                                  Admiral of the White, who somewhat looked down
                                                  upon the rank of General, H.E.I.C.S.—was
                                                  astonished, as well he might be, at Mr. Saunders,
                                                  and his message: and, of course, most gladly
                                                  acquiesced in acting as poor Emily's protector.
                                                  Accordingly, however jealous Lady Tamworth and her
                                                  daughters might heretofore have felt of that
                                                  bright beauty at the balls, they were now all
                                                  genuine sympathy, indignation, and affection.
                                                  Emily, I need hardly say, went straight up stairs
                                                  to have her cry out.</p>
                                                <p>"Whom are you writing to, George, in such a
                                                  hurry?" asked the admiral, of a fine moustachioed
                                                  son, George St. Vincent Tamworth, of the Royal
                                                  Horse Guards, who had just got six months' leave
                                                  of absence for the sake of marriage with his
                                                  cousin.</p>
                                                <p>The gallant soldier tossed a billet to his
                                                  father, who mounted his spectacles, and quietly
                                                  read it at the lamp.</p>
                                                <p>"Captain Tamworth desires Mr. Julian Tracy's

                                                  the third meadow on the Oxton road. The captain
                                                  brings a friend with him; also pistols and a
                                                  surgeon; and he desires Mr. Tracy to do the like:

                                                <p>"So, George, you consider him a gentleman, do
                                                  you? I am afraid it's a poor compliment to our
                                                  fair young friend." And he quietly crumpled up the
                                                  challenge in his iron hand.</p>
                                                <p>"Really, sir!—you surprise me;—pardon me, but I
                                                  will send that note: mustn't I chastise the fellow
                                                  for this insufferable outrage?"</p>
                                                <p>"No doubt, George, no doubt of it at all: when a

                                                  officer) stands by without taking notice of it, he
                                                  deserves whipping at the cart's-tail, and Coventry

                                                  when a woman's in the case. Let a man show moral
                                                  courage, if he can and will, in his own affront; I

                                                  personal insult, and only wish my own old blood
                                                  was cool enough to do so: but the mother, wife,
                                                  and sister, ay, George, and the poor defenceless

                                                  how much the admiral was given to prosing.
                                                  However, the oration soon proceeded to our
                                                  captain's entire satisfaction, after his
                                                  progenitor had paused awhile for breath's sake in
                                                  his eloquence.</p>
                                                <p>"—Take up their quarrel, or we are not men.
                                                  Nevertheless, boy, I cannot see the need of
                                                  pistols. The only conceivable case for violent
                                                  redress, is woman's wrong: and he who wrongs a
                                                  woman, cannot be a gentleman; therefore, ought not
                                                  to be met on equal terms. For other causes of
                                                  duello, as hot-headed speeches, rudenesses, or
                                                  slights, forgive, forbear to fan the flame, and
                                                  never be above apologizing: but in an outrage such
                                                  as this, let a fine-built fellow, such as you are,

                                                <p>"Agreed, agreed, sir!" replied the well-pleased
                                                  son, and her ladyship too vouchsafed her
                                                  approbation.</p>
                                                <p>Emily had gone to bed long ago, or rather to her
                                                  chamber; where the three Misses Tamworth had been
                                                  all kindness, curiosity, and consolation. So, Sir

                                                  followed their example of retirement: and the

                                                  morning at number seven, Mrs. Tracy and her son
                                                  were "not at home:" and of course it would be far
                                                  too Julian-like a proceeding, for true gentleman
                                                  to think of forcing their company on the probably
                                                  ensconced in-dwellers. Accordingly, they marched
                                                  away, without having deigned to leave a card; the
                                                  captain taking on himself the duty of
                                                  perambulating sentinel, while his father proceeded
                                                  to the library as usual. Judge of the glad

                                                  advanced to meet them; and, just after passing his
                                                  father, with whom he exchanged a very comfortable
                                                  glance, discovered that the heroic Julian, who had
                                                  caught a glimpse of the ill-concealed weapon, was
                                                  slinking quickly round a corner to avoid him. It
                                                  was certainly undignified to run, but the gallant
                                                  captain did run, nevertheless and soon caught the
                                                  coward by the collar.</p>

                                                  and the well-thronged plebeian market-place; lash,
                                                  lash, lash, in furious and fast succession on the
                                                  writhing roaring culprit; to the universal
                                                  excoriation of Mr. Julian Tracy, and the amazement
                                                  of an admiring and soon-collected crowd—the rank,
                                                  beauty, and fashion—of Burleigh Singleton. Julian
                                                  was strong indeed, and a coal-heaver in build, but
                                                  conscience had unnerved him; and the coarse noisy
                                                  bully always is a coward: therefore, it was a
                                                  pleasant thing to see how easy came the captain's
                                                  work to him—he had nothing to do but to lash,
                                                  lash, lash, double-thonged, like a slave-driver:
                                                  and, except that he made the caitiff move along,

                                                  spread them forth before the public gaze.
                                                  Doubtless, they were all things tender, warm, and
                                                  eloquent; doubtless, they were tinted rosy hue,
                                                  with love's own blushes, and made glorious with
                                                  the golden light of unaffected piety. I only read
                                                  them myself in a reflected way, by looking into
                                                  Emily's eyes; and I saw, from their ever-changing
                                                  radiance, how feelingly he told of his affections;
                                                  how fervently he poured out all his heart upon the
                                                  page; how evidently tears and kisses had made many
                                                  words illegible; how wise, sanguine, happy, and
                                                  religious, was her own devoted Charles.</p>

                                                  is far too short for all such petty details: and,
                                                  more pointedly, a wire-drawn book is the just
                                                  abhorrence of a generous public.</p>
                                                <p>The letters came frequently: for Charles did
                                                  little else all day but write to Emmy, so as
                                                  always to be ready with a budget for the next
                                                  piece of luck—a home-bound ship. He had many
                                                  things to teach her yet, sweet student; and it was
                                                  a beautiful sight to see how her mind expanded as
                                                  an opening flower before the sun of tenderness and
                                                  wisdom. Each letter, both in writing and in
                                                  reading, was the child of many prayers: and even
                                                  the loveliness of Emily grew more soft, more
                                                  elevated, "as it had been the face of an angel,"
                                                  when feeding in solitary joy on those effusions of
                                                  her lover's heart.</p>
                                                <p>Of course, he could not hear from her, until the
                                                  overland mail might haply bring him letters at
                                                  Madras: so that, as our Irish friends would say,
                                                  with all her will to tell him of her love, "the
                                                  reciprocity must needs be all on one side." But
                                                  Emily did write too; earnestly, happily: and
                                                  poured her very heart out in those eloquent
                                                  burning words. I dare say Charles will get the
                                                  letter now within a day or two: for the roaring
                                                  surf of Madras is on the horizon, almost within
                                                  sight.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="63"/>Nevertheless, before he gets there,
                                                  and can read those letters—precious, precious
                                                  manuscripts—it will be my painful duty, as a
                                                  chronicler of (what might well be) truth, to put
                                                  the reader in possession of one little hint, which
                                                  seemed likeliest to wreck the happiness of these
                                                  two children of affection.</p>
                                                <p>I am Emily's invisible friend: and as the dear
                                                  girl ran to me one morning, with tears in her
                                                  eyes, to ask me what I thought of a certain
                                                  mysterious paragraph, I need not scruple to lay it
                                                  straight before the reader.</p>
                                                <p>At the end of a voluminous love-letter, which I
                                                  really did not think of prying into, occurred the
                                                  following postscript, evidently written at the
                                                  last moment of haste.</p>
                                                <p>"Oh! my precious Emmy, I have just heard the most
                                                  fearful rumour of ill that could possibly befall
                                                  us: the captain of our ship—you will remember
                                                  Captain Forbes, he knew you and the general well,
                                                  he said—has just assured me that—that—! I dare
                                                  not, cannot write the awful words. Oh! my own
                                                  Emmy—Heaven grant you be my own!—pray, pray, as I
                                                  will night and day, that rumour be not true: for
                                                  if it be, my love, both God and man forbid us ever
                                                  to meet again! How I wish I could explain it all,
                                                  or that I had never heard so much, or never
                                                  written it here, and told it you, though thus
                                                  obscurely: for I can't destroy this letter now,
                                                  the ships are just parting company, and there is
                                                  no time to write another. Yet will I hope, love,
                                                  against hope. Who knows? through God's good mercy,
                                                  it may all be cleared up still. If not—if

                                                <p>"Perhaps—O, glorious thought!—Nurse Mackie may
                                                  know better than the captain, after all; and yet,
                                                  he seems so positive: if he is right, there is

                                                <p>Now, to say plain truth, when Emily showed me
                                                  this, I looked very blank upon it. That Charles
                                                  had heard some meddlesome report, which (if true)
                                                  was to be an insuperable barrier to their future
                                                  union, struck me at a glimpse. But I had not the
                                                  heart to hint it to her; and only encouraged
                                                  hope—hope, in God's help, through the means of
                                                  Mrs. Mackie and her papers.</p>
                                                <p>As for the poor girl herself, she asked me, in
                                                  much humility, and with many sobs, if I did not
                                                  fear that her Hindoo mystery was this:—she was the
                                                  vilest of the vile, a Pariah, an outcast, whose
                                                  very presence is contamination!</p>
                                                <p><pb n="64"/>Beautiful, loving, heavenly-hearted
                                                  creature! so humble in the midst of her majestic
                                                  loveliness! how touching was the thought, that she
                                                  thus readily acquiesced in any the deepest
                                                  humiliation holy Providence had seen fit to send
                                                  her; and though the sentence would have crushed
                                                  her happiness for ever, till the day of death,
                                                  that she could still look up and say, "Be it to

                                                <p>As I had no better method of explaining the
                                                  matter, and as her infantine reminiscences and
                                                  prejudices about caste were strong, I even let her
                                                  think so, if she would: it was a far better
                                                  alternative than my own sad thoughts about the
                                                  business: and, however painful was the process, it
                                                  was something consolatory to observe, that this
                                                  voluntary humiliation mellowed and chastened her
                                                  own character, subduing tropical fires, and
                                                  tempering the virgin gold by meekness.</p>

                                                  gossiping Captain Forbes spoke falsely: it is a

                                                  some who really do not deserve them. And if a rich

                                                  creature, General Tracy came back on Friday night.
                                                  He had met with marvellous prosperity; for
                                                  Hancock's had been paying off the prize-money; and
                                                  his own lion's share, as general, in the easy

                                                  rajahs and nabobs, amounted to something like four
                                                  lacs of rupees, nearly half a crore! Such a flush

                                                  exhilarated the bilious old gentleman so

                                                  enough, he had brought his wife as a <pb n="65"/>present Maurice's '<hi>Antiquities of

                                                  so superfluous as to purchase a new pair of
                                                  double-barrelled pistols for Julian: the lad was a
                                                  fine young fellow after all, and ought to be
                                                  encouraged in snuffing out a candle; as for
                                                  Emily's <hi>petit cadeau</hi>, it was a fifty
                                                  guinea set of cameos, the choicest in their way
                                                  that Howell and James's had to show him. Moreover,
                                                  he had sent a Bow-street officer to Oxford, to
                                                  make inquiries after Charles: actually, good
                                                  fortune had made him at once humanized and
                                                  happy.</p>
                                                <p>So the chaise rattled up, and the general bounded
                                                  out, and flew into the arms of his wondering wife,
                                                  as Paris might have flown to Helen, or Leander to
                                                  his heroine—the only feminine Hero, whom grammar
                                                  recognises. It was past eleven at night: therefore
                                                  he did not think to ask for Julian; no doubt the
                                                  boy was gone to bed.</p>
                                                <p>Indeed, he had; and was tossing his wealed body,
                                                  full of pains, and aches, and bruises, as softly
                                                  as he could upon the feather-bed: he had need of
                                                  poultices all over, and a quart of Friar's Balsam
                                                  would have done him little good: after his
                                                  well-merited thrashing, the flogged hound had
                                                  slunk to his kennel, and locked himself sullenly
                                                  in, without even speaking to his mother.
                                                  Tobacco-fumes exuded from the key-hole, and I
                                                  doubt not other creature-comforts lent the muddled
                                                  man their aid.</p>
                                                <p>However, after the first rush of news to Mrs.
                                                  Tracy, her lord, who had every moment been
                                                  expecting the door to fly open, and Emily to fall
                                                  into his arms—for strangely did they love each
                                                  other—suddenly asked,</p>

                                                  befallen the child? Speak—speak, woman!"</p>
                                                <p>"Dear—dear—Oh! what shall I say?" sobbed the
                                                  silly mother. "Emily—Emily, poor dear Julian—"</p>
                                                <p>"What the devil, ma'am, of Julian?" The general
                                                  turned white as a sheet, and rang the bell, in
                                                  singular calmness; probably for a dram of brandy.
                                                  Saunders answered it so instantly, that I rather
                                                  suspect he was waiting just outside.</p>
                                                <p>The moment Mrs. Tracy saw the gray-headed butler,
                                                  anticipating all that he might say, she brushed
                                                  past him, and hurriedly ran up-stairs.</p>
                                                <p>"What's all this, Mr. Saunders? where's Miss
                                                  Warren?" And the poor old guardian seemed ready to
                                                  faint at his reply: but he heard it out
                                                  patiently.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="66"/>"I am very sorry to say, general,

                                                  Sir Abraham Tamworth's: but she's well, sir, and

                                                  saw, was Miss Emily pulling at the bell-rope with
                                                  blood upon her face, and Mr. Julian on the floor:

                                                <p>The father arose sternly; his first feeling was
                                                  to kill Julian; but the second, a far better one,
                                                  predominated—he must go and see Emily at once.</p>

                                                  older,) proceeded to the square, and knocked up
                                                  Sir Abraham at midnight, and the admiral came
                                                  down, half asleep, in dressing-gown and slippers,
                                                  vexed at having been knocked up from his warm
                                                  berth so uncomfortably: it put him sorely in
                                                  remembrance of his hardships as a middy.</p>
                                                <p>"Kind neighbour, thank you, thank you; where's

                                                  lived: and the white-haired veteran, suffered
                                                  himself to be led away directly from the landing,
                                                  like a child, by his sympathizing neighbour.</p>
                                                <p>"My heart is lighter now, Sir Abraham: but I am a
                                                  poor weak old man, and owe you an explanation for
                                                  this outburst; some day—some day, not now. O, if
                                                  you could guess how I have nursed that pretty babe
                                                  when alone in distant lands; how I have doated on
                                                  her little winning ways, and been gladdened by the
                                                  music of her prattle; how I have exulted to behold
                                                  her loveliness gradually expanding, as she was
                                                  ever at my side, in peril as in peace, in camp as
                                                  in quarters, in sickness as in health,
                                                  still—still, the blessed angel of a bad man's
                                                  life—a wicked, hard old man, kind neighbour—if you
                                                  knew more—more, than for her sake I dare tell
                                                  you—and if you could conceive the love my Emmy
                                                  bears for me, you would not think it strange—think
                                                  it strange—" He could not say a syllable more; and
                                                  the admiral, with Mr. Saunders, too, who joined
                                                  them in the study, looked very little able to
                                                  console that poor old man. For they all had
                                                  hearts, and trickling eyes to tell them.</p>

                                                  in Sir Abraham's study—for the guardian would not
                                                  leave his dear one ever again—Saunders went home,
                                                  purposing to attend with razors in the
                                                  morning.</p>

                                                <p>The Tamworths did not altogether live at
                                                  Burleigh Singleton—it was far too petty a place
                                                  for them; dullness all the year round (however
                                                  pleasant for a month or so, as a holiday from
                                                  toilsome pleasures) would never have done for Lady
                                                  Tamworth and her daughters: but they regularly
                                                  took Prospect House for six weeks in the summer
                                                  season, when tired of Portland Place, and
                                                  Huntover, their fine estate in Cheshire: and so,
                                                  from constant annual immigration, came as much to
                                                  be regarded Burleighites, as swifts and swallows
                                                  to be ranked as British birds. I only hint at this
                                                  piece of information, for fear any should think it
                                                  unlikely, that grandees of Sir Abraham's condition
                                                  could exist for ever in a place where the
                                                  day-before-yesterday's '<hi>Times</hi>' is first
                                                  intelligence.</p>
                                                <p>Moreover, as another interjectional touch, it is
                                                  only due to my life-likenesses to record, that
                                                  Mrs. Green's, although a terrace-house, and ranked
                                                  as humble number seven, was, nevertheless, a
                                                  tolerably spacious mansion, well suited for the
                                                  dignity of a butler to repose in: for Mrs. Green
                                                  had added an entire dwelling on the inland side,
                                                  as, like most maritime inhabitants, she was
                                                  thoroughly sick of the sea, and never cared to
                                                  look at it, though living there still, from mere
                                                  disinclination to stir: so, then, it was quite a
                                                  double house, both spacious and convenient. As for
                                                  the inglorious incident of Julian's latch-key, I
                                                  should not wonder if many wide street-doors to
                                                  many marble halls are conscious of similar
                                                  convenient fastenings, if gentlemen of Julian's
                                                  nocturnal tastes happen to be therein dwelling.
                                                  Another little matter is worth one word. The house
                                                  had been Mrs. Green's, a freehold, and was,
                                                  therefore, now her heir's; but the general, as an
                                                  executor, remained there still, until his business
                                                  was finished; in fact, he took his year's
                                                  liberty.</p>
                                                <p>He had returned from India rolling in gold; for
                                                  some great princess or other—I think they called
                                                  her a Begum or a Glumdrum, or other such like
                                                  Gulliverian appellative—had been singularly fond
                                                  of him, and had loaded him in early life with
                                                  favours—not only kisses, and so forth, but
                                                  jewellery and gold pagodas. And lately, as we
                                                  know, Puttymuddyfudgepoor, with its radiating
                                                  rajahs and nabobs, had proved a mine of wealth:
                                                  for a crore is ten lacs, and a lac of rupees is
                                                  any thing but a <pb n="69"/>lack of money—although
                                                  rupees be money, and the "middle is distributed;"
                                                  in spite of logic, then, a lack means about twelve
                                                  thousand pounds: and four of them, according to
                                                  Cocker, some fifty thousand. It would appear then,
                                                  that with the produce of the Begum's diamonds,
                                                  converted into money long ago, and some of them as
                                                  big as linnet's eggs—and not to take account of
                                                  Mrs. Green's trifling pinch of the five Exchequer
                                                  bills, all handed over at once to Emily—the
                                                  General's present fortune was exactly one hundred
                                                  and twenty-three thousand pounds.</p>
                                                <p>Of course, <hi>he</hi> wasn't going to bury
                                                  himself at Burleigh Singleton much longer; and
                                                  yet, for all that stout intention of houses and
                                                  lands, and carriages and horses, in almost any
                                                  other county or country, it is as true as any
                                                  thing in this book, that he was a resident still,
                                                  a lease-holder of Aunt Green's house, long after
                                                  the <hi>dénouement</hi> of this story; in many
                                                  things an altered man, but still identical in one;
                                                  the unchangeable resolve (though never to be
                                                  executed) of leaving Burleigh at farthest by next
                                                  Michaelmas. Most folks who talk much, do little;
                                                  and taciturn as the general now is, and has been
                                                  ever throughout life, it will surprise nobody who
                                                  has learned from hard experience how silly and
                                                  harmful a thing is secresy (exceptionables
                                                  excepted), to find that he grew to be a garrulous
                                                  old man, gossipping for ever of past, present,
                                                  future, and, not least, about his deeds at
                                                  Puttymuddyfudgepoor.</p>
                                                <p>General Tracy is by this time awake again; if
                                                  ever indeed he slept on that uncomfortable
                                                  shakedown; and, after Mr. Saunders and the
                                                  razor-strop, has greeted brightly-beaming Emily
                                                  with more than usual tenderness. Her account of
                                                  the transaction made his very blood boil;
                                                  especially as her pretty pouting lips were
                                                  lacerated cruelly inside: that rude blow on the
                                                  mouth had almost driven the teeth through them.
                                                  How confidingly she told her artless tale; how
                                                  gently did her fond protector kiss that poor pale
                                                  cheek; and how sternly did he vow full vengeance
                                                  on the caitiff! Not even Emily's intercession
                                                  could avail to turn his wrath aside. He could
                                                  hardly help flying off at once to do something
                                                  dreadful; but common courtesy to all the Tamworth
                                                  family obliged him to defer for an hour all the
                                                  terrible things he meant to do. So he began to
                                                  bolt his breakfast fiercely as a cannibal, and
                                                  saluted Lady Tamworth and her daughters with such
                                                  savage looks, that the captain considerately
                                                  suggested:</p>
                                                <p>"Here, general," (handing him a most formidable
                                                  carving-knife,) "charge that boar's head, grinning
                                                  defiance at us on the side-board; it will do you
                                                  good to hew his brawny neck. My mother, I am sure,
                                                  for <pb n="70"/>one, will thank you to do the
                                                  honours there instead of me. Isn't it a comfort
                                                  now, to know that I broke the handle of my
                                                  hunting-whip across the fellow's back, and wore
                                                  all the whip-cord into skeins. Come, I say,
                                                  general, don't eat us all round; and pray have
                                                  mercy on that poor, flogged, miserable
                                                  sinner."</p>
                                                <p>This banter did him good, especially as he saw
                                                  Emily smiling; so he relaxed his knit brow,
                                                  condescended to look less like Giant Blunderbore,
                                                  soon became marvellous chatty, and ate up two
                                                  French rolls, an egg, some anchovies, a round of
                                                  toast, and a mighty slice of brawn; these, washed
                                                  down with a couple of cups of tea, soothed him
                                                  into something like complacency.</p>

                                                <p>Long before the general got home, still
                                                  in exalted dudgeon (indeed soon after the general
                                                  had left home over night), the bird had flown; for
                                                  the better part of valour suggested to our evil
                                                  hero, that it would be discreet to render himself
                                                  a scarce commodity for a season; and as soon as
                                                  ever his mother had run up to his room-door to
                                                  tell him of his danger, when her lord was
                                                  cross-questioning the butler, he resolved upon
                                                  instant flight. Accordingly, though sore and
                                                  stiff, he hurried up, dressed again, watched his
                                                  father out, and tumbling over Mrs. Tracy, who was
                                                  sobbing on the stairs, ran for one moment to the
                                                  general's room; there he seized a well-remembered
                                                  cash-box, and instinctively possessed himself of
                                                  those new, neat, double-barrelled pistols: a bully
                                                  never goes unarmed. These brief arrangements made,
                                                  off he set, before his father could have time to
                                                  return from Pacton Square.</p>
                                                <p>Therefore, when the general called, we need not
                                                  marvel that he found him not; no one but the
                                                  foolish mother (so neglected of her son, yet still
                                                  excusing him) stood by to meet his wrath. He would
                                                  not waste it on her; so long as Julian was gone,
                                                  his errand seemed accomplished; for all he came to
                                                  do was to expel him from the house. So, as far as
                                                  regarded Mrs. Tracy, her husband, wotting well how
                                                  much she was to blame, merely commanded her to
                                                  change her sleeping-room, and occupy Mr. Julian's
                                                  in future.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="71"/>The silly woman was even glad to do
                                                  it; and comforted herself from time to time with
                                                  prying into her own boy's exemplary manuscripts,
                                                  memoranda of moralities, and so forth; with
                                                  weeping, like Lady Constance, over his empty
                                                  "unpuffed" clothes; with reading ever and anon his
                                                  choice collection of standard works, among which
                                                  '<hi>Don Juan</hi>' and Mr. Thomas Paine were by
                                                  far the most presentable; and with tasting, till
                                                  it grew to be a habit, his private store of
                                                  spirituous liquors. Thus did she mourn many days
                                                  for long-lost Julian.</p>
                                                <p>I am quite aware what became of him. The wretched
                                                  youth, mad for Emily's love, and tortured by the
                                                  tyranny of passion, had nothing else to live for
                                                  or to die for. He accordingly took refuge in the
                                                  hovel of a smuggler, an old friend of his, not
                                                  many miles away, disguised himself in fisherman's
                                                  costume, and bode his opportunity.</p>
                                                <p>Beauteous girl! how often have I watched thee
                                                  with straining eyes and aching heart, as thou
                                                  wentest on thy summer's walk so oftentimes to
                                                  Oxton, there to exercise thy bountiful benevolence
                                                  in comforting the sick, gladdening the wretched,
                                                  and lingering, with love's own look, in Charles's
                                                  village school; how often have I prayed, that
                                                  guardian angels might be about thy path as about
                                                  thy bed! For the prowling tiger was on thy track,
                                                  poor innocent one, and many, many times nothing
                                                  but one of God's seeming accidents hath saved
                                                  thee. Who was that strange man so often in the
                                                  way? At one time a wounded Spanish legionist, with
                                                  head bound up; at another, an old beggar upon
                                                  crutches; at another, a floury miller with a
                                                  donkey and a sack; at another, a black looking
                                                  man, in slouching sailor's hat and
                                                  fishing-boots?</p>
                                                <p>Fair, pure creature! thou hast often dropped a
                                                  shilling in that beggar's hand, and pitied that
                                                  poor maimed soldier; once, too, a huge gipsy woman
                                                  would have had thee step aside, and hear thy
                                                  fortunes. Heaven guarded thee then, sweet Emily;
                                                  for both girl and lover though thou art, thou
                                                  would'st not listen to the serpent's voice,
                                                  however fair might be the promises. And Heaven
                                                  guarded thee ever, bidding some one pass along the
                                                  path just as the ruffian might have gagged thy
                                                  smiling mouth, and hurried thee away amongst his
                                                  fellows; and more than once, especially, those
                                                  school children, bursting out of Charles's school
                                                  at dusk, have unconsciously escorted thee in
                                                  safety from the perils of that tiger on thy
                                                  track.</p>

                                                <p>The general could not now be kept in
                                                  ignorance of Charles's expedition; in fact, he had
                                                  found his heart, and began resolutely to use it.
                                                  So, the very day on which he had lost Julian, he
                                                  intended very eagerly to seek out Charles; for the
                                                  Oxford search had failed, and no wonder. Now,
                                                  though Emily had told, as we well know, to both
                                                  mother and son her secret, the father was not
                                                  likely to be any the wiser; for he now never spoke
                                                  to his wife, and could not well speak to his son.
                                                  However, one day, an hour after an overland
                                                  letter, a very exhilarating one, dated Madras,

                                                <p>"Dearest sir, you are often thinking of poor lost
                                                  Charles, I know; and you are very anxious about
                                                  him too, though nobody but myself, who am always
                                                  with you, can perceive it: what if you heard he
                                                  was safe and well?"</p>
                                                <p>"Have you heard any tidings of my poor boy,
                                                  Emmy?"</p>
                                                <p>She looked up archly, and said, "Why not?" her
                                                  beautiful eyes adding, as plainly as eyes could
                                                  speak, "I love him, and you know it; of course I
                                                  have heard frequently from dear, dear
                                                  Charles."</p>
                                                <p>But the guardian met her looks with a keen and
                                                  chilling answer: "Why not! why not! Does he dare
                                                  to write to you, and you to love him? Oh, that I
                                                  had told them both a year ago! But where is he
                                                  now, child? Don't cry, I will not speak so angrily
                                                  again, my Emmy."</p>
                                                <p>"I hardly dare to tell you, dearest sir: you have
                                                  always been as a father to me, and I never knew
                                                  any other; but there are things I cannot explain
                                                  to myself, and I was very wretched; and so, kind
                                                  guardian, Charles—Charles was so good—"</p>
                                                <p>"What has he done?—where has he gone?" hastily
                                                  asked his father.</p>
                                                <p>"Oh, don't, don't be angry with us; in a word, he
                                                  is gone to Madras, to find out Nurse Mackie, and
                                                  to tell me who I am."</p>
                                                <p>The poor old man, who had treasured up so long
                                                  some mystery, probably a very diaphanous one, for
                                                  Emily's own dear sake in the world's esteem, and
                                                  from the long bad habit of reserve, fell back into
                                                  his chair as if he had been shot; but he did not
                                                  faint, nor gasp, nor utter a sound; he only looked
                                                  at her so long and sorrowfully, that she ran to
                                                  him, and covered his pale face with her own brown
                                                  curls, kissing him, and wiping from his cheek her
                                                  starting tears.</p>

                                                  something terrible about me—I don't know what—but

                                                <p>And flying up to her room, she returned with as
                                                  much closely-written manuscript as would have

                                                  epistles to mamma)—in fact, dear, we cast anchor
                                                  just outside a furious wall of surf, which makes

                                                  every one who dares to do so certain of a
                                                  watering. There lay the city, most invitingly to

                                                  mince-meat of the Spanish Armada, and have smashed
                                                  Sir William Elphinston to pieces. How, then, did

                                                  some huge flat-bottomed boats, like coal-barges,
                                                  and even so, were grated and ground several times
                                                  by the churning waves on the ragged reefs beneath
                                                  us: and, just as I was enjoying the see-saw, and
                                                  trying to comfort two poor drenched women-kind who
                                                  were terribly afraid of sharks, a huge,
                                                  cream-coloured breaker came bustling alongside of
                                                  us, and roaring out 'Charles Tracy,' gobbled me up
                                                  bodily. Well, dearest, it wasn't the first time I
                                                  had floundered in the waters [noble Charles! noble
                                                  Charles! he had long forgiven Julian]; so I was
                                                  battling on as well as I could, with a stout heart
                                                  and a steady arm, when—don't be afraid—a
                                                  <hi>Catamaran</hi> caught me! If you haven't

                                                  Emmy!) read on; and you will find that this
                                                  alarming sort of animal is neither an albatross
                                                  nor an alligator, but simply—a life-boat with a<pb n="75"/> Triton in the stern. Yes, God's messenger
                                                  of life to me and happiness to you, my girl, came
                                                  in the shape of a kindly, chattering,
                                                  blue-skinned, human creature, who dragged me out
                                                  of the surf, landed me safely, and, I need not
                                                  say, got paid with more than hearty thanks. So, I
                                                  scuffled to the custom-house to look after my

                                                  the dreadful secret from them. The adultery,
                                                  indeed, was sin; but years of ill-concealings have

                                                <p>Emily was taken very ill, and had a long fit of
                                                  sickness. Day and night—night and day, did her

                                                  gentle as the gentlest nurse—tender as the
                                                  tenderest of mothers. And, indeed, the Lord of

                                                  man; and his eyes caught the ray of Heaven's
                                                  mercy, looking up in joy to read forgiveness; and
                                                  his heart was bathed in penitence—the rock flowed
                                                  out amain; and his mind was quickened into
                                                  faith—he lived, he breathed "a new-born babe,"
                                                  that poor and bad old man, given to the prayers of

                                                  would once more begin to droop; so she cried a

                                                  not been for the remembrance of God's love,
                                                  resignation to His will, and trust in the wisdom
                                                  of his Providence. But these specific remedies
                                                  gradually brought her round, while the kind-eyed
                                                  doctors praised their own prescriptions: and after
                                                  many rallyings and relapses, delirious ramblings,
                                                  and intervals of hallowed Christian peace, the eye
                                                  of Love's meek martyr brightened up once more, and
                                                  health flushed again upon her cheek.</p>
                                                <p>She recovered, God be praised! for her death
                                                  would have been poor Charles's too; and the same
                                                  grave that yawned for her and him would have
                                                  closed upon their father also. Even as it was,
                                                  when she arose from off the weary bed of sickness,
                                                  it was to be a nurse herself, and watch beside
                                                  that patient, weak old man. He could not bear her
                                                  out of his sight all the fever through; but
                                                  eagerly would listen to her hymns and prayers,
                                                  joining in them faintly like a dying saint. With
                                                  the saddening secret, which had so long pressed
                                                  upon his mind, he seemed to have thrown off his
                                                  old nature, as a cast skin: and now he was all
                                                  frankness for reserve, all piety for profaneness,
                                                  all peacefulness for blusterings and wrath.</p>
                                                <p>He remembered then poor Julian and his mother:
                                                  taking blame to himself, justly, deeply, for
                                                  neglected duties, chilling lack of sympathy, <pb n="80"/>and that dull domestic sin, that still
                                                  continued evil of unnatural omissions—stern
                                                  reserve. And he would gladly have seen Julian by
                                                  his bedside, to have freely forgiven the lad, and
                                                  welcomed him home again, and begun once more, in
                                                  openness and charity, all things fair and new: but
                                                  Julian was not to be found, though rewards were
                                                  offered, and placards posted up, and emissaries
                                                  from the Detective Police-force sought him far and
                                                  wide. Alas! the bold bad man had heard with scorn
                                                  of his father's penitence, and knew that he would
                                                  gladly have received him;—but what cared he for
                                                  kindnesses or pardons? He only lived to waylay
                                                  Emily.</p>
                                                <p>As for Mrs. Tracy, she was seldom in a state to
                                                  appear; but one day she managed to refrain a
                                                  little, and came to see her husband, almost sober.
                                                  I was, authorially speaking, behind the door, and
                                                  saw and heard as follows:</p>
                                                <p>The old man, worn and emaciate, was weakly
                                                  sitting up in bed, and Emma by his side, with the
                                                  Bible in her lap: she casually shut it as the
                                                  mother entered.</p>
                                                <p>"Well, Miss Warren, there's a time for all
                                                  things; but this is neither morning, noon, nor
                                                  night: nor Sunday either, nor holiday, that I know
                                                  of; it's eleven o'clock on Tuesday, Miss—and I
                                                  think you might as well leave the general at
                                                  peace, without troubling him for ever with your
                                                  prayer-books and your Bibles."</p>
                                                <p>"Jane, my dear, I requested it of Emily; come and
                                                  sit by me, and take my hand, wife."</p>
                                                <p>"Thank you, sir, you are very obliging: not while
                                                  that young woman is in the room.—You ought to be
                                                  ashamed of yourself, General Tracy."</p>
                                                <p>Poor Emmy ran away to weep. It seems that, in her
                                                  delirium, she had spoken many things, and the
                                                  servants blabbed them out to Mrs. Tracy.</p>
                                                <p>"Ah, my poor wife, indeed I am: both ashamed and
                                                  sorry—heartily sorry. But God forgives me, Jenny,
                                                  and I hope that you will too."</p>
                                                <p>"Upon, my word, general, you carry it off with a
                                                  high hand: and, not content, sir, with insulting
                                                  me in my own home by bringing here your other
                                                  women's children, you have expelled poor dear,
                                                  dear Julian."</p>
                                                <p>"Jane, if you will remember, he ran away himself;
                                                  and you know that now I gladly would receive him:
                                                  we are all prodigal sons together, and if God can
                                                  bear with us, Jane, we ought to look kindly on
                                                  each other."</p>
                                                <p>"Ha! that's always the way with old sinners like
                                                  you—canting hypocrites! Be a man, General Tracy,
                                                  if you can, and talk sense. I never <pb n="81"/>did any harm or sin in all my life yet, and
                                                  don't intend to: and my poor boy Julian's well
                                                  enough, if they'd only let him alone; but nobody
                                                  understands his heart but me. Good boy, I'm sure
                                                  there's virtue enough left in him, if he loves his
                                                  mother."—<hi>If</hi> he loves his mother.</p>
                                                <p>"Jane, dear, I sent for you to kiss you; for I
                                                  could not die in peace, nor live in peace
                                                  (whichever God may please), without your pardon,
                                                  Jane, for a thousand unkindnesses—but, especially
                                                  for the sin that gave me Emily. Forgive me this,
                                                  my wife."</p>
                                                <p>"Never, sir!" rejoined that miserable mind; and
                                                  fancied that she was acting virtuously. She thrust
                                                  aside the kindly proffered hand; scowled at him
                                                  with darkened brow; drew up her commanding height;
                                                  and, calling Mrs. Siddons to remembrance, brushed
                                                  away in the indignant attitude of a tragedy
                                                  queen.</p>
                                                <p>Emmy ran again to her father, and the vain bad
                                                  mother to her bottle; we must leave them to their

                                                <p>Few things could well be more unlikely
                                                  than that Emily should hear of Charles again
                                                  before she saw him: for, having left Madras as
                                                  speedily as might be, now that his mission was so
                                                  easily, yet so naturally, accomplished—having
                                                  posted, as we know, his overland letter—and having
                                                  got on board the fast-sailing ship Samarang,
                                                  Captain Trueman, Charles, in the probable course
                                                  of things, if he wrote at all, must have been his
                                                  own postman. But the Fates—(our Christianity can
                                                  afford to wink now and then at Clotho, Lachesis,
                                                  and Atropos; for, at any rate, they are as
                                                  reasonable creatures as Chance, Luck, and
                                                  Accident,)—the Fates willed it otherwise: and,
                                                  accordingly, it is in my power to lay before the
                                                  reader another genuine lucubration of Charles
                                                  Tracy.</p>
                                                <p>A change had come over the spirit of their dream,
                                                  those youthful lovers: and agonizing doubt must
                                                  rack their hearts, threatening to rend them both
                                                  asunder. It is evident to me that Charles's letter
                                                  (which Emily showed to me with a melancholy face)
                                                  was on principle less warm, less dottable with

                                                  intending very gently, very gradually, to wean her
                                                  from him, if he could; for his faith in Jeanie

                                                  before you see me: but I am glad of this
                                                  providential opportunity, as it may serve to
                                                  prepare us both. Naturally enough you will ask,
                                                  why Charles cannot accompany this letter? I will
                                                  tell you, dear, in one word—Mrs. Mackie is now
                                                  lying very ill on shore; and, as far as our poor
                                                  ship is concerned, you shall hear about it all
                                                  anon. Several of the passengers, who were in a
                                                  hurry to get home, have left us, and gone in the
                                                  packet-boat that takes you this letter: gladly, as
                                                  you know, would I have accompanied them, for I
                                                  long to see you, poor dear girl; but it was
                                                  impossible to leave the old woman, upon whom
                                                  alone, under God, our hopes of earthly happiness
                                                  depend: if, alas! we still can dream about such
                                                  hopes.</p>

                                                  as to have left those letters of introduction,
                                                  wherewith you kindly supplied me, in an innocent

                                                  waiting at Madras for the next ship to England;
                                                  and in my folly, forgetful of the single aim with
                                                  which I had come, Jeanie Mackie, to wit, I thought
                                                  I might as well use my present opportunities, and
                                                  see what I could of the place and its

                                                  not there: splendour, prodigality, and red-hot
                                                  rooms, only made endurable by perpetually fanning
                                                  punkahs: pompous counsellors, authorities, and
                                                  other men in office, and a glut of military
                                                  uniforms: vulgar wealth, transparent match-making,
                                                  and predominating dullness: along with some few of

                                                  all, too well, Emily, dear. And I have been
                                                  pestering Nurse Mackie night and day; but the old
                                                  woman is so afraid of being left behind any where,
                                                  or thrown overboard, or dropped, upon some desert
                                                  rock, that she is quite cross, and won't say a
                                                  single word in answer, even when I tell her all
                                                  these terrible tales. Her resolution is, not to
                                                  reveal one syllable more, until she sets foot on
                                                  England; and several people at Madras annoyed me
                                                  exceedingly by saying, that this kind of thing is
                                                  an old trick with people who wish to be sent home
                                                  again. She has hidden away her papers somewhere;
                                                  not that I was going to steal them: but it shows
                                                  how little trust she puts in any thing, or any
                                                  one, except the keeping of her own secret.
                                                  However, she does adhere obstinately, and
                                                  hopefully for us, to her original hint, 'you are
                                                  not what he thinks you;' although she will not
                                                  condescend to any single proof, or explanation,
                                                  against the mighty mass of evidence, which
                                                  probabilities, and common rumour, and the
                                                  general's own belief, have heaped together. When I
                                                  call you Emmy, too—the old soul, in her broad
                                                  Scotch way, always corrects me, and invokes a
                                                  blessing upon 'A-amy:' so there is a mystery
                                                  somewhere: at least, I fervently hope there is:
                                                  and, if the old woman has been playing us false,
                                                  let us resign ourselves to God, my girl; for our
                                                  fate will be that matters are as people say they
                                                  are—and then my old black postscript ends too

                                                  was soon made known, and among the first to our

                                                  barometer, he viewed the little cloud in evident
                                                  anxiety, and shook his head with a solemn air:
                                                  more than one light-hearted woman thinking he was

                                                  others gathered round it, all dancing about on the
                                                  horizon, as if sheaves of mischief tossed about by
                                                  devils: I don't wish to be poetical, Emmy, for my
                                                  heart is very, very sad; but if ever the powers of
                                                  the air sow the wind and reap the whirlwind, they
                                                  were gathering in their harvest at that door.
                                                  Underneath the skipping clouds, which came on
                                                  quickly, leaping over each other, as when the wain
                                                  is loaded by a score of hands, I noticed a sea
                                                  approaching, such as Pharaoh must have seen, when
                                                  the wall of waters fell upon him; and premonitory
                                                  winds came whistling by, and two or three sails
                                                  were flapping in them still, and I was hurried
                                                  down stairs after all the rest of us.</p>

                                                <p>"Then, on a sudden, it appeared not winds, nor
                                                  waves, nor thunder, but as if the squadroned
                                                  cavalry of heaven had charged across the seas, and
                                                  crushed our battered ship beneath their
                                                  horse-hoofs! We were flung down flat on our beam
                                                  ends; and the two or three unfurled sails,
                                                  bursting with the noise of a cannon, were
                                                  scattered miles away to lee-ward as if they had
                                                  been paper. As for the poor fellows in the
                                                  rigging, the spirit of the storm had already made
                                                  them his: twenty of our men were swept away by
                                                  that tornado.</p>
                                                <p>"Then there was hewing and cleaving on deck, the
                                                  clatter of many axes and hatchets: for we were in
                                                  imminent danger of being capsized, keel uppermost,
                                                  and our only chance was to cut away the masts.</p>
                                                <p>"The muscles of courage were tried then, my Emmy,
                                                  and the strength which religion gives a man. I
                                                  felt sensibly held up by the Everlasting Arms: I
                                                  could listen to the still small Voice in the midst
                                                  of a crash which might have been the end of all
                                                  things: though in darkness, God had given me
                                                  light; though in uttermost peril, my peace was
                                                  never calmer in our little village school.</p>
                                                <p>"And the billows were knocking at the poor ship's
                                                  side like sledge hammers; and the lightnings fell
                                                  around us scorchingly, with forked bolts, as
                                                  arrows from the hand of a giant; the thunders
                                                  overhead, close overhead, crashing from a concave
                                                  cloud that hung about us heavily—a dense, black,
                                                  suffocating curtain—roared and raved as nothing
                                                  earthly can, but thunder in the tropics; the rain
                                                  was as a cataract, literally rushing in a mass:
                                                  the winds appeared not winds, nor whirlwinds, but
                                                  legions of emancipated demons shrieking horribly,
                                                  and flapping their wide wings; a flock of
                                                  night-birds flying from the dawn; and all else was
                                                  darkness, confusion, rolling and rocking about,
                                                  the screams of women, the shouts of men, curses
                                                  and prayers, agony, despair, and—peace, deep
                                                  peace.</p>
                                                <p>"On a sudden, to our great astonishment, all was
                                                  silent again, oppressively silent; and, but for
                                                  the swell upon the seas, all still. The tornado
                                                  had rushed by: that troop of Tartar horse, having
                                                  sacked the village, are departed, now in full
                                                  retreat: the blackness and the fury are beheld on
                                                  our lee, hastening across the broad Atlantic to
                                                  Cuba or Jamaica: and behold, a tranquil temperate
                                                  sky, a kindly rolling sea, a favouring breeze,
                                                  and—not a sail, but some slight jury-rig, to catch
                                                  it.</p>
                                                <p>"Many days we drifted like a log upon the wave;
                                                  provisions running short, and water—water under
                                                  tropical suns—scantily dealt out in tea-cups.
                                                  Then, poor old Mackie's health gave way; and I
                                                  dreaded for her <pb n="86"/>death: one living
                                                  witness is worth a cart-load of cold documents. So
                                                  I nursed and watched her constantly: till the
                                                  foolish folks on board began to say I was her son:
                                                  ah! me, for your sake I wish it had been so.</p>
                                                <p>"And at length, just as some among the sailors
                                                  were hinting at a mutiny for spirits, and our last
                                                  case of Gamble's meat was opened for the sick, our
                                                  look-out on the jury-mast gave the welcome note of
                                                  'Land!' and soon, to us on deck, the heights of
                                                  St. Helena rose above the sea. Towed in by
                                                  friendly aid, here we are, then, precious Emily,
                                                  refitting: and, as it must be a week yet before we
                                                  can be ready, I have taken my old woman to a
                                                  lodging upon land, and rejoice (what have I to do
                                                  with joy?) to see her speedily recovering."</p>

                                                  between them, no reservings, and heart-stricken
                                                  Emily heard from her repentant father's lips the
                                                  story of her birth: she was, he said, his own
                                                  daughter by a native princess, the Begum Dowlia
                                                  Burruckjutli.</p>
                                                <p>A bitter—bitter truth was that: the destruction
                                                  of all her hopes, pleasures, and affections. It
                                                  had now become to her a sin to love that dearest
                                                  one of all things lovely on this earth: duty,
                                                  paramount and stern, commanded her, without a
                                                  shadow of reprieve, to execute on herself
                                                  immediately the terrible sentence of banishing her
                                                  own betrothed: nay, more, she must forget him,
                                                  erase his precious image from her heart, and
                                                  never, never see that brother more. And Charles
                                                  must feel the same, and do <pb n="87"/>the like;
                                                  oh! sorrow, passing words! and their two
                                                  commingled souls must be violently wrenched apart;
                                                  for such love in them were crime.</p>
                                                <p>Dear children of affection—it is a dreadful
                                                  lesson this for both of you; but most wise, most
                                                  needful—or the hand that guideth all things, never
                                                  would have sent it. Know ye not for comfort, that
                                                  ye are of those to whom all things work together
                                                  for good? Know ye not for counsel, that the excess
                                                  of love is an idolatry that must be blighted? It
                                                  is well, children, it is well, that ye should thus
                                                  carry your wounded hearts for balm to the altar of
                                                  God; it is well that ye should bow in meekness to
                                                  His will, in readiness to His wisdom. Ye are
                                                  learning the lesson speedily, as docile children
                                                  should; and be assured of high reward from the
                                                  Teacher who hath set it you. Poor Charles! white
                                                  and wan, thy cheek is grown transparent with
                                                  anxiety, and thy blue eye dim with hope deferred:
                                                  poor Emmy, sick and weak, thou weariest Heaven
                                                  with thy prayers, and waterest thy couch with thy
                                                  tears. Yet, a little while; this discipline is
                                                  good: storm and wind, frost and rushing rains, are
                                                  as needful to the forest-tree as sun and gentle
                                                  shower; the root is strengthening, and its fibres
                                                  spreading out: and loving still each other with
                                                  the best of human love, ye justly now have found
                                                  out how to anchor all your strongest hopes, and
                                                  deepest thoughts, on Him who made you for himself.
                                                  Who knoweth? wisely acquiescing in His will,
                                                  humbly trusting to His mercy, and bringing the
                                                  holocaust of your inflamed affections as an
                                                  offering of duty to your God—who knoweth? Cannot
                                                  He interpose? will He not befriend you? For His
                                                  arm is power, and His heart is love.</p>
                                                <p>Days rolled on in dull monotony, and grew to
                                                  weeks more slowly than before; earthly hopes had
                                                  been levelled with the dust; life had forgotten to
                                                  be joyous: there was, indeed, the calm, the peace,
                                                  the resignation, the heavenly ante-past, and the
                                                  soul-entrancing prayer; but human life to Emily
                                                  was flat, wearisome, and void; she felt like a
                                                  nun, immolated as to this world: even as Charles,
                                                  too, had resolved to be an anchorite, a stern,
                                                  hard, mortified man, who once had feelings and
                                                  affections. The rëaction in both those fond young
                                                  hearts had even overstept the golden mean: and
                                                  Mercy interposed to make all right, and to bless
                                                  them in each other once again.</p>

                                                  Jeanie Mackie has given me proofs posi<pb n="88"/>tive: all I have to wish is that she could move:
                                                  but she is very ill; so, as we touched here on the
                                                  voyage up channel, I landed her and myself,
                                                  thinking to kiss, within a day, my darling Emmy.
                                                  But I cannot get her out of bed this morning, and
                                                  dare not leave her: though an hour's delay seems
                                                  almost insupportable. If I possibly can manage it,
                                                  I will bring the dear old faithful creature,
                                                  wrapped in blankets, by chaise to-morrow. Tell my

                                                <p>Dearest Emily had taken up the note with fears
                                                  and trembling: she laid it down, as they that reap

                                                <p>Next day, a fine summer afternoon, when
                                                  our feeble convalescents had gone out together,
                                                  they found the fresh air so invigorating, and
                                                  themselves so much stronger, that they prolonged
                                                  their walk half-way to Oxton. The pasture-meadows,
                                                  rich and rank, were alive with flocks and herds;
                                                  the blue sea lazily beat time, as, ticking out the
                                                  seconds, it melodiously broke upon the sleeping
                                                  shore; the darkly-flowing Mullet swept sounding to
                                                  the sea between its tortuous banks; and upon that

                                                  with meadow-sweet, crept our chastened pair.</p>
                                                <p>Just as they were nearing a short angle in the

                                                  they noticed for the first time a rough-looking
                                                  fisherman, who, unseen, had tracked their steps
                                                  some hundred yards; he had a tarpaulin over his
                                                  shoulder, very unnecessarily, as it would seem, on
                                                  so fine and warm a day; and a slouching
                                                  sou'-wester, worn askew, flapped across the

                                                <p>He came on quickly, though cautiously, looking
                                                  right and left; and Emily trembled on her
                                                  guardian's feeble arm. Yes—she is right; the
                                                  fisherman approaches—she detects him through it
                                                  all: and now he scorns disguise; flinging off his
                                                  cap and the tarpaulin, stands before
                                                  them—Julian!</p>
                                                <p>"So, sir—you tremble now, do you, gallant
                                                  general: give me the girl." And he levelled at his
                                                  father one of those double-barrelled pistols,
                                                  full-cock.</p>
                                                <p>"Julian, my son, I forgive you, Julian; take my
                                                  hand, boy."</p>
                                                <p>"What—coward? now you can cringe, and fawn, eh?
                                                  back with you!—the girl, I say." For poor Emily,
                                                  wild with fear, was clinging to that weak old
                                                  man.</p>
                                                <p>Julian levelled again; indeed, indeed it was only
                                                  as a threat; but his hand shook with passion—the
                                                  weapon was full-cock, hair-triggered—shotted
                                                  heavily as always—hark, hark!—And his father fell
                                                  upon the turf, covered with blood!</p>
                                                <p>When a wicked man tampers with unintended crime,
                                                  even accident falls out against him. Many a one
                                                  has richly merited death for many other sins, than
                                                  that isolated, haply accidental one which he has
                                                  hanged for.</p>
                                                <p>Julian, horror-stricken, pale and trembling, flew
                                                  instinctively to help his father: but Emily has
                                                  circled him already with her arms; and listen,
                                                  Julian—your dying father speaks to you.</p>
                                                <p>"Boy, I forgive—I forgive: but—Emily, no, no,
                                                  cannot, cannot be—Julian—she—she is your
                                                  <hi>sister</hi>!" and the old man swooned away,
                                                  from loss of blood and the excitement of that
                                                  awful scene.</p>
                                                <p>Not a word in reply said that poor sinner,
                                                  maddened with his life-long crimes, the fratricide
                                                  in will, the parricide in deed, and all for—a
                                                  sister. But growing whiter as he stood, a marble
                                                  man with bristling hair, he slowly drew the other
                                                  pistol from his pocket, put the muzzle to his
                                                  mouth, and, firing as he fell, leapt into the
                                                  darkly-flowing Mullet!</p>
                                                <p><pb n="90"/>The current, all too violent to sink
                                                  in, and uncommissioned now to save, hurried its
                                                  black burden to the sea; and a crimson streak of
                                                  gore marked the track of the suicide.</p>
                                                <p>The old man was not dead; but a brace of bullets
                                                  taking effect upon his feeble frame—one through
                                                  the shoulder, and another which had grazed his
                                                  head—had been quite enough to make him seem so.
                                                  Forgetful of all but that dear sufferer, and
                                                  totally ignorant of Julian's fate—for she neither
                                                  saw nor heard any thing, nor feared even for her
                                                  own imminent peril, while her father lay dying on
                                                  the grass—Emily had torn off her scarf, and bound
                                                  up, as well as she could, the ghastly scored head
                                                  and broken shoulder. She succeeded in staunching
                                                  the blood—for no great vessel had been severed—and
                                                  so simple an application as grass dipped in water,
                                                  proved to be a good specific. Then, to her
                                                  exceeding joy, those eyes opened again, and that
                                                  dear tongue faintly whispered—"Bless you."</p>
                                                <p>Oh, that blessing! for it fell upon her heart:
                                                  and fervently she knelt down there, and thanked
                                                  the Great Preserver.</p>
                                                <p>And now, for friendly help; there is no one near:
                                                  and it is growing dusk; and she dared not leave
                                                  him there alone one minute—for Julian—dreaded
                                                  Julian, may return, and kill him. What shall she
                                                  do? How to get him home? Alas, alas! he may die
                                                  where he is lying.</p>
                                                <p>Hark, Emmy, hark! The shouts of happy children
                                                  bursting out of school! See, dearest—see: here
                                                  they come homewards merrily from Oxton.</p>
                                                <p>Thus, rewarded through the instrumentality of her

                                                  Mrs. Sainsbury's invalid-chair, hurried to the
                                                  spot by an escort of indignant rustics, soon
                                                  conveyed the recovering patient to the comforts of
                                                  his own home, and the appliances of medical

                                                  length; that day formerly so hoped-for, latterly
                                                  so feared, but last of all, hailed with the joy
                                                  that trembles at its own intensity. The very

                                                  general was having his wounds dressed, slight
                                                  ones, happily, but still he was not safe, as
                                                  inflammation might ensue—while Mrs. Tracy was
                                                  indulging in her third tumbler, mixed to whet her
                                                  appetite for shrimps—and while Emily was
                                                  deciphering, for the forty thousandth time,
                                                  Charles's sanguine <hi>billet-doux</hi>—lo! a
                                                  dusty chaise and smoking posters, and a sun-burnt
                                                  young fellow springing out, and just upon the
                                                  stairs—they were locked in each other's arms!</p>
                                                <p>Oh, the rapture of that instant! it can but
                                                  happen once within a life. Ye that have loved,
                                                  remember such a meeting; and ye that never loved,
                                                  conceive it if you can; for my pen hath little

                                                  deposited safely on a sofa, no poet is alive to
                                                  sing: to those who would record the payment of
                                                  postillions, let me leave so sweet a theme.</p>
                                                <p>The first fond greeting over, and those tumults
                                                  of affection sobered down, Charles rejoiced to
                                                  find how lovingly the general met him; the kind
                                                  and good old man fell upon his neck, as the father
                                                  in the parable. Many things were then to be made
                                                  known: and many questions answered, as best might
                                                  be, about a mother and a brother; but well aware
                                                  of all things ourselves, let us be satisfied that
                                                  Charles heard in due time all they had to tell
                                                  him; though neither Emily nor the general could
                                                  explain what had become of Julian after that
                                                  terrible encounter. In their belief, he had fled
                                                  for very life, thinking he had killed his father.
                                                  Poor wretched man, thought Charles—on that same
                                                  spot, too, where he would have murdered me! And
                                                  for his mother—why came she not down eagerly and
                                                  happily, as mothers ever do, to greet her
                                                  long-lost son? Do not ask, Charles; do not press
                                                  the question. Think her ill, dying, dead—any thing
                                                  but—drunken. He ran to her room-door; but it was
                                                  locked—luckily.</p>
                                                <p>Now, Charles—now speedily to business; happy
                                                  business that, if I may trust the lover's flushing
                                                  cheek, and Emily's radiant eyes; but a mournful
                                                  one too, and a fearful, if I turn my glance to
                                                  that poor old man, wounded in body and stricken in
                                                  mind—who waits to hear, in more despondency than
                                                  hope, what he knows to be the bitter truth—the
                                                  truth that must be told, to the misery of those
                                                  dear children.</p>
                                                <p>Faint and weak though she appeared, Jeanie
                                                  Mackie's waning life <pb n="92"/>spirited up for
                                                  the occasion; her dim eye kindled; her feeble
                                                  frame was straight and strong; energy nerved her
                                                  as she spoke; this hour is the errand of her
                                                  being.</p>
                                                <p>Long she spoke, and loudly, in her broad Scotch
                                                  way; and the general objected many things, but was
                                                  answered to them all; and there was close
                                                  cross-questioning, slow-caution, keen examination
                                                  of documents and letters: catechisms, solecisms,
                                                  Scottisms; reminiscences rubbed up, mistakes
                                                  corrected; and the grand result of all, Emily a
                                                  Stuart, and the general not her father! I am only
                                                  enabled to give a brief account of that important
                                                  colloquy.</p>
                                                <p>It appears, that when Captain Tracy's company was
                                                  quartered to the west of the Gwalior, sent thither
                                                  to guard the Begum Dowlia against sundry of her
                                                  disaffected subjects, a certain Lieutenant James
                                                  Stuart was one among those welcome brave allies.
                                                  That our gallant Tracy was the beautiful Begum's
                                                  favourite soon became notorious to all; and not
                                                  less so, that the Begum herself was precisely in
                                                  the same interesting situation as Mrs. James
                                                  Stuart. The two ladies, Pagan and Christian, were,
                                                  technically speaking, running a race together.
                                                  Well, just as times drew nigh, poor Lieutenant
                                                  Stuart was unfortunately killed in an insurrection
                                                  headed by some fanatics, who disapproved of
                                                  foreign friends, and perhaps of their princess's
                                                  situation. His death proved fatal also to that
                                                  kind and faithful wife of his—a dark Italian lady
                                                  of high family, whose love for James had led her
                                                  to follow him even into Central Hindoostan: she
                                                  died in giving birth to a babe; and Jeanie Mackie,
                                                  the lieutenant's own foster-mother, who waited on
                                                  his wife through all their travels, assisted the
                                                  poor orphan into this bleak world, and loved it as
                                                  her own.</p>
                                                <p>Two days after all this, the Begum herself had
                                                  need of Mrs. Mackie: for it was prudent to conceal
                                                  some things, if she could, from certain Brahmins,
                                                  who were to her what John Knox had erstwhile been
                                                  to Mary: and Jeanie Mackie, burdened with her
                                                  little Amy Stuart, aided in the birth of a female
                                                  Tracy-Begum. So, the nurse tended both babes; and
                                                  more than once had marvelled at their general
                                                  resemblance; Amy's mother looked out again from
                                                  those dark eyes; there was not a shade between the
                                                  children.</p>
                                                <p>Now, Mrs. Mackie perceived, in a very little
                                                  while, how fond both Christian and Pagan appeared
                                                  of their own child; and how little notice was
                                                  taken by any body of the poor Scotch gentleman's
                                                  orphan. Accordingly, with a view to give her
                                                  favourite all worldly advantages, she adroitly <pb n="93"/>changed the children; and, while she was
                                                  still kind and motherly to the little Tracy-Begum,
                                                  she had the satisfaction to see her pet
                                                  supposititiously brought up in all the splendours
                                                  of an Eastern court.</p>
                                                <p>Years wore away, for Captain Tracy was quite
                                                  happy, the Begum being a fine showy woman, and the
                                                  pretty child his playmate and pastime: so he never
                                                  cared to stir from his rich quarters, till the
                                                  company's orders forced him: and then
                                                  Puttymuddyfudgepoor hailed him accumulatively both
                                                  major and colonel.</p>
                                                <p>When he found that he must go, he insisted on
                                                  carrying off the child; and the Begum was as
                                                  resolute against it. Then Mrs. Mackie, eager to
                                                  expedite little Stuart in her escape, went to the
                                                  princess, told her how that, in anticipation of
                                                  this day, she had changed the children, and got
                                                  great rewards for thus restoring to the mother her
                                                  own offspring.</p>
                                                <p>The remainder of that old Scotch nurse's very
                                                  prosy tale may be left to be imagined: for all
                                                  that was essential has been stated: and the
                                                  documents in proof of all were these—</p>
                                                <p>First: The marriage certificates of James Stuart
                                                  and Ami di Romagna, duly attested, both in the
                                                  Protestant and Romanist forms.</p>
                                                <p>Secondly: Divers letters to Lieutenant Stewart
                                                  from his friends at Glenmuir; others to Mrs.
                                                  Stuart, from her father, the old Marquis di
                                                  Romagna, at Naples: several trinkets, locks of
                                                  hair, the wedding-ring, etc.</p>
                                                <p>Thirdly: A grant written in the Hindoostanee
                                                  character, from the Begum Dowlia, promising the
                                                  pension of thirty rupees a month to Jeanie Mackie,
                                                  for having so cleverly preserved to her the child:
                                                  together with a regular judicial acknowledgement,
                                                  both from several of Tracy's own sepoys, and from
                                                  the Begum herself, that the girl, whom Captain
                                                  Tracy was so fond of, was, to the best of their
                                                  belief, Amy Stuart.</p>
                                                <p>Fourthly: A miniature of Mrs. James Stuart,
                                                  exactly portraying the features of her
                                                  daughter—this bright, beautiful, dark-eyed
                                                  face—our own beloved Emily Warren.</p>
                                                <p>And to all that accumulated evidence, Jeanie
                                                  Mackie bore her living testimony; clearly,
                                                  unhesitatingly, and well assured, in the face of
                                                  God and man.</p>
                                                <p>Doubt was at an end; fear was at an end; hope was
                                                  come, and joy. Happy were the lovers, happy Jeanie
                                                  Mackie, but happiest of all appeared the general
                                                  himself. For now she might be his daughter indeed,
                                                  sweet Emmy Tracy still, dear Charles's loving
                                                  wife. And he blessed them as they knelt, and gave
                                                  them to each other; well-rewarded children of
                                                  affection, who had prayed in their distress!</p>

                                                <p>There is a muddy sort of sand-bank,
                                                  acting as a delta to the Mullet, just where it
                                                  spreads from deep to shallow, and falls into the
                                                  sea. Strange wild fowl abound there, coming from
                                                  the upper clouds in flocks; and at high water,
                                                  very little else but rushes can be seen, to
                                                  testify its sub-marine existence.</p>
                                                <p>A knot of fishermen, idling on the beach, have
                                                  noticed an uncommon flight of Royston crows
                                                  gathered at the island, with the object, as it
                                                  would appear, of battening on a dead porpoise, or
                                                  some such body, just discernible among the rushes.
                                                  Stop—that black heap may be kegs of
                                                  whiskey;—where's the glass?</p>
                                                <p>Every one looked: it warn't barrels—and it warn't
                                                  a porpoise: what was it, then? they had
                                                  universally nothing on earth to do, so they pushed
                                                  off in company to see.</p>
                                                <p>I watched the party off, and they poked among the
                                                  rushes, and heaved out what seemed to me a seal:
                                                  so I ran down to the beach to look at the strange
                                                  creature they had captured. Something wrapped in a
                                                  sail; no doubt for exhibition at per head.</p>
                                                <p>But they brought out that black burden solemnly,
                                                  laying it on the beach at Burleigh: a crowd
                                                  quickly collected round them, that I could not see
                                                  the creature: and some ran for a magistrate, and
                                                  some for a parson. Then men in office came—made a
                                                  way through the crowd, and I got near: so near,
                                                  that my foolish curiosity lifted up the sail, and
                                                  I beheld—what had been Julian.</p>
                                                <p>O, sickening sight: for all which the pistol had
                                                  spared of that swart and hairy face, had been
                                                  preyed upon by birds and fishes!</p>
                                                <p>There was a hurried inquest: the poor general and
                                                  Emily deposed to what they knew, and the rustics,
                                                  who escorted him from Oxton. The verdict could be
                                                  only one—self-murder.</p>
                                                <p>So, by night, on that same swampy island, when
                                                  the tide was low, they buried him, deeply staked
                                                  into the soil, lest the waves should disinter him,
                                                  without a parting prayer. Such is the end of the
                                                  wicked.</p>
                                                <p>In a day or two, I noticed that a rude wooden
                                                  cross had been set over the spot: and it gratified
                                                  me much to hear that a rough-looking crew of
                                                  smugglers had boldly come and fixed it there, to
                                                  hallow, if they could, a comrade's grave.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="95"/>However, these poor fellows had been
                                                  cheated hours before: Charles's brotherly care had
                                                  secured the poor remains, and the vicar winked a
                                                  blind permission: so Charles buried them by night
                                                  in the church-yard corner, under the yew, reading
                                                  many prayers above them.</p>
                                                <p>Two fierce-looking strange men went to that
                                                  burial with reverent looks, as it were chief
                                                  mourners; and when all the rites were done, I
                                                  heard them gruffly say to Charles, "God bless you,
                                                  sir, for this!"</p>
                                                <p>When the mother heard those tidings of her son,
                                                  she was sobered on the instant, and ran about the
                                                  house with all a mother's grief, shrieking like a
                                                  mad woman. But all her shrieks and tears could not
                                                  bring back poor Julian; deep, deep in the silent
                                                  grave, she cannot wake him—cannot kiss him now. Ah
                                                  well! ah well!</p>
                                                <p>Then did she return to his dear room, desperate
                                                  for him—and Hollands once, twice, thrice, she
                                                  poured out a full tumbler of the burning fluid,
                                                  and drank it off like water; and it maddened her
                                                  brain: her mind was in a phrensy of delirium,
                                                  while her body shook as with a palsy.</p>
                                                <p>Let us draw the curtain; for she died that
                                                  night.</p>
                                                <p>They buried her in Aunt Green's grave: what a
                                                  meeting theirs will be at the day of
                                                  resurrection!</p>

                                                <p>Six months at least—this is clearly not
                                                  a story of the unities—six months' interval must
                                                  now elapse before the wedding-day. Charles and
                                                  Emmy—for he called her Emmy still, though Jeanie
                                                  Mackie would persist in mouthing it to
                                                  "Aamy,"—wished to have it delayed a year, in
                                                  respect for the memory of those who, with all
                                                  their crime and folly, were not the less a mother
                                                  and a brother: but the general would not hear of
                                                  such a thing; he was growing very old, he said;
                                                  although actually he seemed to have taken out a
                                                  new lease of life, so young again and buoyant was
                                                  the new-found heart within him; and thus growing
                                                  old, he was full of fatherly fear that he should
                                                  not live to see his children's happiness. It was
                                                  only reasonable and proper that our pair of cooing
                                                  doves should acquiesce in his desire.</p>
                                                <p><pb n="96"/>Meanwhile, I am truly sorry to say
                                                  it, Jeanie Mackie died; for it would have been a
                                                  good novel-like incident to have suffered the
                                                  faithful old creature to have witnessed her
                                                  favourite's wedding, and then to have been
                                                  forthwith killed out of the way, by—perishing in
                                                  the vestry. However, things were ordered
                                                  otherwise, and Jeanie Mackie did not live to see
                                                  the wedding: if you wish to know how and where she
                                                  died, let me tell you at once.</p>
                                                <p>Scotland—Argyleshire—Glenmuir; this was the focus
                                                  of her hopes and thoughts—that poor old Indian
                                                  exile! She had left it, as a buxom bright-haired
                                                  lassie: but oaks had now grown old that she had
                                                  planted acorns; and grandmothers had died palsied,
                                                  whom she remembered born; still, around the
                                                  mountains and the lakes, those changeless features
                                                  of her girlhood's rugged home, the old woman's
                                                  memory wandered; they were pictured in her mind's
                                                  eye hard, and clear, and definite as if she looked
                                                  upon them now. And her soul's deep hope was to see
                                                  them once again.</p>
                                                <p>There was yet another object which made her yearn
                                                  for Scotland. Lieutenant Stuart had been the
                                                  younger of two brothers, the eldest born of whom
                                                  became, upon his father's, the old laird's, death,
                                                  Glenmuir and Glenmurdock. Now, though twice
                                                  married, this elder brother, the new laird, never
                                                  had a child; and the clear consequence was, that
                                                  Amy Stuart was likely to become sole heiress of
                                                  her ancestor's possessions. The lieutenant's
                                                  marriage with an Italian and a Romanist had been,
                                                  doubtless, any thing but pleasant to his friends;
                                                  the strict old Presbyterians, and the proud
                                                  unsullied family of Stuart, could not palate it at
                                                  all. Nevertheless, he did marry the girl,
                                                  according to the rites of both churches, and there
                                                  was an end of it; so, innumerable proverbs coming
                                                  to their aid about "curing and enduring" and "must
                                                  be's," and the place where "marriages are made,"
                                                  etc., the several aunts and cousins were
                                                  persuaded at length to wink at the iniquity, and
                                                  to correspond both with Mrs. James and her
                                                  backsliding lieutenant. Of the offspring of that
                                                  marriage, and her orphaned state, and of Mrs.
                                                  Mackie's care, and the indefinite detention in
                                                  central Hindostan, they had heard often-times;
                                                  for, as there is no corner of the world where a
                                                  Scot may not be met with, so, with laudable
                                                  nationality, they all hang together; and Glenmuir
                                                  was written to frequently, all about the child,
                                                  through Jeanie Mackie, "her mark," and a scholarly

                                                  Charles did—were now, therefore, the next object
                                                  of Mrs. Mackie's zeal; and all parties <pb n="97"/>interested willingly listened to the plan of
                                                  spending one or two of those weary weeks in
                                                  rubbing up relationships in Scotland; the general
                                                  also was not a little anxious about heritage and
                                                  acres. Accordingly, off they set in the new

                                                  heartily welcomed, to Dunstowr Castle, the fine
                                                  old feudal stronghold of Robert Stuart, Laird of

                                                <p>The journey, the arrival, and the hearty
                                                  hospitality; and how the gray old chieftain kissed
                                                  his pretty niece; and how welcome her betrothed
                                                  Charles and her kind life-long guardian, and her
                                                  faithful nurse were made; and how the beacons
                                                  blazed upon the hill-tops, and the mustering clan
                                                  gathered round about old Dunstowr; and how the
                                                  laird presented to them all their beautiful future
                                                  mistress, and how Jeanie Mackie and her documents
                                                  travelled up to Edinburgh, where writers to the
                                                  signet pestered her heart-sick with over-caution;
                                                  and how the case was all cleared up, and the
                                                  distant disappointed cousin, who had irrationally
                                                  hoped to be the heir, was gladdened, if not
                                                  satisfied, with a pension and a cantle of
                                                  Glenmuir; and how all was joyfulness and feasting,
                                                  when Amy Stuart was acknowledged in her rights—the
                                                  bagpipes and the wassail, salmon, and deer, and
                                                  black-cock, with a river of mountain dew: let
                                                  others tell who know Dunstowr; for as I never was
                                                  there, of course I cannot faithfully describe it.
                                                  Should such an historian as I condescend to sheer
                                                  inventions?</p>
                                                <p>With respect to Jeanie Mackie, I could learn no
                                                  more than this: she was sprightly and lively, and
                                                  strong as ever, though in her ninetieth year, till
                                                  her foster-child was righted, and the lawyers had
                                                  allowed her her claim. But then there seemed
                                                  nothing else to live for; so her life gradually
                                                  faded from her eye, as an expiring candle; and she
                                                  would doze by the hour, sitting on a settle in the
                                                  sun, basking her old heart in the smile of those
                                                  old mountains. None knew when she died, to a
                                                  minute; for she died sitting in the sun, in the
                                                  smile of those old mountains.</p>
                                                <p>They buried her, with much of rustic pomp, in the
                                                  hill-church of Glenmuir, where all her fathers
                                                  slept around her; and Emily and Charles,
                                                  hand-in-hand, walked behind her coffin
                                                  mournfully.</p>

                                                <p>Gladly would the laird have had marriage
                                                  at Dunstower, and have given away the beauteous
                                                  bride himself: but there must still be two months
                                                  more of decent mourning, and the general had long
                                                  learned to sigh for the maligned delights of
                                                  Burleigh Singleton. So, Glenmuir could only get a
                                                  promise of reappearance some fine summer or other:
                                                  and, after another day's deer-stalking, which made

                                                <p>And now, in due time, were the Tamworths full of
                                                  joy—congratulating, sympathizing, merrymaking; and
                                                  the three young ladies behaved admirably in the
                                                  capacity of pink and silver bridesmaids; while
                                                  George proved equally kind in attending (as he
                                                  called it) Charles's "execution," wherein he was

                                                  rich brown hair; let him speak lengthily, whose
                                                  province it may be to spin three volumes out of
                                                  one: for me, I always wish to recollect that

                                                  imagination as writers. And why should you not
                                                  exercise it now? Is not Emmy in her bridal-dress a

                                                <p>For a similar reason, I must clearly disappoint
                                                  feminine expectation, by forbearing to descant
                                                  upon Charles's slight but manly form, and his

                                                  kisses Emily Warren, and marries Amy Stuart." The
                                                  captain, happier than before, called complacently
                                                  for Cayenne pepper, and relished his mock-turtle
                                                  with a higher gusto.</p>
                                                <p>It is worth recording, that the same change of
                                                  name mystified slanderous friends in the
                                                  Presidency of Madras.</p>
                                                <p>And now, kind-eyed reader, this story of '<hi>The
                                                  Twins</hi>' must leave off abruptly at the
                                                  wedding. As in its companion-tale, '<hi>The Crock
                                                  of Gold</hi>,' one grand thesis for our thoughts
                                                  was that holy wise command, "Thou shall not
                                                  covet," and as its other comrade '<hi>Heart</hi>'
                                                  is founded on "Thou shalt not bear false witness,"
                                                  so in this, the seed-corn of the crop, were five
                                                  pure words, "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
                                                  Other morals doubtless grew up round us, for all
                                                  virtue hangs together in a bunch: the harms of
                                                  secresy, false witness, inordinate affections, and
                                                  red murder: but in chief, as we have said.</p>
                                                <p>Moreover, I wish distinctly to make known, for
                                                  dear "domestic" sake, that so far from our lovers'
                                                  happiness having been consummated (that is,
                                                  finished) in the honey-moon—it was only then
                                                  begun. How long they are to live thus happily
                                                  together, Heaven, who wills all things good, alone
                                                  can tell; I wish them three score years. Little
                                                  ones, I hear, arrive annually—to the unqualified
                                                  joy, not merely of papa and mamma, but also of our
                                                  communicative old general, his friend the G.C.B.,
                                                  and (all but most of any) the Laird of Glenmuir
                                                  and Glenmurdock, whose heart has been entirely
                                                  rejoiced by Charles Tracy having added to his
                                                  name, and to his children's names, that of
                                                  Stuart.</p>
                                                <p>Mr. and Mrs. Tracy Stuart are often at Glenmuir;
                                                  but oftener at Burleigh, where the general, I
                                                  fancy, still resides. He protests that he never
                                                  will keep a secret again: long may he live to say
                                                  so!</p>
