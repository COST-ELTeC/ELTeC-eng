                    <p><hi>THE</hi> life of almost every human being is governed by one master
                        thought—the life, we say, of human beings, not human vegetables, of which
                        many flourish in our soil, making a very goodly show, notwithstanding their
                        respectable unconsciousness of all but their material existence. Every
                        thinking mortal has a sovereign thought, to which all others are
                        subservient. Sometimes its nature causes it to be as a guardian angel to the
                        man, one that walks, serene and bright, side by side with his soul through
                        the tempests and the turmoil of life; on through the dark valley where
                            the<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7183-003"/> great shadow lies, and beyond it,
                        perhaps, where our eyes follow not.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes its mission seems to be that of a demon, and its foul presence
                        follows the spirit through the glittering joys and the sunshine of life on
                        to the dark valley—and—with what a dread power beyond it, perhaps!</p>
                    <p>Now, the thought which had ruled the life and soul of John Forde for many
                        years past, looked very like an angel, not only long ago when it was clothed
                        with the beauty and brightness of hope, but even now when it came in its
                        mourning garments to brood over his heart that was as the grave of a dream
                        long dead. It was angel‐like still—for what is so bright or so fair of all
                        the fair things of earth, as sweet human love? and it was all the more
                        lovely to his soul that it had been so vain. We know how much more beautiful
                        in death the treasures seem to grow which we have cherished for their living
                        beauty. Yes, the deep love which was the master thought of<pb n="3"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-004"/> his existence, had ever seemed to him an angel,
                        but had he looked a little closer, he would have found that the demon’s mark
                        was upon it—for had it not taken his life and made it as sad, and useless,
                        and aimless as though it were a gift but given to be squandered away; and
                        had it not absorbed every higher faculty, and feeling, and desire of his
                        mind so entirely, that he lived exactly like a man who had never heard that
                        there was any other world than this, or any other existence save that which
                        was passing for him in such a dull, cold apathy.</p>
                    <p>What a strange, dreamy‐looking individual he seemed as he sat there gazing
                        intently on the fire which he had forgotten to replenish, and watching how
                        the flame appeared to feed even upon the ashes. There was a strong likeness
                        between himself and his Newfoundland dog, who was also engaged in a
                        meditative manner in looking at the dying embers; the expression and the
                        colour of their eyes was at least precisely the same, and the resemblance
                        was height‐ <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7183-005"/> ened by the long, black hair
                        which hung in much disorder round John Forde’s plain, but not inexpressive,
                        countenance.</p>
                    <p>He was very tall and ungainly, his great ill‐shaped hands and feet seemed not
                        to fit him properly, and his head was set uncomfortably on his shoulders. He
                        was wont to go about the world as if he could not conceive for what reason
                        he had been brought into it. He lived quite alone, holding no intercourse
                        with any one, and seeking the acquaintance of none: to all appearance he had
                        no occupation whatever, and he seemed always half asleep. In reality,
                        however, he had a most engrossing employment, which absorbed him entirely.
                        From morning till night did he sit day‐dreaming, weaving golden visions of
                        an impossible joy—none knew better than himself how impossible it was; but
                        that bright ideal was all that life could give him of happiness now, and he
                        learnt to lose himself in these glowing fancies so completely, that he had
                        well nigh forgotten the truth of his existence.<pb n="5"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-006"/> The reality was cold and objectless and dark, for
                        he had known no other sunshine save the light of one sweet smile, and that
                        had passed away, and therefore he ever fled from it to the visionary world
                        he had made, where he could call back that vanished brightness from the far
                        vista of the past, and in the inner chambers of his soul he had built, as it
                        were, a dwelling for the fair image which was his idol, and there night and
                        day he communed with her.</p>
                    <p>It was strange to what an extent his abstraction from the things of sense had
                        arrived; he was scarce conscious of external circumstances, and long habit
                        had so increased his power of imagination, that he would carry on the same
                        series of ideal scenes for days together, living over again in his dreams by
                        night what he fancied in his visions of the day, and only waking from them
                        to give a sort of sobbing sigh for their untruth, and then straightway
                        relapsing into their false enchantment.</p>
                    <p>He had lived for the last ten years in his<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7183-007"/>
                        present abode, which was a small and comfortable house, placed in one of the
                        quietest streets in London. It had come into his possession, along with a
                        moderate fortune which he had inherited from an uncle, whose death had thus
                        rendered him independent, and had saved him from the life of toil and
                        drudgery to which he seemed destined.</p>
                    <p>Previously to this event, John Forde had been private tutor in a family of
                        much respectability.</p>
                    <p>The night was chill and dark, for it was late in the month of October, and
                        wild gusts of wind and rain drove past the windows, whilst the decaying
                        light upon the hearth served only to render the room more cheerless; but
                        although the great dog occasionally looked wistfully round when the blast
                        howled with increasing violence, John Forde seemed unconscious of all that
                        was passing; his bodily presence was there, but his soul was far away. The
                        song of summer birds was in his ears, the scent of summer flowers in the
                            air,<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7183-008"/> the light of a laughing eye was
                        shining on Ms spirit, and his heart was beating high with the ardour of a
                        long‐departed youth. An old, well‐worn Latin Grammar lay open on his knees,
                        and from its pages he had been gleaning with the strange power of
                        association many a record of the bright days when he had studied that same
                        book with his young pupil; now in the deepening shadow the lines had grown
                        indistinct, and he had abandoned himself to a fair vision where she who had
                        looked with him upon. those pages was seated by his side once more, and the
                        holy bonds of an indissoluble union had melted away in his day‐dream as
                        though they had never been, while the wife and mother listened as a young
                        girl, fancy free, to his own pleading voice.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, as he sat there, the bell of the outer door was rung, apparently by
                        an impatient hand; for it sent a quick, sharp peal through the house. John
                        started involuntarily; he had literally not a friend in the world, so far as
                        he knew at least, and it was<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7183-009"/> an unusual hour
                        for any tradesman to have left his home. He did not move, however: it could
                        be nothing to interest him, for whom life had no interest, and he listened
                        quietly. He heard the door opened;—after a few minutes’ parley, in which he
                        distinguished only his servant’s voice, it closed again; and then there came
                        a sound of steps upon the stair: they fell heavily, but rapid and hurried,
                        as of one upon an urgent errand, yet at intervals they ceased entirely, as
                        though the person were unable to proceed.</p>
                    <p>What was there in that step, so heavy and uncertain, that brought back to him
                        with vivid startling power the remembrance of a day—one of the gladdest in
                        his life—when bounding along the green grass with feet light as the fleetest
                        fawn, he had seen a bright form come dancing towards him, and the sweet
                        ringing voice that now for ever was echoing deep in his soul, called him
                        gaily to come with her far into the woods, where she feared to stray alone?
                        What was there in the footfall on the stairs that night which<pb n="9"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-010"/> made him think of this?—why did he grow pale, and
                        shiver from head to foot, as though something unearthly were at hand?</p>
                    <p>His hands grasped the table for support; his head turned round mechanically,
                        his eyes fixed themselves upon the door; some one had paused behind it; he
                        could hear the quick breathing, the deep‐drawn sigh, as if the person were
                        utterly exhausted; a hand was placed upon the lock; he verily expected to
                        see a ghost come in, and was it not a ghost which entered? The ghost of
                        youth, and hope, and beauty, the ghost of a life that had been so full of
                        promise, and now was perishing in such dark night. It was a woman of some
                        thirty years of age. She looked as if she had just arisen from her dying
                        bed; and so in truth she had. Her face was ghastly livid, the fever spot
                        burning on her cheek, and the cold dew gathering on her brow. It seemed
                        extraordinary that she should have had strength to come there. She had been
                        beautiful—how beautiful the throbbing heart of poor John Forde could<pb
                            n="10" xml:id="VAB7183-011"/> best have told, but it was all gone now.
                        The large eyes were sunk in their hollow cavities, the features so thin and
                        sharp, the mouth so drawn and distorted with continued pain.</p>
                    <p>Yet he knew her at once. It was more than ten years since he had looked upon
                        that face, but still had he not seen it in his dreams every day, nay, every
                        hour? He saw no change in her; he only felt it was herself; he saw not that
                        some terrible disease was killing her—that some strange event must have
                        brought her there at such an hour—that some great agony must have nerved her
                        to leave her couch of sickness and come hither through the dark night with
                        the tempest raging round her; he thought nothing of all this; he forgot all,
                        save that he saw before him the living reality of that fair image which was
                        the star of all his visions.</p>
                    <p>He forgot who she was, and what he was himself, and all the changes which
                        these ten years had wrought for her, if not for him. He forgot that his
                        dreams were dreams, and he thought that the truth had<pb n="11"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-012"/> been a falsity, and that his own dear falsehood
                        was the truth. He thought that she had come to realize it all now, to reward
                        him for his deep, long, patient love; he wondered he had never seen it must
                        end thus, and that none could love so well and be for ever hated,—his heart
                        grew faint with joy, he stretched out his trembling hands towards her, his
                        voice faltered like that of a child when it proffers some request which it
                        desires intensely—but he murmured only, “Millicent, my Millicent, have you
                        come at last?”</p>
                    <p>And she answered with her sobs, deep, bursting sobs, that seemed as if they
                        would have carried away the little life that still was lingering in her
                        sinking frame. She wept for that faithful love, so despised and so
                        rejected—for her own past scorn in the pride of her happiness. She wept for
                        the days that were to come no more, when her heart was so full of hope she
                        had no thought for his despair, when the love she had chosen from the many
                        hearts offered to<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7183-013"/> her seemed so pure and so
                        true; she wept for the memories that crowded upon her—how she stood a happy
                        bride and cared naught for his anguish—and now, like the stricken bird with
                        the vulture pursuing, she came mourning to him for pity and help. Oh, her
                        youth and her bloom, her hope and her joy, where were they! The friends that
                        were round her had vanished away, and the husband that was more than the
                        world together, what had he become! She wept so bitterly she could not
                        stand,—all this time she had held in her arms a child, who was peacefully
                        sleeping,—she staggered towards a sofa, and laid it down; when he saw her
                        movement, he thought that she was going to leave him, that, as she had ever
                        done in the unreal visions where he had dwelt with her, she was about to
                        pass suddenly from before his eyes, and abandon him to his waking reality of
                        hopeless solitude.</p>
                    <p>He bounded towards her, but his feet were powerless to support him, so
                            bewil‐<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7183-014"/> dered and overcome was he with
                        intense emotion; he fell down, and grasping her dress, he clung to it as an
                        infant terrified to be left alone in the darkness clings to a mother’s
                        hand;—truly, it is a very awful thing, as well as a deadly sin, for an
                        immortal soul to deliver up its whole self to such love as this for any
                        earthly being.</p>
                    <p>“Do not leave me!” he gasped out. “Oh, you know not what days and nights I
                        have passed waiting for this hour—you know not the chill and the gloom of
                        this world without you. I deserve that you should stay with me, if ever
                        patient, longing, and bitter watching by the grave of the past where your
                        image lay entombed, and such faithfulness of heart as chose this solitude
                        with one deep thought of you, rather than all the pleasures life could give,
                        deserved compassion! Do not leave me! It cannot be that any human heart
                        should be so cruel as thus to come and thus to pass away.” His words were
                        incoherent, as he poured forth his entreaties, but<pb n="14"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-015"/> still with his clinging hands he held her
                        frantically.</p>
                    <p>She bent over him with a look intensely mournful, and murmured soothingly,
                        “My poor John—my poor, faithful friend!”</p>
                    <p>She did not remember that once before she had uttered these words in his
                        heating, these very words. It was on the morning of her wedding day;—as she
                        came down the stairs in her bridal dress to enter the carriage that was to
                        take her to the church,—her eye caught a glimpse of the pale, tear‐stained
                        face of the poor, despised tutor, whose mad and pertinacious attachment to
                        herself had hitherto only called forth her scorn and even ridicule. He was
                        cowering down amongst the crowd of servants and dependents who had assembled
                        to see her pass; he had hid himself behind them, that, unnoticed in this his
                        bitter hour, he might look for the last time on the face of his worshipped
                            idol—<emph>his worshipped idol</emph>! What words are these to be used
                        from human clay to human clay! Who shall say what judgment they will not<pb
                            n="15" xml:id="VAB7183-016"/> call down? who shall say what curse they
                        will not carry on to the third or fourth generation? yet will any affirm
                        that no such feeling was ever cherished for a fellow mortal? Let men look to
                        it who would so scorn the making of graven images and the exalting of carved
                        idols to worship them!—let them look to it whether the love of any earthly
                        thing hath not set itself up supreme in their affections, so that their
                        spirit bows before it, forgetting all other adoration.</p>
                    <p>He was there shivering from head to foot, his hands clasped tightly over his
                        heaving breast, his head bent forward, and his eyes, through gushing tears,
                        fixing on the young bride their most wistful gaze; for the first time she
                        was touched. She had ever treated him with the utmost haughtiness and
                        contempt, but she could not look unmoved on this extremity of anguish.
                        Perhaps some sympathetic chord was wakened by the latent power of suffering
                        not yet developed in her own young heart; but whatever prompted her, as she
                        passed him walking over the<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7183-017"/> flowers they
                        had strewn beneath her feet, she held out her hand to him, and said, “My
                        poor John—my poor faithful friend.” He could not touch her hand. he trembled
                        too much; so she passed on, and he saw her face no more; but the words rang
                        on his ears with an indestructible sound; they had lived with him through
                        these ten long years; he had heard them in his dreams last night, and now he
                        heard them again in actual reality.</p>
                    <p>They brought back the truth to his bewildered mind; the mists and the clouds
                        which his long habit of visionary life had gathered on his spirit, seemed to
                        clear away as that voice came sounding on his ear; the utter confusion which
                        her sudden appearance had caused in his thoughts, passed suddenly from him.
                        He knew and remembered all. He raised himself up, and with a shaking hand
                        brushed the tears from his eyes, and then he looked on her; he saw and
                        understood who she was. These many years she had been the wife of another
                        man, of one whom she had loved as he loved her!<pb n="17"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-018"/> and yet more,—had none other ever come to gain
                        the precious gift of her dear love, it had availed him nothing. Those
                        conventional, unrighteous laws which men have made as barriers, raised to
                        ward off from them their kind, had placed a gulf between the proud,
                        beautiful heiress and himself. He knew and felt it all; he had boldly won
                        her to himself in his sweet dreams; he had chosen to forget that ever she
                        was other than the fair, young girl of his early days, but in actual life he
                        knew how it must be—the requirements of the world’s code of virtues exacted
                        from him an outward conformity to the circumstances of their outward
                        position; this it required, that in appearance he should seek no part in the
                        existence of that wedded wife, but with this much it would be well
                        content;—it would ask no reason of a ten years’ longing for an unpermitted
                        lot, of a ten years’ coveting of a happiness denied; of a ten years’
                        cherishing of an unauthorized affection. It was enough if, in the sight of
                            men,<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7183-019"/> he had resigned himself to his
                        appointed destiny; if outwardly he had made no murmuring for the treasure
                        taken from him; if he had never so much as sought to look again on that
                        which never could be his; not only would men say this was enough, but they
                        would talk with admiration, possibly, of his long, patient, silent, hopeless
                        love. They would say it was a noble thing to see how true a human heart
                        could be, how constant, even in despair! Oh, false teaching of a most unholy
                        world! And was the love permitted? And what availed the conformity of
                        outward seeming when the heart was thus rebellious; and because John Forde
                        had never breathed a word or moved a step to gain the idol of his life, was
                        it less in him a heavy sin so to crave for a happiness refused, and not
                        alone refused by distinct and high decree, but made a thing he had no right
                        to crave for? and because he was so patient and so humble, and so quiet, was
                        he less an arrogant, presumptuous rebel who gave the soul and heart<pb
                            n="19" xml:id="VAB7183-020"/> that should have worshipped nought on
                        earth, to be an offering to such human dust! Ah! that fair outward veil of a
                        world’s virtue—veiling what hideousness!—it may serve right well to clothe
                        the flesh until we reach the grave‐door, but there, where the flesh itself
                        must be stripped off; woe to the soul that has no better garment for the
                        covering of its unholiness than this! But John Forde remembered with the
                        words she had uttered, what the Millicent of his early love was to him in
                        the world’s sight, and mechanically he drew back and murmured, hesitatingly,
                        “Mrs. Grey.”</p>
                    <p>She sighed heavily. “Yes, it is even so, it is I—myself; but the hour is
                        passing, and my time is short, how short, alas! alas! in every way. I came
                        here with an earnest purpose, and it must be fulfilled, and I have little
                        strength, and much, so much to say; will you listen, patiently, my good,
                        dear, John, as in that happy, olden time?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Millicent, Millicent!” he said, and trembled violently.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7183-021"/>
                    <p>“Do you remember,“ she went on, with a smile more sad than ever dying sunbeam
                        on a fading autumn sky, “you called me your queen in those bright days! and
                        all I ever wished for was done by you, almost before I knew my own thoughts
                        had desired it.”</p>
                    <p>“And so it shall be still,” he said. “All that I was to you when we last met,
                        I still must be, not now alone, but ever while I live and breathe. I am
                        unchanged, most miserable that I am, unchanged!”</p>
                    <p>“I knew it,” she answered, sadly; “some instinct told me so, but I must tell
                        you why I came, and my strength is failing. There is One waiting for me who
                        will admit of no delay. And Death himself must not stop the words upon my
                        lips till you have heard my one petition and granted it, if for the dying
                        woman you indeed can feel what once was felt for the blooming girl; sit
                        there,” she continued, “and I must be at your feet, for I am come a
                        suppliant.”</p>
                    <p>He took the chair to which she pointed, apparently scarce knowing what he
                        did, for<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7183-022"/> he was stunned by the events of
                        the last half hour, and truly such an interview, breaking in upon the
                        solitude and silence of so many years, might well have bewildered a stronger
                        mind than his; he seemed now to have no power but to look upon her face and
                        listen to her voice. She took a low seat and placed herself upon it at his
                        feet.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> firelight gleamed on the face of the dying woman as she sat
                        there, and showed how very near death she really was. She had fortified
                        herself with some powerful stimulant for this exertion, but it was clear
                        that its effect would not last long; she had taken off her bonnet, and her
                        hair falling loosely round her denoted that she had risen in much haste from
                        her sick bed. The large cloak with which she had sought to screen herself
                        from the wind and rain was of some coarse material, evidently<pb n="23"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-024"/> chosen as a disguise; she held it with one hand
                        folded over her breast, that rose and fell with the convulsive heavings of
                        fever. What a contrast she was to the bright and joyous bride John Forde
                        last recollected her! Then she stood so radiant and so blooming in her fair
                        white robes, on the threshold of a life of promise, with sunny hope and joy
                        as handmaids at her side,—now she stood on the threshold of another life
                        unto whose promise she dared not look, and her attendants were in mourning
                        garments—deep penitence and deep remorse.</p>
                    <p>She sat leaning her head on her hand; looking up into his face with her
                        mournful eyes—mournful as are only the eyes of the dying, or of those who,
                        living, weep that they have not died more utterly to all the evil they
                        abhor. The sight of John Forde seemed to have recalled so many memories of
                        her happy youth, that when she spoke it was musingly, as though she were but
                        communing with herself.</p>

                        hands and say, ‘I am free; I will make of it what I please. I will play what
                        game with it I will—it is for myself alone. I will seek happiness in my own
                        way, and if I fail I alone shall suffer.’ You said, one might perhaps with
                        impunity risk suffering, but not sin,—and I risked both and have escaped
                        from neither; poor father, you strove to struggle then with my heart’s deep
                        love—you might as well have striven to fathom or to stem the wild waters of
                        the sea. You said that noble, talented, fair to all eyes, as was my lover,
                        William Grey, it never would prosper me to be his wife; for that he was one
                        who scoffed at holy things, who only sought to drink deep draughts of this
                        life’s pleasure, whose heart was full of idols—and himself unto himself the
                        chief. You said that none could touch the burning flame and<pb n="25"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-026"/> be unscathed—none be wedded to corruption and
                        remain unsullied; and I said that because he scoffed I need not
                        scoff—because he sinned I need not sin—but rather I would lead him right.
                        Alas, alas! and where has he led me!” She bowed her head upon her hands for
                        a few minutes, and then suddenly looked up.</p>
                    <p>“John, I would not have you think I love him, my husband, less than in that
                        hour when I told my poor, fond father, in all the pride of my rebellious,
                        selfish will, that I would be his wife, or never that of mortal man. No, I
                        will say, as you said even now, I am unchanged, most miserable that I am,
                        unchanged; nor yet would I have you think he led me wilfully to any evil. My
                        outward life has been unstained and bright; the world will tell you I have
                        been a blameless wife and mother, most assiduous in my little pleasing
                        duties, most courteous, most benevolent; and it is very true—I have been all
                        this, and more—I never injured any, I<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7183-027"/> have
                        striven to relieve and comfort some; I never murmured when he slighted and
                        neglected me; but if you would know the crime for which I suffer now in
                        bitter penitence, it was but this—I forgot there was a heaven or a hell. He
                        loved the world so fondly, he taught me to love it fondly too; and it is a
                        jealous world, it must have the whole heart or none at all—it had all mine!
                        He arranged our plan of life, that it should be one ever varying scene of
                        pleasure and amusement. We had wealth at our command, surrounding us with
                        every luxury, making us forget that there was suffering or evil anywhere.
                        Ah, that prosperity, how terrible a snare it is!”</p>
                    <p>She had spoken these last sentences in a dreamy, musing tone, rolling herself
                        to and fro as if in pain, and John Forde sat listening to her with large
                        tears, of which he was all unconscious, stealing down his cheeks; her voice
                        was so very sad, so like to the rise and fall of the sighing wind on<pb
                            n="27" xml:id="VAB7183-028"/> a dreary night, none could have heard it
                        unmoved—how far less could he! Suddenly the little child who lay sleeping on
                        the sofa, moved in its slumber, and slightly moaned.</p>
                    <p>The mother started at the sound, as if a voice had called her angrily; her
                        pale cheek crimsoned; her eye sparkled with a sudden energy; she clasped her
                        hands like one who asks forgiveness.</p>
                    <p>“My child, my child! that any thought of other days, that any memory of
                        departed hope, sweet though it be, should lead me to forget how on this hour
                        hangs your whole life’s destiny! Alas, to think that one could be so weak as
                        thus to sit dreaming by the side of her own yawning grave!” She turned and
                        raised herself so that she was almost kneeling before him.</p>
                    <p>“John, I need not tell you that I am sinking under a mortal disease—that the
                        grasp of death is tightening on my heart most rapidly—that a few days must
                        terminate my life. It is therefore the petition of a dying woman that I
                        beseech of you to<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7183-029"/> grant—of one who never
                        will live to ask another. Listen, then, while I tell you briefly, as those
                        must speak for whom the worms await, what is my heart’s desire—the desire
                        you alone can grant. To explain it, you must know that my husband, not
                        content with luxury and dissipation, and a life wherein no master was
                        acknowledged but his own corrupt and lawless will, soon passed to deeper
                        shades of crime. There is no standing still, no passive inaction for the
                        soul! On, on, by the steep ascent and the toilsome path, from a longing
                        after purity unto the purity itself, or downward by the smooth alluring way
                        from indifference to forgetfulness, from forgetfulness to hate; and it was
                        so with him. He hates now all that is not evil. Gambling, revelry, and the
                        allurements of sin in every shape, have gotten him in their possession. My
                        house from day to day is filled with those who live but for the pleasures of
                        the world; and there is one among them with a face as fair as her hidden
                        soul is black, to whom he will<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7183-030"/> give my
                        place when I am gone. I know it—know it well.” She bowed her head, and the
                        deep sobs burst forth again; but soon driving back the burning tears, she
                        went on:</p>
                    <p>“I took pleasure in that society; I made my joy and my delight in that
                        brilliant life of gaiety for many years; I never thought of looking what
                        depths might be beneath that sparkling surface; I never thought of saying to
                        my spirit, Is all well with thee? art thou ready when the dark‐winged angel
                        comes? But at last he did come whose office is to strip the covering of
                        beauty from all deceitful things. Death came, and then I learnt to know what
                        I had been so long, and am. I must not tell you of myself—he leaves me not
                        the time. I must not tell you all that I would give to stand once more
                        beside you as I stood upon my wedding morning, a bride, not yet a wife;
                        knowing so little evil, an innocent girl in an honourable, quiet home, with
                        that good old father warding off unhallowed things. How would I tear away
                        the bridal veil, and fling aside the<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7183-031"/> bridal
                        robe, and betake me to the sackcloth and the ashes, if beneath them I could
                        keep my heart in purity. No, I must tell you only of one deep thought that
                        came as it were hand in hand with death, and that has eaten into my very
                        soul since then. It is for my child—my little angel child—pure as the
                        stainless lily, guileless and sportive as the tender lamb—it is for her—that
                        she may never, never live as I have lived, and never come to be what I now
                        am. But I am dying. Who will watch her?—who will guard her?—who will save
                        her—save her from her father!—yes, from him! Do you know what he once said?
                        It was one day after I knew that I was going fast where the soul can make to
                        itself no fair deception, that suddenly my love for him, unquenchable, came
                        swelling so strongly through my heart, I could not bear that he should risk
                        such perishing, and I flung my arms round him, and besought him, with many
                        an imploring word and truthful argument, to think on all that was to come;
                        but oh! with what<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7183-032"/> bitter anger did he fling
                        me from him, and ask if I were mad, to speak such hateful folly in his ears;
                        and then—he well knew how best to be revenged on me. He took my child, my
                        little child, and held her in his arms, as though for a witness to his oath,
                        and swore that in her, at least, he would have no canting hypocrite, that
                        she should never so much as hear the things that were so odious to him. A
                        merry life should she lead—no fear of aught before her eyes! And
                            <emph>she</emph> to whom he will give my place when I am gone, she, too,
                        was there, and said, with such a smile, it were well, in truth, for once to
                        educate a child free from the foolish trammels and the needless burden of a
                        faith and a required duty;—and I helpless in my shroud, what should I
                        do?</p>
                    <p>“Oh, John, dear John, my agony was very great for many days, and then the
                        thought of you came like a sunbeam to my soul—of you, my faithful, truest
                        friend; for you must save her, you must take her,<pb n="32"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-033"/> you must guard her from her father. Yes, my child
                        must be stolen from her father; there is no other means. Whole days and
                        nights I have lain and thought upon it, racking my very soul to find a
                        method of escape for her—and there is none save this. I know not if it be
                        not in itself a crime to steal a child from its surviving parent—I have no
                        power now to discern between right and wrong; I only know she must not stay
                        with him, he would fulfill his impious oath! for his soul’s ease he
                        would,—that none might ever warn him. Oh, she must not stay with him; she
                        must never breathe the atmosphere of that unhappy house, my most unhallowed
                        home; she must be taken now in her young innocence, and reared as the
                        spotless snowdrop in some hidden nook, where no polluting breath shall ever
                        stain my snow‐white flower; and you must take her, John, dear John,—there is
                        none other who could conceal her from her father. I have arranged it all—you
                        shall have no trouble<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7183-034"/> —my fortune is
                        secured to her—and I will leave a letter for her aunt, a letter to be given
                        when I am buried,—for none refuse the dead who cry to them,—telling her all
                        the truth, and praying her to watch, though at a distance, over my sweet
                        child, and never to reveal her residence until her father’s death—then she
                        will take her from you, John, and you shall be free again,—only that my
                        spirit will continue still to bless you. Oh, I scarce can speak with the
                        intensity of my desire; say that you will grant my prayer, dear John, my
                        dying prayer, speak peace to my poor aching heart; you know not how I love
                        that child. They say the dead will rest whatever be; I think that I could
                        rest whatever passed on earth, excepting it were that little one in danger.
                        Ah, tempt me not to take her with me, to brand my soul undying with the
                        stain of murder, and thus to save hers from contamination; tempt me not to
                        this, but take her, take her now this night—to‐morrow, go with<pb n="34"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-035"/> her across the sea, to some far distant country,
                        where her father and her father’s wife shall never hear of her. There guard
                        her in innocence, in holiness, in peace, and such blessings as a mother’s
                        heart alone could conceive in recompense shall, with my dying breath, be
                        yours.”</p>
                    <p>She had spoken with such exceeding vehemence, her abrupt and rapid utterance
                        had gained such energy from the fever raging in her veins, that now the
                        false strength went from her utterly: she sank down breathless, panting, and
                        exhausted.</p>
                    <p>As for John Forde, his whole frame was shaking with emotion; that she should
                        have been so wretched, that she should come praying to him for succour, that
                        she should doubt his willingness to die for her—all these thoughts filled
                        his heart to bursting, and he could not speak. At length she lifted up her
                        face; she knew not what his silence meant, and the anguish of suspense was
                        most unbearable. Her countenance showed that the exertions of<pb n="35"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-036"/> this night had greatly shortened her brief
                        remaining life; her eyes had brightened as though all the soul had gathered
                        there, but the pale lips could scarcely articulate.</p>
                    <p>“Speak—say—will you—will you grant my prayer, and save my child?” She joined
                        her hands, and lifted them in supplication; “for the sake of the dear love
                        wherewith you loved me in brighter days!”</p>
                    <p>The look which he gave her was describable; there was in it such a world of
                        unutterable affection, of mournful reproach, of anguish for her suffering
                        most intense, but because of the very depth and strength of the feelings
                        struggling in his heart, his answer was very simple, “Are you not,
                        Millicent?”</p>
                    <p>It was enough, quite enough; she rose at once, and going to the sofa she
                        knelt down beside her child and laid her pale brow, damp with the dews of
                        death, upon the little, soft hands folded in that sleep of guilelessness;
                        and then no sound was heard<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7183-037"/> save the
                        infant’s gentle breathing, that sounded not as if this life could ever make
                        it swell out to a bitter sigh. When she rose she was very calm, but spent
                        and worn, she spoke with difficulty.</p>
                    <p>“I am so feeble, I think death is at hand, and the little strength I have,
                        must now be given to take me home; they must not know I ever left it. I said
                        I would be alone, that I wished to sleep a few hours quietly; I bade them
                        come again at midnight, and so they went, and I stole softly out and came on
                        wandering hither. Thankful I am I came to find such peace—oh, thankful as no
                        words can say; but now I must return, that they may find me when they
                        come—her they will not find, and never shall. Oh, joy unspeakable!—Her old
                        nurse is below, a faithful creature, whom I trust entirely; she loves me
                        well, and she will go with you wherever you may take my child. She will tell
                        you all, better far than I can now. My words must be few, for he is
                        devouring the breath upon my lips; say once again,<pb n="37"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-038"/> dear John, that you will take her from this city
                        and this land to‐morrow.”</p>
                    <p>And he answered at once, “To‐morrow!” but as he saw her raise those eyes so
                        peaceful, now that they were beautiful once more, with a long, fixed gaze of
                        thankfulness, and then move slowly to depart, he suddenly rose with
                        convulsive energy from his place. His breath came thick and fast from his
                        labouring chest, his eyes were wild with their look of terror. The
                        concentrated anguish of that moment could scarcely find vent in words; he
                        only said, “Millicent, do not go,” but he grasped her arm at the same time
                        with a strength of which he was unconscious. She saw at once, that unless
                        she had power to overcome his overwhelming emotion, a scene would ensue
                        which must kill her; gently she took his hand, calmly she looked into his
                        face, and the mild gaze of her dear eyes soothed him. Softly she spoke in a
                        low, sweet voice, “John, I know it is a sad thing for you that I should go,
                        very sad that I should die, but you have<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7183-039"/>
                        deepest comfort in knowing how strangely happy you have made that death, and
                        you can make it happier still, you can brighten yet more the dark way for
                        me—you will, I know you will, when I have told you how. Dear John, when we
                        last parted I went with a smile and you with tears, and often since, those
                        tears of yours have fallen on my spirit very bitterly; their recollection
                        filled me with remorse, and now, to‐night, I have wept many such, and your
                        kind hand has wiped them all away; let me see you smile then as I go forth.
                        Let me think no more with vain regret upon your bitter weeping for my scorn
                        and cruel neglect; let me carry with me the remembrance of your smile,
                        because to‐day I have acknowledged all your faithfulness and truth, and
                        thanked and blessed you for it; it will lighten the shadows deepening round
                        me in mysterious gloom, if I can remember the last look of your face in
                        gladness. Smile on me, good, dear John, and so shall be our kind
                        farewell,”</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7183-040"/>
                    <p>He had never disobeyed her, nor did he now, but there are no words to say
                        what that obedience cost him. He looked on her and smiled; her own face
                        brightened strangely as she met his gaze—she stooped till her cold lips
                        touched his hand, then pointed to the sleeping child, and so going forth she
                        left them both and went her way. He never looked upon her face again.</p>

                    <p><hi>A SUMMER’S</hi> evening in Provence—what a bright, sweet vision these
                        words bring up before the memory of those who know that smiling land! such a
                        breathless, cloudless beauty over earth and sky, such a softness in the
                        breeze that steals along, wandering to find the orange flowers and rob them
                        of their fragrance; such a brightness in the lingering of the sunset and in
                        the dawning of the moon and stars, and over all so calm and soothing a
                        repose; an intensity of rest<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7183-042"/> and quiet best
                        suited to those who, in the decline of life, are fain to take their ease in
                        stillness after the long, sore journey, or who, in the decline of hope, are
                        weary of the world’s tumult, and would be alone to see if their own heart
                        can tell them nothing better; that evening’s quietude, however, was by no
                        means congenial to the gay, young girl who sat there beneath the
                        olive‐trees. It was in a large garden attached to one of the best houses in
                        the quaint old town of Aix, a pleasant spot, not far from the noble church,
                        whose deep bell, tolling nightly, failed not to send its solemn echoes
                        through those quiet bowers.</p>
                    <p>Millicent Grey had never known another home; at least she remembered none
                        save this, and every object which surrounded her was most familiar; her
                        great, restless eyes, sparkling with the first ardour of youth and hope,
                        went ranging impatiently from side to side as if in search of something new.
                        At last she turned and fixed them on the old French bonne who sat in state
                        before her as<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7183-043"/> her appointed companion.
                        There was something irresistibly attractive in this little old woman: she
                        was so neat, so trim, in her pretty Provencâl costume. Her small, piercing
                        black eyes twinkled with an expression of such comical merriment, though set
                        in a countenance which certainly was uncommonly ugly, whilst her wide mouth,
                        with its range of splendid white teeth, gave evidence of the most determined
                        good humour. She sat knitting some indescribable piece of work with
                        extraordinary speed, and every now and then looked up at her young charge
                        with a gay, happy smile, which had in it no particular meaning, but was only
                        designed to express her perfect contentment with the world in general.
                        Millicent looked at her for a long time: then suddenly starting from her
                        seat she threw herself down on the grass at her feet, and taking her by the
                        two hands, exclaimed—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Nanette, Nanette,—how I wish you would change your face!”</p>
                    <p>“Ma chérie!” said the old woman in<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7183-044"/>
                        astonishment, and then laughed merrily; “and why?”</p>
                    <p>“Because it is always the same face, every day the same, it never tells me
                        anything new—nothing ever does; everything goes on the same.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah bien, mais que veux tu? I would do anything to amuse you, but as to this
                        —” She shrugged her shoulders with a comical grimace.</p>
                    <p>“No, no,” said Millicent, putting her arms round her. “I was joking, good
                        Nanette, I would not change your dear, old face, not even if I could, I lave
                        it much too well—no—but I know what I do wish,” she added, with a sigh.</p>
                    <p>“And what is it?” asked Nanette, “sure you shall have it if it is not quite
                        so impossible as the last.”</p>
                    <p>“That I am sure it is,” said Millicent, “so I need not think about it; but
                        what I should like would be that some one should come here, some one very
                        grave and wise and good,—some one from England, I fancy<pb n="44"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-045"/> they are very wise there—that such a person
                        should come and answer all the questions I would put to him.”</p>
                    <p>“And what would you ask?” said Nanette.</p>
                    <p>“What would I ask? Oh, everything; there is so much that bewilders and
                        confuses me. I want to find out the meaning of the whole world, and the
                        reason and purpose of all that goes on in it. You do not understand me,
                        Nanette, and I do not think I quite understand myself; but I go living here
                        all alone, so to speak, from day to day with such strange, restless thoughts
                        working in me, that I scarce can bear it. Uncle Forde never talks to me, and
                        I know all you could tell me, Nanette dear, which is not much; and
                        everything I read and see only shows me the outward surface, it tells me
                        that things are so, such life and death, and joy and sorrow, but it never
                        tells me <emph>why</emph>! I am sure, in all existence, there is a hidden
                        reason which I cannot penetrate.”</p>
                    <p>“And why should you, my mignonne? At<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7183-046"/> sixteen
                        one ought to find out only the best way to amuse one’s self. Ah, when I was
                        sixteen—”</p>
                    <p>“You liked singing and dancing as well as I do now, did you not, chère
                        Nanette? Well, but one cannot dance and sing all one’s life; one did not
                        come into the world for that alone, because then what would be the use of
                        all the old, stiff people. Now, that is precisely what puzzles me, that is
                        the very first question I should like to ask my wise man if he would only
                        come; I want to know what we are all living for! What is the use of life?
                        What are we to do with it now we have got it?”</p>
                    <p>“Ah bien,” said Nanette, looking quite bewildered; “and what does every one
                        do with it?”</p>
                    <p>“What do they do with it? Why, they eat, and they drink, and they sleep, and
                        they take a great deal of trouble to keep themselves alive now they are
                        living, but then I say, what for? pourquoi? what is the use of living only
                        to keep ourselves alive?”</p>
                    <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7183-047"/>
                    <p>“Sais‐je moi,” said Nanette, shrugging her shoulders; “but no, my petite, we
                        do more than eating and sleeping; look, I am knitting!”</p>
                    <p>“Very well, so you are; now then, let us analyze the knitting. I am not going
                        to touch it, don’t be afraid, I am only going to pull it morally to pieces.
                        This piece of knitting, what is it?”</p>
                    <p>“Why, a stocking, and that is very useful, I am sure; it will keep my feet
                        warm.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, but you are obliged to keep your feet warm, because you are alive; you
                        don’t live to keep your feet warm.”</p>
                    <p>This sort of reasoning was quite bewildering to Nanette: she looked comically
                        at her work for a few minutes as if she ought to be disgusted with it, but
                        its hold on her affections was far too firm. She gave a careless smile,
                        seeming to intimate that, however unworthy, her knitting must ever be dear
                        to her, and taking it up again, plied her needles vigorously. Millicent went
                        on, “It is the same in everything; now when M. le<pb n="47"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-048"/> Roux died last year, his wife came here making
                        such lamentations. Oh, he was such a loss, what would the world do without
                        him; a man of such taste, such an elegant mind, and always busy, never idle
                        a moment; he had built that great house and laid out those beautiful
                        grounds; he had superintended the placing of every stone himself. It had
                        taken him ever so many years, but it was a charming place to live in when it
                        was done, and then he had grown so used to the occupation, that after the
                        house was finished he kept adding room upon room only for employment. Well,
                        M. le Roux spent all his life there in making himself a place to live in,
                        and died of old age when it was about ready; his wife married and they sold
                        the house, and even M. le Roux’s bones did not get a comfortable grave
                        there. So I just ask you, Nanette, don’t you think M. le Roux might quite as
                        well not have lived at all?”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, poor M. Le Roux!” said Nanette, deprecatingly.</p>
                    <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7183-049"/>
                    <p>“Bien! but there was also young Adolphe, who was thrown from his horse and
                        killed; what a state every one was in about him, how they all said it was
                        such a misfortune, such a fine young man, any one could have been better
                        spared; but what did M. Adolphe ever do, excepting play billiards and try to
                        valser à deux temps? What was the good of his living? What was the use of
                        him?”</p>
                    <p>“My dear,” said Nanette, imposingly, with the air of a person who is sure of
                        her position; “the père André has often told me nothing was ever made
                        without a use.”</p>
                    <p>“Then I wish some one would tell me my use,” said Millicent, with a sigh;
                        “for here I go on eating and sleeping and living, for no purpose that I can
                        see.”</p>
                    <p>“I will tell you what,” said Nanette, briskly; “the use of living is that we
                        may be happy, which we could not be unless we were alive. I am sure it is
                        that; I am convinced of ”</p>
                    <p>“Well, I could understand, that,” ex‐<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7183-050"/>
                        claimed Millicent, “for it is such a charming thing to feel so happy as I do
                        sometimes. But then every one is not happy—nor any one always, not even you
                        and I, Nanette; and look at Uncle Forde, what a wretched man he is. And
                        then, again, to be happy, there is a something wanting, I don’t know what it
                        is, a something which one’s inmost heart requires, and which nothing
                        external can procure. One cannot sit down and say—now I am going to be so
                        happy, I am determined to be so very happy—you may be sure one would feel
                        terribly discontented if one did. There is a vacancy, a restlessness in
                        one’s spirit, which is not satisfied with only a pleasant aspect to the
                        outer world. I cannot understand it.”</p>
                    <p>She turned suddenly, and raising her bright young face, to which some earnest
                        thought had given a look of gravity quite foreign to her usual expression,
                        she said, in a low tone:—</p>
                    <p>“Nanette, I am certain of this; there<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7183-051"/> is a
                        secret in life which I do not comprehend, and perhaps never shall.”</p>
                    <p>Nanette stooped to kiss her fondly, and then smoothing the flowing hair that
                        shaded the young girl’s face, she said:—</p>
                    <p>“I cannot bear that you should not know everything you want to know, my
                        darling. Why don’t you ask M. Forde? Perhaps he could tell you. He must
                        surely grow very wise, sitting so silent, thinking all day long. It makes me
                        go to sleep to look at him; so he must be very leaned, for I always go to
                        sleep when I read a grave book. I should ask him, if I were you; perhaps he
                        could explain it all.”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps he could,” said Millicent, thoughtfully. “It is worth the trial, at
                        all events. I will go to him.”</p>
                    <p>She returned the embrace of the old bonne with warm affection, and bounding
                        across the garden, entered the house: then very gently and quietly she
                        opened the door, and stole into the room where she knew she should find her
                        guardian.</p>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7183-052"/>
                    <p>His hands folded on his knee, his eyes fixed, his bead drooping on his
                        breast, John Forde sat in exactly the same attitude as we saw him fourteen
                        years before, when the dying mother of the young girl who now stood by his
                        side, came, in her last extremity, to implore the succour of him she had so
                        despised.</p>
                    <p>The singular plan which she had adopted in order to save her child from that
                        most unnatural misfortune, a father’s evil influence, had been strangely
                        successful; at least, in so far as that Millicent Grey had been conveyed
                        from England the very next day, and had remained at Aix ever since, without
                        having held the slightest communication with Mr. Grey. The letter which Mrs.
                        Grey had written to Mrs. Egerton, her half‐sister, on behalf of the child
                        over whom she could watch no more, had produced its full effect, as she
                        expected. Mrs. Egerton was not a person to lend her assistance willingly to
                        any project that looked romantic, or to burden herself<pb n="52"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-053"/> any more duties than those which her position in
                        life imposed upon her, and which she most ably performed, at least so she
                        was wont to certify herself by many significant hints. But an appeal from
                        the grave is never unheeded: there are scarce any who could dare to slight
                        it, albeit unconscious of the motive which constrains them so scrupulously
                        to perform to the very letter the last wishes of the departed. They believe
                        that they are thus careful because they consider it a sacred duty (how
                        sacred in truth they little know), but were they to analyze their feelings a
                        little more closely, they would find that they were chiefly actuated by a
                        superstitious dread, an unacknowledged terror that their midnight rest would
                        be disturbed by the pale phantom, whose wishes they had neglected, coming to
                        gaze on them with reproachful eyes, because they had no compassion for the
                        great helplessness of death.</p>
                    <p>Whatever might have been Mrs. Egerton’s motives, however, she was determined
                            rigidly<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7183-054"/> to follow the instructions of
                        her dying sister with regard to Millicent Grey. The letter informed her that
                        Aix was to be the place of the child’s abode, and charged her most carefully
                        to conceal all knowledge of the fact from her father. There was to be a
                        regular correspondence between John Forde and Mrs. Egerton, so that she
                        might always be certain that the child was well cared for, and at the death
                        of Mr. Grey, whenever that might occur, she was entreated to receive
                        Millicent into her own home. Should she die herself first, another relation
                        was to be appointed to undertake the charge, for which the fortune secured
                        to the young girl could give an ample remuneration. But Mrs. Grey plainly
                        foresaw that a life so dissipated and reckless as that of her husband could
                        not be greatly prolonged. She herself survived only a few days after her
                        interview with John Forde, and it was some time before Mr. Grey rightly
                        understood that she had really taken means to place the child out<pb n="54"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-055"/> of his reach. His anger was at first excessive;
                        but having ascertained, as he was enabled to do without much difficulty,
                        that she had been established somewhere on the continent, he found it would
                        be a great deal of trouble to have her restored to himself, and gradually he
                        ceased to wish it. The care of a young child was by no means a duty
                        congenial to his tastes, and in process of time he almost forgot her
                        existence, excepting to wish, when he found himself a ruined man, that he
                        could obtain possession of the fortune Millicent inherited from her mother.
                        He married again, as the instinct of the neglected wife’s affection had
                        prophesied, and his bride was even less than himself disposed to undertake
                        the burden of a step‐daughter’s education.</p>
                    <p>Thus John Forde remained perfectly unmolested with his young charge; and no
                        change whatever had occurred in their position since the first day that he
                        established himself at Aix with the little infant whom he diplomatically
                        called his niece.</p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7183-056"/>
                    <p>For the first few years he imagined himself exonerated from making any
                        attempt to educate her. He left her entirely to the motherly care of
                        Nanette, who had replaced the English nurse soon after their arrival, and
                        only took measures every day to ascertain that she was alive, and likely to
                        live. He had recourse to various extraordinary expedients in order to
                        convince himself of this fact, sometimes making the most horrible grimaces,
                        in order that the frightened child might attest to the strength of her lungs
                        by loud screams of terror, or else giving vent to an unearthly howl, that he
                        might have the comfort of seeing her run vigorously away. With some one such
                        effort made every day he acquitted himself to his own satisfaction of his
                        duties as guardian for a considerable time. At last, however, several
                        startling remarks made by Millicent began to awaken him to the fact that she
                        was fast advancing out of infancy, and that it was absolutely necessary to
                        give her some instruction. It was now that John was sorely perplexed;<pb
                            n="56" xml:id="VAB7183-057"/> he was nearly certain that something ought
                        to come before all the Latin and mathematics with which he proposed to
                        enlighten her ultimately, but he vainly endeavoured to discover what was the
                        first branch of science in which young ladies were usually instructed. To
                        his infinite relief, however, when he came to examine into the matter, he
                        found that Nanette had taken it into her own hands, and that she had already
                        taught the child to read and write, to embroider, and to sing with a voice
                        sweet and clear as the notes of a wild spring bird.</p>
                    <p>Soon after, he was also further relieved from his responsibility by the
                        intervention of a very clever and amiable French lady, whose little daughter
                        was Millicent’s playmate, and who, compassionating the neglected condition
                        of the clever English child, proposed to John that his niece should take
                        lessons along with her own little girls from the various masters whose
                        services she considered necessary. He was too happy to agree to this plan,
                        and the result<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7183-058"/> was, that Millicent, at
                        sixteen, had all the accomplishments which the world requires from persons
                        in her station, and withal a great deal of curious information in the
                        abstruser sciences, for which she was indebted to the teaching of John
                        himself. She was naturally clever; and with a fund of vivacity and
                        light‐heartedness she also combined great depth of thought, and an active
                        penetrating mind; but there was one peculiarity in her education which was
                        destined to have a most powerful influence on her whole future destiny.
                        Whilst ample learning was given her to supply her intellectual wants as an
                        inhabiter of this world, her young earnest soul was altogether shut out from
                        the vast range of spiritual knowledge.</p>
                    <p>A fitting teacher truly, in the faith of an immortal soul, would John Forde
                        have been, who had never known any other worship save the idolatry of heart
                        wherewith he bowed himself before the creature of clay; for it mattered not
                        what he professed himself—of professors we have enough; and very fair and
                        angel‐like this race of man<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7183-059"/> would be if
                        only the hidden spirit, sullied and dust‐cleaving, had some little affinity
                        with that universal profession; but we do not make poison into wine by
                        putting a label on the bottle to that effect. It had never occurred to John
                        Forde to think what he really was in this respect himself; his soul chained
                        to its human idol had no power to look around or upward; but in considering
                        the education of Millicent Grey, it did strike him that the faith of her
                        fathers was one of the things she must be taught. Well, he would teach it to
                        her. This was easily done. It should take its course along with other
                        sciences.</p>
                    <p>There were several standard works which gave her the various doctrines in
                        their regular order; and he had found her so apt a scholar, when he
                        instructed her in the rudiments of chemistry and astronomy, that he doubted
                        not she would learn religion without much trouble. He taught it to her as a
                        species of moral mathematics; and so soon as she was thoroughly conversant
                        with the leading principles—accurate in her knowledge of<pb n="59"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-060"/> the more important facts—and quite dear,
                        especially respecting dates and localities, he conceived he had abundantly
                        done his duty, and recurred to the subject no more.</p>
                    <p>To Millicent Grey it was therefore what it is to three parts of the world, an
                        abstract theory, which had no more to do with the hidden life of her spirit,
                        than those astronomical calculations in which she was often engaged, and a
                        matter as completely external from herself as the code of virtues which she
                        was taught to admire in the heathen philosophers of old. Like the millions
                        who have gone before her and the millions who will come after, she treated
                        it usa manual of useful knowledge not likely to be immediately in
                        requisition, and therefore to be laid aside with much respect till such time
                        as she should reach the Gate of the Tomb, when it would serve as a passport
                        to that other life in which she duly believed, and of which she never
                        thought. It is not <emph>natural</emph> to the young heart to look beyond
                        this present world, this palpable, visible<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7183-061"/>
                        reality, with its manifold attractions, because no bitter experience has
                        ever taught them that it can never, with all its bright things, fill their
                        own immensity of longing. The cloudless eyes for whom no tears of
                        disappointment have dimmed the brightness of this mortal home, turn not
                        easily from the fair, ideal future in which they hope on earth.</p>
                    <p>Youth has a faith and a worship of its own; the worship is the adoration of
                        happiness, and they imagine this god of their idolatry to be enthroned among
                        the sunny bowers of this world, which is so beautiful, so sorrowful, (but
                        beautiful only to their trusting innocence,) little dreaming that a mild,
                        pure angel, distant as angels are, it wanders even now in far greener
                        pastures. The faith is in life, this mortal life in which they believe as
                        containing the sure promise of all the joy which their imagination pictures,
                        and for which their living spirit craves.</p>
                    <p>It was so with Millicent Grey; there was a restlessness in that fresh untamed
                        nature, a questioning in that warm, loving heart, a<pb n="61"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-062"/> stumbling even in the spring time of her days at
                        the mystery of life, but she sought its solution only in the narrow compass
                        of the visible; it never occurred to her that one mystery might unlock the
                        other, and the problem of death solve that of life.</p>
                    <p>And so the bright‐eyed, sunny‐hearted girl stole up to the old, way‐worn man
                        and stood looking at him. John Forde was still the same weary traveler into
                        the unattainable regions of the past, the same hapless dweller in a land of
                        shadows; day by day and night by night had only witnessed the deepening
                        madness of his soul.</p>
                    <p>One would have thought that when his idol crumbled into dust he would have
                        ceased to worship it, but it was not so. When the news of her death first
                        reached him, he was stunned and bewildered, like a man stricken with sudden
                        blindness. Her ideal presence, in which he had so long dwelt, had been to
                        him all in all; he had learnt to concentrate therein every joy of which the
                        various faculties of the heart are<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7183-063"/> capable.
                        Now, in his visions, she was the embodiment of hope to him; now hope
                        realized; now sympathy, when in fancy he told her all he had suffered and
                        she wept for and with him; now happiness, full and complete, when he saw her
                        stealing towards him with the sweet promise on her lips that she would never
                        leave him more! and when he heard that she was gone from earth, all this
                        seemed to have past away with her—he suddenly found himself alone as in a
                        desert where no light was, a rayless, silent waste.</p>
                    <p>The spirit cannot rest on vacancy, and this mental solitude was unendurable;
                        he knew not where to turn for relief; shut out from that enchanted land
                        where he had taught his soul to dwell more fondly than it would have done
                        perhaps in joys that were real, he seemed lost in some dark immensity. For
                        days and nights he wandered about like one beside himself, seeming as though
                        his wild, staring eyes were ever in search of some lost treasure. At length
                        utterly exhausted with the very bewilderment of his sorrow,<pb n="63"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-064"/> he laid himself down on the floor and slept; in
                        that sleep he dreamt one night, and dreamt of her. She came to him radiant
                        and blooming as though no death hue were on the cheek of the shrouded corpse
                        whose representative she was; again her smile lit up the boundless world of
                        his fancy, and life became once more a glad possession!</p>
                    <p>And when he awoke from this sweet vision, he could not bear to part from it.
                        He buried his face in his hands and went on dreaming, and soon he found that
                        for his strange, ideal life, it mattered little whether the image, which was
                        the sun in that world of his creation, were the phantom likeness of one
                        living and absent, or of a cold and coffined corpse. Where all was most
                        unreal, the actual truth could have no influence, and his imagination could
                        lift her out of her dark grave, rigid and helpless as she was, and deck her
                        mouldering form in hues of youth and health, filling her marble hands with
                        the flowers she was wont to love, as easily as once it drew her from her
                        husband’s side<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7183-065"/> and from the cradle of her
                        child, to pass before his eyes a playful, merry girl.</p>
                    <p>From that hour he relapsed into his former visionary state, and the excess of
                        this mental enjoyment seems to have deadened his other faculties completely.
                        He lived as though he were a stranger among men, having no share in the
                        common existence. He was ever listening so intently to the sweet voice
                        murmuring deep within his soul, that most often he heard naught of what was
                        passing round him; and the one image on which his longing eyes were ever
                        fixed, shut out from his sight all things more palpable and real.</p>
                    <p>Millicent had stood by his side sometime quite unobserved, gazing at him with
                        her bright, restless eyes. Of all the problems which life seemed to offer
                        for her great bewilderment, none was so completely inexplicable to her as
                        the existence of John Forde. The knitting of stockings did give a certain
                        interest to Nanette’s life, but her strange, old uncle had not even the
                        excitement of<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7183-066"/> dropping a stitch
                        occasionally. There seemed nothing in the whole world for which he wished to
                        live, and yet he took just as much trouble to preserve existence, by due
                        supplies of nourishment, as others did. Some one great thought certainly
                        occupied him entirely, and she had a vague conviction, in her own mind, that
                        if she could discover it she would gain some insight into that secret use of
                        life which was as yet such a mystery to her. She sat down at his feet and
                        taking his listless hand, looked up into his face.</p>
                    <p>“Dear uncle, please to wake up: I want to speak to you.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent was somewhat of a spoilt child. John Forde had never dreamt of
                        controlling her, and Nanette had but one wish in the world, which was to see
                        her look happy. The good little woman would have put herself to the
                        extremest torture rather than have darkened, in any way, the smile upon the
                        sunny face she loved so well. Fortunately,<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7183-067"/>
                        however, Millicent’s generous disposition and most unselfish, loving heart,
                        had saved her from many of the evils such indulgence is apt to produce. John
                        turned at the sound of her voice, and was going to ask her what she wanted,
                        but as he looked on her face, he began, dreamily, to trace out the likeness
                        between herself and her dead mother, and soon forgot all else. She pressed
                        his hand somewhat impatiently.</p>
                    <p>“Would you try to hear me only for one moment? There is something I want so
                        very much to know, and I have no one but yourself to ask, or indeed I would
                        not trouble you.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent was really in earnest, and there was something plaintive in the
                        tone of her voice which stung him with a sort of remorse. He roused himself
                        at once.</p>
                    <p>“My dear child, tell me all you would say. You are not unhappy, Millicent;
                        surely, surely you are not unhappy! What should I do, most wretched that I
                        am, if there were any sorrow in your heart? She said<pb n="67"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-068"/> she could not rest if there were evil near
                        you!”</p>
                    <p>“No, no! do not look distressed, dear uncle; how wrong I was to disturb you
                        so. I am not unhappy! I do not well know what sorrow means, only I have been
                        bewildered about many things of late, and you are so wise I am sure you can
                        explain them all. I will tell you how it is. I am passing out of childhood
                        now, and I feel that the days are flitting on without my having found out
                        for what purpose they are given me. Until now I have been happy whenever the
                        day was bright and the sunbeams sparkling, when the birds were merry and the
                        flowers blooming; and only sad and weary when the rain came down and crushed
                        my poor, sweet blossoms to the ground, and sent the nightingales all
                        fluttering to their nests. But now I feel somehow that there must be another
                        sunshine for our lives than only the sunshine of the sky; my mind is
                        restless, and I know not why. I have a wish, a longing, and I cannot tell
                            <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7183-069"/> for what; I feel convinced that there
                        is some great good, some happiness in life which must be the reason of our
                        living; and each morning I think—perhaps I shall know of it to‐day, and when
                        I go to sleep at night, I think—will it not come to me to‐morrow? Now tell
                        me what it is.”</p>
                    <p>“Alas, my child,” said John, as he stroked her waving hair, “and can it be
                        that already you are seeking that which men chase from the cradle to the
                        grave, that unattainable—the spirit’s rest!”</p>
                    <p>“The spirit’s rest!” said Millicent, while a sort of fear crept over her, she
                        knew not why. “Uncle, what is that?”</p>
                    <p>“It is the good which all are seeking, and I know not if any find. I can but
                        tell, I sought and found it not, long ago, Millicent, when all my thoughts
                        were not devoured by one thought, and all my mind was not absorbed by one
                        idea. I could have told you of the various shapes in which this desire of
                        all hearts appears to human eyes, and how men struggle panting after it,<pb
                            n="69" xml:id="VAB7183-070"/> many fainting by the way; but now mine own
                        eyes, looking ever inward on the great darkness that is on my soul, have
                        grown as it were blind to all other sights; and I can only tell you what a
                        shipwreck I have made, who freighted all my life upon one hope.”</p>
                    <p>“And where did you seek it, then?” said Millicent, with a trembling
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>“In her love!” he answered, almost fiercely. He gazed for a moment fixedly
                        into vacancy, then, pushing her from him, buried his face in his hands.</p>
                    <p>“Child, child, why have you come to awaken me out of that enchantment, the
                        very surpassing sweetness of whose delusion makes the knowledge of its
                        falsity so bitter? Why have you come to remind me that it was a shipwreck
                        truly, and that the ocean of vain delights on which I seek to keep that
                        shattered bark afloat does hide indeed most hideous depths, where I must
                        sink and be engulfed one day. Go—what can I do for you? If the universal
                        restlessness has<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7183-071"/> fastened on your heart
                        already, I cannot save you from its fruits. They may not be poisonous for
                        you—I cannot tell. You must abide your destiny. You will soon go out into
                        the world, and your unpractised eyes will not so readily perhaps pierce the
                        mask of outward calm which instinct teaches men to wear. It will seem to you
                        that life is a gay and tranquil thing for many, when you see them dwell at
                        ease in happy homes, but, trust my words, their spirit resteth not: wearily,
                        wearily, to and fro, it wandereth, seeking repose. Soon yours will go
                        roaming sadly with the others; it may be for weal or woe. I cannot guide or
                        help you. I can but counsel you out of the bitter knowledge of my own
                        experience: take heed how you make your rest on the hard rock of a human
                        heart.” He laid back his head and wept in silence, for he had grown
                        well‐nigh childish, through long‐indulgence of his feelings.</p>
                    <p>Millicent dared not further trouble him; she crept away far more thoughtful
                            than<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7183-072"/> befitted sixteen summers. He had
                        done a cruel thing in flinging that fear into her mind; yet it seemed to her
                        that she had gained the knowledge of one great fact from this strange
                        conversation with her incomprehensible guardian.</p>
                    <p>She had gathered from it this conviction, that the repose in which her whole
                        being was to rest, and be as it were absorbed, the mysterious repose for
                        which her spirit craved with a longing that deepened every day, was to be
                        found in <emph>human love</emph>. It was natural that she should come to
                        this conclusion, as it must necessarily seem to her that there could be no
                        greater good than that for which John Forde mourned with the mourning of his
                        whole existence.</p>
                    <p>Thus Millicent Grey prepared to begin life with one great mistake.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                    <p><hi>SOME</hi> three years later a letter arrived one morning at the house Rue
                        St. Michel, in the bonne ville d’Aix, where Millicent Grey had dwelt for so
                        long a period. It was one of no small importance to her, for it announced
                        the death of her father, and further contained the request, or rather the
                        commands, of Mrs. Egerton that she should forthwith repair under suitable
                        escort to England, there to take up her abode in the family of her aunt,
                        according to the request of her dying mother.</p>
                    <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7183-074"/>
                    <p>There was now, however, an additional reason for such an arrangement, as Mr.
                        Egerton had by this event become her lawful guardian, which John Forde was
                        not. Mr. Grey, remembering on his deathbed the child on whom he had bestowed
                        no thought in life, had sent for his brother‐in‐law, and entreated him to
                        repair somewhat of his own neglect towards his daughter by undertaking the
                        care of her and her fortune, at least until she should be of age. Mr.
                        Egerton therefore added a few lines to his wife’s letter, to say that she
                        would be expected as soon as possible at Rookcliffe, his country residence
                        in ——shire.</p>
                    <p>In compliance with these instructions Millicent Grey found herself, on a fine
                        evening in the month of May, after a rapid journey through France, on board
                        of the steamer which was to convey her from Hâvre to London.</p>
                    <p>John Forde was not with her—he could not have accompanied her to her
                            uncle’s<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7183-075"/> house, and his task was, in
                        fact, completely over—he had fulfilled his promise—he need fear no mournful
                        reproaching gaze from the eyes that were ever looking at him out of that
                        grave—neither the dead nor the living Millicent would claim more from him
                        than he had done; and he was well pleased that now that young, ardent life
                        should be separated from his own apathetical and cold existence. He felt
                        little affection for her, most lovable as she certainly was, so warm‐hearted
                        and full of noble generous feeling, but he could spare no love from the
                        buried mother for the blooming daughter, and his mind had become so
                        completely enervated by his long indulgence that he was incapable of the
                        smallest exertion. Human sounds grated powerfully on his ear, human sights
                        were hateful to him, he desired an entire solitude, and such he knew he
                        should have at Aix, when Millicent left him. He roused himself to wish her
                        well through a world where he himself had been taken in a snare so perilous,
                        and then<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7183-076"/> turned away to think of her and of
                        all other living forms no more.</p>
                    <p>Millicent herself wept much at parting with him. She kissed his unresisting
                        hands again and again, and almost felt as if the delight of going at last to
                        visit this wonderful world, of which she had dreamt so long, were sadly
                        lessened by the separation from her childhood’s guardian.</p>
                    <p>Yet Nanette remarked, somewhat maliciously, that her tears flowed quite as
                        freely when they passed the grande statue in the Plâce on their way out of
                        the town. In fact, at Millicent’s age, and with her loving disposition, it
                        was impossible for her not to attach herself to the only person with whom
                        she had shared her home besides her bonne,—but it could not possibly be a
                        deep‐rooted affection, or a lasting regret; for John Forde had been nothing
                        in her existence, monotonous as it was. After the first natural pang of
                        separation was over it could make little difference that her eyes no longer
                        turned occasionally on<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7183-077"/> the dull motionless
                        figure of her silent guardian.</p>
                    <p>As for Nanette, despite her feeling of extreme mental helplessness after she
                        quitted Père André,—despite her dread of English heretics and coal fires,
                        and her invincible horror for some creature of her imagination which she was
                        wont to denominate <foreign xml:lang="fre">bif staiks</foreign>, she would
                        as soon have thought of changing her faith as of quitting her well‐beloved
                        charge. Her warm attachment was fully reciprocated by Millicent, and it was
                        really a touching thing to see those two, so different in age and station
                        and in every circumstance of life, yet linked so closely by this tender
                        friendship. So they stood together on board of the London packet as it
                        smoked and panted preparatory to starting from the shores of France. As
                        usual, humanity in its least fascinating aspect was to be found on deck. It
                        is marvelous how speedily the atmosphere of refinement and polished
                        courtesy, which counterfeits so admirably the virtues men<pb n="77"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-078"/> ought to possess, will evaporate from around a
                        party of individuals, entire strangers to one another, who find themselves
                        huddled together in an uncomfortable steamer, with the prospect of a stormy
                        night. Nowhere, perhaps, does human nature appear with so little disguise.
                        There is no occasion here for the universal and never‐failing politeness,
                        which is so apt a representation of a pure and generous unselfishness; every
                        one feels at liberty to occupy themselves solely with the real object of
                        their solicitude, and one by one they are seen to ensconce themselves in
                        their own cloaks and their own sulkiness, each man drawing on his traveling
                        cap in its own peculiar style of hideousness.</p>
                    <p>There was the usual assemblage to‐night. There stands the young Englishman
                        who might have been seen, a few days since, stalking like any heathen
                        through the prostrate groups of kneeling worshippers in St. Peter’s, his
                        spy‐glass in his eye; and his hands in his pockets. At his side yawns<pb
                            n="78" xml:id="VAB7183-079"/> another of our enlightened countrymen, who
                        lately made an excursion to Athens for the purpose of shooting Greek owls; a
                        happy expedient of which he bethought himself when he had exhausted the
                        usual Britannic excitements of shaving his head, dressing like a Turk, and
                        otherwise astonishing the natives, and who in that renowned city having been
                        induced by the earnest entreaties of his valet‐de‐place to visit the
                        Parthenon, looked around him on these ruins of mournful beauty, and taking
                        his cigar from his mouth, listlessly inquired what they called this
                        place.</p>
                    <p>Further on is the brisk young clergyman, who, with his aristocratic pupil,
                        spent two months not long since in the Holy City, and employed the interval
                        in falling in love with, and marrying the daughter of a missionary there
                        established; the sentimental preliminaries having been carried on during an
                        excursion to Bethlehem, and the declaration and acceptance having taken
                        place at the foot of the Mount of Olives, such being the<pb n="79"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-080"/> habits of the clerical pilgrims of modern times.
                        That sharp cross looking man with green spectacles and a huge note‐book
                        under his arm, has been visiting the Syrian monasteries, where he has been
                        treated with the utmost kindness and hospitality, having been nursed through
                        a six weeks’ fever by the good brethren on Mount Carmel. He is now returning
                        to England, where he proposes to enlarge the public mind with a volume of
                        travels, which is to contain a sneering denunciation of the monkish
                        superstition of his late venerable hosts; and further, such an account of
                        their theory and practice as a total ignorance of all languages save his
                        native guttural, and a fund of deeply toothed prejudice, shall enable him to
                        produce.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of these various indviduals it was a pleasant sight to see young
                        Millicent Grey, as she stood at the side of the vessel, looking over the
                        foaming water towards the yet unseen shores of England, braving, with
                        child‐like pleasure, the rough visiting of the<pb n="80"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-081"/> fresh breeze that blew upon her bright face,
                        whilst her sparkling eye and glowing cheek told how high her heart was
                        beating with its ardent hope, and with what energy and vigour she was
                        preparing for the life‐struggle to which she was now advancing fast. She was
                        at this time somewhere between nineteen and twenty years of age, and
                        notwithstanding that she had great depth and intensity of feeling, as well
                        as a shrewd penetrating mind, she was still guileless and simple as when we
                        saw her listening to the mournful words, never afterwards forgotten, of poor
                        John Forde.</p>
                    <p>No one was prepared to enter on the world with less idea of the consequences
                        than Millicent Grey; in fact, her peculiar education had been of a nature to
                        render her well nigh incapable of understanding the whole artificial
                        frame‐work of society. She was essentially truthful,—it never occurred to
                        her to speak otherwise than she thought, although her due share of womanly
                        timidity and reserve prevented her from<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7183-082"/>
                        communicating much of what she felt; and above all, she was accustomed to
                        see things exactly as they were, without being in any degree influenced by
                        popular fallacies or received opinion. She was joyous and lighthearted now,
                        as those are only who have not tried their strength in the sore strife and
                        conflicts that await them,—yet haply none would exchange the tempered
                        gladness which falls on all, who have seen their guardian hope make itself
                        wings and fly up into heaven, for that first sparkling buoyancy which hath
                        no abiding charm: the one is like the dazzling lustre of the sunbeams, that
                        fades before the clouds, the other, less brilliant but more pure, is like
                        the sweet, tranquil light of the stars on a clear cold night.</p>
                    <p>She stood, casting her free glance over the sea, and already in imagination
                        her bounding feet were treading the golden plains of her ideal
                        future,—strange! if any one had suddenly mapped out before her eyes then,
                        what that future was to be. Ah!<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7183-083"/> who, in the
                        dawn of life, could look on such a sight and not turn sickening from it? Who
                        that could foresee the process of their discipline would have the heart to
                        turn and live? When the actual trial comes the strength comes with it to
                        endure; when the piercing wound is made then flows the healing balm; and
                        when the earth flowers fade, that lure us from the homeward path, how
                        sweetly spring to life the blossoms of celestial bloom, whose fragrance
                        penetrates the soul with soothing power, so that backward looking, when the
                        journey’s ended, we can see how each sharp arrow has been winged by love.
                        But in that hour of hope and bright expectancy, had it been given to
                        Millicent Grey to look upon her future years, she had found it hard to
                        resist the temptation of plunging with one bound into those boiling waters
                        to hide herself within their breast from the wilder tempests and the colder
                        blasts that soon would meet her in her life’s career.</p>
                    <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7183-084"/>
                    <p>She was not long allowed to stand indulging in her brilliant fancies; the
                        bustle of starting was just over, and the steamer fairly under way, when
                        Nanette came rushing up to her in a state of great excitement
                        exclaiming,—</p>
                    <p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Ma chérie</foreign>, we must be coming near to
                        England now, for there is a <foreign xml:lang="fre">gros Anglais</foreign>
                        come on board, and he is making inquiries for roast beef.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said Millicent, “We shall be there to‐morrow. Oh, Nanette!” she added,
                        turning round her beaming face, “life <emph>is</emph> going to begin
                        now.”</p>
                    <p>“My dear young lady, I sincerely hope you may not be heartily tired of it
                        before it is done,” said a strange voice at her side. She looked round
                        hastily, and found that the speaker was an old gentleman, supported on
                        crutches, who had been watching her animated looks with much interest for
                        some time past. He raised his hat courteously as her eyes met his.</p>
                    <p>“I really beg your pardon,” he said, <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7183-085"/> “for
                        having taken the liberty of addressing you. It was quite involuntary, I
                        assure you, but I was struck by your remark, which contrasted so vividly
                        with my own state of feeling.”</p>
                    <p>He was an aristocratic looking old man, who had once been handsome, but he
                        was entirely crippled by palsy; his countenance, which was by no means
                        unpleasing, had an expression of great firmness, accompanied by a slight
                        degree of irritability; he looked as if he were thoroughly accustomed to
                        have his own way in all things, and his long‐protracted state of suffering
                        had no doubt rendered him somewhat capricious in his desires. On the whole,
                        however, he looked thoroughly estimable and benevolent, and for the moment
                        seemed very anxious that Millicent should not take offence at his
                        unceremonious speech.</p>
                    <p>She hastened to assure him that such was not the case, and feeling convinced,
                        by the sort of freemasonry which exists in a certain class of society, that
                        he was a<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7183-086"/> person with whom she might very
                        safely associate, she readily entered into conversation with him. They sat
                        down amicably together, and although of course, being such entire strangers,
                        they could only talk on indifferent topics, yet the old man was soon
                        altogether charmed with Millicent,—there was such a freshness and simplicity
                        in her impressions of England, the new country she was going to explore, and
                        at the same time so much depth in her observations, whilst her frank manner
                        and ready smile were of themselves really very captivating.</p>
                    <p>“Why, you talk of visiting England and its natives as if you were going to
                        inquire into the manners and customs of the Chinese,” said the old man, at
                        last, smiling at her animation.</p>
                    <p>“Well, it is pretty much like visiting China or Kamschatka, or any other
                        foreign country, to me. I have never been there since I was quite a little
                        child; of course it is my native land, and I am quite ready to<pb n="86"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-087"/> love it very much beforehand, but at the same
                        time I am rather curious to see it, because I expect it will explain to me a
                        great many things which I don’t understand in the world. There is an immense
                        deal of good sense in England, is there not?”</p>
                    <p>“Why, I believe there is upon the whole; and yet people do foolish things
                        enough there. I could tell you of a few,” he added, shrugging his shoulders
                        with a comical smile.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, I should not like it if they did not,” said Millicent; “but what I
                        expect will prove so instructive to me is, that I am told the English all
                        live upon system. In France, you know, they live <foreign xml:lang="fre"
                            >pour passer le temps</foreign>; and in Italy, I believe, their
                        existence is one of impulse; but in England, I hear, they all think very
                        seriously, and make up their minds what they ought to do, and do it. I
                        believe there is system in everything—great systems for legislation,
                        national education, and so on—and little private systems for the life of
                        each person. Is it so?”</p>
                    <pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7183-088"/>
                    <p>“ Well, I declare I can scarcely tell. Like M. Jourdain, who was not aware he
                        had been talking <foreign xml:lang="fre">de la prose</foreign>, I hardly
                        know whether I have been living on system or not; and yet now I think of it,
                        I certainly have; and, what is more, I can tell you very distinctly the
                        nature of it. My system undoubtedly is, to make myself as comfortable as I
                        possibly can, at all times and in all places. With these withered limbs of
                        mine it is not very easy; and yet, by the help of a good cook and pleasant
                        society, I manage pretty well. Yes, that is clearly my principle. I must
                        thank you for making it known to me.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, the system of making one’s self comfortable is very common in England, I
                        believe,” said Millicent, musingly; “but now, pray excuse me for asking it,
                        I should like so much to know why you thought I should tire of life before
                        it was done.”</p>
                    <p>“Simply because I am very tired of it myself,” said the old gentleman,
                        laughing; “not that I want to be rid of it however,<pb n="88"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-089"/> oh dear, no!” and he looked round with a sort of
                        terror, as if he was afraid some one would take him at his word, and relieve
                        him of what was clearly a beloved burden; “But the truth is, that in early
                        life I made one very great mistake, and I have suffered for it ever
                        since.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent gave a timid glance of inquiry, but he shook his head, smiling.</p>
                    <p>“No, really I dare not, on so short an acquaintance, make you acquainted with
                        all the secrets of my history. Should we meet again, as I trust, or rather,
                        to tell you the truth, as I am determined we shall, I have no doubt I should
                        be inclined to make you wise by my past experience.” </p>
                    <p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Ma chérie</foreign>,” put in Nanette, at this
                        juncture, who saw that Millicent was gaining some information from her new
                        friend, “Ask Monsieur if that is the way in which Englishmen amuse
                        themselves?” She pointed to where two of the passengers were engaged over a
                        game at chess. “I heard them say, let us amuse ourselves;<pb n="89"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-090"/> but if that is their amusement, <foreign
                            xml:lang="fre">ma foi! c’est que c’est bien lugubre</foreign>; they have
                        not spoken one word, or smiled one smile, since they began, but they have
                        shaken their heads, and nodded to one another with, oh, such a
                        solemnity!”</p>
                    <p>Millicent and her new friend laughed heartily at Nanette’s look of horror,
                        who clearly thought that the most serious of affairs in France was merrier
                        than amusements in England. They continued to converse together with much
                        satisfaction, till the arrival of a tall servant, laden with cloaks and
                        plaids, interrupted them. He ventured to hint, that the night air was
                        dangerous to his master, and the old gentleman was obliged to confess it was
                        somewhat imprudent in him to remain so late on deck. He therefore took leave
                        of Millicent with all the courtier‐like politeness of former days, and
                        having been duly wrapped up in various mufflings, allowed himself to be
                        carried off like a stout bundle, by the powerful footman.</p>
                    <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7183-091"/>
                    <p>We all know how speedily acquaintances are made in travelling; the frigid
                        barriers which society raises between man and man are so completely thrown
                        down when all are alike exposed to the same inconveniences, and it may be
                        dangers. Who has not known what it is to swear an eternal friendship to the
                        charming individual whose society has enlivened a ten days’ voyage in a
                        wretched steamer, or to feel as unhappy as though one had lost one’s nearest
                        relations, when the termination of a fortnight’s quarantine separates us
                        from the family who shared its miseries with us? Millicent and the old
                        gentleman met next morning as though they had been acquainted for years, and
                        cordially shook hands with mutual pleasure.</p>
                    <p>They had a bad passage, and did not arrive at their destination until several
                        hours beyond the usual time, There was considerable confusion on board, and
                        the tall servant was fully occupied in taking charge of numerous packages
                        belonging to<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7183-092"/> his master, in the course of
                        which proceedings he tumbled several times over the active little Nanette,
                        who invariably begged his pardon, and hoped, in an audible whisper, that all
                        Englishmen were not to be so tall and so stiff. It thus happened that the
                        poor old gentleman, whose infirmity rendered him quite helpless, would have
                        been wholly without the attendance of which he stood so much in need, had
                        not Millicent taken on herself the task of ministering to his comforts. She
                        brought him his breakfast, put on his cloak, and ran after his hat, when the
                        wind blew it away; in short, she made herself not only so useful, but so
                        agreeable to him, that he looked as if he could not bear to part with her
                        when the moment of separation came. He detained her for some time, when she
                        rose to take leave of him previous to landing, and seemed uncertain whether
                        he might venture to say what he wished. At last, summoning courage, he
                        said,—</p>
                    <p>“I have a great favour to ask, and I<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7183-093"/> must
                        beg you to excuse me if it seems an impertinent request. I trust my motive,
                        which you shall most certainly know hereafter, will quite exonerate me. Will
                        you tell me your destination in England? In short, will you give me your
                        address at your new abode?”</p>
                    <p>Millicent was too completely ignorant of the ways of the world to imagine
                        that there could be any reason to prevent her doing as he wished, especially
                        as Nanette, whose bright imagination had already conjured up visions of
                        splendid <foreign xml:lang="fre">cadeaux</foreign> which this dear, sensible
                        old <emph>milord</emph> was to bestow on her darling, was inciting her, by
                        many significant looks and signs, to tell him immediately. Millicent,
                        therefore, gave him her address at Mr. Egerton’s, and so took her leave of
                        him, never recollecting till she had left the steamer, that she herself had
                        failed to obtain any information as to the name or position of her newly
                        acquired friend.</p>

                    <p><hi>ROOKCLIFFE</hi>, the future abode of Millicent Grey, lay at a distance of
                        some five miles from the nearest railway station, and it was late in the
                        evening before she found herself in the carriage which her uncle had sent to
                        convey her over the intervening space. Nanette, quite fatigued with the
                        number of reverences she had made, with most unappreciated politeness, to
                        the stoical gentlemen in glazed hats who had handed her out and in of the
                        railway carriages, composed herself to sleep in a<pb n="94"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-095"/> corner, whilst Millicent, leaning eagerly towards
                        the window, gazed out into the darkness, and tried to distinguish the
                        different objects on which the light of the lamps flashed rapidly as they
                        whiffed along.</p>
                    <p>She felt, as she had done throughout this journey, that she was being carried
                        on to her destiny, that she was traveling, as it were, over the first stage
                        of life, and there was a feeling almost of rapture in the excitement which
                        thrilled every nerve, as she thought of the unknown future to which she
                        looked with such anxiety. She little knew how, somewhat later, with most
                        ineffable calm, we learn to lay ourselves down on the breast of that dark
                        stream, and, with hands all humbly crossed upon the bosom, scarred with many
                        a half‐closed wound, let the quick current bear us on and on, without an
                        effort to direct its course, thinking only how deep, and clear, and smooth
                        is the boundless ocean, to whose placid rest it bears us rapidly. Even
                            the<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7183-096"/> locality of her future abode was
                        full of interest to Millicent, and she experienced an almost child‐like
                        pleasure in tracing the indistinct features of the landscape through which
                        she was passing.</p>
                    <p>There is at all times a strange sensation in traveling by night through a
                        peopled country; the contrast is so great between the lucid sky, where alone
                        the remains of light are gathered, and the dark heavy earth, seeming to lie
                        in sullen silence beneath its pail of shadows. The sight of those huge
                        masses of building, whence no sound arises, but which we know to be so
                        teeming with life, sentient, suffering, and mysterious, fills us with a
                        sense of awe and, we fain with our dim eyes would pierce the outward matter
                        to discern what manner of spirit is within.</p>
                    <p>How awful were a voice to come forth from each one of these dark piles of
                        habitation, and proclaim the hidden truth of the living mysteries within,
                        saying, “Here human love is agonizing; there<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7183-097"
                        /> infamy and vice walk rampant; here despair is writhing in the dust; there
                        cankering want hath torn affection even from a mother’s heart, and the child
                        that asked not life from her is praying for its passing.”</p>
                    <p>But no such voice is heard, at least, except we question it; and so, through
                        scenes which, could we witness them, would make us turn away heart‐sick to
                        weep as it were tears of blood for our hapless brethren, we pass,—dreaming
                        golden dreams, as Millicent did now!</p>
                    <p>The first mile or two carried her through a colliery district, and even in
                        the dim light she could discern the miserable appearance of the miners’
                        habitations, which were in fact but a set of wretched hovels crowded
                        together; their numbers were, however, so great that she rightly estimated
                        the population as being very considerable. A bleak common of no great extent
                        divided this uninviting part of the county from a tract of land where the
                        scenery was of a totally opposite<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7183-098"/>
                        character. Though still flat it was richly wooded, and beautifully
                        undulating; in bright daylight it presented that fair, peaceful aspect so
                        peculiar to the English landscape and to which the heart of the traveller
                        returns with such a longing fondness amid all the magnificence of other
                        climes. Not gorgeous Eastern skies, or Alpine mountains in their savage
                        splendour, can ever be as lovely or as dear as the waving woods of England,
                        so bright in their green luxuriance, with those quiet fields whose golden
                        corn seems to have robbed the sunshine, and the voices wildly musical of
                        rushing stream and sighing wind.</p>
                    <p>Even by night Millicent could distinguish some of the beauty of this scene,
                        as the tall trees seemed to sweep past her, assuming a thousand fantastic
                        shapes, and often obscuring the sky altogether with their thick branches.
                        One object, however, before entering the wood, attracted her attention
                        forcibly; it was a small church,<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7183-099"/> situated
                        on the borders of the common nearest the mines, in a very dreary and
                        desolate position, and which to her astonishment was lighted up even at that
                        hour. She was the more surprised as, on approaching the village adjoining
                        Rookcliffe, she passed another, of far more imposing appearance, which was
                        entirely in darkness. Very picturesque this village seemed to be; very
                        captivating the pictures of homely, peaceful life, revealed through the half
                        open cottage doors, whence the fire‐light streamed out upon the dark
                        road.</p>
                    <p>This village being Mr. Egerton’s own property, and all these simple
                        villagers, peering from their lattice windows as the travellers pass, being
                        also Mr. Egerton’s dependents, the coachman, sympathizing with that
                        gentleman’s feelings, now causes the well appointed carriage to take a
                        somewhat more aristocratic pace, and whirls it with noisy ostentation to the
                        gate. The woman at the lodge is all ready to give it free entrance, and she
                        curtsies in the<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7183-100"/> dark with due respect to
                        the wheels, which grind past her feet with so close a shave that she is not
                        very sure for ten minutes afterwards whether she has them all safe, On it
                        sweeps down the long avenue; and a sudden feeling of timidity and of terror,
                        she knows not for what, strikes Millicent Grey as she catches a glimpse of
                        the stately house, that rises up massive and gloomy before her. She grasps
                        Nanette’s little warm hand, and in another moment the carriage sweeps with
                        an artistic flourish to the portico, and she finds herself at Rookcliffe.
                        The door stood hospitably open to receive her, and on the threshold, in the
                        centre of the blaze of light which streamed from the hall, Mr. Egerton was
                        placed ready to welcome her to his house.</p>
                    <p>It was happy and striking coincidence, if this estimable individual was
                        unaware of the pleasing picture which he presented in his benevolent
                        attitude on the threshold, with his opaque person coming out darkly against
                        the back‐ground of glowing light,<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7183-101"/> and the
                        doorway forming a suitable framework around him.</p>
                    <p>He was a perfect type of the English country gentleman. There was such bland
                        respectability teeming from his large glowing countenance, which seemed as
                        though it were always reflecting the light of the fire after dinner, and
                        such warmth and comfort diffused over the whole outer man, whilst his
                        expression and general appearance gave ample evidence of the entire
                        self‐approbation and complacency which reigned within. He welcomed Millicent
                        with precisely the proper amount of cordiality, and folded her in an embrace
                        systematically paternal; then releasing her, he offered his hand with that
                        hospitable flourish peculiar to individuals in his position, and with a
                        cheerful countenance, which seemed to say—“Behold with what self‐forgetting
                        generosity I admit my friends to the bosom of my family!”—he conducted her
                        towards Mrs. Egerton, who advanced from the drawing‐room to meet her.</p>
                    <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7183-102"/>
                    <p>This lady was the personification of dignified propriety, and of composed,
                        resolute acceptance of all the advantages and privileges, physical and
                        moral, which were to be derived from her station in society. Stately
                        looking, well dressed, never varying one hair’s breadth from the routine of
                        life, easy and luxurious, which is the settled system of existence for
                        persons of her fortune and position, everything in her house, her person,
                        her manners, and her religion, were arranged to meet the approving eye of
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>Whether she were the urbane hostess, the careful mother, the
                        mildly‐reproving, silently‐determined wife, or the benevolent dispenser of
                        soup and blankets at Christmas‐tide, (these benefits being transmitted to
                        her awe‐struck tenantry through the hands of a housekeeper in black satin
                        and pink ribbons, who wore kid gloves in case she should accidentally touch
                        any of the recipients of her bounty,) Mrs. Egerton still acted up to the one
                        principle which guided her in all things,<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7183-103"/>
                        of making a faultless appearance in the sight of her fellow men, and obeying
                        to the very letter all the requirements of established custom, according to
                        her rank and circumstances. If there were any one quality peculiarly
                        prominent in Mrs. Egerton’s character, it was what is commonly called
                        “proper pride,” that mysterious virtue belonging we know not to what faith
                        or to what tenets, which is held in such esteem by those who not the less,
                        through some subtle calculation of their own accommodating mind, firmly
                        expect that inheritance of the meek which is promised in the doctrines they
                        profess.</p>
                    <p>Millicent received another measured English embrace from this stiff but
                        comfortable looking representative of good feeling, dignity, and
                        respectability, who was further remarkable for a serenity of aspect peculiar
                        to herself, and which emanated, no doubt, from the pleasant conviction that
                        every thing she had ever done, said, or thought, was exactly as it ought to
                        have been. She was then ushered into the drawing‐room,<pb n="103"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-104"/> having just caught a glimpse of poor Nanette,
                        hurried off, with despairing looks, by three or four gigantic footmen, to
                        the care of a housekeeper, awful in satins and stateliness, who appeared
                        dimly in the far perspective. The drawing‐room seemed to Millicent blazing
                        with light and full of people. She clung involuntarily to her uncle’s arm,
                        and stood looking round from under the masses of her long brown hair, with
                        the shy, timid glance of a startled deer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Egerton presented her in due form to the various members of his family;
                        three daughters, Anne, Fanny, and Sophia; two sons, Charles and Arthur.</p>
                    <p>Anne, tall and frigid, looking by no means so young as she could have wished;
                        unpleasantly handsome, having bold features and hawk’s eyes, haughty and
                        supercilious in manner, as though she had discovered some excellent reason
                        why she was to consider herself superior to every one around her, and that,
                        duly pious and Christianized<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7183-105"/> as she was,
                        she had received a special license for giving pain to others by coldness and
                        contempt. This young lady was wont to delight herself solely in matters
                        altogether beyond a woman’s province, for she talked politics and philosophy
                        with an assurance which had its desired effect on the majority of her
                        acquaintances. We may further add, that Miss Anne Egerton also fully
                        expected to reap the reward of all the virtues, such as humility,
                        gentleness, and self‐denial, inculcated by the creed she professed with much
                        Sunday ostentation.</p>
                    <p>Fanny, with indistinct hair and indefinite features, a small mind and a small
                        voice, loving to sing small songs and to entrap unwary individuals into
                        swearing an eternal friendship; all nerves and sensibility, continually
                        declaring she must have sympathy; that she could not exist without it; that
                        she was entirely dependent on her friends for happiness, and therefore,
                        though she was sorry to be troublesome to them, yet really, constituted as
                        she was, she must entreat of<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7183-106"/> them to
                        sacrifice themselves to her; she must really claim all their time and
                        attention; whatever their avocations might be, they could never be so
                        important as the necessity that she, in her highly‐wrought state of mind,
                        should have some one to whom she could tell her feelings:—Fanny fell into
                        the common snare of imagining that she established a legitimate excuse for
                        her caprice, self‐indulgence, and thorough egotism, (qualified, of course,
                        by far daintier names,) when she affirmed that they were inherent to her
                        nature, and therefore indispensable evils, not to be resisted.</p>
                    <p>Sophia, decidedly plain, short, thick‐set, and able‐bodied, having a worthy
                        look, which was a species of moral livery to the peculiar line she had
                        chosen; for this young lady had discovered that her especial vocation was
                        the improvement of mankind, and to this end she laboured with a noisy zeal,
                        no detail of which was ever allowed to pass unobserved by her numerous
                        acquaintance. She pursued her call‐<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7183-107"/> ing
                        without the slightest references to established principles or authorities;
                        for, as she loved to say, when setting at defiance those before whose grey
                        hairs she should have bowed in reverent silence, she had a thoroughly
                        independent mind, and acted in all cases on theories of her own. Her
                        conversation never was of the most lively description, for as she was fully
                        convinced apparently that no one would be so much acquainted with her own
                        merits as herself, she habitually undertook the task of doing herself
                        justice, and discharged the duty with extraordinary fidelity. She was at all
                        times to be heard quietly detailing her own meritorious acts, never dreaming
                        that any merit they might have possessed was turned to veriest poison by
                        such an open display, and in her daily descent on the village, armed with
                        medicines and tracts, and stocked with severe, overbearing admonitions, she
                        gathered up material for much complacent haranguing at her father’s
                        luxurious table.</p>
                    <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7183-108"/>
                    <p>And thus she took to herself without misgiving the name of Charity;—that holy
                        one, who with veiled face and noiseless steps glides unseen in the shadow of
                        all who suffer;—fearing not, though snow‐white are her garments, to steal
                        into polluted haunts; appearing, as though warned by some tender instinct,
                        wherever tears are falling, or aching hearts are wearying to rest; through
                        long dark nights making a pillow of her gentle arm for the throbbing head,
                        and over many a rough and distant path, speeding with the angel words of
                        pity or of comfort; but ever voiceless, silent, having no name, save in the
                        prayers of the fatherless and widow.</p>
                    <p>Very charitable Sophia was pronounced to be; very estimable she was by all
                        considered, and of late she had established herself as an authoress, by the
                        publication of certain articles on the education of the aged ignorant, and
                        one small volume, entitled “Hints to Bishops,” which, as Rookcliffe was a
                        pleasant house to visit in, obtained some little circulation in the
                        neighbouring.</p>
                    <p>The woman who writes is always in an<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7183-109"/>
                        anomalous position; however powerful the motive which compels her to
                        authorship, she has quitted her own sphere, and has taken to herself a
                        vocation for which she is neither fitted nor intended, for her reasoning
                        powers are weak, her knowledge limited, and her judgment swayed by her
                        feelings; when once she becomes an object of public comment, she loses all
                        claim to the consideration and delicacy due to her very name; but she does
                            <emph>not</emph> lose the modest timidity, the natural reserve, which
                        causes her a bitter pang each time that she is dragged before the public
                        gaze.</p>
                    <p>She has gone beyond her own province, and therefore she must consent to belie
                        her own nature. It would be a mockery to talk of shrinking from observation,
                        when of her own will she has met the rude stare of strange eyes; absurd to
                        say that she trembles to trust her own judgment or to guide her own
                        faltering steps, when she who should have done the bidding of others, has
                        come forth to govern and influence the minds of many. She has<pb n="109"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-110"/> quitted the stronghold of her womanly reserve and
                        privileges, and henceforth she dare not turn, with all the revolting of
                        heart she feels, from the personal remarks, the fulsome flattering, and the
                        impertinent scrutiny, to which she has exposed herself; she has given
                        herself as fair game to be hunted down for the public amusement, and she has
                        no right to complain if the noise and turmoil of the chase fills her with
                        terror, and with a weary longing for the unnoticed retirement which is her
                        rightful sphere.</p>
                    <p>Sophia, however, had a fund of self‐sufficiency, which enabled her to pass
                        through this ordeal with great equanimity; in fact, to sum up her character
                        in a word, she was one of those persons who constrain free‐born Englishmen
                        to wish most heartily that a little of the Turkish discipline were
                        established in their country, and that the ladies, even without yellow
                        slippers and the fear of sacks before their eyes, should be restricted to
                        such spheres of action, and such topics of conversation, as are within<pb
                            n="110" xml:id="VAB7183-111"/> the bounds of their capacity and suitable
                        attainments.</p>
                    <p>Millicent’s bright visions of a loving companionship with her cousins began
                        to melt away very rapidly after she had received Anne’s chilling welcome,
                        accompanied by a scrutinizing look which enveloped her whole person, and
                        subsided into a sneer, and had also been subjected to Sophia’s hard
                        impressive shake of the hand, who already perceived in her a victim for
                        future improvement; whilst Fanny declared that she had been put into such a
                        flutter of spirits by the stranger’s arrival, that she required the
                        attention of all present for some time in order to restore her to
                        composure.</p>
                    <p>But the introductions were not yet over. Mr. Egerton next presented his two
                        sons. Charles, the eldest, was tall, rather good‐looking, and studiously
                        elegant. He was refined, exclusive, and supercilious, and, as a matter of
                        course, always absurd, and often disagreeable. He was one of those men who
                        render life an intolerable burden by<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7183-112"/>
                        maintaining that all the customs and rules of society, down to the most
                        minute of unnecessary “convenances,” must be rigidly obeyed at all times and
                        in all places, His favourite amusements were fishing and shooting, and
                        otherwise endangering the peace and health of many innocent creatures; and
                        he was further much addicted to the pastime of morally dissecting his
                        neighbours, whose faults and follies he would skilfully expose and
                        ingeniously discuss, with an air and manner which seemed to intimate that he
                        did not in any degree partake of the same nature as themselves. Arthur, the
                        last of Millicent’s new relations, was very slow in obeying his father’s
                        summons to come forward and make her acquaintance. He advanced towards her,
                        evidently with no good will, and he bent down his head so much that she
                        could not distinguish his features, though she was struck with his
                        peculiarly ungainly and clumsy figure. Arthur merely gave his hand in
                        silence, and was turning away,<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7183-113"/> when
                        Charles called out to him tauntingly, “Come, Arthur, this will never do;
                        Miss Grey expects to see all her cousins to‐night, and you are leaving her
                        to speculate mysteriously on the probable peculiarities of the countenance
                        you are hiding so assiduously. Perhaps she thinks you are afraid to dazzle
                        her by the brilliancy of your appearance; let me recommend you to prevent
                        her forming too glowing a picture by allowing her to see that expressive
                        face of yours at once.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent saw that the frame of the young man shook, she knew not with what
                        emotion, as his brother spoke, but the next moment he slowly turned his head
                        towards her, and she was startled by seeing a countenance more entirely
                        devoid of all beauty than any she had ever looked upon;—a face so painfully
                        and strikingly plain she could not have imagined, and she no longer wondered
                        that her cousin shrank from observation. It was not possible that his
                        appearance should fail to excite a feeling of<pb n="113"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-114"/> repugnance in the minds of all who saw him; and
                        that he was fully aware of this was plain from the look of hopeless
                        despondency with which he turned away. Millicent was full of generous
                        feeling, and she inwardly determined that she would show him the utmost
                        cordiality and consideration in all her intercourse with him; but in the
                        meantime she had to follow her aunt to the sofa, where she was to spend the
                        remainder of the evening in great state by her side. Here she was provided
                        with some very strong tea, which she felt herself constrained to accept, in
                        case she should distress the fat butler, who had brought it expressly for
                        her; and then commenced a dull, heavy, commonplace conversation, of that
                        aimless, unprofitable species which seems the only legitimate and
                        established occupation for the long hours after dinner, and which always has
                        seemed to us the dreariest waste of time.</p>
                    <p>Most thankful was Millicent when the punctual Mr. Egerton, who never
                            varied<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7183-115"/> half a minute from the
                        appointed hours, announced that it was time to retire. She bade her new
                        friends good night with suspicious alacrity, and the feeling of depression
                        and timidity which hung around her all the evening, was for the first time
                        dissipated, when she found herself clasped in the ready embrace of her dear
                        old <foreign xml:lang="fre">bonne</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>Ah! blessed human sympathy,—gentle, loving, kindly human sympathy,—what a
                        marvelous treasure it is, without which, truly, we were poor indeed. It is a
                        beautiful thing to think that to every living soul is given the power to
                        alleviate suffering by that one heaven‐taught influence! too many ignore
                        their high calling in this respect,—too many forget what a noble power they
                        possess, and that the weakest, the most unworthy, the poorest amongst may
                        be, as a minister of consolation, wearing to the eyes all dim with weeping
                        the form of a very angel. For even if we have only words and looks to give,
                        we must still let the look be one of tenderness and pity,<pb n="115"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-116"/> and the words, of loving kindness; and the aching
                        heart shall throb less madly, the heavy eyes shall turn to the light
                        again.</p>
                    <p>We are so closely knit together in this world, dust so clings to dust, that
                        the lightest token of a fellow creature’s dear compassion is strangely
                        precious to us. Shame on the niggard hearts that seek not to dispense this
                        costly gift, and leave it withering beneath the cold, sullen influence of
                        their indifference or their pride! They know not what an angel they are
                        driving from their side when their selfish carelessness destroys the power
                        of sympathy in their own breasts, for it is the one only joy this earth can
                        give which naught can ever take away. They themselves may be most sad and
                        lonely, the light of love and hope departed from before their eyes, and only
                        that quiet gloom remaining which spreads itself upon this mortal life like
                        some funereal pall, when the desire of earthly happiness is dead. Yet still
                        more blessed far is so to pity and console than to enjoy the fond affection
                            or<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7183-117"/> the care of others, and they may
                        make themselves a sunshine brighter than the sunshine of their youthful
                        hopes, in the returning smiles of those whom they have cheered in sorrow,
                        whilst in their sinking hearts the tears of gratitude shall fall more sweet
                        than dew, refreshing flowers that droop at even.</p>
                    <p>Let us not mistrust our gift, however weak we feel ourselves to be; there
                        never yet walked one on earth whose path was not darkened with the shadows
                        of many sorrows not his own, and to these he has power to minister, were it
                        but with the kindly pressure of his hand, or the murmured blessing, or the
                        voice of tenderness, that soothes the troubled spirit like the soft wind
                        breathing on the stormy ocean.</p>
                    <p>Poor little Nanette had nothing to offer for her darling’s consolation, save
                        a few cheerful words and a bright look of affection, but it was quite enough
                        to dispel Millicent’s passing depression, and she was soon laughing merrily
                        at the details of her bonne’s reception in the housekeeper’s room.</p>
                    <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7183-118"/>
                    <p>She was left alone at last, and feeling that irresistible desire for a few
                        minutes of quiet thought, which so often takes possession of us at night,
                        she drew back the curtain from the window, and sat down to gaze out on the
                        still, fair landscape.</p>
                    <p>No one yet ever looked up into the midnight heavens, so intensely pure, so
                        awfully serene, where the great stars abide in changeless beauty, like the
                        glorious hopes that float through the calm soul of a saint, without feeling
                        the rising up within them of a strange desire,—a terror, an
                        uneasiness,—which they can neither explain nor define; no one, at least, who
                        is yet chained by a single thought, or hope, or wish to this world, and the
                        things of it. Some there have been, and are, who have so learned to fling
                        aside the clogging weight of earth’s affections, that already their
                        enfranchised spirit hath sought and found a home within those fields of
                        light so far off and so peaceful.</p>
                    <p>Not so with Millicent, however; she was<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7183-119"/>
                        still seeking the solution of life’s problem among the havens of this world,
                        and as she gazed into the lucid skies, and on the dark earth stretching out
                        before her, there crept over her that strange sense of loneliness which is
                        an indwelling instinct in the heart, and which we feel most often in a
                        crowd, in the presence of our fellow men, for it is the mysterious solitude
                        of the spirit that nought material can ever fill.</p>
                    <p>It is this void and craving of the mind which causes men so to labour and to
                        toil for the realization of their various hopes and visions; for they are
                        ever seeking madly to hew out from the dust and clay around them an aliment
                        for that vast spiritual hunger and desire.</p>
                    <p>Millicent had always felt most strongly the longing for that unknown good
                        which she believed was to be found in life, else she knew not why the life
                        had been given to her, and to‐night it seemed to come upon her with an
                        overwhelming power; for she had, she scarce knew why, been disap‐<pb n="119"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-120"/> pointed with her first evening in her new home.
                        During the long, monotonous years she had spent at Aix, she had ever looked
                        forward to her arrival in England as the event which was to open up for her
                        the treasure‐house of existence, where she might go in and find the
                        mysterious riches that were to satisfy her heart’s desire; and now she had
                        come, and it did not seem to her that the elements of which the Egerton
                        family were composed, were likely to afford her much insight into the uses
                        and purposes of life. Already, with the vivid imagination of youth, she
                        pictured to herself a daily routine of inoffensive occupations, similar to
                        those which had oppressed her in France, and her thoughts flew back to the
                        conversation she had held with John Forde, when he told her that the thing
                        she longed for was the spirit’s rest, and led her, by his ominous words, to
                        believe that this rest, for which the soul feels such a dire necessity, was
                        to be found only in human affection.</p>
                    <p>This conviction now re‐<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7183-121"/> turned with
                        redoubled strength, as she felt the chill of that dreary solitude of mind;
                        it seemed to her that to live in the life of another a necessary law of her
                        being,—that, in fact, the very power of existence must decay within her
                        unless there were some outer life to which she might link herself, and in
                        which she might exist.</p>
                    <p>There was the foreshadowing of a great truth in this belief of Millicent
                        Grey’s; it was the stirring within her of the instinctive knowledge that her
                        soul could not subsist alone,—that, except in union with a Being not her
                        own, even that immortal essence would expire and fade away. She struggling
                        with the inborn necessity of adoration and worship which filled her spirit,
                        and she prepared to seek an object for it in some form of human dust, flail
                        and erring as herself.</p>
                    <p>She believed that her rest was only to be found in daily, hourly toil for the
                        peace of some other,—that, in the entire devotion of her soul to the chosen
                        friend of earth<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7183-122"/> would be its entire
                        satisfaction, and, like all women, the craving was strong within her to find
                        a support and defence for her great weakness and helplessness in some
                        stronger arm and firmer heart.</p>
                    <p>So Millicent Grey lay down that night with a bright dream in her mind of some
                        such loving protection and repose of self‐devotion; but she little thought
                        how, by thus concentrating her whole faith and hope upon it, she was, in
                        fact, preparing to stake her life at a single venture.</p>

                    <p>“<hi>MY</hi> dear Millicent,” said Mrs. Egerton, the next morning, as she
                        sailed into the room with an air of consequential satisfaction, as though
                        she were aware that an invisible herald had preceded her in the minds of all
                        present, announcing to them the exalted position she ought to hold in their
                        esteem, “you will have little difficulty in becoming acquainted with our
                        mode of life, for when you have passed one day with us, you will know our
                        habitual routine of existence as completely as<pb n="123"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-124"/> though you had lived with us for a year.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you mean that every day in the year is exactly the same in this house: is
                        there never a variety of any kind whatever?” exclaimed Millicent, in some
                        alarm.</p>
                    <p>“Not any, I think, in the external arrangements, or what I would call the
                        outward machinery of our existence,” said Mrs. Egerton, pompously; “each
                        hour seems to have its natural and fitting occupation, from which we seldom
                        vary. Of course life is chequered at all times, and with us, as with others,
                        there are occasional circumstances which create change, though without
                        materially altering the ordinary course to which I alluded just now. For
                        instance, an event will occur in our family next autumn, which will cause us
                        all a very pleasing excitement.”</p>
                    <p>Next autumn! no events until next autumn. This was dreary news to Millicent.
                        Mrs. Egerton waited to be asked what this occurrence was, before she
                            spoke;<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7183-125"/> for she held it to be highly
                        unprofitable to do anything gratuitously, and she loved that even her words
                        should be demanded as a favour, and graciously accorded.</p>
                    <p>Millicent was not slow to gratify her; she was much interested in hearing
                        what was her first prospect of excitement.</p>
                    <p>“It is the arrival of my fourth daughter, Juliet, from the Continent,” said
                        Mrs. Egerton.</p>
                    <p>“I did not know you had another daughter,” said Millicent; “I thought I had
                        seen all the family.”</p>
                    <p>“All but this one, who is the youngest, and who has been passing some months
                        in Italy with a friend. Until you have seen her, Millicent, you cannot
                        understand how much reason, as a mother, I have to be proud. All my
                        daughters are greatly above par; I am quite aware of that, but Juliet is
                        something indeed remarkable, and totally unlike her sisters.”</p>
                    <p>“Is she, then, very handsome?” asked Millicent.</p>
                    <pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7183-126"/>
                    <p>“You innocent cousin!” said Charles, laughing heartily, “how very plainly you
                        have told us what you think of those you have already seen.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent felt she had done so, and coloured with annoyance at her own
                        imprudent speech. Mrs. Egerton was content, however, with the implied
                        compliment to her favourite daughter, and continued at once:—</p>
                    <p>“Handsome is not the word I should apply to her; she is much beyond that—she
                        is strikingly beautiful. Charles, I appeal to you, if this is not the case,
                        and you may rely on his opinion, Millicent, as he is peculiarly fastidious
                        on the subject of beauty.”</p>
                    <p>“There can be no question that Juliet is singularly beautiful,” said Charles;
                        “she is a remarkable person in every way: excessively clever, with an
                        indomitable will, and the most consummate selfishness,—the whole concealed
                        under a winning fascination of manner which I really believe has never<pb
                            n="126" xml:id="VAB7183-127"/> been surpassed. I have always thought
                        there was a good deal of the tiger in Juliet. The smooth, sleek, beautiful
                        coat, and the cold heart beating with its cruel purpose beneath it, is a
                        very apt simile for that captivating softness and most fair appearance which
                        gain Juliet the hearts of all who see her, and which hide the most subtle
                        calculations for her own continual gratification.”</p>
                    <p>Charles piqued himself on his talent for analyzing and describing character
                        in a graphic and energetic manner; he liked to treat individuals as a
                        species of complex machinery which he was skilled in explaining, and he was
                        rather pleased than otherwise when he had an opportunity of commenting on
                        his nearest relations with the same supreme indifference which he was
                        accustomed to manifest to the whole race of man. He merely slightly elevated
                        his eyebrows in reply to his mother’s vehement protestation against the
                        extraordinary manner in which he had thought fit to<pb n="127"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-128"/> qualify his sister, and sauntered away to receive
                        his letters from Mr. Egerton’s hand, who was unlocking the post‐bag with a
                        solemn and mysterious air, as though it were a matter of the first
                        importance. All the family were now assembled, with the exception of Arthur;
                        and Millicent began to watch their proceedings with the utmost anxiety, for
                        Mrs. Egerton’s intimation as to the uniformity of their habits had invested
                        the most insignificant of their acts with an awful importance in her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>She marveled at the pertinacity with which Mr. Egerton kept them all waiting
                        for their letters, whilst he carefully examined the address of each one, and
                        at the vivacity with which he literally threw himself upon the ball and rung
                        it, as soon as the clock began to strike the hour appointed for the family
                        prayers.</p>
                    <p>“Pray wait a moment before you ring,” exclaimed Fanny, already too late with
                        her request; “Arthur is just coming across the lawn; he will be here
                        immediately.”</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7183-129"/>
                    <p>“I never wait for any one,” replied Mr. Egerton, shouldering a huge
                        commentary (with which he daily confused the intellects of his servants,)
                        and taking his accustomed seat. It afforded him the most exquisite pleasure
                        to make this speech, for he shared in common with many estimable individuals
                        a peculiarity of temper, which rendered it intensely pleasant to him to make
                        little disagreeable speeches, which were often very cutting and humiliating
                        to those whom he addressed, and which he flung at them from the high ground
                        of his own superiority as the advocate of duty and propriety.</p>
                    <p>Punctuality was one of those virtues by which he succeeded in sinning
                        comfortably every day, inasmuch as by his excessive punctiliousness on that
                        head he caused the greatest discomfort and annoyance to his family.</p>
                    <p>Millicent walked to the window when prayers were over; and as it opened down
                        to the ground, she went out a few steps to breathe the sweet morning air.
                        She found<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7183-130"/> Arthur standing moodily near it.
                        He seemed to shrink from meeting her, and she was again most forcibly struck
                        with his forbidding appearance, which was the more evident in the blaze of
                        the sunlight; yet there was a soft and mournful expression in his eyes which
                        touched her, and a certain thoughtfulness in his countenance that is the
                        sure indication of mental powers.</p>
                    <p>She went up to him with a kind smile and a winning cordiality to which he
                        seemed little accustomed, for a flush of delight passed over his pale
                        face.</p>
                    <p>“You have been taking a long walk, I think,” she said. “I quite envy you, it
                        must have been so pleasant in these sunny, green fields, this morning.”</p>
                    <p>“It was indeed,” said Arthur, earnestly; “such an hour as I have passed might
                        almost give one courage for the bitterness which the long dull day brings
                        with it, at least to me,” he went on, seeming to speak to himself, and not
                        to her. “I have been deep in the woods, where there was not a<pb n="130"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-131"/> sight or a sound save those of the fair nature,
                        so glad and bright in its summer loveliness. I could breathe the fresh air
                        with delight, feeling it was untainted with the sighs which, from a thousand
                        bursting hearts, will have gone up to load it before the day is done, and
                        brush away the dew without fearing that I was trampling over the spot, where
                        some unnoticed agony had been poured out in secret tears.”</p>
                    <p>Milicent looked at him in astonishment; such bitterness of feeling was quite
                        inexplicable to her, for whom the existence of suffering was a mere matter
                        of faith; but Arthur continued like one thinking aloud, and well nigh
                        unconscious of her presence:—</p>
                    <p>“I could not help thinking, as I walked through those green paths this
                        morning, what a glorious world this would be if only the human mind were in
                        analogy to that sweet nature; were it pure, and in hope serene as those
                        unclouded skies, bright with the light of truth as that calm sunshine;
                        giving forth its fragrance in thoughts and words, gentle<pb n="131"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-132"/> and lovely as the odours breathing from the
                        flowers; dispensing its refreshing sympathy and intellectual aid upon the
                        parched and drooping souls around, like the cool stream wandering with its
                        life‐giving waters among the forest trees,—and so that Spirit, which is
                        beauty in the material world, shine forth as goodness in the man. But how
                        far otherwise in actual fact! There was but one mortal footstep in the
                        woodland path this morning, and, yet a very load of bitterness was carried
                        even then, through that pure atmosphere!”</p>
                    <p>He paused, and Millicent stood silent, fixing her large wondering eyes on the
                        speaker; but suddenly she was roused by the voice of Charles, who had
                        approached unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>“Miss Grey, I see you are mute in astonishment, from which I infer that
                        Arthur has been imparting to you some of his peculiar theories; I therefore
                        consider it my duty, for your future peace of mind in all intercourse with
                            him,<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7183-133"/> announce to you that our
                        respected brother is a poet. If you knew the world a little better, you
                        would understand that this fact accounts for the very sombre hue of his
                        existence, and for the fund of most melancholy information which it will be
                        his delight to convey to you. For <emph>poet</emph>, in the present day,
                        read—a well‐fed, well‐clothed, and highly discontented individual, who,
                        having nothing to complain of, complains of everything, who conceives
                        himself to be surrounded with the most bitter enemies in the bosom of his
                        affectionate family, and feels himself desperately alone when seated at the
                        tea‐table, where his anxious mother is handing him a plate of muffins. Awful
                        instances of the world’s hollowness are to be found in the society of his
                        unsympathetic maiden aunts, and the early duplicity of some of his
                        school‐fellows leaves rankling wounds which time cannot efface.”</p>
                    <p>Charles was an adept in the sneering coldness and contempt with which, in
                            these<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7183-134"/> our times, it is much the
                        fashion to trample on the very souls of our fellow creatures. We doubt if
                        many burdens will serve to weigh men down in their coffins so ably as the
                        load of that murderous carelessness with which they wound the feelings of
                        others, casting the blight of ridicule over things lovely and of good
                        report, and destroying ofttimes in their fellow men that faith in the
                        beautiful which they themselves have abandoned, in conformity with their
                        levelling and sophistical creed. Millicent, however, with her fresh
                        enthusiastic mind, was by no means disposed to adopt Charles’s views on the
                        subject, and she turned to Arthur with sparkling eyes.</p>
                    <p>“A poet! Oh, I am so glad! Are you indeed a poet?”</p>
                    <p>“I am so unfortunate,” he replied, in a low voice.</p>
                    <p>“Unfortunate! That is not the word to use. How can you so mistake your
                        calling? Oh, it is a glorious thing to be a poet, I know nothing of the
                            world;<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7183-135"/> but this, at least, I do
                        believe and know: it is a noble thing to make your way into the hearts of
                        thousands, and find an echo there to your own thoughts; a noble thing to be
                        a conqueror, more than ever warrior with his armed force, and that by your
                        sweet words only. Think what an empire of souls a poet wins to himself!”</p>
                    <p>“Miss Grey, you are rash, very rash,” said Charles; “you little know how
                        extremely dangerous the writing species are, or how slight an imprudence
                        will place you in their power. I can see already, with prophetic foresight,
                        the daily arrival of Arthur, with a long roll of MS. under his arm, to which
                        he will hold you bound to listen, after this incautious speech. I remember
                        once to have mentioned that I took some interest in scientific experiments
                        before the author of a treatise on chemistry, and the consequences were
                        awful.”</p>
                    <p>Arthur turned hastily away as his brother spoke, but Millicent, whose
                            gentle<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7183-136"/> heart was pained for him,
                        called him anxiously to her.</p>
                    <p>“Do not go,” she said, “your brother does not at all understand what an
                        intense charm there is for me in beautiful poetry. In fact, how can it be
                        otherwise with any one! I am sure you do not yourself feel as you would have
                        us think,” she continued, turning with a bright smile to Charles; “not to
                        appreciate poetry is to undervalue one of the sweetest things this world has
                        to offer us,—it is the very music of the mind.”</p>
                    <p>“My poor cousin,” said Charles, compassionately; “what a very uncomfortable
                        life you are preparing for yourself, if you continue at this unhealthy state
                        of feeling. Let me exhort you to reflect that an inordinate interest in any
                        thing or person, is wholly incompatible with that calm equanimity with which
                        we can alone, at all times, attend to our own peace of mind, and constantly
                        promote that condition of placid enjoyment which is quite attainable<pb
                            n="136" xml:id="VAB7183-137"/> in this world if we know how to take
                        proper care of ourselves; for instance, enthusiasm on any subject whatever
                        is altogether a work of supererogation. It is most desirable to divest
                        ourselves of it entirely, or it may be the cause of infinite trouble.”</p>
                    <p>“You are not a believer in your own creed,” said Millicent, laughing; “or if
                        you are, you must feel exactly like a fish.”</p>
                    <p>“Like a fish!” exclaimed Charles, startled out of his elegant repose of
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said Millicent, “the analogy may not have occurred to you, but it
                        strikes me forcibly, that peculiarly temperate state of mind to which you
                        think it advisable to reduce yourself is extremely similar to the remarkable
                        coolness of the atmosphere which pervades the whole existence of a fish. You
                        will admit that they are essentially cool, externally and internally. I
                        think we might even define the exact species which such a character as you
                        have described would most resemble. I<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7183-138"/>
                        should say, now, an oyster—very calm, very cool—an oyster must be safely
                        incased in his own shell, indifferent, we may believe, to the proceedings of
                        the pikes and the turbots around; not likely, I should imagine, to be very
                        enthusiastic, if even a mermaid were to sing by his side.”</p>
                    <p>During this speech, which Millicent delivered with much gravity, Charles
                        turned slowly round, aunt fixed his eyes full upon her. He met in return
                        only a glance of quiet merriment, and an involuntary smile passed over his
                        own face.</p>
                    <p>“Talking of fish,” he said, “I think I shall go to breakfast.”</p>
                    <p>“And now,” said Millicent to Arthur, when they were left alone, “you will not
                        say again it is unfortunate to be a poet.”</p>
                    <p>“And is it no misfortune,” exclaimed Arthur energetically, “to feel within
                        you the stirring of a high and lofty gift, and to know of no channel or
                        outlet whereby you may make it available for aught that is worth the
                        seeking! Is it nothing to know<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7183-139"/> that you
                        have a living power within you, which might subdue the minds of other men
                        and mould them to your pleasure, and to know of no principle for whose
                        upholding you would care to make the offering of your intellect,—or, rather,
                        to have so little love for men, that you would never give the noble energies
                        you feel within you, the needless effort of rousing them from the egotism
                        and frivolity which makes them so pitiable in your sight?—Is it nothing for
                        me to know that because of dire necessity my appearance,—my outward
                        appearance only,—is most repulsive in their eyes, they have so shut their
                        hearts against me, that I would rather my name were for ever forgotten; than
                        they should insult my grave with the honour due even to the highest fame,
                        when they made my life so desolate of all affection? Oh, Millicent! is it
                        nothing to feel on all points more acutely than tongue can ever tell! to
                        have an unhappy susceptibility, a miserable sensitiveness, which causes the
                        light word carelessly spoken to fall upon<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7183-140"/>
                        the soul like molten lead, and the cold look unconsciously given to chill,
                        as with the bleak wind of some desert, and to know that if ever you sought
                        to make these feelings known, and to obtain that sympathy, which is to the
                        heart what dew is to the flower, they would but mock, and could not
                        understand you?—This is to be a poet, and this is what I am; therefore I
                        said well that I am unfortunate.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent had no time to answer, for Sophia appeared at the window with a
                        request that Arthur would no longer detain his cousin from breakfast, which
                        desire she expressed to him with all the harshness and ungentleness which is
                        so common an accompaniment of that peculiar species of worth,—most
                        especially understood and appreciated by the possessor thereof.</p>
                    <p>Arthur moved quickly on at the sound of her voice, but as he passed Millicent
                        she showed him a flower, which she had just gathered, laden with the bright
                        tears of the morning.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7183-141"/>
                    <p>“Look,” she said, “how heavy it is with these refreshing drops; so
                        plentifully, while I live, the dew you spoke of shall fall upon your soul.”
                        He thanked her with a look of gratitude, and they returned into the
                        dining‐room together.</p>
                    <p>Now, both Millicent and Arthur were right; the one when she said it was a
                        noble thing to be a poet, and the other that it was a great misfortune, for
                        one or the other it will be to all who receive that perilous distinction at
                        their birth,—either a most glorious gift, or a most fearful curse.</p>
                    <p>It has not always been a noble thing to be a poet; it has been a most
                        debasing, a most despicable thing, when the rare talent and the winning
                        power have been given as ministers to falsity and vice,—when they have
                        ignored their high calling, their most glorious vocation, and for the
                        exaltation of sophistry or scepticism, have used that harp of angels, which
                        was placed in their hands, that with it they might echo in men’s ears the
                        songs angelic, and lure their souls with<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7183-142"/>
                        telling the surpassing beauty of celestial spheres,—.when, in a word, the
                        intellect of the poet has been made a slave to the passions of the man.</p>
                    <p>And again, it is in one sense a bitter misfortune to be a poet, for Arthur
                        spoke truly when he said that others of temperament less highly wrought, can
                        never understand the acuteness of their feelings, the intensity of their
                        affections; so that it ever seems to them as though they fell among rocks
                        and stones when they seek to make themselves a rest in the friendships or
                        the love of earth. They are cast in a finer mould than most men, and
                        therefore is the world too rough and hard for them; their imagination is too
                        ardent, their tenderness too deep, their susceptibility too keen; the evils
                        that are trifles light as air to others, wound them to the very soul; and
                        because their subtle shades of feeling and of suffering can never be
                        conceived or shared, their existence is a continual solitude.</p>
                    <p>But from this misfortune, for doubtless in<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7183-143"/>
                        itself it is such, they may, if they will, extract a wondrous blessing.
                        Since they cannot find repose in this world’s treasures, and truly never
                        shall, let them up, and betake them to that high path, where they shall meet
                        and hold companionship with the Seraphim, rich in love, and the Cherubim in
                        wisdom, and let them make it their right joyous task to draw after them,
                        with their alluring voice of melody, the souls of many that else would
                        struggle on amid clouds and shadows here, and never find that Way of
                        Light!</p>
                    <p>Millicent was so deeply impressed with her aunt’s remarks as to the extreme
                        regularity of life at Rookcliffe, that she devoted herself to the task of
                        watching the proceedings of the family on this day with much energy and
                        zeal. In fact, Fanny declared it made her perfectly nervous to have those
                        great brown eyes fixed on her at every moment, and to see them wandering
                        from one to another with a glance of such animated scrutiny. Her abrupt
                        remarks were<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7183-144"/> also decidedly startling to
                        those who had led a common‐place, monotonous, objectless life for so many
                        years with the utmost complacency.</p>
                    <p>It was not long before Millicent’s attention was forcibly attracted by the
                        entire devotion of Mrs. Egerton and her daughters to the manufacture of
                        worsted work, during the whole of that period of the day when they were not
                        out of doors. They were somewhat confused by her earnest entreaties that
                        they would tell her for what purpose, they were preparing those uncouth
                        representations of bandits, with eyes of floss silk and all those flowers of
                        unnatural dimensions and impossible hues. She seemed to think that since
                        they plainly devoted the greater part of their existence to this delectable
                        employment, they must surely have some hidden end; in view which would
                        render it quite worth while, that they should have been born, educated, and
                        carefully kept alive, by regular supplies of food, for this purpose
                        only.</p>
                    <p>When their answers failed to give her<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7183-145"/> any
                        definite information as to the ulterior use of their embroidered brigands,
                        she remained lost in thought, with her eyes fixed on the basket containing
                        the materials for this arduous labour, which caused them, as it were, to
                        work their way through the ocean of life, like so many ships under press of
                        canvass, and inwardly pondered whether the mysterious use of existence which
                        so bewildered her was really to be found in that basket.</p>
                    <p>The gentlemen had disappeared altogether, but they met again at luncheon, and
                        Millicent by a few well‐timed remarks succeeded in eliciting the nature of
                        their employments in the interval. Mr. Egerton had been reading the
                        newspapers, Charles had been seeing his horses fed, and Arthur had been
                        wandering in the woods. At the usual stated hour the carriage came round to
                        take the ladies for their drive; for as Mrs. Egerton informed Millicent,
                        after luncheon, the remainder of the day was always devoted to relaxation.
                        What they were to relax from, her niece could not imagine, nor<pb n="145"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-146"/> yet the exact aim and object of the two hours’
                        drive which she took with her aunt and cousins along the turnpike road. It
                        was not certainly to give them exercise, as they did not walk a step; nor
                        yet in order to breathe the fresh air, as the carriage was closed; and if it
                        was an amusement it seemed to her even more <foreign xml:lang="fre"
                            >lugubre</foreign> than the game of chess which had so astonished her
                        merry little <foreign xml:lang="fre">bonne</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>Millicent looked much astonished when Anne told her, as they passed through
                        the hall, that the dinner hour was seven o’clock.</p>
                    <p>“Do you dine twice every day,” she said, with much simplicity.</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean?” said Anne; “did you think we dined at luncheon time?”</p>
                    <p>“Why we certainly had enough to eat to serve us for the whole day,” replied
                        Millicent. Anne only answered by shrugging her shoulders contemptuously. It
                        is one of the singular facts of the present state of society, that the
                        qualities which in theory we hold to be most lovely and desirable<pb n="146"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-147"/> are precisely those which in practice we treat
                        with the greatest contumely and disdain. If one comes amongst us ignorant of
                        the world’s ways, innocent because uncontaminated by the knowledge of many
                        evil things, unlearned in the artificial laws and observances of
                        conventionalism,—with what contempt and sneering ridicule are they met by
                        those whose supposed superiority consists in the fact that they drag after
                        them, through the crowds they love so well, garments soiled with the dust
                        they have gathered on them in a many years’ contact with the world!</p>
                    <p>Millicent sat next Charles Egerton at dinner, and she was at first somewhat
                        silent, not having been long enough in England to know what a very important
                        and prominent place in society has been assumed by young ladies,—and how
                        impossible it would seem, by their own showing, that the affairs of the
                        Church, or the nation, should be conducted without their able interference.
                        She might have been somewhat enlightened<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7183-148"/>
                        in this respect by Sophia, who was in the habit of delivering a course of
                        lectures to Mr. Egerton at meal times, which nothing but his deep
                        pre‐occupation on such occasions could have enabled him to have endeared.
                        Charles, however, who had observed his cousin’s eyes glancing with their
                        look of bright intelligence from side to side, at last endeavoured to draw
                        from her the nature of her thoughts, which he saw was likely to afford him
                        some amusement.</p>
                    <p>“Pray tell us, Miss Grey, what peculiarity in our manners and customs is now
                        attracting your attention. You should remember that you have especial
                        advantages for working at least a theoretic reform in our social system,
                        since all is entirely new to you, which is a second nature to us, and
                        consequently you are capable of analyzing many of those anomalies which we
                        should never observe.”</p>
                    <p>“Indeed,” said Millicent, laughing, “it would be an immense relief to me if I
                        might talk openly of all I see, if I might<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7183-149"/>
                        be as impertinent as I please, in short; and after all, you know, it is I
                        who ought to be laughed at, for it is only my ignorance which causes me to
                        be so astonished at English customs; consider me as a savage, and then I
                        will tell you all I think.”</p>
                    <p>“Very like a savage,” said Charles, glancing at her sweet young face.</p>
                    <p>“But indeed, Millicent,” said Mr. Egerton, benignly, “I hope you will make
                        your comments on all you see. I like to hear your fresh, unsophisticated
                        remarks.”</p>
                    <p>Poor Mr. Egerton! he little knew all he was to suffer hereafter from the
                        excessive bewilderment caused by these same untutored reflections which he
                        thus encouraged in his niece. Millicent, however, had an instinctive
                        deference for her elders, and she preferred addressing herself to
                        Charles.</p>
                    <p>“Well, I must tell you that I am particularly astonished at all this
                        machinery, merely for the sake of eating.”</p>
                    <p>“What machinery?” asked Charles.</p>
                    <p>“Why the whole affair; the whole ela‐<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7183-150"/>
                        borate pageant, arranged with so much time and trouble. Look at those men,
                        with immortal souls, for instance, going round the table with so many
                        intricate evolutions, to which they are giving their entire intellect and
                        thoughts.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you mean the servants?” he said.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, the servants; but they have souls, and intellects, and capacities, you
                        know. Now, it is clear to me that their lives are devoted, as well as all
                        their mental faculties, to the task of helping us to eat according to an
                        elegant system. Just think what previous calculation and forethought they
                        must have given to that symmetrical display of forks and spoons on the
                        sideboard there. Who can tell what important discoveries in science they
                        might not have gained for their fellow‐creatures with the same exercise of
                        their mind otherwise directed?”</p>
                    <p>“It is rather a new view of the case,” said Charles.</p>
                    <p>“Then you know, it is not their time and life only, but ours also, that
                            seems<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7183-151"/> to me, in this country, to be
                        absorbed by the business of keeping in life. In reality, you know, it
                        requires a very short time. In Provence, the peasants, when they are hungry,
                        take a piece of bread and a bunch of cherries, and sit down under a tree to
                        eat them; it does not occupy them much more than five minutes; but here it
                        is really extraordinary how much time we employ in preparing to live. I have
                        been counting—an hour to breakfast, another to luncheon, two or three, at
                        least, for dinner, and coffee after it, another for tea and biscuits and
                        wine and water at night, so that it is about six hours altogether; now, if
                        there are twelve hours in the day, that is just half of it given to eating;
                        seven days in the week, three and a half occupied in feeding our bodies;
                        threescore years and ten for a man’s life, and he eats incessantly during
                        thirty‐five of them.”</p>
                    <p>“What an extraordinary calculation,” said Charles.</p>
                    <p>“True, nevertheless, you see. I am very<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7183-152"/>
                        untaught, very unlearned, and I am obliged to try to analyze life for
                        myself. Life, that is, as it is understood in my own country, and by persons
                        of my own station. I cannot let my existence slip away without ascertaining
                        the truth of those occupations which absorb it. But in order to do so, one
                        must see things as they really are, strip them of all borrowed clothing, and
                        look at them in their true colours. Now it does seem to me that we are for
                        ever making ready to live and never living. I have spoken only of eating;
                        but when you add to that, the time given to dressing and sleeping, I do not
                        think you will find that there is much left of a life‐time after the
                        preliminaries are attended to. It is like continually reading the preface,
                        and never coming to the book itself—always getting into the carriage for a
                        journey, and never driving anywhere.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Egerton looked bewildered, and Charles laughed; he glanced at his father,
                        and then said:</p>
                    <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7183-153"/>
                    <p>“But you forget that you would deprive us of one of the greatest pleasures we
                        have, if you denied us our comfortable repasts. Just fancy my father’s
                        feelings, dining upon a bunch of cherries under a tree instead of sitting
                        down to five courses and a dessert; you must remember that to enjoy is to
                        live.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, now you <emph>have</emph> reduced it to the very lowest level,”
                        exclaimed Millicent.</p>
                    <p>“Reduced what?” asked Charles.</p>
                    <p>“The business of life! What, do you mean to say that this noble creation of
                        man, this wonderful existence given to him, this fine intellect, this vast
                        capacity, this power of thought—that all this is intended for no other
                        purpose than that he, as an isolated being, should experience a personal and
                        solitary enjoyment in the gratification of his appetite,—the very lowest and
                        meanest qualification of his nature?”</p>
                    <p>“My dear Miss Grey, pray be cautious; you really alarm me. My nerves are
                        scarcely equal to such startling denunciations. I<pb n="153"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-154"/> thought my remark very innocent and sensible; I
                        can hardly imagine how you have drawn from it such a wholesale
                        condemnation.”</p>
                    <p>“Simply because, if you would test the real nature of a principle, you must
                        carry it on to the extremest verge to which it could ever reach, you must
                        judge of it in all its bearings, and work it out to the very uttermost. I
                        think we are very apt to hold principles in themselves intrinsically evil,
                        but which, up to a certain point, seem to be innocuous, and because we are
                        too well bred, or too indifferent, to go beyond that limit we never consider
                        what is their true tendency, and so freely indulge them. You distinctly said
                        that we were to spend half our short lives in eating, because it is a
                        pleasant occupation, and I only put that sentiment into other words.”</p>
                    <p>“Sophia, my dear, how do you feel?” exclaimed Charles, evidently anxious to
                        escape giving an answer; “‘Othello’s occupation’ seems to me to be gone into
                            other<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7183-155"/> hands; the wig and gown with
                        which metaphorically you have invested yourself for the last few years, in
                        order to sit in judgment on us all, has clearly been transferred to the head
                        and shoulders of our merry cousin here. Your essays on moral improvement
                        were nothing to her pithy remarks.”</p>
                    <p>“Millicent’s ideas seem to me to be remarkably confused,” said Sophia
                        sharply.</p>
                    <p>“Indeed they are,” said Millicent, very humbly; “I become more and more
                        confused with every thing I see and hear.”</p>
                    <p>“But you have sufficiently proved to what miserable things our lives are
                        given,” said Arthur, who sat on the other side of her; “will you not now say
                        to what they should be devoted? how should the time we might redeem from the
                        corrupt usages of society be occupied by us all?”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, that is the very difficulty which weighs upon me like the heaviest
                        burden,” said Millicent, her eyes filling with tears from the intensity of
                        her feelings; “I can see the<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7183-156"/> wrong, but I
                        cannot find the right. It is I who should ask that question; for I feel
                        myself, more than any other, ignorant and helpless; I feel the evil so
                        deeply that I know, were I to die now, I should have been useless in the
                        world as any clod of earth into which no mysterious flame of life had ever
                        passed. Only in one sense do I seem at times to have a dim comprehension of
                        what man might perform and might be. I know this world is full of misery, of
                        want, of suffering, of deadly guilt. There must be a reason for it
                        all,—there must be some dire evil at the root of it. The effect is dark and
                        dreadful, the cause must be more dark and dreadful still; but be it what it
                        may, it can be overcome, or at least combated, because good is more powerful
                        than evil. It seems to me, though I know not how it should be done, that it
                        were a noble task for the rich, for those who need not to labour for their
                        daily bread, the intellectual and educated class, to rise up and make
                        themselves a work in the succouring of their fellow men.<pb n="156"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-157"/> —It must be such au awful thing to suffer! Surely
                        to labour for the removal of the load of suffering from this earth were a
                        nobler system of life, than that which quenches the spirit, in a continued
                        provision for bodily comfort.”</p>
                    <p>She paused, quite ashamed of her own vehemence, and no one seemed inclined to
                        answer. After an awkward silence of a few minutes, Mrs. Egerton rose to go
                        to the drawing‐room, muttering to Anne, as Millicent passed her,—</p>
                    <p>“That girl’s extraordinary education has rendered her totally unfit for
                        reasonable society, or for ordinary life.”</p>
                    <p>“You will have some trouble with her, I can tell you,” was Anne’s reply; “I
                        should not be surprised if she brought discredit on the family by some
                        unheard of proceedings. She has no idea of the commonest rules of
                        society.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent meanwhile went to sit down musingly, pondering within herself, as
                        usual, how she could best reduce to practice the<pb n="157"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-158"/> theory she had just started, that it were a
                        fitting object for life to wrestle with human misery; and still it seemed,
                        as it had ever done, that for her, a weak woman, young and helpless as she
                        was, there was but one means whereby she could have a part in so glorious a
                        battle, and that it would be by concentrating all her energy on some one
                        life,—a life beloved,—and devoting herself to banish from it, by her
                        faithful tenderness, every shade of evil, and every cloud of sorrow. She
                        knew not then that there are other ways and means by which, in all ages,
                        timid women have come forth as dauntless soldiers to battle with mortal
                        suffering, that universal foe; and how by self‐devotion they have found a
                        wondrous strength and power, most foreign to their nature, and have gone to
                        court the strife, in noisome haunts where most it rages, fiercely braving
                        the pestilence, and all the fouler diseases of moral ills.</p>
                    <p>Millicent Grey knew nothing of all this, nor would she have been equal to it;
                        for in<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7183-159"/> truth the sweet dream of human
                        love, to which she had given up her whole power of hope, had fascinated her
                        so completely that her eyes could discern no other light in life.</p>

                    <p><hi>SEVERAL</hi> days had passed away, and Millicent, who was thoroughly
                        grateful for the real kindness with which she was treated by the Egerton
                        family, was now quite at home amongst them, and as gay as ever. It is true,
                        they did not seem to her to take any very animated or very profound view of
                        existence, but they never interfered either with her ideas or her actions,
                        and left her quite free to choose her own mode of life. She also found no
                        small pleasure in the society of Arthur,<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7183-161"/>
                        notwithstanding the morbid and unnatural state of feeling into which he had
                        fallen, from a total misapprehension of his condition on this earth.</p>
                    <p>He was as much bewildered as she was by the false lights and strange shadows
                        that surround us in the world, and on which alone his eyes were fixed; but
                        it was at least a mutual satisfaction to them both, to speculate together on
                        all the deep questions which they most vainly sought to penetrate with their
                        unassisted intellect. Truly for poor Arthur, misunderstood and little cared
                        for in his own family, it was as though the whole earth had become full of
                        sunshine and brightness when, day after day, he met the sweet smile of his
                        gentle‐hearted cousin, and knew that he should hear her kind words of
                        sympathy.</p>
                    <p>“I find we have a new neighbour,” said Mr. Egerton, walking into the drawing
                        room, where the whole party were assembled one morning. “I have just
                        received a letter from a friend, introducing to me<pb n="161"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-162"/> a gentleman who has taken Milton Lodge for the
                        summer.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, do tell us all about him,” exclaimed Fanny, the only one of the family
                        sufficiently natural to give vent to the curiosity which all felt alike.</p>
                    <p>“Lord —— tells me,” replied Mr. Egerton, “that he is an intimate friend of
                        his, a man of excellent family and large fortune. His name is
                        Bentley—Colonel Bentley—he acquired no small reputation in his profession;
                        but, poor fellow, he is quite disabled now. I have a note from him, saying
                        that he is too great an invalid ever to leave home, but that he begs me to
                        call upon him.”</p>
                    <p>“He is a married man, probably?” suggested Mrs. Egerton, carelessly.</p>
                    <p>“On the contrary, he never had a wife. I believe his nephew is his heir, and
                        he will have a very handsome income.”</p>
                    <p>“Is he an old man?” asked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Why, not exactly what I should call old; about my standing, I should
                        say.”</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7183-163"/>
                    <p>“Oh!” Anne made no other answer than this significant monosyllable.</p>
                    <p>“He is, then, old enough to come into the list of those whose age entitles
                        them to the benefit to be derived from my ‘Tracts for the Elderly,’” said
                        Sophia, her calm, measured voice; “I am glad of it.”</p>
                    <p>“My dear Sophia,” said Charles, “you don’t suppose the man to be without
                        education; I thought your essays were for the ignorant.”</p>
                    <p>“You are right as to my intention in the publication,” replied Sophia, “but I
                        can assure you that nowhere have I found such ignorance of the peculiar
                        principles I wish to inculcate, as amongst those whose station in life would
                        have led one to hope better things.” She turned her eyes, as she spoke, full
                        upon her father; Mr. Egerton, however, endured the glance without wincing,
                        being hardened into indifference to the schooling most plentifully bestowed
                        upon him by his youngest daughter.</p>
                    <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7183-164"/>
                    <p>“How I should like to see this old gentleman,” exclaimed Millicent; “he would
                        be something new!”</p>
                    <p>“Well, my dear, I know of no reason why you should not be gratified,” said
                        Mr. Egerton. “Colonel Bentley is accompanied by his widowed sister, Mrs.
                        Hartley, on whom Mrs. Egerton must call to‐day, and you had better go with
                        us.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent agreed, although she had hitherto always eschewed the daily
                        funereal drive in the family hearse, when it seemed to her that they ever
                        went with much pomp, to bury their superfluous time. She met Arthur’s glance
                        of disappointment, who appeared to think there would be a sunbeam less in
                        the woods if she did not go with him to wander through them, as was their
                        wont nearly every day, and she murmured, as she past him, a few of those
                        gentle, kindly words that come like sweet music into the life of those to
                        whom is given that intensity of tenderness, which is a gift so beautiful and
                        yet so perilous.</p>
                    <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7183-165"/>
                    <p>A short drive brought Millicent, with her uncle and aunt, to Milton Lodge.
                        Mrs. Hartley was alone in the drawing‐room when they went in. She was a very
                        old widow lady, most simple in manner and appearance, but with a face which
                        to look on was to love. The mild blue eyes, full of that calm look of sorrow
                        which the many tears of widowhood alone can give, and the sweet expression
                        lingering round the placid mouth, all spoke so eloquently of the truthful
                        simplicity and perfect unselfishness of her character. Very childlike was
                        her gentle spirit, for to her no gift of intellect or power of mind was
                        given, but the far richer portion, of humility and willing submission, and a
                        heart that ever beat with warmest sympathy towards her fellow‐creatures. The
                        deep, unchanging grief which, with the passing of her husband’s spirit, had
                        entered into hers, had been, during the long years of solitude that
                        followed, as a blessed angel sitting by her side, and talking to her ever
                        with words of wisdom and love. </p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7183-166"/>
                    <p>She welcomed her new acquaintance with much cordiality, but Millicent was at
                        a loss to account for the peculiar smile which passed over her face as she
                        took the young girl’s hands; her astonishment soon ceased, however,—there
                        was a sound of some one coming along the passage on crutches, and Colonel
                        Bentley entered, followed by a very tall servant. Mr. and Mrs. Egerton met
                        him with all due formality, but their amazement was great when Millicent,
                        bounding from her seat, flew towards him, and expressed the utmost delight
                        at seeing him again.</p>
                    <p>“I told you we should meet in England,” said he; “why you fairly bewitched
                        me, Miss Grey! I think you will admit I have lost no time in establishing
                        myself as near to you as I could.” He then detailed to her uncle and aunt
                        the acquaintance they had made on board of the French steamer, and further
                        declared positively, that he had come to settle in this neighbourhood for
                        the sole purpose of being near her. He said he<pb n="166"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-167"/> had just left the Continent, where he had vainly
                        been seeking to recover his health, and finding his efforts quite fruitless,
                        he had resolved on making a home to himself in his own country, which he
                        designed to quit no more.</p>
                    <p>“I had no tie, however, to any particular locality,” he continued, “and after
                        having met with this,—excuse me, I must speak plainly,—this charming little
                        witch here, it seemed to me that life would be so greatly improved by the
                        addition of her society, that I determined on making my new abode as near to
                        her as I could.”</p>
                    <p>Colonel Bentley stumbled a good deal over the latter part of this speech, as
                        if he were quite aware that he was not telling <emph>all</emph> his motives,
                        to say the least of it, and Mrs. Hartley smiled gently whilst she looked
                        with evident interest on Millicent. The Egertons were, however, extremely
                        well pleased that their niece should have gained the friendship of an old
                        gentleman so exceedingly <emph>comfortable</emph>, in every sense of<pb
                            n="167" xml:id="VAB7183-168"/> the word, as Colonel Bentley, and
                        expressed themselves much gratified thereby. The same thought was on the
                        minds of both, that it is not in novels only, that attractive young ladies
                        receive unexpected bequests from elderly gentlemen of easy and pliant
                        dispositions; such things they reflected have been in every‐day life, and
                        might be again, Perhaps Colonel Bentley guessed the idea that was working in
                        their minds, for there was considerable merriment in the recasting glance
                        which he cast at his sister, but he proceeded to follow up what was
                        evidently a settled purpose with him.</p>
                    <p>“Now, Mrs. Egerton, since I have been very frank in avowing the attraction
                        which has brought me here, I hope you will kindly allow me as much of your
                        niece’s society as she will consent to bestow on an infirm old man.”</p>
                    <p>“And an old lady scarce less infirm,” added Mrs. Hartley, with a smile. “I am
                        afraid your invitation is not very tempting, brother, to such a spring
                        flower as this.”</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7183-169"/>
                    <p>“Perhaps not, but I am very selfish; I should like to see this bright face
                        every day, if I could.”</p>
                    <p>“And so you shall,” exclaimed Millicent warmly; “I know I may come.” She
                        looked appealingly to her aunt, who graciously signified her assent. “I will
                        come whenever you will let me, it will make me so happy.” She pressed Mrs.
                        Hartley’s hand involuntarily as she spoke, for the gentle old lady, with her
                        simple quiet words, had greatly prepossessed her. Colonel Bentley, however,
                        was not yet content; telling Mrs. Egerton he had still a request to make, he
                        begged her to allow Millicent to remain with him now, whilst they proceeded
                        to pay some other visits they had in view, and they could return for her on
                        their way home. To this they also agreed, and Millicent soon found herself,
                        greatly to her delight, alone with her kind old friend, whom she seemed to
                        have known for years. He was in the greatest glee, and looked as if he could
                            have<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7183-170"/> danced round her, crutches and
                        all. Had Millicent been somewhat less guileless, she might have seen very
                        clearly that Colonel Bentley had certainly some purpose in view respecting
                        her, which had induced him thus to seek her out, and now determinately
                        monopolize her society; but she only thought of the pleasure of renewing the
                        friendship which had sprung up so rapidly, and of the great relief it would
                        be to her to escape to Milton Lodge, when the ponderous vacancy of the
                        respectable and harmless existence at Rookcliffe became intolerable.</p>
                    <p>They had sat talking some little time, when Colonel Bentley rose and summoned
                        Millicent to come with him to the library, where he said there was a
                        treasure he wished to show her. She followed as he led the way, and opening
                        the door he stood back to let her pass. She paused one moment on the
                        threshold; one moment she stood there, turning round upon that old way‐worn
                        man her cloudless eyes, with their candid, confiding gaze, telling so
                            eloquently<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7183-171"/> of a spirit that,
                        child‐like, knew nothing as yet, either of the deep joys or the deep sorrows
                        of this life, whose depths had never been stirred to tell what mighty power
                        of feeling and of suffering was there, over whose clear surface the wings of
                        time had passed as over a calm limpid sea, where no blast of destiny, swift
                        and viewless, had roused the lurking storms and called the human passions
                        like foaming waves to life.</p>
                    <p>Thus stood she,—though she knew it not,—on the threshold of her youth’s sweet
                        spring, from which she was about to pass for ever into that first summer of
                        the soul, when the sunshine of earthly love shines upon it, and calls forth
                        every latent power of thought and feeling, even as the warm, glowing beams
                        draw out the fragrance from the flowers. She turned and entered the room,
                        and with that one step she passed into a new era in her existence, where she
                        never more could be, as she had been.</p>
                    <p>The first object which attracted her attention was a large oil painting,
                        seemingly fresh<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7183-172"/> from the hands of the
                        artist, which stood on an easel near the window; and as her eye fell upon
                        it, immediately on entering the room, it seemed to her so strikingly
                        beautiful, that, without looking to the right or left she hurried forward to
                        examine it. The subject which it represented was somewhat singular, but so
                        ably executed, that Millicent stood transfixed with admiration.</p>
                    <p>It was evidently the production of a mind of high refinement, and great
                        purity of taste, whilst every line bore the incontestable stamp of genius.
                        The scene represented a wild and frowning landscape, a very desert of savage
                        mountains, where huge rocks rose menacing through mist and clouds, while
                        deep precipices and chasms were lost in a portentous darkness. In the very
                        midst of this abode of gloom and terror, stood one solitary female figure of
                        the most exquisite grace and beauty; her robes of purest white, her fair
                        head, veiled with her waving golden hair, her calm, and clear blue eyes,
                        turning with a gaze<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7183-173"/> evidently of deepest
                        tenderness on some unseen object, afforded a most striking contrast with the
                        dark and terrible nature all around. That stern solitude with its
                        inaccessible heights, and fearful depths, offered to the mind only the most
                        dismal images of utter loneliness and gloom; but when the gaze turned on
                        that radiant figure, on whose half‐parted lips the glowing smile told of joy
                        and gladness, as eloquently as the soft eyes spoke of fond affection, all
                        the promise and the hopes of life seemed embodied there, and she looked like
                        the representative and dispenser of the whole rich happiness which earth is
                        believed to offer man.</p>
                    <p>The picture was painted in the style of some of the old Italian masters, but
                        it possessed none of that devotional character which mostly hallows those
                        divine works of art, many of which were consecrated and inspired by
                        prayer;—far other was the spirit breathing through this splendid painting.
                        Ethereal‐looking and lovely as was that<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7183-174"/>
                        figure, standing forth so white and fair amid the gloom—it was no angel, but
                        a mere woman, beautiful with the beauty at which the expectant worms
                        mock,—radiant with the ardour of earthly hopes, and on some earthly object
                        fixing that tender and speaking glance.</p>
                    <p>Millicent gazed at it long, silent, and motionless, then, drawing a long
                        breath, she exclaimed,‐</p>
                    <p>“How wonderfully beautiful!”</p>
                    <p>Instantly there was a slight movement behind her, as of one drawing near; she
                        turned, and her gaze fell upon that face whose image was to pass before her
                        spirit when her eyes were closing for ever on the light of day,—and a voice,
                        whose echo was to linger on her heart, when already with a dull faint
                        beating it was fluttering beneath. the hand of death, came sounding on her
                        ear.</p>
                    <p>“So sincere a tribute as yours is worth a world’s praise.”</p>
                    <p>“Why, Stephen, I did not know you<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7183-175"/> were here
                        when I brought my charming little friend to see your picture, but I am glad
                        you have had such an honest proof of the admiration it deserves;” said
                        Colonel Bentley. “And now, Miss Grey, I must introduce the artist to you as
                        my nephew, Stephen Aylmer; he is my sole surviving relative, besides my
                        sister, so I must pray you to be very friendly with him.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent offered her hand to Aylmer with her usual frankness, and again
                        looked up into the noble face that was bent down to her, thinking as she did
                        so that she had never seen a countenance which bore so plainly the impress
                        of a fine mind, and an elevated character, and wondering at the singular
                        charm of the sweet smile that tempered so well his gravity of thought.</p>
                    <p>Stephen Aylmer had received many rare gifts wherewith to make himself a noble
                        destiny on earth, if so he willed it. Of these the most powerful was,
                        perhaps, the great fascination which he possessed over the minds of others.
                        His personal<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7183-176"/> appearance, his genius, his
                        kind and generous disposition, all united to give him an irresistible
                        ascendancy with whomsoever he would. He was a man of great talent and of
                        strong feelings. In this age, when knowledge is around us like the blaze of
                        the noonday sun, the light of truth fails not to pass before the eyes of
                        all;—it passes immutable, unchanging; and the influence of its pure beams on
                        the soul of each is either like the power of the sun‐rays when, stealing
                        over the kindly grateful soil, they cause its hidden treasures to germinate,
                        and bear much fruit, and many fragrant flowers; or like those same rays
                        sweeping over the cold deceitful waters of the sea that gather not from them
                        a spark of warmth or of life. Now the proud, strong spirit of Stephen Aylmer
                        had met the flood of light divine as the chill waters of the ocean meet the
                        sun. He acknowledged the glory and the surpassing beauty of that moral
                        brightness; he no more doubted whence came those living beams, than men
                        could doubt that the<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7183-177"/> sunshine streams from
                        heaven. Yet it penetrated not deeper into his life and heart, than the
                        earthly light beneath the cold dark billows. He held the faith as an
                        hereditary possession like his name, or the unstained honour of his family,
                        but he yielded obedience to none, save his own will; he ruled himself solely
                        by the dictates of his own understanding. He abhorred vice, not because the
                        voice of truth had proclaimed it abhorrent, but because he himself conceived
                        it low and degrading, unworthy the possible elevation of the human nature.
                        Nevertheless the soul of man demands a worship; it cannot exist without
                        adoring, and if it bow not to the Supreme Perfection, it will prostrate
                        itself before some outward expression of that Unseen Power. Now, that which
                        to Stephen Aylmer supplied the place of a legitimate adoration was the
                        worship of the Beautiful;—he gave up his life to seek and cherish it,
                        wherever it might be found,—in the scenes of nature, in the human face, and
                        in the higher works of<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7183-178"/> art. He adored also
                        the moral beauty of goodness; he sought it in others, he cultivated it in
                        himself, but he rested in his own proud independence of mind alone for the
                        attainment of all virtue and excellence. He would not be degraded, he would
                        not be corrupted by evil, and therefore he <emph>would</emph> be generous,
                        honourable, unstained by any vice; not because he was so commanded, but
                        because he so willed. He had lived nearly thirty years when he first looked
                        on Millicent Grey, and as yet his unsound theory had apparently upheld him
                        in all rectitude and goodness;—no unworthy action had ever sullied his fair
                        fame. He was honoured and beloved for his rectitude, and for his amiable and
                        noble disposition, whilst the admiration excited by his talents and genius
                        seemed only to render him more kind and gentle to all.</p>
                    <p>He believed himself very secure on the high ground he had chosen, but he knew
                        not what ungovernable passions lay hid in the depth of his soul, which no
                        human will, not<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7183-179"/> even his who called
                        himself master of his own spirit, could restrain. It was strange that these
                        had never been called forth in any shape; but his life had been very bright
                        and tranquil. He had devoted his time almost entirely to the cultivation of
                        the fine arts; he had lived much in Italy, enjoying the free poetical
                        existence of the artist, which is too wandering and gay to admit the
                        exercise of any very strong feelings. Aylmer had never felt a deep or
                        powerful affection, not because he had not the capacity for it, but because
                        he had it too intensely,—his ideal had never yet been found. Many a fair
                        face had haunted his dreams from time to time, but no attachment had ever
                        taken root in his heart. He knew not what it was either to hate or to love,
                        therefore had he easily maintained that calm dignity of excellence. But too
                        surely, yet a little while, and some rushing wind would come to blow to
                        flame the smouldering fire of his soul’s deep passions, and then would he
                        find that the fair structure he had built up, the noble<pb n="179"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-180"/> character and blameless life, were set on a
                        foundation of shifting sand.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was altogether dependent on Colonel Bentley, being the only child of
                        his sister, who had married a ruined man, and died in the same year as her
                        husband, whilst he was quite a child. They left nothing but debts to a large
                        amount, which Colonel Bentley paid, and adopted his nephew, designing to
                        make him his heir. This was, however, entirely a matter of choice; he could
                        dispose of his fortune as he would, and Stephen had no legal claim upon him.
                        This state of utter dependence would doubtless have been very galling to the
                        young man but for the excessive affection shown him by his uncle; their
                        wishes were never in opposition, for Colonel Bentley so habitually indulged
                        him in everything, that Aylmer was always ready on his part to make
                        occasional sacrifices to his uncle’s desires.</p>
                    <p>In the present instance, Stephen had returned from the Continent to reside
                            at<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7183-181"/> Milton Lodge, in accordance with
                        Colonel Bentley’s request, although he had only partially revealed to him
                        his reasons for requiring it. He had told him, what was the case, that he
                        was exceedingly anxious he should marry, but he had not communicated the
                        more important fact, that he had already fixed on the person he should wish
                        him to choose.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Bentley had never ceased to regret his own deficiency in this
                        respect; as a young man, being fond of a free and merry life, he had rather
                        avoided any family <corr>encumbrances</corr>, but when, later, he found
                        himself a helpless cripple, condemned almost entirely to solitude, and
                        delivered over to the care of hired attendants, it was then that he longed
                        for some gentle wife to be his faithful companion, ministering to all his
                        wants and comforts. The one great mistake which he told Millicent he had
                        made in youth, was simply his having failed to marry when it was in his
                        power. And certainly his lamentations were not<pb n="181"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-182"/> without reason, as Stephen was much absent, and
                        Mrs. Hartley could only leave her children, who were dispersed in the world,
                        at rare intervals, in order to be with him.</p>
                    <p>It was not unnatural, under these circumstances, that he should feel very
                        anxious, since he could no longer remedy his own mistake, to prevent his
                        nephew falling into the same, both because he really believed it essential
                        to Aylmer’s happiness that he should marry, and also because, as he fully
                        intended that his favourite nephew should always reside with him, he would
                        secure in his new niece, a useful companion, whose duty it would be to
                        perform for him all those little offices, which belong especially to a
                        woman’s province.</p>
                    <p>Stephen Aylmer possessed much of the old chivalrous feeling respecting women,
                        and his bearing towards them was full of grace and gentleness, although no
                        one could be more essentially manly in his habits and address. Millicent
                        felt the charm of his manner during the conversation which en‐<pb n="182"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-183"/> sued between them, and he seemed pleased and
                        amused at the lively and novel view she took of most subjects.</p>
                    <p>They had advanced considerably in their acquaintance when Mr. and Mrs.
                        Egerton arrived to reclaim their niece. They did not alight, and as
                        Millicent rose to go to the carriage, she paused once again before the
                        picture, and gazed intently on it: then she looked up with a bright smile to
                        Aylmer, and quoted the words of the poet:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <l>“Oh, that a desert were my dwelling‐place,</l>
                        <l>With one fair spirit for my minister.”</l>
                    </quote>
                    <p>His smile answered hers.</p>
                    <p>“You are quite right,—you have caught the idea. I have endeavoured to embody
                        on that canvass my ideal of beauty,—of such beauty as, beaming from one
                        human face, could make the savage desert, indeed, a dwelling place of light
                        and joy.”</p>
                    <p>“I doubt, however, if anything so beautiful does exist in human shape.”</p>
                    <p>“I almost begin to fear it,—at least, I<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7183-184"/>
                        fear that my ideal exists not,—for I do not consider this in any degree a
                        successful expression of my own vision.”</p>
                    <p>“What must your ideal be, if this is not beautiful enough?” exclaimed
                        Millicent.</p>
                    <p>“Ideals indeed!” shouted Colonel Bentley, shaking his crutch impatiently. “I
                        have no patience with your visionary pieces of perfection; they are all very
                        well in theory, but I can tell you they would be most useless, uncomfortable
                        companions. Just fancy asking that ethereal‐looking; individual in the white
                        gown, whom you have painted there, to come and shake up one’s cushion, or
                        bring one a footstool? Take my word for it, Stephen, if your seraphic vision
                        were to come flying in just now, for she certainly could not walk, along
                        with some active, merry, sweet tempered little being, of nature’ s own
                        making, you would soon bow your ideal out, and tell the footman to show her
                        the window, that she might make a poetical exit, while you sat down to your
                        dinner with a good honest<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7183-185"/> bit of flesh and
                        blood. No, no,—I have no fancy for your ideals. I dare say you have got one,
                        too, Miss Grey,—a very fierce and interesting brigand, with black hair and a
                        mystery over his birth; but, my dear little love, let me assure you, you
                        would not be at all comfortable, making tea for a brigand, especially if he
                        took it with his mask on.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think I should, indeed,” said Millicent, laughing heartily; “I am
                        not famous for courage; but, in the meantime, I have an uncle and aunt
                        waiting for me, who are very real and substantial, and not at all visionary;
                        so I fear I must go.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, promise to come back every day.”</p>
                    <p>“I will, indeed, if I can,” said Millicent; and she went to the carriage,
                        accompanied by Aylmer. Mr. and Mrs. Egerton were extremely gracious to him,
                        and hoped to see him often; and so terminated the visit to which Millicent
                        Grey looked back when on her death bed, as the crisis of her destiny.</p>

                    <p><hi>MR. AYLMER</hi> called at Rookcliffe next day, and having paid a visit of
                        considerable length, he was about to take leave, when the horses were
                        brought round for the Egertons and their cousin, who were going to ride; and
                        Mrs. Egerton proposed, as he had come on horseback, that he should join the
                        party. To this he willingly agreed, and they were soon on their way to the
                        common, through which Millicent had passed on the night of her arrival. They
                        were all there<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7183-187"/> excepting, of course, Mr.
                        and Mrs. Egerton, and Sophia, who had passed out of the hall‐door, in the
                        most elaborate manner, with a basket of Tracts, just as the others were
                        preparing to mount; and having anxiously waited to be asked where she was
                        going, which she at last happily accomplished, she replied that the curate
                        of the village had greatly unsettled the mind of one of <emph>her</emph>
                        flock, and that she was now going to warn him that he must on no account
                        attend to that gentleman’s advice, but to her own instructions only.</p>
                    <p>Millicent Grey had never been face to face with the poor—that dark, that
                        awful, that mysterious portion of this world’s vast system had never passed
                        before her eyes, that one black page in earth’s history, which changes not
                        from age to age, bearing ever the same record in the single word <emph
                            rend="sc">MISERY</emph>, had not as yet been unrolled to her gaze. She
                        was like many others, who live and<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7183-188"/> die in
                        this country, with its millions of paupers, without ever having looked on
                        poverty.</p>
                    <p>They would think you mocked them if you told them so. They would say that
                        surely they had often seen the wretched beggars in the street, and that
                        yearly they gave a large portion of their income to charitable institutions.
                        It may be so; they know not what is poverty. Have they ever gone to pass
                        days and nights in attendance on the sick and dying, amongst those crowds of
                        miserable wretches who herd together in damp, black cellars, to watch there
                        all the various shapes and stages of the agony of want?</p>
                    <p>Have they seen them seeking to forget in sleep the raging pangs of
                        hunger,—dreaming of food, and waking to curse life, and weep for death?</p>
                    <p>Have they heard that cry, simple, familiar, daily ascending—but into which
                            is<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7183-189"/> gathered the extreme of mortal
                        anguish—“My children are perishing for want of food, and I have none to
                        give?”</p>
                    <p>Have they seen parents blessing the pestilence which sweeps away the babes
                        they have carried on their bosom? or bending over them when dying in the
                        lingering horror of starvation, and feeling all the strong love returning,
                        so that they would yet retain them even to their life of misery, well
                        knowing one morsel—one little morsel—might redeem them from the jaws of
                        death—and yet that morsel is unattainable, and they expire?</p>
                    <p>Have they seen the man with the strong life struggling in him, lying before
                        the stores of food, where all that could tempt the appetite is separated
                        from him by the frail, clear glass?—have they thought on his superhuman
                        virtue, who stretches not out his hand to take the means of life, when his
                        nature was revolting against the death<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7183-190"/> of
                        exhaustion? It were a crime, no doubt, for which men who fare sumptuously
                        every day would sit in judgment on him and condemn him, with stern rebuke,
                        to punishment. A crime, truly; but in whom? In those, surely, who withhold,
                        as much as in the maddened wretch who steals.</p>
                    <p>They have not known poverty, they have not seen it, till they have so felt it
                        that they turn in horror from their own luxurious boards and look in fear on
                        the comfort of their homes—asking themselves by what right they enjoy one
                        item of superfluity whilst at the door of their very souls a million fellow
                        creatures stand knocking, saying, “Give us food, give us food, we
                        perish!”</p>
                    <p>Millicent knew nothing of all this, yet she had learned theoretically that
                        there was want and sorrow in this world, and she often wondered what it was
                        that she felt so repugnant in Sophia Egerton’s charity.</p>
                    <pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7183-191"/>
                    <p>She had a vision of Charity such as we have spoken of already, one whose feet
                        she would have kissed, could she have met her stealing in secret through the
                        dark haunts of wretchedness, so gentle, so humble, so loving—none knowing
                        whither she goes, or whence she comes—braving the contagious sickness of all
                        the noisome atmosphere, cold and heat, fatigue and long unrest, if only her
                        presence can give comfort; enduring the rude, unholy words of evil men, the
                        sights and sounds of blasphemy and vice, nor heeding that the delicately
                        nurtured might shun her after, lest she suffer by the contact. Some such
                        vision as this had Millicent; yet she was always angry at herself for not
                        sufficiently appreciating Sophia’s exertions.</p>
                    <p>The truth was, that Millicent Grey, quick sighted as she certainly was in
                        detecting many of the popular fallacies and familiar little sins which, like
                        so many respected<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7183-192"/> family friends, are
                        everywhere received and cherished in society, had not yet distinguished
                        between the meek, voiceless, all‐enduring charity which, heaven be praised,
                        has a wide though hidden dominion in our lands, and a certain species of
                        convivial benevolence, quite peculiar to England, and most universal
                        there.</p>
                    <p>There is a whole system of sociable, open‐mouthed alms‐giving, which is most
                        intensely pleasant to human nature, and especially to that nature as
                        developed in the inhabitants of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>Religion being essential to respectability among us, we are obliged to dress
                        up our pleasures in a monk’s cowl and gown, before we can go out walking
                        with them in the eyes of the world.</p>
                    <p>Now nothing looks the religious so well as that busy, excited, talkative
                        charity, that drives to cottage doors in a carriage filled with sympathizing
                        friends, and holds<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7183-193"/> meetings to discuss
                        soup kitchens and blanket clubs, ever comparing notes with others equally
                        zealous, as to the amount of good that has been done,—promoting in every
                        possible way the <emph>public</emph> performance of that duty, which is to
                        be accomplished by the left hand unknown to the right, and talking as openly
                        of their charitable prowess as if they were recounting their misdoings in
                        self‐imposed penance.</p>
                    <p>Millicent had not quite understood this as yet, so she looked thoughtfully
                        after Sophia and her basket, till the voice of Aylmer at her side recalled
                        her from her reflections.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer’s conversation was striking and full of talent: he waged war against
                        all common places, and when he was conversing with any one who could
                        understand him, he invariably chose subjects of some depth and importance,
                        on which he could exercise the powers of his fine mind. This was great
                        enjoyment to Millicent, who could never be content with<pb n="193"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-194"/> the surface of things. She was perpetually diving
                        to the bottom of wells in search of truth, and she was quite happy when she
                        found any one willing to dive along with her, instead of passing by on the
                        beaten path, as most of her present friends did, who were content, as she
                        said, to cast a glance of pity on her so perplexed in her well, whilst they
                        themselves followed the road, right or wrong, which others chalked out for
                        them, and wondered what made her take so much trouble.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was pleased with her frank simple manner, and amused by her lively
                        remarks. The conversation was so interesting that it was not until they had
                        ridden several miles that Millicent remembered she had not addressed a word
                        to Arthur, who was riding silently by her side.</p>
                    <p>There was a great change in Arthur Egerton, since the sweet face of his
                        cousin had come beaming in upon his dark life like<pb n="194"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-195"/> a star: the immense ambition which so long had
                        sounded in his heart like thunder, still was echoing there, for it was the
                        voice of the divine gift within him, that cried out to be employed on the
                        high mission for which alone the poetic spark of heavenly fire was ever sent
                        to dwell in mortal clay; but it had changed its nature. We have said that
                        this young poet had never understood his calling, because he had not
                        comprehended man’s immortal destiny, wherein lies the solution of all this
                        life’s bewilderment, and he was still in the mist of his sorrowful
                        ignorance; but it often happens to those who have never filled the void of
                        their own spirit with the great name of truth, that when, for the first
                        time, a strong affection of earth comes swelling up into their soul, they
                        conceive that their whole being shall be content therewith, and that around
                        this alone, may revolve all their thoughts, and longings, and desires. The
                        conviction of this<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7183-196"/> error comes best and
                        soonest in the full accomplishment of their desires, for satiety is the
                        deepest test of the true value of enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the treasure is unattainable, however, it seems mostly to suffice for
                        the heart of man,—and it was so now with Arthur. He had never yet stilled
                        the raging fire of his ambitious yearnings, by giving the fruit of his great
                        gifts to the world, for he did not sufficiently love mankind either to
                        devote his genius to benefit them, or to gain their applause for himself;
                        but now at this time it seemed to him that he would readily employ all his
                        rare talent to conquer one gentle heart.</p>
                    <p>He had the consciousness of his own genius, as all must have who possess
                        it,—and at times the wild hope came across him that the young soul of
                        Millicent, which ever seemed to him limpid and clear as a stream at its
                        source, would so meet his own with its<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7183-197"/>
                        treasures of poetry, that she would overlook his unsightly appearance.
                        Millicent would have been overwhelmed with astonishment had she discovered
                        the nature of his feelings. In France she had been taught to look on
                        first‐cousins as brothers, and she had no intention of doing otherwise in
                        England. Even had this idea been removed, however, poor Arthur, with his
                        repulsive looks and his morbid gloomy disposition, would never have inspired
                        her with any other feeling than that of compassion.</p>
                    <p>Arthur now recalled her to a recollection of his presence, by telling her
                        that he was convinced her horse had cast a shoe, and that she had better
                        stop and have it ascertained. This was done, and his supposition was found
                        to be correct. She was obliged to dismount while the groom galloped off to a
                        blacksmith’s which was fortunately near, and the rest of the party assembled
                        round her. Aylmer suggested that they should all take<pb n="197"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-198"/> a walk until the horse was ready, but Anne and
                        Fanny exclaimed against this idea, bidding him look in what part of the
                        country they were before he proposed it.</p>
                    <p>In truth, Millicent and Aylmer had been talking too earnestly to observe the
                        scene through which they were passing,—they were now in the very midst of
                        the colliery district, surrounded on all sides by the miserable hovels in
                        which the miners dwelt. It was certainly a most uninviting spot,—those
                        cheerless, half‐ruined huts, rising but a little way above the black naked
                        ground, had every appearance of the most squalid wretchedness; whilst the
                        few ragged women and starved‐looking children who were crawling about, wore
                        the stamp of abject poverty in every feature.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was not surprised that the Miss Egertons did not choose to walk: he
                        wished as they did that they had stopped anywhere else. He had a horror of
                        suffering either in him‐<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7183-199"/> self or in
                        others,—he liked sunny landscapes and smiling faces, and he shrank from the
                        very thought of sorrow for himself, although as yet he had known little of
                        it. He was by no means an unfeeling man: on the contrary, there was much
                        depth and warmth in his character, but he felt, as many persons do with
                        regard to the awful mass of poverty which overwhelms this vast country, that
                        it was an evil quite beyond his reach, and therefore, since he could not
                        remedy it, he would avoid all occasions of making himself unhappy by
                        contemplating it. So thought and so acted the man under the influence of the
                        world’s schooling,—not so felt Millicent Grey, who was as yet guided solely
                        by natural impulse. She gazed round on the gloomy scene, with great
                        astonishment for, as we have said, she had never looked poverty in the face.
                        “What a dismal place this is!” she said; “surely it cannot be, that human
                        beings live in those wretched abodes?”</p>
                    <pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7183-200"/>
                    <p>“I fear they do,” said Aylmer. “It is sad to think what misery is around us,
                        but we cannot help it.”</p>
                    <p>“We cannot help it!” She hardly understood what he meant: some impulse seemed
                        to move her, and she walked towards the nearest hut,—Aylmer followed her. As
                        they approached, they could distinguish a low moaning sound proceeding from
                        within.</p>
                    <p>“Some one is in distress here,” exclaimed Millicent, and hastily pushing
                        aside the door which was swinging half off its hinges, she entered the
                        cottage. She found herself in a dark miserable room devoid of all furniture,
                        and containing only some heaps of straw, serving apparently as beds to the
                        wretched inmates. Close to the hearth, where not a spark of fire lingered
                        among the black cinders, a woman sat crouching, her face buried in her
                        hands, and her continual moaning seeming to indicate that she was in pain.
                        Two half‐naked children lay sleeping at her feet.<pb n="200"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-201"/> Millicent shivered as she cast a rapid glance on
                        the cheerless aspect of the place,—then going up to the woman, she laid her
                        hand softly on her shoulder, and asked if anything was the matter with her.
                        The poor creature looked up and gazed for a moment in her face, with a sort
                        of vacant astonishment, but soon resuming her former position, she began to
                        rock herself to and fro with many heavy sighs.</p>
                    <p>“Are you ill?” said Millicent, in a gentle voice.</p>
                    <p>“Ill enough,” replied the woman, with the sort of dogged sullenness which
                        almost invariably takes possession of the pauper, who has long ceased to
                        hope or expect relief.</p>
                    <p>“But then you surely have a doctor to attend you?—can he do you no good?”
                        said Millicent, who never supposed it possible that any one could have to
                        suffer, either morally or physically, without the means of relief.</p>
                    <pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7183-202"/>
                    <p>Again the woman lifted her head, and looked at her; she evidently thought
                        that the “lady” mocked her. Millicent repeated her question; a bitter smile
                        passed over the woman’s face,—“Oh, ay,—we’ve a doctor, sure enough,—he puts
                        us out of pain, any how: there’s my child, in the corner, see what he has
                        done for her.” She pointed to what Millicent had fancied was only a bundle
                        of rags: she now saw it was a tattered counterpane, covering a little child.
                        She went and lifted it up, but started back appalled and almost frightened;
                        the white rigid face which met her gaze, wore that expression of sternness
                        and of indomitable calm, which is so strangely sublime when stamped on an
                        infant brow. The majesty of death shone forth on the innocent countenance of
                        the pauper’s little child, and filled her soul with awe. She let the
                        covering fall over it with silent respect, and crept back to the poor
                        mother.</p>
                    <pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7183-203"/>
                    <p>“This is very sad; I feel so much for you; poor little child! How did you
                        lose it?”</p>
                    <p>“Do you mean, what was it killed my baby?” said the woman, not yet softened
                        by Millicent’s gentle sympathy. “You may know that soon enough: it was
                        starvation.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent actually screamed, “Starvation! Oh, you do not mean it. Oh how
                        dreadful! Surely it is not possible, and to think of that loaded table
                        yesterday! Oh, we did not know it,—we did not know it, indeed!” she
                        exclaimed, ready almost to fall on her knees, to ask forgiveness of this
                        woman, for the luxury in which she lived.</p>
                    <p>“Ay, like enough,” said the woman, bitterly; “what should such as you know of
                        us poor creatures!” And then passed through the mind of the starving pauper,
                        a vision of that awful history, on which the<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7183-204"
                        /> very souls of the poor do feed, finding therein a terrible consolation
                        and a savage hope. It was the parable of Lazarus and the beggar.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, but if we had known it, we never would have let this happen,” said
                        Millicent, trembling with agitation; “and at least you shall suffer no more
                        now,—take this, take all this,” and she emptied her purse into the woman’s
                        lap; “and I will bring you more, much more, to‐morrow,—everything you
                        want.</p>
                    <p>For the first time the woman seemed to feel that her visitor’s compassion was
                        genuine. She bowed her head, and burst into a passion of tears.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, my little baby, my poor, weeny baby! If I had had this, she need not
                        have died; it is too late for her—too late!”</p>
                    <p>“But not for the others,” said Millicent, eagerly. “Oh, take comfort; I will
                            never<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7183-205"/> let you want again. Indeed,
                        indeed, we could not have lived in all our comforts had we known your
                        suffering. But how was it? Surely some terrible misfortune caused it. What
                        can have made you so very poor?”</p>
                    <p>“It is nothing strange, anyhow,” said the woman; “many and many’s the one I
                        have seen worse off nor I have been. My husband’s a miner; from year’s end
                        to year’s end he never comes out of them black mines; it’s work, work, in
                        the dark, all day, and little pay; but it’s all one to me what he gets, I
                        never sees a penny of it. He’s taken to drinking, that he may drive out
                        care, and the parish won’t allow us nothing so long as he is in work—so here
                        we may sit and starve.”</p>
                    <p>“It is a most extraordinary case,” said Millicent, “I never heard anything so
                        sad. How strange that your condition was not known.”</p>

                    <p>The woman looked surprised; she well knew there was nothing uncommon in her
                        case.</p>
                    <p>“Well, my lady, indeed it’s not me only; there’s scarce a family in the place
                        that’s not as bad off nearly. I will speak up for them, poor creatures, for
                        they have done what they could for me: many a time they’ve given me a bit of
                        bread when not another soul’s come a‐nigh me.”</p>
                    <p>“Every family in the place as wretched!”</p>
                    <p>Millicent felt her brain almost reeling; she could not conceive the
                        possibility of so many human beings in want of the necessaries of life
                        within a few miles of those who were plunged in its luxuries; it was the
                        horror of the contrast that overcame her. For the first time the great
                        problem of want and superfluity was before her; to think of Rookcliffe and
                        Milton Lodge, and half‐a‐dozen similar houses not five miles distant, with
                        their abundance, their<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7183-207"/> comforts, their
                        elegancies—and then these damp, naked walls, that child dead of hunger, that
                        mother, sullen, hardened, mistrustful, losing the very woman’s heart within
                        her, because of her unpitied anguish, Millicent stood with flushed cheek and
                        trembling hands thinking on these things: the voice of Aylmer roused her—he
                        had remained at the door watching her, and it interested him to see how
                        those social evils, which have grown old and hackneyed amongst us, struck
                        that fresh, penetrating mind, so clear‐sighted and so full of depth, even
                        whilst ignorant of the commonest truths of daily life. He now told her, for
                        the second time, that her horse was ready, and her cousins impatient to
                        return home. She started, and, telling the woman she would send to her next
                        day, abruptly left the hut. Here she paused, and, looking with a dismayed
                        and anxious glance to the oilier cottages, she exclaimed:—</p>
                    <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7183-208"/>
                    <p>“We cannot go home yet; I must go into those houses, and tell them we will
                        help them. She told me they were all equally wretched—starving!”</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense, Millicent!” exclaimed Anne, “you can’t be going into those hovels
                        just now. If the people are in want, papa will send to relieve them—but I’ve
                        no doubt they are imposing on you.”</p>
                    <p>“At all events, you really must not go,” said Charles; “you are by no means
                        the proper person for such a task. You don’t understand these things, my
                        dear little cousin, or they would not astonish you so much; there must be
                        beggars everywhere, and we cannot help them all.”</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was pained by her look of distress as her cousins spoke, and he said
                        to her, in a low voice:</p>
                    <p>“It is really better you should not go now, but I will come here to‐morrow
                        and do all and everything you could wish.”</p>
                    <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7183-209"/>
                    <p>Millicent thanked him warmly, and at once mounted without another word. She
                        rode on in front with Aylmer, for Arthur seemed anxious this time not to
                        join them, and for a few minutes both were silent; at length, she turned to
                        him with a look of deep agitation.</p>
                    <p>“Tell me,” she said, “in one word, is it a common spectacle which I have this
                        day seen?—is it one isolated case; or has England many such?”</p>
                    <p>“Many thousands,” replied Aylmer. “It is best, in my opinion, not to know the
                        fearful extent of the misery we cannot relieve; but if you insist on the
                        plain truth, I must tell it. What you have seen is indeed a sight too sadly
                        universal, and, in fact, what we witnessed to‐day is nothing compared with
                        the awful amount of want and wretchedness which prevail in London and the
                        great manufacturing towns.”</p>
                    <p>She could not speak to answer him:<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7183-210"/> we are
                        too familiar with the great truth his words had conveyed, to conceive how
                        appalling such a statement was, to one who had never dreamt of such things
                        before.</p>
                    <p>Heavily did the first knowledge of the great dark tragedy for ever enacted by
                        the poor, come over that young spirit. The sense of her own utter
                        helplessness became insupportable: she bowed her face on her hands and wept
                        aloud. Aylmer felt a pang of remorse at sight of those pure teams falling
                        for the sorrows of others. How far gone was the time when he could so have
                        mourned with unselfish pity? Truly, had there ever been such a time for him?
                        So early had the natural sympathies, the first quick impulses been deadened
                        by habit and education, chilled by custom and experience; he felt that he
                        was looking on the fresh dews that well forth only, in the spring and
                        morning of<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7183-211"/> the heart, and the sight
                        inspired him with an involuntary reverence.</p>
                    <p>Millicent was ashamed of her emotion, and she soon conquered it.</p>
                    <p>“It is the terrible, the unnatural contrast between our own condition, and
                        that of these hapless beings, which overpowers me so much; if all suffered
                        alike,—if such were the destiny of man, then all might submit and endure
                        with faith and patience; but that some should have, not abundance only, but
                        a hundred fold more than they can use, not personal luxuries alone, but the
                        most costly ornaments to the rich homes in which they dwell, to the very
                        floors on which they tread,—and others, meanwhile, perish, actually perish
                        in cold and hunger; it is this that seems to me so appalling,—how can we
                        dare to live as we do?”</p>
                    <p>“But, my dear Miss Grey,” said Aylmer, soothingly, for he saw she was
                        strongly excited, “you must reflect that you are now<pb n="211"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-212"/> for the first time looking on that great national
                        and social evil, which occupies the whole thoughts and attention of
                        legislators and political economists. You have been laying bare the most
                        deep wound which the best and wisest of men so long have sought in vain to
                        heal. All see the evil, all deplore it,—but who shall suggest a remedy? It
                        seems to be an imperative law of nature that these widely‐contrasted
                        positions should exist?”</p>
                    <p>“Doubtless,” exclaimed Millicent, “I know that equality is as impossible as
                        it is undesirable. I have discovered that, in reading history. I remember to
                        have noted in the records of nations how, when rank was abolished, the
                        aristocracy of talent or of power straightway took its place. No! ignorant
                        as I feel myself, I have read enough to have imbibed the most deep‐rooted
                        horror for all leveling and republican principles. The distinction of rank
                        and station<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7183-213"/> is clearly a divine as well as
                        a necessary principle, and even for the sake of the lower classes one would
                        not have it otherwise. We should do a great evil, I am sure, if we sought to
                        change the condition of the merry French peasant, or the contented English
                        labourer. I went with Sophia to one of their cottages yesterday, and I was
                        so charmed with the scene,—but I did not think there were any much poorer
                        than these. I never dreamt of people actually starving; and it is the
                        violent extreme of the contrast between rich and poor which strikes me so
                        painfully; the palace‐houses, and the wealth expended, on a thousand costly
                        frivolities which have not even an intrinsic value, (being altogether
                        useless; the devices of fashion for the employment of superfluous riches,)
                        and then the utter destitution with its daily, hourly agony. Many grades in
                        our social system there must and ought to be, but surely it is a fearful
                            thing<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7183-214"/> that there should be within a
                        few yards of each other men revelling even to satiety in the full sunshine
                        blaze of prosperity, and others lost in the darkest depths of misery, barren
                        even of hope?”</p>
                    <p>“No doubt it is a fearful thing, and you cannot suppose you are the first to
                        have discovered it. Believe me, the noblest intellects in our own land have
                        been devoted to the task of seeking a remedy for it,—but they have found
                        none as yet any more than you could; it is an evil, passing man’s power to
                        compass.”</p>
                    <p>“But that is surely no reason why we should be indifferent to it,” said
                        Millicent very gently; “I think it is taking a dreary and enervating view of
                        the case to say that because we cannot remedy it, we will not think of it at
                        all. I see your remark conveyed to me a strong reproof for my presumption in
                        attempting to discuss such a deep subject, and certainly it was deserved,<pb
                            n="214" xml:id="VAB7183-215"/> and would be more so, if I really
                        pretended to give an opinion on matters with which women have nothing to do,
                        and which ought to occupy the wise heads of statesmen only,—and indeed I do
                        not even know what is meant by political economy. But, Mr. Aylmer, my eyes
                        have looked on the face of a fellow creature who died of starvation, and I
                        think had even the veriest child stood and gazed on such a sight, it would
                        have asked if there was no remedy, and would have thought upon the
                        matter.”</p>
                    <p>“Unquestionably,” said Aylmer, “they are thoughts which force themselves on
                        every mind, and I can perfectly understand, after the hermit‐life you have
                        led, that these great evils strike you in a new and appalling light, which
                        we who are too much accustomed to them, could not conceive. But still I can
                        but repeat what I said before,—the deadly wound is there, but who shall find
                        the soothing balm wherewith to heal it?”</p>
                    <pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7183-216"/>
                    <p>“I am very fond of Utopia,” said Millicent, suddenly turning her bright face
                        to him, “I like wandering there in visions which, though I well how they can
                        never he realized, still do one’s heart good to fancy they warm one into
                        hope. Now my Utopia for the poor, would be, that each man to whom is given
                        as his station, the advantages of material and intellectual wealth, should
                        instead of living for himself, live for those, his sorrowing brethren, and
                        devote his life’s energy to ameliorate their condition,—if all did this,
                        might not their universal efforts compass, so far as the world’s predestined
                        fate permits, a universal evil?”</p>
                    <p>“Utopia, indeed,” said Aylmer smiling, but he had not time to add more, for
                        Charles rode up at that moment.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent,” he said, “I can stand this no longer; ever since we had the
                        misfortune to let you go into that cottage you have had<pb n="216"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-217"/> an expression on your face, which has chilled me,
                        as if we were in the month of December. Pray restore us to that very Italian
                        summer which you brought with you into the dull old house at Rookcliffe. You
                        introduced yourself among us as a most merry and amusing companion, and
                        really you will have gained all our hearts on false pretences if you assume
                        any other character now.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent saw that Charles was talking much more earnestly than was his wont,
                        and as her spirits were far too light and elastic to remain long depressed,
                        she readily accepted his challenge, and made the old woods ring with her
                        clear merry laugh, as they rode homewards.</p>

                        desponding humour, yet she could not forget the scene she had witnessed, and
                        when the family assembled before dinner, she began describing it to her
                        uncle as he stood with his capacious person benevolently protecting the fire
                        from any intrusive approaches.</p>
                    <p>“Well, my dear,” he answered, “this is no doubt very sad, but you would find
                        the same poverty in many parts of the kingdom;<pb n="218"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-219"/> these things really cannot be helped. I was quite
                        aware that there was much wretchedness in the mining district, where you
                        unfortunately went to‐day; but it is far beyond the power of any single
                        individual or party of individuals to relieve it; you may rest assured,
                        Millicent, that I would willingly do what I could for them.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent had a spice of mischief in her disposition, and since her residence
                        in England, she had often found no small amusement in reducing the
                        respectable theories which pervade our atmosphere, to the test of
                        practice.</p>
                    <p>“I am sure you would, dear uncle, you would do all you could for these
                        starving people, even though it involved a little self‐sacrifice, would you
                        not?”</p>
                    <p>“I trust, Millicent, when you have lived sometime longer in this house, you
                        will not require to ask such a question: you will then learn that those who
                        feel the most, say the<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7183-220"/> least.”—“And do the

                    <p>“I beg that you will not suppose that you are the only person who deplores
                        the condition of these paupers,” continued Egerton, with no small testiness;
                        “the Egertons, from time immemorial, have laboured for the good of their
                        tenantry.” (“And the improvement of their lands,” continued Charles, with
                        his running accompaniment,) “And that in a manner which would prove to you
                        that they do not shrink from self‐sacrifice.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, I am sure of it,” said Millicent, “and in this instance also, as well as
                        in others.”</p>
                    <p>“Certainly, if there were anything to done, but we have often talked it over

                        boldness, but even for this affair—I have an idea—”</p>
                    <p>She hesitated, and laughed at what she inwardly qualified as her own cool
                        presumption.</p>
                    <p>“Let us have it, my dear,” said Mr. Egerton, condescendingly patting her
                        shoulder. “Curious results have often arisen,” he continued, addressing his
                        wife, “from the innocent remarks of children and young persons; their very
                        ignorance causes them to take such novel views of the subject as often
                        produce very valuable suggestions.”</p>
                    <p>“I wonder whose remarks are innocent now,” murmured Charles, as he looked at
                        the contrast between his father’s bland and stolid countenance, where beamed
                        not a ray of any fire more ethereal than that at which he was slowly
                        roasting, and Millicent’s intelligent face, her clear eyes sparkling with
                        all the rigour of a young, fresh intellect.</p>
                    <pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7183-222"/>
                    <p>“Then I have leave to say anything I please, however presumptuous?” asked
                        she.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Egerton waved his hand encouragingly.</p>
                    <p>“Pray tell me, then, supposing that two thousand pounds could be yearly
                        distributed for the support of the miners’ families, or for increasing the
                        pay of the men themselves, to such an amount as should prevent the
                        possibility of want for their children, would it not go far to relieve the
                        distress even of that whole district?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course it would, any child might know that; but where is such a sum to
                        come from?”</p>
                    <p>Millicent cast a sly glance at the old gentleman’s pockets, which suddenly
                        enlightened Charles as to the nature of her ideas on the subject; she took
                        care, however, that her words should not seem quite so crude as were her
                        thoughts.</p>
                    <pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7183-223"/>
                    <p>“Why you know, uncle, you told me when you were describing many of the
                        English customs to me, that an establishment like yours could not be kept up
                        under three thousand a‐year, and that the rest of your income went to the
                        improvement of your estate.”</p>
                    <p>“Very true.” Mr. Egerton began to look uneasy.</p>
                    <p>“Then, if all persons situated like yourself were to feel that they would
                        like to make any sacrifice to save the starving people, you might all
                        determine to give up, at least, a whole two thousand a‐year to them; and it
                        could be easily done by changing the style of living entirely, and reducing
                        the family expenses to somewhere about eight hundred a‐year. It would be
                        quite riches, you know, in comparison to what half the population have.”</p>
                    <p>“Easily done!—riches!” Mr. Egerton was so astonished that he could only
                        ejaculate a<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7183-224"/> few fragmentary, portions of
                        his great indignation.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” we should all have to give up our comforts, of course—carriages,
                        horses, all that; but then what could be compared to the luxury of knowing
                        that never again should any one die of starvation so near; and we might be
                        immensely happy and comfortable on the income you still would have left. We
                        should live in a very different way, and being so large a family, perhaps we
                        should not have much more than the necessaries of life; but these
                        necessaries would be shared by hundreds of families, who have them not at
                        all just now.”</p>
                    <p>“Shared. indeed!” said Mr. Egerton<corr>.</corr></p>
                    <p>“It might not be possible to live at Rookcliffe on that pittance,” continued
                        Millicent, warming with her subject, “but as it is not an old family place;
                        and only lately bought by yourself, you could complete the good work<pb
                            n="224" xml:id="VAB7183-225"/> by selling it, and so gaining another
                        enormous sum for the poor.”</p>
                    <p>“Now, thanks to my good fortune, the place is entailed,” muttered
                        Charles.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, you are talking the most consummate nonsense,” suddenly shouted
                        her uncle, having recovered his voice and his breath, which had been fairly
                        taken away by her unexpected proposal. “You don’t know what you are saying,
                        and I wish to goodness you would keep quiet,—I never heard such arrant folly
                        in my life.” Millicent was frightened into silence fast enough by this
                        tremendous burst of indignation, and she retreated behind her cousins, who
                        were all laughing heartily.</p>
                    <p>“I’ve one comfort,” said Mr. Egerton, beginning to cool down, and addressing
                        his wife, who was the picture of rigid disapprobation, “that mad girl’s own
                        fortune is safe in my hands till she is of age, and I<pb n="225"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-226"/> hope by that time we may find some sensible man
                        to take care of it for her.” Mrs. Egerton shook her head ominously, and they
                        all felt relieved when dinner was announced.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Aylmer dined with them next day, and Millicent found that he had amply
                        fulfilled his promise with respect to the poor people she had seen. He had
                        awakened Colonel Bentley’s compassion for them, who, like many other good
                        people, was most liberal whenever his attention was drawn to the subject,
                        but who never thought it could be at all necessary for him to rise out of
                        his usual apathetic indifference unless an actual appeal were made to him.
                        His nephew had, however, spent the day among the miners, and he brought
                        Millicent such a report of the relief they were to receive, as filled her
                        with gratitude towards him.</p>
                    <p>The party at Rookcliffe was further<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7183-227"/>
                        enlivened on this day by the curate of the parish and his pretty wife. He
                        was a very comfortable curate indeed. His good fortune had procured for him
                        in his present subordinate position that prosperous ease, which is the usual
                        perquisite of rectors only. Being very good looking and of pleasant manners,
                        he had won for his companion not only a handsome and elegant woman, but an
                        heiress to boot, through which means he was now enabled to live in a
                        splendid house, whose luxurious apartments it must have been rather
                        difficult to quit, on the cold nights when the sick people sent for him. He
                        was a very cheerful young man; just the sort of person to swell the number
                        of those clerical Bluebeards, who are perpetually rising, as phœnix
                        bridegrooms, from the ashes of the widower state, and of whom England
                        possesses so many, happy in the affections of their third or fourth wife. He
                        had two great leading<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7183-228"/> principles, which
                        chiefly governed his existence; the first was a strong abhorrence and
                        avoidance of non‐essentials, of which he had a very large list, and an
                        equally great dislike to what he termed “morbidness,” under which head he
                        qualified all acute feeling, sensitiveness, and fervour, whether in matters
                        theological or domestic. There were also two or three young ladies of that
                        species, who love to look at other young ladies through their eye‐glasses,
                        and whose object is to exalt themselves, by an exclusiveness, which shuts
                        out from the charity of their sympathy, all but the very few who have
                        attained the fashionable nonchalance that professes to require none of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Millicent found herself seated between Charles Egerton and the curate, with
                        Aylmer sufficiently near to join in the conversation. Charles had been
                        talking with him, of his extreme impatience for the arrival of the hunting
                        season, which was in his estimation<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7183-229"/> the
                        only period of the year worth living for.</p>
                    <p>“That is a noble sight you have yet to see, Miss Grey,” said the curate; “of
                        course you have never witnessed an English fox‐hunt,—I quite envy you the
                        first impression, you will be so delighted.”</p>
                    <p>“Don’t calculate on Miss Grey being delighted with anything that delights
                        other people, my dear Reverendissimo,” said Charles. “With all due respect,
                        Millicent, I may be allowed to mention, that your tastes and ideas are
                        slightly peculiar. I have no doubt, if you would favour us now with your
                        views on fox‐hunting, you would prove to us that we had been labouring under
                        some great mistake respecting it.”</p>
                    <p>“You really make me feel,” said Millicent, laughing, “as if I had some mental
                            <emph>peculiarity</emph>, which deserves a less gentle name; but what
                        can I do? I come to England, and I look straight at everything,<pb n="229"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-230"/> and I see what it is, and then, if you ask me, I
                        must tell you. One can’t help distinguishing between black and white; if it
                        is black I must say so.”</p>
                    <p>“Exactly; but that is just the thing. All our innocent customs seem to you so
                        very black,” replied Charles. “Pray tell us now, however, what you think of
                        hunting. Where is our error? Perhaps it is not a fox we run after at
                        all.”</p>
                    <p>“Very true,” said Millicent, composedly, “it is not the fox, it is his tail,
                        and that is just what surprises me,—to think of ever so many intellectual
                        men; all very learned, having had classical educations and the highest grade
                        of instruction, giving themselves so much trouble and expense, and putting
                        themselves into a violent heat, all for the sake of getting the simple tail
                        of a fox.”</p>
                    <p>“But we don’t call it a tail,” exclaimed Charles, “it is the brush.”</p>
                    <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7183-231"/>
                    <p>“You can call it what you like, but it is the tail all the same, you know,
                        neither the fox himself nor anybody else can doubt that; and I must say, few
                        things astonish me more than the extraordinary love you all seem to have for
                        it. You keep up horses and hounds at an enormous expense; you have a whole
                        establishment for the purpose, and actually a sort of uniform, as if you
                        were going to conquer an army instead of gaining only a wretched little
                        tail. You long for the hunting season all the year round, and then, when the
                        happy time does come, you all assemble together, ever so many full‐grown
                        men, in the pride of your intellect and strength, and you ride off at the
                        risk of your lives, all struggling who is to gain the precious piece of
                        goods, and every one hating the man who gets it, when he rides back in
                        triumph with his tail.”</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, you are really too absurd,” said Charles. “it is not the brush,
                        or the<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7183-232"/> tail as you will persist in calling
                        it, that is our object in hunting,—we only take it as a proof that we came
                        in at the death. It is the excitement and amusement of the chase that we
                        like.”</p>
                    <p>“The amusement of seeing a fox die,—of watching it straining and panting,
                        with its poor heart bursting, as they say it does sometimes, in the
                        effort,—flying in the torture of pursuit, with the open‐mouthed dogs at its
                        heels, making the most incredible exertions to escape, and then sinking
                        exhausted and quivering, to feel the teeth of the hound in its throat. No, I
                        would rather think it was the love of the tail, than believe that men of
                        feeling and mind should make their pleasure in the death‐agonies of poor
                        helpless animal?</p>
                    <p>“But, Millicent, you do use such extraordinary terms. It is not the actual
                        pleasure of seeing the fox die, though they do a great deal of mischief, and
                        must be destroyed, but<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7183-233"/> it is the fine
                        bracing exercise, and the opportunity of trying one’s courage, that is
                        really of use to the health and the mind as well.”</p>
                    <p>“If the foxes must be destroyed, let the farmers destroy them, or the
                        butchers who perform the same office for the oxen and sheep. You never think
                        of kindly relieving <emph>them</emph> of their task, although I don’t in the
                        least see why you should not just as well assemble to kill the mutton and
                        beef. As to exercise, you can gallop on horseback quite as fast without
                        having a fox in an agony running before you; and for the display, or the
                        testing of valour, considering that this world, is very full of such things,
                        as the oppression of the helpless, and the wronging of the innocent, I think
                        some nobler means might be found for the trial of your courage.”</p>
                    <p>“Miss Grey, it seems extraordinary to hear you talking, against what has
                        always been considered quite an honour to England<pb n="233"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-234"/> and peculiar to the country, such a fine manly
                        sport,” said the curate.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot think it manly to take a pleasure in the torture of a poor dumb
                        victim, and that any one should find sport in it is beyond my conception.
                        No, Charles, I am certain if you analyze the especial charm of fox‐hunting,
                        you will find it is the intrinsic value of the tail, unless, as I said
                        before, you choose to admit that it is the delight of seeing the unhappy
                        brute killed before your eyes,—in which case if humanity has fallen thus
                        far, the sooner they give up fostering so cruel a taste the better, to my
                        mind.”</p>
                    <p>“Only you must remember, Miss Grey,” said Aylmer, “that the same argument
                        applies to all field‐sports; shooting, and fishing, and everything of the
                        kind.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, I can only say of these as of fox hunting, I do think it degrading to
                        man that he should find his pleasure and amusement, in the pain of any
                        created thing.<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7183-235"/> Since they must be put to
                        death that they may serve as food, let it be done by hired people, as of
                        necessity; but do not let their expiring struggles form the systematic
                        delight of a set of amateur butchers. If only each one of them would make
                        their chosen pursuit in the relief of pain, and the giving of happiness to
                        others, instead of this contrary principle, what a strange bright world this
                        soon might be made.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, Miss Millicent, I declare I have you there!” exclaimed Charles. “You
                        do give a great pleasure to others in hunting; for the hounds like it
                        extremely: they take a real pleasure in it.”</p>
                    <p>“Then, do you mean me to suppose that Englishmen are so very tender‐hearted,
                        and so considerate of the feelings of the lower animals, that they actually
                        take all this trouble, and devote themselves, at the risk of their lives,
                        for the sole purpose of pleasing their dogs? How extraordinarily kind!<pb
                            n="235" xml:id="VAB7183-236"/> but if their motives are so very
                        disinterested, it strikes me that there is a slight error in their judgment,
                        for of course you would not wish to give a preference, in your sympathy to
                        any one species of the brute creation in particular: so that whilst you are
                        carefully providing for canine gratification, you overlook altogether, the
                        necessity of consulting the feelings of the fox himself.”</p>
                    <p>“There is no use in arguing with you, most pertinacious cousin,” said
                        Charles, “but really it is incredible that you should composedly give forth
                        a sweeping condemnation of all field sports, the old well‐established
                        amusements of England.”</p>
                    <p>“You must lay all the blame on my defective education,” said Millicent,
                        laughing. “I am quite aware that I have never learned my catechism.”</p>
                    <p>“Come, that is in my province, Miss Grey,” said the curate; “I will undertake
                        you as a pupil.”</p>
                    <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7183-237"/>
                    <p>“Oh, no, I do not mean what you would be bound to teach me,” said Millicent.
                        “I mean that theoretic catechism, unacknowledged but universally learned,
                        which teaches the popular and received meaning of those things that are not
                        destined to be called by their right names. It seems to me that, in this
                        country, every one is duly instructed in a set of useful principles—little
                        systems for the rule of social life, which are all ticketed and labeled with
                        the finest possible sounding names, and these, when once impressed upon the
                        young mind, can never again be separated from the fallacy they protect. I
                        dare say the children have picture‐books full of practical illustrations,
                        and their nurses show them two men shooting at each other, and say, ‘Now, my
                        dear, this is honour;’ (for you call a duel the vindication of your honour,
                        don’t you?) and a gentleman watching the worrying of a fox, Charles, and
                        say, ‘This is a<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7183-238"/> healthy amusement for mind
                        and body,’ with a variety of other scenes, representing prudence, and proper
                        pride, and self‐respect, and charity which begins and finishes at home. Now,
                        you see, never having learned these technical terms, all things present
                        themselves to me in their natural true form, without any disguise whatever,
                        and of course I talk of them as I see them; but now, I have been quite
                        impertinent enough for one day, so I shall not speak another word; but I
                        mean to listen to that grave discussion, which my uncle is holding with the
                        old lady, in the purple face and turban.”</p>
                    <p>Aylmer brought Millicent a most pressing request from Mrs. Hartley and her
                        brother, that she would spend the following day with them, to which she
                        willingly agreed; and from that time forward, it became a sort of tacit
                        arrangement that she should be with them every day when it was possible for
                        her to walk to Milton Lodge.</p>

                    <p><hi>THREE</hi> months had passed away: autumn had come with its sighing
                        winds, so like the voice of the decaying year lamenting its departed
                        brightness; and, outwardly, there seemed little more of change, in the
                        inhabitants of Rookcliffe, than in the old walls themselves. And, yet, if we
                        had power to see it, strange wild dramas are enacted day by day in the
                        silent souls of those around us; they walk beside us unchanged in aspect,
                        and we dream not of the dark shadows that<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7183-240"/>
                        may be stealing over the heart we still believe so light and joyous; we
                        fancy that to be reserve which is the instinct of deep feeling; and that
                        bitter pride, which folds over deep gnawing wounds the quiet hands that
                        tremble not, to be the calm of a contented mind, and yet there may be
                        working in that tranquil breast, the seeds of mortal anguish which have
                        driven many to insanity or death. Outwardly, no change at Rookcliffe, but
                        for two of those who dwelt beneath its roof, it was as though the earth on
                        which their youthful steps had trodden, with all its lights and shadows, its
                        joys and sorrows, had passed away for ever, and there was a new world with a
                        new state of existence. Yet, not in the same region were these spirits
                        wandering now. When the winds of destiny are unbound from their hid cavern,
                        and set forth on their appointed mission, the same blast which sweeps away
                        the hopes from the soul of one, like withered<pb n="240"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-241"/> leaves from a tree, bears the seeds of sweet
                        flowers to the heart of another, where they germinate and flourish to fill
                        the whole being with fragrance. It was so with Millicent and Arthur. The one
                        was in a land of light and gladness now, where the sun of hope had risen,
                        and shone unsetting, so that there was no night there; and the whole air was
                        filled with melody, whose music was from one voice alone, and all things
                        were made lovely, with the presence of that perfect beauty, which is ever in
                        the face of one beloved.</p>
                    <p>And the other was far away, in a chill and frozen region, where the sun of
                        hope had sunk, as beneath the deep waters of despair, so that there was no
                        day there, and no melody, because the voice that made sweet music gave all
                        its gentle tones unto another, and no beauty, because the face beloved, was
                        radiant only with the joy, that came from other love than his.</p>
                    <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7183-242"/>
                    <p>It may be, that if some observed, how the tread of Arthur Egerton, was slower
                        and heavier than of old, and his eyes dim, as though, not sleep alone, but
                        dreams, had fled from him, they thought the chill weather, and the gloom of
                        decaying nature subdued the poet’s fiery soul; but they never dreamt that
                        these were tokens of the cold dead winter of the heart, where all the sweet
                        blossoms of his spring of hope, lay mouldering away, blasted by the freezing
                        winds of disappointment; and little did they think, when calmly he moved
                        amongst them, that he had passed through that convulsion of the mind, which
                        is like to the shock of death itself, for it is the rending away of the very
                        life hope, from the being that seems to fall a dull inert mass of clay
                        without it.</p>
                    <p>But if they noted the change that had passed on Millicent Grey, they could,
                        in some sense, understand it; for they knew<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7183-243"
                        /> that she was the promised wife of Stephen Aylmer. Great was the change,
                        in truth, that had come upon her,—none greater in the phases of a purely
                        earthly existence,—it was as though a new being had been given to her, for
                        it was life, animated by a new principle.</p>
                    <p>She had done that thing, the most perilous, the most awful which any can do
                        in this mere mortal life. She had delivered up her whole heart and soul to
                        the love of one human idol. We have seen how her young, ardent spirit had
                        flown forth into life, to seek that object for its worship, which, exiled
                        from its own true home by ignorance and misconception, it sought in earth
                        alone; and how she was led to the belief, that the intense indefinite
                        longing, the aching void of her soul could, only find a rest in one deep
                        human affection,—in the entire devotion of her life to the happiness of
                        another. Before ever she had learnt to<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7183-244"/>
                        feel, she already held in theory, what was the natural impulse of her
                        woman’s heart.</p>
                    <p>And now, with her, that surrender of every faculty of the being, to one
                        absorbing thought, was entire; for she had no ties of blood, no childhood’s
                        affection to draw her heart’s deep tenderness in other channels, nor had she
                        ever yet effected an entrance into that bright and holy life, within whose
                        pure atmosphere no god of dust and clay can find a throne.</p>
                    <p>Once in a life‐time, only, is such an affection felt, as that which bound
                        Millicent Grey to Stephen Aylmer. All was bright and prosperous around her
                        now; a few short months, as she believed, would see her linked to him by
                        holiest ties; yet not because of present hope and joy, was this deep,
                        earnest friendship so intense. If in the future, storms and clouds should
                        come upon the sunshine of her happiness,—if even he who was her idol, should
                            by<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7183-245"/> unworthy deeds, or chilled
                        affection, fall from the high pedestal where she had placed him in her great
                        esteem, it could not change or lessen her attachment for him. It seemed to
                        have taken root in the very principle of life itself, and with the life
                        alone could now expire.</p>
                    <p>And she was changed. The fierce independence of mind, the quick energetic
                        scrutiny of life, were over. Much more thoughtful, more still and silent;
                        every look and tone told how her spirit was subdued to his. She thought as
                        he thought, loved what he loved, and could have even learned to hate what he
                        hated. Her eyes no longer wandered restlessly, seeking a hope in life, but
                        ever rested on him, in whom all joys were bound up; her feet no longer
                        strayed, searching a path that should give the promise of an aim on earth,
                        but meekly journeyed where he trod, content to make it her life’s mission,
                            to<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7183-246"/> clear away the stones and thorns
                        before steps.</p>
                    <p>And Stephen Aylmer?—was she all in all to him, as he to her? No one ever made
                        a plot so palpably manifest, or flattered himself that he concealed it so
                        ably, as did Colonel Bentley, when, having set his heart on effecting a
                        marriage between Aylmer and his favourite Millicent, he commenced, by a
                        series of the most glaring manœuvres, the task of accomplishing his purpose.
                        Colonel Bentley was a singular old man; if once an idea took possession of
                        him, however unexpectedly or wildly, it was utterly impossible for himself
                        or others to eradicate it. Already when he quitted Millicent, at the Tower
                        Stairs, on their arrival, had he made up his mind that she was the very
                        person he desired to be the wife of his favourite nephew, as well as a
                        satisfactory niece to himself, and he never from that moment lost sight of
                        his object. For this reason he came to Milton<pb n="246"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-247"/> Lodge—for this reason he monopolized Millicent’s
                        society, and while his wish and his purpose strengthened every day, he
                        failed not to give Stephen the strongest possible intimations that if his
                        will were thwarted on this point, he might go so far as to transfer his
                        property from so refractory an individual to the young girl herself.</p>
                    <p>But Aylmer had no desire to disappoint his uncle’s wishes, if by any means he
                        could accommodate himself to them, and this, after a short acquaintance with
                        Millicent, he found himself willing to do. He had not the slightest
                        attachment for her—he never yet had felt a strong affection for any one, and
                        she had failed to effect any change in this respect. He had, in fact, come
                        to the conclusion that he never was to find his ideal, or feel deeply for
                        any living being. But it was impossible to know Millicent Grey, so frank, so
                        generous, so warm‐hearted, without loving her in some degree; and he did
                        like her, quite well enough<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7183-248"/> to make her
                        his life’s companion, with a hearty good will. He did not attempt to conceal
                        from himself, that she was not in the least, what he had always resolved,
                        his wife should be. His ideal had ever been one of surpassing beauty; for,
                        as we have said elsewhere, he worshipped the Beautiful with all the fervency
                        and devotion which men offer to the self‐elected gods to whom they cause
                        their souls to bow, in order to satisfy the craving of their nature for
                        adoration; and the sweet face of Millicent Grey had none of that perfection
                        or symmetry which would win the artist’s heart, although it was very
                        pleasing from its charming expression, especially of late, when softened by
                        the reflection of the deep, generous tenderness that filled her heart.</p>
                    <p>In short, it had not been given to her to call to life the strong affections
                        that lay hid in the heart of that proud man; waiting only, till the crisis
                        of his destiny, to rise up<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7183-249"/> like billows
                        from the ocean of deceitful calm, and swell out in their ungovernable might,
                        till they well nigh made shipwreck of his soul, Aylmer was little aware of
                        the intense power of attachment, which lurked in his own nature, or, if he
                        were, he never expected to meet any one who would call it forth; and
                        meanwhile he was well content to secure to himself, so faithful and devoted
                        a companion, as he saw that Millicent would be to him. It was a pleasant
                        thing to think that this pure, boundless love would breathe such warmth into
                        his whole life—that he would be ministered unto day by day with such earnest
                        watchful care.</p>
                    <p>He could not but love her too, in some degree, now that the near approach of
                        the time fixed for their marriage had put an end to reserve between them,
                        and that he saw how generously and devotedly her whole heart was given to
                        him. His warm sympathy for the poor, and active exertions on<pb n="249"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-250"/> their behalf, had been the first things which had
                        caused her to distinguish him, from all around her, and her vivid
                        imagination had soon invested him with an ideal character of almost perfect
                        moral beauty, to which his many really good qualities gave a strong
                        semblance of reality; and now, she had not an idea how poor was the return
                        he made her for the vast wealth, of the whole deathless affection she had
                        bestowed upon him; or if at times she was constrained to feel how she was
                        but a very small part in his existence—whilst his own image had shut out the
                        world for her, she conceived it but the natural result of the great
                        superiority, which she was convinced he possessed over herself.</p>
                    <p>She felt that he had given her the highest proof of esteem, in choosing her
                        from all the world, to be his first and best friend until death, and she
                        asked no more, since this gave her a right to minister even to his faintest
                        wish.</p>
                    <pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7183-251"/>
                    <p>Moreover, her attachment had that entire disinterestedness, which is inherent
                        to the very nature of all deep and intense affection. She no longer thought
                        of herself at all, save as the privileged guardian of his existence on
                        earth; nor had she now any wish, or hope, or object, except his happiness.
                        This was the star of her life, which was to guide her every thought, and
                        word, and deed,—it was the desire of her heart, the one absorbing thought of
                        her soul; his happiness, not her own; nor yet his only, as united to hers,
                        but his, by any means in which it could be procured for him, either by the
                        offering of her whole life’s devotion with him, or the sacrifice of her
                        whole life’s joy without him.</p>
                    <p>They stood together now, side by side, on a rising ground, within the park,
                        at Rookcliffe, where they had been walking. They were returning home, and
                        paused here, to look at the fair, peaceful scene that<pb n="251"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-252"/> was spread out before them, in the faint light of
                        the autumn evening. He looked with his free, proud glance, on the
                        landscape,—but she, on him, with a timid, wistful gaze in her earnest eyes,
                        as though the poor, trembling soul within her were whispering, “I have done
                        a fearful thing, I have given you my whole existence, my whole capacity for
                        happiness,—I have given you my life. Oh, what will you make of it? Will you
                        deal tenderly with it, and be merciful to it,—will you fill it with light
                        and joy, as you may do so easily, by a little loving kindness, or will you
                        be rude and careless with it, and cast it from you, to perish in some desert
                        waste?”</p>
                    <p>It might have been the melancholy season of the year, the sight of nature in
                        her mourning garments, as though it were her time of widowhood for the
                        summer,—the whisperings of decay and death that went forth in the rustle of
                        the falling leaves, and<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7183-253"/> the rough
                        wantoning of the wind with the naked branches,—but certain it is, the heart
                        of Millicent was full of a strange terror, and a sad foreboding. She crept
                        close to the side of Aylmer,—he looked round kindly at her.</p>
                    <p>“How silent you are, dear Millicent,—almost sad, I think.”</p>
                    <p>The sound of his voice made her smile.</p>
                    <p>“No, not sad, I could not be so now, I am too deeply, really happy. But
                        to‐day, I do not know how it is,—I fear you will think me fanciful,—only I
                        feel such a terror.”</p>
                    <p>“A terror of what?” he asked, anxiously.</p>
                    <p>“Of life, I think,” she answered; “it seems to me such a fearfully precarious
                        thing,—its entire happiness or utter misery hangs on so slender a thread.
                        Often,—the living or dying of one single hope, can make it a beautiful and
                        blessed gift, or a crushing, intolerable burden. Its destinies are<pb
                            n="253" xml:id="VAB7183-254"/> so irretrievable, if once the soul has
                        been wrecked on its treacherous waves, where it wanders, seeking joy, then
                        the perishing of its peace is beyond all recall, and it is borne on by the
                        tide through tempests and gloom, dead to all earthly bliss, as the corpse
                        drifting down to its grave in the deep. I feel just now as if it required
                        such courage to live, it is such a perilous venture: to‐day we are
                        happy,—to‐morrow, but one step more in our mortal journey, may have plunged
                        us into a hopelessness of sorrow, from which we never rise again. The life
                        once doomed, can never return to the days of its hope and freedom. Though
                        its ruin may have been worked in our youth, and that of our own very hands,
                        yet the one chance is gone, and the game lost for us,—we cannot go back to
                        mould it anew. Cheerless and dark as we made it, it drags with us on to old
                        age and to death.”</p>
                    <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7183-255"/>
                    <p>“Dear Millicent, these are dark words, indeed! I hardly know you, speaking
                        thus. All you say is perfectly true, no doubt, but it should only make us
                        rejoice the more that <emph>our</emph> venture in the great game of life has
                        been so fortunate. Our prospects are bright enough, are they not? You have
                        nothing to fear for yourself: so far as one may judge the future, there is
                        only calm enjoyment before you.”</p>
                    <p>“I do not think it can be for myself I fear, though, in truth, I hardly know
                        what it is that terrifies me to‐night,—but cannot be any thought of myself;
                        for, Stephen, you do not know, I never can tell you, how all my hopes, and
                        wishes, and feelings, have become absorbed in one intense, unutterable
                        longing for your happiness. It is my one dream, my one thought,—I can seek,
                        I can strive for nothing else. I almost fear it must be wrong, to be so
                        given up to this one<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7183-256"/> thought, I cannot
                        even pray for anything besides.”</p>
                    <p>He was touched by these words, the tone of her voice told how they came from
                        her very heart. He spoke to her with a grateful tenderness, and soon soothed
                        the passing agitation into which she had allowed herself to be betrayed;
                        then, anxious to divert her thoughts from the dark misgivings which seemed
                        unaccountably to have taken possession of her, he continued, with greater
                        cheerfulness,—</p>
                    <p>“Now I shall not let you think any more of these dismal forebodings. Tell me
                        rather what is that black shadow passing along the avenue down there? It
                        looks, at this distance, like a great spider creeping on towards the
                        house.”</p>
                    <p>“It is the carriage, I have no doubt, coming home with my cousin Juliet. You
                        know she is to arrive to‐day from Italy, and this is just the hour when she
                        was expected.”</p>
                    <pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7183-257"/>
                    <p>“True,—I remember! I am rather anxious to see this same cousin of yours; I
                        heard of her often at Milan, but never chanced to meet her. You have never
                        seen her yourself, have you?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, no; she has been absent ever since I was at Rookcliffe—but they speak of
                        her constantly. I have heard her described many times.”</p>
                    <p>“And always as a wonderfully beautiful person, have you not? At least, that
                        was the reputation she had in Italy, and my artist friends were by no means
                        easy to please on that subject.”</p>
                    <p>“I suppose there were never two opinions as to Juliet’s beauty; even Charles
                        was enthusiastic about her. She must be a strange person, from his account;
                        he described her to me, as having a very subtle, powerful mind, hid beneath
                        a great outward appearance of frankness.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, excuse me if I seem rather un‐<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7183-258"/>
                        gallant, but I confess I have no faith in any woman possessing, that sort of
                        depth of character, which has the Machiavelian talent of concealing great
                        power under apparent simplicity. They have intensity of feeling, but rarely
                        are capable of profound calculations. One can read them right easily, and
                        pleasant reading it is, too, Millicent dear, at least in some cases.”</p>
                    <p>“I hope you mean that as a compliment, for I shall certainly appropriate it,”
                        said Millicent, laughing. “But I trust you are right about Juliet, for I
                        feel rather afraid of her, after all I have heard.”</p>
                    <p>“On the contrary, you must try to make a friend of her. It annoys me to see
                        you meeting with so little sympathy among those Egertons—Anne freezing you,
                        Sophia lecturing, and Fanny worrying. I hope Juliet will be more
                        companionable.”</p>
                    <p>“I doubt it; but we must go and see her now, for I have a vision of my
                            uncle<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7183-259"/> undergoing, all those tremendous
                        moral consequences, which are the invariable result of his having to wait
                        for his dinner. First, he falls entirely from the dignity of human nature,
                        and loses command of his temper, for a matter of five minutes’ delay, in a
                        material enjoyment; then he lowers his intellectual being, altogether below
                        the level of the earthly, and shows himself a slave to bodily wants; next,
                        he perverts and wastes one of the noblest gifts given to man, the power of
                        administering to the pleasure of others, by tormenting every one round him,
                        and horribly reproaching the delinquent who causes the delay; then, as to
                        his duties as a husband and a father, he of course fails,—but I will not go
                        on, for I see you are laughing, Stephen.”</p>
                    <p>“As I always do at your extraordinary system of analysis. However, let us
                        hurry home, by all means, and prevent the deterioration of Mr. Egerton’s
                        moral nature.”</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7183-260"/>
                    <p>They met Fanny in the hall at Rookcliffe, where Aylmer was at present
                        staying.</p>
                    <p>“Juliet is arrived!” she exclaimed; “she has been asking for you, Millicent,
                        but now you must wait till she comes down to dinner, for she has gone to
                        dress.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent went to her room, and the indescribable gloom which had for the
                        time been dispelled by Aylmer’s gay conversation, returned upon her with
                        redoubled force. When she rose to go to the drawing room she paused a moment
                        ere she passed the large mirror which reflected her figure; her cheek was
                        pale, and her countenance devoid, for the time, of the bright, lively
                        expression which formed its great charm. She still wore mourning for her
                        father, and the peculiar truthfulness of her character made her at all times
                        dress with a severe simplicity, which, just as she intended, did not enhance
                        her beauty. She could not endure to use any art or forethought<pb n="260"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-261"/> in order to make herself seem other than she was;
                        and now, as she looked at her own unpretending appearance, she sighed, while
                        she murmured—</p>
                    <p>“Aylmer would surely have wished for a fairer bride!”</p>
                    <p>She did not know how much, at that very moment, was lovely in her face as its
                        expression shadowed forth the feelings of her generous heart, nor even how
                        pleasing in the sight of all were those large brown eyes and the soft hair,
                        almost of the same colour, shading the pale, quiet brow. Yet, certainly,
                        there was a strange contrast between herself and the radiant figure that met
                        her gaze as she entered the drawing‐room. She started back almost terrified
                        at the sight which presented itself—either she was dreaming, or there was
                        before her the exact counterpart, the living embodiment of the pictured
                        figure in which Aylmer had represented his ideal—the countenance was not the
                        same, but the dress, the attitude,<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7183-262"/> the
                        flowing hair, the head turned round with the same studied grace, all
                        combined to render the resemblance most striking. In the midst of that
                        half‐darkened room she stood, the dark oak furniture and heavy crimson
                        curtains forming an admirable background, clothed in a dress of the purest
                        white, falling in soft folds around her—no ornament except her own
                        magnificent hair, which was allowed to wave in golden masses, so as almost
                        to veil the fair face, with a defiance of all ordinary customs which seemed
                        quite admissible in one so beautiful. And the countenance, (alone unlike the
                        bright vision of the artist’s dreams,) how marvelously lovely it was! a
                        beauty not to be described, it dwelt so much in the softness and sweetness
                        of her expression, and the dazzling brilliancy of her large beaming eyes.
                        Then the perfect grace of her slightest movement, were it but the gentle
                        falling of the delicate hand<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7183-263"/> and arm, or
                        the singular lightness of the step, with which she glided forward, seeming
                        to carry light and beauty wherever she went—the whole effect was so perfect,
                        that it never conveyed the idea of what was, in fact, the truth, that her
                        every attitude, and look, and action, were the result of the most studied
                        calculation.</p>
                    <p>A terrible snare to Juliet Egerton had been her great loveliness. She had
                        delivered herself up to the evil influence, it has the power to exercise
                        without a struggle. The one sole object of her life, was to gain all the
                        fair gifts of this world which beauty had the power to procure for
                        her,—universal admiration—the praise of men—the love of many hearts. Self
                        was with her all in all. So soon as an idea, a wish, a feeling rose in her
                        mind, it must straightway be gratified at any cost; the consequences to
                        others were never to be thought of, and her great natural talent, her
                        subtle, intriguing mind ably assisted<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7183-264"/> her
                        in carrying out whatever she designed to accomplish.</p>
                    <p>Her present return to Rookcliffe was, she well knew, most opportune for the
                        execution of a design, which had for some time been powerfully agitating her
                        mind, and which, in a singular manner, affected the interests of those now
                        present with her.</p>
                    <p>It was only for a few brief instants that Millicent Grey looked upon her in
                        silence, but in that space she had time to observe that the meaning look, in
                        the splendid eyes of Juliet Egerton, which so remarkably imitated the
                        expression in the fair face of Aylmer’s ideal, was turned upon her own
                        future husband, whilst his gaze was riveted upon her cousin’s countenance in
                        evident admiration.</p>
                    <p>Quickly, however, the picture full of life and interest which they presented
                        thus grouped, dissolved away at the sound of Mr. Egerton’s voice.</p>
                    <p>“Come, Millicent, and make acquaintance<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7183-265"/>
                        with your new cousin.—Juliet, this is our dear Millicent.”</p>
                    <p>“<foreign xml:lang="lat">Pro tempore</foreign>, Miss Grey,—<foreign
                            xml:lang="fre">bientôt</foreign>, Mrs. Aylmer,” said Charles.</p>
                    <p>Juliet instantly passed from her striking attitude to another no less
                        graceful, with arms outstretched to embrace her new relation. She glided
                        towards her;—in the softest and sweetest of tones expressed her delight at
                        meeting her, and when the first few sentences had passed between them, wound
                        her arm round her neck, and drew her gently back to the spot where Aylmer
                        stood. Millicent could not account for it, but she felt that she infinitely
                        preferred the Siberian shake of Anne’s elegant fingers, or the stern grasp
                        of Sophia’s hand, to the warm embrace of Juliet. She answered gently and
                        kindly to her enthusiastic expressions of pleasure, and then slipping from
                        the soft twining arms, took refuge at Aylmer’s side. He scarcely heeded her,
                        so intent was his gaze on Juliet,<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7183-266"/> who now
                        stood bending over a table, apparently engaged in examining some object that
                        lay upon it.</p>
                    <p>“Is it not extraordinary how she resembles the picture of your ideal?” said
                        Millicent to Aylmer, “and yet you never saw her?”</p>
                    <p>“The likeness has struck you also, then,” exclaimed Aylmer, quickly; “it is
                        indeed most remarkable. What a strange coincidence!”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps no coincidence,” said the soft musical voice. They could hardly tell
                        who spoke, for Juliet had not turned her head, yet the tones were hers, and
                        her hearing must have been singularly acute to have caught the words of
                        their whispered remark. Aylmer looked bewildered, and Millicent felt a
                        strange terror, as though she had suddenly been brought in contact with one
                        of those dangerous magicians of whom we read in the German tales, who are so
                        wonderfully beautiful, and so full of subtle wickedness.</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7183-267"/>
                    <p>Aylmer had no time to ask an explanation, for they now went to dinner. Juliet
                        sat opposite to him, and engaged his whole attention, as in truth that of
                        all others. She monopolized the conversation, and spoke well and
                        brilliantly. She talked only of Italy and the fine arts,—of music, but
                        chiefly of painting, and that with a wild enthusiasm which lit up her
                        charming face with redoubled beauty, and kindled the very souls of her
                        hearers.</p>
                    <p>“You talk so like an artist, Juliet,” said Charles, “that I begin to be
                        suspicious of the contents of some large boxes I saw among your packages.
                        Pray, do they contain your own performances as a <foreign xml:lang="ita"
                            >pittrice</foreign>?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, my own despair that is embodied on canvas,” she answered, with her gay
                        ringing laugh, “for it is nothing less than despair, to find how impossible
                        it is to give a material existence, to the fair visions of one’s dreams.
                            <emph>You</emph> can never feel this,” she<pb n="267"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-268"/> continued, suddenly turning and fixing her large
                        eyes full on Aylmer’s countenance.</p>
                    <p>The great peculiarity of her beauty was the singular contrast of those eyes,
                        so dark as to be almost black, with her golden‐coloured hair. She well knew
                        their power when, as now, she fixed them with their intense gaze on the face
                        of Aylmer.</p>
                    <p>“Indeed you are mistaken. I know the feeling of which you speak right well.
                        The pictures of my dreams, are not more like the reality, than the glowing
                        landscapes we sometimes fancy we see, among the sunset’s radiant clouds, are
                        like the earthly scenes of rock and stone. I suppose no painter ever was or
                        could be satisfied with the outward expression of those beautiful shapes,
                        that pass before his spirit, any more than the poet is content with the
                        words into which he seeks to infuse the fire of his heart, or the composer,
                        with the notes in which he would breathe out his soul’s harmony.”</p>
                    <pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7183-269"/>
                    <p>“Doubtless, but were it not so, there would be no arriving at perfection,”
                        said Juliet.</p>
                    <p>“It is the struggling of the soul to beam through the thick veil of this
                        mortal body,” said Millicent: she spoke so low that Arthur only heard
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“You must tell me how you knew that I was an artist?” said Aylmer to Juliet.
                        She made no answer, but the large eyes still gazed on him with a look too
                        strange and intense, to seem bold,—he preferred that look to an answer,—it
                        was plain that some mystery existed in her mind respecting him, which awoke
                        his interest and curiosity, to the uttermost.</p>
                    <p>“At least you will let me see your own pictures. I feel sure they are
                        striking.”</p>
                    <p>“To‐morrow,” she said, and resumed a more general conversation.</p>
                    <p>She seemed bent on making a conquest of Millicent, and addressed her
                        continually, but chiefly on subjects with which it was<pb n="269"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-270"/> impossible she should be acquainted, so that the
                        contrast between Juliet’s animated remarks and her cousin’s quiet answers,
                        was the more striking. To say the truth, Millicent had never been so dull or
                        so incapable of conversing at all. Her wonted vivacity seemed unaccountably
                        gone,—she was humbled and subdued, she knew not why. Aylmer more than once
                        looked at her with an expression of disappointment, for her light‐hearted
                        cheerfulness had been a great attraction to him.</p>
                    <p>In the evening he sought especially, to find an opportunity of asking Juliet
                        an explanation, of her mysterious resemblance to his picture, but this she
                        seemed determined he should not have. Once only she was alone when he came
                        near her, and then starting up, she went to the piano with a smile which
                        invited him to follow. She sat for a few moments, passing her hands dreamily
                        over the keys, as though gradually losing con‐<pb n="270"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-271"/> sciousness of where she was: then suddenly she
                        burst out into a very flood of song, as singular as it was beautiful. Her
                        voice was not very strong but strangely sweet, and she knew how to throw
                        into it a passionate earnestness, which agitated every heart that heard her.
                        Aylmer was perfectly entranced,—he entreated her to go on song after song,
                        and she seemed unwearied, and carried away from all around her, as any bird
                        that carols in the high clear air.</p>
                    <p>Millicent sat, meanwhile, in a large armchair near the fire; she crouched
                        down in it as though she would have hid herself, and sought a shelter.
                        Arthur was placed behind her; his head rested against the chair on which she
                        reclined; neither spoke, and so passed the evening. They were to separate at
                        last for the night. Mr. Egerton systematically marshalled his troop, and
                        presented each individual with their candlestick, as though he were arming
                        them, for some important<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7183-272"/> combat;—it was
                        Juliet’s turn, and she came gliding in her white robes from the darkened
                        part of the room where the piano stood. Her eyes turned with a beaming
                        glance on Aylmer,—her lips but half opened, to murmur a soft <foreign
                            xml:lang="ita">buona notte, dormi bene</foreign>! and the bright figure
                        disappeared on the dark threshold. He stood rooted to the spot, so lost in
                        thought that he did not perceive his young bride at his side, waiting to
                        wish him good night.</p>
                    <p>It was strange that Millicent had not felt the faintest pang of jealousy
                        towards Juliet. Her perfect guilelessness, and the trusting simplicity of
                        her character, seemed to save her from the most miserable peculiarity of the
                        woman’s nature. She judged Aylmer by herself,—true and unchangng as human
                        heart, may be, was hers, in its deep love for him, and so she believed of
                        him. He was her promised husband: surely nothing could ever make him other
                        than her own. It was<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7183-273"/> natural that his
                        artist’s eye should be charmed with Juliet’s beauty, his musical ear
                        ravished with her exquisite singing, but his heart’s affection she thought
                        was not the less given to her by voluntary choice, by solemn word and
                        promise.</p>
                    <p>She stood lifting up those trusting tender eyes to his thoughtful face, but
                        not till she extended her hand, and whispered her earnest “Good night,” did
                        he notice her presence. Then, as he looked down and met that sweet smile,
                        that loving gaze, one less guileless than she was might have trembled to see
                        how the blood rushed to his forehead, under the remorseful sting of
                        recollection,—he clasped her hand in his, and his “Good night, dearest
                        Millicent,” was so warm and energetic, that it brought tears into those
                        gentle eyes. She went to rest, with a lightened heart.</p>
                    <p>There was another who went to his room that night, with the crushing weight
                            that<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7183-274"/> long had lain upon his soul,
                        stirring within him as though it were about to be lifted off. There was one
                        who threw open his window, who leant far out, faint and breathless, to bathe
                        his head in the cold night air. Arthur Egerton was gasping,—panting with
                        hope. Hope the forgotten,—the exiled had returned, and was careering a
                        conquerer through his soul, casting down the strongholds which despair had
                        built up, undermining that mountain of anguish, carrying light to those
                        chambers of gloom where the human idol stood on its pedestal and was
                        worshipped,—(albeit, there was no heart for him in its bosom.)</p>
                    <p>There are some characters full of an inherent power and energy, which is of
                        depth inconceivable,—who are filled with a terrible capacity for good or
                        evil, which is never called into life until some ungovernable affection,
                        fearful in its strength, becomes to the man a very principle of
                            existence,<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7183-275"/> and the latent force comes
                        forth to work the will of this new master. It was so with Arthur Egerton;
                        his fiery poetic soul, his intensely feeling heart, his strong sound
                        intellect, had all been of late turned into one channel, all had been given
                        to spend, and to be spent, in the love of Millicent Grey; and now, powers of
                        which he had known nothing, and which might well have appalled himself, had
                        he known them as they were, powers to resolve and to execute, to work evil,
                        if in evil there were hope,—to make a path on the hearts of his
                        fellow‐creatures, if none other might be found, were rising up within him,
                        armed and ready, to aid and abet him, in the one object for which he lived,
                        the attainment of her love, as she loved Stephen Aylmer. There had been a
                        time, brief as those radiant moments, when the sun bathes the world in light
                        ere it sinks to utter darkness, when had believed she loved him. None had
                        ever looked on him with the tender pity she had<pb n="275"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-276"/> shown, and this deceived him, so that to him who
                        never had known the unutterable sweetness of human affection (for he was
                        repulsive to the very mother who bore him,) brighter, dearer, more
                        inconceivably precious than mortal words can tell, was the thought that he,
                        the wanderer and outcast, had found in her true heart a home.</p>
                    <p>This dream had been dispelled, how utterly! Not many weeks after Stephen
                        Aylmer passed the threshold of the old Hall at Rookcliffe, in Millicent’s
                        first look of affection on another, Arthur understood that she had never
                        felt for him aught save barren pity, and straightway in that hour the fair,
                        sweet hope he cradled in his breast, died in the agony with which a
                        slaughtered man expires. So long as it lay within him a corpse, making a
                        charnel house of his soul, he had but one thought,—the thought that has been
                        dreary yet sweet comfort to most of us, at least once in a lifetime, that
                            the<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7183-277"/> hour must come when he would go to
                        lay down his head on the breast of his mother earth, and rest from this
                        tyranny of wretchedness. But hope had revived; faint as the faintest streaks
                        of dawn, that give the far‐off promise of a future day, were the indications
                        of a possible change which might cast back Millicent upon his unbounded
                        love, a poor lost outcast, desolate herself, as he was desolate;—but they
                        were enough to rouse in hope, the clinging tenacity of life. It had started,
                        breathing, gasping, from its tomb and with it Arthur lived again. He lived
                        again a new life, as it were, which, with all its capacity, its energy, its
                        power, was to be devoted to this one sole object,—that he might feel again
                        as he had felt when he believed she loved him.</p>
                    <p> He was almost terrified at the indomitable strength he felt within him to
                        overthrow all obstacles, to work by any means for this his heart’s
                        desire.</p>
                    <pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7183-278"/>
                    <p>Arthur Egerton had neither hope nor love out of this world, which could
                        induce him to feel that there is but one thing to be ardently desired on
                        earth, even the preservation of the soul’s rectitude and purity, but rather
                        having delivered up his spirit to the adoration of one earthly good, it
                        seemed to him a noble thing to offer in sacrifice to it, if need were, even
                        the very dignity of his moral being, his very honour and integrity. He had
                        an instinctive consciousness of this great truth, that no personal
                        gratification can be obtained without departing from that fixed standard of
                        right, in which one of the first principles, is the immolation of self for
                        the good of others.</p>
                    <p>But nothing is more easy than to render crime poetical, Arthur’s gift of
                        genius, hitherto wasted, was now perverted, and cast a most false glow over
                        his deep selfish love. It made his heart throb with a powerful delight, to
                        feel that not only he<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7183-279"/> would compass earth
                        for her, and trample on whosoever stood between them, but that he would not
                        withhold from her he deemed worthy of his uttermost affection, even to the
                        gift of his soul’s righteousness and honour. He must be patient, but patient
                        with an invincible purpose standing like an armed warrior at his side. That
                        which he called destiny seemed working for him;—he would step aside, and
                        watch as a tiger for his prey, and when the events he expected had done
                        their part, then would he rush in to effect all that might remain
                        unaccomplished of his life’s desire. So now betake thee to thy troubled
                        sleep, most wretched man!—for the thoughts of this night shalt thou repent
                        thee yet, in sack‐cloth and in ashes, sprinkled on thy fallen head by the
                        cold hands of the dead.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> morning light brought Juliet Egerton fairer than ever before the
                        eyes of Aylmer. She came bounding through the glass door of the
                        breakfast‐room, her hands full of flowers, radiant and bright as a type of
                        the morning itself. She stopped, and held them up in triumph just where the
                        sunshine was streaming into the room, so that the golden rays flashed on her
                        waving hair, and lit up her brilliant eyes. Her clear voice sounded a gay
                        good morning to<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7183-281"/> all; but to Aylmer there
                        came a few words of softest Italian, heard by himself alone.</p>
                    <p>It was not wonderful if this dazzling figure shut out from his eyes that
                        other so gentle and nunlike, that sat patiently admiring her beautiful
                        cousin. And yet captivated as Aylmer certainly was by Juliet’s remarkable
                        loveliness, it was not her outward fascination which had already so
                        powerfully drawn him towards her,—it was the evident interest springing from
                        some mysterious source which existed in her mind for him. He could not
                        account for it. He was certain he had never seen her before, yet he felt
                        that they were not strangers, he felt that he was known to her in no common
                        way. It was impossible but that this conviction should deeply occupy him,—it
                        caused him to scrutinize her every look and gesture, and each one of these
                        movements, as he watched her, seemed more graceful than the last, swiftly
                            drawing<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7183-282"/> out his soul in worship to the
                        Beautiful there present in her. As the day wore on, there was a smile of
                        indescribable triumph on the face of Arthur whose eyes followed Millicent
                        Grey wheresoever she went.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer had petitioned that he might see Juliet’s paintings; but she refused
                        to show them till a room had been appropriated to her use as “studio,” where
                        she might arrange them in suitable lights, and where, hereafter, she might
                        paint undisturbed.</p>
                    <p>This was not done till late in the afternoon; and the whole morning he sat
                        entranced with her voice as she sang or spoke to him in her liquid Italian.
                        Still, he was never alone with her: she was constantly at Millicent’s side.
                        Juliet would look from Aylmer to her at times with an air of melancholy
                        interest, and seemed anxious to draw her into conversation; but poor
                        Millicent never appeared to so much disadvantage. And had Aylmer been
                            less<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7183-283"/> blinded he would have seen how
                        artfully Juliet’s remarks were calculated to produce this effect.</p>
                    <p>Millicent had left the room, and Juliet, who stood thoughtfully looking after
                        her, turned to Sophia.</p>
                    <p>“It is strange, I do not think you have described Millicent in your letters
                        at all as she is. Charles and the rest of you used to speak of her charming
                        vivacity and cheerfulness. She seems to me possessed of none at all. She is
                        so very—I hardly know what to call it—I should say sad, if that were not
                        impossible, with so bright a fate as hers.”</p>
                    <p>“Out of humour will express it, I have no doubt,” said Anne, who, by some
                        conjuring trick of a mental nature, invariably transferred her own faults to
                        the possession of others.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent is spoilt,” said Sophia, in her usual sententious manner.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7183-284"/>
                    <p>“What has spoilt her?” asked Juliet. Sophia looked with phlegmatic prudence
                        to the corner of the room, where Aylmer sat reading, and paused in her
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>“He does not hear—he is too distant from us,” said Fanny, eagerly. Her lively
                        curiosity condescended to the most insignificant material for an aliment;
                        and she was bent on hearing Sophia’s definition of the change in their
                        cousin.</p>
                    <p>“It is the prospect of her marriage which has spoilt her; she has never been
                        the same creature since. I suppose she is much elated by it, though how any
                        one can be elated by the entire loss of their independence, and the
                        subjection of their will to one of their fellow creatures, on a mere
                        equality with themselves, passes my comprehension; but, certainly, I had
                        trusted Millicent was beginning to profit by my instructions, and now she
                        has eyes and ears for none but Mr. Aylmer. I presume she imagines herself
                        perfect since he chose her.”</p>
                    <pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7183-285"/>
                    <p>“She has not much to be proud of, I can tell her,” said Anne, with her
                        habitual sneer. “If ever a man was driven into a marriage, he was. Colonel
                        Bentley never rested till he made up the match; and I only wonder Stepheu
                        Aylmer was so easily led.”</p>
                    <p>“Dear Anne, do be careful, he will hear you,” said Juliet, with her soft
                        voice, by no means so low pitched as usual, and a gleam of triumph in her
                        eyes, as she saw that she had effectcd her object, and that his sudden
                        movement showed he had heard these remarks.</p>
                    <p>The painting‐room was arranged at last, and the whole family assembled to see
                        Juliet’s pictures. They were large oil paintings, chiefly copies from the
                        old masters. Aylmer was struck with surprise at the sight of them; although
                        she had not in the remotest degree attained to his own excellence in the
                        art; they were yet<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7183-286"/> so full of original
                        genius that he was delighted. He spoke his approbation strongly.</p>
                    <p>“It is plain you are but a beginner,” he said, at last, “but with energy and
                        perseverance you may attain to a high degree of perfection.”</p>
                    <p>“I can do nothing unaided,” said Juliet. “In Italy I never could work unless
                        my dear old master were at my side to call out ‘<foreign xml:lang="ita"
                            >corragio</foreign>’ every moment, and to fill me by his enthusiastic
                        words with what he called ‘<foreign xml:lang="ita">l’anima
                            Italiana</foreign>.’ I wish you were Italian and a painting master,”.
                        she added, turning her bright peculiar glance, with its sudden impulse, on
                        Aylmer.</p>
                    <p>“I will be both to you,” said Aylmer, earnestly.</p>
                    <p>“Do you mean what you say? I may take you at your word? Oh, how gladly! But,
                        for you, is it not a rash offer? Think of the long hours when the master
                        must guide the pupil’s powerless hand. Is it <foreign xml:lang="ita"
                            >davvero</foreign>?”</p>
                    <pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7183-287"/>
                    <p>“<foreign xml:lang="ita">Davvero</foreign>! I do mean what I said most
                        seriously. I will be your master. You could have none here, and I cannot see
                        such a talent left uncultivated.”</p>
                    <p>“Then the office is upon you beyond recall. Oh, how thankful I am that I
                        shall yet be a painter!” Juliet looked up as if she had no thought but
                        enthusiastic delight at the prospect of being assisted in her pursuit of her
                        favourite art.</p>
                    <p>“Indeed, Mr. Aylmer, I shall be very glad if you will kindly give my daughter
                        a few lessons in your leisure moments,” said Mr. Egerton, who had an
                        inconceivable aversion to the class of individuals whom he was wont to term
                        generally “Monsieurs,” and who infested his house at the period of the Miss
                        Egertons’ education. Like most Englishmen, who have never left their own
                        country, he was under the strong conviction that they were all rascals, and
                        felt profoundly uneasy about the silver spoons, whenever they were asked to
                        luncheon.</p>
                    <pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7183-288"/>
                    <p>“How many leisure moments has Aylmer had of late, Millicent?” said Charles,
                        as he stretched himself in the luxurious arm‐chair, provided for Juliet’s
                        future accommodation. “Of course the time when he is occupied with you must
                        be said to be devoted to business. An engaged man goes to his duty as
                        regularly as a clerk to his desk, for so many hours a day. I have no doubt
                        you make the work as pleasant as any could,—sweet little Millicent,—but
                        commend me to my freedom.”</p>
                    <p>This was certainly not a pleasant speech for Aylmer, and, after the manner of
                        most men, he visited his annoyance on the unoffending. He glanced, half
                        angrily, at Millicent, and turned from her with a movement of impatience.
                        There is a French expression, which alone can render Millicent’s feeling at
                        that moment “<foreign xml:lang="fre">ce mouvement lui serra le
                            cœur</foreign>.” She felt dreary and chilled with a longing to take
                        refuge somewhere<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7183-289"/> hid from all eyes; and,
                        at once, as if answering to her secret thought, a hand drew her gently down
                        on a seat, in an unnoticed corner. She looked up with a glance of humble
                        gratitude, (for we are mostly humble in sorrow,) to him whose kindness was
                        so opportune, and met the gaze of Arthur full of tenderest pity. Already,
                        then, their offices were changed: he was the consoler, and she the
                        afflicted, and the thick loud beating of his heart, as he thought upon it,
                        might almost have been heard through the room.</p>
                    <p>“Well, now we shall leave Juliet in undisturbed possession of her studio,”
                        said Mrs. Egerton, as she rose and kissed her handsome daughter with proud
                        satisfaction. She was truest to the woman’s nature in her overweening
                        indulgence of this favourite child. They all left the room; Aylmer held the
                        door open for the ladies to pass, for Charles and Arthur had gone out<pb
                            n="289" xml:id="VAB7183-290"/> together. Millicent looked back, thinking
                        he was following her, but he stood gazing on Juliet, as she bent over her
                        easel. Millicent heard the door close: he had remained with her cousin.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose Mr. Aylmer is going to give his first lesson, it will be a real
                        pleasure to so enthusiastic an artist as he is,” remarked Mrs. Egerton. “My
                        Juliet has such extraordinary talent.”</p>
                    <p>“Millicent,” said Arthur, in a supplicating voice, which trembled in spite of
                        himself, “will you come and walk with me a little while in the garden: it is
                        so long, so very long, since we have been together there.”</p>
                    <p>“Dear Arthur, pray excuse me to‐day, my head aches, and,
                        besides,”—Millicent’s tender conscience took the alarm at any
                        equivocation,—“I think I promised,—I believe Mr. Aylmer expects me to walk
                        with him.” She could not have left the house where he was.</p>
                    <pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7183-291"/>
                    <p>“Not yet,” murmured Arthur, as he turned away, “but soon, very soon, that
                        heart cannot live without affection. Cast out, and deserted, where should
                        she fly but to my love, so devoted and unutterable.”</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, within the studio, a new scene of the drama was being enacted.
                        Aylmer had shut the door, and quickly approached Juliet.</p>
                    <p>“You cannot escape me, now. You must explain the mystery which bewilders,
                        while it charms me. I feel in my inmost soul that we are not strangers one
                        to another,—yet we met but yesterday!”</p>
                    <p>“Strangers, no, truly!” she looked round sweetly, confidingly to him, as we
                        look on the familiar features of a favourite brother.</p>
                    <p>“But, then, where, when, how did we meet!” he exclaimed, still more moved. “I
                            <emph>know</emph> I never looked upon your face before; do you think I
                        could have forgotten it?”</p>
                    <pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7183-292"/>
                    <p>“Yet I know yours well,” she said, with her sweet smile, “and the tones of my
                        voice, you have heard them many times.”</p>
                    <p>“It struck me so,” exclaimed Aylmer: “the first words I heard you utter, were
                        like a strain of well‐remembered music, that long ago had passed melodious
                        on my ear. But your voice, as we have all remarked, resembles so strangely
                        that of your cousin Millicent, that I fancied it was her tones I recognized
                        in yours.”</p>
                    <p>Juliet shook her head almost sadly, “It is not so, and it were best I should
                        resemble her in nothing.”</p>
                    <p>“Do not let us talk of her, just now,” said Aylmer, impatiently, “but, tell
                        me what claim I have upon your acquaintance, I believe I might say your
                        friendship and oh! may that claim be a strong one.”</p>
                    <p>“I knew you were here,” said Juliet, dreamily, as though she were rather
                            wan‐<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7183-293"/> dering back through the regions
                        of the past in her own memory, than directly answering his question, “I knew
                        that you had come to live near this place four months ago, and I thought it
                        was strange that Rookcliffe was my home,—I thought I should come and show
                        you how my soul understood the artist‐soul within you, by bringing into
                        actual life the vision of your glorious picture,—then I thought that I
                        should tell you all.”</p>
                    <p>“All! how much may be in that word!” thought Aylmer, with a thrill of
                        delight.</p>
                    <p>“And you will tell me all now, then?” he exclaimed to Juliet; “the time is
                        come, as you thought!”</p>
                    <p>“Not as I thought,”—her countenance assumed an expression of rigid decision,
                        which gave it a statue‐like beauty,—“ I will not, I cannot tell now.”</p>
                    <p>“How!” exclaimed Aylmer; “you surely cannot mean it. This is unkind and
                            cruel.<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7183-294"/> What should prevent you? You
                        said you had resolved to tell.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes! but I knew not then that things would be as they are.”</p>
                    <p>Ambiguous as was this speech, he understood at once that she alluded to his
                        marriage. How the poor heart of Millicent Grey would have died within her
                        had she seen the expression of his face,—that of Juliet swelled with
                        triumph.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was silent for a few moments, then he looked up with a sort of calm
                        sadness.</p>
                    <p>“Am I to understand, then, that you will never tell me the meaning of this
                        hidden sympathy, which draws my soul to you, as though you were some friend
                        of childhood, some companion cherished long? Am I to live near you
                        constantly as the mere stranger, which, in the common course of events, I
                        should be to you, with the feeling half maddening me the while that<pb
                            n="294" xml:id="VAB7183-295"/> in very truth we have been and are,
                        although I know not by what mystery, friends in no common way? Will you
                            <emph>never</emph> tell me, <foreign xml:lang="ita">amica
                            incognita</foreign>, what is the strange, sweet link between us?”</p>
                    <p>“Never,” she answered, in a low, melancholy tone, as though she had caught
                        the reflection of his sadness,—“never, <emph>now</emph>! at least not
                        until—yes, perhaps the day may come when it will avail you nothing, for good
                        or ill, to know the truth, and then, if you wish it, I will tell
                        you,—however, bitter were the revelation to myself. But now,”—she seemed to
                        make a violent effort, and assumed that air of forced gaiety which is more
                        touching than the wildest burst of sorrow,—“there is an interval when we may
                        be as friends together, and none shall have any true right to come between
                        as, when we may enjoy that communion of feeling which those who have the
                        artist soul alone can know. Yes, that communion<pb n="295"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-296"/> which I have dreamt of having with you this many
                        a long day; there is an interval which may be bright with that friendship I
                        had thought was to be ours, <emph>unchanging</emph>. Let us, then, forget
                        what past and present, were and are, and I at least will forget the future;
                        let us catch the sunbeam while it passes, and make merry with it. It will be
                        time to weep when the night cometh,—you know they say the dews fall at
                        evening.”</p>
                    <p>She bounded from him as she spoke, and went to the door, whilst he stood
                        motionless with agitation and bewilderment. There she paused, and said, in a
                        gentle, beseeching tone,—</p>
                    <p>“Promise it shall be as I have said. We <emph>are</emph> friends as few have
                        been: believe it on my word, and let us for this little time, unmoved by
                        that which is, or is to come, enjoy without constraint the intercourse which
                        a sympathy of thought, and tastes, and feelings will make as precious as it
                            is<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7183-297"/> rare. Ask no questions, seek no
                        change; be it understood that we have met in soul long since, and held much
                        converse, sweet and true, together, and now there remains but to snatch
                        these golden moments which are passing, and will pass too soon. Promise
                        me!”</p>
                    <p>“I will do all you choose, it is but too bright a prospect. Make of me what
                        you will.” He had hardly spoken when she passed from the room,—her power was
                        established.</p>
                    <p>From that day Juliet Egerton and Stephen Aylmer lived for one another. It was
                        as she had said; the scheme of ideal friendship she had proposed to him was
                        carried out to its full extent,—he gave up all thought of the future, and
                        abandoned himself to the charm of present intercourse. They had much in
                        common in their love of the fine arts, and their knowledge of Italian life
                        and habits. It became a settled custom<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7183-298"/>
                        that they always spoke Italian together, and this shut them up, as it were,
                        into a little world of their own.</p>
                    <p>Their mornings were spent in the painting room, not generally alone. Mrs.
                        Egerton was too tenacious of the world’s forms to allow of that, but quite
                        sufficiently isolated by the nature of their employment,—Juliet painting and
                        Aylmer instructing,—to hold such communion together, as was little dreamt of
                        by those around them. Day after day Juliet continued, unmolested, to
                        exercise her powers of fascination on her cousin’s future husband, with
                        every variety of art. She never did anything like other people, but her
                        undoubted eccentricity seemed quite justified by her remarkable beauty,
                        which already rendered her so unlike all others. No one ever thought of
                        finding fault with the peculiarity of her manners and habits: she was in all
                        things considered quite unique, and that bright<pb n="298"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-299"/> face won forgiveness by a look, for the daring
                        independence with which she followed her own wayward will.</p>
                    <p>They generally all went to ride together in the afternoon. Juliet was a bold
                        rider, and often, whilst they were all proceeding quietly together, she
                        would seem struck with some object in the distance, some rock or tree, or
                        opening in the landscape, that gave the promise of a fine view, and without
                        uttering a word, would cause her horse suddenly to bound away from her
                        companions and career at full speed across the country, never pausing till
                        she was lost to their sight altogether. Some one must follow her, of course,
                        in these wild flights, but Charles, who never allowed his ease or dignity to
                        be compromised by such hurried movements, invariably requested Aylmer to
                        take upon himself the care of his capricious sister, whilst he remained in
                        charge of the rest of the party; and Aylmer joyfully<pb n="299"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-300"/> accepting the mission, would gallop after her, to
                        find her generally motionless on some rising ground, whence she could
                        command the prospect, the horse, curbed by her small vigorous hand, standing
                        still as a statue, and herself in an attitude equally fixed, having
                        uncovered her head, that the breeze might blow in its freshness on her fair
                        face, and sweep from her cheek the long, waving hair.</p>
                    <p>She never, perhaps, seemed so beautiful as in that position. The picture was
                        perfect, and entrancing to a man like Aylmer, the artist; and then as the
                        sound of his horse’s steps struck on her ear, the slow turning of that
                        graceful head, the glad smile breaking over the face, the soft entreaty to
                        be forgiven the wayward fancy, were full of an irresistible charm to him
                        that bowed the strong heart of the proud man to be the abject slave of that
                        woman’s will.</p>
                    <p>Then they would ride on together, talk‐<pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7183-301"/> ing
                        with that sweet intimate communion, that converse of soul with soul, which
                        when they are united in pure friendship, or in holy affection, has a joy
                        that must be a foretaste of that blessed intercourse of the brighter world,
                        when no veil of the flesh shall come between the happy spirits whose life of
                        love shall be then as now, to love one another.</p>
                    <p>But the intercourse of Aylmer with Juliet Egerton was not the less delightful
                        to themselves—that it partook not of this higher nature; and they would most
                        often rejoin their party only at the gate of Rookcliffe.</p>
                    <p>Again in the evening, half hidden in the recess where the piano stood, the
                        promised husband of Millicent Grey sat listening to the enchanting voice
                        that was speaking, as he felt it did speak, to his very soul in those wild
                        Italian words; nor was he ever for one moment arrested in his fascinated
                            admiration<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7183-302"/> by the fact, that every
                        word and look and action of Juliet Egerton’s was the result of the most
                        subtle calculation; for this was her special art, that she seemed ever
                        guided solely by ungovernable impulse. Woe be to her who uses the powers of
                        fascination given her by heaven for the purposes of earth!</p>
                    <p>By solemn appointment, and for a solemn mission, is their responsibility laid
                        on her,—even that with her beauty and her winning manner she may make stern
                        goodness lovely in the eyes of men, and cause severe uncompromising
                        holiness, to seem a sweet alluring thing; that with that voice of thrilling
                        harmony she may sing holy strains to fill the ears too often choked up with
                        a world’s fulsome flatteries, and by that soft charm in her aspect and her
                        words, which draws after her the hearts of many, teach men to listen and
                        submit themselves the more readily, to the sharp exacting lessons of
                            unchanging<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7183-303"/> truth, because one with an
                        angel’s look and tone hath spoken them.</p>
                    <p>But again we say, woe be to her who ignoring or rejecting this her mission,
                        degrades her loveliness to slave for earthly hopes, and perverts her gifts
                        of manifold allurement, to win for her only an earthly love.</p>
                    <p>All this while Stephen Aylmer had not an idea of the complete revolution
                        which had taken place in his entire being. He knew not that in the secret
                        history of his inner life, that change had occurred which colours the whole
                        existence, destroying all independence or freedom of will, and which he
                            <corr>had</corr> believed himself incapable of experiencing.</p>
                    <p>The power terrible in its extent, of an indomitable affection had risen up
                        and taken possession of this man, as the wild beast seizes on its prey with
                        some tremendous grasp, and now even as the victim lies palpitating and
                        crushed in the tiger’s fierce<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7183-304"/> embrace, so
                        did his soul lie fluttering beneath the might of this unconquerable love,
                        subdued and powerless for evermore!</p>
                    <p>But he knew it not—he knew that he was living in a rapturous dream from which
                        too surely he must wake one day, and therefore strove ever to put from him,
                        all thought of that waking and its consequences, till the dark hour should
                        arrive, and only sought the more madly to enjoy the present because it was
                        so fleeting.</p>
                    <p>He knew that the presence of Juliet Egerton was life to him, and most
                        bitterly, passionately, did he regret that before ever he saw her face, one
                        had come to stand between them to shut her out from his life so utterly. But
                        he knew not that when the hour of restitution came, and he must go forth
                        from that existence of fascination and excitement to take another by the
                        hand, and swear to love her only and her truly, until death, then would this
                        new power rise up within<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7183-305"/> him like an armed
                        giant from his ambush, and trample down his soul with crushing steps, till
                        truth and honour and compassion were cast out from it and the conqueror
                        passion reigned there alone.</p>
                    <p>He knew not this would be; for though often, as we have said, even with agony
                        he regretted, that he was bound by other ties, before that radiant face came
                        beaming on his life, he was yet a man of honour, and he never dreamt of
                        abandoning his promised bride. He fully intended when the time originally
                        fixed for their union should arrive, to fulfill his engagements, and become
                        her husband; but meanwhile, since this brief interval was all that was given
                        him of the intense happiness he never was to know again, he resolved, even
                        as Juliet had said, to give himself up to the full enjoyment of the
                        redeemless present, and let no thought of the future darken its exceeding
                        brightness.</p>
                    <p>It never occurred to him how fearfully<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7183-306"/> he
                        was already wronging Millicent by such a scheme; such desertion to the
                        spirit of his engagement, and mocking faithfulness to the letter of it. He
                        heard no complaint from her lips; gentle and patient, he had learned to
                        persuade himself that she was not susceptible, nor keenly alive to the many
                        tokens of neglect, which would have called forth such wild jealousy in
                        Juliet, had their positions been reversed.</p>
                    <p>He almost persuaded himself that Millicent was incapable of any very strong
                        and vivid feeling, when he compared the quiet proofs of unutterable
                        affection, which rose from the still deep waters of her soul, with the
                        glowing words of passionate attachment which, under the name of friendship,
                        came bursting from the lips of Juliet.</p>
                    <p>And, besides, whenever the thought came across him irresistibly, that truly
                        this entire devotion to another than his promised wife was unjustifiable,—he
                        laid this flattering<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7183-307"/> unction to his soul
                        that Juliet, likewise, had a distinct claim upon him, at least for these few
                        months, in the mysterious sympathy resulting from some strange former
                        intercourse, which she had proved to him must exist between them. Her
                        half‐uttered hints in the very commencement of their acquaintance had shown
                        him plainly, that, but for this unhappy engagement with her cousin, she had
                        come to Rookcliffe prepared to find him wholly hers, and to be his own in
                        heart and life.</p>
                    <p>Of course the Egerton family were not blind to the drama which was being
                        played before their eyes, but no one interfered by word or deed, or even by
                        a meaning look. There were various reasons for this. Charles having
                        attained, by some intricate process, to a most real and enviable
                        insensibility himself, never thought that possibly there might be the germs
                        of an agony, even unto death, in this working tragedy, for<pb n="307"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-308"/> some, if not all, of the actors therein. Sweet
                        little Millicent would soon find a better husband, he thought, if Aylmer
                        played her false; and meanwhile it was a wonderful enlivenment to the old
                        halls at Rookcliffe to have this exciting romance going on within them: he
                        would not disturb it on any account.</p>
                    <p>Further, there was a certain feeling existing in the minds of these three old
                        young ladies, his sisters, so perpetually in bewildered amazement that the
                        world had not yet seen fit to draw them from their immutable position in
                        changeless solitude, which caused them secretly to feel, that they had
                        somehow been personally aggrieved by their cousin’s speedy engagement, and
                        although they admitted it not to themselves, they did, in fact, look on her
                        probable desertion by Aylmer as a retribution justly due to them. They,
                            too,<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7183-309"/> would not have disturbed the
                        course of events for any inducement whatever.</p>
                    <p>In the heart of Mrs. Egerton the absorbing love of the child least worthy of
                        it, had left room for no other feeling.</p>
                    <p>She saw that Juliet had won the heart of Aylmer, and that she herself in
                        return seemed devotedly attached to him; therefore the mother ardently
                        desired their union, and was careful to promote their intercourse. Aylmer
                        was, moreover, precisely the husband she wished for Juliet; rich, talented,
                        and fond of continental life. As for Millicent, Mrs. Egerton had never quite
                        forgiven her for having come, with her bright, sunny face, and her clear,
                        vigorous mind, to contrast so unpleasantly with her own world‐worn,
                        artificial daughters, and, “indeed,” this fashion‐taught woman was wont to
                        think, “Millicent had always shown herself very independent of her care and
                        advice,—so now, if she lost Aylmer’s affec‐<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7183-310"
                        /> tion as speedily as she had won it, it was her own affair and she must
                        even make the best of it. As for her, she must look after her own child’s
                        interest.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Egerton would have been obtuse, indeed, had he not perceived that there
                        were storms brooding in the atmosphere round him,—storms where she, whose
                        guardian he was called, was fast making shipwreck for ever; but, really,
                        while the cook persisted in sending up such abominable <foreign
                            xml:lang="fre">entremets</foreign>, he could not think of anything but
                        having him taught better, or procuring another. He did believe that was the
                        best plan, to send him off, and have another from Paris; but then his
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">pâtés de foie gras</foreign> were capital; no
                        one could excel him, there was the difficulty. As to love‐making, they must
                        settle it among themselves: he had had enough of it in his own time, but he
                        was done with it long ago. Indeed, he wished he had never begun. There
                            was<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7183-311"/> his brother, the General, what a
                        comfortable old bachelor he was! nothing to trouble him, no one to think of
                        but himself, and what a cook <emph>he</emph> had!</p>
                    <p>So ruminated the head of the house, and so speculated the various members of
                        his family, whilst slowly and surely stealing along, the great agony of
                        Millicent Grey came forward to meet her on the pathway of life.</p>
                    <p>But, oh! Arthur Egerton! what a glorious opportunity was here afforded you,
                        of proving how noble and how bright a thing the human soul may be, when
                        strength is given it to suffer for the weal of others! Why did you not come
                        forward in this her hour of betrayal and friendlessness, armed with the
                        energy and zeal of your deep love, to interpose between her and the fierce
                        blow that was descending on her, by receiving it on your own heart? Yes! by
                        the holocaust of your life’s affection, you might have<pb n="311"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-312"/> saved her now: you might have won back for her
                        the happiness that is flitting fast away: you might have given up the dear
                        hope that exists for you, in the agony of her desertion, and with the strong
                        words of truth and rectitude, awakened that man from his ignominious dream,
                        to see how peerless is that true heart he is breaking, how unworthy her, for
                        whose sake he is so miserably fallen. You might have saved her; Arthur
                        Egerton, you might have thrown down the stronghold of your own solitary
                        hope, into which you suppose life and its joy are gathered, and from the
                        melancholy ruins built up again the tottering fabric of her happiness, now
                        shaking to its very centre. And who so blest, (not with earth’s blessing,)
                        as yourself, when having thus restored her to her well‐beloved home, in
                        another heart than yours, she went forth to live, and to enjoy, and to
                        forget you in your bitter solitude!—yes, who so blest, for<pb n="312"
                            xml:id="VAB7183-313"/> in your soul of earthly light bereft, would shine
                        the glory, ripe with promise, of that deed wherein you immolated self on the
                        altar of the Faith which speaks of holier love, and higher hope, and more
                        enduring joy!</p>
                    <p>But, to an earthly affection you have delivered up your spirit, and the
                        darkness of earth has closed in round it,—mists, arising from the dust out
                        of which your mortal frame was taken; so, cowering back in the shadow, you
                        sit watching with a keen cruel eye, till flung out by remorseless hands into
                        the desert of hope and of affection, you hope to find that helpless child,
                        compelled to seek a refuge by your side!</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                    <p><hi>SLOWLY</hi> along the path where she had walked with Aylmer on the night
                        of Juliet’s arrival, Millicent Grey went wandering alone. Cold and dreary
                        was the scene around her, for it was winter now; and nature without sunshine
                        is like the soul without hope.</p>
                    <p>With a heavy and a lingering tread she walks, her hands clasped on her bosom,
                        where the chilled heart beats faintly,—her head bowed down with an
                        earth‐drawn gaze, as theirs is bowed whose thoughts unconsci‐<pb n="2"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-003"/> ously are stealing on to the grave, as their
                        refuge best and sweetest.</p>
                    <p>And now it may be well to see how it fares with her who must thus
                        compassionless abide her destiny, and wait in silence the last shock of the
                        fierce passions raging round her.</p>
                    <p>It may seem unnatural, but heart‐sick and full of boding fears as Millicent
                        now was, she never yet had doubted Stephen Aylmer. Most guileless and most
                        trusting, nothing could have shaken in her the belief that whatever he did
                        was right. When she had given up to him her entire and unlimited affection,
                        she did so believing him as nearly perfect as any may be on this
                        earth,—herself had, with her warm imagination, gilded and painted her idol,
                        and then she fell down and worshipped it.</p>
                    <p>Whatever he said must be truth. She trusted more willingly his words than his
                        deeds, and whilst outwardly, with but little<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7184-004"/>
                        reserve, he gave free scope to his intense and ungovernable affection for
                        Juliet, when alone with Millicent (now a matter of rare occurrence) his
                        manner was little changed, as in truth the quiet friendship he had ever felt
                        for her remained undiminished. She never caused him any embarrassment by a
                        single murmur, for Millicent Grey was most utterly above all jealousy; if
                        she had once discovered that for Juliet’s sake he would fain be free of his
                        present engagement, she would have given him up at once without a whisper of
                        complaint; but to harass him with a woman’s envy of another, fairer and
                        dearer than herself, was a petty meanness of which her generous nature was
                        incapable. She could not be blind to his devoted admiration of Juliet,—he
                        had himself so far explained his preference, for her society by stating to
                        Millicent that there had existed a friendship between them formerly in a
                        manner strange and mysterious, even to himself,<pb n="4"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-005"/> which both desired should be continued now,—but
                        still she felt that no intercourse in times past, could account for the
                        intense and absorbing interest he evidently took in her beautiful cousin.
                        She felt, with what a helpless sinking of the heart, no words can say, that
                        Juliet must be more to him than any on the earth beside, and yet she
                        believed that it was his earnest desire and prayer that herself should be
                        his wife.</p>
                    <p>She believed this simply because he told her so; repeatedly and constantly he
                        assured her of this, as in fact it was the only salve to his conscience at
                        this present time, that he should bind himself again and again by his words,
                        to fulfill the promise from which his whole heart was shrinking.</p>
                    <p>She believed that, in some way, he conceived it to be for his happiness that
                        he should be her husband, even whilst his very soul seemed drawn to Juliet
                        Egerton,—it might be only because he wished to show<pb n="5"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-006"/> his gratitude to his uncle by fulfilling the old
                        man’s earnest desire,—and when this thought came to the breast of Millicent,
                        it brought with it the very chill of death; or it might be,—and sweet as
                        music was the whisper of this hope to her—it might be that with all his
                        admiration for Juliet’s brilliant talents and beauty, he yet felt he should
                        find more of the peace and comfort of domestic life in her society, who,
                        less gifted and less fascinating, would more unreservedly give her life to
                        labour earnestly for his happiness.</p>
                    <p>It was with this thought that Millicent lived on; hope clung round that young
                        heart and would not quit it. Her own beautiful simplicity and truthfulness
                        misled her in this matter; for, judging by herself, it never occurred to her
                        to doubt that if Aylmer had ceased to look for happiness in their union, he
                        would have come in a plain and straightforward manner to tell her so.<pb
                            n="6" xml:id="VAB7184-007"/> Yet though she felt herself constrained to
                        believe simply what he told her, and to act accordingly, let it not be
                        supposed that she did not suffer with a suffering which no words could
                        adequately render, at the daily and hourly evidence of his attachment for
                        another. With all the glorious generosity and self‐forgetfulness of a
                        sincere affection, it was herself she ever blamed for his unfaithfulness,
                        and all the anxiety which she feared it cost him; it was her fault, she
                        thought,—why was she not beautiful and talented as Juliet? why was she not
                        more worthy of him? Then he never would have brought disquietude upon
                        himself by yielding to the charm of other society than that of his promised
                        wife.</p>
                    <p>This deep humility saved her from all bitterness of feeling towards either
                        Aylmer or Juliet. More and more gentle and patient, day by day she shrunk
                        utterly within herself, and strove only never to interfere with<pb n="7"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-008"/> him, never to annoy him, and but to show in every
                        word and action, as in every thought, that she desired his well‐being only,
                        and was content to promote it as he thought fit.</p>
                    <p>So Aylmer, looking on this calm exterior, believed almost that he had
                        mistaken, when formerly he thought she was endowed with that most fatal
                        gift—intensity of feeling, and solaced himself with the hope which, in his
                        inmost heart, he knew to be false, that she was too insensible to perceive
                        the extent of the new affection which filled his heart, or to suffer by it.
                        How appalled he would have been, could he have looked beneath that veil,
                        which the woman’s pride never fails to draw over her suffering, be it what
                        it may; and seen in what a chaos of utter misery the poor soul of Millicent
                        Grey was wandering now, tossed to and fro from doubt to fear, from present
                        anguish to future dread. She was as one haunted with<pb n="8"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-009"/> fearful spectres, rising from the tomb where all
                        must sink one day, to speak prophetic of its chill and darkness, for
                        disheartening fears came ever gliding in, so terrible and phantom‐like, upon
                        her fainting spirit, whispering with boding voices of the utter death of all
                        her hope and joy, as though they had risen from her future anguish to warn
                        her with a foretaste of it. And when at times, despite the hope which could
                        not be torn from her youth and inexperience—despite her firm trust in
                        Aylmer’s words, the dread stole darkly on her, that even now she might be
                        walking on to the hour, when she should be bereft of all,—of earth’s sole
                        good—her right to be the guardian of his life—that thought came to her with
                        all the horror which a criminal must feel when the sentence of his execution
                        sounds appalling on his ear. For be it remembered that, from earliest youth,
                        Millicent Grey had been seeking to discover that<pb n="9"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-010"/> mysterious satisfaction of the soul for which it
                        craves with such insatiable longing—that fulfillment of the inborn desire
                        which John Forde had called the “spirit’s rest;” and she had believed that
                        this existed only in the blessedness of sweet human love, given and
                        received; and that she had found it in the prospect of a union with Stephen
                        Aylmer. If this, then, which alone contained the promise of joy or peace,
                        were taken from her, where—where should she turn in the bitter cold, the
                        bewildering darkness?</p>
                    <p>It is impossible that the human soul should seek its repose at once in things
                        temporal and things eternal; and since on earth alone she had sought to lay
                        down that head and rest, when earth came to shake beneath her, as it rocks
                        in its convulsion, the far‐off Home of the only Peace had become to her eyes
                        so blended with the dust whereon she lay, that it was too dim and shadowy
                        for her to grasp its promise.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7184-011"/>
                    <p>But as yet she never let her mind dwell for an instant on such a possible
                        consummation. To one thought only did she turn in her sad bewilderment, it
                        was her desire daily, increasing to a passionate longing which well‐nigh
                        absorbed her, for Stephen Aylmer’s happiness, to make him happy, with or
                        without her, by whatsoever means, it might be his wish or will that she
                        should do it. This was her one indomitable resolution; this was her polar
                        star, which was to guide her through all the raging storms and drifting
                        clouds. Patiently she would wait till he should show her how best this might
                        be done. At present he told her plainly it was to be accomplished by a union
                        with herself, and on this she relied; but if the hour should come when a
                        sacrifice would be necessary, there was, though Millicent Grey knew it not,
                        in the generosity of her character abundant strength to accomplish it.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7184-012"/>
                    <p>She was waiting now for Colonel Bentley’s carriage; which came almost every
                        day to convey her to Milton Lodge. Neither the old man nor Mrs. Hartley had
                        the smallest idea of all that was going on at Rookcliffe. He was unable to
                        go there on account of his infirmities, and his sister but seldom left him.
                        The only change they perceived was that Millicent was with them more
                        frequently than formerly. Poor child! they knew not how in her great
                        friendlessness she pined for their words of endearment and of kindness, for
                        they both loved her sincerely; Mrs. Hartley, especially, had become much
                        attached to her; and Millicent fully reciprocated her affection. Yet it had
                        never occurred to her, to disclose her bidden suffering to the gentle old
                        lady. A genuine frankness of disposition, like that which was the great
                        charm of her character, is perfectly compatible with an extreme reserve
                        respecting the inner life of the soul;<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7184-013"/> and
                        this Millicent possessed to an extraordinary degree. Besides, it was not
                        from these lips that there would ever pass a word, which could call down a
                        censure upon Stephen Aylmer. When Mrs. Hartley would ask her how it was that
                        she had become so quiet and so changed, for she was often uneasy at the
                        settled sadness which seemed to have dispelled entirely her wonted
                        cheerfulness and vivacity, Millicent would answer, with a faint smile, “I am
                        growing old.” Then, Mrs. Hartley, pleased to hear her jest, as she imagined,
                        would look with a smile upon her young sweet face; but Millicent, not the
                        less, had told the truth, she was growing old—living many, long dreary years
                        in a day. Once only, Mrs. Hartley, when visiting at Rookcliffe, had been
                        struck most unpleasantly with Aylmer’s manner to Juliet. Her suspicions were
                        vaguely roused, but she soon forgot them when she found that Millicent
                        appeared to take no<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7184-014"/> notice of the intimacy
                        between her cousin and her intended husband, and that Aylmer himself talked
                        of their marriage taking place at the appointed time.</p>
                    <p>It was now within a very few weeks of the period originally fixed, and which
                        still remained unaltered. Millicent was remembering how, when she last
                        walked there with Aylmer, he had been forming plans of taking her to Italy
                        and anticipating her delight at all they were to see. Would that bright
                        vision ever be realized now? Should she really yet go there with him, as his
                        wife, and forget all the horror and misery of these few months, even as we
                        forget some frightful midnight dream? Whilst she thought of it and the soft
                        voice of hope came stealing on her soul, she perceived the carriage which
                        had come for her, winding along the avenue below; it reminded her how they
                        had stood and gazed on that which conveyed Juliet to Rookcliffe, and how in
                        that hour her whole<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7184-015"/> being was subdued by a
                        dark presentiment. She shuddered when these recollections came across her,
                        and turned to the house. She went to find Aylmer in the hope of hearing from
                        him that he would join her at Milton Lodge in the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Egerton met her at the open door of the drawing room, and told her he
                        was there, adding that she intended herself visiting Mrs. Hartley that day,
                        and would reconduct her home. Millicent answered a few words which were
                        heard by Aylmer, and she entered the room alone. We have noted elsewhere
                        that there was a singular similarity of tone in the voices of Juliet and
                        Millicent: it is a common point of resemblance between cousins, and in this
                        instance it was so strong that it was not easy to distinguish between
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer thought it was Juliet who spoke; he did not raise his head from a
                        drawing on which he was engaged, but as he heard<pb n="15"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-016"/> the step behind him, he murmured in a low tone,
                        “My own Juliet, are you come at last? What a dark world this is without
                        you!”</p>
                    <p>Millicent stood transfixed, as one turned to stone. The voice, the words, the
                        deep full tenderness breathing in them, all came to her with a terrible
                        revelation. His <emph>Juliet</emph>!—his Juliet! and what was she? Her heart
                        seemed to stop its beating, her hands grew cold as ice, her whole frame
                        shook and shivered.</p>
                    <p>Words, she knew not how, came dropping mournfully, quietly from her pale
                        lips, “It is not Juliet, it is I!”</p>
                    <p>If a clap of thunder had sounded in his ears he could not have started more
                        appalled. He bounded from his seat, he turned, he looked on her as she stood
                        there with her white half‐parted lips, her stiffening hands, pressing on the
                        bosom so unnaturally still. The blood rushed to his forehead, and a hatred
                        came over him<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7184-017"/> against himself, a horror of
                        the perfidious, base, degrading part he had been playing towards that
                        unoffending, noble‐hearted Millicent. He thought not of Juliet then, but
                        only of re‐assuring her,—of convincing her that he could not act
                        dishonourably; that he never meant to desert her for any other, however
                        passionately he might be constrained to love that beautiful being.</p>
                    <p>He took both her hands in his whilst still she said, with her mournful gaze,
                        “It is not Juliet, it is I!” as though she meant to convey some terrible
                        meaning with those words,—and hurriedly, anxiously he poured forth in broken
                        sentences every assurance he thought would remove the fatal impression his
                        first unguarded words had caused.</p>
                    <p>It was strange that among the various conflicting feelings which naturally
                        assailed him then, the man’s pride most predominated, and his main anxiety
                        was to prove to her that he could never intend to be so dis‐<pb n="17"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-018"/> honourable as to desert her;—first he said, “I
                        thought you were Juliet, <emph>my</emph> pretty artist pupil,”—he laid an
                        emphasis on the word as if to convince her that it was in this sense only he
                        had called her <emph>his</emph>. Strange sophistry of this world’s ways! His
                        terror was that Millicent should call his honour in question, and therefore
                        he acted a lie.</p>
                    <p>Then he passed at once to the subject of their marriage, and the more
                        strongly he felt his very frame shivering, at thought of thus placing an
                        insurmountable barrier between himself and Juliet, the more vehemently did
                        he protest that he would not allow it to be one day or hour beyond the time
                        fixed; that he held Millicent bound to that period,—that he was longing for
                        the moment to arrive—yes, longing. He spoke truly when he said so, for the
                        terror was upon him, that if the delay were much longer, he should not have
                        strength to accomplish the sacrifice. He did long, that it should be<pb
                            n="18" xml:id="VAB7184-019"/> out of his power to fall from the high
                        standard of excellence he had set before himself. And Millicent, did she
                        believe him? There was a natural <emph>submissiveness</emph> in her mind to
                        his, which made her believe that all he said was true as highest truth,—all
                        he proposed just and right, as though by holy laws ordained, and this habit
                        of acquiescence in soul, to his declared will at all times, made her now
                        smile a faint smile in answer to his earnest entreaties that she would not
                        herself be the cause of any delay, and she let her hand lie in his as if
                        with the confiding calm of the promised wife; but all his strong words had
                        not shaken one moment the load that now lay crushing on her heart, and took
                        from her the power of speech or of thought.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Egerton came in and reproached her loudly with keeping Colonel Bentley’s
                        horses waiting so long. Mechanically she turned to go,—it was impossible in
                        her uncle’s presence that Aylmer should say more, but he<pb n="19"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-020"/> held her hand for a moment, and looked earnestly
                        into her face, till he met the gentle, humble look of her large brown eyes,
                        which were so like those of a deer, earnest and mournful. She saw that he
                        expected an assurance in words, that she would do all he wished respecting
                        their marriage, and the instinct of her loving heart made her ever seek, at
                        any cost to herself, to say exactly what would please him most. Half
                        suffocated with emotion now, her voice became distinct with an effort.</p>
                    <p>“Stephen, you know that now and always I will do whatever you tell me is for
                        your happiness.”</p>
                    <p>He let her go, saying he should himself come to Milton Lodge that afternoon,
                        and when Juliet Egerton entered the room where he was once more alone, a few
                        minutes later, she found him with his face buried among the cushions of the
                        sofa, and his whole frame convulsed as it seemed with anguish.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7184-021"/>
                    <p>He rose up, and reproached her almost fiercely for having deprived him of an
                        hour of that only happiness which was so fast flitting from his grasp; he
                        said:</p>
                    <p>“Do not ever leave me—do not, while my life endures, take from me that which
                        is its light of day!”</p>
                    <p>He spoke as if his real life was to terminate when he was parted from her,
                        and only an existence like to that, vacant and rayless, we lead in the
                        darkness of night, remain to him.</p>
                    <p>Millicent passed Arthur as she went to the carriage—he watched her movements
                        at all times with a pertinacity which one less gentle would have resented.
                        He caught one glimpse of her countenance, white as marble, and wearing
                        unconsciously that look of patient suffering which we sometimes see on the
                        face of a child when in bodily pain; he saw her, and the glad smile of
                        exultation passed over his lips—by every<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7184-022"/>
                        deepening shade of sorrow on her soul, the sunshine of his spirit
                        brightened. How fiend‐like does the human nature grow when it is possessed
                        by earthly passion as by an evil spirit, and consents to build its fabric of
                        hope on the grave of another’s happiness.</p>
                    <p>She crouched down in the carriage with that bitterly desolate feeling which
                        makes us shrink within ourselves—she lay in a sort of mental stupor,
                        watching all the trifling objects on the road, and unable to think—she had
                        but one thought distinct—she must do whatever Aylmer wished. But why did he
                        wish it? He certainly loved Juliet—she was bewildered.</p>
                    <p>“My pretty Millicent, what is the matter with you?” exclaimed Colonel
                        Bentley, as she entered. “You look as if you had seen a ghost.”</p>
                    <p>“I think I have,” she answered; for surely she had seen the ghost of her
                        happiness, which was dead.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7184-023"/>
                    <p>“Child, what do you mean?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, nothing; I was jesting. I am only not very well.” She spoke very fast,
                        as if in nervous haste. “I see you are engaged with your newspaper—you do
                        not require me now. I will arrange your cushions, and go to Mrs. Hartley
                        till you have finished. Where is she?”</p>
                    <p>“In the next room; but I would rather you would stay with me; you never
                        disturb me, little niece.”</p>
                    <p>“I will come back to you—but you must let me go now.”</p>
                    <p>She had a longing to lay her aching head on the kind old lady’s knees.</p>
                    <p>“Well, well, go away to her, then; some consultation on woman’s gear, I
                        suppose,—ribbons for the wedding dress, eh, Millicent? Never mind, child,
                        don’t trouble your head about them; it will make no difference to Stephen
                        what you wear: he will feel just the same, I promise you.”</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7184-024"/>
                    <p>She shuddered; what a different meaning she gave to his words from what he
                        intended! She passed into the other room, where Mrs. Hartley sat placidly at
                        work in her accustomed corner. She too exclaimed when she saw Millicent’s
                        face, and asked her if she were ill.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I am not well—I am very weary—I wish so much to sit here—at your feet.”
                        She took a low seat, and placed it beside her aged companion. She sat
                        down.</p>
                    <p>“And now may I lean my head against you?” she said. “I long so to rest. If I
                        had a mother, how I should have rested now.”</p>
                    <p>“My child,—my dear child,—what can be the matter with you? You alarm me
                        beyond measure!”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, nothing,—nothing,” said Millicent, faintly. The tone of affection
                        overpowered her. She could not bear it.</p>
                    <p>“My own dear Millicent, this is no illness,<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7184-025"/>
                        but some heavy mental distress, which is oppressing you, poor darling! You
                        are the very last that should look sad; will you not tell me, love, what
                        grieves you?”</p>
                    <p>She started up in a kneeling posture, and frantically buried her face in Mrs.
                        Hartley’s lap.</p>
                    <p>“Do not be kind to me, Mrs. Hartley—do not be kind to me,” she said; “I
                        cannot bear it; be cold and loveless to me, as they all are; kindness kills
                        me now. I am so friendless—I am so friendless!” Then the pent‐up agony burst
                        forth, and she sobbed with an abandonment it was heart‐breaking to see.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley was appalled, but these wild words were significant enough, as a
                        vision rose up before her of the scene in which she had watched Aylmer and
                        Juliet together. She understood in a moment what was going on, but she felt
                        convinced it was not yet too late. Only yesterday Aylmer had alluded<pb
                            n="25" xml:id="VAB7184-026"/> to their marriage, Still the peril was
                        evidently great, and she must be prompt if she would save that guileless,
                        loving child—this artful coquette should not be allowed to break her
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>Gently she lifted poor Millicent’s head.</p>
                    <p>“Take comfort, dearest, no evil shall come to you. You are frightened and
                        nervous just now, but I will be guarantee for your future happiness. Don’t
                        think me unfeeling if I love you for a few minutes; lie down on the sofa and
                        rest till I come back.”</p>
                    <p>Millicent obeyed unmurmuring. Had Mrs. Hartley been really unkind, she was
                        too much subdued and humbled now to feel surprised. She let herself be
                        placed on the sofa, struggling to overcome her emotion, and the old lady
                        went to find her brother. She wished to give him certain instructions before
                        Aylmer came, that afternoon; but she had rather a difficult part to play.
                        She knew that, if she told him the truth, he<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7184-027"
                        /> would go off into a tempest of rage, and would, infallibly, throw his
                        crutches at Juliet the moment she came into the room, accompanied by a few
                        home truths, of an unpalatable nature. The only way to manage Colonel
                        Bentley, at any time, was to treat him exactly like an ill‐behaved child, to
                        convince him that he was almost bereft of intellect, and that nothing but
                        the most unquestioning obedience to the guidance of others could save him
                        from committing many frightful acts of insanity.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley went and stood exactly before him; she looked him full in the
                        face, he glanced up, dolefully at her.</p>
                    <p>“Sister, you have come to preach, that is as clear as daylight. What
                            <emph>have</emph> I been doing?” His voice passed into a sort of whine.
                        “I declare to you, I took not a drop of port wine at luncheon, and
                            <emph>not</emph> I who let the cat into the drawing‐room.”</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7184-028"/>
                    <p>“No, but there is a great deal of mischief going on, which you ought to
                        prevent.”</p>
                    <p>“Please to explain yourself.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean to explain, that would spoil it all. You must just do what I
                        tell you.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, I am sure, there never was a man so tormented. But anything for a
                        quiet life: give me my crutches, and tell me where I am to go.”</p>
                    <p>“Nowhere, you are to sit still just now.”</p>
                    <p>“To be bullied and driven into a corner, and put out of all patience for
                        people I don’t care about, for I know it can be nothing I am interested in.
                        There is no mischief here, unless you are worrying on about the cat and the
                        crystal vase,”</p>
                    <p>“So you don’t care about Stephen Aylmer and Millicent Grey?”</p>
                    <p>“Woman! what are you saying? Give<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7184-029"/> me my
                        crutches, I say; what on earth has happened to them?”</p>
                    <p>“You shall not have your crutches, I put them away on purpose. Now, brother,
                        sit quiet, and listen to me.”</p>
                    <p>“And what else can I do but sit quiet, when you have taken away my crutches?
                        and am I not dying to hear what you have got to say, if you would only
                        speak?”</p>
                    <p>“Well, you wish their marriage to take place, do you not?”</p>
                    <p>“Do I wish my head to be upon my shoulders, though you seem to think I have
                        not got one?”</p>
                    <p>“Very good, then let me tell you that unless you exert yourself this very
                        day, Millicent Grey will never be your niece.”</p>
                    <p>He made a feeble grasp at his crutches once more, but he was perfectly
                        speechless, from astonishment and horror. Mrs. Hartley was glad of it, as it
                        enabled her to tell him what he was to do, without interruption.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7184-030"/>
                    <p>“Now, first of all, you are not to know what reason I have for saying this,
                        or the meaning of what I am going to tell you to do. It is all a great
                        mystery, which would just confuse you, if you were to hear it till you
                        became perfectly useless. You are just to listen, and do quietly what I bid
                        you.”</p>
                    <p>“I will! I will!” he gasped; “anything not to lose my dear little
                        Millicent.”</p>
                    <p>“That is right; now all you have to do is very easy. When Stephen comes here
                        this afternoon, you are to tell him that it is indispensably necessary that
                        he should go to London no later than to‐morrow, to see your lawyer about the
                        settlements, and that, in order to save you trouble in the arrangements, he
                        is not to come back till within two or three days of the marriage, when he
                        must bring down the license, and having said all this, you are not to rest
                        till you see him off before this time to‐morrow, with a<pb n="30"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-031"/> private letter from you to the lawyer, telling
                        him to hurry the arrangements as much as he can. Will you do this?”</p>
                    <p>Colonel Bentley nodded his head solemnly, in token of complete acquiescence:
                        he seemed still too much bewildered to speak.</p>
                    <p>“And you will do it all quietly, not seeming to suspect anything wrong, only
                        very decidedly, so that Stephen shall be gone before another day’s
                        done.”</p>
                    <p>“Sister, I will; you are very wise, and I will be guided implicitly by you,
                        for this is an awful business. I am in a regular terror. Be sure you tell me
                        all I am to do.”</p>
                    <p>“That is all,—he will be here soon, so take care.”</p>
                    <p>She had gone to the door when he called after her:—</p>
                    <p>“Sister, I am choking with rage.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, don’t choke, only remember well what you have to do.”</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7184-032"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley returned to Millicent who, meantime, like a very woman. was
                        reproaching herself bitterly with unkindness and injustice towards Aylmer,
                        by thus allowing herself to despair of the affection of which he had just
                        given her the strongest proof; when urging their speedy union. What right
                        had she to judge from any thing but his own words, distinctly addressed to
                        herself? Was he not noble and true? incapable of meanness or deceit? and it
                        was but herself whose weakness and folly caused this fear. She had been
                        relieved by her burst of emotion from the crushing oppression which had
                        weighed upon her, and in the reaction of feeling, her generous heart
                        returned to its boundless unassailable faith in the object of its worship.
                        She was terrified that she might have led Mrs. Hartley to think any evil of
                        him, by her apparent desolation, and she struggled to look cheerful as soon
                        as she came in.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7184-033"/>
                    <p>“I am so glad you have come,” she said. “I am sure you must have come so
                        surprised, you must have thought me very foolish, but I am only nervous and
                        ill. I certainly have no right to call myself <emph>friendless</emph>, when
                        Stephen—” she stopped, and grew pale, she could not go on, when she
                        remembered the tone of his voice, as he said, “My Juliet.” Mrs. Hartley
                        stooped down and kissed her fondly.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t distress yourself, dear Millicent, I understand it all. I trust,
                        indeed, when you are his happy wife, you will have no cause to say you are
                        friendless.”</p>
                    <p>These were soothing words to Millicent, and, by the time the Egertons’
                        carriage drove to the door, she was seated beside Colonel Bentley and his
                        sister, conversing with them almost as cheerfully as usual.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Egerton was accompanied by Juliet and Aylmer, and the three between whom
                        so awful a struggle was silently going on,<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7184-034"/>
                        involving not happiness alone, but life itself, sat down together with the
                        friendly words, the calm politeness, which the world demands from us, even
                        when our whole existence is at stake.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer had assumed that wild, unnatural gaiety, which is the surest evidence
                        of a heart most ill at ease, but he avoided looking on the face of Juliet,
                        even as we shrink from letting our eyes rest on the still countenance of the
                        dead, so unutterably mournful in their ghastly rest,—for she was the picture
                        of utter despondency: a beautiful picture still, however, that was never
                        forgotten; and the downcast eyes that seemed weary of the light of day,
                        showed to singular advantage the long dark lashes that shrouded them, whilst
                        the very contrast of her present sorrow with her usual animation and
                        brilliancy, gave an indescribable charm to her deep melancholy. Millicent
                        was so anxious Aylmer should not<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7184-035"/> think he
                        had pained her, that her forced cheerfulness confirmed him in his belief,
                        that she had no great depth of feeling. When he thought of her having heard
                        the words which himself knew to have arisen out of the very depths of a soul
                        devoted to her cousin, and then, when he compared her apparent insensibility
                        with Juliet’s evident wretchedness, he almost doubted whether he would have
                        strength enough to accomplish the sacrifice, which honour compelled him to
                        make to her.</p>
                    <p>It was impossible for Colonel Bentley to speak to his nephew in presence of
                        the Egertons, as an admonitory look of his sister’s reminded him; and,
                        therefore, as the visit drew to a close, he told him that he wished him to
                        remain at Milton Lodge for dinner, as there were some matters of business
                        which they must discuss together. Aylmer looked beyond measure annoyed: he
                        could not endure to lose a single hour<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7184-036"/> of
                        that society which was so inexpressibly dear to him, and from which he was
                        soon to be for ever separated. He remonstrated with his uncle, and said
                        there were various arrangements made for that evening at Rookcliffe which
                        required his presence.</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said Colonel Bentley good‐humoredly, for he was pleased at what he
                        believed was a proof of Aylmer’s wish to remain with Millicent, “I will try
                        not to be too hard upon you, and you shall go back as soon as possible this
                        evening,—but come with me to the next room for a moment, and I will explain
                        to you why you must stay a few hours to arrange matters with me.” He took
                        his crutches, and hobbled through the folding door which always stood open
                        to the other room, followed by Aylmer.</p>
                    <p>Juliet rose, and sauntered towards a table which stood near the door, but at
                            a<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7184-037"/> sufficient distance to make it seem
                        impossible that she should distinguish any part of the conversation, which
                        Colonel Bentley and his nephew were holding in a recess of the other room;
                        nevertheless, her hearing was acute as that of the serpent which discerns
                        far off the tread of his victim. She distinctly heard the old man say, it
                        was absolutely necessary that Aylmer should proceed to town the very next
                        day, to complete the arrangements for his marriage; and, after a long pause,
                        during which Colonel Bentley became furiously impatient, she heard Aylmer
                        reply in a voice of the utmost agitation that he had no doubt his uncle was
                        right, and that he was quite ready to go. He felt that, intolerably painful
                        as the struggle would be, it was best, perhaps, since the effort must be
                        made, that he should at once break from the charm that held him as with
                        chains of iron, and escape from Juliet’s presence, before it<pb n="37"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-038"/> became impossible for him to resist even perjury
                        and dishonour for her sake.</p>
                    <p>Juliet had gained enough. She walked back at once to her mother, and urged
                        her to return home immediately, so as to leave no time for Aylmer to
                        announce his intended journey before they left Milton Lodge. She succeeded:
                        Mrs. Egerton and Millicent rose at once. Aylmer only came for a moment from
                        the next room to say that he must remain, on account of business with his
                        uncle, but that he would be at Rookcliffe in the evening, and so they
                        separated. The red glow of the setting winter sun had prevented any but
                        Millicent observing the ghastly paleness of his face. Her own grew white as

                    <p>“He is suffering,” she thought; “but how?—for what cause? oh! what shall I do
                        for him?” It made her sick at heart to think that one shade of sorrow was on
                        his soul. She felt that she would not have sunk or even<pb n="38"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-039"/> drooped, if she could have saved him from it by
                        enduring herself a world’s weight of misery. But she knew not what to do:
                        she was bewildered. She could but go back again and again to his own words.
                        In what else was she to trust? She had a melancholy drive homewards. All her
                        sense of friendlessness and desolation returned upon her. She felt, by a
                        sort of instinct, that the hearts of both with whom she sat were bitter
                        against her. She could see in the deepening twilight the glittering of
                        Juliet’s eyes, as they settled on her with a side glance of deadly hate, and
                        she trembled to feel so utterly helpless, with such a vague dread upon her,
                        she knew not of what.</p>
                    <p>Juliet seemed anxious to leave the carriage first: when they reached the door
                        she sprang into the hall. “Letters, of course,” she said hurriedly, taking
                        up one or two that lay on the hall table. She had a large correspondence,
                        and never failed to receive some by each post.</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7184-040"/>
                    <p>“Ah, here is a letter from Mrs. Wilmot, at Richmond,” she said, looking at
                        the address of one, which was half hid in her hand, and speaking both to her
                        father and mother, who had joined her as well as Millicent. “I know what it
                        will certainly contain.”</p>
                    <p>“An invitation’?” said Mrs. Egerton. “Yes,” said Juliet, “she wrote to me
                        last week that she expected some of our friends from Milan to be with her
                        this week, and that she counted on me to come and meet them. I shall be so
                        glad.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you mean that you will go, my child?” asked her mother, “that you will
                        wish to go?”</p>
                    <p>“I shall undoubtedly,” said Juliet, turning and fixing her eyes on Mrs.
                        Egerton. “I particularly wish to go just now.”</p>
                    <p>“You know best,” said Mrs. Egerton, satisfied that she could not do better
                        than leave her daughter’s fate in her own hands.</p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7184-041"/>
                    <p>“And she shall do as she likes,” added Mr. Egerton, who was beginning to feel
                        uncomfortable at the manifold proofs of there being something wrong in his
                        household, and who had just sufficient glimmering of what was going on, to
                        feel that Juliet’s absence was the event most likely to restore the peace in
                        which he delighted. Mr. Egerton always thought himself ill‐used when any
                        distressing occurrence took place in his family. Few men had known less
                        trouble, but even now he talked of the loss of an infant long ago, as a most
                        unjustifiable trial.</p>
                    <p>Juliet went to her room, and having closed the door, she deposited the letter
                        from her cousin in Shropshire, which had passed for that of Mrs. Wilmot, at
                        Richmond, in the fire, and proceeded to write a few lines to Mrs. Wilmot
                        herself, saying that, if quite convenient to her, she should like to pay her
                        long‐promised visit now, as she doubted whether she should be able to<pb
                            n="41" xml:id="VAB7184-042"/> come to Richmond later, and at present she
                        had some charming new music, which they might try over together, and many
                        interesting anecdotes from Milan to tell her. The letter was such as to
                        insure an invitation, and she even named the day, in the following week,
                        when she wished. to come. It was finished, and despatched by a special
                        messenger to the post, before she came to dinner. She was glad to see the
                        family all assembled, that they might hear of her journey before Aylmer came
                        to announce his. She said Mrs. Wilmot wished her to go on the following
                        Monday, and that she had written to accept her invitation, so that her
                        departure was quite fixed. Millicent clasped her hands in deep, silent
                        thankfulness; she fancied, in her simplicity, that all the sunshine which
                        had passed from her life when the figure of Juliet Egerton first darkened
                        the threshold of Rookcliffe, would now come beaming through it again,
                            when<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7184-043"/> the fatal influence of her
                        presence was gone. Charles looked very steadily at his sister.</p>
                    <p>“Do you mean to return before Millicent’s wedding?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>“I do,” was her answer, and the gleam of her eyes on the face of her cousin,
                        was frightful in its malice.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer came in the course of the evening. His first look was to Juliet, as of
                        necessity. Her appearance of profound dejection was unchanged; but the next
                        glance, even with anxiety, was to Millicent. This was caused by a few words
                        of Mrs. Hartley’s. She had followed him when he left the library at Milton
                        Lodge, to return to Rookcliffe.</p>
                    <p>“Stephen,” she said, “I would say one word to you!” He always listened to his
                        aunt with deference and attention. “I would simply ask you if you are fully
                        aware what a great peril and responsibility<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7184-044"/>
                        you incurred when you gained to yourself an affection so fearfully strong as
                        that which binds your promised wife to you.”</p>
                    <p>He was much surprised. Mrs. Hartley spoke with a sternness of manner quite
                        foreign to her nature; he felt that she had some deep reason for so
                        doing.</p>
                    <p>“Does Millicent feel so strongly, aunt? It has seemed to me,—I have
                        fancied,‐that she was cold, almost indifferent.”</p>
                    <p>“Lay no such falsehood to your soul, Stephen; you cannot and dare not believe
                        it in actual truth,—or, if you do, trust me, for once, when I tell you, that
                        her life is bound up in her love for you. If the love is torn from her, the
                        life will go with it. Look in her face, and you will see that it is already
                        trembling in the balance. Take heed, the Sixth Commandment may be broken
                        without bloodshed,—murder may be done with no wound visible.”</p>
                    <p>She left him so deeply impressed by her<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7184-045"/>
                        words that he resolved, happen what might, to give Millicent the fullest
                        possible assurance of affection before he left her, and to ensure her
                        looking forward with a happy security to their union. He must lie if he told
                        her he loved her now, but he had become so bewildered in the dense mists of
                        many conflicting passions, that the outward semblance of truth was all he
                        even strove to attain.</p>
                    <p>Before he had time to announce his own departure, Juliet had told him in
                        presence of the assembled family, that she was to go to Richmond the
                        following week. Aylmer started with uncontrollable emotion.</p>
                    <p>“How strange!” he said. “I am likewise obliged to go to London
                        to‐morrow.”</p>
                    <p>He then resolutely stated, though with an inconceivable effort, that it was
                        in order to prepare the marriage‐settlements, and that he should return only
                        in time for his wedding.</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7184-046"/>
                    <p>“Well, you seem both flying off at once, Juliet and you,” said Fanny, who
                        excelled in inopportune remarks.</p>
                    <p>“But you will not be able to escort my sister,” said Charles, with
                        considerable haughtiness,—“she is not to go till Monday, and you leave us
                        to‐morrow.”</p>
                    <p>“No,” murmured Juliet, who had come with her noiseless gliding step close to
                        Aylmer,—“here we <emph>part</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke in a low deep tone that struck on his ear like the tolling of a
                        funeral bell: he felt as if the darkness of night had come over his life,
                        but still the solemn ominous words of Mrs. Hartley recurred to him. It
                        seemed as if in this conflict his senses would abandon him. He could only
                        cling to the recollection of the resolution he had taken. He was to go so
                        early next morning that he said his leave‐taking must be this evening, and
                        he asked Millicent to come and speak to him for a few minutes in the
                            inner<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7184-047"/> drawing‐room. There he assured
                        her of his entire affection with a tenderness and a solemnity which it would
                        indeed have been hard to doubt. The very urgency of the case made him act
                        his part to perfection, for his brain was actually reeling, and he was half
                        frantic with the mad desire to fling her from him, and tell her she never,
                            <emph rend="sc">NEVER</emph> should come between him and his own, his
                        only love. Nevertheless, he left her happy, calm, assured as she had not
                        been these many long days,—smiling quietly to him whilst she repeated the
                        words he dictated to her, containing a renewal of her promise, that on the
                        appointed day she would become his wife.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to her that her long patience was rewarded, and peace was come at
                        last; and though for a short time she would gaze upon that face no more, how
                        blessed would be their meeting.</p>
                    <p>So she laid down her gentle head in very great thankfulness that night.</p>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7184-048"/>
                    <p>When Aylmer returned to the drawing room he found that Juliet had
                        disappeared. Vainly did he look for her with utter despair in his heart. She
                        was seen no more, and the next morning he was to go, without even a
                        farewell.</p>

                    <p><hi>IT</hi> must be a light heart, indeed, that can wake from the calm
                        oblivion of sleep, to begin a new day, without shrinking wearily from
                        resuming the burden of existence, so gladly laid down when the night brings
                        its healing rest. Its peace and radiant dreams are like a foretaste of the
                        repose eternal, and there seems scarce energy to return again to the
                        life‐struggle; but with Stephen Aylmer this feeling had deepened almost to a
                        horror of the light of day, when the morning broke which was to take him
                        from Rookcliffe, and terminate for ever that period<pb n="49"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-050"/> of intense happiness, which seemed to him now the
                        only hour of real sunshine his life had ever known. The struggles of his
                        soul in that dark night had been terrible: now it seemed to him impossible
                        to relinquish Juliet, the beautiful, the poetical Juliet, with her
                        impassioned spirit and her brilliant intellect, the very type and embodiment
                        of all he had ever wished in his wildest dreams to find, as the companion of
                        his journey through the world,—the first, the only one who had ever awakened
                        the strong, mighty affections of his heart,—who had broken up his life‐long
                        indifference and vacancy of soul, to send the deep tides of passionate
                        feeling swelling and raging over it. Yes, to give her up, his living ideal,
                        his reality of love and joy, seemed a sacrifice beyond his strength; and yet
                        he felt it must be,—as we feel that we shall die,—that night shall follow
                        day. It was still more impossible that Stephen Aylmer should be a per‐<pb
                            n="50" xml:id="VAB7184-051"/> jured and dishonoured man,—a murderer, as
                        his aunt had said,—the unpitying assassin of the gentle and true‐hearted
                        being he had called and chosen from out of all the world, to come and nestle
                        by his side for ever, safe from life’s great peril in his sheltering love.
                        This could not be. This alone was dear in the chaos of his mind,—he must
                        keep the solemn oath he once had taken, with her hand in his, that she
                        should be his wedded wife.</p>
                    <p>He went out into the cold grey morning: the carriage stood already at the
                        door, to convey him to the distant station,—it was fully time, there must be
                        no delay,—yet Juliet,—Juliet,—was he never to see her again? It seemed most
                        utterly impossible to go without looking on her face once more,—surely she
                        did not mean to deprive him of his lawful right, a last farewell. Alas!
                        perhaps, like himself, she felt she could not endure it.</p>
                    <p>Still he wandered into every room where he thought she might be, but found
                        that he<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7184-052"/> only shivered at the desolation
                        which her absence caused, in scenes where they had been together in joy
                        unutterable,—and past! He returned to the hall‐door,—his servant said they
                        should certainly be too late, unless they started at once,—but, Juliet,
                        Juliet,—to go without seeing her,—he believed he should never see her
                        again,—he did not think she would return before his marriage,—he thought
                        rather she was going to escape a trial too bitter for her strength,—so that
                        when he left those walls which now contained her, all would be at end
                        between them,—it would be as though they never had met. He felt rooted to
                        the threshold of that house,—a mad device passed through his brain, to send
                        away the carriage and remain. He knew it would be utter folly,—that it would
                        cause the discovery of all his faithlessness,—that Millicent would learn the
                        truth,—but still,—still,—as soon could he let the grave close over the form
                            most<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7184-053"/> beloved on earth, without one last
                        look on the cherished features, as he could have consented to abandon Juliet
                        without telling her, once for all, that, in sacrificing her to honour and
                        justice, he sacrificed all that life held dear. Suddenly he recollected that
                        she was going to Richmond,—then he would see her there. It was decided,—he
                        would have not done so,—thus much of strength he would have had, that he
                        would not have ventured into her presence again, had she given him the
                        opportunity, by taking his leave of her for life itself at Rookcliffe; but
                        it was beyond what human nature was capable of, as he conceived, that he
                        should have gone on through existence without receiving, like a dying man,
                        the last words of consolation from the friend, who had been the star of the
                        life of joy, now passing from him.</p>
                    <p>His resolution once taken, he delayed no longer; he flung himself into a
                        corner of<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7184-054"/> the carriage, and they drove off
                        at full speed.</p>
                    <p>They were about a mile from Rookcliffe, when suddenly a sight met his eye,
                        which caused his heart to bound madly: it was a groom in the Egerton livery,
                        pacing slowly along on horseback, evidently in attendance on some one in
                        advance.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer almost threw himself from the carriage, that he might distinguish whom
                        he was following. He was right,—the instinct of his true affection had not
                        deceived him. That light, elegant figure, that waving mass of golden hair
                        falling on the dark garment, was not to be mistaken. She seemed to let her
                        horse wander at will with lingering steps,—she scarce held the bridle,—it
                        hung relaxed from the fair hands clasped on her knee,—her head drooped on
                        her breast,—her whole attitude was expressive of a profound dejection, which
                        was touching and <emph>graceful</emph> to the last degree.<pb n="54"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-055"/> In another instant Aylmer had flung himself from
                        the carriage, and told them to drive on to a certain point, where he would
                        overtake them; they passed on, and he was at her side, his arm upon her
                        horse’s neck, alone with her for the last time. They walked slowly on; she
                        had not moved, still the head bent down, and the flowing hair veiling her
                        countenance completely from his sight. No one had ever seen Juliet Egerton
                        weep, nor did he now, yet he believed that golden veil hid a face convulsed
                        with anguish. She was the first to speak, but how choked the voice, how
                        incoherent the words that usually rung out so clear and musical.</p>
                    <p>“You may have thought it strange and bold, that I should choose to meet you
                        thus alone, but I had to tell—it is the last time—never more.” She seemed
                        unable to proceed.</p>
                    <p>“Juliet!” he gasped out. Her sorrow maddened him,—she struggled for
                        composure, and spoke more calmly:—</p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7184-056"/>
                    <p>“I have come here to fulfill my promise, that one day I would tell you
                        all,—all of the sympathy that bound me to you, long before your eyes had
                        looked upon my face. I could not,—I dared not,—until your fate was in all
                        things too utterly decided to be influenced by words of mine; but now I may
                        make a revelation, as men do on their death‐beds, for this is the dying day
                        of our friendship, Stephen Aylmer.” He could not answer her, but his hand
                        grasped the bridle‐rein convulsively.</p>
                    <p>“Shall I speak then?” she said in her soft thrilling tone; “shall I try to
                        forget the present, the bitter unendurable present, and go back over the
                        ages I have lived since then, to the bright time of hope when I believed you
                        were a heaven‐sent friend?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, speak,—speak,—were it but that I may hear your voice, so long as its
                        sweet harmony is permitted music to me; speak,<pb n="56"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-057"/> that I may know all I might have possessed, all I
                        might have been!”</p>
                    <p>Juliet lifted up her head, and looked on the landscape round her; she seemed
                        to throw off all consciousness of present events and cast herself back into
                        the past without reserve; she spoke as one over whom glad recollections were
                        passing, like the fair visions of a dream.</p>
                    <p>“Bright Italy!” she said, “bright, sunny, gladsome Italy! as different from
                        the dreary winter scene around as the happy days through which we have been
                        passing from those which are to come, Stephen! When I first went there, I
                        passed through its scenes of beauty and gay amusement as light and free of
                        heart as any on this earth. Aylmer, I was what you were many years of your
                        life, I had never seen one in this world whom my soul could call—friend.
                        Many there were who professed to love me,—many to whom, in truth, I was too
                            dear,<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7184-058"/> —for I must speak the truth now:
                        this is no time for false humility, I must tell you all that really was. I
                        must explain the nature of my existence then, that you may understand the
                        change you wrought in it.”</p>
                    <p>“You tell me but what I heard of you everywhere,” said Aylmer: “I know you
                        were the worshipped of many hearts.”</p>
                    <p>“And I was to all indifferent and unloving. I smiled and scoffed most
                        carelessly at all. I ever felt that till I encountered one whose spirit
                        could meet with my spirit in a communion of thought, of feeling, and of
                        sympathy, I must be alone,—and so I was most lonely, with a very world at my
                        feet. One day, I went to an exhibition of pictures, most of them were by old
                        masters, some few by modern artists. I paused before a splendid painting,
                        which I believed, from its vigour, its rich colouring, its deep meaning and
                        sublimity, to be the work of one who lived in ancient and more noble<pb
                            n="58" xml:id="VAB7184-059"/> times: there was a soul breathing through
                        that picture to which my own flew straight, as waters long pent up gush
                        forth to mingle with their kindred billows on the sea. I fell that he who
                        gave a shape, a form to the noble idea there embodied, could have understood
                        and sympathized with the tide of passionate feeling which was for ever
                        surging up in my own breast,—and when I remembered, as I believed, that he
                        must long since have mouldered in the dust, my heart died within me, and I
                        said, ‘Let me go to dust then likewise, for he in whom my soul could have
                        found rest has passed from earth before I stepped upon it, and a twin spirit
                        like to mine, as his was, shall surely not be found again.’ Aylmer, you will
                        think me mad to have spoken thus of one whom I knew only through the dim
                        faint medium of that glorious painting; but I tell you truth—for I have ever
                        held that doctrine, ancient, I believe, as is the earth<pb n="59"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-060"/> itself, and universal among many nations, that
                        for every soul which comes into this world, another is found to be its
                        companion and twin sister as it were, and except they meet while dwelling
                        here, the same weary vacancy possesses both for ever. I say this old faith I
                        believe, and I felt that the spirit which had conceived that picture was
                        moulded in the same fire as mine, and that none could ever have been to it,
                        what I would be!”</p>
                    <p>“I also believe the same; and I too hold that faith,” said Aylmer.</p>
                    <p>Juliet continued: “The Marchesa L——, with whom I was then living, was at my
                        side, and as I gazed upon the picture, I stretched out my arm to it, and I
                        said—‘Would that I could step back over the ages that have passed away since
                        the hand that traced those lines has mouldered into ashes! Then would I take
                        it in my own and sit down at his feet, and give to him my heart and<pb
                            n="60" xml:id="VAB7184-061"/> soul. Then the Marchesa laughed out and
                        said (I remember every syllable), ‘You need not go so far, <foreign
                            xml:lang="ita">Giulietta bella</foreign>, for if you will walk with me
                        now across the Piazzo, you may take that artist’s hand and sit down at his
                        feet, and give to him your heart and soul. He is a living and a breathing
                        man.’ When I heard that, Aylmer, I thought no more of myself, but only of
                        the glory of the living artist; and I said, ‘He should be crowned.’
                        Instantly all those around me echoed back my words, ‘He should be crowned—he
                        should be crowned as poets and painters ever were, and borne triumphant to
                        the Capitol.’ No sooner was the thought thus brought to life, than the deed
                        was done.”</p>
                    <p>“What! it was to you, then, I owed that day of triumph,” exclaimed Aylmer.
                        Her bright smile flashed upon him in answer.</p>
                    <p>“You remember,” she continued, “how a party of the noblest cavaliers,
                            accom‐<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7184-062"/> panied by ladies masked, came to
                        your studio and carried you forth to receive the public homage due to your
                        great talent; and how one more than all others, closely veiled, presented to
                        you the laurel wreath which the old Italian custom awards as the mark of
                        highest honour; and how it was by her lips and in her words that you were
                        thanked for having made so gorgeous an offering to the <foreign
                            xml:lang="ita">belli arti</foreign>.”</p>
                    <p>“And it was your voice I then heard?” exclaimed Aylmer; “it was your words
                        that sounded to me, then, the sweetest I had ever listened to! I understand
                        it all.”</p>
                    <p>“Not all, as yet—would it were all, in truth. Do you remember, after that,
                        how the Marchesa L—— came to your studio day after day to have her portrait
                        taken, and how there was ever with her one closely veiled, who spoke with
                        you in your own English tongue, to her unknowns. so that we held sweet
                        converse, most intimate and<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7184-063"/> close together,
                        which none impeded, month by month?”</p>
                    <p>“Juliet!” exclaimed Aylmer, starting, as though stung by a serpent; “you do
                        not mean that you were that mysterious friend whose face I never saw—but who
                        so linked my soul to hers, that had I not believed her, as I was told she
                        was, the wife of another man, I never would have left Rome, I verily
                        believe, without her?”</p>
                    <p>“And who told you she was another man’s wife? Ugo Bartoli, who, for my sake,
                        now inhabits a madhouse on the banks of the Arno; for he loved me, and, like
                        all the others, loved in vain. I learned he had told you this, when you
                        suddenly left Rome, without even a farewell. But I took no measures to
                        undeceive you then, for I knew that we should meet again in England—I knew
                        we should meet, because I willed it.”</p>
                    <p>“And we did meet—but how?” exclaimed<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7184-064"/> Aylmer.
                        Suddenly he turned round, with a look almost of fierceness upon her,
                        “Juliet! why did you do this thing—why did you dare thus to sport with the
                        destiny of both of us? Look what havoc you have made of it! Why did you
                        conceal yourself from me? why did you come thus closely veiled, and never
                        tell your name? Think—think, had you done otherwise—had I known you as I do
                        now, of all that might have been! Oh! it is madness to dwell upon it.”</p>
                    <p>“Forgive—forgive me!” said Juliet, imploringly, with that tone which the
                        French so admirably renders, “<foreign xml:lang="fre">Des larmes dans la
                            voix</foreign>;” “it was for a sweet dream’s sake I did it, and I do see
                        all the error now; but, then, it was my darling vision. Listen—I heard of
                        you, that you adored the Beautiful, in whatsoever shape it appeared before
                        you; and I knew my face was fair, I knew that nature had so willed to clothe
                        my soul in a garment pleasing to the eye, that if you saw<pb n="64"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-065"/> me it would be my outward appearance which would
                        draw you to me—but, Aylmer, it was your mind and spirit, as recorded in your
                        paintings, which had bowed my whole being to your influence, and that which
                        I felt for you, as one noble in intellect, great in mental power and energy,
                        filled me with a passionate longing that you should, if ever you loved me (I
                        may use the word now, Aylmer, it can be but an empty sound between us), that
                        you should love my mind, my soul, my inner self, and not the visible form
                        only. For this cause I never let you look upon my countenance, but day by
                        day I sent my soul forth, as it were, to commune with you; and,
                        Aylmer,—Stephen Aylmer, I sought not for your friendship even thus in
                        vain—surely, we were friends!”</p>
                    <p>“Friends!” echoed Aylmer. “Alas how much more—now, at least!”</p>
                    <p>“And then you left me; but, as I said, I knew that we should meet; and when
                            I<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7184-066"/> heard from those at home that you had
                        made your abode so close to Rookcliffe, to my father’s house, Aylmer, I was
                        weak and wild enough to think that so our destiny had been arranged. I
                        thought that I should come, who had made my way into your soul, with but the
                        whispering of my voice, to claim an entrance there in all the power of that
                        fair aspect which I believed was mercifully given me for your sake, and I
                        came—I came—” There began to be the greatest wildness in Juliet’s look and
                        gesture now.</p>
                    <p>“I did come, and I saw you once again: I saw you my <emph>cousin’s
                            husband</emph>!” Her voice changed almost to a shriek.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, what have I to do speaking thus to you! What am I doing here,—what am I
                        saying! Let me go—let me go!”</p>
                    <p>She struck her horse violently as she spoke, and the startled animal
                        attempted to bound forward, but Aylmer threw himself upon the bridle and
                        arrested his progress.</p>
                    <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7184-067"/>
                    <p>“Juliet, hear me,—hear me!” he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Her only answer was—“Let me go,—let me go!”</p>
                    <p>There was the utmost wildness in her eyes, and something almost of frenzy in
                        her tone and manner. With her weak hand she struggled to make him quit his
                        hold on her bridle‐rein. Again she struck the fiery horse, and the animal,
                        furious at the restraint which prevented him from springing forth, reared
                        and plunged so violently that at the risk of Juliet’s life and his own,
                        could Aylmer have alone restraincd his grasp. He exclaimed only in a tone
                        almost of defiance—</p>
                    <p>“Juliet, we shall meet at Richmond!”</p>
                    <p>His hold relaxed; with one tremendous bound the horse darted off at the most
                        fearful speed. He saw but for an instant the flash of her golden hair borne
                        back by the wind; he heard but the rustle of her garments, as though one
                        driven by the tempest<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7184-068"/> went past, and in an
                        instant horse and rider had vanished from his sight, like a beautiful dream
                        which in waking hours we cannot recall.</p>
                    <p>But they met again at Richmond.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> period which elapsed between Aylmer’s departure, and that
                        appointed for his marriage, was well‐nigh the happiest of Millicent’s life.
                        She was so calm and fearless now, living on one bright hope. Aylmer’s words
                        had allayed every doubt, chased away every shadow; in her beautiful trust
                        she received from them the full assurance they were meant to convey, and the
                        storm of terror and anxiety through which she had passed served but to
                        deepen, if aught could deepen, the intensity of her affection for him.<pb
                            n="69" xml:id="VAB7184-070"/> All that her soul desired was centered in
                        the assurance of his. For she still believed that the spirit’s rest on earth
                        is in the love of one beloved, and nothing doubting that this joy was hers,
                        the measure of her contentment was complete.</p>
                    <p>It was for this very reason that Mrs. Hartley now trembled for her. Even
                        whilst her prospect of happiness seemed most assured, this wise friend felt
                        convinced that some heaven‐sent blow would come to hurl her from her false
                        unhallowed rest. She judged not so from any outward circumstance, but
                        because she had deeply studied that Mystery of Love, the chastening of man,
                        which is appointed to draw him out of the snare which his own deceived heart
                        sets for him in this world. She had learnt that when human souls are so
                        allured by the green and smiling earth as to lie down there amongst its
                        flowers, instead of seeking to struggle up the steep and narrow path that<pb
                            n="70" xml:id="VAB7184-071"/> leads to our own home, then straightway is
                        misery sent to drag them through fire and water—the fire of tribulation and
                        the deep waters of sorrow—on to the Paradise above.</p>
                    <p>She saw that Millicent was resting now so utterly in this world’s good,—its
                        highest good truly, but still an earthly treasure only, that she felt sure
                        by some violent wrestling would the cords be broken, which charmed her
                        spirit back from the pure sphere for which it was created.</p>
                    <p>Millicent was much at Milton Lodge. She dearly loved Mrs. Hartley, and it was
                        music to her ear when Colonel Bentley called her his niece, or talked of all
                        she was to do for him when he had a right to her services. Yet,
                        notwithstanding their constant intercourse, Mrs. Hartley never made the
                        slightest attempt to lead her from her delusive rest in this world, to the
                        Sure Repose. She felt certain that a deeper and more bitter teaching was
                        awaiting her.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7184-072"/>
                    <p>To Arthur Egerton also, this period was one of wild delight;—he was with
                        Millicent constantly, and his heart was full of hope: whatever she might
                        believe or think, he knew by the tempest of his own soul, that the power
                        which was now at work in the breast of Stephen Aylmer would, assuredly,
                        sooner or later; fling her out from thence, as the rock repels the bounding
                        wave that strikes against it.</p>
                    <p>A man must have known the influence of stirring passions before he can
                        rightly picture their effect in others.</p>
                    <p>There are certain matter‐of‐fact persons; such as Mr. Egerton, who, being
                        incapable of feeling strongly themselves, are very apt to reason, with
                        individuals struggling and suffering as Aylmer was now, much as though they
                        stood looking on at a man roasting in a fire, and assured him that he was by
                        no means too hot. But Arthur was able to form a perfectly just estimate
                            of<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7184-073"/> Aylmer’s position; and he judged
                        rightly that in the whirlwind of feeling in which his soul was now so
                        fiercely contending, Millicent Grey would be engulfed and lost.</p>
                    <p>Arthur had discerned with equal acuteness the real state of Juliet’s feelings
                        with regard to Aylmer. But he trusted that vanity and self‐interest would
                        make her eager to win him as though she loved him; for she did
                            <emph>not</emph> love her cousin’s future husband,—she felt for him,
                        perhaps, as much affection as her most selfish nature was capable of, but it
                        was not enough to weigh one second in the balance, if her own ease and
                        comfort were staked against it. Her whole conduct, from the first bright
                        smile which she bestowed on Aylmer in imitation of his pictured ideal, till
                        that moment when in an apparent frenzy of mingled shame and despair, she had
                        bounded from his side, had been one splendid piece of acting. The motive and
                        secret of her heartless design<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7184-074"/> was simply
                        this:—in Italy her vanity had been piqued by hearing of Aylmer as one whom
                        no fascination had yet won from a lofty independence, which submitted not to
                        any supremacy of affection. Moved by the inordinate vanity and love of
                        admiration which was her ruling passion, she determined that she would
                        accomplish this conquest which seemed so unattainable, and not only subdue
                        him to herself, but she declared, in a moment of triumph, to the Marchesa
                        L—— that she would gain him by the powers of her mind alone!</p>
                    <p>She had heard of the power which mere beauty could exercise over him, and
                        with the perverseness and personal ambition of a true woman, she was
                        resolved that without this advantage she would charm him, and break down the
                        strongholds of his indifference. In the course of her intercourse with him,
                        which she has herself described, she could not but feel a certain admiration
                        for his<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7184-075"/> talents, and a degree of interest
                        in himself which supplied the place of the genuine affection her utter
                        egotism rendered her incapable of feeling. Further, when she discovered that
                        Aylmer was heir to a large fortune, and devotedly fond of Italian life, it
                        struck her that he was the very man to suit her as a husband. She was
                        particularly anxious to be married, in order to attain that perfect
                        indifference to all trammels which she was quite determined, whoever the
                        individual might be, he should allow her,—and she was also bent upon being
                        established in Italy, where the admiration she excited was quite equal to
                        her wishes, and the whole style of life precisely to her taste.</p>
                    <p>She at once therefore decided that she would marry him; and when, on arriving
                        at Rookcliffe, she found that he was the promised husband of her
                        cousin,—this only gave to her design, and the subtle mode in which it was to
                        be worked out, the additional zest<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7184-076"/> which
                        the pleasure of triumphing over a rival is known to produce in such minds as
                        hers.</p>
                    <p>In truth, there was nothing Juliet so much delighted in as a difficult
                        enterprise of this kind, where she had to exercise her intriguing powers,
                        and that capacity for acting a part which would have made her an admirable
                        diplomatist, had she been a man. As has been seen, she had never for a
                        moment relaxed in her task, and now her design was fast ripening to the
                        ultimate triumph.</p>
                    <p>And this was the being for whom Stephen Aylmer was wildly longing to
                        sacrifice the deep mine of true and noble love which Millicent Grey had
                        offered him! It is often so seen in the world.</p>
                    <p>Millicent’s wedding day was also to be that of her coming of age, and it was
                        within a fortnight of the period when Juliet returned to Rookcliffe. Aylmer
                        himself was to<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7184-077"/> follow in two days, and
                        Arthur felt that the hour was now come when he must rouse every faculty, and
                        exert every energy to further that consummation, which the secret working of
                        (the so called) destiny had so long been preparing. If the course of events
                        did not produce, as he firmly believed it would, the separation of Millicent
                        and Aylmer, he was sternly resolved to accomplish it by other means. What
                        plan he was to adopt could only be decided according to the circumstances;
                        but this at least was certain, that the struggle must soon be over,—now was
                        the crisis,—the crisis of many lives.</p>
                    <p>Juliet returned from Richmond, looking sad and depressed, for it was quite
                        necessary that Aylmer should hear it remarked that she seemed unhappy when
                        she herself arrived. She never mentioned him, however, and Millicent, in her
                        great guilelessness, did not for a moment suspect that they had met. Arthur
                        knew it, however, by the instinct<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7184-078"/> which
                        enabled him to see, in all Aylmer’s actions, the reflection of his own
                        feelings.</p>
                    <p>On the day when Stephen was expected, Juliet received, as usual, various
                        letters, handed to her by her father across the breakfast table. Arthur’s
                        keen eyes detected one in Aylmer’s handwriting,—he admired the coolness with
                        which his sister slipped it unread into her pocket; and when, later, he saw
                        her again, after she had spent an hour alone, he scrutinized her expression
                        eagerly, that he might gather from it some clue to the contents of the
                        letter.</p>
                    <p>He saw that those gleaming eyes were full of triumph, and yet there was a
                        restlessness and anxiety in her whole appearance, which seemed to indicate a
                        painful suspense;—there was, too, a deepening bitterness in the look of
                        deadly hate which she was for ever casting askance on Millicent, which
                        considerably alarmed him. Still, he felt within himself a strength to hew
                        down all ob‐<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7184-079"/> stacles, should even fate
                        oppose instead of assisting him, and he knew that Juliet resembled him in
                        this and many other qualities: he felt certain she was equally determined
                        with himself, and that the grasp of these slender white fingers on her
                        victim was firm as the iron grasp of a tiger.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was to arrive rather late in the evening, so that the whole party were
                        assembled in the drawing‐room to receive him.</p>
                    <p>The Egerton family were certainly rather remarkable than otherwise for their
                        obtuseness, but they must have been dense indeed, if each and all had not
                        felt that there would be fierce work in the destinies of those gathered
                        round the hearth that day, and that the hour now fast approaching, was one
                        which would cast its shadow through many lives.</p>
                    <p>When the sound of the carriage‐wheels announced that he, so deeply loved, so
                            madly<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7184-080"/> hated, was at hand, not the
                        coldest. heart among them could avoid a throb of agitation. Arthur’s hand
                        closed upon the arm of the chair on which he sat, with a grasp of terrible
                        power, whilst with a violent effort he strove to appear calm. Juliet clasped
                        her hands on the cushion of the sofa, where she had thrown himself, and laid
                        down her head upon them, so that her countenance was completely concealed,
                        and Millicent,—Millicent neither spoke nor moved, but suddenly, she knew not
                        how or why, her whole soul seemed paralyzed with the most agonizing
                        terror,—she could not tell what caused it. Five minutes before, she had been
                        serene and hopeful as any on this earth may be, and now it was as though
                        despair had come and stood bodily before her, and said, “Thou shalt be
                        mine!” Juliet’s look and manner before she thus hid her face,—the expression
                        on every countenance to which her startled eyes turned for comfort, all
                            seemed<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7184-081"/> to her as though they knew of
                        something dreadful about to come upon her, of which she alone was ignorant.
                        Meanwhile a slow heavy step was heard without; the servant had opened the
                        door,—he stood holding it to admit Stephen Aylmer, but he kept meanwhile
                        looking back with surprise into the passage, for the guest lingered long on
                        the threshold: at length he could do so no more,—he passed into the
                        room,—the door closed, and he stood amongst them silent and motionless. They
                        all felt as though one from the dead had appeared before them, so appalling,
                        so strange was his aspect; ghastly pale,—rigid,—speechless he remained, as
                        if utterly unconscious of where he was, or what he was doing,—no greeting
                        passed his lips,—one thought and feeling only appeared to absorb him. His
                        eyes had fastened upon the drooping figure that lay there on the sofa, the
                        waving hair trailing to the ground, and the convulsive move‐<pb n="81"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-082"/> ments telling how the heart within was heaving up
                        the aching breast.</p>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Egerton came forward, and welcomed him; he gave his hand
                        mechanically,—his lips moved, but he spoke not, nor had he power seemingly
                        to avert one moment the strained agonizing look. Some one placed a chair for
                        him,—he sat down,—his hands fell powerless by his side, and all the life
                        within him seemed gathered into that gaze, fixed as though the object on
                        which he looked had turned him to stone. It was a most painful scene, well
                        nigh insupportable even to the parties least concerned.</p>
                    <p>It roused the father of the family himself to action,—he made an effort to
                        speak.—“Come, Millicent, you are very slow to welcome our friend on his
                        arrival; do you not see he is tired, come and speak to him.”</p>
                    <p>She rose trembling, and advanced with hesitating steps,—her movement did at
                            last<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7184-083"/> cause him to withdraw that
                        fascinated look from Juliet,—the expression in his eyes changed as light
                        changes into darkness, from the passionate adoration with which they had
                        settled on the graceful reclining figure, to one of absolute ungovernable
                        hate, and thus they glared on her,—on her, his promised wife. When she moved
                        towards him, he shrank within himself, as men shrink with a miserable
                        repugnance from the viper creeping to their feet, and the horrible look
                        stopped her short. Gasping,—appalled,—breathless, it fixed her to that
                        place,—it held her there bound and chained, as it were, to inconceivable
                        torture, like a victim to the rack, then slowly the eyes turned away from
                        her, the sunbeam of love passed into them again, and they became riveted
                        once more with their intense and mournful tenderness upon the form so
                        unutterably beloved.</p>
                    <p>When their spell was taken from Milli‐<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7184-084"/> cent,
                        she was seized with strong shivering from head to foot. Charles saw that she
                        would have fallen, and, starting up, he placed her in his own seat; then the
                        painful, fearful silence fell upon them all again, and there was a few
                        minutes’ pause, During that brief interval interminable ages of misery
                        rolled over the soul of the unhappy Millicent. It was enough—enough,—that
                        horrible look had spoken to her with the most fearful eloquence; it had
                        recorded all—all, from the very beginning—it had told her every detail of
                        the deep love that had risen in the heart of Aylmer for Juliet—it had
                        described to her how this love had grown and strengthened even to madness,
                        so that it had transformed the very soul of the man, and constrained him to
                        hate, even with a deadly hate, the being albeit innocent, who stood between
                        him and the object of his worship. No book written within and without in
                        fairest characters could<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7184-085"/> have told her all
                        this better than his look; and so in the stillness that reigned among those
                        persons, all smitten with silence by the presence of terrible passions,
                        there went forth the sound of one faint gasp—one low sob from the very
                        heart—the knell of a life’s happiness. Then Millicent rose, and stumbling
                        forward like one walking in utter darkness, fled from that room. Along the
                        passages, out beyond the hall‐door, she rushed, flying madly from the misery
                        that was dogging her heels, clinging to her hand, mounting up to take its
                        firm seat in her heart.</p>
                    <p>Out into the dark night, she knew not where,—she fell at the foot of an old
                        oak tree; down,—down on her knees, crouching, her face in her hands,—moaning
                        as the wind moans at night, deep sobs at intervals rising from the breaking
                        heart,—the whole frame shaking as the storm drove through her soul like a
                        reed in the tempest.</p>
                    <p>“Was it come to this! was it come to<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7184-086"/> this!”
                        she cried out at times; “Why was she brought into a world where there seemed
                        no place for her,—surely it were better for them had she never been born;”
                        then down fell the desolate head to the earth, and rested on the cold damp
                        ground. But a hand was laid on her shoulder,—a strong arm lifted her up,—a
                        voice sounded, trembling with violent emotion, on her ear.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, I have long foreseen this hour,—I knew it would come,—it has been
                        preparing these many months,—it is the crisis of your destiny; but you must
                        be strong, you must arise and act; it will not avail you to lie mourning
                        here.”</p>
                    <p>She looked up to him through her long disheveled hair with the most
                        beseeching childlike gaze.</p>
                    <p>“Arthur, I am so bewildered,—I am so lost,—I can scarcely tell what has
                        happened;—no one spoke to me, and yet my. very soul seemed shattered
                        suddenly. No<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7184-087"/> one cursed me, but I came here
                        weeping as though they had,—tell me what it all means; am I dreaming?”</p>
                    <p>“No, there is no dream, but stern, cruel reality. I will tell you all,
                        Millicent, I will befriend you in this hour, and he alone can be a friend
                        who tells you truth to‐night;—take courage then and hear it.” His voice now
                        swelled out with exultation. “It is that Stephen Aylmer loves my sister
                        Juliet as never man, save one, has loved before.”</p>
                    <p>She shrieked out piteously at these words, and writhed as though he had
                        driven a knife into her breast.</p>
                    <p>“Yet more,—it is—that he now hates you for her sake.”</p>
                    <p>Again the scream, the anguish as of a new made wound.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, you will not endure this—you will rise and act; you will not let
                        him trample on you?”</p>
                    <p>“No, never, never!” she exclaimed,<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7184-088"/> springing
                        to her feet with flashing eyes; “but is it certain—where is the proof of
                        this?—he never told it me—he did love me once.”</p>
                    <p>All her long tenderness for him came gushing round her heart, so that she
                        could not endure to admit the truth. She was like a drowning man, clinging
                        to some last frail shred of the breaking rope, who well knows the whelming
                        waters are about most surely to sweep him away for ever.</p>
                    <p>“Do you wish a proof?” said Arthur; “you shall have it. I will bring you a
                        proof that would shake the maddest unbelief—a proof in Stephen Aylmer’s own
                        handwriting: do you require this?—then you shall see it.” He thought of the
                        letter Juliet had that day received.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, yes!” said Millicent, wildly; “bring me this, and when I have seen it,
                        then for ever will I rid him of my presence: never more shall he look on
                            me<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7184-089"/> with hate. He shall be happy, though
                        my life’s misery should make him so. Go, bring it me—here will I wait.”</p>
                    <p>She knelt down again, and laid her head on the root of the tree.</p>
                    <p>“Not here, Millicent, the night is so dark and cold: it will chill you.”</p>
                    <p>“Here! I will not—I cannot stir, till I have seen it. Arthur, do not trifle
                        with me; remember, there is a life at stake. What darkness is like to the
                        darkness of my soul? What chill like to that which lies at my heart?
                        Go.”</p>
                    <p>He saw she was resolute, and went; he did not for a moment doubt that Juliet
                        would readily entrust him with the letter, when she knew for what purpose it
                        was intended, nor was he less certain that it would be of a nature to
                        accomplish most fully the desired effect upon Millicent, even were it but a
                        despairing farewell. The revelation of Aylmer’s hopeless love for Juliet
                        would be<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7184-090"/> enough to raise at once the
                        woman’s pride within her in all its indomitable strength.</p>
                    <p>He found that both Juliet and Aylmer had left the drawing‐room; but when he
                        asked for his sister, Anne told him she was in her room alone. He went
                        thither, and knocked at the door; Juliet called to him to come in, and he
                        entered, closing the door behind him. He had never seen her look more
                        lovely, than as she sat there, dressed in flowing white garments, leaning
                        her fair head against the high‐backed chair of crimson velvet; her brilliant
                        eyes were full of thought; her small white hands wandering restlessly among
                        the long hair that was twining round them. Arthur paused for a moment to
                        look on, and to rejoice, with a fierce exultation, in her glorious beauty.
                        Therein was his hope: this it was that had worked for him so well. Then he
                        advanced to her, and stood before her, fixing his freezing gaze on her face.
                        Juliet and Arthur<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7184-091"/> had never directly
                        communicated together on the one subject of all‐absorbing interest to them
                        both; yet from the very commencement they had felt that they mutually
                        understood one another, and that the wishes of both were to be accomplished
                        by the same end. There is a sort of freemasonry between persons who are both
                        alike delivered up to the influence of evil passions; and Arthur was not
                        more perfectly aware of Juliet’s motives and designs upon Aylmer, than she
                        was of the nature and extent of his love for their cousin.</p>
                    <p>They had throughout felt sure of one another’s assistance in any emergency,
                        because both were conscious of their entire community of interests; and they
                        knew likewise that there was much similarity of character between them in
                        the determined resolution which they had to carry on their own designs, in
                        spite of overwhelming obstacles.</p>
                    <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7184-092"/>
                    <p>Thus when Arthur came to claim his sister’s aid at a moment so critical to
                        both of them, he spoke, and she listened more as if it were the continuation
                        of a direct and open intercourse, than the first breaking in upon the
                        meaning silence they had hitherto maintained.</p>
                    <p>It was not a time for delay. Arthur spoke hurriedly; and he saw, by Juliet’s
                        kindling eye, that her thoughts flew faster than his words.</p>
                    <p>“Juliet, the moment for action is come; all is at stake this night: if we are
                        prompt and vigorous, the game is ours. Millicent requires but to be
                        convinced, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that Aylmer so loves you, as
                        well nigh to hate her for your sake, and she abandons him for ever. Yet
                        more, she will, I am convinced, promote your marriage by every means in her
                        power.”</p>
                    <p>A smile of triumph flashed over the beautiful face.</p>
                    <pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7184-093"/>
                    <p>“But she must have a proof—a certain proof that so it is.”</p>
                    <p>“Poor fool!” said Juliet, with bitter contempt; “did she not see enough this
                        night? Is she not convinced, when his own conduct showed him almost bereft
                        of reason for very anguish?”</p>
                    <p>“Her heart is convinced, but she had ever given a faith strong as that of a
                        trusting child to his own assurance, and her cry of imploring despair is
                        ringing yet in my ears when she repeated that he had said no word to her,
                        and for this reason she must have some proof that indeed his love was for
                        ever gone from her. Juliet, such a proof you have! You received a letter
                        from him to‐day. Is it of a nature to convince her, beyond the questioning
                        of hope’s last lingering effort, that he has deserted her in soul most truly
                        and most utterly?”</p>
                    <p>Juliet’s only answer was to laugh out exultingly.</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7184-094"/>
                    <p>“Trust me with it, then, for this one night, and the deed is done. He is
                        yours.”</p>
                    <p>She looked at him steadily for a few minutes; then rose, took the letter from
                        her desk, and placed it in his hands.</p>
                    <p>“I trust you with it,” she said, “because it is for your own life you are
                        working.” These words contained the ruling principle of Juliet Egerton’s
                        existence; she believed in nothing but that great god, self, which is so
                        worshipped in this world of ours. It was the deity of her own soul,
                        governing her every action, and her faith was, that he reigned in like
                        manner, singly and alone, in the spirits of all flesh. This belief guided
                        her whole conduct to her fellow creatures.<corr/></p>
                    <p>But Arthur had his treasure, and it mattered little to him for what reason
                        she gave it. He fled down the stairs—he passed out into the dark night
                        again. Far off beneath the old tree he could see the faint glimmering of the
                        white garments of her<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7184-095"/> who lay there waiting
                        his coming as men wait their executioner. He held in his hand the
                        death‐warrant of her whole life’s happiness; and had he no remorse,
                        self‐elected murderer as he was, had he no thought but for his own selfish
                        love? his own soul’s satisfaction? had he no horror of the crime he was
                        about to commit? by the will of heaven, the one solitary and adored hope had
                        been killed within her heart, then for her needful chastening, doubtless,
                        was it done; but who appointed him to be its slayer? Oh! at the last hour
                        many that have walked through the world with smiling faces and stainless
                        hands, shall come out convicted as murderers of deepest dye!—each one—each
                        one who has ever destroyed the happiness of another!—and are the sea sands
                        more innumerable?</p>
                    <p>Had the dark earthly passion that twined, even as a clinging serpent, round
                        his soul, so enveloped that immortal being in<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7184-096"
                        /> its deadly coils, that he could be no longer sensible of those holier
                        influences that fail not, in every time of strong temptation, to come as a
                        merciful waning in some one shape or other?</p>
                    <p>Hark! even now that voice from heaven speaks, which, though varied its tone,
                        disguised its sweetness often, yet never is silent in those tremendous
                        hours, when angel and demon struggle for the deathless human spirit.</p>
                    <p>Arthur stood one moment only on the threshold of his home, that he might
                        still the strong beating of his heart, ere he fled onwards to use on the
                        writhing soul of her loved the instrument of torture he would have purchased
                        with his life’s blood; and in that moment, borne towards him by the obedient
                        wind, floating—floating to his charmed ear, there came the ringing music of
                        the sweet church chimes, that, night by<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7184-097"/>
                        night thus told the expectant world that Christmas‐tide drew near.</p>
                    <p>Sweet and clear, chiming gladly, softly, through the thrilling air, they came
                        like faint and far‐off echoes of the harmony celestial that was heard in
                        that Glorious Night of Wonder, when angel voices, loud exulting, filled the
                        high arch of heaven with melody, unheard before or since.</p>
                    <p>Those sounds—those sounds sweeping from heaven on his heart, they bore him
                        back long years to his infant days of deep belief, when in the child’s pure
                        mind the Light Divine reigned bright and glorious, shedding a lustre over
                        earth and heaven, and making glad the tomb which he was taught to know was
                        Eden’s gate.</p>
                    <p>All, all was darkness now—earthly ambition, evil passions, love idolatrous,
                        like foul mists, had arisen to spread in blackness through his spirit, and
                        chase away the beams from the eternal sun; but still the<pb n="97"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-098"/> memory of his early faith and innocence,—that,
                        with the whispering music came,—reflected, as it were, a shadowy gleam upon
                        his present crime, till he was staggered at the sight of it.</p>
                    <p>He passed his shaking hand across his forehead,—one moment he must pause,
                        before he went to consummate that fellow‐creature’s destiny, to seal it with
                        the seal of deep despair.</p>
                    <p>He stayed the feet that swiftly would have flown towards her, and turned
                        another way; he plunged down into the thick plantation, where the wind was
                        only sporting wildly with the dead leaves and the withered flowers, and the
                        angel and the demon went by his side, as he ran on frantically through the
                        deep mazes of the wood; and it was as though both spoke to him with urgent
                        warning and entreaty, the angel, in accents sweeter than ever to our ears
                        the voice we love the best on earth,<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7184-099"/>
                        beseeching him to abandon his cruel and murderous project, and rather, with
                        a noble self‐sacrifice, such as wakes rejoicing in the realms which were his
                        own bright home, endearour even yet to rescue her from the gulf of misery
                        into which she was falling—falling fast. If by the will of heaven who was
                        appointed to suffer all the mortal anguish he was preparing for her now,
                        then assuredly no power could save; but let not the deed be his—let not her
                        chastening be his crime: let him rather, tearing from his own breast the
                        cherished hope, go back to Stephen Aylmer, and tell him what she was, for
                        whom he deserted thus his chosen bride, and what the depth of agony that
                        curdled in the true heart he was breaking. It might not be too late—Arthur
                        might save her yet, or, if not, at least it were a righteous effort. This
                        was the angers pleading; but the demon’s subtle whispering kept breathing
                        venom through<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7184-100"/> his heart, telling him to
                        beware of such a course, for haply he might succeed, and then would she
                        escape him, when even in his grasp. Then would he see her happy by his
                        rival’s side—then would he see her go forth into life the joyous wife,
                        casting back not a look on him, desolate on earth, with but the one most
                        gnawing deep regret for this night’s mad forbearance. Yes, if even when cast
                        out from Aylmer’s heart, she yet should never turn to him, so were it better
                        to see her pining solitary in the world, than know her happy in her
                        husband’s love, forgetting him for ever.</p>
                    <p>Distracted by these contending thoughts, he stood—hearing on the one side the
                        ringing chimes so sweet and solemn, and on the other the shrieking of the
                        mournful blast, whose withering melancholy fills us with such a horror of
                        suffering. Irresolute he stood; the courage failed him to accept the sublime
                        and noble office offered to him now,<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7184-101"/> and
                        to pass from the stormy world of human passions and human hopes and fears,
                        into the serene and breathless region, pure and still, and cold as a land
                        deep buried beneath unstained snow, where the martyred in soul may dwell on
                        earth. He had not strength for this: too wily were the demon’s dark
                        suggestions, and yet his very soul was stirred within him by the sweet
                        pleading of the voice celestial. Not long, however, will the holy powers
                        thus struggle with the spirit that resists them. A certain space is allotted
                        to the messengers divine, and if the pure impulse be not followed up in
                        hours like these, when good and evil demand a choice between them, as the
                        time of grace expires the angel‐wings are spread, and upward soar again,
                        whilst back the feeble loitering soul must fall into the fiendish grasp.</p>
                    <p>It was so with Arthur Egerton to‐night. Too long he lingered, doubting,
                            shrinking<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7184-102"/> alike from the cross and
                        from the crime, so the moment of mercy came in vain.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly the sweet chimes died upon the still soft air; they had spoken their
                        mission to the world, and were hushed again, and with them, like a vision,
                        passed the memory of childhood’s holy faith, and the purity of childhood’s
                        radiant hope in paradise. Only the man’s deep love was raging through his
                        heart—the man’s fierce jealousy and earth‐bound wishes; no sound came to him
                        now, save the howling blast that ever seems like the great voice of the
                        world lamenting for its universal woe, and borne with it he fancied he could
                        hear the cry of Millicent, beseeching him to hasten to her.</p>
                    <p>Oh! wherefore was he lingering here, letting slip the hour when it was given
                        him to accomplish that for which he had been so madly longing these many
                        months? He had no thought for heaven, nor hope within it, and earth had but
                        one good, and that<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7184-103"/> was in his hands
                        to‐night, if llke a madman he flung it not away.</p>
                    <p>Back, back through the tangled wood he flew, no longer undecided, resolute in
                        will, and the demon hurried with him; but the angel spread his snow‐white
                        wings, and soaring up through the soft dark air, took his course heavenward.
                        Again would he visit, perhaps, the wayward soul; but fainter—fainter ever
                        would his voice be, while bolder and more daring should the demon‐whisper
                        sound.</p>
                    <p>Millicent lay where he left her; it might be she had really called him, for
                        her suspense was intolerable. She started up as he came near; she flung back
                        the dripping hair, soaked with the night‐dew, from her pale sad
                        countenance—she fixed on him eyes that were strangely bright and clear; that
                        strength and energy were within her now which ever come to us at the crisis
                        of our fate, however feeble we may feel in its anticipation.</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7184-104"/>
                    <p>“Have you brought it?” she said: her voice was strained and unnatural, but
                        perfectly calm.</p>
                    <p>“I have it—it is here, in this letter.”</p>
                    <p>“Give it me.”</p>
                    <p>“You cannot read it thus in the darkness.”</p>
                    <p>“There is a light—let us go to it;” she pointed to the lamp which hung in the
                        porch at Rookcliffe. He walked towards it, and she followed; he heard her
                        light footsteps, her quick half‐suffocated breathing—yes, she followed
                        him—his heart swelled with a fierce exultation. Already was the charm at
                        work—he was drawing her after him by the power of her despair.</p>
                    <p>They came and stood within the old stone porch; the light fell strongly
                        around them. Without a word, Millicent took the letter from Arthur’s hands,
                        and, standing upright, proceeded to read it through. He had meant to have
                        said so much to her<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7184-105"/> before she read it—to
                        have prepared her to find in his breast the love she had lost a hundred‐fold
                        more earnest and devoted; but he dared not speak to her. So rigid in her
                        determined calm, she seemed to him no longer the same being now—the playful,
                        humble, loving Millicent; rather was she like some dauntless warrior,
                        standing forth in the front ranks of the battle to meet the cannon’s wrath.
                        She read it all—each word of deep unutterable tenderness from her promised
                        husband to her cousin Juliet,—she read that whilst he still must cling to
                        honour and his plighted word,—his longing—nay, his prayer would be, to die
                        upon the very altar‐steps, when once his promise was fulfilled to the bride
                        no longer loved.</p>
                    <p>So she finished it, and flung it from her. Arthur saw that all the woman was
                        in those eyes again, as she raised them with passionate imploring agony to
                            heaven,—in<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7184-106"/> those white quivering
                        lips,—in those shaking hands pressed mournfully on the desolate breast,
                        which no one ever more should shield from the chilling blasts of destiny.
                        His own affection for her rose almost to madness at the sight,—now was his
                        time, now would he comfort her with the intensity of his most undivided
                        love.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, Millicent!”—he bent himself before her in an agony of
                        supplication,—“other love than his awaits you, deeper, deeper than the soul
                        of man hath yet conceived till now.”</p>
                    <p>His words were too wild, too incoherent for a record here, but he told her
                        all, all he had felt and suffered for her sake,—he poured out his whole
                        feeling heart before her, and then he waited her answer, as one sinking with
                        the roar of many waters in his ears, awaits the voice responding to his cry
                        for help.</p>
                    <p>She seemed to have heard him speak;<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7184-107"/> at
                        least when he ceased, she lowered the wild gaze from heaven, and looked upon
                        him. With a startled fearful glance she looked, then letting both her cold
                        hands fall upon his drooping head, she said, “I thank you,—I thank
                        you,”—(each time with increasing vehemence)—“I thank you that you have saved
                        me from being unto him a curse!”</p>
                    <p>With that she turned and fled. He saw her bound through the open door into
                        the hall,—he heard her echoing steps along the passages in frantic haste,
                        and she was gone. And was this all?—was it thus she had received the
                        offering of his whole soul,—the full avowal of his unchanging, unreserved,
                        unbounded love?—with but that wild and fearful blessing, that he had saved
                        her from inflicting pain on that other, not more unworthy than beloved! For
                        a moment his heart sickened within him,—then he saw and understood, that
                        truly her soul<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7184-108"/> was so absorbed by the one
                        thought, the one despair, that no offer idea could have access there.</p>
                    <p>It mattered not, his time was coming. For ever broken were the links that
                        bound her,—a shattered lonely tree, by lightning struck, she seemed. None
                        would come near to tend and lift her up, save him alone. Surely his grasp
                        was upon her! Who but death should make him quit his hold?</p>

                    <p>SHE was alone now. She bolted and barred her door,—she opened wide the window
                        to admit the cold wind upon that fevered brain. There was luxury in
                        this,—she was alone; no witness there,—visible to human eyes at least,—one
                        hour’s indulgence, or her heart would burst. She laid herself down upon the
                        floor,—she buried her face in those convulsed hands.</p>
                    <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7184-110"/>
                    <p>She shook and shivered as the storm of grief raged over her.</p>
                    <p>Many a grave has been dug with tears such as those she shed that night!
                        sobbing—sobbing, heart‐broken, she lay prostrate. Often when the full sense
                        of her misery came upon her the sob rose to a shriek; then died away into
                        that low dreary moaning which has no words, but is the deep voice of the
                        soul most eloquent in its unutterable suffering. So passed the first moments
                        of this—her new existence—the life without hope.</p>
                    <p>Millicent! said we not well when at the vessel’s side you stood and looked
                        exultingly on the boundless sea that swift was bearing you to the threshold
                        of the world you so pined to know—said we not well that could you have
                        foreseen this hour, you would have prayed the whelming waves to take you in
                        their terrible embrace, and hide you in their chilly depths less cruel and
                        cold than human breast?</p>
                    <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7184-111"/>
                    <p>At length for very exhaustion the tempest within her was assuaged: it was a
                        relief to exchange the first gnawing anguish for the settled stillness of
                        despair. Now when the free indulgence of her grief had done its work, she
                        would think what measures must be taken in this her life’s emergency; so she
                        rose up staggering, giddy with sorrow. Never more should her step go light
                        and free on earth: she was aged with the centuries of wretchedness gone over
                        her.</p>
                    <p>She plunged her head and hands in cooling water: she must have all her
                        intellect and strength of reason now. Back must roll the tide of tortured
                        feeling from her soul, whilst she stood forth with clear collected thoughts
                        to resolve and act as beseemed the being he once had loved and chosen. A
                        lifetime would be long enough to weep hereafter.</p>
                    <p>So she was very calm as she took her seat and resolutely looked her destiny
                        in the<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7184-112"/> face; it had a hideous aspect, but
                        she quailed not now, for she was not alone in this matter,—<emph>his</emph>
                        fate was like her own, involved. Most women have a martyr’s heart within
                        them, often no great convulsion in their life calls it forth, as now it was
                        aroused in Millicent; and then it does but expend itself on a thousand
                        little daily sacrifices and secret endurances for the friends they love,
                        most often by them unnoticed even. But when, like hers, their soul has been
                        appointed to the storm and whirlwind, then is it ready, with all its noble
                        courage and its dauntless suffering.</p>
                    <p>She looked, then, into her destiny in its new form, and this was what she
                        saw:—For herself, it was plain that all was darkness now,—above, around. She
                        never yet had had eyes for the light of heaven, and that of earth was gone.
                        The sunbeams of hope and love had fled, and the night had come. His love had
                        made the world<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7184-113"/> where she had dwelt, bright
                        and glorious as some enchanted sphere, but suddenly the earth on which she
                        stood had passed away, as it were, from beneath her feet,—a strong
                        convulsion had rent the ground asunder, the firm ground where she had hoped
                        to walk so happy by his side. It had parted in a yawning chasm, and she had
                        fallen into the terrible abyss, thrown down into darkness and despair.</p>
                    <p>He had driven her out from his sheltering arms, lonely to shiver in a
                        wilderness, now bleak and cold. It needed not many words to describe her
                        fate, now she was desolate,—desolate.</p>
                    <p>But in this shattered life did any good remain? In this most thick darkness
                        was there a ray at least of light reflected? Yes, existence had yet one good
                        within its limit, and through the deep gloom one beam yet strayed,—far off
                        from her, and powerless to warm her poor, chilled heart, as the fair<pb
                            n="113" xml:id="VAB7184-114"/> star that shines, unconscious of our
                        being, in the distant heavens; but still, because the last remaining
                        treasure earth could have, she must devote herself unto it, as we are
                        devoted to our life‐hope, be it what it may. It was his happiness,—this sole
                        capacity for enjoyment life still offered her,—to know him happy, any how,
                        by any means, even in another’s love.</p>
                    <p>That was the one, pale flower that only had not withered, when this night
                        made such fierce havoc, in the blooming Eden of her past existence: all the
                        sweet blossoms that were wont to spring around her feet had perished when
                        her sun of hope went down; and this alone remained to be the object of her
                        care, and deep solicitude,—the last light to live for in the darkness of
                        that desert; so that her existence was now gathered up into this one
                        thing,—the wish, and, as a necessary result, the active effort, for his
                        happiness.</p>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7184-115"/>
                    <p>It was evident that much depended upon herself now—no other, in fact, could
                        promote his union with Juliet Egerton. Therefore bending the strong powers
                        of her soul to this one object, in that hour of calm and dear reflection she
                        saw distinctly, as in a plan rolled out before her, how it was to be done,
                        and his great prosperity, her complete adversity, accomplished.</p>
                    <p>She must do all—she must release him from his engagement, she must gain from
                        him the promise that Juliet should be his wife; lest shame or remorse should
                        deter him, she must obtain Colonel Bentley’s difficult consent; and,
                        further, she must, out of her own fortune, provide Juliet with such a
                        portion, as should enable them to marry without waiting for Aylmer’s
                        inheritance, for she knew that Mr. Egerton had lived too magnificently in
                        early life, to be able now to provide for his numerous family.</p>
                    <p>But further—and this was the fiercest<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7184-116"/>
                        effort in all that task of unutterable bitterness—she must perform the whole
                        in such a manner as that he should believe it cost her nothing. Her life
                        would become one long remorse, if, in this its crisis, she so weakly acted,
                        as to let one shadow from her own despair, obscure the faintest ray of his
                        long‐interrupted sunshine. This were, in truth, to be most faithless to her
                        mission rather, if possible, she must so accomplish it, as that he should
                        believe she loved him no more.</p>
                    <p>So be it; she was ready. She had given, and entirely devoted, her life to his
                        happiness; and if he chose that, not by the love and tenderness of this
                        life, but by its utter sacrifice and misery, the work should be
                        performed—she was content to serve him according to his own desire.</p>
                    <p>One thing only she deeply felt was needful for herself—the whole must be<pb
                            n="116" xml:id="VAB7184-117"/> accomplished quickly—the strength that
                        was within her would not long abide. She was resolute—she had nerved herself
                        to the torture—she had set before her, his good, as the one thing to be
                        effected, and with serene, untroubled aspect she <emph>must</emph> effect
                        it, by the calm surrender of her soul to an anguish that hath no name in
                        words. But the power to do this thing could be found surely for a brief
                        space only! Quickly, quickly, she would do it all, never stopping to
                        breathe—to gasp—working, working on, till he stood firm and secure, in full
                        possession of his heart’s desire; then, when it was done, she would go forth
                        from this place of torture to some far distant spot, where she might lay
                        down her head, and close her eyes, because life would be over—all, save the
                        painful sensation of existence.</p>
                    <p>Millicent did not appear at breakfast next morning, but shortly after she
                            sent<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7184-118"/> a message requesting that Aylmer
                        would meet her alone in the library.</p>
                    <p>The mind of this unhappy man was now in a state of utter chaos; his affection
                        for Juliet, on which she had worked during their absence with a fearful
                        power, was now perfectly ungovernable, and yet he clung to honour, so long
                        his ruling principle, with a frantic tenacity. To desert Millicent, or to
                        let her come as a barrier between himself and Juliet, seemed alike
                        impossible—everywhere insupportable misery appeared to be before him. The
                        scene of his arrival at Rookcliffe showed that his reason was well nigh
                        sinking in the struggle.</p>
                    <p>He knew by the quick instinct of feeling that this message from Millicent
                        Grey boded a crisis; for with his dark night‐thoughts, since last he saw
                        her, had come the consciousness that he had looked on her with hate, and
                        that she had read that hatred in his eyes.</p>
                    <pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7184-119"/>
                    <p>He sat in the library shaking in every limb, when the door opened, and closed
                        again upon her, from whom he had won a life, with the promise of a love
                        until death.</p>
                    <p>She came forward slowly, with that mournful dignity which invests most often
                        the years of widowhood. She had prepared herself for this hour of
                        unflinching endurance: with what torture, may none who read this page ever
                        know! She had studied most deeply the part she had to play; she had composed
                        her features, settled her aspect as we straighten the limbs of a corpse,—and
                        truly her face now was very like, in its deep stillness, to the face of the
                        dead. White it was, and rigid as theirs, fixed in the same indomitable calm;
                        for even as they feel no more, so had she killed, within herself, the power
                        of feeling, till this task should be accomplished. In her breast, however,
                        the viper only slept: soon would it rise to sting her to the heart<pb
                            n="119" xml:id="VAB7184-120"/> with redoubled vigour—but in theirs it
                        should have no venom. She had laid her strong resolution, as it were, like a
                        great stone on the fountain of her tears,—and there was not one now in those
                        eyes,—although not more wildly, darkly mournful is the wintry heaven, than
                        they were, with their deep sad gaze. She had smoothed the long hair on the
                        tranquil dead‐white forehead, and composed each fold of her fair garments,
                        that in her outward appearance there should be no indication of the feverish
                        restless agony within. Meekly were the pale hands folded on her breast,—so
                        very calm, they seemed not truly to be laid upon a raging world of misery.
                        And thus she came and stood before him, a strange contrast to himself
                        indeed, for he trembled and was feeble, as though some mysterious power had
                        smitten the strong man, and taken away his strength.</p>
                    <p>They seemed to have reversed their parts,<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7184-121"/>
                        —the task she was performing should rather have been his to accomplish,—the
                        weakness he was showing, none would have blamed in the timid woman.</p>
                    <p>But hers had been a noble love, and therefore she was ennobled;—his was a
                        cowardly affection, a base usurper in his heart, and so he was a coward now.
                        It is seldom that a man can read the depths of a woman’s heart. Aylmer
                        misjudged her now, as many like herself are misjudged.</p>
                    <p>He believed her to be as calm, as indifferent as her outward aspect denoted,
                        only he wondered to see her look so pale.</p>
                    <p>She sat down opposite to him: he guessed not that she did so because her
                        knees shook under her, so that she could not stand. Then the white lips
                        parted, and she began to speak. Her plan was to conduct this matter as
                        though she were herself the aggressor, in order by so doing to save him from
                        the faintest shadow of remorse or regret on her<pb n="121"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-122"/> account. She would further assure his immediate
                        union with Juliet, by speaking as though she herself desired to see her
                        cousin taken to be a substitute in her place, because she was conscious of
                        her own defection, in abandoning her post as guardian of his happiness.</p>
                    <p>One who had learnt what poor Millicent Grey was never taught,—that all
                        earthly feeling, though it were the most devoted and most pure, must give
                        way, even in circumstances the most fearful, before the one unflinching
                        principle of right, would have felt that not even the unparalleled
                        generosity which prompted this course of proceeding, could justify the
                        dissimulation with which it must be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>But her soul was blinded, because it had been unlawfully delivered up to the
                        human adoration. There can be no pure worship except it be offered to the
                        Alone Good. She knew that in utter singleness of desire her<pb n="122"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-123"/> sole object now, was Aylmer’s happiness, and she
                        believed that through any means she must perform her vocation by securing
                        it, She spoke,—the womanly pride which no suffering, no humiliation can ever
                        eradicate, gave firmness to her voice.</p>
                    <p>“Aylmer, I have come here this day, in order to make to you one prayer,—one
                        earnest request, which, although it involves the question of both our lives,
                        I yet would say in as few words as possible, both for your own sake and
                        mine. Stephen, we have both been mistaken,—you are as fully aware of it, I
                        feel sure, as I am myself. There is no prospect of happiness for us in the
                        union where we thought to find it. I have come to ask that you will give me
                        back my promise,—that you will release me from my engagement.”</p>
                    <p>Thus, while speaking no word that was not true in the actual matter of it,
                        she conveyed the idea that, for her own sake, she would be free. He made no
                        answer, for in<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7184-124"/> truth he dared not speak,
                        lest the wild rapture that rushed through his soul, as he heard the first
                        signal of release, should burst forth into some outward expression of
                        unseemly joy; but her quick glance caught the sudden light that flashed in
                        his eyes, and it caused her heart to throb with such violence, that she was
                        breathless from the intensity of pain. Soon, however, she went on: this
                        interview must be short, or it would kill her.</p>
                    <p>“I know that in withdrawing from you my promise to be your life’s companion,
                        I am abandoning my post, and renouncing the charge I had taken upon me, of
                        watching over your happiness day by day, and hour by hour; and, therefore,
                        you will not think me over bold, if I speak to you now as a privileged
                        friend,—if I confess to you, Stephen, that I shall know no peace till
                        another more fitted, more worthy of your love” (her voice faltered in spite
                        of her‐<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7184-125"/> self,) “till one who may be to you
                        far more than I could ever be, has taken my place, and received your
                        existence into her safe keeping,—you know who I mean,—so beautiful,—so
                        beloved,—she seems destined for you, who are worthy of the best and fairest.
                        Stephen, be generous; give me the comfort of knowing that Juliet is to be
                        your wife; that you are as happy with her as—as I would have tried to make
                        you, and then I will go hence in peace, and you shall never be disturbed
                        with even the sight of me.”</p>
                    <p>He was now so astonished, that for a moment he forgot even Juliet and the
                        bright prospect opening before him, whilst he asked himself if it were
                        possible that Millicent had never really loved him. He could not conceive
                        the possibility of such generosity, as she was in real fact displaying, and
                        the man’s vanity was actually piqued. Juliet had of late striven earnestly
                        to convince him, that Millicent was by no means in‐<pb n="125"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-126"/> different to Arthur, whose affection for her was
                        evident to all, and she had done this none the less eloquently, that she
                        well knew how absolutely false it was. Aylmer remembering the past, could
                        not believe it; but now it seemed to him as though it must certainly be as
                        that lying voice had said. He felt it would be the most intense relief,
                        could he know that it was so indeed; and, speaking for the first time, he
                        said eagerly:—</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, one thing you will admit I have a right to know, even in this
                        hour,—Have you, indeed, never loved me?—or rather,—let us not touch the
                        past, it is sacred,”—there was some emotion in his tone, as he thought on
                        the days when her deep tenderness was displayed so brightly to his eyes that
                        he might as well have doubted the clear light of heaven,—“but tell me that
                        which affects the present and the future,—do you love me no longer?”</p>
                    <p>What a question! It had been less<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7184-127"/> bitter
                        for her to die, than to give him the assurance for which she saw that he was
                        craving, as men crave for the life itself, when they have been near unto
                        death. Yes, to know that she loved him no longer would be to him, the
                        perfect happiness she so longed to procure him,—here was then the moment,
                        when she was to accomplish his peace and joy, with her entire devotion; the
                        sacrifice of her whole life was gathered up into the sentence she was next
                        to utter. It <emph>must</emph> be the assurance he demanded; but how, even
                        if she risked the falsehood, could her lips pronounce it, when the very
                        heart within her was swelling, dying with the excess of its intense love for
                        him? But she would not fail, she who had done so much for him, in this, the
                        last momentous hour! She nerved herself to one tremendous effort,—this was
                        her answer: he had said, “Do you love me no longer?” and she replied:</p>
                    <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7184-128"/>
                    <p>“<emph>Juliet does</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>It was quite enough; he never doubted but that, unwilling to pronounce the
                        actual confession that she had in heart deserted him, Millicent by this
                        means sought to convey to him not only the assurance that in truth she did
                        love him no more, but that Juliet had given him all that affection which she
                        had taken away. What words could express the boundless joy that came to him
                        with this conviction!—he could no longer restrain his passionate
                        delight,—and why should he in truth? He believed that Millicent was as
                        thankful as himself to be released!</p>
                    <p>All embarrassment, all gloom, all fear, passed away from his countenance. He
                        rose up radiant with happiness; as if a new life were in him.</p>
                    <p>“Then,” he exclaimed, “if so it is, if you love me no more—and Juliet does
                        with all the tenderness, I doubt not, of her impassioned, generous
                            nature—then,<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7184-129"/> indeed, do I thank you
                        for thus frankly putting an end to all idea of the union, which would have
                        made us both so wretched. Yes, Millicent, and if your kind heart would seek
                        the assurance of my happiness before you can enjoy that which you will so
                        much better secure to yourself without me, I can give it to you most
                        fully—for I shall, indeed, find it abundantly in her love. If she has given
                        me her affection, I know well how deep, how true, how fervent it will be.
                        Kind friend as you are, thus to care for my welfare, you may safely trust it
                        in sweet Juliet’s keeping. I know what a depth of tenderness is in her soul,
                        and she will watch and tend the life of him she loves, as none, I believe,
                        on earth could do.”</p>
                    <p>In what inquisition had he learned to be such a torturer? It was most awful
                        to her to see how well she had performed her work. Alas! alas! to think that
                            he<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7184-130"/> should dream that Juliet’s love and
                        Juliet’s care, could ever be what hers had been and was even now! It was a
                        terrible thing to see the joy with which he at once assumed that she loved
                        him not, who, for his sake, could no longer endure existence. It was
                        impossible for her to continue this insupportable scene: she rose up,
                        confused and faint with the dreary bewilderment of her soul. The blinding
                        tears were rushing to her eyes, her voice was choked, her words most
                        incoherent.</p>
                    <p>“Then there is no need to say more—it is all fixed, all settled. I think we
                        have arranged everything—I mean for the future—for your life—for mine. Oh,
                        what am I saying!”</p>
                    <p>He did not so much as see her agitation, he was so mad with joy.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, it is all settled! Think no more of it, Millicent—have no remorse, no
                            fear!<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7184-131"/> All is well—most well, indeed! I
                        will go to Juliet!”</p>
                    <p>It was Juliet—Juliet ever with him now; her image absorbed all other
                        thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Weary, faint, bowed to the very ground, Millicent crept to the door; it
                        seemed to her that now it was not required of her to live any longer. Then
                        she remembered that her task was not done yet, not nearly done. She turned
                        round to him again: her tones were now very low and faltering.</p>
                    <p>“Stephen, I have one more favour to ask! It seems to me that you may meet
                        with many difficulties—that there will be much opposition to your marriage
                        with Juliet. I think that I could remove them all if you will let me, if you
                        will have no scruple. It will be happiness, yes, happiness, to promote
                        yours. Juliet has no fortune: my uncle and aunt, and Colonel Bentley, might
                        object; do not undertake<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7184-132"/> any unpleasant
                        discussions with them yourself, let me arrange it all.”</p>
                    <p>He hardly understood that she meant to carry her generosity even to the
                        extent of providing Juliet with a portion, but her words reminded him that,
                        in truth, it would be no easy matter to satisfy the various parties
                        concerned in this change, and that most certainly none but Millicent herself
                        could effect it.</p>
                    <p>He felt, therefore, deeply grateful to her for thus completing his happiness
                        for him, even whilst he was confident that she did so in expiation of her
                        own faithlessness.</p>
                    <p>“You are right, Millicent; there will, indeed, be difficulties which no one
                        but yourself can overcome. You only can bring matters to a happy conclusion;
                        and I do gladly and gratefully trust all to you. Blessings on you for the
                        thought!”</p>
                    <p>That blessing broke her heart: she could endure no more, but rushed from
                            him.<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7184-133"/> It seemed the last effort of her
                        strength, and, unable to advance, she leant against the wall in the passage,
                        and gasped out, faintly:—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, death! oh, death! come quickly! Be merciful—come quick, and take
                        me!”</p>
                    <p>Perhaps death would have been, indeed, more merciful than he whose selfish
                        love now exulted over her final despair. Arthur, ever at hand, took her
                        gently in his arms, and carried her to the next room, where he placed her on
                        a sofa, near the open window; the cold air revived her at once, for she had
                        not fainted.</p>
                    <p>She tried vainly with her pale, quivering lips to thank him, but her
                        beseeching eyes told him she would be alone; he bent down, and kissed one of
                        the folds of her dress, and then left the room. When he was gone she turned
                        away from the light, and hid her face, with one long, deep sigh.</p>

                    <p><hi>MILLICENT GREY</hi> did not rest long; repose in truth, there could never
                        more be for her, under the same roof with Stephen Aylmer. Her whole longing
                        now was to escape from that place, to fly and hide herself in some far
                        distant spot, where she should never see the face, or hear the voice of any
                        one of those who had been with her in her days of joy, for ever gone. Her
                        resolution with regard to her own fate, had been fully taken, so soon as she
                        decided upon aban‐<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7184-135"/> doning Aylmer. She
                        would return without delay to Aix to poor John Forde, who had of late more
                        than once written, expressing a wish to see her, and with whose mournful
                        devotion to the dead,—whose passionate love for the mouldering ashes, she
                        felt she now could deeply sympathize. In a few days she would be of age, and
                        at liberty to leave England. She determined to take her departure on the
                        very day that was to have seen her the wife of Juliet’s future husband.
                        Alas! her vows of life‐long faithfulness and tender love were taken long
                        ago, and she repeated them even yet in the deep of her heart, for she was
                        learning now that sad mysterious truth, that an affection such as hers can
                        feed even upon despair.</p>
                    <p>For the few intervening days she would go to Milton Lodge: to sleep another
                        night at Rookcliffe was most utterly impossible. To be the witness of their
                        happy love,<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7184-136"/> would be to make the
                        bitterness of her own miserable desolation beyond the power of human
                        strength to bear.</p>
                    <p>In truth, she dared not trust herself so much as to look upon his face again;
                        she trembled at the wild longing that rose in her breast,—to fly back to him
                        even then, to pour out the depths of her soul to him,—to tell him that none,
                        none upon this earth could ever love him as she did,—that although she never
                        saw him more, he must for ever be to her, the all of life, and hope, and
                        joy. Yes, she panted to tell him this, at the very moment, no doubt, when he
                        stood by the side of Juliet, and rejoiced with her in evident rapture, that
                        he was free from a detested bondage.</p>
                    <p>Oh! how this thought stung her to the quick; it roused her into action! She
                        must up and complete the work that yet remained; she must toil on, on,
                        unceasing, till her task was accomplished; she felt<pb n="136"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-137"/> as though a strong power was goading her to that
                        labour, till his entire happiness was secured, and not a thorn lay in his
                        path.</p>
                    <p>She rose, and went at once to Mr. and Mrs. Egerton; her task with them was
                        very easy. They were fully prepared for her coming,—the scene of last night,
                        her interview with Aylmer, and now the fact of which they were aware, that
                        he was sitting at Juliet’s side, as her future husband, sufficiently
                        explained the nature of Millicent’s mission. They had arranged their tactics
                        with great ability. They said they had long perceived that Millicent and
                        Aylmer were <emph>mutually</emph> indifferent to one another—indeed, as it
                        was purely a <foreign xml:lang="fre">marriage de convenance</foreign>,
                        arranged by Colonel Bentley, it could scarcely be otherwise; and it was
                        perfectly natural that when Juliet and Aylmer met, who were so well suited
                        to one another, they should have formed an attachment. There was a certain
                        indefinable feeling<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7184-138"/> which prevented either
                        of them from glancing at Millicent whilst they spoke all these cold,
                        calculating speeches: had they looked on that wan face, they would have
                        ceased for very pity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Egerton could not help wincing a little when he found that she designed
                        to give Juliet a positive fortune: she implored of him so earnestly to allow
                        her what she said was her great happiness, and he was in truth so much
                        embarrassed how to provide for his daughter, that at last, with a
                        patronizing delight, he consented, assuring Millicent he only did so,
                        because she said he could not refuse to let her make a wedding present to
                        her cousin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Egerton found the whole of their niece’s communication extremely
                        pleasant, but that which put the climax to their satisfaction was her
                        declaring it to be her intention to return for some time to Aix. This would
                        so effectually prevent all<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7184-139"/> embarrassment
                        and awkwardness that they could not resist letting her see how highly they
                        approved of her plan, and equally of her more immediate arrangement, in
                        leaving Rookcliffe for Milton Lodge. They had been thinking with much horror
                        of the unmanageable Colonel Bentley, and were inexpressibly relieved to find
                        him taken off their hands, and to receive Millicent’s assurance, that she
                        would obtain his consent to Aylmer’s marriage with Juliet.</p>
                    <p>At her niece’s request Mrs. Egerton at once ordered the carriage to convey
                        her to Milton Lodge, and promised to come with her daughters to take leave
                        of her before she left England. They did not fail to assure her of their
                        earnest desire that she should soon return to live with them, but their
                        words seemed to fall utterly meaningless on her ear, for she was struggling
                        with her own failing strength, to gain courage, thus to quit the place where
                            the<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7184-140"/> summer time of her life had passed
                        with its redeemless brightness.</p>
                    <p>Two hours had not elapsed from the time when she passed, in all her agony,
                        from Aylmer’s sight, before she crossed the threshold of Rookcliffe for
                        ever. She heard the murmur of his voice as she passed the studio, and
                        shivered with the strong spasm that grasped her heart at the sound; but her
                        attention was almost instantly claimed by Arthur, who stood in the hall,
                        still triumphant, though, in spite of himself, almost terrified at what he
                        had done.</p>
                    <p>He could not remain unmoved when he felt that he himself had been the means
                        of driving her from her home, and casting her out for ever from the only
                        happiness she had ever known. He had not expected this abrupt departure, and
                        it alarmed him for his own future plans. He seized her hand, and
                        exclaimed,</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Millicent, what is it you mean to do? where are you going?”</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7184-141"/>
                    <p>She turned round to him with a wild, unnatural look in her eyes, whilst a
                        strange smile passed over her lips.</p>
                    <p>“Where am I going? Drifting down with the current, Arthur,—the current that
                        flows to the deep, deep sea, where the dead have gone to their rest. Who can
                        arrange his own destiny, or tell what it shall be? Do you not know we are
                        all at the mercy of the waves on that fierce stream of life: for some, it
                        has smooth waters, and they go safely down; but there are others whom the
                        stormy billows seize and dash against the rocks, and there they perish,
                        Arthur.” She flung back his hand as she spoke, and sprung into the carriage,
                        leaving him with the terrible fear that her very reason was shaken by the
                        intensity of her suffering.</p>
                    <p>As for Millicent, she snatched up, with a sort of frantic haste, a large
                        shawl, that lay on the seat, and wrapped her head in it entirely, so as to
                        shut out all sight and<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7184-142"/> sound, while the
                        carriage rolled away from Rookcliffe and from him for ever—lost, and yet not
                        less, for ever dear.</p>
                    <p>It was bitter to be roused anew to the conflict when she reached Milton
                        Lodge; but concentrating all her thoughts on the prospect of that hour of
                        rest, when she should quit England, she gathered up anew her strength, and
                        proceeded at once to seek Mrs. Hartley, There was a sort of instinct which
                        made her feel that here she would be thoroughly understood; that she need
                        enter into no explanations, nor yet attempt to conceal the reality of her
                        unutterable sacrifice. She felt, indeed, from many words of Mrs. Hartley’s,
                        only now remembered, that she had known the truth long since, and that she
                        would appreciate to the uttermost all Millicent had done and suffered.</p>
                    <p>The good old lady sat reading by the window. Millicent gently crept towards
                        her and knelt down before her. One look passed<pb n="142"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-143"/> between them, and Mrs. Hartley read all that had
                        taken place, in the expression of intolerable anguish which that sweet young
                        face now bore; then Millicent laid her head upon her kind friend’s lap, and
                        said, in a low, suffocated voice:—</p>
                    <p>“Dear kind friend, it is all over. I never, never more shall have a right to
                        comfort him, or bless him with my whole heart’s love; I never, never shall
                        look upon his face again. How shall I bear it?—my very soul seems dying in
                        me! Oh, that she, at least, may love him, not as I did, that cannot be, but
                        so that he shall be happy!”—She could not go on. Mrs. Hartley was deeply
                        moved, and yet this was but the hour that she had long foreseen. She saw
                        that as she had expected, a message had come from Heaven to the soul of
                        Millicent Grey, to tell her that she had mistaken her rest and her
                        vocation—that her rest could not be in this world, nor the vocation of her
                            immortal<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7184-144"/> spirit to worship a human
                        being or any other earthly thing. The messenger was dark and stern truly;
                        and sharp the sword with which he had pierced that heart, to disengage it
                        from the dust and clay to which it clung; but Mrs. Hartley knew that he was
                        not the less an angel of mercy, and that in time the dim eyes of poor
                        Millicent, made clearer by their bitter tears, would discern the glory of
                        his countenance, and the radiance of the snow‐white wings that soon would
                        bear her up to heaven.</p>
                    <p>She laid her hands on the poor drooping head that rested on her knees.</p>
                    <p>“Darling, I have long foreseen this hour; but take comfort. By this very
                        suffering shall a sweeter shelter be provided for you than any human love—a
                        happier home, my child, than any dwelling even with the most beloved—”</p>
                    <p>These words, were strangely soothing to poor Millicent, although she scarcely
                            under‐<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7184-145"/> stood them. She gave one low
                        sobbing sigh; and then lay still, exhausted by that fainting of the spirit,
                        which has no strength for tears, scarce even for thought. But soon the
                        goading recollection roused her that her work was not yet accomplished, that
                        his happiness was not altogether secured, and she felt guilty to be resting
                        even in her very desolation. She lifted up her poor wan face, the heavy eyes
                        so full of the sad bewilderment of sorrow, and entreated of Mrs. Hartley to
                        assist her in the task which yet remained, the obtaining of Colonel
                        Bentley’s consent to his nephew’s marriage with Juliet, nor get his consent
                        only, but his willing approbation and his promise that Aylmer should not the
                        less be his heir, that he had failed to meet his wishes respecting
                        Millicent.</p>
                    <p>She said there must be no delay in this matter, for she had sent a message to
                        Stephen by Mr. Egerton, promising, that if<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7184-146"/>
                        possible, he should have his uncle’s consent that very evening, for she well
                        knew how deep must be his anxiety, to obtain the full assurance of that on
                        which in part his union must depend.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley at once proposed to undertake the mission, and said she would go
                        to her brother that very moment, trusting earnestly that she might be able
                        to prevail with him, so that it should not be requisite for her to call on
                        poor Millicent to come and plead with him for her own despair. With one fond
                        pitying kiss she left her unhappy charge, who remained still crouching on
                        the floor, her hands clasped over her eyes; for when the heart is crushed as
                        hers was now, it seems impossible for the feeble knees to uphold the weary
                        frame, or the heavy head to lift itself from the dust where most it is
                        content to dwell.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley had anticipated a scene of violence with her brother, and much
                            vehe‐<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7184-147"/> ment opposition to Aylmer’s
                        marriage, but the reality far exceeded her expectation; not only did he pour
                        forth a storm of invective against Juliet, Aylmer, and the whole Egerton
                        family, but he reproached even Millicent herself, and solemnly declared that
                        he would disinherit his nephew forthwith, unless she became his wife on the
                        day appointed.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley soon saw that she was quite powerless, and that the fiery
                        scourge which had driven Millicent Grey to the accomplishment of all she had
                        that day done, would not relax its cruel work till the whole of her bitter
                        task should be fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>She went and brought her to Colonel Bentley; he was in the full paroxysm of
                        ungoverned rage, his angry passions excited to the uttermost;—his powerless
                        limbs quivered with the internal violence—his features were distorted—his
                        voice, harsh and discordant, was uttering fierce words of menace. Then she
                        came gliding in with<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7184-148"/> face so pale, stamped
                        with the holy seal of sufferings—for she had accepted the agony of this last
                        effort with the patient meekness of entire self‐devotion, and the soft
                        submissive hands were folded on the torn and throbbing heart.</p>
                    <p>As the old man looked on her the angry tones died away on his lips, the stir
                        of the human feelings seemed hushed within him as though by the presence of
                        a thing unearthly. His fascinated gaze followed her movements. She came and
                        knelt before him, for it seemed the only attitude in which she now found any
                        rest. Very humble does intense love and intense suffering make us!</p>
                    <p>Then she lifted up the wan burning hands, and began to plead for Aylmer’s
                        happiness and her own entire misery, with an eloquence of supplication which
                        these weak words cannot render.</p>
                    <p>No mother, wrestling in agony for the life of her first‐born child, ever
                        found such<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7184-149"/> power of beseeching prayer as
                        rose in wailing entreaty from that broken heart.</p>
                    <p>She entered into no explanation as to what had passed—she gave no reason for
                        thus seeking to place an irrevocable barrier between herself and him who had
                        been the hope of this mortal life, only she said it was for his happiness,
                        and she prayed the old man by the dear name of mercy, to grant her deep
                        petition. She laid down her head upon his feet, and said she would not rise
                        till he had promised to send forth a blessing on that friend beloved, peace
                        to his heart, and the offering of the crowning cup of joy unto his lips. For
                        herself, she said if he would hear her prayer, she would in return devote
                        her life to him—she would come back to him when <emph>they</emph> were gone,
                        and be to him a child, a niece, seeking with the care and devotedness of
                        years, to repay him for his goodness and mercy to her, this day granted; and
                        the old man’s heart<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7184-150"/> melted within him at
                        the sound of that sweet intensely‐mournful supplication. The dark passion
                        passed from his soul as the thunder cloud yields to the soft wind’s breath;
                        he could not tell why, his own will and wishes had lost all power to
                        influence him, so that now he could act by hers alone, but so it was, and he
                        only longed to assure her he would do all and everything she wished. His
                        arms fell around her, the tears came thick into his eyes, he muttered
                        hoarsely, “My poor child, I will do all you desire;” and when at these
                        words, she rose and smiled on him in her deep gratitude, the sweetness and
                        the sadness of that smile was all too much; he bowed, his head upon his
                        breast and wept.</p>
                    <p>There was no further delay, Colonel Bentley wrote the letter to his nephew
                        instantly; it was dictated by Millicent herself, and it breathed only love
                        and kindness, and the promise that all should be done to<pb n="150"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-151"/> ensure his happiness. With her own hands she
                        carried it to the messenger who was to convey it to Rookcliffe, and when all
                        was thus completed—terminated for ever—she allowed Mrs. Hartley to lay her
                        down and compose her limbs in the attitude of repose; there she became in
                        truth, like to the corpse of one whose hour of rest is come; and for many
                        hours her friend sat moistening her white lips with cooling water, doubting
                        almost whether the very life had not expired in her heart.</p>
                    <p>But the life was still there, the strong life turned to poison; and when
                        morning broke, Millicent rose and made ready as for a journey. She told Mrs.
                        Hartley, that great as had been her strength for endurance hitherto, she
                        felt now there was a limit, beyond which the power of submission unto
                        suffering could not go. To see again the faces of those who had been around
                        her in her days of deep joy—to risk the mention<pb n="151"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-152"/> of his name, whose image was eating like canker
                        into her soul was, she said, beyond the human nature to endure. She had
                        decided on going to London that very day, and hence sailing for Aix as soon
                        as might be.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley felt she was right, and that it was better for all parties that
                        so it should be; she undertook to explain this very sudden departure to the
                        Egertons, who, she felt convinced, would be thankful if such an arrangement
                        were made; and in a very few hours Millicent was on her way to London,
                        accompanied by Nanette and her servant. Thence a week later she departed for
                        Aix.</p>
                    <p>As Mrs. Hartley anticipated, the family at Rookcliffe were greatly relieved
                        at having her, who was in truth their victim, removed from before their eyes
                        thus happily; and as Millicent came of age during her stay in London, all
                        necessary arrangements were there made with the lawyers, to<pb n="152"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-153"/> terminate Mr. Egerton’s guardianship, and leave
                        her to act as she pleased, and to reside where she would.</p>
                    <p>From the moment of her departure all seemed to prosper according to their
                        wishes. Aylmer, with the full consent of his uncle, hurried the preparations
                        for his marriage with Juliet, which was already announced to the world; and
                        in the delicious joy of having obtained that good, without which it had
                        seemed so impossible to live, and of which he had despaired, he drove from
                        him all thought of the past, and resolutely closed the eyes of his soul upon
                        the mournful figure, whose image, at times, would steal across his spirit,
                        looking up at him with sad reproaching eyes, and mutely wringing her pale
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>There was one, however, to whom the news of Millicent Grey’s sudden departure
                        was for a moment quite paralyzing; but gradually a little reflection taught
                        him that<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7184-154"/> it was rather a matter of
                        rejoicing to him—for who should prevent his walking in her shadow
                        wheresoever she went—down into the very grave itself, would he not follow
                        her? Yes! she was gone, but how? gone an outcast from earth’s affection,
                        desolate as those are only, who having trusted their life and soul to human
                        hands, have seen them shattered and for ever ruined in that ruthless grasp!
                        The fair plant of living hoping love, that had sprung up and flourished in
                        her trusting heart, having sweet promise of much fruit in joy, was cut down
                        and withered to the very core, consumed into moulding dust; therefore,
                        surely, the barren blighted soil where it had grown, was all the more fit to
                        gather in new seed to blossom forth with happier affections.</p>
                    <p>This was his hope; and swift as those of Millicent Grey herself, the feet of
                        Arthur Egerton were on the shores of France, but<pb n="154"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-155"/> unseen, unknown to her, gliding stealthily after
                        her, to make his abode in secret near her dwelling, and there to wait his
                        time; for deep selfishness makes a man most wise in his craftiness.</p>

                    <p>John Forde had been apprised of Millicent’s return, but doubtless all
                        recollection of it had passed again from his mind, too full of one absorbing
                        idea to have the power of retaining any other. He sat in his usual attitude
                        as she came into the room the same day that she arrived at Aix, and she
                        paused to look upon him; for it was a strange thing to her to feel how
                        thoroughly at last she understood him! Albeit life was in one sense to her
                        but a deeper and more horrible enigma, yet, the secret of <emph>his</emph>
                        existence was plain to her at least, for it had its root and spring in the
                        same dark source as her own.</p>
                    <p>She advanced and stood before him, so that he lifted up his head to look upon
                            her,<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7184-159"/> and suddenly a cry burst from his
                        lips as if he had seen a vision; his dilated eyes seemed starting from their
                        sockets. It was in sorrow that her mother had last gazed upon him; and in
                        sorrow, as her child now met his eyes, the likeness which he never before
                        had observed between them became strikingly apparent; he knew well it was
                        not <emph>her</emph>, his own beloved—he never could be deceived in this;
                        but it sent an aching pang into his heart, a shuddering thrill into his
                        frame to see a living form so like to hers.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, what and who are you that come to me,” he said; “pale and stricken even
                        as she came, mourning for her first‐born, with death at her heart, and
                        anguish in her soul?”</p>
                    <p>“I am her most unhappy child,” said Millicent; “and like her, I come
                        mourning,—mourning for my first‐born hope, which is a dead and buried
                        corpse, and I would there<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7184-160"/> were the mortal
                        death at my heart which wrought her rest so speedily, for truly there is the
                        bitter anguish in my soul!”</p>
                    <p>“Her child—yes, it is true, I now remember all, you are her child, and in
                        agony of heart! Millicent, she will not sleep calmly in her grave if this be
                        so—can I not comfort you? I shall hear her wailing through the dust for you
                        this night if sorrow is upon you; tell me what is your grief, that I may
                        soothe you and bid her rest.”</p>
                    <p>“Alas! she will never more repose if my anguish can make her restless in her
                        coffin! I have neglected your warning—I have forgotten your instructions,
                        and therefore am I here a lost and stricken being. You bid me never seek to
                        make my rest upon the hard rock of a human heart, but I have disobeyed you,
                        and have laid down myself and my whole life upon it; and I have been driven
                        forth from that inhospitable home,<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7184-161"/> all
                        bruised and wounded, to fall down hopeless at your side.”</p>
                    <p>And she fell down as she spoke, abject as the despairing ever must be, whilst
                        he bent over her in mute compassion, for there was entire sympathy between
                        them now; their souls had met on the level of their common anguish; and the
                        young girl, for whom the glory of life’s summer should but have been
                        commencing, and the old man who was fast entering into the shadow of the
                        tomb, were as one in their mutual desolation.</p>
                    <p>From that hour the life of Millicent Grey may be described in the single
                            word—<emph>vacancy</emph>. We have said that she had no hope—nor thought
                        of seeking any, beyond this life—and in this life, her lips had attested to
                        the truth—all hope was dead, so it was darkness above and around, and utter
                        apathy and lifelessness within. She had not yet learned the lessons which
                        the history of<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7184-162"/> her existence had been
                        appointed to teach her—she had believed that the spirit’s rest, the longing
                        of the whole being, was to find its full satisfaction in human love; she had
                        sought it there, and instead of rest had found a gnawing anguish; instead of
                        a satisfying joy, an intolerable desolation; yet she continued to believe
                        her early creed most true, convinced that this unhappy consummation was but
                        the evil of her special destiny, and <emph>not</emph> the result of one
                        incontestable truth—that in human love, as in all things human whatsoever,
                        no soul immortal can repose. This lesson her future career was still to
                        teach her; but meanwhile she did but believe, that she had risked a bold
                        venture in the great game of life, and had for ever lost—that she was but
                        one in a thousand. Multitudes like her might lose; some few might win: it
                        was the mere playing at hazard, in which the fate of each one, for good or
                        ill, was sealed as it<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7184-163"/> were by the fling of
                        the dice. This was her wretched philosophy, poor child, for none had ever
                        spoken truth to her, the sweet accents of mercy were unknown to her heart;
                        but soon it was decreed that the voice of her own sorrow should speak them
                        to her.</p>
                    <p>So day by day she wandered to and fro, the mute, pale semblance of a living
                        agony. Aylmer had driven her out from his arms into a bleak, cold
                        wilderness, and she was as a stray leaf blown by the blast of destiny upon
                        that desolate shore.</p>
                    <p>She saw not the figure of him who watched her hour by hour, and ever sought
                        to discover whether those despairing eyes seemed a shade less dreary, that
                        he might come to speak to her of hope renewed; but Arthur dared not still
                        approach her, for never yet had they looked up to tell his far‐off wistful
                        gaze, of aught save love unchanging, even in its great despair.</p>
                    <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7184-164"/>
                    <p>One evening, when all was very still and lovely in the serene heavens and the
                        quiet earth, Millicent Grey went forth in her miserable restlessness, to
                        wander over the plain which extends beyond the fair town of Aix; and she
                        dreamed once more, as she walked along, of that day to which ever her weary
                        heart was turning,—the day when last she wandered the joyous bride of
                        Stephen Aylmer, through the old woods of Rookcliffe,—before ever that
                        fiend‐like soul, clad in angelic beauty, crossed her prosperous path,—the
                        day when, for the first time, her eyes and his had looked on Juliet
                        Egerton.</p>
                    <p>Overstepping the intervening anguish, she loved to rest upon that hour, the
                        last of her departed brightness,—the closing scene of her dead life of joy;
                        and as she thought upon it, all that she had suffered since, her intense,
                        intolerable misery, of every moment,<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7184-165"/> day
                        and hour, seemed to gather itself up in one vast load upon her breast, so
                        that, unable to bear the overwhelming pressure, she lifted up her eyes with
                        an awful appealing look to heaven, and gave vent to a long, deep sigh.</p>
                    <p>And now, hath it ever been known that the sigh of one poor helpless mourner,
                        by the hand of a fellow creature stricken, ascending up to the retributive
                        skies, hath been answered from thence, in thunders on the head of him who
                        wrought the woe?</p>
                    <p>We know not,—we can but tell how it came to pass upon this night with
                        Millicent Grey and Stephen Aylmer. On the selfsame evening, at the self‐same
                        hour, that through the clear blue air of sweet Provence, that deep,
                        heart‐breaking sigh went up, Stephen Aylmer walked with her, for whom he had
                        committed murder on the life‐hope of a fellow mortal. In the fair<pb n="165"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-166"/> woods of Rookcliffe they stood, in the very path
                        where he had stood with Millicent, on the night which she was now
                        remembering in her agony,—and he, like her, remembered it; but only that in
                        the recollection he might triumph with an unholy joy over the violent
                        rending of the ties which then had bound him,—only that he might turn and
                        look with a mad exultation on the glorious beauty which he had purchased to
                        himself, with the despair of her who once had stood his promised wife upon
                        that path beside him. The very thought how, in that hour, whose memory was
                        upon him now, there had been an insurmountable barrier between himself and
                        the radiant bride he had so dearly won, made him linger with a most cruel
                        pleasure on the contrast of that day and this.</p>
                    <p>Beautiful as she was at all times, Juliet sought on this night to appear so
                        to him surpassingly; she so gloried in her own<pb n="166"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-167"/> loveliness that she was never weary of continual
                        efforts to attract renewed admiration; more especially was she desirous at
                        all times to win Aylmer’s look of enthusiastic love,—not because her own
                        affection yearned for such an answer, but because she delighted to satisfy
                        the artist’s refined imagination, and to feel that she had subdued, to the
                        worship of living beauty, the haughty soul, who so long had refused to
                        acknowledge that aught supremely fair existed, save in his own mental
                        visions.</p>
                    <p>She was wildly joyous this evening. He believed that she was so, because a
                        few days more were to see her for ever consigned to him, as his wife. How
                        would his heart have revolted from her, if he had known that her gaiety
                        resulted from the delight, with which she anticipated going forth into the
                        world with a free independence, under the sanction of his name, to gain the
                        admiration of all whom her unholy soul might seek to<pb n="167"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-168"/> fascinate, and allow the fair face on which no
                        eyes but a husband’s should have looked with joy, to be profaned by many an
                        approving glance from others. She was ever most charming in her graceful
                        vivacity, and with delight he watched her fitful movements now, each one
                        calculated more than another to place her in some attitude of exquisite
                        symmetry.</p>
                    <p>The evening was not calm and beautiful, as on the shores of France, but full
                        of that ominous sultriness which often oppresses the air in the first warm
                        days of early summer; black thunder‐clouds were passing across the troubled
                        sky, and it was plain that a furious storm was brooding; at length a flash
                        of vivid lightning rent asunder the thick dark curtain which obscured one
                        part of the heavens, and the tempest, like a wild steed freed from the rein,
                        came bounding forth in all its madness with thunders and with sweeping
                        blasts.</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7184-169"/>
                    <p>At the first crash of that sublimest music, Aylmer drew Juliet closer to him,
                        and proposed that they should at once return home, lest any danger chanced
                        to her; but she was one naturally fearless, to whom the excitement of peril
                        was delightful, and whose bold free spirit sympathized with those
                        convulsions of nature. She loved to set even the elements at defiance, and
                        to brave the very storms, for she had ever found her dominion over man so
                        complete and boundless, that she dared control, from the powers of creation
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>Instead of yielding to his entreaty that they should seek a refuge as
                        speedily as might be, she answered him with a bright smile of daring, and
                        springing from his grasp, darted on to a small hillock, which rose in a most
                        exposed situation in the centre of the park; her swift feet brought her in
                        an instant to the summit, where neither tree nor shrub were to be seen;<pb
                            n="169" xml:id="VAB7184-170"/> and there she stood, her graceful figure
                        coming out in strong relief, with its white robes against the dark lurid
                        sky, the fierce wind wantoning with her hair till it drove it, like a stream
                        of golden sunshine, over her face, and her deep, dark eyes, lit up now with
                        the glare from the heavens, turning back to him, with their sparkling glance
                        of playful defiance.</p>
                    <p>He stood rooted to the spot gazing on her; his heart well‐nigh bursting with
                        its fierce exultation to think that this being was his own.</p>
                    <p>Then her voice came sounding above the roar of the elements, sweet and clear
                        as a silver bell.</p>
                    <p>“Take heed, <foreign xml:lang="fre">preux chevalier</foreign>, of your fame
                        as a brave knight; why stand you there gazing, when I have passed through
                        the storm, and believed you would follow me? Do you fear this great battle
                        of heaven, where the lightnings are flashing<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7184-171"
                        /> like swords? Oh, shame on the man’s failing heart, when the woman herself
                        is undaunted!”</p>
                    <p>He answered the merry taunt with a smile as gay, and then bounded forth
                        through the tempest, to fly to her. She saw him coming in the strength of
                        his manhood, beautiful he seemed to her, and was in truth; noble the face
                        and stately the form,—proud and free was the spirit within,—he came with his
                        haughty steps firm on the ground, his doting eyes fixed on his earthly love.
                        And then it was that in the still plains of the far Provence, the deep sigh
                        went up,—the breath, as it were, of the breaking heart, and straightway, in
                        the selfsame moment, from the angry heavens a thunderbolt came crashing
                        down. It gleamed through the clouds, but it tarried not there; it lit up the
                        mountains, but it had no mission to them; on through the boundless air
                        direct to one spot, the fierce<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7184-172"/> dart of
                        that lightning came—bright arrow of heaven—on the head of the guilty Aylmer
                        it struck, with an aim unerring, and down, down to the dust, in the pride of
                        his days, the strong man fell like a fainting child.</p>
                    <p>No sight more awful ever passed in the face of day, for the form that stood
                        upright in its beauty and power, in one second of time had gone down to the
                        earth as a shattered mass, burnt and blackened, a quivering heap! She saw it
                        lie there a human frame, as it seemed, no longer, but a shapeless, distorted
                        thing, horrible to see, fearful to think on; and wild through the air her
                        piercing voice rang out, shriek upon shriek, in her agony of horror! One
                        moment’s bewilderment, one moment doubt whether, it were possible that the
                        proud, stately man, in this brief passing instant, had, indeed, been
                        transformed into that black mass of cinders and ashes, where the stir of the
                        life that yet lingered among<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7184-173"/> them but
                        rendered the sight more terrible. And then the conviction that it was so
                        indeed, that he was stricken down by the wrath of heaven, came deep and
                        strong into her soul. It came and with it, to her clear, subtle mind, an
                        image of all the results that must follow this awful event, and with
                        well‐nigh a curse on her woman’s lips, for the sudden failing of her schemes
                        of pleasure, she fled wailing and shrieking through the woods of the park.
                        She fled, but not to him, for she loved him not, pure love would have
                        overcome the revolting of humanity, from the sight of the blackened,
                        palpitating mass; but Juliet even in that hour, had a care for herself.</p>
                    <p>She had a horror of death, a horror of suffering, a horror of all which could
                        render life, to her eyes, other than a bright vision of triumph. To
                            <emph>enjoy</emph> all the world can give, with an intensity of
                        selfishness, was her aim and her principle, her hope and her faith;<pb
                            n="173" xml:id="VAB7184-174"/> whatever aided this plan of existence was
                        sought for and cherished,—whatever marred or destroyed it was hated and
                        abandoned;—whilst Aylmer could assist her in attaining her object, she
                        trampled all under foot to bind him to her. But now, when by this awful
                        judgment, he could do so no longer, even though life yet lingered in the
                        scorched and distorted frame; already was she his no more. She must act her
                        part for the time, however, and truly she had no need to feign her
                        consternation, for she did feel an intensity of dismay as well as sore grief
                        and anger for the destruction of her own bright hopes,—so shrieking and in
                        tears she fled on to her home, and sent them forth to bring back the
                        shattered corpse (it might be) of her lover. But they found him still
                        living, and it was the lingering of life in that calcined heap which most
                        struck on their hearts with horror; not a feature was discernible, seared,
                        blackened, and scorched,<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7184-175"/> not a limb but
                        was full of distortion, and evidently paralyzed by the dreadful shock.</p>
                    <p>They carried him home in mute terror and grief; physicians were procured, but
                        they said if he did not die at once, it would be many days before they could
                        give an opinion; the great dread seemed to be of his living, so frightful,
                        if he did, must be the life in that stricken frame. Then followed an
                        interval of dreariness and mourning—the house silent and darkened—the voices
                        hushed—the steps of attendants only stealing to and fro. Mrs. Hartley came
                        from Milton Lodge, and night and day waited unremittingly on her unhappy
                        nephew. Mrs. Egerton, too, was ever at his side; but Juliet declared that
                        her delicate frame could not endure such fatigue and anxiety; she retired to
                        her own suite of rooms, and there surrounded herself with everything bright
                        and pleasant, that could shut out all thought of the horrid scenes else‐<pb
                            n="175" xml:id="VAB7184-176"/> where enacted in the house. She was but
                        waiting for the medical decision, to know whether this stricken man could
                        ever more be made available for the purposes of her life.</p>
                    <p>After a time, the fiat of the physicians was definitely given; Stephen Aylmer
                        would live—but he would live, blind and a paralyzed cripple: stone blind he
                        was, and irrevocably so; he that with such idolatry had worshipped the
                        Beautiful, upon the beautiful never more should be allowed to gaze; not only
                        the sight was gone, but the very eyes were burnt up in their sockets; nor
                        was this all, a complete paralysis had possession of his frame. It might
                        with the lapse of time diminish, the physicians said, but the limbs would
                        never regain their form, nor the features lose that fatal distortion. So
                        convulsed the frame—so seared the once fair countenance, that Stephen
                        Aylmer, proud and noble as he had been, was now an object moat unsightly,
                        from which com‐<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7184-177"/> passion only, could
                        prevent his fellow creatures turning even with loathing! His faculties were
                        unimpaired, excepting the hopeless fearful blindness, of which he had a full
                        consciousness, from the moment that his senses returned.</p>
                    <p>When Juliet heard the final report of the case, and learnt distinctly that
                        there could be no further change, she expressed a wish to see him, but that
                        he should not himself be made aware of her presence; she was one who chose
                        always to be convinced on any matter of moment by personal observation, and
                        she desired to confirm with her own eyes the information she had received
                        respecting it. If indeed, it were correct, she must straightway depart to
                        seek for other instruments to effect her enjoyment in this life; and into
                        the presence of him, now powerless to serve her, she never more would
                        come.</p>
                    <p>So she went into the darkened room where he lay, and with no gentle hand<pb
                            n="177" xml:id="VAB7184-178"/> drew back the curtain from the window,
                        that she might the better scan his countenance. We have described the
                        revolting spectacle that wretched man presented, for truly he was but a
                        living soul, linked to a mass of powerless clay; she looked on him, and over
                        that beautiful face there passed an expression of contemptuous disgust! Who
                        shall measure the degradation to her whole being, of which that look gave
                        evidence! Then she let the curtain fall, restoring him truly to a two‐fold
                        gloom, and passed from his presence for ever. They never met again on this
                        side of the grave.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>JULIET EGERTON</hi> left Rookcliffe the day after her silent interview
                        with the man, who, for her sake had bartered honour and truth, and
                        righteousness; she said, that after the shock her nerves had received, her
                        health required an entire change. She returned to Italy with her friend Mrs.
                        Wilmot, and not many months after she was the wife of an Italian
                        nobleman.</p>
                    <p>The first word that Stephen Aylmer uttered when his speech returned to him
                        was “Juliet;” he had been quite conscious<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7184-180"/>
                        long before the paralysis was so far overcome as to allow him to articulate,
                        but even then he could utter only the unformed hesitating sounds, which form
                        so painful a peculiarity in the palsied; and this defect, the physicians
                        said, could never more be remedied. He who had so largely possessed the gift
                        of free and noble eloquence, whose voice had been as most melodious music,
                        must never speak but in those gabbling hateful accents, and of them, at
                        present, he could make use but sparingly.</p>
                    <p>Still, his first word of difficult utterance was “Juliet,”—it was to Mrs.
                        Hartley he spoke, who sat beside him; he had formerly manifested by signs,
                        that he was fully aware both of his irrevocable blindness and of his
                        melancholy paralysis; therefore, she knew he would understand her, and she
                        thought it best he should know the truth of Juliet’s desertion at once. The
                        tone of agonizing anxiety in which he uttered that name,<pb n="180"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-181"/> showed that he well knew what he had to fear; her
                        answer was to bend down over him and whisper, “Heaven have mercy upon you,
                        and give you strength to endure the life which has been restored to
                        you.”</p>
                    <p>The look of agony which settled down upon the countenance, already made
                        hideous by its distortion, as she spoke these words, was too dreadful for
                        her to look upon; she saw that he had understood his cruel abandonment,—he
                        lifted up the one scorched arm of which alone he retained the use, and hid
                        his face upon it, whilst he said in a tone that told how fearful an import
                        he gave to the words:—</p>
                    <p>“It is darkness—darkness without and within!”</p>
                    <p>From that hour he sank into a complete and most mournful lethargy; nothing
                        could induce him to utter a word, and he never spoke again for many
                        months—he became as a mass of lifeless clay in their hands.</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7184-182"/>
                    <p>They might move him from place to place—they might try remedies of all sorts
                        they might leave him alone or surround him with the gaiety wherewith they
                        thought to enliven him, he seemed alike indifferent and unconscious of all;
                        he had not yet recovered the power of walking, though it was hoped he might
                        ultimately regain the use of his limbs, and day after day he lay like an
                        inanimate heap, refusing to respond so much as by a pressure of the hand to
                        the solicitude of those around him. It was as though the soul like the body
                        were palsied for ever; no one could look on him without grieving that he had
                        not expired altogether under the blow which had deprived him of light, and
                        hope, and joy, and all but the mere mechanical process of life.</p>
                    <p>It seemed plain that this regret was so strong in his own breast, that he
                        sought to be in actual truth as one dead already; no word ever passed the
                        parched lips—no<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7184-183"/> voluntary movement ever
                        indicated that there was life in the frame; and, yet it was an awful thing
                        to think on all that was really passing behind the impenetrable barrier,
                        which his sightless eyes and his resolute dumbness had raised between
                        himself and the rest of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Fearful, indeed, to feel that the soul <emph>was</emph> alive, a prisoner—in
                        darkness, silence, and solitude, within that dungeon of powerless flesh, and
                        not alive alone, but with powers unimpaired, only that they could no more be
                        exercised,—with talents undiminished, only that they must lie rotting in
                        inaction,—with wishes unquenched,—only that for ever vain they must eat into
                        his heart like fire, and with the strong fierce ungovernable love which had
                        made him in his pride of strength and beauty, perjured and well nigh a
                        murderer, still as deep and as wildly resistless,—only that the hope so near
                        a reality, of its entire blessedness in her con‐<pb n="183"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-184"/> tinual presence had been torn away from him, like
                        the rending of the very life from his body. There remained nothing now but
                        the maddening certainty that he might with unabated affection yearn and pine
                        for her, as a mother over a slaughtered child; but that more readily the
                        dead would rise at the call of love in agony, than Juliet Egerton return now
                        to him, to be the maimed and wretched cripple’s wife.</p>
                    <p>Oh, the howling tempest, incessant, day and night, that raged beneath that
                        lifeless calm exterior!—the world and the things of it had been all in all
                        to him, and from that world he was now debarred as utterly as any captive,
                        chained in some prison, fathoms deep within the earth; but its influence was
                        strong as ever, and whilst he lay powerless and like some senseless clod—the
                        ardent, earthly love—the burning ambition—ambition alike of joy and fame,
                        were trampling down his very soul with their mad impatient<pb n="184"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-185"/> struggling for release. He knew well, however,
                        the utter hopelessness of his condition, and it was despair which bound him
                        in that frightful changeless lethargy.</p>
                    <p>Thus the days passed on for Stephen Aylmer, once as proud and noble a
                        representation of humanity as ever mortal eyes beheld; the gifted
                        genius,—the man of winning eloquence and lofty intellect, subduing many
                        minds to his,—now cast there at the feet of any who came to look on him with
                        pity,—a spectacle revolting from infirmity, piteous to behold, in his blind
                        solitude and dumb despair.</p>
                    <p>It became necessary to remove him from Rookcliffe, whose threshold truly, his
                        feet had passed only to bring dark evils in their train. Mrs. Hartley
                        determined, for the present, to devote herself to him, though it was sad for
                        her to leave the poor old Colonel, now half broken‐hearted with his nephew’s
                        calamity.</p>
                    <pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7184-186"/>
                    <p>The physicians recommended that Aylmer should be conveyed to certain baths,
                        in a mountainous region of Switzerland, and thither Mrs. Hartley proceeded
                        with him, as soon as he was able to move.</p>
                    <p>It was thought that the efficacy of these mineral waters, would gradually
                        restore to him the use of his limbs, as well as his power of articulation;
                        and this expectation was ultimately realized; but it was many months before
                        any such result took place, and in the interval he was unable to bear an
                        exertion greater than that of being wheeled in his chair from room to room.
                        It was during this period, however, that the events occurred which must now
                        be recorded.</p>
                    <p>The dwelling in which Mrs. Hartley fixed their abode was a solitary <foreign
                            xml:lang="fre">châlet</foreign>, half hidden among the rocks and pine
                        trees of lofty Swiss mountains; the baths were close at hand, but at that
                        season, fortunately for<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7184-187"/> Aylmer, the place
                        was entirely deserted, and the solitude as complete as even his despairing
                        heart could have desired. It was not until things were completely
                        established in this new home that Mrs. Hartley determined on making
                        Millicent Grey acquainted with all that had taken place. No one had written
                        to her from Rookcliffe, feeling, perhaps, that it was at once too painful
                        and too difficult a subject, and her kind old friend knew well, therefore,
                        that she was at present under the firm persuasion that Juliet Egerton was
                        the most happy wife of him she had loved as a woman loves but once.</p>
                    <p>It was impossible to divine all that might occur when Millicent should be
                        made aware of the truth, but Mrs. Hartley was resolved that she should be
                        acquainted with the simple facts without word or comment from any one, and
                        that the result must be left as a problem which no human hand could
                        solve.</p>
                    <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7184-188"/>
                    <p>She had deeply felt, throughout the whole of the strange drama, which had
                        been played in the lives of Millicent and Aylmer, that powers, not of earth,
                        were, dealing with them; she knew, by the instinct of those who have been
                        enabled, because of their very simplicity, to draw deeply from the wells of
                        spiritual knowledge, that this was a case with which no mortal dared tamper:
                        clearly there was a struggle going on for the souls of these two living
                        creatures, and the judgment which had fallen on Stephen, with the whole
                        series of events now passing was but the outward machinery, of the hidden
                        power that was working within them.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley would not venture to interfere by word or act in the development
                        of their destiny; she conceived it to be her part merely to sit by a silent
                        spectator,—ready, if ever human agents seemed necessary, to step in and
                        befriend them both. This much of active duty only she believed<pb n="188"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-189"/> was hers in the matter, to take care that
                        Millicent should be apprised of all the truth, and then she would leave her
                        to act as she might be led by mysterious influences, too subtle for her
                        human eyes to discern.</p>
                    <p>And Mrs. Hartley wrote,—she gave a simple detail of the awful calamity which
                        had befallen Stephen Aylmer, and of his present condition. She quietly
                        stated the fact of Juliet’s marriage, which had just taken place, without
                        even the delay that a mere consideration for the forms of the world would
                        have demanded, of her, so recently engaged to the unhappy man whose sore
                        punishment she had left him to bear alone. Further, Mrs. Hartley gave a
                        brief account of their present mode of life in Switzerland; she and her
                        nephew were, she said, entirely alone,—not only cut off, as they wished to
                        be, from all society, but with only one or two servants, as Aylmer could not
                        endure the tumult of many per‐<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7184-190"/> sons near
                        him. She concluded by saying, that on this account he required from her more
                        attendance than she was able, at her advanced age, to give him; that it
                        would have been well if she could have read to him for several hours each
                        day, in order to withdraw his mind from the distracting thoughts which,
                        notwithstanding his unbroken silence, she knew must be preying on him;
                        especially as at night he was often seized with paroxysms of pain, which
                        rendered it necessary that he should be carried into a freer current of air,
                        and watched over for hours together.</p>
                    <p>This letter arrived at Aix one day when Millicent Grey was walking in the
                        garden with Arthur Egerton. It was now some time since he had made her aware
                        of his presence in the town, and had been admitted to her society; he had
                        not decided on taking this step, however, because he had perceived in her
                        any indication of that<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7184-191"/> forgetfulness of
                        the past, which could alone give him hope.</p>
                    <p>So far from that, it was rather because he had found it too great torture, to
                        watch unseen the hourly manifestation of the deep, loving faithfulness, even
                        in anguish, of that breaking heart,—and the longing to hear her voice again,
                        to meet her sweet, sorrowful smile, drove him, almost as hopeless as
                        herself, into her presence at last. It was at first a great shock to her to
                        see him,—she thought it would be utterly insupportable to her, to look again
                        one of those who had been around her the time of her dream‐like joys—when
                        she could lift up her loving eyes, upon the dear face, for which she now
                        pined, as one in utter darkness pants for a ray of light; but after a time
                        she found that when the mind is intensely absorbed by one great agony of
                        thought, no outward circumstances can much affect it. She saw that it was<pb
                            n="191" xml:id="VAB7184-192"/> as life to Arthur Egerton to be with her,
                        and her sweet, gentle nature was not changed; she was willing and glad to
                        give him, what she felt was but the poor joy of living in her presence, for
                        she never imagined one single instant, that he could suppose it possible for
                        her so much as to tolerate the expression of any other love than that of
                        Stephen Aylmer’s.</p>
                    <p>Millicent Grey was one of those, whose refinement of spirit and instinctive
                        purity of feeling causes them to hold, almost as a holy doctrine, the
                        sacredness of the one affection sufficing for a lifetime,—it was to her a
                        very sacrilege, to think of giving to another, that throne within her soul
                        where she had placed one only human being; what though he had abandoned that
                        high dwelling, and left her breast a desert waste, yet had she consecrated
                        her life and herself to him (woe to her that she dared so to do by any human
                        being!)—and now it was re‐<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7184-193"/> volting to her,
                        even to suppose that any would dare to profane that offering, by so much as
                        a word of affection.</p>
                    <p>Long before she had learned these things by her own experience, it had been
                        to her one of the bewildering anomalies of this world, that any should have
                        the power or the will, to admit two affections into their life; she would as
                        soon have thought of holding two opposing creeds at once.</p>
                    <p>Millicent never dreaded, then, any expression of attachment from Arthur, for
                        she imagined he must plainly understand this feeling, and share in it
                        himself, and she therefore admitted him to her presence, the more
                        compassionately that herself would have been so well content but to have
                        received a like permission to hear the voice and see the face of him she
                        loved, as hopelessly as she believed herself to be beloved.</p>
                    <p>She was so far right in her conclusion, that Arthur did read and understand
                            the<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7184-194"/> depths of that heart thus
                        consecrated to one feeling only, but still in his own madness of hope, he
                        would not despair,—he had so worked himself into a frantic intensity of love
                        for her, that he felt, what was in truth the case, an utter impossibility
                        within his soul to endure the absence of all hope; such a consummation would
                        produce, he felt certain, a very convulsion in his nature; and he clung to
                        the faintest shadow of a chance with the tenacity of one who feels he is
                        grasping, as it were, at the last shreds of life.</p>
                    <p>He persuaded himself, also, that he was not so utterly mad, in refraining as
                        yet from despair, because Millicent gradually manifested some pleasure in
                        his society. She did not hide from him, but that was merely because she
                        found a melancholy enjoyment in talking with him of the days of her departed
                        happiness; it seemed to prove to her that all was not a dream,—to<pb n="194"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-195"/> convince her of what, in her extremity of
                        wretchedness, she almost doubted, even that joy <emph>did</emph> exist in
                        the world, and had existed for herself; but still, though he knew this was
                        the feeling, which made a faint light steal into those sweet dim eyes when
                        he came near, it was not only unutterable enjoyment to him to meet their
                        glance, but a something less than hopelessness to win it.</p>
                    <p>So they walked in the garden together, and Arthur was thinking, during one of
                        the long fits of abstraction into which Millicent fell perpetually, that,
                        notwithstanding the exquisite torture it was to him, to see the faithfulness
                        of her soul to Stephen Aylmer, this was still, well‐nigh, the brightest,
                        period of his existence,—for she was his alone, at least, to look upon;
                            <emph>he</emph> only heard her voice, <emph>he</emph> only gazed upon
                        her face, none shared with him the air she breathed,—he could close the eyes
                        of his memory, as it were, and believe for a moment that her<pb n="195"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-196"/> inward love was his alone, as fully as her
                        outward presence. And then it was to him, ineffable delight, to gloat over
                        the fact in which he implicitly believed—that Stephen Aylmer was long since
                        the husband of his sister Juliet; he had no reason to suppose the contrary,
                        as he had carefully concealed from his family where he had made his abode,
                        and, consequently, had received no tidings from them.</p>
                    <p>It was Nanette who brought Mrs. Hartley’s letter, she came running as fast as
                        her little feet could carry her; for she knew that if anything could have
                        rendered the spirit of poor Millicent more desolate and heavy than it had
                        been these many months, it was the singular silence which all her English
                        friends had so long preserved;—she little dreamed their motive!</p>
                    <p>She believed that they had abstained from writing out of tenderness to
                        herself, because they must have communicated the<pb n="196"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-197"/> fact of Stephen’s marriage. Mrs. Hartley,
                        especially, who, at first, had been her regular correspondent, she could
                        well imagine had lost the courage, to write her the details of that which
                        was her life’s calamity; yet she felt that if this was their motive, it was
                        a most mistaken kindness. What was the one object she had set before herself
                        when she entered on the stern and terrible path of complete self‐sacrifice?
                        Was it not his happiness, and his alone—was not this the reward to which she
                        looked when with her own hand she plunged, as it were, a knife into her
                        breast, and had she not then a right to know that her work was accomplished,
                        and her mournful recompense granted unto her?</p>
                    <p>Poor little Nanette, who had been utterly bewildered by all that occurred in
                        England, the whole proceedings being most incomprehensible to her, had,
                        after a vain attempt to discover who it was she ought to hate for Mil‐<pb
                            n="197" xml:id="VAB7184-198"/> licent’s sake, decided on remaining
                        enraged with the whole world, except Père André,—because some one, she did
                        not know who, had somehow, she could not tell why, made her darling
                        miserable! but most of all she was furious at finding Millicent again
                        consigned to the barren solitude of her life at Aix. To poor John Forde,
                        Nanette had a mortal antipathy, resulting from what she conceived to be his
                        most unjustifiable obstinacy, in maintaining a gloomy silence. Talking was
                        to this good little woman, the great business and pleasure of life, and she
                        looked upon it as a positive crime in her master to throw away his gift in
                        this respect,—she declared he was worse than any owl she ever had heard
                        of,—for they <emph>did</emph> hoot at night, which Monsieur Forde never
                        condescended to do; and her great object was to induce Millicent to leave
                        him, lest she should acquire the same fatal propensity.</p>
                    <p>The arrival on this day, therefore, of a<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7184-199"/>
                        letter for Miss Grey, was a source of immense delight to her, as she trusted
                        it might contain her recall to England. So tumbling along like a little,
                        fat, round tortoise in a hurry, Nanette made all speed through the mulberry
                        walks to her mistress.</p>
                    <p>“Une lettre, une lettre,” she shouted, pitching her shrill voice at some
                        extraordinary height; “it comes, I dare say, from that detestable Angleterre
                        (Je n’ose pas dire ce maudit pays, le Père André ne permet pus de jurements;
                        mais c’est égal, je sais ce que je pense). Une lettre, ma chérie, ça te fera
                        sourire peut‐être.”</p>
                    <p>It was not a smile, however, but an ashy paleness, which spread over the face
                        of Millicent Grey as she took the letter in her hand.</p>
                    <p>She never doubted but that it contained the news of the final union of Aylmer
                        and Juliet; and though she did in all sincerity desire the assurance of that
                        happiness for<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7184-200"/> which she had laboured with
                        such bitter toil, yet the thought of seeing the irrevocable words made her
                        spirit quail within her.</p>
                    <p>She tore it open and began to read; Arthur watched her with a most inhuman
                        exultation, for he interpreted the arrival of the letter as she did; and it
                        is extraordinary, when a powerful principle, like that of his love for
                        Millicent, is working in the mind of a man, unguarded by the yet loftier and
                        supreme aim of inward rectitude, how it turns all other feelings within the
                        soul to very poison.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, however, his cruel pleasure passed away, and he stood aghast as he
                        saw the wild, changing expressions which were passing over the face of
                        Millicent Grey, like clouds driven by an inward tempest; he saw at once that
                        some extraordinary tidings must have done this. The mere confirmation of the
                        misery, which she<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7184-201"/> had so resolutely
                        accepted as her portion, by the announcement of Aylmer’s marriage, could
                        never have aroused all the passionate feelings which he saw were agitating
                        her now; that would have produced only the settled fearful calm of utter
                        hopelessness, but nosy there was plainly on that expressive
                        countenance—horror, and sorrow, and anxiety. What could it all mean?
                        Suddenly Millicent let the letter fall, and clasped her shaking hands, with
                        a wild mournful cry.</p>
                    <p>Honour be to the true woman’s heart within her; she did not for one moment
                        exult that Juliet never was—never would be his wife, nor triumph in her base
                        and heartless desertion, so different to the deep love, faithful in
                        uttermost despair, which came gushing round her heart at that moment. No,
                        she had but one thought in this hour, it was for his suffering; but one
                        desire,—to weep and to struggle, and to<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7184-202"/>
                        spend her life in heart‐breaking supplication, that he might be restored to
                        light, to joy, to comfort by any means, in any way; and never—never would
                        she ask that in this renewed life, he should bless her with so much as a
                        thought!</p>
                    <p>“Millicent, what has happened? In the name of mercy, speak! say what has
                        happened? Why do you look so wildly to heaven—what can have occurred? They
                        are married, are they not? Aylmer is married! only say that nothing has
                        prevented his marriage with my sister!”</p>
                    <p>The cold drops literally stood like dew on his forehead as the terror took
                        possession of him, that some event might have occurred to prevent that
                        union.</p>
                    <p>Millicent pointed to the letter, intimating that he might read it himself;
                        then speaking rather to her own fainting soul than to him, she
                        exclaimed—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, why am I here? What have I to do<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7184-203"/> in
                        this place? <emph>he</emph> is suffering in pain, in darkness, in solitude;
                        and why am I lingering here?”</p>
                    <p>She smote on her breast, as though like a guilty one, she would have breathed
                        out her own confession of sin; and then bounding from the spot with the
                        energy as of a new life awakening in her, she disappeared from his
                        sight.</p>
                    <p>And he too read the letter;he read that record of the working of mysterious
                        powers in this matter, where he had deeply sworn he would accomplish his own
                        will. He had been willing, if need be, to accomplish it by the sacrifice of
                        all that is noble or holy in the soul of man, and by that unrighteous
                        offering, it had seemed to him that already he had effected much, and was
                        likely to effect much more. He, it was, in actual fact, who had torn
                        Millicent from Aylmer’s love; his were the hands that dug out the great gulf
                        which had divided them,<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7184-204"/> and now when that
                        consummation was on the very point of taking place, which was, as he
                        believed, to have flung her, wounded in spirit, broken in heart, into his
                        grasping arms,—the very thunders had bestirred themselves to send the
                        lightning‐flash, which had again removed the barrier from between Millicent
                        Grey and Stephen Aylmer! It were not easy to describe the impotent rage of
                        this unhappy man, when he found that these things were so. True, Stephen was
                        a helpless cripple, and in this he boldly rejoiced; for as we have said, his
                        whole mind was perverted by the influence of the fierce passion which ruled
                        him; but he felt not the less, that since no union with another could
                        separate them now, this very infirmity and suffering would but make
                        Millicent cling the more closely to him, and live the more devotedly for
                        him, in heart and soul, even though she never took the name of his wife.</p>
                    <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7184-205"/>
                    <p>Arthur felt that he should lose that sweet presence now, in which he had
                        lived, as we live in the warmth and light of the sun in heaven. He saw not
                        only that she would go to Aylmer, flying back to him like the stricken bird
                        to its beloved nest, but that even if he followed her there, it would be to
                        see her so wrapt and absorbed, in but the mere fact that Stephen Aylmer was
                        present with her, (though even still in heart estranged,) that never more
                        would fall on him so much as one of those pitying glances for which his
                        longing spirit pined.</p>
                    <p>And this just when faint gleams of hope were stealing, however falsely, into
                        his dark life. Oh, that he could have annihilated the truth contained in
                        that letter which he tramples under his feet now in frantic rage! But soon
                        this first burst of passion subsided, and a feeling rose within him, which
                        produced a complete though a fearful calm.</p>
                    <pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7184-206"/>
                    <p>It was the conviction, joined to the indomitable resolution, that he must and
                        would obtain this, the object and desire of <emph>his</emph> soul, or perish
                        most utterly in the struggle; he had ever felt that his whole heart—his
                        whole being demanded the presence at least, if not the love of Millicent
                        Grey, as a stern necessity—a principle of life for life required; and he
                        knew, as if it had been revealed to him of another man than himself, that
                        whilst the human breath yet lingered on his lips, and the vital flame burnt
                        in his breast, he would so toil and battle for the attainment of this, the
                        great good of his existence; that at least, his worst of failure, should be,
                        her expiring with him in the mortal strife.</p>

                    <p><hi>SWEET</hi> and fresh as an angel’s breath came the mountain air through
                        that open window, and the music of nature’s deep voice was with it; a voice
                        most glorious, the mingling of many tones ever chanting the same burden, the
                        great mystery of love. What aching heart ever heard it and refused comfort?
                        None who understand the language it speaks; but there are some who do not,
                        and Stephen Aylmer was one! The melody with which it sung to‐day, was the<pb
                            n="207" xml:id="VAB7184-208"/> rushing sound of the wind in the
                        pine‐grove, and the far off echo of falling waters. So soft, so soothing,
                        one would have thought it must have stolen into his charmed soul and wakened
                        him from that frightful lethargy; but the soul <emph>was</emph> awake for
                        its own greater agony, the lethargy was but of body, assumed, that none
                        might torture him by probing his cankering wound, or remind him that he yet
                        belonged, blind and degraded, helpless and despairing, to that race among
                        whom he had walked as of a nature superior to all;—so strong in his talent
                        and beauty, having but to stretch forth his hand, to take at his will, of
                        earthly joys offered to him by the noblest and fairest.</p>
                    <p>He lay in the position which he seldom changed, on a sofa drawn close to the
                        window; the face scarred and seared by the scorching of heaven’s own fire,
                        to that heaven was upturned in sullen despair; the<pb n="208"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-209"/> darkened eyes closed—the lips indomitably sealed;
                        the hands into which the power of movement was beginning to return, laid
                        motionless on his breast.</p>
                    <p>It was thus that he remained day after day, taking no heed of any,
                        manifesting neither pleasure nor pain at all that was done for him, yet
                        making it sufficiently plain that he was not only always perfectly
                        conscious, but that his unimpaired senses had acquired that acuteness which
                        blindness most often produces. It would be impossible to conceive a figure
                        more perfectly expressive of a rigid, mute, and dogged suffering:—in every
                        line of that countenance, and even of that listless frame these words seemed

                    <p>Mrs. Hartley sat by his side; and often the work which occupied her fell from
                        her hands whilst she lifted up her eyes to look<pb n="209"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-210"/> on that melancholy picture, and wonder if ever
                        those pale stern lips, closed over such tortures, would open to reveal them
                        again; and then in her beautiful patience of faith she would resume her
                        employment, feeling sure that the strange dark history was not yet over, the
                        probation not fulfilled, the trial not complete; and the working of mighty
                        influences with Millicent and Stephen Aylmer, still progressing with a
                        secret energy and power, that soon would reveal itself in great events.</p>
                    <p>Whilst Mrs. Hartley thus pondered, she heard a movement in the room without,
                        which was divided from that in which she sat, by a door, now standing wide
                        open: what she heard was the echo of a faint footfall, with a sort of
                        fluttering sound, and the whisper of a soft, sobbing breath.</p>
                    <p>The impression it gave her was as though some poor dove, with throbbing
                        breast and failing wing, had come wandering in, and<pb n="210"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-211"/> was expiring there,—but her own heart’s sympathy
                        told her what it really was. She rose and passed into the other room, where
                        she found, as she expected, poor Millicent Grey leaning against the wall
                        with a face white as marble, and hands icy cold, faint, and opprest, almost
                        dying under the overwhelming conviction that she was breathing the same air
                        as Stephen Aylmer.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley took her in her arms, and let her lie there silent, feeling with
                        intense pity the quick, fearful throbbing of that poor heart against her
                        own. She said merely what she knew would give her a soothing assurance.</p>
                    <p>“I expected you; I hoped you would come.” And then kissed the quivering lips
                        that had not power to answer. Millicent lay very still in that kind embrace
                        for a few minutes; but when she raised herself Mrs. Hartley saw that her
                        dilated eyes<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7184-212"/> were fixed with the most
                        painful anxiety on the door of communication; she released her instantly,
                        and went to close it, lest any sound should reach Stephen Aylmer; and
                        returning to her, said softly,—</p>
                    <p>“You are right, he is there:” her words sent the blood back to that heaving
                        breast. Millicent tottered for a moment on her failing feet, but they
                        carried her at once to the spot, and kneeling down, she rested her head
                        against the wood which separated her from him who had trampled with cruel
                        feet upon her heart, and to whom that heart was rising up again in this his
                        hour of desertion and solitude, faithful and tender as the day he had first
                        asked it from her,</p>
                    <p>It seemed to give her great rest and peace to remain there, in that attitude,
                        and Mrs. Hartley did not disturb her. She saw that she was becoming quite
                        composed, and she waited quietly till she rose and came towards her; then
                        she drew her to her side,<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7184-213"/> and Millicent
                        began in a low, beseeching tone:</p>
                    <p>“You said you expected me; then you will let me stay—you will let me be with
                        him to watch over him, as no mother ever watched over a darling child, to
                        toil and slave and work for him. His poor darkened eyes will never know who
                        waits on him, and you could not condemn him to a hired service in his
                        sufferings—when such an ocean of deep free love is here! you could not
                        condemn me to such a death in life, as to know him full of pain, and
                        wretched, and I not here to soothe and to tend him! Oh, you will let me
                        stay; surely he is my own, mine, by a love that has no name in human words;
                        mine by the sacredness with which his image has lain in my soul, through all
                        my night of gloom, unprofaned by a thought but of the most devoted
                        tenderness. <emph>She</emph> has deserted him; let him not think there is no
                        truth, no purity of faithfulness remain‐<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7184-214"/>
                        ing in the world,—surely, he is my own, my treasure;—<emph>she</emph>
                        thought that treasure worthless, because of his darkened eyes, and his
                        crippled form; but to me his infirmity, his helplessness, his misery, does
                        make him only more dear, more deeply, more intensely dear. Say that I shall
                        stay with him, to be as his hired servant,—it is ennobling to wait on those
                        who are sacred by suffering. Oh, say the word, for in truth, I cannot leave
                        him; my life would pass from me in the effort.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley had let her go on making all this humble, imploring petition,
                        because, in fact, she was almost suffocated by the emotion which that
                        mournful pleading voice, and those words wrought in her; but now she exerted
                        herself to speak.</p>
                    <p>“You shall stay with him, darling; it is, in truth, your place, allotted to
                        you by no hand of man. He shall be your care, and you his gentle protector,
                        for he is helpless<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7184-215"/> as an infant. The
                        strong has become weak, and the weak how marvelously strong! Strange things
                        have come to pass, truly, and stranger yet await us, if I mistake not. But I
                        tamper not with it, go where you are led,—do as the hidden guiding bids you.
                        Only, sweet Millicent,” she hesitated, dreading the effect of her words, “he
                        must never know that it is you who are his kind attendant.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley felt convinced, knowing how Juliet yet occupied his whole soul,
                        that Millicent’s presence would be insupportable to him were he aware of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Millicent’s face blanched at the words: she most fully understood them, but
                        she answered calmly, for she had that strength within her now which most
                        women acquire, in time of trial for the weal of others, even when they are
                        weakest for their own.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I am fully aware he must not ever know it. It would deeply pain him,
                            I<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7184-216"/> know well, and would, in truth, be
                        very sad for him, to feel that one so hated was near him. But I will be very
                        careful, and I do not think that he will recognize my voice. I am so changed
                        in that and in everything.<corr>”</corr></p>
                    <p>“You are, indeed, my own poor child. I do not think that there is any fear,”
                        said Mrs. Hartley, sadly; for truly it was a heart‐breaking thing now to
                        hear poor Millicent’s voice,—the dear, birdlike tones had died into so sad,
                        uncertain a murmur, always weak and trembling, as though with the load of
                        suppressed emotion.</p>
                    <p>Even as Juliet Egerton had chosen to look on the stricken man alone, when he
                        was not aware of her presence, so did Millicent Grey now desire to see him.
                        The one had so willed it, that in her cold, calculating selfishness, which
                        seemed to belie the very woman’s nature belonging to her, she might
                        ascertain the incapacity of Aylmer to serve her any further, and then<pb
                            n="216" xml:id="VAB7184-217"/> desert him for ever; the other cherished
                        this wish solely that no one, not even himself, might be aware of the lowly
                        loving homage she pined to render unto one, now sacred in her eyes by
                        suffering.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley said she might go at once quietly in to see him, as the blind
                        man, even if he heard a movement near him, would take no notice of it, and
                        afterwards she herself would tell him that she had provided a new attendant
                        for him, when Millicent might enter without delay on her chosen and noble
                        duty.</p>
                    <p>So soon as the desired permission was thus given, Millicent rose. She was
                        resolutely calm, and Mrs. Hartley saw <emph>her</emph>, whom he had betrayed
                        and deserted,—whose spirit he had wounded,—whose life he had
                        destroyed,—glide into the presence of Stephen Aylmer; she saw her sink
                        lowly, on bended knee, before him, and press her lips with a beautiful
                            respect,—a<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7184-218"/> deep, pitying love,—to the
                        feet of the wretched, unsightly cripple, and then she closed the door, for
                        she felt it was a scene far too sacred to be profaned by human eyes.</p>
                    <p>As usual Stephen Aylmer made no answer when Mrs. Hartley told him he was to
                        be waited on by another attendant,—it was to him, like everything else, a
                        matter of perfect indifference; and Millicent at once quietly entered on the
                        post, full of labour and suffering, which she would not have exchanged for a
                        royal throne. She was careful at first not to let him hear the sound of her
                        voice, but it was soon evident, as the days passed on, that he was beginning
                        to observe, and to be pleased with, the unspeakable tenderness of the care
                        she bestowed on him,—it was impossible indeed but that the atmosphere of
                        love with which she surrounded him, should fail to penetrate even unto his
                        soul.</p>
                    <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7184-219"/>
                    <p>Gradually he began to show by his movements, and the faint smile which passed
                        over his face when her light step sounded near, how soothing and sweet to
                        him her presence was; it was plain he loved to feel her soft, cool hand
                        resting, as often it did, for hours together, on his burning forehead, and
                        to know that her ever‐watchful devotion was around him; but as yet he had
                        never opened his lips.</p>
                    <p>At length one day she ventured to read to him,—it was the only service his
                        attendants could render him, which always appeared to give him pleasure,—it
                        drove away for the time the dark thoughts which well nigh maddened him, and
                        as Mrs. Hartley’s advanced age rendered her incapable of performing it,
                        Millicent was the more anxious to ascertain that she might so do without
                        risk of his discovering her. At the first sound of her voice he started
                        violently, but the very sight of this emotion<pb n="219"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-220"/> on his part, only made herself the more agitated,
                        and in the low, indistinct tones with which she continued to read, it did
                        indeed seem impossible that he should recognise the sweet, clear voice with
                        which of old she used to greet him. It was evident that he did become
                        reassured, and remained listening with quiet enjoyment to her reading; not
                        only it seemed to be like a soothing melody to his restless and wearied
                        soul, but there was apparently something in the soft tremulousness of that
                        voice, so full of the deep love she bore him, which moved him greatly, for
                        when she had concluded, he suddenly broke the sullen, stern silence of many
                        months, and said to her—</p>
                    <p>“I thank you very much,—I hope you will never leave me.”</p>
                    <p>Oh the tide of wild emotion that came gushing through her breast, as she thus
                        heard again the voice for which she had<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7184-221"/>
                        hungered and thirsted so long! she could not remain in the room, but fled
                        away, to give free vent to her agitation, by a happiness to which her poor
                        desolate heart was now so little accustomed,—for not only she had heard his
                        voice, but she had heard it addressing herself, in accents of kindness.</p>
                    <p>From that day she read to him constantly, and was with him always. He spoke
                        to her, but to her only, and that sparingly,—whenever any one else was in
                        the room he was invariably silent. He became impatient of any attention but
                        hers, and openly manifested the pleasure he had in her society.</p>
                    <p>No words can ever tell the intense joy all this was to Millicent Grey; it was
                        greater even, perhaps, than in the days when she had been his prosperous
                        bride, for then she had not felt that wearing sorrow which so enhances a
                        return of happiness; and now, too, she felt that the joy, mournful as it<pb
                            n="221" xml:id="VAB7184-222"/> would have seemed to any other, which she
                        experienced in ministering to him in his helpless state, was far more secure
                        than the rapturous delight of brighter times, for the frightful infirmities
                        which had cut him off from his former friends, and from the very world
                        itself, had shut her in, as it were, with him, into his dark solitude, and
                        delivered him up, by all others deserted, to her faithful care alone.</p>
                    <p>But soon, to her unspeakable delight, his health began to improve greatly
                        under her unremitting care. He was able at last to walk a few steps through
                        the room, leaning on her arm; both Millicent and Mrs. Hartley soon became
                        aware that this physical improvement, was chiefly the result of some change
                        which was taking place in his mind; an ingredient strangely like the sweet
                        leaven of hope, was plainly working in the spirit long so dead and
                        heavy.—Hope! but of what? It was not till<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7184-223"/>
                        Millicent had been with him two or three months, that the presence of this,
                        our angel of mercy, in his soul, became apparent, and with it his whole
                        manner and appearance altered. Millicent had taken the name of Mary, by
                        which he always called her; and once when he questioned Mrs. Hartley
                        respecting her, wishing to know who she was, and whence she came, she had so
                        resolutely abstained from giving him any information whatever, and had so
                        calmly answered, that she was merely a person whom she had provided to wait
                        upon him, that they were convinced no outward circumstance could in any way
                        arouse his suspicions.</p>
                    <p>Yet that they were aroused in some way was plain; the intense happiness it
                        evidently was to him to have her near him; the eagerness with which he
                        listened for her step; the mournful impatience which tormented him in her
                        brief absence; and<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7184-224"/> above all, the
                        peculiarly meaning smile, that often brightened on his countenance, when he
                        heard the tones of her voice, all showed abundantly that some strange idea
                        was working in his mind respecting her.</p>
                    <p>As these facts became day by day more evident, there was a deep, fluttering
                        delight which stole into the heart of Millicent Grey, and there abode,
                        making her often faint with excess of happiness; for if he suspected the
                        truth, as both she and Mrs. Hartley were inclined to believe, if he had
                        divined who she was, the discovery, beyond a doubt, had been one of
                        rapturous pleasure to him. Oh, if it were so, how was her deep, patient love
                        rewarded! What better, higher glory,—what dearer joy did she ask for life,
                        than to be allowed thus to watch over him in his helplessness until her
                        dying hour. And to do so not in secret, but with his own glad permission,
                        were to make for her this mortal existence a very vision of delight.</p>
                    <pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7184-225"/>
                    <p>But that even the hope, the sweet belief in the possibility of such
                        happiness, was too inexpressibly dear to be lightly risked, she would
                        already have made her happy confession to him, and learnt whether, in truth,
                        her bright dream was to be realized.</p>
                    <p>Besides, Mrs. Hartley counseled her to wait with patience till Aylmer should
                        himself explain what he really thought. When she remembered the passionate
                        agony of the tone in which he had uttered the first word after his accident,
                        Juliet’s name, she felt doubtful of any such sudden revulsion of
                        feeling.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, most restless and most miserable was Arthur Egerton, haunted by
                        the unhappy love on which he had staked, and as it seemed, lost his life,
                        even as a man is pursued by the spirit of one he has murdered. Day and
                        night, day and night wearily pondering, dreaming hopelessly, he wandered on
                        the mountains which surrounded<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7184-226"/> Millicent’s
                        dwelling; he had followed her to Switzerland, and she knew it. At times he
                        came to the châlet, but he could not remain long, all he saw and heard there
                        was too insupportable to him; and Mrs. Hartley was always terrified lest the
                        sound of his voice should reach Aylmer’s ear, as she knew that the vicinity
                        of Arthur would soon have betrayed Millicent’s presence to him.</p>
                    <p>It was inconceivable what this unhappy man suffered at sight of her devotion
                        to Aylmer, it drove him well‐nigh frantic with rage. What! was his true,
                        unchanging, fervent attachment, to be treated with scorn and indifference,
                        whilst the man who had crushed her with his base desertion, who even now,
                        perhaps, loved another but too fondly, was to receive unknowing the
                        outpouring of her whole soul’s deep tenderness, the offering of her very
                        life! Stephen Aylmer and he were more than equals now,<pb n="226"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-227"/> infinitely more frightful than his repulsive
                        countenance or ungainly figure was the poor crippled man’s appearance. And
                        the deadly hate that swelled up in Arthur’s heart towards Aylmer, had a
                        terrible power in goading him to a recklessness of evil, which a short time
                        since would have appalled himself; he was not, however, in any degree
                        quiescent in this state of unholy anguish. Day by day more deeply he swore
                        that, living or dying, Millicent Grey should yet be his,—or, at least, that
                        she should never be Stephen Aylmer’s.</p>

                    <p><hi>SOME</hi> weeks had passed while matters continued in this state, when
                        Millicent on entering Aylmer’s room one day found him in evident agitation.
                        She herself had prepared to come to him with a trembling anxiety, for they
                        had parted the evening before, after a conversation which had filled her
                        with mingled terror and hope. His health and spirits had continued to
                        improve manifestly, under the influence of her presence, and not of her
                        presence only, but of some secret and sweet belief connected with<pb n="228"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-229"/> her; he could not have failed to discern from the
                        first moment of her attendance on him, that hers was a service of love, and
                        it was very plain that he had not only pondered much, from <emph>whom</emph>
                        such a devotion of affection could have come, but that he had arrived at a
                        decided opinion on the matter.</p>
                    <p>This decision, whatever it might be, was one full of rapturous joy to him, as
                        every word and movement indicated when Millicent Grey was near him; but
                        latterly he had shown an impatience of the silence she still maintained,
                        which proved to them all, that concealment would soon be impossible.</p>
                    <p>The night before he began to talk to her of Rookcliffe, and she saw by the
                        manner in which he turned his head towards her, and the eager, watchful
                        expression of his face, that he had chosen this subject solely in order to
                        discover by the tone of her answer, whether it caused her any agitation;<pb
                            n="229" xml:id="VAB7184-230"/> he had reason to be abundantly satisfied,
                        for her voice shook, so that she could scarcely speak, and he almost felt in
                        the vibrating air the trembling of her frame as she stood beside him.</p>
                    <p>A sudden terror had taken possession of her—she saw that he was about to
                        speak again, and she doubted not it would be to demand the truth from her,
                        and she had hurried away to prevent it, for full of hope as she was, that he
                        had long since guessed the real state of the case, and had proved by his
                        evident happiness, how utterly her deep love and faithfulness had prevailed
                        at last over his wayward heart,—yet this summer‐time of hope had been so
                        inexpressibly sweet to her, that she dreaded any change, even were it to
                        richer blessings; she had known too much of misery—sudden, blighting misery,
                        not to cling to the present joy with a shrinking dread of aught that could
                        vary it in any way. She saw at a glance,<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7184-231"/>
                        however, on entering the room next morning, that this hour was to be
                        decisive; the manner in which he took her hand on her entrance, and held it
                        with a grasp from which she could not escape, showed that he was resolved
                        that she should not leave him without an explanation.</p>
                    <p>Millicent sat down on a low seat by his side—her accustomed place, and the
                        sightless eyes turned to her with an almost frightful anxiety, as though the
                        frantic desire of the soul could enable it even yet to look through those
                        darkened cavities. Meanwhile the grasp tightened on her hand; he spoke at
                        last, his voice was low and tremulous.</p>
                    <p>“I have been so longing for you, my light, my joy!”</p>
                    <p>She started; he had never called her by such terms before:—he went on:</p>
                    <p>“I shall never call you Mary again, it is a false title; you have a dearer
                        name for<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7184-232"/> me, my earthly guardian angel.”
                        Her heart throbbed so violently that she could scarce remain tranquil, but
                        his strong hand closed on hers and seemed to control her; she listened now
                        to what he said, entranced as when in dreams we hear a sweet unearthly
                        music.</p>
                    <p>“Listen, gentlest and tenderest of friends,” continued Aylmer. “I long to
                        tell you all that has been wandering through my heart this many a day,
                        breathing, as it were, new life within it. When you came to me,—a vision of
                        sweetest mercy, I was plunged in a despair for which earth has no parallel;
                        my longing eyes were shut up from the light of day—deprived for ever of
                        their rapturous delight in beauty, and my pining soul was exiled from the
                        light of life, deprived for ever of its intense enjoyment in that love which
                        is the moral beauty of this world. When you came with that soft tender hand,
                        that sweet voice, whose faintest tone breathed volumes of affection, which
                        it was unutterable<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7184-233"/> joy to me to hear; then
                        light and beauty both returned to my soul, for they were in the devoted,
                        disinterested love I felt you gave me. I knew, however, that it was no
                        stranger love which was around me, brightening every moment more and more
                        the blackness of darkness to which the wrath of heaven had consigned me! Had
                        it been,—(a thing incredible indeed!) some really new affection roused by
                        pity for me, it had but added a thousand‐fold to my great torment; for what
                        to me were the love in which I could not share, for which I felt no shadow
                        of a wish? valueless indeed, as is that sunshine now, on which I cannot
                        gaze, were the attachment in which I could feel no sympathy! But I knew it
                        was not so—with the very first sound of your voice there sprung into my soul
                        a hope brighter, dearer, more glorious, than any which ever shone upon my
                        days of pride—the hope, that one who loved me when we were in some sense
                        equals, now with a beautiful generosity, a<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7184-234"/>
                        faithfulness worthy to be crowned with noblest honour, had returned to the
                        poor, wretched, helpless cripple in his deep adversity, and sacrificed to
                        him the priceless treasure of her heart and life,—freely as though he were
                        not a very pauper in this world, more abject, more degraded, more utterly
                        stripped of all earthly good than the starving beggar who can see the
                        sun!”</p>
                    <p>“Sweet angel, as this hope brightened in my heart, no words can ever tell the
                        tide of matchless joy that gushed in with it; I felt, and I feel now, that
                        almost would I gladly sacrifice the sight of these blind eyes again, to have
                        so glorious, so unexampled a proof of that love which alone is precious to
                        me on this earth.”</p>
                    <p>“So very sweet that hope, I could not bear to change it even for a more
                        blessed assurance—but I have lived in your presence, happy,—as in the days
                        of light and joy—feeling that hour by hour, with your<pb n="234"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-235"/> most tender care and most devoted watchfulness,
                        you were twining yourself around my heart with a power which you never
                        possessed, even when I could claim you as my promised bride. Dearer grew
                        life, yes, even to the blind cripple how intensely dear! Fender, holier,
                        brighter grew your image in my soul, till I felt that ample was the
                        compensation for all that had been taken from me, in the gift my very
                        infirmities had procured me—of a love which could not otherwise have existed
                        in its utter unselfishness and generosity. I never thought you could be to
                        me, what you have been these last few months. I never thought in my time of
                        triumph, to feel for you the intensity of tenderness which now absorbs me;
                        therefore have you made my suffering truly a most blessed thing.”</p>
                    <p>“But now I can no longer be content with but the hope, however firm, I must
                        have the certainty—that certainty which shall make the blind man’s darkened
                        life, far brighter<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7184-236"/> than that of any who
                        look upon the light of heaven—that certainty without which I must even die!
                        for I can truly feel that my existence now is literally bound up in you.
                        Speak, then, you who are my life, say that I am right, that you
                        are—Juliet!”</p>
                    <p><emph rend="sc">JULIET</emph>!—those few minutes when Millicent Grey sat with
                        her hand in Stephen Aylmer’s, listening to those words of his which we have
                        just recorded, had been the happiest of her life—and that happiness had been
                        of a nature which it is rarely given to mortals to enjoy on this side
                        heaven—for she had firmly believed that he was speaking throughout of
                        herself. She imagined him to be fully aware of Juliet’s marriage (which had,
                        in fact, been concealed from him), and therefore it never occurred to her
                        that he could have so far deceived himself, as to have mistaken her for her
                        cousin. She had sat there hearing him speak of his perfect happiness, to
                            gain<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7184-237"/> which she had so toiled—a
                        fearful, painful toil—and hearing him say that he had obtained it by the
                        very means which was to secure her own—instead of his life being made
                        blessed only by the utter cursing of hers—and it had seemed to her while he
                        spoke that mercy had been at last extended to her, and that her great
                        prayer, into which her whole existence had been embodied for his well‐being
                        on earth, had been granted in such a way as to secure a bright joy for
                        herself.</p>
                    <p>She thought that her long sore trial was ended—that she who had been so
                        tossed on the deep waters of despair, so driven to and fro by storms of
                        misery, so chilled to the very soul by biting blasts of human cruelty, was
                        about to enter on her rest at last—and that even she had reason to rejoice
                        in all that had occurred, since it had wrought for her a far more perfect
                        joy—for he who had coldly loved her formerly, already spoke of the intensity
                        of tender‐<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7184-238"/> ness her deep devotion had
                        called forth. And now into the very ocean of calm and exquisite enjoyment in
                        which her soul had floated while he spoke, there came breathing in the name
                        of Juliet—that word of fearful import! even as the cry of “fire” sounds in
                        the startled mariner’s ears when the summer’s seas are all tranquillity, and
                        tells him that destruction is come upon him, and he is about to perish for
                        ever in the remorseless deep. She fell back, stricken down by that name,
                        almost as he had been by the thunder‐bolt, and by that movement, plucked her
                        hand from his grasp with sudden violence.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was startled, almost terrified—he raised himself on his elbow, and it
                        was sad to see the intense anxiety with which the force of habit sent the
                        poor sightless eyes wandering in search of her.</p>
                    <p>“Where are you?” he said, with a mournful cry. “What can have happened? Why
                        will you not speak? Think, think how my<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7184-239"/>
                        life is depending on your answer; it cannot be that I was mistaken—oh, it
                        cannot be that such anguish is preparing for me, such a dawn of hope to fade
                        into so black a night—but no, no—it is only that you are agitated, and so
                        cannot speak. I can hear your heart beating, I know that it is so, and I
                        know you are my own, my own Juliet. I could not mistake that dear voice, so
                        sweetly familiar.”</p>
                    <p>She shuddered violently—that fatal resemblance of voice, once before had cost
                        her agony—but now! Still she was silent, but for the convulsive drawing of
                        her breath, which he heard distinctly—the paleness of a deadly alarm spread
                        over his face—he stretched out his shaking hands, groping frantically in his
                        great darkness. At last he touched her; then he seized her by the arm; he
                        dragged her close to him; he passed his hand over her head and face—“Speak,
                        speak!” he said, in a hoarse whisper.<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7184-240"/> “Do
                        you know what you are doing? Do you know that you are killing, me? If you
                        are not Juliet Egerton, if you are not <emph rend="sc">MY</emph> Juliet, the
                        beloved of my heart, the light of my soul—the joy, the hope, the charm of my
                        life—I swear to you that I will not live—I <emph>will not</emph>! to be so
                        wretched, so accursed a thing—blind, baffled, miserable!” He almost shouted
                        the last word, and it roused her from her extreme agony to feel that she
                        must think—that she must decide what was to be done in this horrible
                        emergency; and again towering over the soul of Millicent Grey, over her
                        passion of distress, her almost delirium of suffering, there rose the one
                        desire, which had been the abiding principle of her existence, since first
                        she had looked on Stephen Aylmer—the desire for his happiness—this arose
                        predominant over all‐his words rung in her ears,—he would not live to endure
                        the misery of knowing he had been mistaken. She compared this with his<pb
                            n="240" xml:id="VAB7184-241"/> glad outpouring of joy a few minutes
                        before. He <emph>had</emph> been happy—how happy in the belief that she was
                        Juliet; and now, what a prospect of intolerable desolation was before him.
                        And wherefore should he endure it? Why should her revelation bring it darkly
                        upon him? He had been most unspeakably blest in a delusion—why should not
                        the delusion continue?—for months he had believed that Juliet was with
                        him—why should he not believe it, and rejoice in the thought to his dying
                        hour? What should prevent it but her own want of courage, of devotion, of
                        faithfulness, to perform so fearful a penance, as thus to personate for him
                        the rival he loved?</p>
                    <p>Millicent never thought of the falsehood such a plan must involve. Those who
                        worship their idols of flesh, soon forget the pure laws of a holier
                        faith.</p>
                    <p>She thought only that she had consecrated herself to his happiness, and
                            again<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7184-242"/> by martyrdom was she condemned
                        to obtain it.</p>
                    <p>There was no time for delay; the clinging hands were tightening frantically
                        upon her arm—the countenance of Aylmer was distorted with the most fearful
                        emotions.</p>
                    <p>She bowed her head, her spirit resigned itself—it delivered up its hope and
                        its joy as a man gives up life, and the breath on his lips. She accepted her
                        penance.</p>
                    <p>She pressed her lips to his hands that were cruelly crushing her own, and
                        whispered “I am her, indeed, who has loved you so well.”</p>
                    <p>How bitterly, long after, did she rue that perjury! but she thought not then
                        of the crime, remembering only that she was to be the instrument of his
                        peace, by what means soever that peace might be effected.</p>
                    <p>And he, the full tide of joy rushing back to his heart, assured that she was
                        Juliet indeed, how he tortured her soul with his<pb n="242"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-243"/> wild cry of delight,—how he caused her whole
                        frame to shiver, in the horrible mockery of the embrace bestowed on her for
                        the sake of another. She endured it for a while—then life seemed passing
                        away altogether, and she said,—“I am faint—let me go—I will return.”</p>
                    <p>And he released her. He thought in truth such joy was bewildering. She crept
                        away lost, hopeless, and in torture. Yet even then her thought was for him;
                        she must take care that no other took from him the joy she had given—fearful
                        the cost, and secure must the recompense be.</p>
                    <p>She went to Mrs. Hartley, she told her all—she besought her not to destroy
                        the poor blind man’s delusion. She said it was done,—it must be so,—that her
                        task was appointed now to the end of her days,—the, daily, hourly agony of
                        receiving his love for another. She said that his happiness was her own
                        right, her charge, her care, and<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7184-244"/> none must
                        dare tamper with it—had she not bought it with suffering such as human words
                        could not reveal? Mrs. Hartley hesitated long; she felt it was wrong to
                        permit a deceit, but she was a woman, and weak,—her heart was wrung by the
                        pleading of the desolate being now sobbing before her. She said she would
                        not affirm a falsehood, but she would not undeceive him.</p>
                    <p>Millicent thanked her for this permission to live a life of inconceivable
                        anguish, as though for the highest boon; and Mrs. Hartley ever dreading to
                        interfere in so dark and fearful a history, added in sorrowing accents,—“My
                        child, I fear you have taken to yourself a torture you will find
                        insupportable.”</p>

                    <p><hi>AND</hi> Mrs. Hartley was right; there was a torture beyond the power of
                        language to express, in the life Millicent Grey had chosen to herself, yet
                        not insupportable, nothing is insupportable to that love which alone
                        deserves the name, a love free from the least taint of selfishness.
                        Willingly she had accepted the sacrifice—willingly she performed it; but it
                        was not as formerly, one sharp fierce trial, one convulsive effort, and then
                        the calm of inaction; it was now the renewed and continued struggle of
                            every<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7184-246"/> moment, the fresh wound of each
                        hour, the daily offering up of self, with a bleeding and a broken heart.</p>
                    <p>The very excess of her suffering was in some sense sweet, because all was
                        endured for <emph>him</emph>, but it was in truth a very fearful penance, to
                        sit day after day by his side, and hear him give her every name of the
                        softest endearment, every assurance of that affection which alone could have
                        been her life’s sunshine and to know it was all designed for another! to
                        feel the loving grasp of his hand, and tremble to think how with that hand,
                        he would have driven her from him, had he known the truth;—to hear him
                        delight himself in giving her all the torturing details of his intense love
                        for her cousin, from the very first hour he had seen her,—to listen to his
                        declaration of exquisite unutterable happiness in the belief that Juliet was
                        near him, whose presence alone he desired in this world.</p>
                    <pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7184-247"/>
                    <p>Then, often, he would speak of Millicent herself, as of one whom he had never
                        really loved, but sought only to marry for his uncle’s pleasure; and who,
                        because of her indifference, or perhaps for the sake of Arthur Egerton, had
                        been so ready to give him up: he said that her coldness of heart was plainly
                        proved, since she had never so much as inquired after him since his fearful
                        accident; how different from his beautiful, his beloved Juliet, whose
                        unexampled devotion was lovely as her own sweet face,— whose pure generous
                        soul shared the beauty of her outward appearance! how thankful he was that
                        he had been saved from wedding Millicent Grey. He shuddered to think on the
                        anguish he would have suffered had he seen Juliet Egerton, when already the
                        husband of one he must have learnt to hate.</p>
                    <p>Poor Millicent wept very sore when he spoke thus, and if he felt her cold
                            cheek<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7184-248"/> wet with tears, he took it as
                        another proof of Juliet’s feeling heart, and lavished on her thanks and
                        praises that were but too torturing. It might have seemed that the woman’s
                        pride within her, would have revolted against such treatment, but pride
                        could have no place in presence of such frightful infirmities as those which
                        were laid on Stephen Aylmer;—her deep humility of devotion could never be
                        degrading, when offered to so miserable, so unsightly an object of
                        compassion as he had become.</p>
                    <p>In the deceit she was now practicing, Millicent Grey had made that fatal
                        mistake, that subtle but most unrighteous error, which supposes that
                        self‐sacrifice or a noble generous aim can <emph>sanctify a
                        falsehood</emph>. Many crimes have been committed, not of falsehood only,
                        but of deeper dye, by means of this fallacy, so inviting to ardent and
                        misguided minds.</p>
                    <p>But Millicent soon found, as must ever be<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7184-249"/>
                        the case with any deviation from truth, that she had involved herself in a
                        labyrinth of difficulty. Aylmer had constantly asked her to assure him again
                        and again, that she had told him only what was her determined resolution,
                        when she had promised to devote her life to him, and this she could with all
                        truth affirm, for she did love, and designed to live, in and for him
                        only.</p>
                    <p>Gradually he made it manifest for what purpose he had sought this assurance;
                        he said if it were so, if really he was to be so unspeakably blest as that
                        she should never quit him more, she must take the sanction of his name, she
                        must assume the title that once had been so nearly hers, and become his
                        wife.</p>
                    <p>It may be imagined what terror there was in this proposal to the wretched
                        Millicent; it was utterly impossible to carry the deceit so far as to let
                        him marry her under his present delusion, and yet it was<pb n="249"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-250"/> both difficult and bitterly painful to refuse
                        him; for whilst in her own rightful person she would have been too thankful
                        to have thus bound herself more irrevocably to the care of his existence, in
                        her strange and peculiar position he could only attribute her hesitation to
                        a repugnance against a marriage with one so unfortunate; thus believing her
                        withheld by the very infirmities and helplessness, which would have drawn
                        her in actual fact more closely to him.</p>
                    <p>Aylmer did not reproach her for her refusal, but she saw that he felt it
                        deeply, and this cut her to the very heart.</p>
                    <p>Still, the days and weeks, and even months went on, whilst they continued to
                        lead this painful and unnatural existence; but Millicent little thought the
                        while how the very ground beneath her feet was being undermined.</p>
                    <p>It will not be supposed that Arthur<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7184-251"/>
                        Egerton, with his fierce will, and subtle mind, could remain inactive or
                        content with an arrangement which rendered Stephen Aylmer perfectly happy in
                        the entire enjoyment of Millicent’s society, and bound herself to him as
                        with an indissoluble tie. From the first moment when Arthur heard of the
                        extraordinary system of deception into which Millicent had been drawn
                        unawares, be saw therein a bright hope for himself.</p>
                    <p>Knowing Stephen Aylmer to be thoroughly convinced that it was indeed Juliet,
                        the only being he had ever really loved, who was giving him hourly proofs of
                        such unequaled affection, Arthur felt certain that the disappointment, if
                        ever he discovered his mistake, would be so terrible and so bitter, that the
                        angry man would not scruple to cast off poor Millicent for ever.</p>
                    <p>Ungoverned passion is a fearful thing, and Arthur knew its power too well in
                        his own soul, not to judge accurately enough of<pb n="251"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-252"/> its effect in others; he had never yet been
                        allowed to see Aylmer, but he heard enough in his visits to Mrs. Hartley, to
                        show him that the blind man was becoming day by day more absorbed in the
                        happiness which he believed he derived, from the presence and the affection
                        of Juliet only—so that to find how, in actual fact, she was far distant from
                        him, would be to plunge him in a despair over which the unhappy Millicent
                        could have no power. Arthur’s great object, therefore, was to undeceive the
                        blind man as soon as might be. Strange! to think that to this cruel,
                        unrelenting persecution of one most unfortunate, he should have given the
                        holy name of love! He would have dealt more tenderly by Millicent Grey, had
                        he long since driven a knife into her heart, than thus by repeated blows to
                        pierce her, ever living, to its very core.</p>
                    <p>He found it by no means an easy matter to effect his purpose. Millicent had
                            pre‐<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7184-253"/> vented him even seeing Aylmer,
                        lest some unguarded word from him should betray the truth; and although he
                        was fully determined to steal into his presence whenever he had an
                        opportunity of doing so unobserved; yet as Mrs. Hartley or herself were
                        always with him, this was not soon accomplished.</p>
                    <p>One day, however, when some months had elapsed, in which the blind man had
                        lived most happy in his sweet delusion, Arthur Egerton found means to
                        penetrate into his appartment. Mrs. Hartly had gone out—and he had by a
                        stratagem succeeded in having Millicent sent for to speak to some person on
                        business in another part of the house.</p>
                    <p>Then he stole like a stealthy serpent into the blind man’s room.</p>
                    <p>For a moment Arthur Egerton stood appalled at the sight he saw—he remembered
                        so well the pride, and the beauty, and<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7184-254"/> the
                        strength of that deformed repulsive‐looking being. Yet, with that wreck of
                        humanity before him, telling of what elements this life’s treasures are
                        composed, he went on, preparing to devote, and, perhaps unawares to
                        sacrifice altogether, his deathless soul for the attainment of an earthly
                        good. Remembering he had no time to lose, he went up and took Aylmer by the
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>He asked him if he recollected him, and inquired, with much apparent
                        kindness, respecting the state of his health.</p>
                    <p>“Arthur Egerton, is it not?” exclaimed Aylmer. “I recognised your voice; I
                        have been wishing much that some of Juliet’s family should visit us; I am
                        very glad you are come.”</p>
                    <p>Arthur was delighted to hear him in his very sentence introduce the subject
                        on which he wished to speak. It was necessary that he should give his
                        information speedily, as Millicent was certain to return soon.</p>
                    <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7184-255"/>
                    <p>“I am truly happy to see you, my dear Aylmer,” he replied; “I fear, however,
                        I can give you no news of Juliet which will be agreeable to you.”</p>
                    <p>“News of Juliet!” exclaimed Aylmer. “Arthur, what can you mean? how should I
                        require news of her when she is with me every hour of the day?”</p>
                    <p>“Juliet with you?” replied Arthur, throwing into his voice a well‐feigned
                        expression of surprise; “you must be labouring under some extraordinary
                        mistake. My sister is not here, I can assure you.”</p>
                    <p>“That is, you are not aware of it; you are but just arrived, and it is plain
                        she has concealed from you that she has been with us these many months; but
                        it is best there should be no such mysteries. I will persuade her to see
                        you, and tell you all the truth to‐day.”</p>
                    <p>“Aylmer,” said Arthur, with great decision and solemnity, “I know not what<pb
                            n="255" xml:id="VAB7184-256"/> motive they have for thus grossly
                        deceiving you, but I give you my word of honour that Juliet Egerton is not
                        and never has been here; she is in Italy, where I saw her not long since,
                        and whence I received a letter from her this morning; I can read it to you
                        if you like, as a proof that I tell the plain truth.”</p>
                    <p>He was careful not to tell she was married; it might have induced Aylmer more
                        readily to forgive poor Millicent. An expression of the wildest agitation
                        had passed over the face of the blind man; he started up, the darkened eyes
                        staring wide open.</p>
                    <p>“In the name of mercy, what is it you say?” he exclaimed; “am I to doubt the
                        evidence of my own senses? it is not half an hour since Juliet left the
                        room—”</p>
                    <p>“Aylmer, I grieve to remind you of it; but you must remember that you are
                        deprived of the use of that sense which could alone enable you to ascertain
                        the truth on<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7184-257"/> this point. I repeat to you,
                        and indeed it were best for you to receive the fact, however painful—you are
                        deceived, cruelly deceived—Juliet has never been here.”</p>
                    <p>“But I know her voice—the touch of her hand, Arthur; I tell you she has been
                        at my side for hours, and answered even to that name.”</p>
                    <p>“There is often a strange resemblance in voices, and where there is the
                        premeditated resolution to mislead one blind as you are, it is not a
                        difficult matter; but it is needless for you to argue the point any further
                        with me. I tell you I have been here for months, and constantly in this
                        house, only they would not let me see you, lest I should act a friend’s part
                        by you, and undeceive you. I have watched the person who represents Juliet
                        for you; I know who she is, for I have seen her face day by day, though you
                        could not.”</p>
                    <p>There was an evident truthfulness in this<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7184-258"/>
                        last speech of Arthur’s, which suddenly carried complete conviction to the
                        mind of Aylmer. He no longer doubted that it was even so—that he had been
                        utterly deceived, and that all the intense, most exquisite happiness he had
                        enjoyed in the society of her he believed to be his Juliet, his living ideal
                        of glorious beauty, was in truth but a false and bitter mockery. If a man,
                        by a single word, could suddenly call up the whirlwind out of a summer sky,
                        and were unexpectedly to see the raging tempest springing up at his own
                        unguarded wish, he could not be more utterly appalled than was Arthur
                        Egerton, when he saw the horrible expression of frantic rage, that now
                        distorted the features of the unhappy Aylmer.</p>
                    <p>All that had been deepest joy to him, in the delusion thus rudely destroyed,
                        all that was horror, darkness, and despair in the prospect of his life
                        without it, had gathered<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7184-259"/> itself up into
                        one fierce passion of unrestrained tremendous anger against her who had
                        practised this deceit upon him. He had ever been of fiery temper, he could
                        ill brook contradiction even in his best days,—and now to find that
                        advantage had been taken of his very infirmity to mislead him, and prepare
                        for him an agony of disappointment, against which his whole soul revolted,
                        as the body would shrink from the rack itself,—was so maddening a discovery,
                        that it flung him into a convulsion of rage, full of the one wild desire to
                        wreak his vengeance on the false Juliet who had betrayed him. The violence
                        of his passion impeded his speech for a few minutes; then his countenance
                        became livid with its excess, and he burst out in a tone that almost struck
                        terror to the heart even of the strong man before him—</p>
                    <p>“Who is she then, where is she, who has dared to deceive me, that base, most
                            treach‐<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7184-260"/> erous, being—who is she, that
                        I may know whom to hate, with all the power of the false love I felt for
                        her, turned now to deadliest poison?”</p>
                    <p>“She is here to speak for herself,” muttered Arthur, shaking from head to
                        foot, as he suddenly perceived that Millicent had entered unperceived, and
                        was standing close to the blind man, with her horror‐dilated eyes fixed full
                        on his face. She had heard Aylmer’s terrible speech.</p>
                    <p>“Here!” he exclaimed, and stretched out his hand; it fell on the shoulder of
                        Millicent, and closed on it with a grasp fierce and cruel as that of a
                        tiger. He dragged her to him with such violence that she fell to the ground;
                        then he shouted in her ear with a voice more awful to her than the thunders
                        in their wrath, “Who are you—what are you—impostor, deceiver—that have dared
                        to betray the blind man? Vile hypocrite, creeping here with your soft<pb
                            n="260" xml:id="VAB7184-261"/> lying words, to steal my heart’s love on
                        such false pretences. Speak, is it true, has he spoken the truth?—which of
                        you has lied to bring a curse on your heads, for baffling the blind?—are you
                        not Juliet Egerton, my only beloved?”</p>
                    <p>“Forgive, forgive,” gasped Millicent, in convulsions of anguish and fear.</p>
                    <p>“Forgive! is there ever forgiveness for a deed like this? I will know who you
                        are, most wretched impostor; speak at once—lest in my fury I take from you
                        the power of speaking for ever—who are you?”</p>
                    <p>“Millicent!” She felt as if her heart’s blood gushed out with that name.</p>
                    <p>“Millicent!” It seemed as though a lingering of hope had remained for him
                        till that word was spoken; and now all was blackness in the spirit, where
                        hope and joy reigned so brightly before.</p>
                    <p>With all the force of his strong hand he flung her away, as a thing too
                        worthless to<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7184-262"/> claim another thought, and
                        then bowing his face on his hands, he gave way to irrepressible sorrow,
                        crying out for Juliet, Juliet —his own, his only love—beseeching her to
                        come, wafting and lamenting in uttermost desolation. Millicent had gone
                        reeling from his heavy hand till she fell against the wall, and sunk to the
                        ground stunned and bruised with the blow; but that voice, the fatal name of
                        Juliet breathed in such accents of mournful tenderness, recalled her to the
                        bitterness of life. She could no more endure those sounds, than a criminal
                        on the scaffold could have borne the insults of the exulting people. She
                        rose and staggered out; as she passed Arthur, she turned her wan face, where
                        the prayer for death was written in legible characters, and cast on him one
                        look of gentlest, most touching reproach—</p>
                    <p>That look was with him to his dying day; and years after, when he was sinking
                        in his<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7184-263"/> mortal sickness, he told one who
                        watched by him, that he believed that white face, with its pale dumb lips,
                        and awfully eloquent eyes, would look at him through the coffin lid. So
                        Millicent Grey wandered away from the house, no one knew whither, and Arthur
                        Egerton, who saw not which way she went, fled in the opposite direction,
                        appalled and yet exulting at all he had done.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> Mrs. Hartley returned she found only Stephen Aylmer within the
                        house, in a state of mind which baffled all description. She guessed what
                        happened, but he told her all in detail; and his fury returning as he
                        thought how bright had been the dream, how bitter the waking, he repeated
                        the cruel words he had used to the wretched Millicent.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley could scarcely contain her indignation, when she heard how he
                        had treated that generous faithful friend. Poor<pb n="264"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-265"/> Millicent had erred certainly in departing from
                        the truth, but was <emph>he</emph> the one to punish her so fiercely for the
                        error that had sprung out of the patient love he inspired? His aunt saw it
                        was time he should learn to know the value of that true heart’s rare and
                        devoted affection, and that the mask should be stripped from the false
                        worldly being he worshipped so madly.</p>
                    <p>With a tone of solemnity which forcibly arrested his attention, she told him
                        to compose himself, and listen to the truth of his own life, which had been
                        since the hour he met Juliet Egerton presented to him in such false colours,
                        that he had fallen into those grievous errors, whereby he had utterly
                        destroyed his own peace and that of others.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley knew Juliet’s real character most thoroughly,—one of her own
                        married daughters had known both her, and the Marchesa with whom she had
                        lived at Milan very intimately, and had detailed to her<pb n="265"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-266"/> mother the whole circumstances of Juliet’s
                        conduct there, which was in no case at all favourable to her. This lady had
                        also fortunately a full acquaintance with all the particulars of her first
                        conversation with Aylmer, as the Marchesa who was her rival in reality,
                        though her friend in name, had not scrupled, after Miss Egerton’s departure
                        for England, to tell all who cared to know, the history of that deep‐laid
                        scheme, to entrap by a little artful mystery, the inaccessible Englishman,
                        supposed heir to so immense a fortune. When Mrs. Hartley wrote, therefore,
                        asking the real facts of this mysterious acquaintance of Aylmer and Juliet,
                        from which they assumed a right to act in so strange a manner at
                        Rookcliffe,—her daughter was able to give her a faithful account of it, with
                        a deep insight into Juliet’s subtle mind and hateful character.</p>
                    <p>And now Mrs. Hartley began from the very commencement, and detailed all this
                            to<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7184-267"/> Aylmer. She cared not what pain it
                        cost him. Truth, and truth alone, must be sought for now. She displayed to
                        him with a clearness which he could not misdoubt, the vile calculations
                        which had induced Juliet to detach him from Millicent,—she showed beyond the
                        possibility of mistake, that there had not been a gleam of love in that
                        false heart for him, and she contrasted that coldness veiled in a hideous
                        mockery of affection with the very ocean of pure deep tenderness, which
                        Millicent Grey had once devoted to him, and never recalled. He had not
                        understood it, even in the days when he was prepared to marry her, because
                        in truth it was too sacred, too intense and adoring a feeling to be
                        displayed, even to his own gaze; but Mrs. Hartley told him now, of all that
                        true heart suffered,—how often she had come to her fainting with sorrow, and
                        how the principle she had set before herself, as the object of her being,
                        was only to labour and toil for his happiness.</p>
                    <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7184-268"/>
                    <p>She described what that toil had been, racking her soul as the limbs of the
                        poor slave are racked at his work, and how up to this hour in desolation and
                        faintness, poor Millicent wrought still, to accomplish this end.</p>
                    <p>She explained the history of their parting, telling how Millicent had seen
                        his own letter, and straightway for the accomplishment of his peace on
                        earth, (that deep desire of her spirit) consented to slay her own hopes and
                        give herself up to the worst desolation.</p>
                    <p>She spoke of her that evening at Milton Lodge, when Aylmer in his delirium of
                        joy and Juliet in her insolent triumph, thought nothing of her, who had
                        bought it all for them by the death‐like anguish she then was enduring. Mrs.
                        Hartley passed on to the time of his accident; she detailed Juliet’s conduct
                        so revolting and heartless; and she saw that he writhed under her words,<pb
                            n="268" xml:id="VAB7184-269"/> but <emph>she</emph> heeded it not; she
                        went on to tell how she who had promised to be his wife for better for
                        worse, had demanded at last to see him in his helpless condition alone. Mrs.
                        Hartley said, during that interview she had entered the room unperceived,
                        and had seen Juliet standing over him, with a countenance where contempt and
                        disgust were struggling together. Aylmer uttered a cry of torture at these
                        words, yet he seemed fascinated by her recital, and still she went on:
                        Juliet passed her, she said, and went out of the room, disdainfully tossing
                        that beautiful head; she departed for Italy, and now she had long been
                        another man’s wife—married!</p>
                    <p>As this intelligence rang on his ear, Aylmer felt as though the lightning bad
                        struck him again—but this blow was <emph>more</emph> fearful than that of
                        the thunderbolt, for that had but quenched for him the natural light, and
                        this drove his soul into the darkness of night.<pb n="269"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-270"/> But still the solemn voice went sounding its
                        fearful details, and he seemed compelled to listen as to the sentence of
                        fate.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley spoke now of Millicent, of her patient agony in the solitude of
                        her home at Aix. It was soothing to Aylmer as a sweet strain of music, to
                        hear of such love, when his breast was convulsed with the knowledge of
                        Juliet’s defection; it was touching to hear the scene of Millicent’s arrival
                        at the châlet, to know with what a beautiful love and respect she knelt down
                        to kiss the feet of the blind man in his helplessness. Aylmer knew more
                        truly than Mrs. Hartley could tell, how tenderly Millicent had cared for him
                        since then, and how the days and the hours had past when she lived but to
                        minister to him; then she bid him recall all he said, when he told her he
                        believed she was Juliet, which Millicent never suspected, and how not only
                        it seemed that the happiness she laboured to gain him<pb n="270"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-271"/> would be lost for ever if his delusion were
                        destroyed, but that even he affirmed most solemnly, his very life must
                        depart, if this sweet dream went from him.</p>
                    <p>Poor Millicent was but a woman, weak, timid, and trusting; she believed he
                        would die, or she believed if he did live, it would be to great misery—there
                        seemed no other means of preserving his peace, or gaining his happiness but
                        by this continued delusion; she thought only of the bitterness of the trial
                        to herself, and not of the error—and precisely because it <emph>was</emph>
                        so bitter, because the sacrifice was so fearful, she believed her devoted
                        love was designed to accomplish it—and so she had taken upon herself, for
                        his sake, an existence of torture. And Aylmer again knew better than all how
                        unrepiningly she performed her terrible task—how, without a murmur, she
                        heard his deep words of love for another, and listened with only the tears
                        falling silent, to his aspersions on her own undying affection,</p>
                    <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7184-272"/>
                    <p>“And now, Stephen,” said Mrs. Hartley, as she concluded, “you know and
                        understand what has been and is, that love in its most generous tenderness,
                        which this day you have punished so heavily.”</p>
                    <p>Aylmer was deeply moved, but almost too much bewildered, with mingled sorrow
                        and remorse to speak or to think. Mrs. Hartley left him; she was anxious to
                        find the unhappy Millicent, for she almost believed from his manner she
                        might speak words of hope to her—but she sought her in vain, she was not in
                        the house, and no one hew where she was. One of the servants had seen her
                        creeping out of the châlet, when her ghastly appearance had terrified the
                        woman, who had already been alarmed at the sounds of vehement passion which
                        had burst from Aylmer’s room; she had watched Millicent wandering away, with
                        feeble and uncertain steps into the woods, and then she had seen her no
                        more. Mrs. Hartley became exces‐<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7184-273"/> sively
                        anxious when she heard this account; she knew that Millicent must have been
                        in a most fearful state of anguish, and she trembled for her reason, or the
                        results of a momentary madness of grief. She dispatched the servants in all
                        directions to seek her, and went herself to Arthur’s abode, which was not
                        far distant, in the hope that he might have followed; <corr>here</corr> but
                        she found him stretched on his sofa in a deep sleep of exhaustion, for often
                        he wandered the live‐long night round Millicent’s dwelling, and only
                        snatched a few hours of rest by day.</p>
                    <p>He was startled beyond measure when he heard she had not returned; he himself
                        had not seen her since she quitted the house; but full of terror now at
                        thought of all that might occur, if with his own hand he had driven her
                        desperate, he rushed down into the woods to seek her.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley returned in extreme agitation, and along with the servants
                            sought<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7184-274"/> vainly for Millicent till
                        nightfall. It had been early morning when she had gone wandering forth in
                        her great despair,—driven out by the cruel hand she so often had kissed, and
                        now the darkness was come, and where was she seeking her rest that
                        night?</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley sent for a party of peasants, who were to search the woods and
                        drag the rivers till morning; whilst she waited their arrival, she went for
                        a few minutes to Aylmer, who had sent for her repeatedly.</p>
                    <p>“What is all this?” he said to her, in a voice full of agitation, “where is
                        Millicent?”</p>
                    <p>“Who can tell,” said Mrs. Hartley, the tears streaming from her eyes as she
                        spoke; “perhaps she is resting now, as living she never has rested! My poor
                        child, my poor gentle child—it has been a cruel world to her!”</p>
                    <p>Aylmer shivered in every limb, and the cold dew stood on his forehead.</p>
                    <pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7184-275"/>
                    <p>“In the name of mercy,” he said, “you do not mean—” his lips refused to
                        articulate further.</p>
                    <p>“I do not know,” replied Mrs. Hartley, “none can know anything as yet, but my
                        heart misgives me—death, natural or by the violence of insanity, seems the
                        only termination one can imagine to such anguish as hers must have been.”
                        She made no attempt to spare the feelings of Aylmer in speaking thus, though
                        she saw he was suffering torments; his conduct aggravated in her eyes, by
                        the fatal result she dreaded, had seemed to her so heartless and cruel, that
                        she could scarce believe him capable of much feeling now, or overcome the
                        indignation she felt.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley was wrong, however, in thinking Aylmer heartless or naturally
                        cruel; he was a man of passionate temper, and the violent disappointment he
                        experienced, had goaded him into a passing<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7184-276"/>
                        madness; but the truth of the whole matter had now risen clear on his soul;
                        he saw what Juliet was—he understood what Millicent had been,—if indeed her
                        young life had expired in the excess of her sorrow; and the deep, fearful
                        remorse which took possession of him, as Mrs. Hartley left him, might truly
                        have expiated, in its bitter intensity, the errors he had so carelessly
                        committed.</p>
                    <p>It was a most awful night he passed. All that Millicent had done for him, all
                        her precious unexampled love, rose up before him with an agonizing
                        truthfulness of detail. Never, never again in this world—he felt it
                        deeply—would he find one to love him as she had done! and after all, the
                        being he had so fondly cherished for these last six months, because of her
                        tender care, her matchless devotion to himself,—the being to whom his
                        desolate heart had clung, as never to Juliet in the time of his triumphant
                        happiness, was Millicent in very truth, and not<pb n="276"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-277"/> as he had imagined—Juliet, softened and ennobled
                        by a generous affection to a poor and helpless cripple. What mattered it to
                        the blind man, that the tender guardian of his life and happiness, these
                        many months, possessed not the radiant beauty which had charmed the artist’s
                        eye, nor bore the name which once for him contained the promise of all
                        earth’s joy?</p>
                    <p>Whoever, whatever she might be that, angel‐like, had tended him with such a
                        loving mercy, she was still the friend, who by her disinterested tenderness
                        had drawn his very soul towards her in grateful, true affection; he had felt
                        by a natural, though mistaken fancy, when he found that as Juliet, she did
                        not exist for him, as though he must lose her altogether,—and that the
                        happiness he had derived from her society under that name, must utterly pass
                        away, when he was told she had no claim to it. He saw now what utter folly
                        his was: the indi‐<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7184-278"/> vidual he had loved, as
                        of necessity, ever since she came to him, a living sunbeam in his great
                        darkness, was still the same,—and still would have been ready, no doubt, to
                        have blest him with her loving care, had he not, (so to speak,) trampled her
                        under his feet, in punishment of her very love’s excess.</p>
                    <p>It is certain that Stephen Aylmer would not so soon have experienced this
                        revulsion of feeling, had he not been made aware of Juliet’s real character
                        which to him, with his great refinement of mind, was most revolting in its
                        peculiar qualities; and likewise a most powerful effect had been produced
                        upon him by Mrs. Hartley’s evident conviction, that his harshness had most
                        literally broken the heart of the unhappy being, who had sacrificed to him
                        her all of life, and died at last as it were at his command.</p>
                    <p>Stern indeed must be the man who could hear unmoved, that the heart which
                            loved<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7184-279"/> him best on earth, is cold in
                        death, never more to beat in warm throbbing as it has beat for him;
                        priceless then becomes the humble clinging love he lightly held, or
                        carelessly repulsed before. Bitter grows his longing, to feel but once again
                        the loving pressure of the hand, for ever stiff and lifeless—from which too
                        often his own has been withdrawn. And Stephen felt with an intensity of
                        mournful regret, that he would have given all on earth to have had once more
                        those gentle arms supporting his aching head; he thought with horror
                        unspeakable of the violence he had used to that shrinking frame, when he
                        flung her from him in his cruel passion,—and the strong, heavy hand lay on
                        his breast like molten lead, when he remembered, that with its weight he had
                        driven her out to her untimely grave.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to him so piteous a thing, to think of this poor stricken creature,
                            loaded<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7184-280"/> with the curse of his unkind
                        rebuke—wandering away into the green woods, to die there like a wounded bird
                        beneath some tree; and this was the image, that through that long night of
                        watching, presented itself again and again to his remorseful soul.</p>
                    <p>Morning came at length, and with it Mrs. Hartley, merely to tell him in a
                        voice choked with sobs, that no tidings of poor Millicent had been obtained.
                        Aylmer could not speak, his self‐abhorrence was so intense—he started up to
                        seek her, and die with her if need be’, then remembering the blindness, the
                        helplessness that chained him to his couch, he fell back in an agony of most
                        impotent sorrow. Mrs. Hartley, who was utterly exhausted and now almost
                        despairing, sat down for a few minutes to think what further efforts should
                        be made, however hopeless she feared them to be—and there was a complete
                        silence in the<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7184-281"/> room, whilst they remained
                        together absorbed in their bitter thoughts.</p>
                    <p>It was during this stillness, that both of them suddenly heard the measured
                        tramp as of many feet, coming along the path which led past the windows to
                        the house. Mrs. Hartley perceived at the same time, and in an under tone
                        communicated to Stephen, that a party of peasants, carrying a sort of
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">brancard</foreign>, had entered the hall.</p>
                    <p>Intense agitation rendered them both motionless. She endeavoured to rise,
                        that she might go to meet them, but all power had deserted her aged limbs,
                        and she could only wait listening to the ominous sounds without. Aylmer’s
                        condition was fearful, blind and palsied in such a moment, it was as though
                        he were chained down with bands of iron. The peasants, finding no one in the
                        outer rooms, came on with their burden to that of Aylmer; the door
                        opened,—slowly the tramping footsteps<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7184-282"/>
                        entered; they carried amongst them a rude litter, formed of branches roughly
                        cut, and upon it, gathered into a heap, lay a fragile form, altogether
                        motionless, her clinging garments wet with the dews of night, her dripping
                        hair veiling the pallid face; one cold white hand hung down, and seemed to
                        have beat against the stones as they bore her on, for it was cut and
                        bruised.</p>
                    <p>“Is she dead?” sobbed Mrs. Hartley, falling on her knees beside the litter,
                        and hiding her face on Millicent’s arm, that she might not look on so
                        piteous a spectacle.</p>
                    <p>“Not dead, we hope, as yet,” said one of the peasants, “her pulse fluttered a
                        little when we raised her, but she is altogether senseless.”</p>
                    <p>“We found her lying just as you see here, under one of the forest trees,”
                        said another, “and we think she must have lain thus motionless all night,
                        for the leaves which the wind has swept down since last evening, had
                        gathered in a heap on her head<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7184-283"/> and
                        face;—her breath had not stirred them.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley took courage then to look upon her, as these words seemed to
                        give some hope, and gently lifted the wet hair from the sweet face she had
                        so loved to gaze upon. Millicent was like a marble statue, colourless and
                        rigid,—no breath on the white lips, not a shiver in the blue‐veined eyelids,
                        sternly closed. Mrs. Hartley saw that she was in a death‐like trance, from
                        which it was doubtful if ever she would awake. She understood it all.
                        Stricken at heart, sinking under the load of his bitter reproach, she had
                        gone staggering out; and as, darker and darker, rose the thought of his hate
                        upon her soul, and the memory of the intense love with which he had uttered
                        Juliet’s name, the life had seemed to ebb back from her breast,—for there is
                        a limit to human suffering, there is a point at which the frail powers
                        within us can endure no more,—and then her<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7184-284"/>
                        fainting soul had given way. This mercy was extended to her that she ceased
                        to feel.</p>
                    <p>She had fallen down senseless, motionless, among the stones and thorns,
                        beneath the rocking branches of the forest trees,—and there, the livelong
                        night, that desolate child had lain. The dews of heaven had wet her pallid
                        face, the mountain winds had beat around her helpless form,—the thorns had
                        pierced her,—the night air had chilled her to the heart, but she neither
                        felt nor heeded nature’s persecution; for colder, keener than the mountain
                        air, more dread than the mountain blast, sharper than the merciless thorns,
                        and poisonous as ever midnight dew, was the one deadly thought that struck
                        her down, perhaps to perish there—the thought of his revealed hate.</p>
                    <p>The peasants’ task was now complete; with many a look of lingering pity on
                            that<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7184-285"/> hapless being, they took their
                        leave, and Mrs. Hartley, restored to energy by hope, went to seek
                        restoratives which might <corr>recall</corr> poor Millicent to life.</p>
                    <p>When she returned she found that Aylmer, who had listened in silent agitation
                        to all that passed, had groped his way to the spot where Millicent lay, and
                        had fallen on his knees beside her. He had raised her head, and wound his
                        arms round her; he was calling her now by every most endearing term,
                        breathing on the cold lips, that his warm breath might <corr>recall</corr>
                        hers, holding the chill, wet hands in his bosom,—and Mrs. Hartley paused
                        with a feeling of awe, for she felt there was a stronger power at work to
                            <corr>recall</corr> the ebbing life of Millicent Grey than any she could
                        use. The declaration of Stephen Aylmer’s hate and anger, had brought her to
                        the verge of death—would the expression of his love restore her? It was even
                        so. The<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7184-286"/> deadly paralysis relaxed in the
                        heart that faintly began to beat against his own,—the chilled breast softly
                        warmed with its first faint sigh,—the poor glazed eyes opened with a dim
                        wandering gaze, as the fluttering lids rose and fell, and settled at last on
                        the face of him so awfully beloved, whilst he bent over her with intense
                        affection.</p>
                    <p>She seemed utterly bewildered, her senses had evidently not returned fully,
                        only she was conscious on what arm she lay, and a sense of unutterable
                        sweetness of repose passed through her soul. She nestled closer to him, and
                        her eyes closed again, as if thus to die, were rapture beyond all words, and
                        the yet feeble life seemed almost to forsake her, for she fainted again.</p>
                    <p>But now the swoon was only temporary, his voice had fully restored her to
                        existence, and Mrs. Hartley carried her away to administer the care which at
                        last was very necessary.</p>
                    <pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7184-287"/>
                    <p>A serious illness was the consequence of Millicent’s exposure to the night
                        air, and during its duration, Aylmer seemed to live for her alone; when he
                        was not allowed to be with her, he lay at the threshold of her door, and
                        there could be no doubt that her recovery was greatly facilitated, by the
                        consciousness that his love had at last come forth abundantly to answer
                        hers.</p>
                    <p>Yet when, after she was fully restored to health, he pleaded with her, that
                        now, at length, after such storms and weary conflicts, they might both pass
                        into a haven of rest in their mutual affection; when he besought her to
                        become his wife, and terminate for ever the desolation in which both had
                        suffered much, it was Millicent who shrunk from a union, and hesitated to
                        give the promise he so longed for.</p>
                    <p>Not that she feared him, or that her deathless affection was diminished one
                        iota, but that at last the natural dignity of the<pb n="287"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-288"/> woman was roused within her; she could not forget
                        the tone of his voice when he shrieked out Juliet’s name. It seemed her, who
                        had never known a shadow of change, in her true heart, that he could not
                        have turned such passionate affection back to her again; she did not
                        understand how much of delusion there had been in his love for Juliet, how
                        deep‐seated the tenderness which her own noble character had raised in his
                        breast, since his blindness proved her worth to him. She feared it might be
                        compassion which had caused the change within him, that else would have
                        rendered her so supremely happy. And what woman could endure such a thought
                        as this! most deeply it rankled in poor Millicent’s heart after all her
                        trials.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hartley and Aylmer long combated the idea vainly; It was in truth most
                        utterly false; Aylmer valued and loved her now as she deserved, and esteemed
                            the<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7184-289"/> treasure of her noble heart as a
                        gift beyond all earthly price. Gradually this truth, so apparent in every
                        word he uttered, found its way convincingly to her mind; but it was not
                        until one day, when with all the eloquence of real feeling, he pleaded his
                        infirmities as a claim upon her charity, that she yielded, and became once
                        more his promised wife.</p>

                    <p><hi>IT</hi> would have been hard to have found in the wide world two happier
                        beings than Millicent Grey and Stephen Aylmer, when at last,—her hand tight
                        clasped in his, they sat together, day by day, and spoke of the long life of
                        joy, which was so shortly to commence for them, in each other’s society.</p>
                    <p>Millicent believed she had found the spirit’s rest at last, the satisfaction,
                        complete and full, of the mysterious longing of her whole being.</p>
                    <p>She still was convinced that none could<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7184-291"/>
                        find it elsewhere than in human love, but she thought, judging from her
                        bitter experience, that all played not well or wisely, their parts in the
                        difficult game of life, and so lost their chance of the one sole means of
                        happiness, which existed for man in affection felt and answered. Therefore
                        still holding this mistaken creed, Millicent did but rejoice the more
                        ardently, that after many struggles, the prize was hers—that she had not,
                        like so many, drawn a blank in that great lottery.</p>
                    <p>If anything even for a moment disturbed her perfect happiness, it was the
                        frequent apparition at the window of the room in which they usually sat, of
                        a haggard, fearful face—that with the tangled hair hanging over a brow dark
                        with despair, and a look of indescribable anguish in the wild, sorrow
                        haunted eyes, cast in upon them a glance of utter wretchedness, that might
                        have touched the coldest spirit.</p>
                    <pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7184-292"/>
                    <p>But happiness is a selfish thing; in sadness mostly we have compassion on the
                        kindred suffering, and we cannot bear to see the tears of others, when our
                        own are falling, because we know their bitterness. In the time of her own
                        great desolation, Millicent had mourned for Arthur Egerton; but now in her
                        absorbing joy, it is doubtful if ever she remembered what he must be
                        suffering, except when that face of agony passed like a frightful vision
                        before her eyes.</p>
                    <p>This indifference on her part served but to exasperate the unhappy man. He
                        knew all that had passed; he saw them, day after day, before him, for he was
                        drawn to that sight which pierced his very soul, by some irresistible
                        attraction. He saw them in their perfect happiness, and truly all hope for
                        him seemed utterly destroyed; nor was he otherwise than inconceivably
                        wretched, but still, not yet had there passed from his soul the strange,
                        mysterious conviction, which<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7184-293"/> had haunted
                        him, ever since Aylmer first came, and stood between him and Millicent,—the
                        deep certainty, that in some way it would be given to him, to tear her out
                        of his arms, even at the very last! And this he still believed. He knew not
                        how it was to be; he had formed no plan, no cruel or wicked intention
                        respecting them. Most utterly as his apostate soul was prostrate in idolatry
                        before her, never yet had its degenerate condition prompted him to crime;
                        but like all men who turn a deaf ear to the voice of truth, he was a
                        fatalist, and what he imagined was written in the decrees of
                        destiny,—destiny, he felt sure, would accomplish. This idea supported and
                        sustained him—in it he lived, or the sight of their happiness must have
                        driven him to insanity; and they knew not that he tracked their steps
                        wherever they went; for Aylmer was now able, led by Millicent, to walk out
                        daily into the woods, and breathe again the sweet breath<pb n="293"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-294"/> of nature. They knew it not, or they must have
                        pitied the maddening envy with which he watched the blind man lean so
                        tenderly upon the dear hand, whose happiest task it was to smooth life’s
                        path for him; and saw the sweet eyes, which Aylmer called his light of day,
                        for truly they gave sight to him, by their unceasing watchfulness, ever
                        turning to him as the sunflower to the sun.</p>
                    <p>“And do you really mean you are going to leave me one whole hour?” said
                        Aylmer fondly, as Millicent sat by him on a bright summer morning.</p>
                    <p>“I really am; but I shall go so quickly, and return so soon, you scarce will
                        miss me.”</p>
                    <p>“Not miss you! even for a single instant, darling? You would miss the light
                        if it were taken from you but one moment, and so you are my light, and I
                        cannot bear that you should go from me, any more than you could bear an
                        utter darkness.”</p>
                    <pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7184-295"/>
                    <p>It made her heart beat thick and faint with joy to hear such words.</p>
                    <p>“Indeed, it is bitter to me to go even for one little hour, but I must do it,
                        it would not be right to neglect the poor creature who is waiting for
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>“I do not see why you should be kind to any one but me,” said Aylmer,
                        playfully. “You are mine, my own most treasured possession, and I will have
                        it, that it is your highest duty to stay with me.”</p>
                    <p>“And so it is my high and happy duty,” said Millicent. “Do you know, I do not
                        think, that above three times in my life, it could be my duty to leave you;
                        and so this is the first time, and I hope the other two will not occur for
                        twenty years to come.”</p>
                    <p>“Could you not put this one off for ten, or even five?—five years hence I
                        will let you leave me two whole hours instead of one; come, is it a
                        bargain?”</p>
                    <p>“But you forget, that if I agreed to that,<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7184-296"/>
                        the bed‐ridden old woman to whom I am going, must wait five years to know
                        whether her son is alive or dead, who fell from a ladder in the village next
                        hers; and now I am to tell her to‐day that he lives, and to make her happy,
                        dear Stephen. <emph>We</emph> know what it is to fear for those we love, so
                        most of all we should show compassion.”</p>
                    <p>“You shall go,” said Aylmer, touched by these words; “and which road do you
                        take?”</p>
                    <p>“The path by the cliff, where we walk every day.”</p>
                    <p>“I know that road so well, I am sure I could find my way alone, so if you do
                        not return in an hour, I shall certainly come to meet you.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, do not attempt that!” exclaimed Millicent, anxiously; “there is a part
                        of the road which is extremely dangerous; it leads along the very edge of
                        the precipice.”</p>
                    <pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7184-297"/>
                    <p>“Ah, that is where I feel your hand clasp mine so tightly, and you guide me
                        with such care. I am sure that pleasant recollection will make me know the
                        spot, and then I can walk cautiously.”</p>
                    <p>“No, dearest Stephen, pray do not try it alone; indeed, I should be in terror
                        if I thought you would; a false turn just there would be destruction.
                        Promise me you will not go.”</p>
                    <p>“Indeed, I shall promise nothing of the kind,” said Aylmer, laughing, “for if
                        you are afraid, it will make you come back to me all the sooner.”</p>
                    <p>“That it will, most certainly,” said Millicent. She kissed his hand as she
                        spoke, in token of farewell, and so they parted.</p>
                    <p>On that path, their accustomed walk, where day by day, Arthur Egerton waited
                        and watched for hours, that he might look on <emph>her</emph> face as she
                        passed him, he now lay hidden expecting the coming of Millicent Grey.</p>
                    <pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7184-298"/>
                    <p>And his patient, miserable watching was soon rewarded; he saw her approaching
                        earlier to‐day than usual, and alone. She came springing up the mountain
                        path, with the dancing step that told what a light, joyous heart she
                        carried,—glad and bright was her face as the morning itself,—sparkling in
                        her eyes was the sunshine of hope, as the beams that lay fair on the rugged
                        hills,—wild and gay as the song of the woodland bird, her sweet voice
                        carolled in the clear, blue air,—a very vision of gladness and joy she
                        seemed, bright in her youth and happiness, as when first he saw her in the
                        old halls at Rookcliffe, and felt that his soul was hers with a surpassing
                        love.</p>
                    <p>Surely the worm that crawls the earth, is not so abject as man, in the
                        egotism of absorbing passion? She was his fellow creature, inheritor with
                        himself of the common death, condemned, like him, to a life<pb n="298"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-299"/> so full of sorrow, and in joy so
                        rare,—susceptible to the misery he now was enduring, whose anguish he knew
                        so well,—and yet, rather would he have seen her as she had been heretofore,
                        wasted and wan, and bowed to the earth, loaded with that burden too heavy to
                        bear,—an affection unsought and unshared,—as now in her gladness and peace;
                        triumphant, with the cup of life’s happiness full to the brim.</p>
                    <p>Onward she came, with the sweet voice singing, and back he shrank from her
                        bright approach as the serpent from the light of day; he cowered among the
                        bushes unseen, till the light form went by, and then the parting branches
                        showed the dark, haggard face gazing after her with baneful glance. She had
                        paused on the dangerous spot of which she had spoken to Aylmer, where the
                        path edged off from the precipice and took an abrupt turn to the abyss, and
                        her thoughts flew swiftly to him who lay<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7184-300"/>
                        dreaming of her even then, and back she looked, with her eyes of love, to
                        the châlet whose very walls were dear for his sake. Arthur caught the
                        glance, and shrunk closer down to the ground where he grovelled, whilst she
                        went on with a swifter step, and her echoing song floating far on the
                        wind.</p>
                    <p>Long hours he lay there, for despair has no time or space, and his soul was
                        stretched on the rack of thought.</p>
                    <p>At length, on that mountain path, another step came sounding near, toiling
                        up, slow, heavy, and feeble, where she had past with her bounding
                        feet,—wearily straining his new‐found strength, the blind man came,
                        cautiously trying his uncertain powers.</p>
                    <p>Arthur Egerton shrunk not from him, as he had shrunk from the sweet face
                        Millicent,—a sudden impulse constrained him to rise, to stand forth and
                        confront this blinded cripple, who had stolen his light of life from
                        him.</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7184-301"/>
                    <p>Aylmer heard the sound of the moving feet, and guiding his steps by the stick
                        on which he leant, drew near.</p>
                    <p>“Who is there?” he said.</p>
                    <p>“Arthur Egerton!”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, is it you? I am glad I have met you. Did you see my Millicent pass this
                        way?”</p>
                    <p>“I saw Millicent Grey go past.”</p>
                    <p>“Then I shall meet her returning soon.”</p>
                    <p>“Then I shall see you come back together.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, together!—as we shall soon be for life; but tell me, am I taking the
                        right direction? The path turns here to escape the precipice, it leads this
                        way, does it not?”</p>
                    <p>He advanced a few steps, and paused for an answer.</p>
                    <p>A bitter laugh rose to the lips of Arthur; the blind man was within one yard
                        of the precipice—he had missed the turning, and one step more would carry
                        him over an<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7184-302"/> abyss some hundred feet deep.
                        Arthur Egerton stood and looked at him, waiting there so unconsciously on
                        the brink of destruction. He had no thought of murder in his mind, though he
                        hated that blind man with an intense hate, but there was a very whirlwind of
                        passion raging through him; fierce and strong did the tide of exultation
                        sweep over his soul, as he thought how, at one word of his, this man,
                        possessor of all he most coveted on earth,—this man, but now triumphing over
                        him in the calm of his happiness, assured in her love,—this man, the bane,
                        the curse of his life,—would even now go crashing down this fearful abyss,
                        to a death most frightful; yes, one word—one word—and the fond eyes of
                        Millicent Grey would seek him in vain on the face of the earth! One word—one
                        word—and never more living love should stand between her and himself! Yet he
                        thought not of saying it; de‐<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7184-303"/> graded as he
                        was, his heart would have shrunk from so tremendous a crime with horror and
                        fear; only he loved to gloat, with the fiercest delight, on the feeling that
                        Stephen Aylmer was now in his power—that revenge, consummate and full, and
                        the desire of his soul, in the death of that man, were before him. He
                        prolonged the time, that he might taste this unholy ecstasy—but the voice of
                        Aylmer sounded again, more impatiently,</p>
                    <p>“Tell me, am I not right?”</p>
                    <p><emph>Now</emph> was the moment when, with one breath from his lips, he might
                        have accomplished all his spirit, long hungering and thirsting, required.
                        Oh, ruin! to relinquish the power,— his own but for one brief instant! Oh,
                        horror to use it!—horror impossible to contemplate!</p>
                    <p>The blood rushed to his head, his temples throbbed furiously, every pulse in
                        his body beat madly—the hands were convul‐<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7184-304"/>
                        sively clasped—the lips opened gaspingly‐forth came the sound of his answer
                            “<emph rend="sc">YES</emph>!”</p>
                    <p>“Yes!” not <emph>his</emph> the voice that uttered that word most fatal, he
                        swore it to his dying day; not his, but some demon who spoke it through his
                        own cursed lips. He had not meant it—he had not thought it—he would have
                        given his soul to recall it ere well it was past; but the word had gone
                        forth with a human life freighted. On that breath, from his mouth, an
                        existence hung, and for the soul of a man, that breath contained the
                        thunders of eternity. It past his lips, it went forth with its mission,
                        blind agent he was, of a supreme decree—not the less an agent in guilt. The
                        word was spoken—the step was taken—down, down, crushing down, through the
                        dark abyss, Stephen Aylmer plunged on to his death.</p>
                    <p>Whirling down through the deep blue air, caught for a moment by the jagged<pb
                            n="304" xml:id="VAB7184-305"/> rocks, flung back by them to the stones
                        that waited below; revolving in a thick cloud of dust, bearing with it the
                        fragments rocks and trees, swifter than the eye could follow, ere the living
                        heart could have beat a few times, the body lay mangled—soulless—<emph
                            rend="sc">DEAD</emph>, struck down in a shattered heap at the foot of
                        that great ravine.</p>
                    <p>For Stephen Aylmer this world was nought—for Stephen Aylmer this life was
                        done. The trial was over, the doom was sealed—the soul was gone, to the Far
                        Unseen.</p>
                    <p>And gay on the mountain air, was the sound of the sweet voice singing, as
                        down through the pine‐wood she sped to that path, and thought on the arms
                        that would open to greet her.</p>
                    <p><emph>He</emph> heard it—he heard that voice—the unwilling murderer, as with
                        ghastly face he peered over that dread abyss, which seemed to him filled
                        with an ocean of blood, whose waves were swelling up to engulf him.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7184-306"/>
                    <p>At the sound of the sweet voice singing, he fled.—Heaven save us from that
                        man’s agony! The demon went with him who had uttered the word, the taunting,
                        laughing, exulting demon! And another went with him,—a spectre, the great
                        gaunt spectre Remorse, who twined her hideous arms around him and clasped
                        him close to her breast as a loving bride—for now she was his wedded
                        companion for life.</p>
                    <p>Then through the chaos of horror that raged in his breast, certain
                        words,—certain words heard in childhood, came with a deepening agony, and
                        seemed to inscribe themselves in letters of burning fire on his soul—they
                        were these:—<quote>

                    <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                    <p><hi>AND</hi> it befell Arthur Egerton, as many a condemned man on the
                        scaffold might attest it befalls most criminals,—he who had lived all his
                        life in practical, if not in intellectual, unbelief, now that the
                        consciousness of a deadly crime was on his soul, became possessed of a full,
                        perfect, and for him, most appalling faith, in the revelation of a future
                        judgment and an eternal punishment. Deep penitence came in like a flood upon
                        his soul—penitence not only for the crime, but for<pb n="307"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-308"/> the idolatrous, unrestrained love which had
                        prompted it.</p>
                    <p>One thought, one wish, one dream was present with him night and day. To be
                        forgiven, by years of a life of penance; to show repentance, and to be
                        forgiven; but he felt that he dared not ask, nor pray, nor so much as
                        breathe the faintest desire for the pardon of heaven, till he had obtained
                        that of her, whom on earth he had so deeply, fatally injured.</p>
                    <p>He knew nothing of her, excepting only that she had not died, when the link
                        that bound her to earth had been so rudely snapped asunder; he knew not how
                        it had fared with her, since she took her last look of the mangled form, she
                        would have cherished with her heart’s life.</p>
                    <p>He knew that the lifeless body of Stephen Aylmer had been found, and carried
                        home the same day that he met his cruel death, and that shortly after it had
                        been conveyed<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7184-309"/> for interment to a
                        burial‐place adjoining a church on the mountain; but never once, from that
                        hour to this, had his eyes looked on the face, or his ears heard the voice
                        of sweet Millicent Grey.</p>
                    <p>Yet henceforward, for him, all existence was gathered up into two great
                        works, which living he must accomplish:—first, to obtain mercy and pardon
                        from her—and then to seek the mercy and pardon of heaven.</p>
                    <p>So, night and day, he wandered round the châlet, wearing the rocks with
                        kneeling close to it, for hours together, still ever hoping—hoping—he might
                        but see her come, where he could lay himself at her feet, and bid her
                        trample on him, if she would. And months passed on, but he had patience, for
                        he lived but in this thought; and so at last, the longing, wasting desire,
                        was accomplished.</p>
                    <p>It was a fair summer morning, glorious and bright, just such a day, as that
                        on which<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7184-310"/> she went forth in her gladness,
                        with the sweet voice carolling, and light step dancing, to meet her final
                        despair.</p>
                    <p>The murderer, with the spectre Remorse, to whom he was wedded, at his side,
                        knelt on the rock, whence he could see her dwelling;—when it was given him
                        to look upon her once again. Across that threshold, with a calm, gliding
                        step, there passed what seemed to him more like a spirit than a human
                        being—so wan, so wasted. Surely death had passed already on that bloodless
                        cheek, that pure, transparent forehead.</p>
                    <p>Surely no inhabitant of earth ever looked to heaven with eyes so spiritual,
                        so holy, glittering with pure light, like the stars in the sky. What a
                        stormless serenity on that face, pallid and delicate as monumental marble!
                        What an imploring expression of meekness in the white, half‐parted lips!
                        What a depth of utter submission in the folding of those pale hands on the
                        still fair<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7184-311"/> bosom; but so fragile, so
                        unlike a living being, moving with the light wind, like the slender form of
                        a white and stainless lily, gliding along without a movement of those quiet
                        hands, or a change of expression in the serene, pale countenance. It was
                        thus, as with spirit‐feet, that she passed him, and he arose and followed
                        after her.</p>
                    <p>Rocking to and fro with every breath of wind, while gently waved the white
                        robes around her, the tranquil figure glided on: in the golden sunshine, in
                        the warm, glowing hues of day, she looked like a pale sheeted ghost,
                        flitting back with its noiseless step to the rest of its own quiet
                        grave.</p>
                    <p>And to a grave she went,—in one sense her own, for her heart lay buried
                        there. They had made the couch of his deep repose beneath a tall pine‐tree,
                        a sweet, fair spot, for the long grass waved there and the flowers were
                        growing, and none need have dreamt of the worms beneath;<pb n="311"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-312"/> and she passed on, so light the form, her feet
                        left no mark on the turf,—and by the side of that grave she knelt down. Then
                        she folded the meek hands prayerfully, and upward fixed those pure, holy
                        eyes, with a rapt and intense contemplation, as though the glory of the
                        skies were drawing her soul through them to heaven. Her lips moved not, and
                        no sound was uttered,—she might have been what she most resembled, a statue
                        of snow‐white stone.</p>
                    <p>Creeping on to her, cowering earthwards, like a dark, blighting shadow, came
                        the penitent man; nearer and nearer he stole, trembling and gasping, fearing
                        almost he should see her pass away like a vision, too fair and too
                        angel‐like for this cold cruel world.</p>
                    <p>But still she remained, so calm and so motionless: the fair lids drooped not
                        over the deep, longing gaze, and her quiet breath stirred not the soft
                        summer air. Then he<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7184-313"/> came and laid him down
                        in the dust beside her.</p>
                    <p>He told her all,—all his terrible tale, and confessed that from him had the
                        word gone forth, which consigned the being she had loved so well to his
                        death of anguish, and herself to despair. He writhed on the ground as he
                        spoke, for it seemed to him superhuman that she should think of forgiveness
                        now,—yet he asked it, as the frantic man, dying of thirst, asks the draught
                        of pure water that alone can save him. He had not looked on her face, so he
                        knew not how she had borne these tidings, and her sweet voice had breathed
                        no sound while he spoke; but when he asked for pardon her answer came
                        slowly. She rose from her knees and stood upright, softly she laid the fair,
                        transparent hand on the dust‐soiled head of the penitent man,—clear and
                        sweet as the loveliest music, her voice breathed out on the summer air:—</p>
                    <pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7184-314"/>
                    <p>“I forgive you deeply and fully, as I pray that I may be forgiven.”</p>
                    <p>The hands rested there a moment as if with a silent blessing, then, like the
                        white wings of a dove, from his head were lifted and folded meekly across
                        her own calm breast.</p>
                    <p>She resumed her place on the quiet grave, and he felt as though waters most
                        pure and refreshing had passed on his guilty soul; but he dared not linger
                        near her, lest a feeling of joy should steal into his heart. No right had he
                        to know aught on this earth save that one word <emph>repentance</emph>, yet
                        his heart groaned to know that she was, indeed, comforted,—his gentle,
                        beloved victim. Faintly he whispered,—</p>
                    <p>“Are you, indeed, at rest?” and she answered,</p>
                    <p>“I rest, as I never rested on earth before:—hear me, and learn life’s truth
                        from my lips,—if sorrow hath not taught you already. I thought that the
                        soul’s repose was in human love, and thus far I was right, that in Love<pb
                            n="314" xml:id="VAB7184-315"/> alone the immortal spirit can live, but
                        the human love is only the type of that which can never die. For the
                        glorious substance I mistook the faint shadow, and therefore I erred and
                        suffered. Then in mercy, to the sweet earthly love bright wings were given,
                        that bore it away from my breast to heaven, and my soul following after it,
                        upward stole, to find <emph>there</emph> the True Love that faileth never. I
                        found it, and now I rest in a rest undying,—so may you find it, and so
                        repose.”</p>
                    <p>The low voice died away on his ear like the sigh of the summer wind when
                        night closes in. He heard the light feet echo past, and the waving of her
                        garments as she glided away, but he dared not look up, he was spell‐bound
                        there.</p>
                    <p>So never more did he look on her face, or hear her sweet voice again.</p>
                    <p>Arthur Egerton went out from the shores of Europe, to the burning regions of
                            tropical<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7184-316"/> lands; he joined himself to a
                        company of men, strong in purpose and stout of heart, who had devoted
                        themselves to the good of their fellow‐creatures. They had made an offering
                        of their lives for the one great purpose of raising a brute people from
                        their deep degradation,—a nation who lived like wild beasts of prey,—whose
                        existence was but vitality,—whose spirits were steeped in a moral death.</p>
                    <p>The life of their benefactors among them was full of torment, and danger, and
                        toil; but none so toiled in torture and pain, as the remorseful man that
                        went with them. He willed to be the slave of all,—he chose the heaviest
                        burdens,—the hardest task; no complaint passed his lips, no rest did he
                        seek:—to a practical repentance he vowed his life, and well hath he kept
                        that vow.</p>
                    <p> * * * *</p>
                    <p>Long years had past, when in the twilight sky, one summer’s evening, a
                        sunbeam lingered. It was the last sweet smile of the<pb n="316"
                            xml:id="VAB7184-317"/> dying day, a soft ray of golden light, and it
                        followed not the sun when he sunk to rest, as though it yet had a mission on
                        earth. Down from the darkening heaven it stole, and sped over forest and
                        plain,—it did but tinge them with its pale pure light, for it rested not
                        till its task was done, and onward passed to the appointed place. To a vast
                        noble city it swiftly came,—along crowded districts and narrow streets it
                        carried its gentle radiance, till through the latticed window of a lowly
                        house it passed into a still dark room.</p>
                    <p>That house was known to all who suffered near,—refuge for the orphan,—home
                        for the penitent,—dwelling for the blind, the infirm, and aged; no sorrow
                        that touches the human heart, could fail to find sympathy there.</p>
                    <p>And the sunbeam entered the quiet room, for here must its work be done,—and
                        it settled in glory on the pure pale brow of one who lay there most placid
                        and calm.</p>
                    <pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7184-318"/>
                    <p>That beam might have travelled the wide world over, and failed to meet a
                        sight more holy and bright, than that which it lit with its glory now.</p>
                    <p>For the countenance where it shone in its golden light, wore that aspect of
                        loveliness most serene, which never on earth can be found, save only on the
                        face of the holy dead.</p>
                    <p>Oh the unutterable beauty of gentle sleep, with which the white lids rested
                        on the whiter cheek! oh, smile of ineffable joy that lingered on the pale
                        sweet mouth! How the aching heart, throbbing so thick and fast, faints with
                        desire to know that rest!</p>
                    <p>Fit mission for the last bright sunbeam, to lend its radiance to that fair
                        corpse, for the night shall be short for both, and a glorious morning shall
                        wake for them.</p>
                    <p>Those who had known her past history, had placed in her dead hands the types
                            of<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7184-319"/> her life. In one, they had laid a
                        few flowers of earth, for in those she had trusted in her morning of days;
                        now the white fingers held them not, and they had withered away as they
                        rested there. But the other hand, still in a tight fond grasp, remained
                        closed round the holy symbol of her faith which she had pressed to her dying
                        heart; and there it yet lay on that placid breast, earnest and pledge of the
                        rest, her spirit had found at last.</p>
