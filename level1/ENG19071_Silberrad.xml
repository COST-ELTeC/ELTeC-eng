    <head>THE POLKINGTONS</head>
    <p>The Polkingtons were of those people who do not dine. They lunched, though few besides Johnny
     Gillat, who did not count, had been invited to share that meal with them. They took tea, the
     daintiest, pleasantest, most charming of teas, as the <hi>élite</hi> of Marbridge knew;
     everybody—or, rather, a selection of everybody, had had tea with them one time or another.
     After that there was no record; the <hi>élite</hi>, who would as soon have thought of going
     without their heads as without their dinner, concluded they dined, because they were "one of
     us." But some humbler folk were of opinion that they only dined once a week, and that after
     morning service on Sundays; but even this idea was dispelled when the eldest Miss Polkington
     was heard to excuse her non-appearance at an organ recital because "lunch was always so late on
     Sunday."</p>
    <p>Let it not be imagined from this that the Polkingtons were common people—they were not; they
     were extremely well connected; indeed, their connections were one of the two striking features
     about them, the other was their handicap, Captain Polkington, late of the ——th Bengal Lancers.
     He was well connected, though not quite so much so as his wife; still—well, but he was not
     <pb n="2"/> very presentable. If only he had been dead he would have been a valuable asset, but
     living, he was decidedly rather a drawback; there are some relatives like this. Mrs. Polkington
     bore up under it valiantly; in fact, they all did so well that in time they, or at least she
     and two of her three daughters, came almost to believe some of the legends they told of the
     Captain.</p>
    <p>The Polkingtons lived at No. 27 East Street, which, as all who know Marbridge are aware, is a
     very good street in which to live. The house was rather small, but the drawing-room was good,
     with two beautiful Queen Anne windows, and a white door with six panels. The rest of the house
     did not matter. On the whole the drawing-room did not so very much matter, because visitors
     seldom went into it when the Miss Polkingtons were not there; and when they were, no one but a
     jealous woman would have noticed that the furniture was rather slight, and there were no
     flowers except those in obvious places.</p>
    <p>There was only one Miss Polkington in the drawing-room that wintry afternoon—Julia, the
     middle one of the three, the only one who could not fill even a larger room to the complete
     obliteration of furniture and fitments. Julia was not pretty, therefore she was seldom to be
     found in the drawing-room alone; she knew better than to attempt to occupy that stage by
     herself. But it was now almost seven o'clock, too late for any one to come; also, since there
     was no light but the fire, deficiencies were not noticeable. She felt secure of interruption,
     and stood with one foot on the fender, looking earnestly into the fire.</p>
    <p>That day had been an important one to the Polkingtons; Violet, the eldest of the sisters, had
     that afternoon accepted an offer of marriage from the Reverend Richard
     <pb n="3"/> Frazer. The young man had not left the house an hour, and Mrs. Polkington was not
     yet returned from some afternoon engagement more than half, but already the matter had been in
     part discussed by the family. Julia, standing by the drawing-room fire, was in a position to
     review at least some points of the case dispassionately. Violet was two and twenty, tall, and
     of a fine presence, like her mother, but handsomer than the elder woman could ever have been.
     She had undoubted abilities, principally of a social order, but not a penny apiece to her
     dower. She had this afternoon accepted Richard Frazer, though he was only a curate—an
     aristocratic one certainly, with a small private income, and an uncle lately made bishop of one
     of the minor sees. Violet was fond of him; she was too nice a girl to accept a man she was not
     fond of, though too well brought up to become fond of one who was impossible. The engagement,
     though it probably did not fulfil all Mrs. Polkington's ambitions, was in Julia's opinion a
     good thing for several reasons.</p>
    <p>There was a swish and rustle of silk by the door—Mrs. Polkington did not wear silk skirts,
     only a silk flounce somewhere, but she got more creak and rustle out of it than the average
     woman does out of two skirts. An imposing woman she was, with an eye that had once been
     described as "eagle," though, for that, it was a little inquiring and eager now, by reason of
     the look-out she had been obliged to keep for a good part of her life. She entered the room
     now, followed by her eldest and youngest daughters, Violet and Chèrie.</p>
    <p>"At twelve to-morrow?" she was saying as she came in. "Is that when he is coming to see your
     father?"</p>
    <p>Violet said it was; then added, in a tone of some dissatisfaction, "I suppose he must see
     father about it? We couldn't arrange something?"
     <pb n="4"/></p>
    <p>"Certainly not," Mrs. Polkington replied with decision; "it is not for me to give or refuse
     consent to your marriage. Of course, Mr. Frazer knows your father does not have good health, or
     trouble himself to mix much in society here—it is not likely that an old military man should,
     but in a case like this he would expect to be called upon; it would have shown a great lack of
     breeding on Mr. Frazer's part had he suggested anything different."</p>
    <p>Violet agreed, though she did not seem exactly convinced, and Julia created a diversion by
     saying—</p>
    <p>"Twelve is rather an awkward time. A quarter of an hour with father, five minutes—no,
     ten—with you, half an hour with Violet, altogether brings it very near lunch time."</p>
    <p>"Mr. Frazer will, of course, lunch with us to-morrow," Mrs. Polkington said, as if stray
     guests to lunch were the most usual and convenient thing in the world. The Polkingtons kept up
     a good many of their farces in private life; most of them found it easier, as well as
     pleasanter, to do so. "The cold beef," Mrs. Polkington said, mentally reviewing her larder,
     "can be hashed; that and a small boned loin of mutton will do, he would naturally expect to be
     treated as one of the family; fortunately the apple tart has not been cut—with a little
     cream—"</p>
    <p>"I thought we were to have the tart to-night," Julia interrupted, thinking of Johnny Gillat,
     who was coming to spend the evening with her father.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington thought of him too, but she did not change her mind on this account. "We
     can't, then," she said, and turned to the discussion of other matters. She had carried these as
     far as the probable date of marriage, and the preferment the young man might easily expect,
     when the little servant came up to announce Mr. Gillat.
     <pb n="5"/></p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington did not express impatience. "Is he in the dining-room?" she said. "I hope you
     lighted the heater, Mary."</p>
    <p>Mary said she had, and Mrs. Polkington returned to her interesting subject, only pausing to
     remark, "How tiresome that your father is not back yet!"</p>
    <p>For a little none of the three girls moved, then Julia rose.</p>
    <p>"Are you going down to Mr. Gillat?" her mother asked. "There really is no necessity; he is
     perfectly happy with the paper."</p>
    <p>Perhaps he was, though the paper was a half-penny morning one; he did not make extravagant
     demands on fate, or anything else; nevertheless, Julia went down.</p>
    <p>The Polkingtons' house was furnished on an ascending scale, which found its zenith in the
     drawing-room, but deteriorated again very rapidly afterwards. The dining-room, being midway
     between the kitchen and the drawing-room, was only a middling-looking apartment. They did not
     often have a fire there; a paraffin lamp stove stood in the fire-place, leering with its red
     eye as if it took a wicked satisfaction in its own smell. Before the fire-place, re-reading the
     already-known newspaper by the light of one gas jet, sat Johnny Gillat. Poor old Johnny, with
     his round, pink face, whereon a grizzled little moustache looked as much out of place as on a
     twelve-year-old school-boy. There was something of the school-boy in his look and in his
     deprecating manner, especially to Mrs. Polkington; he had always been a little deprecating to
     her even when he had first known her, a bride, while he himself was the wealthy bachelor friend
     of her husband. He was still a bachelor, and still her husband's friend, but the wealth had
     gone long ago. He had now only just enough to keep him, fortunately so secured that he could
     <pb n="6"/> not touch the principal. It was a mercy he had it, for there was no known work at
     which he could have earned sixpence, unless perhaps it was road scraping under a not too
     exacting District Council. He was a harmless enough person, but when he took it into his head
     to leave his lodgings in town for others, equally cheap and nasty, at Marbridge, Mrs.
     Polkington felt fate was hard upon her. It was like having two Captain Polkingtons, of a
     different sort, but equally unsuitable for public use, in the place. In self defence she had
     been obliged to make definite rules for Mr. Gillat's coming and going about the house, and
     still more definite rules as to the rooms in which he might be found. The dining-room was
     allowed him, and there he was when Julia came.</p>
    <p>He looked up as she entered, and smiled; he regarded her as almost as much his friend as her
     father; a composite creature, and a necessary connection between the superior and inferior
     halves of the household.</p>
    <p>"Father not in, I hear," he said.</p>
    <p>"No," Julia answered. "What a smell there is!"</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat allowed it. "There's something gone wrong with Bouquet," he said, thoughtfully
     regarding the stove.</p>
    <p>The "Bouquet Heater" was the name under which it was patented; it did not seem quite honest
     to speak of it as a heater, so perhaps "Bouquet" was the better name.</p>
    <p>Julia went to it. "I should think there is," she said, and turned it up, and turn it down,
     and altered the wicks, until she had improved matters a little.</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid your father's having larks," Johnny said, watching her.</p>
    <p>"It's rather a pity if he is," Julia answered; "he has got to see some one on business
     to-morrow."</p>
    <p>"Who?"</p>
    <p>"Mr. Frazer, a clergyman who wants to marry Violet."
     <pb n="7"/></p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat sat upright. "Dear, dear!" he exclaimed. "No? Really?" and when Julia had given
     him an outline of the circumstances, he added softly, "A wonderful woman! I always had a great
     respect for your mother." From which it is clear he thought Mrs. Polkington was to be
     congratulated. "And when is it to be?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Violet says a year's time; they could not afford to marry sooner and do it properly, but it
     will have to be sooner all the same."</p>
    <p>"A year is not a very long time," Mr. Gillat observed; "they go fast, years; one almost loses
     count of them, they go so fast."</p>
    <p>"I dare say," Julia answered, "but Violet will have to get married without waiting for the
     year to pass. We can't afford a long engagement."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat looked mildly surprised and troubled; he always did when scarcity of money was
     brought home to him, but Julia regarded it quite calmly.</p>
    <p>"The sooner Violet is married," she said, "the sooner we can reduce some of the expenses; we
     are living beyond our income now—not a great deal, perhaps, still a bit; Violet's going would
     save enough, I believe; we could catch up then. That is one reason, but the chief is that a
     long engagement is expensive; you see, we should have to have meals different, and fires
     different, and all manner of extras if Mr. Frazer came in and out constantly. We should have to
     live altogether in a more expensive style; we might manage it for three months, or six if we
     were driven to it, but for a year—it is out of the question."</p>
    <p>"But," Mr. Gillat protested, "if they can't afford it? You said he could not; he is a
     curate."</p>
    <p>"He must get a living, or a chaplaincy, or something;
     <pb n="8"/>or rather, I expect we must get it for him. Oh, no, we have no Church influence, and
     we don't know any bishops; but one can always rake up influence, and get to know people, if one
     is not too particular how."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat looked at her uneasily; every now and then there flitted through his mind a
     suspicion that Julia was clever too, as clever perhaps as her mother, and though not, like her,
     a moral and social pillar standing in the high first estate from which he and the Captain had
     fallen. Julia had never been that, never aspired to it; she was no success at all; content to
     come and sit in the dining-room with him and Bouquet; she could not really be clever, or else
     she would have achieved something for herself, and scorned to consort with failures. He smiled
     benignly as he remembered this, observing, "I dare say something will be done—I hope it may;
     your mother's a wonderful woman, a wonderful—"</p>
    <p>He broke off to listen; Julia listened too, then she rose to her feet. "That's father," she
     said, and went to let him in.</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat followed her to the door. "Ah—h'm," he said, as he saw the Captain coming in
     slowly, with a face of despairing melancholy and a drooping step.</p>
    <p>"Come down-stairs, father," Julia said. "Come along, Johnny."</p>
    <p>They followed her meekly to the basement, where there was a gloomy little room behind the
     kitchen reserved for the Captain's special use. A paraffin stove stood in the fire-place also,
     own brother to the one in the dining-room; Julia stooped to light it, while her father sank
     into a chair.</p>
    <p>"Gillat," he said in a voice of hopelessness, "I am a ruined man."</p>
    <p>"No?" Mr. Gillat answered sympathetically, but without surprise. "Dear me!" He carefully put
     down the
     <pb n="9"/> hat and stick he had brought with him, the one on the edge of the table, the other
     against it, both so badly balanced that they fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>"You shouldn't do it, you know," he said, with mild reproof; "you really shouldn't."</p>
    <p>"Do it!" the Captain cried. "Do what?"</p>
    <p>Julia looked up from the floor where she knelt trimming the stove-lamp. "Have five whiskeys
     and sodas," she said, examining her father judicially.</p>
    <p>He did not deny the charge; Julia's observation was not to be avoided.</p>
    <p>"And what is five?" he demanded with dignity.</p>
    <p>"Three too many for you," she answered.</p>
    <p>"Do you mean to insinuate that I am intoxicated?" he asked. "Johnny," he turned pathetically
     to his friend, "my own daughter insinuates that I am intoxicated."</p>
    <p>"No," Julia said, "I don't; I say it does not agree with you, and it doesn't—you know you
     ought not to take more than two glasses."</p>
    <p>"Is that your opinion, Gillat?" Captain Polkington asked. "Is that what you meant? That I—I
     should confine myself to two glasses of whiskey and water?"</p>
    <p>"I wasn't thinking of the whiskey," Johnny said apologetically; "it was the gees."</p>
    <p>The Captain groaned, but what he said more Julia did not hear; she went out into the kitchen
     to get paraffin. But she had no doubt that he defended the attacked point to his own
     satisfaction, as he always had done—cards, races, and kindred pleasant, if expensive, things,
     ever since the days long ago before he sent in his papers.</p>
    <p>These same pleasant things had had a good deal to do with the sending in of the papers; not
     that they had led the Captain into anything disgraceful, the compulsion to resign his
     commission came solely from relatives, prin
     <pb n="10"/>cipally those of his wife. It was their opinion that he worked too little and
     played too much, and an expensive kind of play. That he drank too much was not said; of course,
     the Indian climate and life tempted to whiskey pegs, and nature had not fitted him for them in
     large quantities; still that was never cast up against him. Enough was, however, to bring
     things to an end; he resigned, relations helped to pay his debts, and he came home with the
     avowed intention of getting some gentlemanly employment. Of course he never got any, it wasn't
     likely, hardly possible; but he had something left to live upon—a very small private income, a
     clever wife, and some useful and conscientious relations.</p>
    <p>Somehow the family lived, quite how in the early days no one knew; Mrs. Polkington never
     spoke of it at the time, and now, mercifully, she had forgotten part, but the struggle must
     have been bitter. Herself disillusioned, her daughters mere children, her position insecure,
     and her husband not yet reduced to submission, and always prone to slip back into his old ways.
     But she had won through somehow, and time had given her the compensations possible to her
     nature. She was, by her own untiring efforts, a social factor now, even a social success; her
     eldest daughter was engaged to a clergyman of sufficient, if small, means, and her youngest was
     almost a beauty. As to the Captain, he was still there; time had not taken him away, but it had
     reduced him; he gave little trouble now even when Johnny Gillat came; he kept so out of the way
     that she had almost come to regard him as a negligible factor—which was a mistake.</p>
    <p>Both the Captain and his friend had a great respect for Mrs. Polkington, though both felt at
     times that she treated them a little hardly. The Captain especially felt this, but he put up
     with it; after all it is easier to acqui
     <pb n="11"/>esce than to assert one's rights, and, as Johnny pointed out, it was on the whole
     more comfortable, in spite of horse-hair chairs, down in the basement than up in the
     drawing-room. There was no need to make polite conversation down here, and one might smoke, no
     matter how cheap the tobacco, and put one's feet up, and really Bouquet was almost as good as a
     fire when you once get used to it.</p>
    <p>Johnny was of a contented mind, he even looked contented sitting by the empty stove when
     Julia came back with the paraffin; the Captain, on the other hand, appeared to be very gloomy
     and unhappy; he sat silent all the time his daughter was present. As she was leaving the room
     Johnny tried to rouse him. "We might have a game," he suggested, looking towards a pack of
     cards that stuck out of a half-opened drawer.</p>
    <p>"I have nothing in the world that I can call my own," Captain Polkington answered, without
     moving.</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat felt in his own lean pockets surreptitiously. "We might play for paper," he
     said.</p>
    <p>And as she went up-stairs Julia listened to hear their chairs scroop on the kamptulikon floor
     as they drew them to the table; she was surprised not to hear the sound, but she imagined the
     game must have been put off a little so that her father could talk over his troubles. Which,
     indeed, was the case, though the magnitude of those troubles she did not guess.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER II</head>
    <head>THE DEBT</head>
    <p>Violet's engagement was an accepted fact. Mr. Frazer came to see the Captain, who received
     him in the dining-room—the combined ingenuity of the family could not make the down-stairs room
     presentable. The interview was short, but satisfactory; so also was the one with Mrs.
     Polkington which followed; with Violet it was longer, but, no doubt, equally satisfactory.
     Lunch, too, was all that could be desired. Mrs. Polkington's manners were always gracious, and
     to-day she had a charming air of taking Richard into the family—after having shut all the
     doors, actual and metaphorical, which led to anything real and personal. The Captain was rather
     twittery at lunch, at times inclined to talk too much, at times heavily silent and always
     obviously submissive to his wife. Yesterday's excitement was not enough to account for this in
     Julia's opinion. "He has been doing something," she decided, and wondered what.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington and her daughters all went out that afternoon; Julia, however, returned at
     about dusk. As the others had no intention of coming back so soon, there was no drawing-room
     tea; a much simpler meal was spread in the dining-room. Julia and her father had only just sat
     down to it when they heard Johnny Gillat's knock at the front door, followed a minute
     afterwards by Mr. Gillat himself; but when he saw that the Captain was
     <pb n="13"/> not alone, he stopped on the threshold; Julia's presence, contrary to custom,
     seemed to discompose him. He, then, was in her father's secret, whatever it might be; she
     guessed as much when she saw his perturbed pink face. However, she did not say anything, only
     invited Mr. Gillat to have some tea.</p>
    <p>Johnny sat down, and put a small and rather badly tied parcel beside him; next minute he
     picked it up again, and began surreptitiously to put it into first one pocket and then another.
     It was rather a tight fit, and in his efforts to do it unobtrusively, he made some disturbance,
     but no one remarked on it; Captain Polkington because he was too despondent, Julia because it
     did not seem worth while. Conversation languished; Julia did what she could, but her father
     answered in monosyllables, and Mr. Gillat said, "Very true," or "Ah, yes, yes," eating slice
     after slice of thick bread and butter, and filling his mouth very full as if to cork it up and
     so prevent his having to answer awkward questions.</p>
    <p>At last Captain Polkington rose; "Gillat," he said, "if you have finished, we may as well go
     down-stairs."</p>
    <p>Johnny set down his half-finished cup of tea with alacrity, and with alacrity followed the
     Captain. But Julia followed too; Johnny turned uneasily as he heard her step behind him on the
     dark stairs; doubtless, so he told himself, she was going to the kitchen. She was not, however;
     on the contrary, she showed every sign of accompanying them to the little room behind.</p>
    <p>"Do you want anything, Julia?" her father asked, turning about in the doorway; "I'm busy
     to-night—I wish you would go away."</p>
    <p>The sentence began with dignity, but ended with querulousness. But Julia was not affected;
     she came into the
     <pb n="14"/>room. "I want to talk to you," she said, closing the door. "You had much better
     tell me about it, you will be found out, you know; mother would have guessed there was
     something wrong to-day if she had not been so busy with Mr. Frazer."</p>
    <p>"Found out in what?" the Captain demanded; "I should like to know of what you accuse me—you,
     my own daughter—this is much, indeed."</p>
    <p>He paced the hearthrug with outraged dignity, but Julia only drew one of the horse-hair
     chairs to the table. "You would do better to tell me," she said; "I might be able to help
     you—Johnny, won't you sit down?"</p>
    <p>Johnny took the cane deck-chair, sitting down nervously and so near the edge that the old
     chair creaked ominously. Captain Polkington paced the rug once or twice more, then he sat down
     opposite, giving up all pretence of dignity.</p>
    <p>"It is money, of course," Julia went on; "I suppose you lost at the races yesterday—how
     much?"</p>
    <p>The Captain did not answer, he seemed overwhelmed by his troubles. "How much?" Julia
     repeated, turning to Mr. Gillat.</p>
    <p>"It was rather much," that gentleman answered apologetically.</p>
    <p>Julia looked puzzled. "How could he have much to lose?" she asked. "You couldn't, you know,"
     bending her brows as she looked at her father—"unless you borrowed—did you borrow?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes," he said, rather eagerly; "I borrowed—that was it; of course I was going to pay
     back—I am going to pay back."</p>
    <p>"From whom did you borrow?" Another pause, and the question again, then the Captain explained
     confusedly: "The cheque—it came a day early—I merely meant to make use of it for the day—"
     <pb n="15"/></p>
    <p>"The cheque!" Julia repeated, with dawning comprehension. "The cheque from Slade &amp; Slade
     that mother was speaking of this morning. Our cheque, the money we have to live on for the next
     three months?"</p>
    <p>"My cheque," her father said, with one last effort at dignity; "made out to me—my income that
     I have a perfect right to spend as I like; I used my own money for my own purposes."</p>
    <p>He forgot that a moment back he had excused the act as a borrowing; Julia did not remind him,
     she was too much concerned with the facts to trouble about mere turns of speech. They, like
     words and motives, had not heretofore entered much into her considerations; consequences were
     what was really important to her—how the bad might be averted, how the good drawn that way, and
     all used to the best advantage. This point of view, though it leaves a great deal to be
     desired, has one advantage—those who take it waste no time in lamentation or reproof. For that
     reason they are perhaps some of the least unpleasant people to confess to.</p>
    <p>Julia wasted no words now; she sat for a brief minute, stunned by the magnitude of the
     calamity which had deprived them of the largest part of their income for the next three months;
     then she began to look round in her mind to see what might be done. Captain Polkington offered
     a few not very coherent explanations and excuses, to which she did not listen, and then
     relapsed into silence. Johnny sat opposite, rubbing his hands in nervous sympathy, and looking
     from father to daughter; he took the silence of the one to be as hopeless as that of the
     other.</p>
    <p>"We thought," he ventured at last, tugging at the parcel now firmly wedged in his pocket. "We
     hoped, that is, we thought perhaps we might raise a trifle, it wouldn't be much help—"
     <pb n="16"/></p>
    <p>But neither of the others were listening to him, and Captain Polkington interrupted with his
     own remedy, "We shall have to manage on credit," he said; "we can get credit for this three
     months."</p>
    <p>"We can't," Julia assured him; "the greater part of that money was to have paid outstanding
     bills; we can't live on credit, because we haven't got any to live on."</p>
    <p>"That's nonsense," her father said; "it can be done with care and economy, and
     retrenchments."</p>
    <p>Julia did not answer, so Johnny took up the words. "Yes, yes," he said, "one can always
     retrench; it is really marvellous how little one can do with, in fact one is better for it; I
     feel a different man for having to retrench. Your mother's a wonderful woman"—he stopped, then
     added doubtfully as he thought of the lost apple tart—"I suppose, though, she would want to
     make a good appearance just now, with the engagement, Mr. Frazer in and out. It is very
     unfortunate, very."</p>
    <p>By this time he had untied his parcel, and flattening the paper on his knees began to put the
     contents on the table. There were some field-glasses, a breast pin, and a few other such
     things; when he had put them all out he felt in his waistcoat-pocket for his watch.</p>
    <p>"They would fetch a trifle," he said, regarding the row a little proudly.</p>
    <p>"Those?" Julia asked, puzzled.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Mr. Gillat said; "not a great deal, of course, but it would be a help—it might pay the
     butcher's bill. It's a great thing to have the butcher's bill paid; I've heard my landlady say
     so; it gives a standing with the other tradespeople, and that's what you want—she often says
     so."</p>
    <p>"You mean you think of selling them for us?" Julia asked, fixing her keen eyes on Johnny, so
     that he felt
     <pb n="17"/> very guilty, and as if he ought to excuse himself. But before he could do it she
     had swept his belongings together. "You won't do anything of the kind," she said.</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>"Because we won't have it. Pack them up."</p>
    <p>"Oh, but," Johnny protested, "it would be a little help, it would indeed; they would fetch
     something, the glasses are good ones, though a bit old-fashioned, and the watch—"</p>
    <p>"I don't care, I won't have it," and Julia took the matter into her own hands, and began with
     a flushed face to re-pack the things herself.</p>
    <p>"Is it that you think I can't spare them?" Gillat asked, still bewildered. "I can—what an
     idea," he laughed. "What do I want with field-glasses, now? And as to a watch, my time's
     nothing to me!"</p>
    <p>"No, I dare say not," Julia said, but she tied the parcel firmly, then she gave it to him.
     "Take it away," she said, "and don't try to sell a thing."</p>
    <p>She opened the door as she spoke, and he, accepting it as a hint of dismissal, meekly
     followed her from the room. When they had reached the hall above he ventured on a last protest.
     "Why may I not sell anything?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Because we have not quite come to that," she said, with a ring of bitterness in her voice:
     "We have come pretty low, I know, with our dodges and our shifts, but we haven't quite come to
     depriving you. Johnny"—and she stretched out a hand to him, a thing which was rare, for no one
     thought it necessary to shake hands with Mr. Gillat—"it's very good of you to offer; I'm
     grateful to you; I'm awfully glad you did it; you made me ashamed."</p>
    <p>Johnny looked at her perplexed; the note of bitterness
     <pb n="18"/> in her voice had deepened to something more he was altogether at a loss to
     understand. But she gave him no opportunity for inquiry, for she opened the street door.</p>
    <p>"Good-bye," she said, her usual self again, "and don't you let me catch you selling those
     things."</p>
    <p>"Oh, I say! But how will you manage?" he protested.</p>
    <p>"Somehow; I have got several ideas already; I'm better at this sort of game than you are, you
     know."</p>
    <p>And she shut the door upon him; then she went back to Captain Polkington.</p>
    <p>"Father," he said, "would you mind telling me if you have borrowed any other money? It would
     be much simpler if we knew just how we stood."</p>
    <p>The Captain seemed to have a painfully clear idea of how he stood. "Your mother," he
     remarked, with apparent irrelevance, "is such an unreasonable woman; if she were like you—if
     she saw things sensibly. But she won't, she'll make a fuss; she will entirely overlook the fact
     that it is my own money that I have lost."</p>
    <p>"I am afraid she will," Julia agreed. "Will you tell me if you lost any one else's money as
     well?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, a trifle," the Captain said; "nothing to speak of yesterday; I have borrowed a little
     now and again, at cards and so on; a trifling accommodation."</p>
    <p>"From whom?"</p>
    <p>"Rawson-Clew."</p>
    <p>Julia nodded; this was bad, but it might have been worse. Mr. Rawson-Clew was not a personal
     friend of the Polkingtons, and he was not a man in an inferior position who might presume upon
     his loan to the Captain to establish a friendly footing. On the contrary, he was in a superior
     position, so much so that for a moment Julia was at a loss to understand how he came to
     accommodate
     <pb n="19"/>her father. Then she recalled his face—he had been pointed out to her—he looked a
     good-natured fool; probably he had met the Captain somewhere and been sorry for him, or perhaps
     he did not like to say "no." In any case he had lent the money and, so Julia fancied, would
     have to wait a very long time before he saw it again. She dismissed the young man from her mind
     and fell to working out plans to meet the more pressing difficulties.</p>
    <p>The relations would have to help; not with money; they would not do that to a useful extent,
     but with invitations. Chèrie was easily provided for; Aunt Louise had before offered to take
     her abroad for the winter; Chèrie did not in the least want to go; it was likely to be nothing
     nicer than acting as unpaid companion to a fidgety old lady; but under the present
     circumstances she would have to go. For Violet it was not quite so easy; it would look rather
     odd for her to go visiting among obliging relatives, seeing that she was only just engaged—how
     things looked was a point the Polkingtons always considered. But it would have to be managed;
     Julia fancied something might be arranged at Bath, a place which was a cheap fare from
     Marbridge. Mrs. Polkington would probably go somewhere for part of the time, then there could
     be some real retrenchments not otherwise possible. Mary might be dismissed; Mr. Gillat even
     might come to board with them for a little; the outside world need not know he was a guest that
     paid.</p>
    <p>Julia was not satisfied with these plans; they would barely meet the difficulty she knew,
     even with credit stretched to the uttermost and the household crippled for some time; but she
     could think of nothing better, and determined to suggest them to Mrs. Polkington. With these
     thoughts in her mind, she went up-stairs; as she passed the drawing-room, she noticed that the
     blinds had
     <pb n="20"/> not been pulled down; she went to the window to remedy the omission, and so saw in
     the street below the young man who, with the debt owing to him, she had lately dismissed from
     her mind. There was a street lamp directly below the window, and she stood a moment by the
     curtain looking down. Mr. Rawson-Clew was riding past, but slowly; it was quite possible to see
     his face, which did not contradict her former opinion—good-natured but foolish, and possibly
     weak. He turned in his saddle just below the window to speak to his companion, and she noticed
     that it was a stranger with him, a man wearing a single eyeglass, ten years older than the
     other, and of a totally different stamp. Indeed, of a stamp differing from any she had seen at
     Marbridge, so much so that she wondered how he came to be here, and what he was doing. But this
     was rather a waste of time, for the next day she knew.</p>
    <p>The next day he came down the street again, but this time alone and on foot. He stopped at
     No. 27, and there asked for Captain Polkington. Julia, hearing the knock, and the visitor
     subsequently being ushered into the dining-room, guessed it must be Mr. Gillat, perhaps come
     with his parcel again; when she saw Mary she asked her.</p>
    <p>"No, miss," was the answer; "it's another gentleman to see the master."</p>
    <p>"Who?" Julia's mind was alert for fresh difficulties.</p>
    <p>"Mr. Rawson-Clew."</p>
    <p>"I don't know who he is," Mary went on; "I've never set eyes on him before, but he's a grand
     sort of gentleman; I hardly liked to put him in the dining-room, only missis's orders was 'Mr.
     Gillat or any gentleman to see the master there.'"</p>
    <p>Which was true enough, and might reasonably have
     <pb n="21"/> been reckoned a safe order, for no one but Mr. Gillat ever did come to see the
     Captain.</p>
    <p>"I hope I've done right," Mary said.</p>
    <p>"Quite right," Julia answered, though she did not feel so sure of it. The name and the vague
     description of the visitor somehow suggested to her mind the stranger who had ridden past with
     young Mr. Rawson-Clew. She went up-stairs, uneasy as much from intuition as from experience. In
     the hall she stood a minute. The dining-room door did not shut too well, the lock was old and
     worn, and unless it was fastened carefully, it came open; the Captain never managed to fasten
     it, and now it stood ajar; Julia could hear something of what was said within almost as soon as
     she reached the top of the kitchen stairs. The visitor spoke quietly, his words were not
     audible, but the Captain's voice was raised with excitement.</p>
    <p>"The money, sir, the money that your cousin lent—accommodation between gentlemen—"</p>
    <p>So Julia heard incompletely, and then another disjointed sentence.</p>
    <p>"Do you take me for an adventurer, a sharper? I am a soldier, sir, a soldier and a
     gentleman—at least, I was—I mean I was a soldier, I am a gentleman—"</p>
    <p>Julia came swiftly up the hall, the instinct of the female to spread frail wings and protect
     her helpless belongings (old equally as much as young) was strong upon her. The pushed open the
     dining-room door and walked in.</p>
    <p>"Father," she said, "is anything the matter?"</p>
    <p>Both men turned, the stranger clearly surprised and annoyed by the interruption, the Captain
     for a moment thinking of pulling himself together and dismissing his daughter with a lie. But
     he did not do it; he was too shaken to think quickly, also there was a sense of re
     <pb n="22"/>inforcement in her presence; this he did not realise; indeed, he realised nothing
     except that she spoke again before he had collected himself.</p>
    <p>"Is it about the money Mr. Rawson-Clew lent you?" she asked.</p>
    <p>He nodded, and she turned to the other man, who had risen on her entrance, and now stood with
     his back to the evil-smelling stove which Mary had lighted as usual in honour of Captain
     Polkington's visitors. She measured him swiftly, and no detail escaped her; the well-bred
     impassive face, where the annoyance caused by her entrance showed only in the rather hard eyes;
     the straight figure, even the perfection of his tailoring and the style of his boots—she summed
     it all up with the rapidity of one who has had to depend on her wits before. And her wits were
     to be depended on, for, in spite of the warmth of her protective anger, she felt his
     superiority of person, position and ability, and, only too probably, of cause also. She could
     have laughed at the contrast he presented to her father and herself and the surroundings. It
     was perhaps for this reason that she asked him maliciously, "Have you come to collect the
     debt?"</p>
    <p>The question went home. "Certainly not," he answered haughtily; "the money—"</p>
    <p>But the Captain prevented whatever he was going to say. "He thinks I am an adventurer, a
     sharper," he bleated, now thoroughly throwing himself on his daughter's protection; "his
     intention seems to be a warning not to try to get anything more out of his cousin—something of
     that sort."</p>
    <p>Julia paid little attention to her father. "You were going to say," she inquired serenely of
     Rawson-Clew, "something about the money, I think?"</p>
    <p>
     <pb n="23"/></p>
    <p>"No," he answered, with cold politeness. "I only meant to suggest that this is perhaps rather
     an unpleasant subject for a lady."</p>
    <p>He moved as if he would open the door for her, but she stood her ground. "It is unpleasant,"
     she said; "for that reason had we not better get it over quickly? You have not come to collect
     the debt, you have come, then, for what?"</p>
    <p>"To make one or two things plain to Captain Polkington. I believe I have succeeded; if so, he
     will no doubt tell you anything you wish to know. Good afternoon," and he moved to the door on
     his own account, whereupon Julia's calmness gave way.</p>
    <p>"You do think my father an adventurer, then?" she said. "You think him a sharper and your
     cousin a gull, and you came to warn him that if he tried to get anything more in future it was
     you with whom he would have to deal. And the money—you were going to say the money was not what
     you came for because you never expected to see it again? But you are wrong there; you shall see
     it; it will be repaid, every penny of it."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew paused till she had finished; then, "I am sorry for any misunderstanding there
     may have been," he said. "I trust you will trouble yourself no farther in the matter," and he
     opened the door.</p>
    <p>It was not a denial; it was not, so Julia considered, even an apology; to her it seemed more
     like a polite request to mind her own business, and she went up to her room after he had gone
     almost unjustly angry, too angry for the time being to think about the rashness of her promise
     that the debt should be paid.</p>
    <p>"He thought us dirt," she said, sitting on the end of her narrow iron bed. Then she smiled
     rather grimly. "And we are pretty much what he thought us! Father sponged the money, and I
     decided to myself that the re
     <pb n="24"/>paying did not much matter. We are, as we looked to him, two grubby little people
     of doubtful honesty, in a grubby room with Bouquet," and she laughed outright, although she was
     alone, and the faculty for seeing and deriding herself as others might, had a somewhat bitter
     flavour. Nevertheless, she was very angry and quite determined to pay the money somehow, so
     that at least it should appear to this man that he was mistaken.</p>
    <p>An hour later she carried Captain Polkington's tea down to him; when tea was in the
     drawing-room his was always sent to him thus. She found him not depressed at all, on the
     contrary quite cheerful, and even dignified. He was reading something when she came in, and
     seeing that she was alone, he handed it to her. It was from Mr. Rawson-Clew she found, a sort
     of recognition of the discharge of the debt, or at least a formal cancelling of it. It was
     carefully and conclusively worded, certainly not the unaided work of the young man who had
     ridden past last night. It was dictated by the other, she was sure of it; possibly even he had
     himself discharged the debt so as to end the matter. Her eyes blazed as she read; he would not
     even allow her the satisfaction of giving him the lie—and the misery of straining and pinching
     to do the impossible. From pride, or from pity, or from both, he had finished the thing there
     and then, or he thought he had. She tore the paper across and then across again.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing?" Captain Polkington cried, seizing her hands as she would have torn it
     again. "Don't you know it is valuable? I must keep it; he can't go back on it if he wants to."
     He took it from her, and began to piece it together. "I can look the world in the face again,"
     he said, admiring the fragments. "I am free, free and cleared; that debt would have hung like a
     <pb n="25"/> millstone around my neck, but I am free of it; it is cancelled."</p>
    <p>"Free!" Julia said with scorn. There are disadvantages in reducing a man to a subordinate
     position and allowing him no use for his self-respect; it is a virtue that has a tendency to
     atrophy. Julia recognised this with something like personal shame. "Your debt is discharged,"
     she said gently, "but mine is not; it has been shifted, not cancelled; it lies with me and Mr.
     Rawson-Clew now, and it shall be paid somehow."</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington hardly heeded what she said; he was still smoothing the pieces of paper.
     "What?" he asked, as he put them away in an envelope, but he did not wait for her answer. "It
     was very heedless of you to tear it," he said; "but fortunately there is no damage done; it is
     perfectly valid, all that can be required."</p>

    <head>CHAPTER III</head>
    <head>NARCISSUS TRIANDRUS AZUREUM</head>
    <p>The <hi>élite</hi> called to congratulate Mrs. Polkington on her daughter's engagement. All
     manner of pleasant things were said by them and by Mrs. Polkington in an atmosphere of social
     sunshine. She thought it so nice of them to come so soon, she told them so severally; she knew
     that they—"you all," "you, at least," "you, my oldest friend," according to circumstances—would
     be pleased to hear about it. She gave sundry little hints of future plans and hopes, among
     other things mentioned that it really was hard for poor Violet to have to go and cheer an
     invalid cousin just now.</p>
    <p>"And the worst of it is," so Mrs. Polkington said, "she may have to be away some time. There
     really seems no one else to go, and one could not leave the poor dear alone at this dull time
     of the year; and, after all, Bath is not very far off; some of Richard's people live there,
     too. I should not be surprised if the young people contrive to see a good deal of each other in
     spite of everything. Indeed, had I not thought so, I think I should have insisted on Chèrie's
     going instead of Violet, although she would have had to give up her winter abroad."</p>
    <p>Here the visitor usually made polite inquiries about this same winter abroad, and heard of a
     delightful prospect of several months to be spent in the south of France, unnecessary and
     unpleasant details all omitted.
     <pb n="27"/></p>
    <p>"You do agree with me?" Mrs. Polkington would then ask rather anxiously, as if her hearer's
     opinion was the one that really mattered to her. "You do think it wrong to allow Chèrie to
     refuse this invitation for Violet's sake? I am very glad you think so. I had quite a difficulty
     in persuading her; but, as I told her, it was not a chance she was likely to have again. So she
     is going, and Violet will have to spend her winter in Bath. Julia? Oh, Julia was not asked in
     either case; she will be staying at home with me."</p>
    <p>From all of which it is clear that part of Julia's plan was to be adopted. The other part
     must have found favour, too, for soon it became known that the Polkingtons were without a
     servant. Mrs. Polkington made inquiries among her friends, but could not hear of any one
     suitable; she said it was very tiresome, especially as they had taken advantage of the girl's
     empty room to invite an old Anglo-Indian friend of her husband's to stay.</p>
    <p>Thus was the difficulty tided over, and with so good a face that few in Marbridge had any
     idea that it existed. Certainly none knew of the pinching and screwing and retrenching which
     went on indoors at No. 27. One or two tradesmen could have told of long accounts unpaid, and
     some relations living at a distance were troubled by appeals for help, a form of begging which,
     at this date of their history did not hurt the Polkingtons' sensibility much.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington suffered in body, if not in mind, during this hard time, though fortunately
     she was able to be away a month. The Captain suffered a good deal more, which was perhaps only
     just; and Johnny Gillat suffered with him, which was not just, though that did not seem to
     occur to him. As for Julia, she minded
     <pb n="28"/> least of any one, though in some ways she had the most to put up with; but the
     plan was hers, and consequently she was too interested in its success to trouble about the
     inevitable discomforts of the working out.</p>
    <p>There was one matter which did trouble her, however—the debt to Rawson-Clew. She had no
     money, and no possibility of raising any; yet it must and should be paid, for her father's name
     could not otherwise be cleared. She turned over in her own mind how she could earn enough, but
     there was little hope of that; it seemed rather a large sum for a girl to earn, and any sum was
     impossible to her; she had no gifts to take to market, no ability for any of the arts, not
     enough education for teaching, no training for commerce. The only field open to her was that of
     a nursery-governess or companion; neither was likely to enable her to pay this debt of honour
     quickly. Once, nearly a year ago, she had had a sort of half-offer of the post of companion. It
     was while she was staying with a friend; during the visit there had come to the house an old
     Dutchman of the name of Van Heigen, a business acquaintance of her host. He had stayed nearly a
     week, and in that time taken a great fancy to her.</p>
    <p>In those first bad days after the Captain's leaving the army, the Polkingtons had lived, or
     perhaps more accurately, drifted about, a good deal abroad. It was then that Julia picked up
     her only accomplishment, a working knowledge of several languages. She had also acquired one
     other thing, perhaps not an accomplishment, a rather unusual knowledge of divers men and divers
     ways. It may have been that these qualities made her more attractive to the old Dutchman than
     the purely English game-expert daughters of the house. Or it may have been her admirable
     cooking; the cook was ill during the greater part of her visit, and her offer to help was
     gladly ac
     <pb n="29"/>cepted and duly appreciated. Something, at all events, pleased the old man, so that
     before he left he asked her, half in fun, if she would come and live with his wife. This lady,
     it seemed, had bad health, and no daughters; she always had a companion of some sort, and was
     never satisfied with the one she had. In Holland, as in England, it seemed posts were not easy
     to fill satisfactorily, for those often in want of employment were also constitutionally
     inefficient.</p>
    <p>At the time Julia had laughingly refused the offer, now she recalled it, and thought
     seriously about it. It would not be very nice, a mixture of upper servant and lady help; the
     Van Heigens were bulb growers, old-fashioned people, the lady a thorough <hi>huisvrouw</hi>,
     nothing more probably. Still that did not matter; such things need not be considered if the end
     could be attained that way. But unfortunately it did not look very likely; the Van Heigens
     would pay less to a companion than English people would, not enough to buy clothes; there was
     practically nothing to be made out of it. Julia was obliged to admit the fact to herself, and
     reluctantly to dismiss the Dutchman and his offer from her thoughts.</p>
    <p>But curiously enough, they were brought to her mind again before long; not later, indeed,
     than that evening, when she went to a dance at a neighbour's house. At this dance she met a Mr.
     Alexander Cross. He was not a native of Marbridge, not at all like any of them; it is quite
     possible that they would have rather looked down upon him; Julia recognised that he barely came
     up to her mother's standard of a gentleman. He seemed to be a keen business man of the
     energetic new sort; he also seemed to deal in most things, flowers among them. He told Julia
     something about that part of his business, for he and it interested her so much that she asked
     him lead
     <pb n="30"/>ing questions. He explained how the beautiful orchid he wore in his coat had
     decreased in value lately. A few years ago, when there had been but one specimen with just that
     marking in all the world, the plant had sold for £900; now that it had been multiplied it was
     worth only £25, nothing practically.</p>
    <p>"It was a novelty then," he explained; "some novelties are worth a great deal. There's one I
     know of now I could do some good business with if I could get hold of it. But I can't; the old
     fool that's got it won't sell it for any price, and he can't half work it himself. It's a blue
     daffodil—Narcissus Triandrus Azureum he calls it; or rather, to give it its full title,
     Narcissus Triandrus Azureum Vrouw Van Heigen; so called, I believe, in honour of his wife, or
     his mother."</p>
    <p>Julia wondered if the Van Heigen who owned the precious flower was the old Dutchman of her
     acquaintance. "Is he a bulb grower?" she asked, though without giving any reason for her
     question.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Cross answered, "a Dutch bulb grower; that's why he won't make the profit he might; he
     comes of generations of growers, and they venerate their bulbs. He has cranky notions of how
     things ought to be done, and no other way will do for him."</p>
    <p>"How did he get a blue daffodil? Do you think it is real? It seems very unusual."</p>
    <p>"It is unusual; that's where the value comes in; but it's real fast enough, though I don't
     believe he grew the first, as he says, in his own garden. It's my opinion that one of his
     collectors sent him the first bulb; he has collectors all over the world, you know, looking for
     new things."</p>
    <p>"What is he going to do with it?" Julia asked.</p>
    <p>"He is multiplying it at present; at first he had only
     <pb n="31"/> one, now, of course, he has a few more; when he has got enough he will hybridise.
     You don't know what that is. Cross-breed with it; use the blue with the old yellow daffodil as
     parents to new varieties. That's ticklish work; growers can't afford to do it till they have a
     fair number of the new sort; but, of course, they occasionally get something good that
     way."</p>
    <p>Julia listened, much interested, though, to tell the truth, the money value of the thing
     fascinated her more than anything else.</p>
    <p>"Will he never sell any of his blue bulbs?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, in time," Cross answered; "but not while they are worth anything much to the
     growers."</p>
    <p>"What are they worth? I mean, what would it be worth if there was only one?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know; I dare say I could get £400 for the single bulb."</p>
    <p>"But if there were more they would not be worth so much? If there were five, what would they
     be worth?"</p>
    <p>"Pretty well as much, very likely £300 for one bulb. Van Heigen would give a written
     guarantee with it not to sell another bulb to another grower."</p>
    <p>"But he could keep the others himself?" Julia asked. "That would be eating his cake and
     having it too. Tell me," she said, feeling she was imitating the Patriarch when he was pleading
     for Sodom and Gomorrah, "if there were ten bulbs, what could you get for one."</p>
    <p>Cross was amused by her interest. "A hundred pounds, I dare say," he said; "but I shall never
     have the chance. The trade will never touch those blue daffodils while they are worth having.
     When the old man does begin to sell them—when they are worth very little to the growers—he will
     sell to collectors, cranky old connoisseurs, from choice. That's what I mean when I say he
     <pb n="32"/> doesn't understand business as business; he would rather sell his precious blue
     daffodils where they were what he calls 'appreciated.' He would sooner they went for a moderate
     price to people who would worship them, than make an enormous profit out of them."</p>
    <p>"But the connoisseurs could sell them," Julia objected. "If I were a connoisseur and bought
     one when they were for sale, I could sell it to you if I liked."</p>
    <p>"Yes, but you wouldn't," Cross said; "if you were a connoisseur you would not dream of
     parting with your bulb. You wouldn't have the slightest wish to make a hundred per cent. on
     your purchase, or two or three hundred either. Also I shouldn't buy."</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>"I couldn't afford to have my name mixed up with the business."</p>
    <p>Julia looked at him critically. "You could afford that the business should be done without
     your name?" she suggested.</p>
    <p>He laughed. "I could introduce the seller, did such an impossible person exist, to some one
     who could buy."</p>
    <p>It was Julia's turn to laugh, that soundless laugh of hers which gave the feeling of a joke
     only half shared. "For a consideration, of course," she said.</p>
    <p>"Something would naturally stick to my fingers," Cross answered, amused rather than
     offended.</p>
    <p>He was a good deal amused by his partner, finding her more interesting than most of the girls
     he met that evening; afterwards he forgot her, for two days later he left the place, and
     thought no more either about Miss Polkington or the talk he had had with her.</p>
    <p>As for her, it was not clear what she thought, but the next day she wrote to London for a
     second-hand Dutch dictionary, and then went to call at the house with the
     <pb n="33"/> largest library that she knew. When she came away from there she carried with her
     a book she had borrowed, a Dutch version of <hi>Gil Blas</hi>, which she remembered to have
     once seen tucked away in a corner. Shortly afterwards, as soon as the dictionary came, she set
     to reading the edifying work, and found it easier than she expected. What one learns from
     necessity in childhood stays in the memory, and a good knowledge of German and a smallish one
     of Dutch will carry one through greater difficulties than <hi>Gil Blas</hi>.</p>
    <p>Before her mother and sisters came back to Marbridge, Julia had written to the old
     Dutchman.</p>
    <p>When Mrs. Polkington heard Julia wanted to go to Holland and live in a Dutch family she was
     surprised. This news was not given to her till the spring had fairly set in, for it was not
     till then that Julia had been able to get everything arranged. It is no use telling people your
     plans unless you are quite sure of carrying them out, and you are never sure of that long
     before starting; at least, that was Julia's opinion. It was also her opinion that it was quite
     unnecessary to tell all details. She said she was tired of being at Marbridge, and wanted a
     complete change; also that when there were three grown-up sisters at home it seemed rather
     desirable that one should go away, for a time at least. When Violet suggested that it was odd
     to have chosen Holland in preference to France or Germany, she replied truthfully that the one
     was possible to her, the others were not.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington, who quite approved of the plan, saw no objection to Holland, adding as a
     recommendation, "It is so much more original to go there." She did not fail to remark on the
     originality when she embroidered Julia's going to her friends and acquaintances.</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington was the only member of the family
     <pb n="34"/> who regretted this going. He had always regarded Julia as something between an
     ally and a tolerant go-between; and since she had wrung from him the confession of his
     difficulties, and helped in the arrangement of them, his feeling for her had leaned more and
     more towards the former. He had even come to feel a certain protectiveness in her presence,
     which made him really sorry she was going. Johnny Gillat was sorrier still.</p>
    <p>Johnny had gone back to dismal lodgings in town now; he only heard of the plan by letter, and
     the Captain's letters were very prolix, and not informing. Mr. Gillat's own letters were even
     worse, for if they lacked the prolixity, they lacked the little information also. On receipt of
     the Captain's information he merely wrote to ask when Julia was going, and what time she would
     be in London, as he would like to give himself the pleasure of meeting her train.</p>
    <p>He did give himself that pleasure; he was at the station half an hour and ten minutes before
     the train, so as to be sure of being in time. He was on the platform when the train came in;
     Julia saw him, a rather ridiculous figure, his shabby coat tremendously brushed and tightly
     buttoned, a gay tie displayed to the uttermost to hide a ragged shirt front, his round, pink
     face, with its little grizzled moustache, wearing a look of melancholy which made it appear
     more than ordinarily foolish. He was standing where the part of the train which came from
     Marbridge could not possibly stop, much in the way of porters and trucks; Julia had to find him
     and find her luggage too, but he seemed to think he was of much service. Julia's hard young
     heart smote her when he gave twopence to her porter.</p>
    <p>"Johnny," she said, as he took her ticket on the District Railway, "I am going to pay for my ticket."
     <pb n="35"/></p>
    <p>It was only threepence, but there are people who have to consider the threepences; if Julia
     was one, she knew that Mr. Gillat was another, and she had allowed for this threepence, and he
     probably had not. He demurred, but she insisted. "Then I won't let you come with me;" and he
     gave way.</p>
    <p>They were alone in a compartment, and he shouted above the rattle of the train something
     about her being missed at Marbridge.</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," she said, "mother and the girls think it is a good thing I am going."</p>
    <p>"Your father and I will miss you," Johnny told her.</p>
    <p>"You?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; I'll miss you very much—we both shall; we shall sit down-stairs, each side of the
     fire-place, and think how you used to come there sometimes. And when I wait in the dining-room
     when your father's not at home, I'll remember how you used to come down there and chat. We had
     many a chat, didn't we?—you and me, and Bouquet burning between us—there was nobody could trim
     Bouquet like you. But perhaps you'll be back before winter comes round again?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know when I shall be back," was all Julia could find to say. The idea of being
     missed like this was new and strange to her; the Polkingtons' feelings were so much guided by
     what was advisable, or expedient, that there was not usually much room for simple emotions. She
     felt somehow grateful to Johnny for caring a little that she was going, though at the same time
     she was unpleasantly convinced that she did not deserve it.</p>
    <p>"It won't be at all the same at No. 27," Mr. Gillat was saying. "Your mother—she's a
     wonderful woman, a wonderful woman, and Miss Violet's a fine girl, so's the
     <pb n="36"/> other, handsome both of them; but they're in the drawing-room, you know, and
     you—you used to come down-stairs."</p>
    <p>It did not sound very explicit, but Julia understood what he meant. Just then the train
     stopped at a station, and other passengers got in, so they had little more talk.</p>
    <p>In time they reached Mark Lane, from whence it is no great walk to the Tower Stairs. There is
     a cheap way of going to Holland from there for those who do not mind spending twenty-four hours
     on the journey; Julia did not mind. When she and Johnny Gillat arrived at the Tower Stairs they
     saw the steamer lying in the river, a small Dutch boat, still taking in cargo from loaded
     lighters alongside. A waterman put them on board, or, rather, took them to the nearest waiting
     lighter, from whence they scrambled on board, Mr. Gillat very unhandily. A Dutch steward
     received them, and taking Johnny for a father come to see his daughter off, assured them in bad
     English that she would be quite safe, and well taken care of.</p>
    <p>"She shall haf one cabin to herself, a bed clean. Yes, yes; there is no passenger but one, a
     Holland gentleman; he will not speak with the miss, he is friend of captain."</p>
    <p>Johnny nodded a great many times, though he did not quite follow what was said. Then Julia
     told him he had better go, and not keep the waterman any longer.</p>
    <p>He agreed, and began fumbling in his pocket, from whence he pulled out one of his badly-tied
     parcels.</p>
    <p>"A keepsake," he said, putting it into her hand; then, without waiting to say good-bye, he
     scrambled over the side in such a hurry that he as nearly as possible fell into the river.</p>
    <p>Julia ran to the side in some anxiety; some one shouted, "Look out," and some one else, "Hold
     up," and
     <pb n="37"/> a third something less complimentary. Then a man laid hold of Mr. Gillat's legs
     and guided him safely on to the bobbing lighter. There he turned and waved his hat to Julia
     before he got into the waiting boat.</p>
    <p>"Good-bye," he called.</p>
    <p>"Good-bye," she answered. "Oh, do be careful!"</p>
    <p>He was not careful, but the waterman had him now, and took him ashore. She watched him, his
     round face was suffused with smiles; he waved his hat once more just as he reached the stairs.
     He slipped once getting up them, but he was up now, and turned to wave once before he started
     down the street.</p>
    <p>It was not till then that Julia became aware of a small sound close at hand; there was a good
     deal of noise going on, shouting, the rattling of cranes, and the thud of shifting bales, with
     now and then the hoot of a steamer and the escape of steam, and under all, the restless lapping
     of the water. But through it all she now heard a much smaller sound quite close, a regular
      <hi>tick</hi>, <hi>tick</hi>. She glanced at the parcel she had forgotten, then in an instant,
     as a sudden idea occurred to her, she had the paper off. Yes, it was. It was Johnny's great
     old-fashioned gold watch, with the fetter chain dangling at the end.</p>
    <p>She stood quite still with the thing in her hand, her mouth set straight, and her eyes
     growing glitteringly bright. The round gilded face stared up at her, reminding her in some
     grotesque way of Johnny; poor, generous, honest, foolish old Johnny! She looked away quickly, a
     sudden desire not to go with this moon-faced companion took possession of her—a desire not to
     go at all, a horrible new-born doubt about it.</p>
    <p>But feelings for abstract right and wrong, like personal likes and dislikes, do not grow
     strongly where ex
     <pb n="38"/>pediency and advisability and advantage have to rule; she was only going to do what
     she must in Holland; the debt must be paid, honour demanded no less; the blue daffodil was the
     only hope of paying it. She was not going to steal a bulb exactly; she was going to get it
     somehow, as a gift, perhaps, opportunity must show how; and when it was hers, she could do with
     it as she pleased, there was no wrong in that. She must go; she must do it; the thing was so
     necessary as to be unavoidable, and not open to question. She looked down, and her eye fell on
     the watch again; it stared up at her in the same vacant way as Johnny had done that day when he
     wanted to sell it and his other things to help them out of their justly earned, sordid
     difficulties. With shame she had prevented that, feeling the cause unworthy of the sacrifice.
     But this sacrifice, for a still more unworthy cause, she was too late to prevent. Johnny had
     gone. She looked earnestly to see if he was among those who loitered about the stairs, or those
     in the more distant street. But she could not see him, he was gone clean from sight; there was
     only the busy, unfamiliar life of the river around; yellow, sunlit water; the crowded craft,
     and the great stately wonder of the Tower Bridge silently raising and parting its solid roadway
     to let some boat go, as she would soon go down to the sea.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
    <head>THE OWNER OF THE BLUE DAFFODIL</head>
    <p>Vrouw Snieder, the notary's wife, sat by her window at work on a long strip of red crochet
     lace. From her place she could see all who came up the street, and, there being a piece of
     looking-glass set outside, at right angles to the pane, also most who came down it. This,
     though doubtless very informing, did not help the progress of the lace; but that was of no
     consequence, Mevrouw always had some red lace in making, and it might as well be one piece as
     another. With her, were her two daughters, Denah and Anna, though Anna had no business there,
     being supposed just then to be preparing vegetables for dinner. She had only come into the room
     to fetch keys, but a remark from her mother brought her to the window.</p>
    <p>"There goes Vrouw Van Heigen's English miss," the old lady said, and both her daughters
     looked at once.</p>
    <p>"She has been marketing, I see; she seems a good housewife."</p>
    <p>"She walks in the road," Denah observed critically; "It is so conspicuous, I could not do it;
     besides, one might be run over."</p>
    <p>"The English always walk in the road," her sister answered; "they think everything will get
     out of their way, and they do not at all mind being conspicuous."</p>
    <p>"The English miss should mind," Denah said, "for she is not pretty; no one looks at her to
     admire; besides she is poor and has to work hard."
     <pb n="40"/></p>
    <p>"Yes, yes," her mother agreed placidly; "she is a fine worker. Vrouw Van Heigen is full of
     her praises; such a cook—she has twenty new dishes, and everything is done quickly, one cannot
     tell how; it is like having a magician in the house, so she says. Ah, there is Herr Van de
     Greutz's Marthe going into the apothecary's. I wonder now—"</p>
    <p>But her daughters were not interested in Marthe; the English girl at the Van Heigens'
     interested them a great deal more. They continued to talk about her a great deal afterwards,
     Denah going back with her sister to the kitchen and the vegetables, so as to be able to do so
     undisturbed.</p>
    <p>"I will help you with these," she said; "then we can go out."</p>
    <p>She sat down and took up a knife. "It is strange how much Vrouw Van Heigen thinks of that
     girl," she said. "She has been there but one month and already there is no one like her. She
     does not keep her in her place very well; were she a daughter more could not be said. I wonder
     how Mijnheer likes it."</p>
    <p>"It was Mijnheer who engaged her," Anna said. "It is not likely that he regrets. I hear that
     she has written some English letters for him since one of the clerks has been ill. My father
     says she can cook like a Frenchwoman, and that is something. As for Joost, it is surely of
     little importance to him, he is too quiet to say anything to her; she talks little; she must be
     shy."</p>
    <p>Denah had nothing to say to this, although, seeing in which person her own interest in the
     Van Heigens lay, she possibly found some comfort in the assurance. After a little she remarked,
     "That girl has no accomplishments; she is as old-fashioned as our Aunt Barje, a
      <hi>huisvrouw</hi>,
     <pb n="41"/>no more. It is strange, for the English women make fun of us for this, and pretend
     that they are educated and advanced above us; she is not, she can do nothing but speak a few
     languages; she cannot sing nor play, she has read no science, she cannot draw, nor model in
     wax, nor make paper flowers, nor do bead work; she could not even crochet till I showed her
     how. I wonder if she has made any progress with the pattern I gave her. Shall we go and see by
     and by? I might set her right if she is in a difficulty, and we could at the same time inquire
     after Mevrouw's throat; she had a weakness, I noticed, on Tuesday."</p>
    <p>Anna agreed; she was a most obliging sister, and a while later they set out together for the
     Van Heigens' house. They did not walk in the wide, clean road, but were careful to keep to the
     path, pausing a moment to consult before starting for the other side when it was necessary to
     cross over.</p>
    <p>The Van Heigens' house stood on the outskirts of the town, a long way back from the road. The
     bulb garden lay all round it, though immediately in front was a lawn so soft and green that no
     one ever walked on it. The house was of wood, painted white, and had a high-pitched roof of
     strange, dark-coloured tiles; a canal lay on two sides, which ought to have made it damp, but
     did not.</p>
    <p>Vrouw Van Heigen was pleased to see the girls, and received them with an effusiveness which
     might have suggested that a longer time than four days had elapsed since they last met. She
     kissed them on both cheeks, and led them in by the hand; she asked particularly how they were,
     and how their mother was, and how their father was, and if they were not very tired with their
     walk, and would they not have lemonade—yes, they must have lemonade. "Julia, Julia," she
     called, "bring lemonade, bring glasses and the lemonade."
     <pb n="42"/></p>
    <p>Julia came from a little room which led off the sitting-room, carrying the things required on
     a papier-maché tray. She wore a large, blue-print apron, for she had been shelling shrimps when
     she was called, and though she stayed to wash her hands, she did not think it necessary to
     remove her apron. She had observed it to be the custom hereabouts to wear an apron of some sort
     all day long, and she did not differentiate between the grades of aprons as Denah and Anna did.
     She set down the tray and shook hands ceremoniously with the sisters and made all the proper
     inquiries in the properest way; she had also observed that to be the custom of the place. Then
     she poured out the lemonade and handed it round, and was afterwards sent to fetch a glass for
     herself and a little round tray to set it on—every one had a little tray for fear of spoiling
     the crimson plush table-cover. Julia cannot be said to have been anxious for lemonade; Vrouw
     Van Heigen's growing affection for her often found expression in drinks at odd times, a good
     deal more often than she appreciated. On this occasion, since she was doing the pouring out
     herself, she was able to get off with half a glass.</p>
    <p>They all sat round the table and talked; Julia talked a great deal the least, but that did
     not matter, the others had so much to say. She listened, admiring the way in which one little
     incident—a dog running on the tram line and being called off just in time by its owner—served
     them for a quarter of an hour. What economy of ideas it was, and how little strain to make
     conversation! Then came Mevrouw's throat, the little hoarseness Denah had noticed on Tuesday.
     It was nothing, the good lady declared, she had not felt it. Oh, if they insisted on noticing
     it, she would own to a weakness but no more than was usual to her when the dust was about, and
     truly the dust was
     <pb n="43"/> terrible now, she could not remember when it had been so bad so early in June. And
     so on, and so on, until they somehow came round to crochet lace, when Julia was obliged to
     confess that she had not made much progress with the pattern. She exhibited a very small piece
     with several mistakes in it.</p>
    <p>"Why," cried Denah, "I have done already almost half a metre of the piece I began at the same
     time. Is it difficult for you?"</p>
    <p>Julia said it was, and Vrouw Van Heigen added by way of apology for her, that she had been
     busy making a cool morning dress.</p>
    <p>"For yourself?" Anna asked. "Do you make your dresses?"</p>
    <p>"This is for Mevrouw," Julia answered; "but I can make my own."</p>
    <p>The Polkingtons had had to, and also to put an immense amount of thought and work into it,
     because they were bound to get a fine effect for a small expense, and that is not possible
     without a large outlay of time and consideration. Julia did not explain this to the present
     company, it would have been rather incomprehensible to them.</p>
    <p>Anna was at once fired with a desire to make herself a cool morning dress, and asked a dozen
     questions as to how, while Denah's busy fingers undid the faulty crochet work, and her tongue
     explained the mistakes. Mevrouw did not listen much to either, but noticing the glasses were
     empty, pressed the visitors in vain to have more lemonade. They refused, and finding them quite
     obdurate she toddled into the little room where Julia had been doing the shrimps, to come back
     again, bearing a large bladder-covered bottle of peach-brandy. The girls declined this very
     firmly, but Julia was sent for more glasses, and soon
     <pb n="44"/> they were all sipping the rich flavoured liqueur without protestation.</p>
    <p>It was over this that they planned an expedition to the wood. No one knew quite who suggested
     it; when people all talk at once it is not easy to say who originates an idea; anyhow, it was
     agreed that the weather was so dry and the trees so lovely and Mevrouw so seldom went out. She
     really felt—did she not?—that she would enjoy making a small excursion, she was so wonderfully
     well—for her. What did Anna think her mother would say? Perhaps they might join together for a
     drive?</p>
    <p>Anna thought her mother would be delighted; indeed, she often spoke of the charms of a
     country excursion; Denah was called upon to corroborate, and did so volubly. Where should they
     go? Half-a-dozen different places were suggested; why not go here, or there, or to the wood?
     Yes, the wood, that would be lovely. They could take their tea out; if they were well wrapped
     up, of course, protected from the damp and the wind, might it not be possible?</p>
    <p>So by degrees the plan was brought to the first stage. Denah and Anna were to talk it over
     with their mother, and if she thought favourably of it, then "we must see." By that time Denah
     had set the crochet work quite straight, and with kisses and hand-shakings the visitors
     departed. Julia went back to the little room where first she washed the glasses that had been
     used, afterwards she finished the shrimps and washed them and put them ready for supper in a
     china dish like a large soap dish on three feet. When that was done, it was necessary to lay
     the table for dinner and superintend the getting of that meal.</p>
    <p>The Van Heigens dined at four. It had taken Julia all the month she had been with them to in
     any way get used to that time. Mijnheer and the only son, Joost, came in
     <pb n="45"/> from the office for two hours then. The office joined the house and the great dim
     orderly bulb barns joined the office, so the father and son had not far to come in whichever
     place they might be. Julia and Mevrouw fetched the food from the kitchen and cleared the table,
     as well as getting their own meal; but that was nothing when you were used to it, any more than
     was the curious butter and nutmeg sauce that always seemed to play a part at dinner.</p>
    <p>Mijnheer had a good deal to say to Julia, principally about his business. The letters she had
     written for him during the illness of the clerk who usually did his English correspondence, had
     given her some little insight into it. This she had profited by, being in the first instance
     really interested, and, in the second, not slow to see that the old man, far from resenting it,
     had been pleased. He talked a good deal about his affairs now, giving her little bits of
     information and explaining rather proudly his method of doing business, and his father's and
     his grandfather's before him. Joost, as usual, said little or nothing; he must have been five
     or six and twenty, but he had hardly ever left the parental roof, and was usually so hard at
     work that he had little time or inclination for frivolity. He had earnest child-like blue eyes
     that Julia did not care to look at, any more than she did the round yellow face of Mr. Gillat's
     watch. This was rather a pity as she could not always avoid it, and certainly he looked at her
     a good deal, in fact whenever he thought he was not observed. Of course he always was observed,
     by her at least; that was a foregone conclusion; the observation gave her some uneasiness.</p>
    <p>After dinner the father and son went to sit on the veranda, and Mevrouw helped Julia take the
     dishes into the white marble kitchen and the glasses into the little
     <pb n="46"/>off-room. Later, Julia came to sit on the veranda, too—it was somewhat stuffy being
     all closed in with glass windows. There they drank pale tea, the pot kept simmering on a
     spirit-stove, and read the foreign papers which had just come. Mevrouw did not read, she made
     tea and did crochet work, a strip like Vrouw Snieder's, only yellow instead of red. Julia, it
     is to be feared, did not try to master the pattern so kindly set right by Denah; she could not
     resist the breath from the outside world which the papers brought.</p>
    <p>At six o'clock Mijnheer and his son went back to the office, and Julia, having washed the
     tea-cups, joined Mevrouw in the sitting-room. It was never very light in that room, for the
     walls were covered with a crimson flock paper and the woodwork was black; while the windows,
     which looked on the canal, were always shaded till dark. They sat here at work on the morning
     gown, till supper time. Mijnheer sometimes came in an hour before supper, as early as half-past
     eight; Joost had usually too much to do to come in before half-past nine. After supper, when
     the things were cleared away, they had prayers; Mijnheer read a chapter from the Bible, and
     they sat round the table and listened, and afterwards he said, "Now we will pray," and they sat
     a while in silence. Julia sat, too, her keen, observing eyes cast down and a curious stillness
     about her. After that every one went to bed; Julia and the maidservant had two little rooms
     right up in the eaves of the house; the family slept on the floor below. Julia was glad of
     this, though it was possible to imagine her room would be very hot in summer and very cold in
     winter. But she was glad to be well above the sleeping house, and to be able to look from her
     window across the wide country, over the dark bulb gardens—laid out like a Chinese puzzle with
     their eight-foot hedges—to the lights of the town on the one hand, and, better
     <pb n="47"/> still, to the dim curve of the Dunes on the other. It is to be feared she
     sometimes spent a longer time at her window than was wise, seeing the early hour at which she
     had to rise; but no one was troubled by it, for she was careful to take off her shoes first
     thing; the rooms were unceiled, and it was necessary to tread lightly if one would not disturb
     people below.</p>
    <p>On the day after that of Anna and Denah's visit, Herr Van Heigen offered to show Julia the
     bulb barns. It was a Saturday, and so after dinner, the workmen having all gone home, there was
     no one about and she could ascend the steep barn ladders without any suffering in her modesty.
     At least that was what Mijnheer thought; Julia, her modesty being of a very serviceable order,
     may have given the matter less consideration, but she accepted the offer.</p>
    <p>The barns were very large and high, many of them three storeys and each storey lofty. The
     light inside was dim, a sort of dun colour, and the air very dry and full of a strange, not
     unpleasant smell. Everything was as clean as clean could be; no litter, no dirt, the floor
     nicely swept, the shelves that ran all round and rose, tier upon tier, in an enormous stand
     that occupied the whole centre of the place, all perfectly orderly. On the shelves the bulbs
     lay, every one smooth and clean and dry, sorted according to kind and quality; Mijnheer knew
     them all; he could, like a book-lover with his books, put his hand upon any that he wished in
     the dark. It seemed to Julia that there were hundreds upon hundreds of different sorts. Not
     only hyacinths and tulips and such well-known ones in endless sizes and varieties, but little
     roots with six and seven syllable names she had never heard before, and big roots, too, and
     strange cornery roots, a never-ending quantity.
     <pb n="48"/></p>
    <p>Mijnheer told her they were not yet all in; many were in the ground and had still to be
     lifted. This she knew, for she had seen the dead tops of some in the little enclosed squares
     where they grew; from her bedroom window, too, she saw others still in bloom—a patch, the size
     of a tennis-lawn squared, of scarlet ranunculous, little blood-red rosettes, sheltered by a
     high close-clipped hedge. And another patch of iris hispanica, fairy flowers of palest gold and
     lavender, quivering at the top of their grey-green stalks like tropical dragon-flies hovering
     over a field of growing oats. These it seemed, and many others, would be brought in by and by,
     then the great barns would be really full. Mijnheer took up a root here and there, telling her
     something of the history of each; explaining how the narcissus increased and the tulips grew;
     showing her hyacinth bulbs cut in half-breadthways with all the separate severed layers
     distended by reason of the growing and swelling of the seeds between.</p>
    <p>"Each little seed will be a bulb by and by," he said, "but not yet. When we cut the root
     first, we set it in the ground and these begin to grow and become in time as you see them now.
     Afterwards they grow bigger and bigger till their parent can no longer contain them."</p>
    <p>"Does it take long for them to grow full size?" Julia asked.</p>
    <p>"It takes five years to grow the finest hyacinth bulbs," Mijnheer answered, "but inferior
     ones are more quick. And when the bulb is grown, there is one bloom—fine, magnificent, a truss
     of flowers—after that it deteriorates, it is, one may say, over. Ah, but it is magnificent
     while it is there! There is no flower like the hyacinth; had I my way, I would grow nothing
     else, but people will not have them now. They must have novelties. 'Give us narcissus,' they
     say; 'they are so graceful'—I do not see
     <pb n="49"/> the grace—'Or iris'—well, some are fine, I allow, but they do not last in bloom as
     do hyacinths. The mourn iris of Persia is very beautiful; we have not one flowering yet, but we
     shall have by and by. I will show you then; you will think it very handsome. When it blooms I
     go to it in the morning and dust the sand from the petals. I feel that I can reverence that
     flower; it is most beautiful."</p>
    <p>"Is it very scarce?" Julia asked.</p>
    <p>"Somewhat," Mijnheer answered; "but we have things that are more so, we have many novelties
     so called. Ah, but we have one novelty that is a true one, it is a wonder, it has no price, it
     is priceless!" He drew a deep breath of almost awed pride. "It is the greatest rarity that has
     ever been reared in Holland, a miracle, in fact—a blue daffodil!"</p>
    <p>Julia refrained from mentioning that she had heard of the rarity before; she leaned against
     the centre stand and listened while the old man grew eloquent, with the eloquence of the
     connoisseur, not the tradesman, over his treasure. There was no need for her to say much, only
     to put a question here and there, or make a sympathetic comment; with little or no effort she
     learned a good deal about the wonderful bulb. It seemed that it really had been grown in the
     Van Heigens' gardens, and not imported from Asia, as Mr. Cross thought. There were six roots by
     this time; not so many as had been hoped and expected, it did not increase well, and was
     evidently going to be difficult to grow.</p>
    <p>"Would you like to know the name which it will immortalise?" the old man asked at last. "It
     is called Narcissus Triandrus Azurem Vrouw Van Heigen."</p>
    <p>"You named it in honour of Mevrouw, I suppose?" Julia said.</p>
    <p>"I did not; Joost did."
     <pb n="50"/></p>
    <p>"Mijnheer Joost?" she repeated.</p>
    <p>"Yes," the father answered. "It is his, not mine; to him belongs the honour. It is he who has
     produced this marvel. How? That is a secret; perhaps even I could not tell you if I would;
     Nature is wonderful in her ways; we can only help her, we cannot create. Yes, yes, it is Joost
     who has done this. He seemed to you a retiring youth? Yet he is the most envied and most
     honoured man of our profession. I would sooner—there are many men in Holland who would
     sooner—have produced this flower than have a thousand pounds. And he is my son—you may well
     believe that I am proud."</p>
    <p>And Mijnheer beamed with satisfaction in his son and his blue daffodil. But Julia leaned
     against the stand in the dry twilight, saying nothing. Money, it appeared, was not then the
     measure of all things; neither intrinsically, as with Mr. Alexander Cross, nor for what it
     represented in comfort and position, as with her own family, did it rank with these bulb
     growers. They, these people whom her mother would have called market gardeners, tradespeople,
     it seemed, loved and reverenced their work; they thought about it and for it, were proud of it
     and valued distinction in it, and nothing else. The blue daffodil was no valuable commercial
     asset, it was an honour and glory, an unparalleled floral distinction—no wonder Cross could not
     buy or exploit it. In a jump Julia comprehended the situation more fully than that astute
     business man ever could; but at the same time she felt a little bitter amusement—it was this,
     this treasured wonder, that she thought to obtain.</p>
    <p>The next day, Sunday, Julia went to church with Mijnheer and Joost; Mevrouw did not find
     herself well enough for church, but she insisted that Julia should not stay at home on her
     account. Accordingly the girl accompanied
     <pb n="51"/> father and son to the Groote Kerk and listened to the rather dull service there.
     For the most part she sat with her eyes demurely cast down, though once or twice she looked
     round the old barn-like place, and wondered if there were any frescoes under the whitewash of
     the walls and whence came the faint, all pervading smell, like a phantom of incense long
     forgotten. When service was over and they came out into the sunny street, Mijnheer announced
     that he was going to see a friend. Julia, of course, must hurry home to set the table for the
     mid-day coffee drinking, and afterwards prepare for dinner. Joost was going back, likewise, and
     to her it was so natural a thing they should go together that she never thought about it. It
     did not, however, seem so to him, and after walking a few paces in embarrassment, he said—</p>
    <p>"You would perhaps prefer I did not walk with you?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," she answered, in some surprise; "I shall be pleased, if you are going the same way,
     that is."</p>
    <p>He fidgeted, becoming more embarrassed. "You are sure you do not mind?" he said. "It is a
     little conspicuous for you."</p>
    <p>Then she understood, and looked up with twinkling eyes. "I am afraid I am conspicuous,
     anyhow," she said.</p>
    <p>This was true enough, for her clothes, fitting like an Englishwoman's, and put on like a
     Frenchwoman's (the Polkingtons all knew how to dress), were unlike any others in sight. Her
     face, too, dark and thin and keenly alert, was unlike, and her light, easy walk; and if this
     was not enough it must be added that she was now walking in the road because the pavement was
     so crowded.</p>
    <p>Joost stepped off the path to make room for her and she saw by his face that his mind was not
     at ease.</p>
    <p>"Pray, Mijnheer," she said, in her softest tones, and
     <pb n="52"/> her voice had many tones as her companion had not failed to notice, though he was
     not aware that the softest was also usually the most mischievous, "will you not walk the other
     side of the way? Then you will not be conspicuous at all."</p>
    <p>"I do not mind it," he said, blushing, and Julia decided that his father's description of him
     as a retiring youth was really short of the mark. They walked along together down the quiet,
     bright streets; there were many people about, but nobody in a hurry, and all in Sunday clothes,
     bent on visiting or decorous pleasure-making. Everywhere was sunny and everything looked as if
     it had had its face washed; week days in the town always looked to Julia like Sundays, and
     Sundays, this Sunday in particular, looked like Easter.</p>
    <p>In time they came to the trees that bordered the canal; there were old Spanish houses here, a
     beautiful purplish red in colour, and with carving above the doors. Julia looked up at her
     favourite doorpiece—a galleon in full sail, a veritable picture in relief, unspoiled by three
     hundred years of wind and weather.</p>
    <p>"I think this is the most beautiful town I was ever in," she said. Her companion looked
     surprised.</p>
    <p>"Do you like it?" he asked. "It must be quite unlike what you are used to, all of it must
     be."</p>
    <p>"It is," she answered, "all of it, as you say—the place, the ways, the people."</p>
    <p>"And you like it? You do not think it—you do not think us what you call slow, stupid?"</p>
    <p>She was a little surprised, it had never occurred to her that he, any more than the others,
     would think about her point of view. "No," she answered, "I admire it all very much, it is
     sincere, no one appears other than he is, or aims at being or seeming more. Your house is the same
     <pb n="53"/> back and front, and you, none of you have a wrong side, the whole life is solid
     right through."</p>
    <p>Joost did not quite understand; had she not guessed that to be likely she would hardly have
     spoken so frankly. "I fear I do not understand you," he said; "it is difficult when we do not
     know each other's language perfectly."</p>
    <p>"We know it very well," Julia answered; "as well as possible. If we were born in the same
     place, in the same house, we should not understand it better."</p>
    <p>He still looked puzzled; he was half afraid she was laughing at him. "You think I am stupid?"
     he said, gravely.</p>
    <p>She denied it, and they walked on a little in silence. They were in the quieter part of the
     town now and could talk undisturbed; after a little he spoke again, musingly.</p>
    <p>"Often I wonder what you think of, you have such great, shining eyes, they eat up everything;
     they see everything and through everything, I think. They sweep round the room, or the persons
     or the place, and gather all—may I say it?—like some fine net—to me it seems they draw all
     things into your brain, and there you weave them and weave them into thoughts."</p>
    <p>Julia swallowed a little exclamation, and by an effort contrived not to appear as surprised
     as she was by this too discerning remark. She was so young that she did not before know that
     children and child-like folk sometimes divine by instinct the same conclusions that very clever
     people arrive at by much reasoning and observation. She felt decidedly uncomfortable at this
     explanation of Joost's frequent contemplations of herself.</p>
    <p>"You seem to think me very clever," she said.</p>
    <p>"Of course," he answered simply, "you are clever."</p>
    <p>"No, I am not," she returned; "ask your mother; ask Denah Snieder; they do not think me
     clever. What can
     <pb n="54"/> I do, except cook? Oh, yes, and speak a few foreign language as you can yourself?
     I cannot paint, or draw, or sing; I do not understand music; why, when you play Bach, I wish to
     go out of the room."</p>
    <p>"That is true," he admitted; "I have felt it."</p>
    <p>Julia bit her lip; she had never before expressed her opinion of Bach, and she did not feel
     in the least gratified that he had found it out for himself.</p>
    <p>"It is absurd to call me clever," she said. "I have little learning and no accomplishments. I
     cannot even get on with the crochet work Denah showed me, and I do not know how to make flowers
     of paper."</p>
    <p>"But why should one make flowers of paper?" he asked, in his serious way. "They are not at
     all beautiful."</p>
    <p>"Denah makes them beautifully," she answered.</p>
    <p>The argument did not seem to carry weight, but Julia advanced no other; she thought silence
     the wisest course. They had almost reached home now; a little before they came to the gate,
     Joost opened the subject of herself again. "I think sometimes you must make fun of us; do you
     not sometimes in your heart laugh just a little bit?"</p>
    <p>"I laugh at everything sometimes," she said; "myself most of all. Do you never laugh at
     yourself? I expect not; you are very serious. I will tell you what it is like: a little goblin
     comes out of your head and stands in front of you; the goblin is you, a sort of you; the other
     part, the part people know, sits opposite, and the goblin laughs at it because it sees how
     ridiculous the other is, how grotesque and how futile. My goblin came out into my room last
     night and laughed and laughed; you would almost have heard him if you had been there."</p>
    <p>They had reached the gate now, and as Joost held it open for her to pass through, she saw
     that he had blushed to the ears at the lightly spoken words—if he had been
     <pb n="55"/> in her room last night; the impropriety of them to him was evident. For a moment
     she blushed, too, then she recovered herself and grew impatient with one so artificial—and yet
     so simple, so self-conscious—and yet so unconscious, so desperately stupid—and yet so
     uncomfortably clear-sighted.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER V</head>
    <head>THE EXCURSION</head>
    <p>The following Monday was fine and warm, and since the whole previous week had also been fine
     and warm, Mevrouw thought they might venture to make the talked-of excursion. Messages were
     accordingly sent to the Snieders, and from the Snieders back again, and after a wonderful
     amount of talk and arranging, everything was settled. Dinner was a little early that day, and a
     little hurried, though, since the carriage was not to come till after five o'clock, there was
     perhaps not much need for that. However, it is not every day in the week one makes an
     excursion, so naturally things cannot be expected to go quite as usual when such an event
     occurs.</p>
    <p>The carriage came, Mevrouw had been waiting ten minutes, and three times been to see why
     Julia was not waiting with her. At the sound of wheels Julia came out; she had just finished
     washing the glasses (which she had been told not to touch, as there was certainly no time). She
     was quite ready, but Mevrouw at that moment discovered that she had the wrong sunshade. Julia
     fetched the right one and carried it out for the old lady; also an umbrella with a bow on the
     handle, a mackintosh, a shawl, and a large basket. Mijnheer came from the office with his
     spectacles pushed up on his forehead, and a minute later Joost also came to say good-bye; even
     the maidservant came from the kitchen to see them start.</p>
    <p>The carriage drew up; it was a strange-looking vehicle,
     <pb n="57"/> in shape something between a hearse and an ark on wheels, but with the greater
     part of the sides open to the air. Vrouw Snieder and her two daughters were already within,
     with their bow-trimmed umbrellas, sunshades, mackintoshes, shawls and basket. There was
     necessarily a good deal of greeting; Mijnheer and Joost shook hands with all the three ladies,
     and inquired after Herr Snieder, and received polite inquiries in return. Then Denah insisted
     on getting out, so that Mevrouw should be better able to get in; also to show that she was
     athletic and agile, like an English girl, and thought nothing of getting in and out of a high
     carriage. Mevrouw kissed her husband and son, twice each, very loud, called a good-bye to the
     servant, and got in. Julia shook hands, said good-bye, and also got in. Denah watched her, and
     observed the shape of her feet and ankles jealously. She glanced sharply at Joost, but he was
     not guilty of such indecorum as even thinking about any girl's legs, so, having said her
     good-bye, she got in reassured. Finally they drove away amid wishes for a safe drive and a
     pleasant excursion.</p>
    <p>Of course there was a little settling to do inside the carriage, the wraps and baskets to be
     disposed of, and each person to be assured that the others had enough room, and just the place
     they preferred to any other. By the time that was done they stopped again at the house of
     Mijnheer's head clerk; here they were to take up two children, girls of fourteen and fifteen,
     who had been invited to come with the party. The carriage was not kept waiting, the children
     were out before it had fairly stopped; they were flaxenly fair girls, wearing little blue
     earrings, Sunday hats, and cotton gloves of course—all the party wore cotton gloves; it was,
     Julia judged, part of the excursion outfit.
     <pb n="58"/></p>
    <p>Now they were really off, driving out beyond the outskirts of the town; along flat roads
     where the wheels sank noiselessly into the soft sand, and the horses' feet clattered on the
     narrow brick track in the centre. For a time they followed the canal closely, but soon they
     left it, and saw in the distance nothing but its high green banks, with the brown sails of
     boats showing above, and looking as if they were a good deal higher than the carriage road.
     They passed small fields, subdivided into yet smaller patches, and all very highly cultivated.
     And small black and white houses, and small black and white cows, and black and white goats,
     and dogs, and even cats of the same combination of colour. Everything was rather small, but
     everywhere very tidy; nothing out of its place or wasted, and nobody hurrying or idling; all
     were busy, with a small bustling business, as unlike aggressive English idleness as it was
     unlike the deceptive, leisurely power of English work.</p>
    <p>Denah and Anna looked out of either side of the carriage, and pointed out things to Julia and
     the two little girls. Here it was what they called a country seat, a sort of castellated
     variety of overgrown chalêt, surrounded by a wonderful garden of blazing flower-beds and
     emerald lawns, all set round with rows and rows of plants in bright red pots. Or there it was a
     cemetery, where the peaceful aspect made Denah sentimental, and the beauty of the trees drew
     Anna's praise. The two elder ladies paid less attention to what they passed; they contented
     themselves with leaning back and saying how beautiful the air was, and how refreshing the
     country. The girls said that as well; they all agreed six times within the hour that it was a
     delightful expedition, and they enjoying it much.</p>
    <p>In time they came to the wood. An unpaved road ran
     <pb n="59"/> through it of soft, deep sand, which deadened every sound; on either hand the
     trees rose, pines and larch and beech principally, with a few large-leafed shivering poplars
     here and there. There was no undergrowth, and few bird songs, only the dim wood aisles
     stretching away, quiet and green. Suddenly it seemed to Julia that the world's horizon had been
     stretched, the little neatness, the clean, trim brightness, the bustling, industrious toy world
     was gone; in its place was the twilight of the trees, the silence, the repose, the haunting,
     indefinable sense of home which is only to be found in these cathedrals of Nature's making.</p>
    <p>"Ah, the wood!" Denah said, with a profound sigh. "The beautiful wood! Miss Julia, do you not
     love it?"</p>
    <p>Julia did not assent, but Denah went on quite satisfied, "You cannot love it as I do; I think
     I am a child of Nature, nothing would please me more than always to live here."</p>
    <p>"You would have to go into the town sometimes," Julia said, "to buy gloves; the ones you have
     would not last for ever."</p>
    <p>Denah looked a little puzzled by the difficulty; she had not apparently thought out the
     details of life in a natural state; but before she could come to any conclusion one of the
     little girls cried, "Music—I hear music!"</p>
    <p>All the ladies said "Delicious!" together, and "How beautiful!" and Denah, content to ignore
     Nature, added rapturously, "Music in the wood! Ah, exquisite! two beauties together!"</p>
    <p>Julia echoed the remark, though the music was that of a piano-organ. The horizon had drawn in
     again, and the prospect narrowed; the silence was full of noises now, voices and laughter,
     amidst which the organ notes did not seem out of place. And near at hand under the
     <pb n="60"/> trees there were tables spread and people having tea, enjoying themselves in a
     simple-hearted, noisy fashion, in no way suggestive of cathedral twilight.</p>
    <p>The carriage was put up, the tea ordered, and in a little they, too, were sitting at one of
     the square tables. Each lady was provided with a high wooden chair, and a little wooden box
     footstool. A kettle on a hot potful of smouldering wood ashes was set on the table; cups and
     saucers and goats' milk were also supplied to them, and opaque beet-root sugar. The food they
     had brought in their baskets, big new <hi>broodje</hi> split in half, buttered and put together
     again with a slither of Dutch cheese between. These and, to wind up with, some thin sweet
     biscuits carried in a papier-maché box, and handed out singly by Vrouw Van Heigen, who had
     brought them as a surprise and a treat.</p>
    <p>"Do they have such picnics as this in England?" Anna asked, as she gathered up the crumbs of
     her biscuit.</p>
    <p>"I have never been to one," Julia answered, and inwardly she thought of her mother and Violet
     driving in a wheeled ark to the wood, there to sit at little wooden tables and stretch their
     mouths in the public eye.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" said Vrouw Snieder; "then it is all the more of a pleasure and a novelty to you."</p>
    <p>Julia said it was, and soon afterwards they rose from the table to walk in the wood. The two
     elder ladies did not get far, and before long came back to sit on their wooden chairs again.
     The girls went some little distance, all keeping together, and being careful not to wander out
     of sight and sound of the other picnic parties. Once when they came to the extreme limit of
     their walk, Julia half-hesitated. She looked into the quiet green distance. It would be easy to
     leave them, to give them the slip; she could walk at double their pace with half their exer
     <pb n="61"/>tion, she could lose herself among the trees while they were wondering why she had
     gone, and making up their minds to follow her; and, most important of all, when she came back
     she could explain everything quite easily, so that they would not think it in the least
     strange—an accident, a missing of the way, anything. Should she do it—should she? The wild
     creature that had lived half-smothered within her for all the twenty years of her life
     fluttered and stirred. It had stirred before, rebelling against the shams of the Marbridge
     life, as it rebelled against the restrictions of the present; it had never had scope or found
     vent; still, for all that it was not dead; possibly, even, it was growing stronger; it called
     her now to run away. But she did not do it; advisability, the Polkingtons' patron saint,
     suggested to her that one does not learn to shine in the caged life by allowing oneself the
     luxury of occasional escape.</p>
    <p>She turned her back on the green distance. "Shall we not go back to where the music is
     playing?" she said.</p>
    <p>They went, walking with their arms entwined as other girls were doing, Julia between the
     broad, white-skinned sisters, like a rapier between cushions. The two younger girls ran on in
     front. "There is Mevrouw," they cried. "She is calling us. The carriage is ready, too; oh, do
     you think it is already time to go?"</p>
    <p>It seemed as if it really was the case. Vrouw Snieder stood clapping her hands and beckoning
     to them, and the coachman appeared impatient to be off. With reluctance, and many times
     repeated regrets, they collected their wraps and baskets, and got into the carriage.</p>
    <p>"Good-bye, beautiful wood, good-bye!" Denah said, leaning far out as they started. "Oh, if
     one could but remain here till the moon rose!"
     <pb n="62"/></p>
    <p>"It would be very damp," her mother observed. "The dew would fall."</p>
    <p>To which incontestable remark Denah made no reply.</p>
    <p>The return journey was much like the drive there, with one exception; they passed one object
     of interest they had not seen before. It was when they were nearing the outskirts of the town
     that Anna exclaimed, "An Englishman! Look, look, Miss Julia, a compatriot of yours!"</p>
    <p>The season was full early for tourists, and at no time did the place attract many. Englishmen
     who came now probably came on business which was unlikely to bring them out to these quiet,
     flat fields. But Anna and Denah, who joined her in a much more demonstrative look-out than
     Marbridge would have considered well-bred, were insistent on the nationality.</p>
    <p>"He walks like an Englishman," Anna said, "as if all the world belonged to him."</p>
    <p>"And looks like one," Denah added; "he has no moustache, and wears a glass in his eye, look,
     Miss Julia."</p>
    <p>Julia looked, then drew back rather quickly. They were right, it was an Englishman; it was of
     all men Rawson-Clew.</p>
    <p>What was he doing here? By what extraordinary chance he came to be in this unlikely place she
     could not think. She was very glad that Mevrouw felt the air chilly, and so had had the leather
     flaps pulled over part of the open sides of the carriage; this and the eager sisters screened
     her so well that it was unlikely he could see her.</p>
    <p>"Is he not an Englishman?" Anna asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes," she answered; "one could not mistake him for anything else."</p>
    <p>"I wonder if he recognised you as a country-woman,"
     <pb n="63"/> Anna speculated; and Julia said she did not consider herself typically English in
     appearance.</p>
    <p>The sisters talked for the rest of the way of the Englishman; of his air and bearing, and the
     fact, of which they declared themselves convinced, that he was a person of distinction.</p>
    <p>But it was not till the drive was over, and the party had separated, that Denah was able to
     say what was burning on her tongue. They had left the clerk's children at their house, said
     good-bye to Vrouw Van Heigen and Julia, and were within their own home at last; the girls went
     up to their bedroom, and Denah carefully fastened the door, then she said mysteriously, "Miss
     Julia knows that Englishman."</p>
    <p>Anna jumped at the intelligence, and still more at the tone. "Did she tell you?" she
     asked.</p>
    <p>"No," Denah replied with some scorn; "she would not tell any one, she wishes it concealed;
     she thinks it is so, but I saw it."</p>
    <p>The tone and manner suggested many things, but Anna was a terribly matter-of-fact person, to
     whom suggestions were nothing. "Why should she wish it concealed?" she inquired.</p>
    <p>"I do not know why," Denah answered; "that remains to be seen. As for how I know it, I saw it
     in her face; when she looked at him her lips became set, and her eyes—she looked—" She
     hesitated for a word, and dropped to the homely, "She looked as if she would bite with
     annoyance that he should be here. The expression was gone in a moment; she spoke with an ease
     and naturalness that was astonishing, even disgusting; but it had been there. I do not trust
     her."</p>
    <p>The last was said with great seriousness, and for a little Anna was impressed. But not for
     long, she could
     <pb n="64"/> not accept such evidence as this; in her opinion it was "fancy."</p>
    <p>"You read too many romances," she said; "your head is full of such things. I do not believe
     Miss Julia knew the Englishman, she would not have hidden from us her knowledge if she did; it
     is not so easy to hide one's feelings in the flash of an eye, besides there was no reason.
     Also"—this as an afterthought—"he was a man of good family; you could see at a glance that he
     was of the aristocracy, while she is a paid companion to Vrouw Van Heigen; she could never
     before have met him."</p>
    <p>Denah, however, was not convinced; she only repeated darkly, "I mistrust her."</p>
    <p>Julia, in the meantime, was busy with her household duties, talking over the excursion the
     while with Mevrouw, and helping to detail it to Mijnheer. At last the table was ready for
     supper and the coffee made. Mevrouw sat with her crochet, and Mijnheer opposite her with his
     paper. It wanted more than a quarter of an hour to supper time, Julia had been too quick; still
     it did not matter, the coffee would not hurt standing on the spirit-stove; it stood there half
     the day. She had all this time to spare, but she did not fetch her crochet work; she went
     outside to the veranda.</p>
    <p>It was almost dark by this time, as dark as it ever got on these nights; the air was still
     and warm. She opened the glass door and went out and sat down on the step. There was a smell of
     water in the air, not unpleasant, but quite un-English, and mixed with it a faint smell of
     flowers, the late blooming bulbs have little scent on the whole; it was more the heavy dew than
     the flowers themselves which one could smell. It was very quiet out here; the town, at no time
     noisy, was some distance away—so quiet that Julia could hear the ticking of Mr. Gillat's
     <pb n="65"/> large watch in her belt. She pushed it further down; she did not want to hear
     it.</p>
    <p>She propped her elbows on her knees, and her chin on her hands. She wished she had not seen
     Rawson-Clew that day; she wished she was not here, she wished there was no such thing as a blue
     daffodil; she was vaguely angry and dissatisfied, but not willing to face things. It was
     unlikely that the man had seen her, unlikely that she would see him again; but he was
     incongruous in this simple life, and he brought forcibly home the incongruity of herself and
     her errand. She had come for the blue daffodil, it was no good pretending she had not; she told
     herself angrily, as she had told herself when she had first looked at Johnny's yellow-faced
     watch, that she was going to get it in some way that was justifiable. Only it was not so easy
     to believe that now she knew more about it and the Van Heigens. But she must have it, that was
     the argument she fell back on, the necessity was so great that she was justified (the
     Polkingtons had always found necessity a justification for doing things that could be anyhow
     made to square with their position).</p>
    <p>She wished she had not been for the excursion to-day, that she lived less really in their
     simple, sincere life. She wished from her heart that the Van Heigens had been different sort of
     people—almost any other sort, then she would not have had these tiresome feelings—Johnny and
     Johnny's watch, Joost Van Heigen—there was something about them all that was hatefully
     embarrassing. No self-respecting thief robbed a child; even the most apathetic conscience
     revolted at such an idea. No gentleman worthy of the name attacked an unarmed man, the
     preparedness of the parties made all the difference between murder and fair fight. Of course,
     in the abstract, stealing was stealing under all conditions, and killing killing,
     <pb n="66"/> and both open to condemnation; but in the concrete, in fact, the equality of the
     two persons made all the difference, at least to honour.</p>
    <p>Julia moved uneasily and looked, without seeing, across the dark garden. The monotonous sound
     of voices floated out indistinctly; the old pair in the sitting-room were talking in the
     lamplight, Mevrouw going over once again the little incidents of the day. Joost was in the
     drawing-room at the other end of the house; he had been playing some of his favourite composer;
     he had stopped now, and was doubtless sorting his music and putting it away, each piece
     four-square and absolutely neat. Day by day, and year by year, they lived this quiet life, with
     a drive for a rare holiday treat, and the discovery of a new flower as the goal of all hope and
     ambition. Things did not happen to them, bad things that needed doubtful remedies; they had
     never had to scratch for their living, and show one face outwards and another in. They, none of
     them, ever wanted to do things; they had not the courage. How much of virtue was lack of
     courage and a desire not to be remarkable?</p>
    <p>Julia asked herself the question defiantly, and did not hear Joost come out of the house. He
     was carrying a lantern, and was going to make his nightly round of the barns. She did not hear
     his step, and so started when she saw the light swing across the ground at her feet.</p>
    <p>He was quite as startled to see her as she was to see him, but his greeting was a very usual
     question in Holland, "Will you not catch cold?"</p>
    <p>She shook her head, and he asked, "What are you doing? Thinking? Weaving in your head all
     that you have seen and heard to-day?"</p>
    <p>"No," she answered; "I was thinking about courage."</p>
    <p>"Courage?" he repeated, puzzled.
     <pb n="67"/></p>
    <p>"Yes, it is very different in different places; some people are afraid to tell the truth, so
     they lie; and some are afraid to be dishonest, so they are honest; I believe it depends partly
     on fashion."</p>
    <p>Joost set down the lantern in sheer surprise. "Such things cannot depend on fashion," he said
     severely.</p>
    <p>"I am not so sure," Julia answered; "lots of things you would not expect depend on it. I know
     people who sometimes go without the food they want so that they can buy expensive cakes to show
     off when their acquaintances come to tea—that's silly, isn't it? Then I know other people who
     blush if a pair of breeches, or something equally inoffensive, are mentioned; that seems
     equally silly. One lot of people is ashamed to be seen eating bread-and-cheese suppers, another
     lot is ashamed to be seen walking off the side-walk, and with no gloves on. One would hardly
     expect in, yet I almost believe these silly little things somehow make a difference to what the
     people think right and wrong."</p>
    <p>Joost regarded her doubtfully, though he could only see the outline of her face. "Are you
     making fun?" he asked. "I do not know when you are making fun; I think you must be now. Are you
     speaking of us?"</p>
    <p>"I never felt less like making fun in my life," Julia answered ignoring the last question.
     Something in her tone struck Joost as sad, and he forgot his question in sympathy.</p>
    <p>"I am sorry," he said; "you are unhappy, and I have intruded upon you; will you forgive me?
     You are thinking of your home, no doubt; you have not had a letter from England for a long
     time."</p>
    <p>Julia wished he did not notice so many things. "I did not expect a letter," she said; "my
     eldest sister was married last week, there would be no time to write to me
     <pb n="68"/> till everything was over; most likely I shall hear to-morrow."</p>
    <p>"Is your sister married?" he asked; "and you were not able to be present?"</p>
    <p>"It is too far to go home from here," Julia said; then asked, "Were you going to the
     barns?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," he answered, suddenly reminded of the fact. Then seeing she did not resume her seat on
     the steps, he ventured diffidently, "Will you come too?"</p>
    <p>She assented, and they started together in silence, Joost thinking her homesick, not knowing
     quite what to say. When they came to the first of the dark buildings they went in, and he swung
     the lantern round so that their shadows danced fantastically. Then he tried various doors, and
     glanced up the wall-ladder to the square opening which led to the floor above. There was no
     need to examine the place minutely, it was all quiet and dark; if there had been any one about
     they would certainly have heard, and if there had been anything smouldering—a danger more to be
     feared, seeing that the men smoked everywhere—it could have been smelt in the dry air.</p>
    <p>"I like these barns," Julia said, looking round: "they are so big and quiet and orderly,
     somehow so respectable."</p>
    <p>"Respectable!" he repeated, as if he did not approve of the word. "Is that what you like? The
     respectable?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, in its place; and its place is here."</p>
    <p>"You think us respectable?"</p>
    <p>"Well, are you not? I think you are the most respectable people in the world."</p>
    <p>She led the way through to the next barn as she spoke. "You are going here, too, I suppose?"
     she said.</p>
    <p>"I will just look round," he answered.</p>
    <p>They went on together until they came to the last barn of all; while they paused there a
     moment they heard a
     <pb n="69"/> rustling and movement in the dark, far corner. Joost started violently, then he
     said, "It is a rat, you must not be afraid; it will not run this way."</p>
    <p>"I am not afraid," Julia said with amusement. "Do you think I am afraid of rats?"</p>
    <p>"Girls often are."</p>
    <p>"Well, I am not," and it was clear from her manner that she spoke the truth.</p>
    <p>"Would you be afraid to come out here alone?" he asked curiously.</p>
    <p>"No," she said; "any night that you like I will come here alone, go through the barns and
     fasten the doors."</p>
    <p>"I do not believe there are many girls who would do that," he said; he was thinking of Denah
     and Anna.</p>
    <p>Julia told him there were plenty who would. As they came back, stopping to fasten each door
     after them, he remarked, "I think girls are usually brought up with too much protection; I mean
     girls of our class, they are too much shielded; one has them for the house only; if they were
     flowers I would call them stove-plants."</p>
    <p>Julia laughed. "You believe in the emancipation of women then?" she said; "you would rather a
     woman could take care of herself, and not be afraid, than be womanly?"</p>
    <p>"No," he answered; "I would like them to be both, as you are."</p>
    <p>They had come outside now; she was standing in the misty moon-light, while he stayed to
     fasten the last door.</p>
    <p>"I?" she said; "you seem to think me a paragon—clever, brave, womanly. Do you know what I
     really am? I am bad; by a long way the wickedest person you have known."</p>
    <p>But he did not believe her, which was perhaps not altogether surprising.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
    <head>DEBTOR AND CREDITOR</head>
    <p>Violet Polkington was married, and, as a consequence, the financial affairs of the family
     were in a state that can only be described as wonderful. They were intricately involved, of
     course, and there was no chance of their being clear again for a year at least; but, also,
     there was no chance of them being found out, appearances were better than ever.</p>
    <p>Mr. Frazer had been given a small living, whether by the deserved kindness of fortune, or by
     reason of his own efforts, or the Polkingtons, is not known. Anyhow he had it, and he and
     Violet were married in June with all necessary <hi>éclat</hi>. Local papers described the event
     in glowing terms, appreciative friends said it was the prettiest wedding in years, and in due
     time Chèrie wrote and told Julia about it. The Captain also wrote; his point of view was rather
     different, but his letter filled up gaps in Chèrie's information, and Julia's own past
     experience filled up the remaining gaps in both.</p>
    <p>The letters came on Tuesday, as Julia expected, a little before dinner time; she was still
     reading them when Mijnheer and his son came in from the office. Joost smiled sympathetically
     when he saw she had them, glad on her account; and she, almost unconsciously, crumpled together
     the sheets that lay on the table beside her, as if she were afraid they would betray their
     contents to him.
     <pb n="71"/></p>
    <p>"You have good news from home?" said Mijnheer; "your parents are well?"</p>
    <p>"Quite well, thank you," Julia answered. She had just come to the place in her father's
     letter where he regretted that such very light refreshments were the fashion at wedding
     receptions. "It is, of course, as your mother says, less expensive, but at such a time who
     would spare expense—if it were the fashion? I assure you I had literally nothing to eat at the
     time, or afterwards; your mother thinking it advisable as soon as we were alone, to put away
     the cakes for future visitors. At such a time, when a man's feelings are nearly touched, he
     needs support; I did not have it, and I cannot say that I have felt myself since."</p>
    <p>Julia read to the end of the letter; Mijnheer had by this time taken up a paper, but Joost
     watched her as she folded the sheets. He did not speak, it seemed he would not intrude upon
     her; there was something dog-like in this sympathy with what was not understood. She felt
     vaguely uncomfortable by reason of it, and spoke to break the spell. "Everything went off very
     well," she said.</p>
    <p>The words were for him alone, since Mijnheer was now reading, and also knew nothing of the
     subject. The smile brightened on his face. "Did it?" he answered. "I am very glad. They must
     have missed you much, and thought often of you."</p>
    <p>Julia nodded. Chèrie had said. "I must say I think it is a pity you were not here; it is
     important to have some one with a head in the background; mother and I had to be the fore, so
     of course we could not do it; if you had been here several things would have gone better, and
     some waste have been saved."</p>
    <p>This remark Julia did not communicate to Joost; she
     <pb n="72"/> put the letter in her pocket, and went to fetch the dinner. After dinner she was
     to go on an errand for Mevrouw. It would take a long time, all the evening in fact, for it was
     to an old relative who lived in a village about three miles from the town. Walking was the only
     way of getting to the place, except twice a week when a little cargo boat went down the canal,
     and took some hours about it. This was neither the day nor the time for the boat, Julia would
     have to walk; but, as she assured Mevrouw, she much preferred it. Accordingly, as soon as
     dinner was finished, she was given a great many messages, mostly of a condoling nature, for the
     old lady was ill in bed, some strengthening soup, and a little bottle of the peach-brandy. With
     these things packed in a substantial marketing basket, she started.</p>
    <p>Through the town she went with that easy step and indifference to the presence of other
     people that Denah so criticised, faster and faster her spirits rising. Once or twice she looked
     in at the low windows that stood open on the shady side of the street; there she saw the heads
     of families smoking their after-dinner pipes, while their wives and daughters sat crocheting
     and watching the passersby. There were chairs with crimson velvet seats in most of the rooms,
     and funny little cabinet, or side-board things of bright red mahogany, with modern Delft vases,
     very blue indeed, upon them. And always there was a certain snugness, perhaps even smugness,
     about the rooms. At least, so it seemed to her as she looked in, almost insolently pleased to
     be outside, to be free and alone.</p>
    <p>In time she came to the outskirts of the town, the canal lay on her right, and on her left,
     flat green fields, cut up by innumerable ditches, and set with frequent windmills, all black
     and white, and mostly used for maintaining the
     <pb n="73"/> water level. There were people busy in the fields, but to Julia they only gave the
     idea of ants, and did not intrude upon her mind in the least. It was all very quiet and green
     around, and quiet and blue above, except for the larks singing rapturously. Certainly it was
     very good to be away from the Van Heigens, away from the ceaseless little reiteration of
     Mevrouw's talk, from the minute, punctilious conventions, from Joost's quiet gaze, from the
     proximity of the hateful, necessary blue daffodil. With a violent rebound Julia shook off the
     feeling that had been growing on her of late, and was once more possibly reckless, but
     certainly free, and no longer under the spell of her surroundings. Her young blood coursed
     quickly, her eyes shone, the basket she carried grew light; she might have sung as she went had
     not Nature, in withholding the ability, also kindly withheld the inclination.</p>
    <p>Soon after leaving the town, a side road cut into the main one; a waggon was lumbering down
     it at no great pace, but just before the branch road joined the main one the driver cracked his
     whip loudly, so that his team of young horses started forward suddenly. Too suddenly for the
     comprehension of some children who were playing in the road; for a second or more they looked
     at the approaching waggon, then, when the necessity dawned upon them, they ran for safety, one
     one way, one another, and the third, a baby boy, like a chicken, half across the way to the
     right, then, after a scurry in the middle, back again to the left, under the horses' feet.</p>
    <p>Julia shouted to him, but in the excitement of the moment she spoke English, and not Dutch,
     though it hardly mattered, for the little boy was far too frightened to understand anything. It
     certainly would have fared badly with him had she not followed up her cry by darting into the
     road, seizing him by the shoulder, and flinging
     <pb n="74"/> him with considerable force against the green wayside bank. She was only just in
     time; as it was, the foremost horse struck her shoulder and sent her rolling into the dust.</p>
    <p>For an instant she lay there, perilously near the big grinding wheels; an almost
     imperceptible space, yet somehow long enough for her to decide quite calmly that it was
     impossible to scramble to her feet in time, so she had better draw her legs up and trust to the
     wheels missing her. Then suddenly the wheels stopped, and some one who had seized the horses'
     heads addressed the waggoner with the English idiom that is perhaps most widely known.</p>
    <p>Julia heard "damned fool" in quite unemotional English, and almost simultaneously the
     guttural shrieks of two peasant women who approached. She picked herself up, then moving two
     paces to the side, stopped to put her hat straight with a calmness she did not quite feel.
     There was a volley of exclamations from the peasant women, and "Are you hurt?" the man who had
     stopped the horses asked her, speaking now in Dutch, though with an English accent.</p>
    <p>"No," she answered, winking back the water which had come into her eyes with the force of the
     blow, and she turned her back on him so that he should not see her do it.</p>
    <p>"My good women," she said shortly to the peasants who, with upraised hands and many gestures,
     stared at her, "there is nothing the matter, there is no reason why you should stand there and
     look at me; I assure you no one has been hurt, and no one is going to be; you had much better
     go on your way, as I shall do. Good-afternoon."</p>
    <p>She walked a few paces down the road, not in the
     <pb n="75"/> direction she intended to go certainly, but she was too shaken for the moment to
     notice which way she took, and was only actuated by a desire to get away and put an end to a
     scene. The movement and the words were not without effect; the two women, a good deal
     astonished, obeyed automatically, and, picking up the burdens they had set down, trudged on
     their way, not realising for some time how much offended they were at the curt behaviour of the
     "mad English." The children by this time had ceased staring and returned to their play; the
     waggoner, muttering some surly words, drove on. Julia sat on the bank by the roadside, and
     tried to brush the dust from her dress. The Englishman, after making some parting remarks to
     the waggoner, this time in Dutch, though still in the quiet, drawling voice which was much at
     variance with the language, had gone to pick up the basket. She wished she had thanked him for
     his timely assistance when she first scrambled to her feet, and gone on at once, then she could
     have done this necessary sitting down when he was out of sight, and come back for the stupid
     basket when she remembered it. But now she would have to thank him formally, and perhaps
     explain things, and say expressly that she was not hurt, and this while she was shaken and
     dusty. Mercifully he was English, and so would not expect much; she looked at his back with
     satisfaction. He was scarcely as tall as many Hollanders, but very differently built. To Julia,
     looking at him rather stupidly, his proportions, like his clothes, appeared very nearly perfect
     after those she had been used to seeing lately. When he turned and she saw for the first time
     his face, she was not very much surprised, though really it was surprising that Rawson-Clew
     should still be hereabouts.</p>
    <p>Their eyes met in mutual recognition. Afterwards she
     <pb n="76"/> wondered why she did not pretend to be Dutch, it ought to have been possible; he
     had only seen her once before, and her knowledge of the language was much better than his. And
     even if he had not been deceived, he would have been bound to acquiesce to her pretence, had
     she persisted in it. But she did not think of it before their mutual recognition had made it
     too late.</p>
    <p>"I hope you are not hurt," he said, as he crossed the road with the basket.</p>
    <p>"No," she answered, "thanks to you—"</p>
    <p>But he, evidently sharing her dislike for a fuss, was even more anxious than she not to dwell
     on that, and dismissed the subject quickly. He began to wipe the bottom of the basket, from
     which soup was dripping, talking the while of the carelessness of continental drivers and the
     silliness of children of all nations, perhaps to give her time to recover.</p>
    <p>She agreed with him, and then repeated her thanks.</p>
    <p>He again set them aside. "It's nothing," he said; "I am glad to have had the opportunity,
     especially since it also gives me the opportunity of offering you some apology for an
     unfortunate misunderstanding which arose when last I saw you. You must feel that it needs an
     apology."</p>
    <p>For a moment Julia's eyes showed her surprise; an apology was not what she expected, and, to
     tell the truth, it did not altogether please her. She knew that she and her father had no right
     to it while the money was unpaid.</p>
    <p>"Please do not apologise," she said; "there is no need, I quite understand."</p>
    <p>"I was labouring under a false impression," Rawson-Clew explained.</p>
    <p>She nodded. "I know," she said, "but it is cleared up
     <pb n="77"/> now; no one who spoke with my father could possibly imagine he lived by his
     wits."</p>
    <p>Which ambiguous remark may have been meant to apply to the Captain's mental outfit more than
     his moral one. When Rawson-Clew knew Julia better he came to the conclusion it probably did, at
     the time he thought it wise not to answer it.</p>
    <p>"Here is your basket," he said; "I think it is clean now."</p>
    <p>She made a movement to take it, but her arm was numb and powerless from the blow she had
     received; it was the right shoulder which had been struck, and that hand was clearly useless
     for the time being; with a wince of pain, she stretched out the left.</p>
    <p>But he drew the basket back. "You are hurt," he said.</p>
    <p>"No, I'm not, nothing to speak of; it only hurts me when I move that arm; I will carry the
     basket with the other hand."</p>
    <p>"How far have you to go?"</p>
    <p>She told him to the village and back.</p>
    <p>"You had better go straight home at once," he said.</p>
    <p>"I can't do that," she answered. She did not explain that she did not want to, the pain in
     her shoulder not being bad enough to make her want to give up this first hour of freedom. "My
     shoulder does not hurt if I do not move it," she said; "I can carry the basket with the other
     hand."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps you will allow me to carry it for you?" he suggested; "I am going the same way."</p>
    <p>"No, thank you," she returned. "Thanks very much for the offer, but there isn't any need; I
     can manage quite well. I expect you will want to go faster than I do." She spoke decidedly, and
     turned about quickly; as she did
     <pb n="78"/> so, she caught sight of the bottle of peach-brandy in the grass.</p>
    <p>"Oh, there's the brandy," she exclaimed; "I mustn't go without that."</p>
    <p>He fetched the fortunately unbroken bottle and put it in the basket, but he did not give it
     to her.</p>
    <p>"I will carry this," he said; "if our pace does not agree, if you would prefer to walk more
     slowly, I will wait for you at the beginning of the village."</p>
    <p>Julia rose to her feet, there was no choice left to her but to acquiesce; from her heart she
     wished he would leave the basket and go alone; she wished even that he would be rude to her,
     she felt that then he would have been nearer her level and her father's. She resented alike his
     presence and his courtesy, and she could not show either feeling, only accept what he offered
     and walk by his side, just as if no money was owed, and no letter, condescendingly cancelling
     the debt, had been written. She grew hot as she thought of that carefully worded letter, and
     hot when she thought of her father's relief thereat. And here, here was the man who must have
     dictated the letter, and probably paid the debt, behaving just as if such things never existed.
     He was walking with her—she could not give him ten yards start and follow him into the
     village—and making polite conversations about the weather, and the road, and the quantity of
     soup that had been spilled.</p>
    <p>She pulled herself together, and, feeling the situation to be beyond remedy, determined to
     bear herself bravely, and carry it off with what credit she could. She glanced at the more than
     half-empty soup can. "I am afraid you are right," she said; "there is a great deal of it gone;
     still, that is not without advantage—I shall be sent to take some more in a day or two."
     <pb n="79"/></p>
    <p>"You wish that?" he inquired.</p>
    <p>"Yes," she answered, "I find the exercise beneficial; I have had too much pudding
     lately."</p>
    <p>He looked politely surprised, and she went on to explain.</p>
    <p>"It is very wholesome," she said, "but a bit stodgy; I think it is too really good to be
     taken in such large quantities by any one like me. It is unbelievably good, it makes one
     perfectly ashamed of oneself; and unbelievably narrow, it makes one long for bed-time."</p>
    <p>She broke off to smile at his more genuine surprise, and her smile, like that of some other
     people of little real beauty, was one of singular charm.</p>
    <p>"Did you think I meant actual pudding?" she asked. "I didn't; I meant just the whole life
     here; if you knew the people well, the real middle class ones, you would understand."</p>
    <p>"I think I can understand without knowing them well," he said; "I fancy there is a good deal
     of pudding about; in fact, I myself am feeling its rather oppressive influence."</p>
    <p>"The town is paved with it," Julia declared. "I thought so this afternoon. I also thought,
     though it is Tuesday, it was just like a spring Sunday; every day is like that."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew suggested that many people appreciated spring Sundays.</p>
    <p>"So do I," Julia agreed, "but in moderation; you can't do your washing on Sunday, nor your
     harvesting in spring. An endless succession of spring Sundays is very awkward when you have
     got—well, week-day work to do, don't you think so?"</p>
    <p>He wondered a little what week-day work she had in her mind, but he did not ask.</p>
    <p>"Are you living with a Dutch family?" he inquired.
     <pb n="80"/></p>
    <p>She nodded. "As companion," she said; "sort of superior general servant."</p>
    <p>"Indeed? Then it must have been you I saw yesterday; I thought so at the time; you were
     driving with some Dutch ladies."</p>
    <p>Julia was surprised that he had seen and recognised her. "We went for an excursion
     yesterday," she said; "they called it a picnic."</p>
    <p>She told him about it, not omitting any of the points which had amused her. Could Joost have
     heard her, he would have felt that his suspicion that she sometimes laughed at them more than
     justified; but she did not give a thought to Joost, and probably would not have paused if she
     had. She wanted to pass the present time, and she was rather reckless how, so long as
     Rawson-Clew either talked himself, or seemed interested in what she said; also, it must be
     admitted, though it was to this man, it was something of a treat to talk freely again. So she
     gave him the best account she could, not only of the excursion, but of other things too. And if
     it was his attention she wanted, she should have been satisfied, for she apparently had it, at
     first only the interest of courtesy, afterwards something more; it even seemed, before the end,
     as if she puzzled him a little, in spite of his years and experience.</p>
    <p>He found himself mentally contrasting the life at the Van Heigens', as she described it, with
     that which he had imagined her to have led at Marbridge, and, now that he talked to her, he
     could not find her exact place in either.</p>
    <p>"You must find Dutch conventionality rather trying," he said at last.</p>
    <p>"I am not used to it yet," she answered; "when I am it will be no worse than the
     conventionality at home."</p>
    <p>He felt he was wrong in one of his surmises; clearly
     <pb n="81"/> she was not really Bohemian. "Surely," he said, "you have not found these absurd
     rules and restrictions in England?"</p>
    <p>"Not the same ones; we study appearances one way, and they do another; but it comes to the
     same thing, so far as I am concerned. One day I hope to be able to give it up and retire; when
     I do I shall wear corduroy breeches and if I happen to be in the kitchen eating onions when
     people come to see me, I shall call them in and offer them a share."</p>
    <p>"Rather an uncomfortable ambition, isn't that?" he inquired. "I am afraid you will have to
     wait some time for its fulfilment, especially the corduroy. I doubt if you will achieve that
     this side the grave, though you might perhaps make a provision in your will to be buried in
     it."</p>
    <p>Julia laughed a little. "You think my family would object? They would; but, you see, I should
     be retiring from them as well as from the world, the corduroy might be part of my
     bulwarks."</p>
    <p>"I don't think you could afford it even for that; do you think women ever can afford that
     kind of disregard for appearances?"</p>
    <p>"Plain ones can," she said; "it is the only compensation they have for being plain; not much,
     certainly, seeing what they lose, but they have it. When you can never look more than
     indifferent, it does not matter how much less you look."</p>
    <p>"That is a rather unusual idea," he remarked; "it appears sound in theory, but in
     practice—"</p>
    <p>"Sounder still," she answered him.</p>
    <p>He laughed. "I'm afraid you won't make many converts here," he said, "where nearly every
     woman is plain, and according to your experience, every one, men and
     <pb n="82"/> women too, think a great deal of looks; at all events, correct ones."</p>
    <p>"They do do that," she admitted; "they just worship propriety and the correct, and have the
     greatest notion of the importance of their neighbours' eyes. It is a perfect treat to be out
     alone, and not have to regard them—this is the first time I have been out alone since I have
     been here."</p>
    <p>"Rather hard; I thought every one had—er—time off."</p>
    <p>"An evening out?" she suggested. "I believe the number of evenings out is regulated by the
     number of applications for the post when vacant; cooks could get more evenings than housemaids,
     and nursery governesses might naturally expect a minus number, if that were possible. There
     would be lots of applications for my post, so I can't expect many evenings; however, I have
     thought of a plan by which I can get out again and again!"</p>
    <p>"What will you do?" he inquired.</p>
    <p>"I shall get Denah—she is one of the girls who went for the excursion—to come and teach
     Mevrouw a new crochet pattern after dinner of a day. It will take ages, Mevrouw learns very
     slowly, and Denah will know better than to hurry matters; she admires Mijnheer Joost, the Van
     Heigens' son, and she will be only too delighted to have an excuse to come to the house."</p>
    <p>"And if she is there you will have a little leisure? Some one always has to be on duty? Is
     that it?"</p>
    <p>Julia laughed softly. "If she is there," she said, "she will want me out of the way, and I am
     not satisfactorily out of the way when I am anywhere on the premises. Not that Mijnheer Joost
     talks to me when I am there, or would talk to her if I were not; she just mistrusts every
     unmarried female by instinct."
     <pb n="83"/></p>
    <p>"A girl's instinct in such matters is not always wrong," Rawson-Clew observed.</p>
    <p>But if he thought Julia had any mischievous propensities of that sort he was mistaken. "I
     should not think of interfering in such an affair," she said; "why, it would be the most
     suitable thing in the world, as suitable as it is for my handsome and able sister to marry the
     ambitious and able nephew of a bishop; they are the two halves that make one whole. Denah and
     Joost would live a perfectly ideal pudding life; he with his flowers—that is his work, you
     know; he cares for nothing besides, really—and she with her housekeeping. He with a little
     music for relaxation, she with her neighbours and accomplishments; it would be as neat and
     complete and suitable as anything could be."</p>
    <p>"And that commends it to you? I should have imagined that what was incongruous and odd
     pleased you better."</p>
    <p>"I like that too," she was obliged to admit, "though best when the people concerned don't see
     the incongruity; but I don't really care either way, whether things are incongruous or
     suitable, I enjoy both, and should never interfere so long as they don't upset my concerns and
     the end in view."</p>
    <p>He looked at her curiously; again it seemed he was at fault; she was not merely a wayward
     girl in revolt against convention, saying what she deemed daring for the sake of saying it, and
     in the effort to be original. She was not posing as a Bohemian any more than she was truly
     one.</p>
    <p>"Have you usually an end in view?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Have not you?" she answered, turning on him for a moment eyes that Joost had described as
     "eating up what they looked at." "Of course," she said, looking away
     <pb n="84"/> again, "it is quite natural, and very possible, that you are here for no purpose,
     and I am here for no purpose too; you might quite well have come to this little town for
     amusement, and I have come for the money I might earn as a companion. Or you might have drifted
     here by accident, as I might, without any special reason—" She stopped as she spoke; they were
     fast approaching the first house of the village now, and she held out her hand for the basket.
     "I will take it," she said; "I have a very short distance to go; thank you so much."</p>
    <p>"Let me carry it the rest of the way," he insisted; "I am going through the village; we may
     as well go the rest of the way together, I want you to tell me—"</p>
    <p>But Julia did not tell him anything, except that her way was by the footpath which turned off
     to the right. "I could not think of troubling you further," she said. "Thank you."</p>
    <p>She put her hand on the basket, so that he was obliged to yield it; then, with another word
     of thanks, she said "good-evening," and started by the path.</p>
    <p>For a moment he looked after her, annoyed and interested against his will; of course, she
     meant nothing by her words about his purpose and her own, still it gave him food for reflection
     about her, and the apparent incongruity of her present surroundings. On the whole, he was glad
     he had met her, partly for the entertainment she had given, and partly for the opportunity he
     had had to apologise.</p>
    <p>An apology was due to her for the affair of last winter, he felt it; though, at the same
     time, he could not hold himself much to blame in the matter. He had gone to Marbridge to see
     into his young cousin's affairs at the request of the boy's widowed mother. The affairs, as
     might have been expected, were in muddle enough, and
     <pb n="85"/> the boy himself was incorrigibly silly and extravagant. The whole business needed
     tact and patience, and in the end had not been very satisfactorily arranged; during the process
     Captain Polkington's name had been mentioned more than once; he figured, among other ways, of
     spending much and getting little in return. Somehow or other Rawson-Clew had got the impression
     that the Captain was—well, perhaps pretty much what he really had come to be; and if that was
     not quite what his wife had persuaded herself and half Marbridge to think him, surely no one
     was to blame. The mistake made was about the Captain's wife and daughters and position in the
     town; Rawson-Clew, in the first instance, never gave them a thought; the Captain was a detached
     person in his mind, and, as such, a possible danger to his cousin's loose cash. He went to No.
     27 to talk plainly to the man, not to tell him he was a shark and an adventurer; it was the
     Captain himself who translated and exaggerated thus; not even to tell him what he thought, that
     he was a worthless old sponge, but to make it plain that things would not go on as they had
     been doing. The girl's interruption had been annoying, so ill-timed and out of place; she ought
     to have gone at once when he suggested it; she had placed him and herself, too, in an
     embarrassing position; yet, at the same time—he saw it now, though he did not earlier—there was
     something quaint in the way she had both metaphorically and actually stood between him and her
     miserable old father. He had dictated the subsequent letter to the Captain more on her account
     than anything else. He considered that by it he was making her the amend honourable for the
     unfortunate interview of the afternoon, as well as closing the incident. Of course, nothing
     real was forfeited by the letter, for under no circumstances would the money have been repaid; he
     <pb n="86"/> never had any delusion about that. From which it appears that his opinion of the
     Captain had not changed.</p>
    <p>As for his opinion of Julia, he had not one when he first saw her, except that she had no
     business to be there; now, however, he felt some little interest in her. There was very little
     that was interesting in this small Dutch town; it was a refreshing change, he admitted it to
     himself, to see a girl here who put her clothes on properly; something of a change to meet one
     anywhere who did not at once fall into one of the well-defined categories.</p>
    <p>Much in this world has to be lain at the door of opportunity, and idleness in youth, and
      <hi>ennui</hi> and boredom in middle ages. Rawson-Clew was in the borderland between the two,
     and did not consider himself open to the temptations of either. He was not idle, he had things
     to do; and he was not bored, he had things to think about; but not enough of either to prevent
     him from having a wide margin.</p>
    <p>When he met Julia again there was no reason for dropping the acquaintance renewed through
     necessity. But also there was no opportunity, on that occasion, for pushing it further, even if
     there had been inclination, for she was not alone.</p>
    <p>It was on Saturday evening; she was walking down the same road, much about the same time, but
     there was with her a tall, fair young man, with a long face and loose limbs. He carried, of
     course, an umbrella—that was part of his full dress—and the basket—he walked between her and
     the cart track. She bowed sedately to Rawson-Clew, and the young man, becoming tardily aware of
     it, took off his hat, rather late, and with a sweeping foreign flourish. She wore a pair of
     cotton gloves, and lifted her dress a few inches, and glanced shyly up at her escort now and
     then as he talked. They were speaking Dutch, and
     <pb n="87"/> she was behaving Dutch, as plain and demure a person as it was possible to
     imagine, until she looked back, then Rawson-Clew saw a very devil of mockery and mischief flash
     up in her eyes. Only for a second; the expression was gone before her head was turned again,
     and that was decorously soon. But it had been there; it was like the momentary parting of the
     clouds on a grey day; it illumined her whole face—her mind, too, perhaps—as the eerie, tricky
     gleam, which is gone before a man knows it, lights up the level landscape, and transforms it to
     something new and strange.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew walked on ahead of the pair; he had to outpace them, since he was bound the same
     way, and could not walk with them. He was not sure that he was not rather sorry for Denah, the
     Dutch girl; one who can laugh at herself as well as another, and all alone, too, is he thought,
     rather apt to enjoy the incongruous more than the suitable.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
    <head>HOW JULIA DID NOT GET THE BLUE DAFFODIL</head>
    <p>Vrouw Van Heigen was learning a new crochet pattern; one did it in thread of a Sèvres blue
     shade; when several long strips were made, one sewed them together with pieces of black satin
     between each two, and there was an antimacassar of severe but rich beauty. Denah explained all
     this as she set Mevrouw to work on the pattern; it was very intricate, quite exciting, because
     it was so difficult; the more excited the old lady became the more mistakes she made, but it
     did not matter; Denah was patience itself, and did not seem to mind how much time she gave. She
     came every day after dinner (that is to say, about six o'clock), and when she came it was
     frequently found necessary that Julia should go to inquire after the invalid cousin. Denah
     thought herself the deepest and most diplomatic young woman in Holland; she even found it in
     her heart to pity Julia, the poor companion, who she used as a pawn in her romance. The which,
     since it was transparently obvious to the pawn, gave her vast, though private, delight.</p>
    <p>So Julia went almost daily down the long flat road to the village, and very often Rawson-Clew
     had to go that way too; and when he did, his time of going being of necessity much the same
     time as hers, he was almost bound to walk with her. There was but one way to the place; they
     must either walk together in the middle of the
     <pb n="89"/> road, or else separately, one side of it; and seeing that they were of the same
     nationality, in a foreign land, and had some previous acquaintance, it would have been nothing
     short of absurd to have done the latter. So as often as they met they walked together and
     talked of many things, and in the course of time Rawson-Clew came to find Julia's company a
     good deal more entertaining than his own; although she had read nothing she ought to have read,
     seen nothing she ought to have seen, and occasionally both thought and said things she
     certainly ought not, and was not even conventionally unconventional.</p>
    <p>They usually parted at the footpath, which shortened her way a little, Rawson-Clew giving her
     the basket there, and going down the road alone; in consequence of this it was some time before
     she knew for certain where it was he went, although she had early guessed. But one damp evening
     she departed from her usual custom. It had been raining heavily all day, and although it had
     cleared now, a thick mist lay over the wet fields.</p>
    <p>"I shall have to go round by the road," she said, as she looked at the track.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew agreed with her. "I am rather surprised that you came out at all this evening,"
     he remarked. "I should have thought your careful friends would have been afraid of colds and
     wet feet."</p>
    <p>"Vrouw Van Heigen was," Julia answered, "but Denah and I were not. It is the last opportunity
     we shall have for a little while; Joost goes to Germany on business to-morrow."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew laughed. "Which means, I suppose," he said, "that she will neglect the crochet
     work, and you will have to superintend it? Not very congenial to you, is it?"</p>
    <p>"Good discipline," she told him.
     <pb n="90"/></p>
    <p>"And for that reason to be welcomed? Really you deserve to succeed in whatever it is you are
     attempting; you do not neglect details."</p>
    <p>"Details are often important," she said; "stopping at home and doing crochet work while Joost
     is in Germany, for instance, may help me a good deal."</p>
    <p>The tone struck Rawson-Clew as implying more than the words said, but he did not ask for an
     interpretation, and before long she had put a question to him. They were nearing a large house
     that stood far back from the road on the left hand side. It was a big block of a place,
     greyish-white in colour, and with more than half of its windows bricked up, indescribably
     gloomy. A long, straight piece of water lay before it, stretching almost from the walls to the
     road, from which it was separated by a low fence. Tall, thick trees grew in a close row on
     either side, narrowing the prospect; a path ran up beside them on the one hand, the only way to
     the house, but in the steamy mist which lay thick over everything this evening one could hardly
     see it, and it looked as if the place were unapproachable from the front.</p>
    <p>Julia glanced curiously towards the house; it was the only one of any size or possible
     interest in the village; the only one, she had decided some time ago, that Rawson-Clew could
     have any reason to visit.</p>
    <p>As they approached the gate she ventured, "You go here, do you not?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," he answered; "to Herr Van de Greutz."</p>
    <p>"The cousin tells me he is a great chemist," Julia said.</p>
    <p>"He is," Rawson-Clew agreed, "and one much absorbed in his work; it is impossible to see him
     even on business except in the evening."</p>
    <p>He paused by the gate as he spoke. "You have not much further to go, have you?" he said.
     "Will you ex
     <pb n="91"/>cuse me carrying your basket further? I am afraid I am rather behind my time."</p>
    <p>Julia took the basket, assuring him she had no distance to carry it, but her eyes as she said
     it twinkled with amusement; it was not really late, and she knew it.</p>
    <p>"You are afraid of what will be said next," she thought as she looked back at the man, who
     was already vanishing among the mists by the lake. And the thought pleased her somewhat, for it
     suggested that Rawson-Clew had a respect for her acumen, and also that her private fancy—that
     the business which brought him here was not of a kind for public discussion—was correct.</p>
    <p>The cousin was better that evening; she even expressed hopes of living through the summer, a
     thing she had not done for more than three days. Julia cheered and encouraged her in this
     belief (which, indeed, there was every reason to think well founded) and gave her the messages
     and dainties she had brought. After that they talked of the weather, which was bad; and the
     neighbours, who, on the whole, were good. Julia knew most of them by name by this time—the kind
     old Padre and his wife; the captain of the little cargo-boat, who drank a little, and his
     generous wife, who talked a great deal; the fat woman who kept fowls, and the thin one who
     sometimes stole the eggs. Julia had heard all about them before, but she heard over again, and
     a little about the great chemist, Herr Van de Greutz, too.</p>
    <p>This great man was naturally only a name to the invalid and her friends, but they had always
     plenty to say about him. He was so distinguished that all the village felt proud to have him
     live on their borders, and so disagreeable that they were decidedly in awe of him. Of his
     domestic arrangements there was always talk; he lived in his great gloomy house with an old
     housekeeper, whom
     <pb n="92"/> Julia knew by sight, and a young cook, whom she did not; the former was a
     permanency, the latter very much the reverse, it being difficult to find a cook equal to his
     demands who would for any length of time endure the shortness of the housekeeper's temper, and
     the worse one of her master. The domestic affairs of the chemist were a favourite subject of
     gossip, but sometimes his attainments came in for mention too; they did to-night, the cousin
     being in a garrulous mood. According to her, the great man had done everything in science worth
     mentioning, and was not only the first chemist in Holland, but in all the world; he looked down
     on all others, she said, regarding two Germans only as anything approaching his peers, all the
     English and French being nothing to him. He had discovered a great many things, dyes, poisons,
     and explosives; of the last he had recently perfected one which was twenty-two times stronger
     than anything before known. Its nature was, of course, a secret, but it would eventually raise
     the little army of Holland far above those of all other nations.</p>
    <p>Julia listened, but especially to the last piece of information, which struck her as being
     the one most likely to prove interesting. Soon after hearing it, however, she was obliged to
     go. She made her farewells, and received messages of affection for Mevrouw, condolence for
     Mijnheer—who had a cold—and good wishes for Joost's journey. Then she started homewards, with a
     light basket and a busy mind.</p>
    <p>It did not take her very long to decide that if there was any truth in this talk of Van de
     Greutz's achievements, it must be the last mentioned—the explosive—which brought Rawson-Clew
     here. Her judgment of men, for working purposes at least, was quick and fairly accurate,
     necessity and experience had helped Nature to make it so.
     <pb n="93"/> There were one or two things in connection with Rawson-Clew which were very clear
     to her, he was not a scientist pure and simple; she had never met one, but she knew he was not
     one, and so was not likely to be interested in the great chemist for chemistry only. Nor was he
     a commercial man; neither his instincts nor his abilities lay in that direction; it was not a
     new process, not a trade secret which brought him here. Indeed, even though he might appreciate
     the value of such things, he would never dream of trying to possess himself of them.</p>
    <p>Julia understood perfectly the scale in which such acts stood to men like Rawson-Clew. To
     attempt to master a man's discovery for one's own ends (as in a way she was doing) was
     impossible, rank dishonesty, never even contemplated; to do it for business purposes—well, he
     might admit it was sometimes necessary in business—commerce had its morality as law, and the
     army had theirs—but it was not a thing he would ever do himself, he would not feel it exactly
     honourable. But to attempt to gain a secret for national use was quite another thing, not only
     justifiable but right, more especially if, as was probably the case, the attempt was in
     fulfilment of a direct order. If after Herr Van de Greutz had a secret worth anything to
     England, it was that which had brought Rawson-Clew to the little town. She was as sure of it as
     she was that it was the blue daffodil which had brought her.</p>
    <p>The hateful blue daffodil! Daily, to possess it grew more imperative. The intercourse with
     this man, the curious seeming equality that was being established between them, cried aloud for
     the paying of the debt, and the establishing of the reality of equality. She longed almost
     passionately to be able to regard herself, to know that the man had reason to regard her, as
     his equal. And yet to possess the thing seemed daily more difficult; more
     <pb n="94"/> and more plainly did she see that bribery, persuasion, cajolery were alike
     useless. The precious bulb could be got in one way, and one only; it would never fall into her
     hands by skilful accident, or nicely stimulated generosity; she must take it, or she must do
     without it. She must get it for herself as deliberately as, in all probability, Rawson-Clew
     meant to get Herr Van de Greutz's secret.</p>
    <p>She raised her head and looked at the flat, wet landscape with unseeing eyes that were
     contemptuous. How different two not dissimilar acts could be made to look! If she took the
     daffodil—and she would have unique opportunity to try during the next two days—Rawson-Clew
     would regard her as little better than a common thief; that is, if he happened to know about
     it. She winced a little as she thought of the faint expression of surprise the knowledge would
     call up in his impassive face and cold grey eyes. She could well imagine the slight difference
     in his manner to her afterwards, scarcely noticeable to the casual observer, impossible to be
     overlooked by her. She told herself she did not care what he thought; but she did. Pride was
     grasping at a desired, but impossible, equality with this man, and here, were the means used
     only known, was the nearest way to lose it. At times he had forgotten the gap of age and
     circumstances between them—really forgotten it, she knew, not only ignored it in his well-bred
     way. He had for a moment really regarded her as an equal; not, perhaps, as he might the women
     of his class, rather the men of like experience and attainments with himself. That was not what
     she wanted, but she recognised plainly that in grasping at a shadowy social feminine equality
     by paying the debt, she might well lose this small substance of masculine equality, for there
     is no gulf so unbridgeable between man and man as a different standard of honour.
     <pb n="95"/></p>
    <p>But after all, she asked herself, what did it matter? He need not know; she would pay,
     fulfilling her word, and proving her father an honest man (which he was not); the debtor could
     not know how it was done. And if he did, what then? If she told him herself—he would know no
     other way—she would do it deliberately with the set purpose of tarring him with the same brush;
     she would show him how his attempt on Herr Van de Greutz might also be made to look. He would
     not be convinced, of course, but at bottom the two things were so related that it would be
     surprising if she did not get a few shafts home. He would not show the wounds then, but they
     would be there; they would rankle; there would be some humiliation for him, too. A curious
     light crept into her eyes at the thought; she was surer of being able to reduce him than of
     exalting herself, and it is good, when circumstances prevent one from mounting, to drag a
     superior to the level of one's humiliation. For a moment she understood something of the
     feelings of the brute mob that throws mud.</p>
    <p>By this time she had reached the town, though almost without knowing it; so deep was she in
     her thoughts that she did not see Joost coming towards her. He had been to escort Denah, who
     had thoughtfully forgotten to provide herself with a cloak; he was now coming back, carrying
     the wrap his mother had lent her.</p>
    <p>Julia started when she became aware of him just in front of her. She was not pleased to see
     him; she had no room for him in her mind just then; he seemed incongruous and out of place. She
     even looked at him a little suspiciously, as if she were afraid the fermenting thoughts in her
     brain might make themselves felt by him.</p>
    <p>He turned and walked beside her. "I have been to take
     <pb n="96"/>home Miss Denah," he explained. "I saw you a long way off, and thought perhaps I
     might escort you; but you are angry; I am sorry."</p>
    <p>Julia could not forbear smiling at him. "I am not angry," she said, as she would to a child;
     "I was only thinking."</p>
    <p>"Of something unpleasant, then, that makes you angry?"</p>
    <p>"No; of something that must have been enjoyable. I was thinking how, in the French
     Revolution, the women of the people must have enjoyed throwing mud at the women of the
     aristocrats; how they must have liked scratching the paint and the skin from their faces, and
     tearing their hair down, and their clothes off."</p>
    <p>Joost stared in amazement. "Do you call that not unpleasant?" he said. "It is the most
     grievous, the most pitiable thing in all the world."</p>
    <p>"For the aristocrats, yes," Julia agreed; "but for the others? Can you not imagine how they
     must have revelled in it?"</p>
    <p>Joost could not; he could not imagine anything violent or terrible, and Julia went on to ask
     him another question, which, however, she answered herself.</p>
    <p>"Do you know why the women of the people did it? It was not only because the others had food
     and they had not; I think it was more because the aristocrats had a thousand other things that
     they had not, and could never have—feelings, instincts, pleasures, traditions—which they could
     not have had or enjoyed even if they had been put in palaces and dressed like queens. It was
     the fact that they could never, never rise to them, that helped to make them so furious to pull
     all down."</p>
    <p>There was a sincerity of conviction in her tone, but Joost only said, "You cannot enjoy to
     think of such
     <pb n="97"/> things; it is horrible and pitiable to remember that human creatures became so
     like beasts."</p>
    <p>Julia's mood altered. "Pitiable, yes; perhaps you are right. After all, we are pitiful
     creatures, and, under the thin veneer, like enough to the beasts." Then she changed the subject
     abruptly, and began to talk of his flowers.</p>
    <p>But he was not satisfied with the change; instinctively he felt she was talking to his level.
     "Why do you always speak to me of bulbs and plants?" he said. "Do you think I am interested in
     nothing else?"</p>
    <p>"No," she said; "I speak of them because I am interested. Do you not believe me? It is quite
     true; you yourself have said that I should make a good florist; already I have learnt a great
     deal, although I have not been here long, and knew nothing before I came."</p>
    <p>"That is so," he admitted; "you are very clever. Nevertheless, I do not think, if you were
     alone now, you would be thinking of plants. You were not when I met you; it was the Revolution,
     or, perhaps, human nature—you called it the Revolution in a parable, as you often do when you
     speak your thoughts."</p>
    <p>"Why do you trouble about my thoughts?" Julia said, impatiently. "How do you know what I
     think?"</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I don't," he answered; "only sometimes it seems to me your voice tells me though
     your words do not."</p>
    <p>"My voice?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; it is full of notes like a violin, and speaks more than words. I suppose all voices
     have many notes really, but people do not often use them; they use only a few. You use many;
     that is why I like to listen to you when you talk to my parents, or any one. It is like a
     master playing on an instrument; you make simple words mean much, more than I understand
     sometimes; you can caress
     <pb n="98"/> and you can laugh with your voice; I have heard you do it when I have not been
     able to understand what you caress, or at what you laugh, any more than an ignorant person can
     understand what the violin says, although he may enjoy to hear it. To-night you do not caress
     or laugh; there is something black in your thoughts."</p>
    <p>"That is human nature, as you say," Julia said shortly, ignoring the comment on her voice.
     "Human nature is a hateful, ugly thing; there is no use in thinking about it."</p>
    <p>"It has certainly fallen," Joost allowed; "but I have sometimes thought perhaps, if it were
     not so, it would be a little—a very little—monotonous."</p>
    <p>"You would not find it dull," Julia told him. "I believe you would not have got on very well
     in the Garden of Eden, except that, since all the herbs grew after their own kind, there would
     be no opportunity to hybridise them."</p>
    <p>But the mystery of production and generation, even in the vegetable world, was not a subject
     that modesty permitted Joost to discuss with a girl. His manner showed it, to her impatient
     annoyance, as he hastily introduced another aspect of man's first estate. "If we were not
     fallen," he added, "we should have no opportunity to rise. That, indeed, would be a loss; is it
     not the struggle which makes the grand and fine characters which we admire?"</p>
    <p>"I don't admire them," Julia returned; "I admire the people who are born good, because they
     are a miracle."</p>
    <p>He stopped to unfasten the gate; it did not occur to him that she was thinking of
     himself.</p>
    <p>"I cannot agree with you," he said, as they went up the drive together. "Rather, I admire
     those who have fought temptation, who are strong, who know and understand and have conquered;
     they inspire me to try and follow.
     <pb n="99"/> What inspiration is there in the other? Consider Miss Denah, for an example; she
     has perhaps never wanted to do more wrong than to take her mother's prunes, but is there
     inspiration in her? She is as soft and as kind as a feather pillow, and as inspiring. But
     you—you told me once you were bad; I did not believe you; I did not understand, but now I know
     your meaning. You have it in your power to be bad or to be good; you know which is which, for
     you have seen badness, and know it as men who live see it. You have fought with it and
     conquered; you have struggled, you do struggle, you have strength in you. That is why you are
     like a lantern that is sometimes bright and sometimes dim, but always a beacon."</p>
    <p>"I am nothing of the sort," Julia said sharply. They were in the dense shadow of the trees,
     so he could not see her face, but her voice sounded strange to him. "You do not know what you
     are talking about," she said; "hardly in my life have I asked myself if a thing is right or
     wrong—do you understand me? Right and wrong are not things I think about."</p>
    <p>"It is quite likely," he said, serenely; "different persons have different names for the same
     things, as you have once said; one calls it 'honourable' and 'dishonourable,' and another
     'right' and 'wrong,' and another 'wise' and 'unwise.' But it is always the same thing; it means
     to choose the more difficult path that leads to the greater end, and leave the other way to the
     lesser and smaller souls."</p>
    <p>Julia caught her breath with a little gasping choke. Joost turned and looked at her, puzzled
     at last; but though they had now reached the house, and the lamplight shone on her, he could
     make out nothing; she brushed past him and went in quickly.</p>
    <p>The next day Joost started for Germany. It rained
     <pb n="100"/> more or less all day, and Julia did not go out, except for half-an-hour during
     the morning, when she was obliged to go marketing. She met Denah bound on the same errand, and
     heard from her, what she knew already, that she would not be able to come and superintend the
     crochet that day. And being in a black and reckless mood, she had the effrontery to laugh a
     silent, comprehending little laugh in the face of the Dutch girl's elaborate explanations.
     Denah was a good deal annoyed, and, though her self-esteem did not allow her to realise the
     full meaning of the offence, she did not forget it.</p>
    <p>Julia went home with her purchases, and spent the rest of the day in the usual small
     occupations. It was an interminably long day she found. She contrived to hide her feelings,
     however, and behaved beautifully, giving the suitable attention and suitable answers to all
     Mevrouw's little remarks about the weather, and Joost's wet journey (though, since he was in
     the train, Julia could not see that the wet mattered to him), and about Mijnheer's cold, which
     was very bad indeed.</p>
    <p>The day wore on. Julia missed Joost's presence at meals; they were not in the habit of
     talking much to each other at such times, it is true, but she always knew when she talked to
     his parents that he was listening, and putting another and fuller interpretation on her words.
     That was stimulating and pleasant too; it was a new form of intercourse, and she did not
     pretend she did not enjoy it for itself, as well as for the opportunity it gave her of probing
     his mind and trying different ideas on him.</p>
    <p>At last dinner was over, and tea; the tea things were washed, and the long-neglected fancy
     work brought out. A clock in the passage struck the hour when, of late, after an exhilirating
     verbal skirmish with the anxious Denah, she had set out for the village and Rawson-Clew.
     <pb n="101"/></p>
    <p>She did not pretend to herself that she did not enjoy that too, she did immensely; there was
     a breath from the outside world in it; there was sometimes the inspiring clash of wits, of
     steel on steel, always the charm of educated intercourse and quick comprehension. To-night
     there was nothing; no exercise to stir the blood, no solitude to stimulate the imagination, no
     effort of talk or understanding to rouse the mind. Nothing but to sit at work, giving
     one-eighth of attention to talk with Mevrouw—more was not needed, and the rest to the blue
     daffodils that lay securely locked up in a place only too well known.</p>
    <p>Evening darkened, grey and dripping, to-night, supper-getting time came, and the hour for
     locking up the barns. Mijnheer, snuffling and wheezing a good deal, put on a coat, a
     mackintosh, a comforter, a pair of boots and a pair of galoshes; took an umbrella, the lantern,
     a great bunch of keys, and went out. Julia watched him go, and said nothing; she had been the
     rounds a good many times with Joost now; the family had talked about it more than once, and
     about her bravery with regard to rats and robbers. Neither of the old people would have been
     surprised if she had volunteered to go in place of Mijnheer, even if his cold had not offered a
     reason for such a thing. But she did not do it; he went alone, and the blue daffodil bulbs lay
     snug in their locked place.</p>
    <p>The next day it still rained, but a good deal harder. There was a sudden drop in the
     temperature, too, such as one often finds in an English summer. The Van Heigens did not have a
     fire on that account, their stoves always kept a four months' sabbath; the advent of a
     snow-storm in July would not have been allowed to break it. Mijnheer's cold was decidedly
     worse; towards evening it grew very bad. He came in early from the office, and sat and shivered
     in the sitting-room with Julia and his
     <pb n="102"/> wife, who was continuing the crochet unaided, and so laying up much future work
     for Denah. At last it was considered dark enough for the lamp to be lighted. Julia got up and
     lit it, and drew the blind, shutting out the grey sheet of the canal and the slanting rain.</p>
    <p>"Dear me," Mevrouw said once again, "how bad the rain must be for Joost!"</p>
    <p>Julia agreed, but reminded her—also once again—that it was possibly not raining in
     Germany.</p>
    <p>Mijnheer looked up from his paper to remark that the weather was very bad for the crops.</p>
    <p>"It is bad for every one," his wife rejoined; "but worse of all for you. You should be in
     bed. Indeed, it is not fit that you should be up; the house is like a cellar this evening."</p>
    <p>Mijnheer did not suggest the remedy of a fire; he, too, shared the belief that stoves should
     not be lighted before the appointed time; he only protested at the idea of bed. "Pooh!" he
     said. "Make myself an invalid with Joost away! Will you go and nurse my nose, and put plasters
     on my chest? Go to bed now, do you say? No, no, my dear, I will sit here; I am comfortable
     enough; I read my paper, I smoke my cigar; by and by, I go out to see that my barns are all
     safe for the night."</p>
    <p>But at this Mevrouw gave an exclamation; the idea of his going out in such weather was
     terrible, she said, and she said it a good many times.</p>
    <p>Julia bent over her work; she heard the swish of the rain on the window, the uneven sob of
     the fitful wind; she heard the old people talk, the husband persist, the wife protest. She did
     not look up; her eyes were fixed on her needle, but she hardly saw it; more plainly she saw the
     dark barns, the crowded shelves, the place where
     <pb n="103"/>the blue daffodils were. She could find them with perfect ease; could choose one
     in the dark as easily as Mijnheer himself; she could substitute for it another, one of the
     common sort of the same shape and size; no one would be the wiser; even when it bloomed, with
     the simple yellow flower that has beautified spring woods so long, no one would know it was not
     a sport of nature, a throw back to the original parent. It was the simplest thing in all the
     world; the safest. Not that that recommended it; she would rather it had been difficult or
     dangerous, it would have savoured more of a fair fight and less of trickery. Besides, such
     safety was nothing; anything can be made safe with care and forethought.</p>
    <p>She caught her own name in the talk now; husband and wife were speaking lower, evidently
     arguing as to the propriety of asking her to go the rounds; for a moment she pretended not to
     hear, then she raised her head, contempt for her own weakness in her mind. It is not
     opportunity that makes thieves of thinking folk, and she knew it; rather it is the thief that
     makes opportunity, if he is up to his work. Why should she be afraid to go to the barns? She
     would not take the daffodil the more for going; if she meant to do it, and, through cowardice,
     let this opportunity slip, she would soon find another. And if she did not mean to, the
     proximity of the thing would not make her take it.</p>
    <p>She put down her work. "I will lock up for you, Mijnheer; give me the keys."</p>
    <p>He protested, and his wife protested, much more feebly, and thanked her for going the while.
     They gave her many directions, and told her she must put on this, that, and the other, and must
     be careful not to get her feet wet, and really need not to be too particular in examining all
     the doors. She answered them with impatient politeness, as one does who is waiting for the
     advent of a greater
     <pb n="104"/> matter; she was not irritated by the trivial interruptions which came between her
     and the decision which was yet to be made; it was somehow so great to her that it seemed as if
     it could wait. At last she was off, Mijnheer's galoshes wallowing about her feet, his
     black-caped mackintosh thrown round her shoulders. She had neither hat nor umbrella. Mevrouw
     literally wailed when she started; but it made no impression, she came of the nation most
     indifferent to getting wet, and most-susceptible to death by consumption of any in Europe.</p>
    <p>She slopped along in the great galoshes, her back to the lighted house now, her face to the
     dark barns. There they were, easily accessible, waiting for her. Was she to take one, or was
     she not? She did not give herself any excuse for taking it, or tell herself that one out of six
     was not much; or that Joost, could he know the case, would not have grudged her one of his
     precious bulbs. There was only one thing she admitted—it was there, and her need for it was
     great. With it she could pay a debt that was due, show her father an honourable man, and,
     seeing that the affair could always remain secret, raise herself nearer to Rawson-Clew's level.
     Without it she could not.</p>
    <p>She had come to the first barn now, and, unbarring the door, went in. Almost oppressive came
     the dry smell of the bulbs to her; very familiar, too, as familiar as the distorted shadows
     that her lantern made. Together they brought vividly to her mind the first time she went the
     rounds with Joost—the night when she told him she was bad, the worst person he knew. Poor
     Joost, he had interpreted her words his own way; she remembered very plainly what he said but
     two nights ago—right and wrong, honourable and dishonourable, wise and unwise, they meant the
     same thing to different people, the choosing
     <pb n="105"/> of the higher, the leaving of the lower—and he believed no less of her. That
     belief, surely, was a thing that fought on the side of the angels? And then there was that
     other man, able, well-bred, intellectual, her superior, who had treated her as an equal, and so
     tacitly demanded that she should conform to his code of honour. And there was Johnny Gillat,
     poor, old round-faced Johnny, who, under his silly, shabby exterior, had somewhere, quite
     understood, the same code, and standard of a gentleman, and never doubted but that she had it
     too—surely these two, also, were on the side of the angels?</p>
    <p>But it was not a matter of angels, neither was it a matter of this man's thought, or that. At
     bottom, it seemed all questions could be brought to plain terms—What do I think? I, alone in
     the big, black, contradictory world. Julia realised it, and asked herself what it mattered if
     he, if they, if all the world called it wrong? What—pitiless, logical question—was wrong? Why
     should to take in one case be so called, and in another not? By whose word, and by what law was
     a thing thus, and why was she to submit to it?</p>
    <p>She faced the darkness, the lantern at her feet, her back against the shelves, and asked
     herself the world-old question; and, like many before her, found no answer, because logic,
     merciless solvent of faith and hope and law, never answers its own riddles. Only, as she stood
     there, there rose up before her mind's eye the face of Joost, with its simple gravity, its
     earnest, trusting blue eyes. She saw it, and she saw the humble dignity with which he had shown
     her his six bulbs. Not as a proud possessor shows a treasure, rather as an adept shares some
     secret of his faith or art; so had he placed them in her power, given her a chance to so use
     this trust. She almost groaned aloud as she recalled him, and recalled, sorely against her
     <pb n="106"/> will, a horrible tale she had once read, of a Brahmin who murdered a little child
     for her worthless silver anklets. Joost was a veritable child to her, powerless before her
     ability, trusting in her good faith, a child indeed, even if he had not placed his secret in
     her grasp. And it was he—this child—that she, with her superior strength, was going to rob!</p>
    <p>She shivered. Why was he not Rawson-Clew? Why could not he take better care of himself and
     his possessions? She could have done it with a light heart then; there would have been a
     semblance of fight in it; but now—now it could not be done. Logic, the pitiless solvent, has no
     action on those old long-transmitted instincts; it may argue with, but it cannot destroy, those
     vague yearnings of the natural man towards righteousness. Julia did not argue, she only obeyed;
     she did not know why.</p>
    <p>She picked up the lantern, and moved to go; as she did so, the barn door, lightly fastened,
     blew open. A rush of rain and wind swept in, the smell of the wet earth, and the sight of the
     tossing trees, and massed clouds that fled across the sky. For a moment she stood and looked,
     hearing the wild night voices, the sob of the wet wind, the rustle and mutter of the
     trees—those primitive inarticulate things that do not lie. And in her heart she felt very weary
     of shams and pretences, very hungry for the rest of reality and truth. She turned away, and
     made the round of the barns systematically, and without haste; she did not hurry past the
     resting-place of the blue daffodils, they were safe from her now and always.</p>
    <p>It was not till some weeks later that she saw, and not then without also seeing it was quite
     impossible to disprove the proposition, that there was something grimly absurd in the idea
     which had possessed her that night—the thought of stealing to prove a lie, and acting dis
     <pb n="107"/>honourably to pay a debt of honour. At the time she did not think at all, she
     acted on instinct only. Thank God for those dumb instincts, making for righteousness, which, in
     spite of theologians, are implanted somewhere in the heart of man.</p>
    <p>So she went the rounds, fastened the barns, and came out of the last one, locking the door
     after her. Outside, she stood a second, the rain falling upon her bare head, the wind blowing
     her cloak about her. And she did not feel triumphant or victorious, nor reluctant and
     contemptuous of her weakness; only somehow apart and alone, and very, very tired.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
    <head>POOFERCHJES AND JEALOUSY</head>
    <p>The Polkingtons were launching out; not ostentatiously with expensive entertainments or
     anything striking, but in all small ways, scarcely noticeable except in general effect, but
     none the less expensive. They could not afford it; the past nine months had been very
     difficult, first the Captain's unfortunate misuse of the cheque, then Violet's engagement and
     the necessary entertainment that it involved, and then her wedding. Financially they were in a
     very bad way, but that did not prevent them spending—or owing—in a rather lordly fashion. Mrs.
     Polkington with one daughter married, and another safely out of the way, seemed determined to
     take the field well with the remaining one. Chèrie was quite ready to second the effort,
     indeed, she was the instigator; she was not only the prettiest of the sisters, but also the
     most ease loving, and though ambitious, less clever than the others, and a great deal more
     short-sighted. She had for some time ceased to be content with the position at Marbridge and
     the society there; she wanted to be recognised by the "county." This desire had been growing of
     late, for there had been a very eligible and attractive bachelor addition to that charmed
     circle, and he had more than once looked admiration her way. She and her mother went to work
     well and spared neither time nor trouble; not much result could be expected during the summer
     months, little done
     <pb n="109"/> then except get ready—an expensive proceeding. It was when September brought
     people home for the partridge shooting and October's pheasants kept them there till hunting
     began, that they expected their success and the return for their outlay, and they were quite
     content to wait for it.</p>
    <p>Their plans and doings were naturally not confided to any one, not even Julia; she heard
     seldom from Marbridge; the family feelings were of a somewhat utilitarian order, based largely
     on mutual benefit. She wrote now and then; she happened to do so on the day after the one on
     which she did not take the blue daffodil; and she mentioned in this letter that it was possible
     she should be home again soon. Seeing that she had decided the daffodil was unobtainable she
     saw little reason for staying longer; this of course she did not mention when she wrote.
     Somewhat to her surprise she got an almost immediate reply to her letter.</p>
    <p>It would not suit Mrs. Polkington and Chèrie to have Julia back soon at all; it is always
     easier to swim socially with one daughter than two, especially if the second is not
     good-looking. Also, Julia, cautious, long-headed and capable, was certain to criticise their
     proceedings and do her best to interfere with them. She would be wrong in her judgments, of
     course, and they right; they were sure of that, but they did not want the trouble of attempting
     to convert her, and anyhow, they felt they could do much better without her, and Mrs.
     Polkington wrote and intimated as much politely. She gave several excellent reasons, all of
     which were perfectly transparent to Julia, though that did not matter, seeing that she was
     sufficiently hurt in her feelings, or her pride, to at once determine to fulfil her mother's
     wishes and do anything rather than go where she was not wanted.
     <pb n="110"/></p>
    <p>There was not much said of the plans and doings in Mrs. Polkington's letter, but a little
     crept in almost without the writer's knowledge, enough to rouse Julia's suspicions. Why, she
     asked herself, was her mother suddenly enamoured with the beauty of Chippendale furniture? How
     did she know that Sturt's (the tailor's) prices were lower for costumes this season? And in
     what way had she become aware what the Ashton's last parlour-maid thought, if she had not
     engaged that young woman for her own service? Julia was at once uneasy and disgusted; the last
     alike with the proceedings themselves and the attempt to deceive her about them. And another
     letter she received at the same time did not make her any more satisfied; it was from Johnny
     Gillat, about as silly and uninforming a letter as ever man wrote, but it contained one piece
     of information. Mr. Gillat was going to have a great excitement in the early autumn—Captain
     Polkington was coming to London, perhaps for as long as three months. Johnny did not know why;
     he thought perhaps to have some treatment for his rheumatism; Mrs. Polkington had arranged it.
     Julia did know why, and the short-sightedness of the policy roused her contempt. To thus put
     the family drawback out of the way, and leave him to his own devices and Mr. Gillat's care,
     seemed to her as unwise towards him as it was unkind to Johnny. She would have written that
     minute to expostulate with her mother if she had not just then been called away.</p>
    <p>These two disturbing letters arrived on the day that Joost came home from Germany, after the
     English mail for the day had gone. Julia comforted herself with this last fact when she was
     called before she had time to write to her mother; she could write when she went to bed that
     night; the letter would go just as soon as if it was written now; so she went to answer
     Mevrouw's summons to
     <pb n="111"/> admire the carved crochet hook her son had brought her as a present from Germany.
     Joost had brought several small presents besides the crochet hook, a pipe for his father, and
     two other trifles—a small vase and a photograph of a plant which was the pride of the Berlin
     gardens that year—an aloe, no yucca, but one of the true rare blooming sort, in full flower.
     Julia was asked to take her choice of these two; she chose the photograph because it seemed to
     her much more characteristic of the giver, and also because it was easier to put away. She had
     no idea of pleasing Joost by so doing; to tell the truth she hardly felt desirous of pleasing
     him, for though she had refrained from taking his blue daffodil and was in a way satisfied that
     she had done so, she did not feel exactly grateful to him for unconsciously standing between
     her and it, from which some may conclude that virtue was not an indigenous plant with
     Julia.</p>
    <p>When Denah arrived after dinner she was given the vase. Before Joost went away she had
     expressed in his hearing a wish that she had something from Berlin; she had said it rather
     pronouncedly as one might express a desire for a bear from the Rocky Mountains, or a ruby from
     Burmah; she could hardly have received one of those with more enthusiasm than she did the vase.
     She admired it from every point of view and thanked Joost delightedly; the delight, however,
     was a little modified when Mijnheer let slip the fact that Julia also had a present from
     Berlin.</p>
    <p>"Have you?" she asked suspiciously. "What is it? Show me."</p>
    <p>Julia fetched the photograph and exhibited it with as little elation as possible. Denah did
     not admire it greatly, she said she much preferred her own present.</p>
    <p>At this Joost smiled a little; it was only what he ex
     <pb n="112"/>pected, and Julia began tactfully to talk about the beauties of the vase; but
     Denah was not to be put off her main point.</p>
    <p>"Do you not prefer mine; really and truly, would you not rather it had been yours?" she
     asked.</p>
    <p>Julia could have slipped out of the answer quite easily; the Polkingtons were all good at
     saying things to be interpreted according to taste; but Joost, with signal idiocy, stepped in
     and prevented.</p>
    <p>"No," he said, "she preferred the photograph; she chose it of the two."</p>
    <p>At this intelligence Denah's face was a study; Julia could not but be amused by it although
     she was sorry. She did not want to make the girl jealous, it was absurd that she should be; but
     absurdity never prevents such things, and would not now, nor would it make her pleasanter if
     she were once fairly roused. Julia smoothed matters over as well as she could, which was very
     well considering, though she failed to entirely allay Denah's suspicions.</p>
    <p>As soon after as she could she set out for the village, leaving the field to the Dutch girl,
     and carrying with her enough unpleasant thoughts on other things to prevent her from giving any
     more consideration to the silly spasm of jealousy. She had thrust her two letters from England
     into her pocket, and as she went she kept turning and turning their news in her mind though
     without much result. There seemed very little she could do except prevent the banishing of her
     father to London. She would write to her mother about that, and, what might be rather more
     effective, to Mr. Gillat. She could tell him it must not happen, and instruct him how to place
     obstacles in the way; he would do his best to fulfil her requests, she was sure, even to going
     down to Marbridge and establish
     <pb n="113"/>ing himself there about the time of her father's intended departure. But with
     regard to the rest of her mother's plans, or Chèrie's, whichever it might be, there seemed
     nothing to be done. To write would be useless; to go home, even if she swallowed her pride and
     did so, very little better; of course she had not anything very definite to go upon, only a
     hint here and there, yet she guessed pretty well what they were doing, what spending, and what
     they thought to get by it. The old, long-headed Julia feared for the result; Mrs. Polkington,
     clever though she undoubtedly was, had never succeeded in big ventures; she had not the sort of
     mind for it; she had never made a wholly successful big stride; her real climbing had been done
     very slowly, so the old Julia feared for her. And the new one, who had grown up during the past
     months, revolted against the whole thing, finding it sordid, despicable, dishonourable even,
     somehow all wrong. And perhaps because the old cautious Julia could do nothing to avert the
     consequences, the newer nature was in the ascendant that evening, and consequences were in time
     forgotten, and disgust and weariness and shame—which included self and all things connected
     with it—took possession of the girl.</p>
    <p>By and by she heard a step behind her—Rawson-Clew. She had forgotten his existence; she was
     almost sorry to be reminded of it; she felt so ashamed of herself and her people, so conscious
     of the gulf between them and him. So very conscious of this last that she suddenly felt
     disinclined for the effort of struggling to hide or bridge it.</p>
    <p>He caught up with her. "How has the crochet progressed this week under your care?" he asked
     her lightly.</p>
    <p>"It has not progressed," she answered; "there are
     <pb n="114"/> enough mistakes in it now to occupy Denah for a long time."</p>
    <p>He took her basket from her, and she looked at him thoughtfully. He was just the same as
     usual, quiet, drawling voice, eyeglass, everything—she wondered if he were ever different; how
     he would act, say, in her circumstances. If they could change bodies, now, and he be Julia
     Polkington, with her relations, needs and opportunities, what would he do? Would he still be
     impassive, deliberate, equal to all occasions? Would he find it easy to keep his inviolable
     laws of good-breeding and honour, and so forth?</p>
    <p>"There is something I should like to ask you," she said suddenly.</p>
    <p>"Yes?" he inquired.</p>
    <p>"Is it much trouble to you to be honest?"</p>
    <p>He was a little surprised, though not so much as he would have been earlier in their
     acquaintance. "That," he said, "I expect rather depends on what you mean by honest. I imagine
     you don't refer to lying and stealing, and that sort of thing, since nobody finds it difficult
     to avoid them."</p>
    <p>"They are not gentlemanly?" she suggested.</p>
    <p>"I don't know that I ever looked at it in that way," he said; "or, indeed, any way. One does
     not think about those sort of things; one does not do them, that's all."</p>
    <p>She nodded. The careless change of pronoun, which in a way included her with himself, was not
     lost upon her.</p>
    <p>"In the matter of half-truths," she inquired; "how about them?"</p>
    <p>"I don't think I have given that subject consideration either," he answered, rather amused;
     "there does not
     <pb n="115"/> seem any need at my age. One does things, or one does not; abstractions don't
     appeal to most men after thirty."</p>
    <p>Again Julia nodded. "It looks to me," she said, "as if you take your morality, like your
     dinner, as a matter of course; it's always there; you don't have to bother after it; you don't
     really know how it comes, or what it is worth."</p>
    <p>Now and then Rawson-Clew had observed in his acquaintance with Julia, she said things which
     had a way of lighting him up to himself; this was one of the occasions. "Possibly you are
     right," he said, with faint amusement. "How do you take yours? Let us consider yours; I am sure
     it would be a great deal more interesting."</p>
    <p>"There would be more variety in it," she said significantly.</p>
    <p>"What is your opinion about half-truths?" he inquired, with grave mimicry of her.</p>
    <quote>
     <p>"'
      <l>Half a truth, however small, </l>
      <l>Is better than no truth at all,</l>'"</p>
    </quote>
    <p>she quoted. "That is so; it is better, safer to deal with—to explain away if it is found out,
     to deceive with if it is not. But it is not half so easy as the whole truth; that is the
     easiest thing in the world; it takes no ingenuity, no brains, no courage, no acting, no feeling
     the pulse of your people, no bolstering up or watching or remembering. If I wanted to teach the
     beauty of truth, I would set my pupils to do a little artistic white lying on their own
     account, to make things look four times as good as they really were, and not to forget to make
     them square together, that would teach them the advantage of truth."
     <pb n="116"/></p>
    <p>"Do you think so?" Rawson-Clew said. "It is not the usual opinion; fools and cowards are
     generally supposed to be the great dealers in deceit and subterfuge."</p>
    <p>"May be," Julia allowed; "but I don't happen to have come across that sort much; the other I
     have, and I am just about sick of it—I am sick of pretending and shamming and double-dealing,
     of saying one thing and implying another, and meaning another still—you don't know what it
     feels like, you have never had to do it; you wouldn't, of course; very likely you couldn't,
     even. I am weary of it; I am weary of the whole thing."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew screwed the glass into his eye carefully but did not look at her; he had an idea
     she would rather not. "What is it?" he asked kindly. "What has gone wrong to-night? Too much
     pudding again?"</p>
    <p>"No," she answered, with a quick, if partial, recovery; "too much humbug, too much self. I
     have seen a great deal of myself lately, and it's hateful."</p>
    <p>"I cannot agree with you."</p>
    <p>"Do you like having a lot of yourself?"</p>
    <p>"No; I like yourself."</p>
    <p>She laughed a little; in her heart she was pleased, but she only said, "I don't; I know what
     it really is."</p>
    <p>"And I do not?"</p>
    <p>"No," she answered; then, with a sudden determination to tell him the worst, and to deal in
     this newly admired honesty, she said, "I will tell you, though. You remember my father? You may
     have politely forgotten him, or smoothed out your recollections of him—remember him now; he is
     just about what you thought him."</p>
    <p>"Indeed?" the tone was that one of polite interest, which she had come to know so well. "Your
     shoe is unfastened; may I tie it for you? The question is," he went on, as he stooped to her
     shoe, "what did I think of
     <pb n="117"/> your father? I'm sure I don't know, and I hardly think you are in a position to,
     either."</p>
    <p>She moved impatiently, so that the shoelace slipped out of his hand, and he had to begin all
     over again. It was a very shabby shoe; at another time she might have minded about it, and even
     refused to have it fastened on that account; to-night she did not care, which was perhaps as
     well, for Rawson-Clew knew long ago all about the shabbiness—the only thing he did not know
     before was the good shape of the foot inside.</p>
    <p>"I know perfectly well what you thought my father," she said; "if you have forgotten, I will
     remind you. You did not think him an adventurer, I know; of course, you saw he had not brains
     enough."</p>
    <p>But here the shoe tying was finished, and Rawson-Clew intimated politely that he was not
     anxious to be reminded of things he had forgotten. "You began by saying you would tell me about
     yourself," he said; "will you not go on?"</p>
    <p>"I have more brains than my father," she said, "and no more principles."</p>
    <p>"<hi>Ergo</hi>—you succeed where he falls short; in fact, you are an adventuress—is that it?
     My dear child, you neither are, nor ever could be; believe me, I really do know, though, as you
     have indicated, my morality is rather mechanical and my experience much as other men's. You
     see, I, too, have graduated in the study of humanity in the university of cosmopolis; I don't
     think my degree is as high as yours, and I certainly did not take it so young, but I believe I
     know an adventuress when I see one. You will never do in that walk of life; I don't mean to
     insinuate that you haven't brains enough, or that you would ever lose your head; it isn't that
     you would lose, it's your heart."
     <pb n="118"/></p>
    <p>"I haven't;" Julia cried hotly. "I have not lost my heart; that has nothing to do with
     it."</p>
    <p>"I did not say that you had," Rawson-Clew reminded her; "of course not, you have not lost it,
     and could not easily. I did not mean that; I only meant that it would interfere with your
     success as an adventuress."</p>
    <p>"It would not," Julia persisted; "I don't care about people a bit; it isn't that, it is
     simply that I am sick of deception, that is why I am telling you the truth. And as for the
     other thing—the daffodil"—she forgot that he did not know about it—"I couldn't take it from any
     one so silly, so childish, so trusting."</p>
    <p>"Of course not," Rawson-Clew said. "I don't know what the daffodil thing is, nor from whom
     you could not take it—please don't tell me; I never take the slightest interest in other
     people's business, it bores me. But, you see, you bear out what I say; you are of those strong
     who are merciful; you would make no success as an adventuress. Besides, your tastes are too
     simple; I have some recollections of your mentioning corduroy—er—trousers and a diet of onions
     as the height of your ambition."</p>
    <p>Julia laughed in spite of herself. "That is only when I retire," she said. "I haven't retired
     yet; until I do I am—"</p>
    <p>"The incarnation of the seven deadly sins?" Rawson-Clew finished for her, with a smile in his
     eyes. "No doubt of it; I expect that is what makes you good company."</p>
    <p>So, after all, it came about that she did not get her confession made in full. But, then,
     there hardly seemed need for it; it appeared that Rawson-Clew already knew a great deal about
     her, and did not think the worse of her for it. Rather it seemed he thought better than she had
     even believed; he, himself, too, was rather different
     <pb n="119"/>—there had crept a note of warmth and personality into their acquaintance which
     had not been there before. Julia had pleasant thoughts for company on her homeward walk, in
     spite of the worry of the letters she carried with her; she even for a moment had an idea of
     putting the matter they contained before Rawson-Clew and asking his advice; that is, if the
     friendship which had begun to dawn on their acquaintance that evening grew yet further. It did
     grow, but she did not ask him, loyalty to her family prevented; there were, however, plenty of
     other things to talk about, and the friendship got on well until the end came.</p>
    <p>The end came about the time of the annual fair. This fair was a great event in the little
     town; it only lasted three days, and only the middle one of the three was important, or in the
     least provocative of disorder; but—so Mijnheer said—it upset business very much. After inquiry
     as to how this came about, Julia learnt that it was found necessary to give the workmen a
     holiday on the principal day. They got so drunk the night before, that most of them were unfit
     for work, and a few even had the hardihood to stop away entirely, so as to devote the whole day
     to getting drunk again. Under these circumstances, Mijnheer made a virtue of necessity, and
     gave a whole holiday to the entire staff.</p>
    <p>"Does the office have a holiday too?" Julia asked.</p>
    <p>Mijnheer nodded. "These young fellows," he said, "are all for holidays; they are not like
     their fathers. Now it is always 'I must ride on my wheel; I must row in my boat; I must play my
     piano; let us put the work away as soon as we can, and forget it.' It was not so in my young
     days; then we worked, or we slept; playing was for children. There were some great men of
     business in those days."
     <pb n="120"/></p>
    <p>Julia was not in a position to contradict this; she only said, "It is a real holiday, then,
     like a bank holiday in England?"</p>
    <p>"A real holiday, yes," he answered her; "a holiday for you too, if you like. Would you like a
     real English bank holiday?" He called to his wife: "See here," he said, "here is an English
     miss who would like an English holiday; when the workmen have theirs she shall have hers too,
     is it not so?"</p>
    <p>Mevrouw nodded, laughing. "But what will you do with it?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"I should go out," Julia answered; "if it is fine I should go out all day."</p>
    <p>"To the fair?" Mijnheer asked. "You would not like that alone; it would be very rough."</p>
    <p>"I should go out into the country," Julia said. "I should make an excursion all by
     myself."</p>
    <p>They seemed a good deal amused by her taste, but the idea suggested in fun was really
     determined upon; Julia, so Mijnheer promised, should have a holiday when every one else did,
     and do just what she pleased.</p>
    <p>"You shall do as you like," he said; "even though it is not to go to the fair and eat
      <hi>pooferchjes</hi>. It is only once in a year one can eat <hi>pooferchjes</hi>, or three
     times rather; they are to be had on each of the three days."</p>
    <p>"What are they?" Julia asked. "I have never heard of them."</p>
    <p>"Never heard of them," the old man exclaimed. "They do not have them, I suppose, on an
     English bank holiday? Then certainly you must have them here; we will go and eat them on the
     first day of the fair, when everything is nice and clean, and there are not too many people
     about. I will find a nice quiet place, and we will go and eat them together, after tea, before
     there are great crowds.
     <pb n="121"/> Will you come with me? I shall be taking my young lady to the fair like a gay
     dog."</p>
    <p>He chuckled at the idea, and Julia readily agreed. "I shall be delighted," she said.</p>
    <p>When Denah came, a little later, it seemed she would be delighted too, although she was not
     specially asked. But when she heard of the plan, she announced that her father had promised to
     take Anna and herself, and what could be better than that the parties should join? Mijnheer
     quite approved of this, so did Julia; and she, on hearing Denah's proposal, at once saw that
     Joost was included as he had not been before. Joost did not like fairs; he objected to noise,
     and glare, and crowds, and all such things; neither did he care for <hi>pooferchjes</hi>; they
     were too bilious for him. Nevertheless he agreed to join the party; Denah was quite sure it was
     entirely on her account.</p>
    <p>On the morning of the first day of the fair, Julia went into the town to buy cakes to take
     with her on to-morrow's excursion. She had not changed her mind about that; she was still fully
     determined to go and spend a long day in the Dunes. She had not told the Van Heigens of the
     place chosen; she and Mijnheer had much fun and mystery about it, he declaring she was going to
     the wood to ride donkeys with the head gardener's fat wife. There was another thing she also
     had not told the Van Heigens—a slight alteration there had been in her plans; she was not, as
     she had first intended, going alone. It had somehow come about that Rawson-Clew was going with
     her; he had never seen the Dunes, and he had nothing to do that day, and he was not going to
     Herr Van de Greutz in the evening, it seemed rather a good idea that he should go for a holiday
     too; Julia saw no objection to it, but also she saw that it would not do to tell her
     <pb n="122"/>Dutch employers. She had never mentioned Rawson Clew to them—there had not seemed
     any need; she never met him till she was clear of the town and the range of reporting tongues
     there, and she usually parted from him before she reached the village and the observers there,
     so nothing was known of the evening walks. Which was rather a pity, for, as Julia afterwards
     found out, it is often wisest to tell something of your doings, especially if you cannot tell
     all, and they are likely to come in for public notice.</p>
    <p>Julia bought her cakes, and went about the town feeling as holiday-like as the gayest peasant
     there, although she had no wonderful holiday head-dress of starched lace and gold plates. She
     did not see any one she knew, except old Marthe, Herr Van de Greutz's housekeeper. She had met
     the old woman several times when she was marketing, and was on speaking terms with her now, so
     she had to stop and listen to her troubles. They were only the same old tale; her newest young
     cook had left suddenly, and she had come to the town to see if she could get another from among
     the girls who had come in for the fair. She had no success at all, and was setting out for
     home, despondent, and not at all comforted to think that she would have to trudge in and try
     all over again the day after to-morrow. To-morrow, itself, the great day, it was no good
     trying; no girl would pay attention to business then.</p>
    <p>In the evening Julia went again into the town, but this time with Mijnheer and Joost, and
     dressed in her best dress. It was not at all a new dress, nor at all a grand one, but it was
     well chosen, well made and well fitted, and certainly very well put on; the gloves and hat,
     too, accorded with it, and she herself was in a humour of gaiety that bordered on brilliancy.
     Was she not going to have a holiday to-morrow, and was she not going to spend
     <pb n="123"/> it in company with a man she liked, and in despite of Dutch propriety, which
     would certainly have been thoroughly and outrageously shocked thereby? Denah knew nothing of
     the causes at work, but she was not slow to discern the result when she and her father and
     sister met the Van Heigen party that evening. She smoothed the bow at the neck of her best
     dress, and looked at her gloves discontentedly; she did not altogether admire Julia's clothes,
     they were not at all Dutch; but she had an intuitive idea that they came nearer to Paris, the
     sartorial ideal of the nations, than her own did. She looked suspiciously at the English girl,
     her eyes were shining and sparkling like stars; they were full of alert interest and
     half-suppressed mischief. She looked at everything, and overlooked nothing, though she was
     talking to Mijnheer in a soft, purring voice, that was full of fun and wickedness. Now she
     turned to Joost, and her voice took another tone; she was teasing him, making fun of him in a
     way that Denah decided was scandalous, although his father was there, aiding and abetting her.
     Joost did not seem to resent it a bit; he listened quite serenely, and even turned a look on
     her as one who has another and private interpretation of the words. Anna saw nothing of this;
     she only thought Julia very nice, and her dress pretty, and her talk gay. But Denah, though not
     always so acute, was in love, and she saw a good deal, and treasured it up for use when the
     occasion should offer.</p>
    <p>They ate <hi>pooferchjes</hi>, sitting in a funny little covered stall; at least, the top and
     three sides were covered, the fourth was open to the street. A long, narrow table, with clean
     white calico spread on it, ran down the centre of the place, and narrow forms stood on either
     side of it. It was lighted by a Chinese lantern hung from the roof, and also, and more
     especially, by a flare outside of the
     <pb n="124"/> charcoal fire, where the <hi>pooferchjes</hi> were cooked. A powerful brown-armed
     peasant woman made them, beating the batter till it frothed, and dropping it by the spoonful
     into the little hollows in the great sheet of iron that glowed on the stove without. The glow
     of the fire was on her too, on her short skirt and her fine arms, and the flaring light, that
     flickered in the breeze, danced on her strong, brown face, with its resolute lines, and
     splendid gold-ringed head-dress. People kept passing to and fro all the time, or stopping
     sometimes to look in; solemnly-gay holiday people, enjoying themselves after their own fashion.
     The light flickered on them, too, and on the brick pavement, and on the trees, plentiful almost
     as canals in the town. Julia leaned forward and looked, and listened to the guttural Dutch
     voices, and the curious patois to be heard now and then, and the distant notes of music that
     blended with it. And the flickering lights and shadows danced across her mind, and the simple
     holiday feeling of it all got to her head.</p>
    <p>Then the <hi>pooferchjes</hi> were done and brought in, little round, crisp things, smoking
     hot, and very greasy; something like tiny English pancakes—at least one might say so if one had
     not tasted them. And then more people came in and sat at the opposite side of the table, a
     gardener of another bulb grower, and his two daughters. He raised his hat to the Van Heigen
     party, and received a similar salutation in return, though he and they were careful to put
     their hats on again, a draught being a thing much feared. Mijnheer shook hands with the father,
     and they entered into conversation about the weather; the girls looked across at Denah and
     Anna, and more still at Julia, whose small, slim hands they evidently admired.</p>
    <p>But at last the <hi>pooferchjes</hi> were all eaten and paid for. To do the latter the
     notary, Mijnheer and Joost all
     <pb n="125"/> brought out large purses and counted out small coins with care, and the party
     came out, making way for new-comers. They did not go straight home again, as was first
     intended, Julia's interest and gaiety seemed to have infected the others—all except Denah, and
     they walked for a little while among the booths of toys, and sweets, and peepshows, and
     entertainments. And as they went, Denah grew more and more silent, watching Julia, who was
     walking with Joost; the arrangement was not of the English girl's seeking, but Denah took no
     account of that. The thing of which she did take account was that they two talked as they
     walked together, he as well as she, but both with the ease and quick comprehension of people
     who have talked together often.</p>
    <p>Mijnheer stopped to look at the merry-go-round; he admired the cheerful tune that it played.
     He was not a connoisseur of music; a barrel-organ was as good to him as the organ in the Groote
     Kerk. The others stopped too; Anna exclaimed on the life-like and clever appearance of the
     bobbing horses, whereupon her father suggested that perhaps the girls would like to try a ride
     on the machine, and then befel the crowning mischief of the evening. Julia and Anna accepted
     the proposal readily. Denah declined; she felt in no humour for it; also she thought a refusal
     showed a superior mind—one likely to appeal to a serious young man, who had no taste for the
     gaudy, gay, or fast, and who also had a tendency towards seasickness. But, alas, for the
     fickleness of man! While Denah stood with her father and Mijnheer, Julia rode round the centre
     of lighted mirrors on a prancing wooden horse, and Joost—the serious, the sometimes
     seasick—rode beside her on a dappled grey, to the familiar old English tune,
     "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-a."</p>

    <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
    <head>THE HOLIDAY</head>
    <p>The Dunes lay some little distance from the town, a low, but suddenly-rising hill boundary,
     that shut in the basin of flat land. They were all of pure sand, though in many places so
     matted with vegetation that it was hardly recognisable as such. Trees grew in places,
     especially on the side that fronted towards the town; the way up lay through a dense young wood
     of beech and larch, and a short, broad-leafed variety of poplar. There was no undergrowth, but
     between the dead leaves one could see that a dark green, short-piled moss had managed to find a
     hold here and there, though so smooth was it that it looked more like old enamel than a natural
     growth. The trees had the appearance of high summer, deeply, intensely green, so that they
     seemed almost blackish in mass. There was no breeze among them; even the dapples of sunlight
     which found their way through the roof of leaves hardly stirred, but lay in light patches, like
     scattered gold upon the ground. Flies and gnats moved and shimmered, a busy life, whose small
     voices were the only sound to be heard; all else was very still, with the glorious reposeful
     stillness of full summer; not oppressive, without weariness or exhaustion, rather as if the
     whole creation paused at this zenith to look round on its works, and beheld and saw that they
     were all very good.</p>
    <p>There were no clear paths, apparently few people went
     <pb n="127"/> that way; certainly there was no one about when Julia and Rawson-Clew came. It is
     true they saw a kind of little beer-garden at the foot of the slope, but there was no one
     idling about it.</p>
    <p>"We shall have to come back here for lunch," Julia said.</p>
    <p>And when he suggested that it was rather a pity to have to retrace their steps, she answered,
     "It doesn't matter, we are not going anywhere particular; we may just as well wander one way as
     another. When we get to the top this time we will explore to the right, and when we get there
     again after lunch, we will go to the left; don't you think that is the best way? This is to be
     a holiday, you know."</p>
    <p>"Is a real holiday like a dog's wanderings?" Rawson-Clew inquired; "bounded by no purpose
     except dinner when hungry?"</p>
    <p>Julia thought it must be something of the kind. "Though," she said, "dogs always seem to have
     some end in view, or perhaps a dozen ends, for though they tear off after an imaginary interest
     as if there was nothing else in the world, they get tired of it, or else start another, and
     forget all about the first."</p>
    <p>"That must also be part of the essence of a holiday," Rawson-Clew said; "at least, one would
     judge it to be so; boys and dogs, the only things in nature who really understand the art of
     holiday-making, chase wild geese, and otherwise do nothing of any account, with an
     inexhaustible energy, and a purposeful determination wonderful to behold. Also, they forget
     that there is such a thing as to-morrow, so that must be important too."</p>
    <p>"I can't do that," Julia said.</p>
    <p>"You might try when you get to the top," he suggested.
     <pb n="128"/> "I will try then; I don't think I could do anything requiring an effort just
     now."</p>
    <p>Julia agreed that she could not either, and they went on up straight before them. It is as
     easy to climb a sand-hill in one place as in another, provided you stick your feet in the right
     way, and do not mind getting a good deal of sand in your boots. So they went straight, and at
     last got clear of the taller trees, and were struggling in thickets of young poplars, and other
     sinewy things. The sand was firmer, but honeycombed with rabbit holes, and tangled with
     brambles, and the direction was still upwards, though the growth was so thick, and the ground
     so bad, that it was often necessary to go a long way round. But in time they were through this
     too, and really out on the top. Here there was nothing but the Dunes, wide, curving land, that
     stretched away and away, a tableland of little hollows and hills, like some sea whose waves
     have been consolidated; near at hand its colours were warm, if not vivid, but in the far
     distance it grew paler as the vegetation became less and less, till, far away, almost beyond
     sight, it failed to grey helm grass, and then altogether ceased, leaving the sand bare. Behind
     lay the trees through which they had come, sloping downwards in banks of cool shadows to the
     map-like land and the distant town below; away on right and left were other groups of trees, on
     sides of hills and in rounded hollows, looking small enough from here, but in reality woods of
     some size. Here there was nothing; but, above, a great blue sky, which seemed very close; and,
     underfoot, low-growing Dune roses and wild thyme which filled the warm, still air with its
     matchless scent; nothing but these, and space, and sunshine, and silence.</p>
    <p>Julia stopped and looked round, drawing in her breath;
     <pb n="129"/> she had found what she had come to see—what, perhaps, she had been vaguely
     wanting to find for a long time.</p>
    <p>"Isn't it good?" she said at last. "Did you know there was so much room—so much room
     anywhere?"</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew looked in the direction she did; he had seen so much of the world, and she had
     seen so little of it—that is, of the part which is solitary and beautiful. Yet he felt
     something of her enthusiasm for this sunny, empty place—than which he had seen many finer
     things every year of his life.</p>
    <p>Perhaps this thought occurred to her, for she turned to him rather wistfully: "I expect it
     does not seem very much to you," she said; "you have seen such a great deal."</p>
    <p>"I do not remember to have seen anything quite like this," he answered; "and if I had, what
     then? One does not get tired of things."</p>
    <p>Julia looked at him thoughtfully. "I wonder," she said, "if one would? If one would get weary
     of it, and want to go back to the other kind of life?"</p>
    <p>She was not thinking of Dune country, rather of the simple life it represented to her just
     then. Rawson-Clew caught the note of seriousness in her tone and reminded her that thought for
     the past or future was no part of a holiday. "Remember," he said, "you are to-day to emulate
     dogs and boys."</p>
    <p>She laughed. "How am I to begin?" she asked. "How will you?"</p>
    <p>"I shall sit down," he said; "I feel I could be inconsequent much better if I sat down to it;
     that is no doubt because I am past my first youth."</p>
    <p>"No," she said, sitting down and putting her hat beside her; "it is because your
     folly-muscles are stiff from want of use; you have played lots of things, I expect—it is
     <pb n="130"/> part of your necessary equipment to be able to do so, but I doubt if you have
     ever played the fool systematically. I don't believe you have ever done, and certainly never
     enjoyed anything inconsequent or foolish in your life."</p>
    <p>"If you were to ask me," he returned, "I should hardly say you excelled in that direction
     either. How many inconsequent and foolish things have you done in your life?"</p>
    <p>"Some, and I should like to do some more. If I were alone now, do you know what I should do?
     You see that deep hollow of sparkling white sand? I should take off my clothes and lie there in
     the sun."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew turned so that his back was that way. "Do not let me prevent you," he said.</p>
    <p>Julia made use of the opportunity to empty the sand out of her boots.</p>
    <p>He looked round as she was finishing fastening them. "But why put them on again?" he
     asked.</p>
    <p>"Because I haven't retired from the world, yet," she answered, "and so I can't do quite all I
     like."</p>
    <p>"When you do retire, will this ideal summer costume also be included in the programme? Your
     taste in dress grows simpler; quite ancient British, in fact."</p>
    <p>"The ancient Britons wore paint, and probably had fashions in it; I don't think of imitating
     them. Tell me," she said, turning now to gather the sweet-scented wild thyme, "did you ever
     really do anything foolish in your life? I should like to know."</p>
    <p>He answered her that he had, but without convincing her. Afterwards, he came to the
     conclusion that, whatever might have been the case before, he that day qualified to take rank
     with any one in the matter.</p>
    <p>All the same, it was a very pleasant day, and they both enjoyed it much; it is doubtful if
     any one in the town
     <pb n="131"/> or its environs enjoyed that holiday more than these two, who, from different
     reasons, had probably never had so real a holiday before. They wandered over the great open
     tract of land, meeting no one; once they came near enough to the seaward edge to see the
     distant shimmer of water; once they found themselves in the part where there has been some
     little attempt at cultivation, and small patches of potatoes struggle for life, and a little
     railway crosses the sandhills. Twice they came upon the road along which, on working days, the
     peasant women bring their fish to market in the town. But chiefly they kept to the small, dense
     woods, where the sunlight only splashed the ground; or to the open solitary spaces where the
     bees hummed in the wild thyme, and the butterflies chased each other over the low rose
     bushes.</p>
    <p>A good deal after mid-day, at a time dictated entirely by choice, and not custom, they made
     their way back to the beer garden. It was a very little place, scarcely worthy of the name; the
     smallest possible house, more like a barn than anything else, right in the shadow of the wood.
     The fare to be obtained was bad beer, excellent coffee, new bread, and old cheese; but it was
     enough, supplemented by the cakes bought yesterday in the town; Julia knew enough of the ways
     of the place to know one can bring one's own food to such places without giving offence. As in
     the morning, when they first passed it, there was no one about, every one had gone to the fair,
     except one taciturn old woman who brought the required things and then shut herself in the
     house. The meal was spread under the trees on a little green-painted table, with legs buried
     deep in sand; there were two high, straight chairs set up to the table, and a wooden footstool
     put by one for Julia, who, seeing it, said this was certainly a picnic, and it was really
     necessary to eat the <hi>broodje</hi> in the correct
     <pb n="132"/> picnic way. Rawson-Clew tried, with much gravity, but she laughed till the
     taciturn old woman looked out of window, and wondered who they were, and how they came to be
     here.</p>
    <p>When the meal was done, they went back again up the steep slope, and then away on the left.
     The country on this side was less open, and more hilly, deeper hollows and larger woods, still
     there was not much difficulty in finding the way. The latter part of the day was not so fine as
     the earlier, the sky clouded over, and, though there was still no wind, the air grew more
     chilly. They hardly noticed the change, being in a dense young wood where there was little
     light, but Julia lost something of the holiday spirit, and Rawson-Clew became grave, talking
     more seriously of serious things than had ever before happened in their curious
     acquaintanceship. They sat down to rest in a green hollow, and Julia began to arrange neatly
     the bunch of short-stemmed thyme flowers that she carried. They had been quiet for some little
     time, she thinking about their curious acquaintance, and wondering when it would end. Of course
     it would end—she knew that; it was a thing of mind only; there was very little feeling about
     it—a certain mutual interest and a liking that had grown of late, kindness on his part,
     gratitude on hers, nothing more. But of its sort it had grown to be intimate; she had told him
     things of her thoughts, and of herself, and her people too, that she had told to no one else;
     and he, which was perhaps more remarkable, had sometimes returned the compliment. And yet by
     and by—soon, perhaps—he would go away, and it would be as if they had never met; it was like
     people on a steamer together, she thought, for the space of the voyage they saw each other
     daily, saw more intimately into each other than many blood relations did, and then, when
     <pb n="133"/> port was reached, they separated, the whole thing finished. She wondered when
     this would finish, and just then Rawson-Clew spoke, and unconsciously answered her thought.</p>
    <p>"I am going back to England soon," he said.</p>
    <p>She looked up. "Is your work here finished?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"It is at an end," he answered; "that is the same thing."</p>
    <p>Then she, her intuition enlightened by a like experience suddenly knew that he, too, had
     failed. "You mean it cannot be done," she said.</p>
    <p>He opened his cigarette case, and selected a cigarette carefully. "May I smoke?" he asked;
     "there are a good many gnats and mosquitoes about here." He felt for a match, and, when he had
     struck it, asked impersonally, "Do you believe things cannot be done?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," she answered; "I know that sometimes they cannot; I have proved it to myself."</p>
    <p>"You have not, then, much opinion of the people who do not know when they are beaten?"</p>
    <p>"I don't think I have," she answered; "you cannot help knowing when you are beaten if you
     really are—that is, unless you are a fool. Of course, if you are only beaten in one round, or
     one effort, that is another thing; you can get up and try again. But if you are really and
     truly beaten, by yourself, or circumstances, or something—well, there's an end; there is
     nothing but to get up and go on."</p>
    <p>"Just so; in that case, as you say, there is not much going to be done, except going
     home."</p>
    <p>Julia nodded. "But I can't even do that," she said. "I am beaten, but I have got to stay here
     all the same, having nowhere exactly to go."</p>
    <p>This was the first time she had spoken even indirectly of her own future movements. "But,
     perhaps," he sug
     <pb n="134"/>gested, "if you stay, you may find a back way to your object after all."</p>
    <p>She shook her head. "It is the back way I tried. No, there is no way; it is blocked. I know,
     because it is myself that blocks it."</p>
    <p>"In that case," he said, "I'm afraid I must agree with you; there is no way; oneself is about
     the most insurmountable block of all. I might have known that you were hardly likely to make
     any mistake as to whether you were really beaten or not."</p>
    <p>"I should not think it was a mistake you were likely to make either," she observed.</p>
    <p>"You think not? Well, I had no chance this time; the fact has been made pretty obvious to
     me."</p>
    <p>She did not say she was sorry; in her opinion it was an impertinence to offer condolence to
     failure. "I suppose," she said, after a pause, "there is not a back way—a door, or window,
     even, to your object?"</p>
    <p>"Unfortunately, no. There are no windows at the back; and as to the door—like you, it was
     that which I tried, with the result that recently—yesterday, in fact—I was metaphorically shown
     out."</p>
    <p>Julia had learnt enough by this time, though she had not been told for certain, that her
     first suspicions were right; to be sure, it was the explosive which took Rawson-Clew to the
     little village evening after evening. She had gathered as much from various things which had
     been said, though she did not know at all how he was trying to get it, nor in what way he had
     introduced himself to Herr Van de Greutz. Whatever method he had tried it was now clear he had
     failed; no doubt been found out, for the chemist, unlike Joost Van Heigen, was the very reverse
     of unsuspecting, and thoroughly on the look-out for other nations who wanted to share his
     discovery. For
     <pb n="135"/> a moment Julia wished she had been in Rawson-Clew's place; of course she, too,
     might have failed—probably would; she had no reason to think she would succeed where he could
     not; but she certainly would not have failed in this for the reason she had failed with the
     blue daffodil. The attempt would have been so thoroughly well worth making; there would have
     been some sport in it, and a foe worthy of her steel. In spite of her desire for the simple
     life, she had too much real ability for this sort of intrigue, and too much past practice in
     subterfuge, not to experience lapses of inclination for it when she saw such work being done,
     and perhaps not done well. Of this, however, she naturally did not speak to Rawson-Clew; she
     rearranged her flowers in silence for a little while, at last she said—</p>
    <p>"It is hateful to fail."</p>
    <p>"It is ignominious, certainly; one does not wish to blazon it from the housetops; still,
     doubtless like your crochet work, it is good discipline."</p>
    <p>"Maybe," Julia allowed, but without conviction. "Yours seems a simple failure, mine is a
     compound one. If it is ignominious, as you say, to fail, it would have been equally ignominious
     in another way if I had succeeded. I could not have been satisfied either way."</p>
    <p>"That sounds very complicated," Rawson-Clew said; "but then, I imagine you are a complicated
     young person."</p>
    <p>"And you are not."</p>
    <p>"Not young, certainly," he said, lighting another cigarette.</p>
    <p>"Nor complicated," she insisted; "you are built on straight lines; there are given things you
     can do and can't do, would do and would not do, and might do in an emer
     <pb n="136"/>gency. It is a fine kind of person to be, but it is not the kind which surprises
     itself."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew blew a smoke-ring into the air; he was smiling a little.</p>
    <p>"How old are you?" he said. "Twenty? Almost twenty-one, is it? And until you were sixteen you
     knocked about a bit? Sixteen is too young to come much across the natural man—not the artful
     dodging man, or the man of civilisation, but the natural, primitive man, own blood relation to
     Adam and the king of the Cannibal Islands. You may meet him by and by, and if you do he may
     surprise you; he is full of surprises—he rather surprises himself, that is, if his local
     habitat is ordinarily an educated, decent person."</p>
    <p>"You have not got a natural man," Julia said shortly; she was annoyed, without quite knowing
     why, by his manner.</p>
    <p>"Have I not? Quite likely; certainly, he has never bothered me, but I should not like to
     count on him. Since we have got to personalities, may I say that you have got a natural woman,
     and plenty of her; also a marked taste for the works of the machine, in preference to the face
     usually presented to the company?"</p>
    <p>"The works are the only interesting part; I don't care for the drawing-room side of things;
     they are cultivated, but they are too much on the skin. I would much rather be a stoker, or an
     engineer, than sit on deck all day and talk about Florentine art, and the Handel Festival, and
     Egyptology, and the gospel of Tolstoy, and play cricket and quoits, and dance a little, and
     sing a little, and flirt a little, ever so nicely. Oh, there are lots of girls who can do all
     those things, and do them equally well; I know a few who can, well off, well-bred girls—you
     must know a great many. They are clever to begin with, and they
     <pb n="137"/> are taught that way; it is a perfect treat to meet them and watch them, but I
     never want to imitate them, even if I could—and there is no danger of that. I would rather be
     in the engine-room, with my coat off, a bit greasy and very profane, and doing something. There
     would be more flesh and blood there, even if it were a bit grubby; I believe I'm more at home
     with people who can do—well, what's necessary, even if it is not exactly nice."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew knew exactly the kind of woman she had described for the deck—he met them often;
     charming creatures, far as the poles asunder from the girl who spoke of them; he liked them—in
     moderation, and in their place, much as his forebears of fifty years ago had liked theirs, the
     delicate, sensitive creatures of that era. He had never regarded Julia in that light; he found
     her certainly more entertaining as a companion, though also very far short of the standard as a
     woman and an ornament.</p>
    <p>"The people in the engine-room," he observed, "would certainly be more useful in an
     emergency; still, life is not made up entirely of emergencies."</p>
    <p>"No," Julia answered; "and in between times such people are better not on show—I know that;
     that is why I do not care for the drawing-room side of things, I don't know enough to shine in
     them."</p>
    <p>"Do you think it is a matter of knowledge?" he asked, "or inclination? If it comes to
     knowledge I should say you had a rather remarkable stock of an unusual sort, and at first hand.
     That may not be what is required for a complete drawing-room success, though I am not sure that
     it is not more interesting—say for an excursion—than a flitting glance at the subjects you
     mention, and about eighteen or twenty more that you did not."
     <pb n="138"/></p>
    <p>Julia looked up, half pleased, doubtful as to whether or not to interpret this as a
     compliment; she never knew quite how much he meant of what he said; his manner was exactly the
     same, whether he was in fun or in earnest. But if she thought of asking him now she was
     prevented, for at that moment Mr. Gillat's watch slipped out of her belt into her lap, and she
     saw the time.</p>
    <p>"How late is it!" she exclaimed. "We ought to have started half-an-hour ago; it will take me
     two hours, and more, to get home from here, even if I go by the tram in the town."</p>
    <p>She rose as she spoke, and he rose more slowly.</p>
    <p>"Shall I take your flowers for you?" he asked. "They seem rather inclined to tumble about;
     don't you think they would be safer in my pocket? As you say you are going to dry them, it
     won't matter crushing them."</p>
    <p>She gave them to him, and he put the sweet-smelling bunch into his pocket, then they started
     for the edge of the wood.</p>
    <p>"It is much colder," Julia said; "and the sun is all gone; I suppose the clouds have been
     coming gradually, but I did not notice before. If it is going to rain, we shall get decidedly
     wet before we get back."</p>
    <p>"I am afraid so," he agreed; "you have no coat."</p>
    <p>She told him that did not matter, she did not mind getting wet, and she spoke with a cheerful
     buoyancy that carried conviction.</p>
    <p>When they reached the outskirts of the wood, however, they saw there was not much chance of
     rain, but a much worse evil threatened. All the distance on the seaward side was blotted out, a
     fine white mist shut out the curving land in that direction. It was blowing up towards them,
     rolling down the little hills in billowy puffs, and
     <pb n="139"/> lying filmy, yet dense, in the hollows, moved by a wind unfelt here.</p>
    <p>"A sea fog," Julia said; "I wonder how far it is coming."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew wondered too; he thought, as she did, that there was every chance of its coming
     far and fast, but it did not seem necessary to either of them to say anything so unpleasantly
     and obviously probable.</p>
    <p>They set out homewards as fast as they could; it was a long way to the place where they had
     climbed up, unfortunately all across open country, entirely without roads or definite paths,
     and the drifting sea fog was coming up fast, bound, it would seem, the same way. Soon it was
     upon them; they felt its advance in the chill that, like cold fingers, laid hold on everything;
     it came quite silently up from behind, without noticeable wind, eerily creeping up and
     enfolding everything, putting a white winding-sheet not about the earth only, but the very air
     also. The cotton blouse that Julia wore became limp and wet as if it had been dipped in water;
     she could see the fog condensing in beads on her companion's coat almost like hoar frost; it
     lay on every low-growing rose bush and bramble that they stepped upon, a curious transformer of
     all near objects, a complete obliterator of all more distant ones.</p>
    <p>They pushed on as quickly as might be, climbing little hills, descending into hollows;
     stumbling among rabbit holes, threading their way through thickets; apparently finding
     something amusing in the patriarchal colonies of rabbit burrows that tripped them up, and
     stopping to argue, though hardly in earnest, as to whether they had passed that way or not,
     when some white-barked tree, or other landmark, loomed suddenly out of the thickening mist.
     Once it seemed the fog was going to lift; Julia thought she saw the outline of a distant hill,
     but either
     <pb n="140"/> it was closed in again directly, or else she mistook a thicker fold of cloud for
     a more solid object, for it was lost almost before she pointed it out.</p>
    <p>For something over two hours they walked and stumbled, and went up small ascents and came
     down small declines; then suddenly they came upon the white-barked tree again. It was the same
     one that they had seen more than an hour and a half ago; Rawson-Clew recognised it by a
     peculiar warty growth where the branches forked; they had now approached it from the other
     side, but clearly it was the same one, and they had come round in a circle.</p>
    <p>He stopped and pointed it out to her. "I am afraid," he said, "we had better do what is
     recommended when the clouds come down on the mountains."</p>
    <p>"And that is?" Julia asked.</p>
    <p>"Sit down and wait till they shift."</p>
    <p>She could not but see the advisability of this, also she was very tired, the going for these
     two hours had not been easy, and it had come at the end of a long day. She would not admit,
     even to herself, that she was tired, but she was, so she agreed to the waiting; after all, it
     was impossible to pretend longer that they were going to get home easily, and were not really
     hopelessly astray.</p>
    <p>"We will go a little way in among the trees," Rawson-Clew said; "it is more sheltered, and we
     shall be able to find the way quite as easily from one place as another when the fog
     lifts."</p>
    <p>They found as sheltered a spot as they could, and sat down under a big tree; as they did so
     his hand came in contact with Julia's wet sleeve and cold arm. "How cold you are!" he said.
     "You have nothing on."</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, I have," she assured him. "I did not avail myself of your permission this morning."
     <pb n="141"/></p>
    <p>He took off his coat and put it round her.</p>
    <p>But she threw it off again. "That won't do at all," she said; "now you have nothing on, and
     that is much more improper; women may sit in their shirt sleeves, men may not."</p>
    <p>"Don't be absurd!" he said authoritatively; "you are to keep that on," and he wrapped it
     about her with a decision that brought home to her her youth and smallness.</p>
    <p>"You are shutting all the damp in," she protested, shifting her point of attack, "and that is
     very unwholesome. I shan't get warm; I haven't any warmth to start with; you are wasting what
     you have got to no purpose."</p>
    <p>But he did not waste it, for eventually it was arranged that they sat close together under
     the tree, with the coat put as far as it would go over both of them. Rawson-Clew was not given
     to thinking how things looked, he did what he thought necessary, or advisable, without taking
     any thought of that kind; so it did not occur to him how this arrangement might look to an
     unprejudiced observer, had there been any such. But Julia, with her faculty for seeing herself
     as others saw her, was much, though silently, amused as she thought of the Van Heigens. Poor,
     kind folks, they were doubtless already wondering what could have become of her; if they could
     only have seen her sitting thus, with an unknown man, what would their Dutch propriety have
     said?</p>
    <p>"Do you suppose this fog will be in the town?" Rawson-Clew said, after a time.</p>
    <p>"No," she answered, "I should think not; from what I have heard, I think it is very
     unlikely."</p>
    <p>"Then the Van Heigens won't know what has become of you?"</p>
    <p>"Not a bit in the world; they don't even know where
     <pb n="142"/> I was going to-day. I did not tell them; I am afraid they will be rather uneasy
     about me, but perhaps not so very much, they know by this time I can take care of myself;
     besides, I shall be home before bed-time, if the fog lifts."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew agreed, and they talked of other things. Julia held the opinion that when an evil
     has to be endured, not cured, there is no good in discussing it over and over again; she had a
     considerable gift for making the best of other things besides opportunities.</p>
    <p>But the fog did not lift soon; it did not grow denser, but it did not grow less; it just lay
     soft and chilly, casting a white pall of silence on all things, closing day before its time,
     and making it impossible to say when evening ended and night began. Gradually the two who
     waited for its lifting fell into silence, and Julia, tired out, at last dropped asleep, her
     head tilted back against the tree-trunk, her shoulder pressed close against Rawson-Clew under
     the shelter of his coat.</p>
    <p>He did not move, he was afraid of waking her; he sat watching, waiting in the eerie white
     stillness, until at last the space before him altered, and gradually between the trees he saw
     the faint outline of a hill, dark against the dark sky. Slowly the white mist rolled from it, a
     billowy, ghostly thing, that left a black, vague world, only dimly seen. He looked at the
     sleeping girl, then at the hill; the fog was clearing, there was no doubt about that; soon it
     would be quite gone, but it would be a very dark night, the stars would hardly show, and the
     moon was now long down. He was not at all sure of being able to find his way across this
     undulating country, so entirely devoid of prominent features, in a very dark night. Rather he
     was nearly sure that he could not do it; and though he had a by no means low opinion of Julia's
     abilities, he did not think that she could either. Also, with a sense
     <pb n="143"/> of dramatic fitness equal to that of the girl's he thought their arrival in the
     town would be rather ill-timed if they started now. It would be wiser to wait till after it was
     light, though dawn was not so very early now, the summer being far advanced. So he decided, and
     Julia slept peacefully on, her head dropping lower and lower, till finally it reached his
     shoulder. But he did not move; he left it resting there, and waited, thinking of nothing
     perhaps, or anything; or perhaps of that unknown quantity, the natural man, which has a way of
     stirring sometimes even in the most civilised, at night time. So he sat and watched for the
     dawn.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER X</head>
    <head>TO-MORROW</head>
    <p>It was a bright sunny morning, and, though the third and last day of the fair, people went to
     their business as usual. The Dutch are early risers, and set about their day's work in good
     time; but even had they been the reverse, the latest of them would have been about before Julia
     and Rawson-Clew reached the outskirts of the town. They had stopped for breakfast at the first
     village they came to after leaving the Dunes, this on the principle of being hung for a sheep
     rather than a lamb. It did not seem to matter being a little later considering the necessarily
     unreasonable hour of their return; also Julia, with the instinct of her family for detail;
     preferred to set herself to rights so as to present the best appearance possible when she
     arrived at the Van Heigens'. It was not natural, of course, that a person should appear too
     neat and orderly after a night of adventure, lost on the Dunes; but the reverse was not
     becoming. Julia hit the medium between the two with a nicety which might have cost one not a
     Polkington some thought, but to one of them was merely the natural thing.</p>
    <p>Together Julia and Rawson-Clew walked to the outskirts of the town. Their ways parted
     there—his to the left, hers to the right; it was the port of which she had thought yesterday,
     the place of final separation. He had proposed to go with her to the Van Heigens, so as to bear
     <pb n="145"/> testimony to what had befallen, and to assure them that she was quite safe; but
     she would not have this, she felt she could manage very much better without him, his presence
     would only require a good deal of extra explanation, none too easy to give. He guessed the
     reason of her refusal and saw the wisdom of it, although he felt annoyed that she had, as he
     now perceived she must, concealed their earlier acquaintance. It might have been advisable,
     seeing Dutch notions of propriety; but it placed the matter in a rather invidious light, and
     also began to bring home to him the fact, which grew very much more evident before the day was
     over, that he had distinguished himself by an act of really remarkable folly.</p>
    <p>They had almost reached the town, in fact had passed some small houses, the dwelling-places
     of carriage proprietors and washerwomen, when a girl stepped out of a doorway some distance
     ahead of them. She glanced in their direction, then stared.</p>
    <p>"There's Denah," Julia said; she did not speak with consternation though Denah was about the
     last person she wanted to see just then. Consternation is a waste of time and energy when you
     are found out, a bold face and immediate actions are usually best. Julia waved her hand in
     cheerful greeting to the Dutch girl.</p>
    <p>But Denah did not return the greeting; instead, after her stare of astonished recognition,
     she turned and set off up the road towards where it joined a more important street with trams,
     which ran into the town.</p>
    <p>"Hulloah?" Julia said softly, and quick as thought she turned too, and the hand that had
     waved to Denah was signaling to a carriage which at that moment drove out of a stable-yard
     near. A light had come into her eyes, a dancing light like the gleam on a sword-blade. There
     was a little wee smile about her lips, too, which somehow
     <pb n="146"/> brought to Rawson-Clew's mind a man he once knew who had sung softly to himself
     all the time he prepared for the brigands who were known to be about to rush his camp.</p>
    <p>"She'll take a tram," Julia said gaily, looking towards the speeding figure; "she is too
     careful to waste her money even to spite any one of whom she is jealous."</p>
    <p>The cab drew up, and Julia, not failing to see Denah fulfil her words at the junction of the
     street, got in. Rawson-Clew followed her. She would have prevented him.</p>
    <p>"Don't come," she said; "I don't want you. Good-bye."</p>
    <p>But he insisted. "I certainly am coming," he said, and ordered the man to drive on into the
     town, telling Julia to give the address.</p>
    <p>She did so, weighing in her mind the while the chances of Rawson-Clew's knowledge of Dutch
     being equal to following all that was said when three people spoke at once, all of them in a
     great state of excitement. She thought it was possible he would not master every detail, but at
     the same time she did not wish him to try; it would be insupportable to have him dragged into
     this, and in return for his kindness to her have a dozen vulgar and ridiculous things said and
     insinuated.</p>
    <p>"Look here," she said, "there is not any need for you to come, I can do better without you, I
     can indeed. I have got to explain things, of course, but, as I told you before, I have had some
     practice at dodging and explaining. I shall reach the Van Heigens' before Denah, so I shall get
     the first hearing, that's all I want, I can explain beautifully."</p>
    <p>"You cannot explain me away," Rawson-Clew answered. "I know I was not to have figured in the
     original account, that is obvious, but it is equally obvious that I must figure in this one. I
     prefer to give it myself."
     <pb n="147"/></p>
    <p>"Oh, but that won't do at all!" Julia said. "Please leave it to me, it would be nothing to
     me, I am used to tight places, and it would be an insufferable annoyance to you. I really don't
     want you to suffer for your kindness to me—you have no idea what absurd and ridiculous things
     they will say."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew had been polishing his eyeglass, he put it back in his eye before he spoke. "My
     dear child," he said; "in spite of the sheltered life with which you credit me, I assure you I
     have a very clear idea of the kind of things they will say."</p>
    <p>"Then for goodness sake, leave it to me," Julia said, losing her temper; "I can do it a great
     deal better than you can; I'm not honest, and you are, and that's a handicap."</p>
    <p>"In these cases," Rawson-Clew answered imperturbably, "honesty requires the consideration of
     the lady first and truth afterwards—a long way after. Let me know what you want told and I will
     tell it—with evidence—I suppose you are equal to evidence?"</p>
    <p>Julia laughed, but without much mirth. "I do wish you would not come," she said.</p>
    <p>But he did, and they drove together through the town, past the bulb gardens, to the wooden
     house with the dark-tiled roof. There Rawson-Clew paid the coachman and dismissed the carriage
     while Julia rang the bell.</p>
    <p>In time the servant came to the door. "Ach!" she cried at the sight of Julia, and, "G-r-r-r!"
     and other exclamations, uttered very gutturally and with upraised hands. She was a country girl
     from some remote district, and she spoke a very unintelligible patois; at least Rawson-Clew
     found it so, his companion, apparently, was used to it.</p>
    <p>Julia listened to the exclamations, and apparently to
     <pb n="148"/> congratulations on her safe return, said in a friendly manner that she had a
     terrible adventure, and then asked where Mevrouw was.</p>
    <p>Mevrouw was out, and Mijnheer was out too; a torrent more information followed, but Julia did
     not pay much attention to it, she turned to Rawson-Clew with the smile on her lips with which
     she laughed at herself.</p>
    <p>"Denah saved her money and won her move," she said; "it serves me right. I under-rated
     her—this is what always comes of under-rating the enemy."</p>
    <p>"Do you mean she knew where these people are?" Rawson-Clew asked.</p>
    <p>"That is about it, she knew and I did not."</p>
    <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>
    <p>"Wait till they come back, there is nothing else."</p>
    <p>He moved as if he thought to follow her into the house, but she did not approve of that. "You
     cannot wait with me," she said; "it is one thing to bring me home, quite another to wait with
     me here."</p>
    <p>He, however, thought differently, but he did not argue the point. "Thank you," he said, "I
     prefer to wait; I consider I am conducting this now, not you."</p>
    <p>He was a little annoyed by her ridiculous persistence, but she looked at him with the dancing
     lights coming back in her eyes. "Oh, well, if you prefer to wait," she said, "but I'm afraid
     you must do it alone." And before he realised what she was doing, she had run off, down the
     path, across an empty flower-bed and among some brushes behind.</p>
    <p>In considerable anger he turned to follow her, but he pulled himself up; there was very
     little use in that and no need for it either; he was sure she was far too skilful a tactician
     to imperil an affair by unwise flight; this was a blind merely—unless, of course, she thought
     of setting
     <pb n="149"/> out to find these Dutch people, wherever they might be. He asked the staring
     servant where her master and mistress were; it took time for him to make out her answers, but
     at last he did. Mijnheer was at a place (or house) with a name he had never before heard, and
     would have been puzzled to say now from this one hearing. It was a distant bulb farm, and
     Mijnheer had gone there on business; the fact that Julia had not returned home naturally did
     not keep the good man from his work. These details Rawson-Clew did not know; the name only was
     given to him, and that conveyed nothing. Joost, he was told, was somewhere in the bulb gardens,
     where, seemed unknown; Mevrouw was at the house of the notary. Who the notary was, and where he
     lived, and why she had gone there were alike as obscure to this inquirer as was Julia's
     probable destination. He felt that she might have set out to find any one of these three
     people, or she might be lying in wait, like a foolish child, till he had gone. He went down the
     drive; outside the gate he saw some idlers who had been there when he drove in a little while
     back; he asked them if any one answering to the girl's description had come out. They told him
     "ja," and they also told him which direction she had taken; it was the way that led to the
     market, not the residential part of the town.</p>
    <p>He was no better off for this information; there seemed nothing to be done. It would have
     been little short of absurd, if, indeed, it had not been seriously compromising to Julia, for
     him to present himself at the house of the notary—when he could find it—and tell Vrouw Van
     Heigen he had brought Julia home and she was afraid to appear with him. Either he and she must
     act together and appear together, or else he must, as she desired and now made necessary, keep
     out of it alto
     <pb n="150"/>gether. Considerably annoyed with the girl, but at the same time uneasy about her,
     he went to his hotel.</p>
    <p>As the morning wore on, the annoyance lessened and the uneasiness grew. After all he was not
     sure that Julia had thrown away much by refusing to have the support of his company; had they
     two been there waiting for the Van Heigens' return, or had they set out together to find them,
     he was not sure his presence would have been any help in the face of the jealous Dutch girl's
     accusations. A jealous woman, even an ordinarily foolish one, is a very dangerous thing when
     she is attacking a fancied rival with a chance of encompassing her overthrow. Denah would have
     got her tale told, her case proven, indignation aroused and sympathy with her before the Van
     Heigens even saw Julia. He wondered what she would do alone and wished he knew how she fared;
     he thought over the explanations possible and the various ways out that might suggest
     themselves to a fertile brain. They were not many, and they were not good; the simple truth
     would probably be best, and that would be so exceedingly compromising under the circumstances
     that the Van Heigens were hardly likely to find it palatable. Indeed, he began to see that,
     even if they two could have presented themselves, as they had first intended, to the anxious
     family before Denah arrived, it was very doubtful if the matter could have been satisfactorily
     cleared up to a suspicious and prudish Dutch mind. The girl was only a companion, a person of
     no importance, easy to replace; and, no matter how the fact might be explained, it still
     remained that she had been out all night with an unknown man; one, who, if he were known, would
     show to be of a position to make the proceeding more compromising still.</p>
    <p>At this point Rawson-Clew got up and walked to the
     <pb n="151"/> window. It was then that it struck him that he had, in these his mature years,
     committed an act of stupendous folly, the like of which his youth had never known.</p>
    <p>But the girl, what would become of the girl? In England, in ninety-nine cases out of a
     hundred, she would have been dismissed; in Holland that one last hope did not exist. She would
     be dismissed with her character considerably damaged and her chance of getting another
     situation entirely gone. What would she do? She had told him yesterday she could not leave, but
     was obliged to stay on at the Van Heigens'; although she had failed in the first object of her
     coming, and so had no motive for remaining, she had nowhere else to go. Perhaps she had
     quarrelled with her relatives; perhaps they could not afford to keep her—they were poor enough
     he knew. She had once said her eldest sister had lately married the nephew of a bishop; he
     remembered that, and he also remembered that, after his unfortunate visit to Captain
     Polkington, he had heard they were people with some good connections. But that did not mean
     that they could afford to help this girl, or would be delighted to receive her home under the
     present conditions. Rather it indicated that their position was too precarious for them to be
     able to do it. They would be bitterly hard on her—these aspiring people of gentle birth and
     doubtful shifts, clinging to society by the skin of their teeth, were the hardest of all. The
     girl could not go back to them; she could not get anything to do in Holland, or elsewhere—in
     Heaven's name what could she do?</p>
    <p>He asked himself the question with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the street. But
     the answer did not seem forthcoming.</p>
    <p>There was no good blinking the matter; the fact was obvious; the girl was hopelessly and
     utterly compromised;
     <pb n="152"/> and he, aided certainly by untoward circumstances—for the sardonic interference
     of which, in such circumstances, a man of sense usually allows—he had done it. They had had
     their "holiday," without taking thought for the morrow, in the way approved by boys and dogs
     and creatures without experience. And here was to-morrow, knocking at the door and demanding
     the price—as experience showed that it usually did. The question was, who was going to pay, he
     or she? She had taken it upon herself as a matter of course; it seemed natural to her that the
     burden should be the woman's, but it did not seem so to him; among his people it was the man
     who was expected, and who himself expected, to pay. When he had grasped the situation fully and
     saw how she must inevitably stand he also saw at the same time and equally plainly, that he
     must marry her; nothing else was possible.</p>
    <p>He walked away from the window and began to search for writing materials. He could not go and
     see her, it was out of the question under the circumstances; he would have to write, and, on
     the whole, perhaps, it was easier that way. He sat down to the table, but he did not at once
     begin, for between him and the paper there rose up the vision of a stately old Norfolk house.
     It was his; he had not lived there for years, but he supposed he would some day; all his people
     had; he remembered his grandfather there and his grandmother—a tall, stately woman, a woman of
     parts. He thought of her, and his mother, a graceful, gracious woman—he thought of her standing
     in the drawing-room between the long windows, receiving company. And then he thought of
     Julia.</p>
    <p>He turned away from the vision abruptly, and dated his letter. But soon he had lain down his
     pen again. He was conservative, and Julia was not of the breed of the women he had recalled;
     she had no kinship with them or
     <pb n="153"/> their modern prototypes, one of whom he vaguely supposed he should marry some
     day—when he went to live in the old Norfolk house. Hers was not a stately or a gracious or an
     all pervading feminine presence; she demanded no court, no care, no carpet for her way; she
     could come and go unnoticed and unattended; you could overlook her—though she never overlooked
     you or anything else. She had her points certainly, she was loyal to the core—she would be
     loyal to him, he was sure, in this scrape, with a silly wrong-headed loyalty, more like a man's
     to a woman than a woman's to a man. She was loyal to her none too reputable family—that family
     was a bitter thing to his pride of race. She was courageous, too, cheerfully enduring, laughing
     in the face of disaster, patient when action was impossible and when it was possible—he found
     himself smiling when he recalled her—surely there was never one more gay, more ready, more
     steady, more quietly alert than she when there was a struggle with men or matters in the wind.
     She had brains of a sort, there was no doubt of that; it was possible to imagine one would not
     grow tired of her undiluted company as one would of the other sort of woman. Only of course a
     man did not have the undiluted company of his wife—perhaps if he were a small shop-keeper or an
     itinerant organ-grinder—if night and day they lived together and worked together and looked out
     on the world together—if it was the simple life of which she dreamed—</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew picked up his pen and began to write; it was not a case of whether he would or
     would not, liked or disliked; he had simply to make a girl he had compromised the only
     restitution in his power.</p>
    <p>In the meantime Julia had set out for the market-place
     <pb n="154"/>as the idlers had said. But her business there did not take long and she was home
     again, as she intended, before Mevrouw got back from the Snieders. But she had not been in much
     more than five minutes before the old lady, supported by Vrouw Snieder and Denah, arrived.
     Mijnheer came home not long after, and, hearing news of the return of the truant, went to the
     house to join the others.</p>
    <p>Julia waited to receive the attack in the dim sitting-room. She knew as well as Rawson-Clew,
     or better, that she had not a ghost of a chance of clearing herself; dismissal was inevitable;
     that was why she went to the market-place. She had not largely assisted her family in living by
     their wits without having those faculties in exceeding good working order; she had already seen
     and seized the only thing open to her when the end should come. But the fact that she knew how
     it would end did not prevent her from giving battle; the knowledge only made her change her
     tactics, and, as there was no use in defending her position (and companion) she was able to
     concentrate her forces in harassing the enemy.</p>
    <p>In these circumstances it is not wonderful that Denah did not derive the satisfaction she
     expected from the affair. Julia, unrepentant and reckless because of her known fate, unhampered
     by Rawson-Clew's presence, and flatly declining to give any particulars about him, would have
     been an awkward antagonist for one cleverer than the Dutch girl. Poor Denah lost her temper,
     and lost her head, and lost control of her tongue and her tears. Julia did not lose anything,
     but again and again winged shafts that went unerringly home. She was genuinely sorry to have
     upset and disappointed Mevrouw, but for Denah she did not care in the least, and the old lady
     soon contrived to soften some of the regret, for she was far too angry and shocked at the
     impropriety to have any
     <pb n="155"/> gentler feelings of sorrow or to believe what she was told. Vrouw Snieder acted
     principally as chorus of horror; she was shocked and angry too, on Mevrouw's account and on her
     own and her daughter's; she seemed to think they had all been outraged together.</p>
    <p>When Mijnheer came in they were all talking at once and Denah was weeping copiously. Julia's
     part in the conversation was small; she just shot a word in here and there, but apparently
     never without effect, for her utterances, like drops of water on hot metal, were always
     followed by fresh bursts of excitement. The good man tried in vain to make out what was the
     matter and what had happened. At last, after his fifth effort elsewhere, he turned to Julia,
     and she told him briefly. She told the truth, only suppressing Rawson-Clew's name and all
     details concerning him, saying merely that he was a man she had met before she left England.
     The two elder sisters gradually became silent to listen; Denah listened too, only sniffing
     occasionally.</p>
    <p>"You pretended you did not know him the day we went the excursion," she said vindictively; "I
     saw you; I knew you were not to be trusted then. Why did you pretend, and how do you know him?
     He is a man of family; he has the air of it, very distinguished, and you are nothing at all,
     nobody—"</p>
    <p>"Hush!" said Mijnheer; "that is not the point; it is of no importance who the man may be, he
     is a man, that is enough; and she was out with him—alone—a whole day and night; it is certainly
     very bad indeed; shocking, if it is true—is it true?"</p>
    <p>He looked at Julia, and she answered, "Yes."</p>
    <p>She was sorry, very sorry, but more on his account than her own; she could see how heinous he
     thought it, how she had fallen in his esteem, and she was sorry for it. But
     <pb n="156"/> at the same time she knew her conduct really had been no more than indiscreet;
     and she did not repent; she regretted nothing but being found out, and that not so much as she
     ought now that the joy of battle was upon her. As for the women, they suspected far worse than
     Mijnheer believed; but even if they had not, if they had believed no more than the truth, that
     would have been enough for condemnation; her offence—the real one—was past forgiveness; she
     must go. She received the sentence meekly; she knew she deserved no less from these kind if
     narrow-minded people. Denah smiled triumphantly; Julia felt she deserved that too; moreover,
     Denah's nose was so pink and her face so swelled with tears, that the smile was more amusing
     than exasperating.</p>
    <p>"I am sorry," she said; "I am sorry you should all have to think so ill of me, and that I
     should deserve it. You have been very kind to me while I have been here, and made my service
     easy; I am ashamed to have deceived you and behaved in such a way as you must condemn."</p>
    <p>Unfortunately Vrouw Snieder snorted here; she did not believe in these protestations and she
     said so, inducing Vrouw Van Heigen to do the same. Mijnheer looked doubtfully at Julia for a
     moment, then he came to the conclusion that if she was not too abandoned a person to be really
     repentant, it would be as well to take advantage of her professed state of mind and drive home
     some moral lessons. Accordingly he and the two elder ladies drove them home, with the result
     that Julia's regret dwindled to nothing.</p>
    <p>"Mijnheer," she said at last, quietly yet effectually breaking in upon his words; "Mijnheer,
     you are a very good man, Mevrouw is a virtuous woman, and Vrouw Snieder also, all of you. I
     have often admired your goodness; when you were least conscious of it it preached
     <pb n="157"/> to me, making me ashamed of my wickedness. But now that you, in your goodness,
     have taken to preaching to me yourselves, I am no longer ashamed, for it is clear that your
     goodness dares to do a thing that no man's wickedness would; it turns the foolish and
     indiscreet into sinners and sinners into devils; it makes the way of wrong-doing very easy. You
     are so good," she went on, putting aside an interruption; "perhaps you do not know wickedness
     when you see it; you cannot distinguish between sin and sin; you are like those who would hang
     a man for stealing bread as soon as for killing a child. What! Are you indignant, Mevrouw, at
     such a charge? Are you not turning out, with no character and no chance—a good enough imitation
     of hanging—a girl who has been no more than foolish, just the same as if she had committed the
     greatest sin?"</p>
    <p>Vrouw Heigen broke in angrily, and Vrouw Snieder and Denah, inexpressibly shocked; Mijnheer
     was also shocked, but he, and they too, were vaguely uneasy under the reproach. Julia was
     satisfied; more especially as her experience of them led her to expect they would, though never
     persuaded they had made a mistake, yet feel more uneasy by and by.</p>
    <p>She rose from her chair. "Yes," she said, "it is a shame to speak of such things, as you
     observe; do not let us speak of them any more. Perhaps Mijnheer you would like to pay me, then
     I can go."</p>
    <p>Mijnheer agreed rather hastily; then, realising the suddenness of the step, he paused with
     his purse in his hand. "But can you go now?" he asked. "Nothing is arranged; you had better
     wait a day or two."</p>
    <p>"No," Julia answered, "I think not; it would be well to get the thing over and done with; you
     would rather and so would I."
     <pb n="158"/></p>
    <p>No one contradicting this, Mijnheer counted the money and gave it to Julia.</p>
    <p>"Thank you," she said; "now I will set the table for coffee drinking. You will stay, of
     course, Mevrouw," she went on, turning to Vrouw Snieder—"and Miss Denah, that will be two
     extra—Mijnheer Joost will be in, Denah; you can tell him about it."</p>
    <p>Denah flushed indignantly, and Vrouw Snieder could only say "You—You—"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I will not sit down with you, of course," Julia answered sweetly; "I will take my coffee
     in the little room; is it not so, Mevrouw?"</p>
    <p>Vrouw Van Heigen nodded; she did not know what else to do, and Julia went away, leaving them
     as awkward and at a loss for words as if they were the delinquents, not she. Denah felt this
     and resented it; the elders felt it too, and for a moment or two looked at one another ill at
     ease. However, in a little they recovered and began to talk over Julia and her wrong doings
     till they felt quite comfortable again. Denah did not join very much in the discussion; after
     she had once again, by request, repeated what she had seen and what deduced therefrom, she was
     left rather to herself. She went to the window and sat there looking out for Joost; he was
     certain to come in soon, and she found consolation in the thought. Joost, the model of modesty
     and decorous serious propriety, would know the English girl in her true colours now, and be
     justly disgusted and shocked to think that he had ever ridden beside her on a
     merry-go-round.</p>
    <p>Just then Julia passed carrying a tray of cups. "Denah," she said, pitching her voice soft
     and low in the tone the Dutch girl hated most, "I will give you a piece of advice; take care
     how you tell Joost about my wickedness; you want to be ever so clever to abuse another girl to a
     <pb n="159"/> man; it is one of the most difficult things in the world—and you are not very
     clever, you know, not even clever enough to take my advice."</p>
    <p>Denah was not clever enough to take the advice nor in any humour to do so; she stared angrily
     at Julia, who unconcernedly put the cups on the table and vanished into the kitchen.</p>
    <p>Joost came in for coffee drinking, and the whole party with one accord told him the tale;
     Julia heard them through the closed door as she sat sipping her coffee in the little room. She
     did not hear him say anything at all except just at first, "I won't believe it!" in a tone
     which roused again, and with added strength, the regret she had felt before for repaying belief
     and kindness by such disillusioning. Afterwards he seemed to say nothing more; presumably they
     had convinced him with overwhelming evidence. She wondered how he looked; she could picture his
     serious blue eyes uncomfortable well; poor Joost, who had such high opinions of her, who
     thought she, seeing the low, chose the high path always in the greatness of her knowledge and
     strength; who had called her a lantern, sometimes dimmed, but always a beacon! The lantern was
     obscured just now, very badly obscured. She rose and went up to her room; she would clear the
     table after Joost had gone back to work.</p>
    <p>She did so, coming down when he and Mijnheer were safely in the office. When she had done she
     went to Mevrouw, who had betaken herself to her room worn out by the morning's excitement.</p>
    <p>"Would you prefer that I went at once?" she inquired, "or that I waited till after dinner? I
     will stay till six if you wish it, or I will go now without waiting to attend to the
     dinner."</p>
    <p>Vrouw Van Heigen preferred the waiting; it would be
     <pb n="160"/> so very much better for the dinner, and really it hardly seemed as if propriety
     could suffer much; accordingly she said with what dignity she could that the girl had better
     stay till the evening.</p>
    <p>Julia went down-stairs again and set to work preparing the dinner, and it was perhaps only
     natural that she took pains to make that dinner a memorably good one. It was while she was busy
     in the kitchen that a note was brought to her.</p>
    <p>"Put it on the table," she said to the servant girl; her hands just then were too floury to
     take it, but she looked at it as it lay on the table beside her. She did not recognise the
     writing, though she saw at once that it was not that of a Dutchman. "Who brought it?" she
     asked, beginning to clean her hands.</p>
    <p>The servant could not say, but from her description Julia gathered that it must have been a
     special messenger of some sort. On hearing this, she did not trouble to clean her hands any
     more, but opened the letter at once, making floury finger-prints upon it.</p>
    <quote>
     <p>"<hi>Dear Miss Polkington</hi>, (it ran),</p>
     <p>"There is one subject I did not mention to you yesterday; you might perhaps have thought it
      too serious for holiday consideration; nevertheless, it is a question that I feel I must ask
      before I leave Holland. Will you do me the honour of becoming my wife? I know there is rather
      a difference in years between us, but if you can overlook the discrepancy, and consent, you
      will give me the utmost satisfaction. I honestly believe it will make for the happiness of us
      both; I have a feeling that we were meant to continue our 'excursion' together.</p>
    </quote>
    <p>"Very sincerely yours,</p>
    <p>"<hi>H. F. Rawson-Clew.</hi>"
     <pb n="161"/></p>
    <p>So Julia read, and sat down suddenly on the flour barrel. She turned to the beginning of the
     letter and read it through again, and when she looked up her eyes were shining with admiration.
     "I am glad!" she said aloud, but in English, "I am glad he has done it! It's splendid,
     splendid! I never thought of it—but then I don't believe I knew what a real gentleman was
     before!"</p>
    <p>The maidservant started at her curiously; she could not understand a word, but she saw that
     the letter gave pleasure, for which she was glad; she liked Julia, and was very sorry she was
     going in disgrace; she herself had occasional lapses from rectitude and so consequently had a
     fellow feeling.</p>
    <p>"You have a good letter?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Very good," Julia said; "but we must get on with the cooking; I will answer it by and
     by."</p>
    <p>Julia put it in her pocket after another glance, purring to herself in English, "It is so
     well done, too," she said; "never a word of to-day, only of yesterday—yesterday!" and she
     laughed softly.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt about it, if Julia had got to receive a death sentence she would have liked
     it to be well given; it is quite possible, had she lived at the time, she would have been one
     of those who objected to the indignity of riding in the tumbrils quite as much as to the
     guillotine at the end of the ride.</p>
    <p>She finished the preparations for dinner, got her pots and pans all nicely simmering and her
     oven at the right heat; then, giving some necessary directions, she left the servant to watch
     the cooking and went up to her own room. There she at once proceeded to answer the letter
     <pb n="162"/>—</p>
    <quote>
     <p>"<hi>Dear Mr. Rawson-Clew</hi>, (she wrote),</p>
     <p>"I am as glad as anything that you have done it; I never for a moment thought of it myself,
      though I ought, for it is just like you; thank you ever so much.</p>
     <p>"Please don't bother about me, I am all right and have arranged capitally."</p>
     <p>Here she turned over his letter to see how he had signed himself and, seeing, signed in
      imitation—</p>
    </quote>
    <p>"Yours very sincerely,</p>
    <p>"<hi>Julia Polkington.</hi>"</p>
    <p>"I wonder what his name is?" she speculated; "H. F.—H.—Henry, Horace—I shouldn't think he had
     a name people called him by."</p>
    <p>She read her own letter through, and as she was folding it stopped; it occurred to her that
     he might think courtesy demanded a formal refusal of his proposal. It was, of course, quite
     unnecessary; the refusal went without saying; she would no more have dreamed of accepting his
     quixotic offer than he would have dreamed of avoiding the necessity of making it; the one was
     as much a <hi>sine quâ non</hi> to her as the other was to him. From which it would appear that
     in some ways at least their notions of honour were not so many miles apart.</p>
    <p>She flattened her letter again; perhaps he would think the definite word more polite, so she
     added a postscript—</p>
    <quote>
     <p>"Of course this means no. I am sorry we can't go on with the excursion, but we can't, you
      know. The holiday is over; this is 'to-morrow,' so good-bye."</p>
    </quote>
    <p>After that she fastened the envelope, and a while later went out to post it. As she went up
     the drive she caught sight of Joost some distance away in the gardens; his face was not towards
     her, and she congratulated herself that he had not seen her. However, the congratulations were
     <pb n="163"/> premature; when she came back from the post she found him standing just inside
     the gate waiting for her, obviously waiting. At least it was obvious to her; she had caught
     people herself before now, and so recognised that she was caught too plainly to uselessly
     attempt getting away.</p>
    <p>"Do you want to hear what happened yesterday?" she asked, with an effrontery she did not
     feel. "I expect Denah has told you all, perhaps a little more than all, still, enough of it was
     true."</p>
    <p>"I want to speak to you," he said, and parted the high bushes that bordered the left of the
     drive.</p>
    <p>Julia reluctantly enough, but feeling that she owed him what explanation was possible, went
     through. Behind the bushes there was a small enclosed space used for growing choice bulbs; it
     was empty now, the sandy soil quite bare and dry; but it was very retired, being surrounded by
     an eight foot hedge with only one opening besides the way by which they had come in through the
     looser-growing bushes. Julia made her way down to the opening; with her practical eye for such
     things, she recognised that it would be the best way of escape, just as the loose-growing
     bushes offered the likeliest point of attack. This, of course, did not matter to her, she being
     in the case of "he who is down," but it might matter a good deal to Joost if his father looked
     through the bushes, and he would never know how to take care of himself.</p>
    <p>"Well?" she said, when she had taken up this discreet position. But as he did not seem ready
     she went on, "I really don't think there is anything to say; I did wrong yesterday, not quite
     as much wrong as your mother and Denah think, still wrong—what my own people would have
     disapproved, at least if it were found out; that's the biggest crime on their list—and what I
     knew your peo
     <pb n="164"/>ple would condemn utterly. I am afraid I have no excuse to offer; I knew what I
     was doing, and I did it with my eyes open. I did not see any harm in it myself but I knew other
     people would, so I meant to say nothing. I had deceived your parents before, and I meant to
     keep on doing it. You know I had walked with that man lots of times before yesterday; all the
     time your mother thought me so good to visit your cousin I really enjoyed doing it because I
     walked with him."</p>
    <p>"Do you love him?" The question was asked low and almost jerkily.</p>
    <p>"Love him?" Julia said in surprise; "no, of course not. That is where the difference comes
     in, I believe; you all seem to think there is nothing but love and love-making and kissing and
     cuddling. I have just liked talking to him and I suppose he liked talking to me, as you might
     some friend, or Denah some girl she knew. We never thought about love and all that; we
     couldn't, you know; he belongs to a different lot from what I do. Do you understand?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I understand," he answered, and there was a vibrant note in his voice which was new to
     her. "I understand that it is you who are right and we who are wrong—you who know good and evil
     and can choose, we who suspect and think and hint, believing ill when there is none. Rather
     than send you away, we should ask your forgiveness!"</p>
    <p>"You should do nothing of the kind," Julia said decidedly, beginning to take alarm. "I may
     not have been wrong in quite the way your parents think, but I was wrong all the same. I am not
     good, believe me; I am not as you are. Look at me, I am bad inwardly, and really I am what you
     would condemn and despise."</p>
    <p>She was standing in the afternoon sunlight, dark, slim,
     <pb n="165"/> alert, intensely alive, full of a twisty varied knowledge, a creature of another
     world. She felt that he must know and recognise the gulf between if only he would look fairly
     at her.</p>
    <p>He did look fairly, but he recognised only what was in his own mind.</p>
    <p>"You are to me a beacon—" he began.</p>
    <p>But she, realising at last that Denah's jealousy was not after all without foundations, cut
     him short.</p>
    <p>"I am not a beacon," she said, "before you take me for a guiding light you had better hear
     something about me. Do you know why I came here? I will tell you—it was to get your blue
     daffodil!"</p>
    <p>He stared at her speechless, and she found it bad to see the surprise and almost
     uncomprehending pain which came into his face, as into the face of a child unjustly smitten.
     But she went on resolutely: "I heard of it in England, that it was worth a lot of money—and I
     wanted money—so I came here; I meant to get a bulb and sell it."</p>
    <p>"You meant to?" he said slowly; "but you haven't—you couldn't?"</p>
    <p>"I could, six times over if I liked."</p>
    <p>"But you have not."</p>
    <p>"No. I was a fool, and you were—Oh, I can't explain; you would never understand, and it does
     not matter. The thing that matters is that I came here to get your blue daffodil."</p>
    <p>"You must have needed money very greatly," he said in a puzzled, pitying voice.</p>
    <p>"I did, I wanted it desperately, but that does not matter either—I came here to steal; I go
     away because I am found out to have deceived and to have behaved improperly—I want you to
     understand that."
     <pb n="166"/></p>
    <p>"I do not understand," he answered; "I understand nothing but that you are you, and—and I
     love you."</p>
    <p>"You don't!" she cried in sharp protest. "You do not, and you cannot! You think you love what
     you think I am. But I am not that; it is all quite different; when you, know, when you realise,
     you will see it."</p>
    <p>"I realise now," he answered; "it is still the light, only sometimes dim."</p>
    <p>"Dim!" she repeated, "it has gone out!"</p>
    <p>"And if it has, what then? If you are all you say you are, and all they say you are, and many
     worse things besides, what then? It makes no difference."</p>
    <p>He spoke with the curious quietness with which he always spoke of what he was quite sure. But
     she drew back against the hedge, clasping her hands together, her calmness all gone. "Oh, what
     have I done! What have I done!" she said, overcome with pity and remorse.</p>
    <p>He drew a step nearer, misinterpreting the emotion. "I will take care of you," he said. "Will
     you not let me take care of you?"</p>
    <p>She looked up, and though her eyes were full of tears he might have read his answer there, in
     her recovered calmness, in the very gentleness of her manner. "You cannot," she said sadly;
     "you couldn't possibly do it. Don't you see that it is impossible? Your parents, the
     people—"</p>
    <p>"That is of no importance," he answered; "my parents would very soon see you in your true
     light, and for the rest—what does it matter? If you will marry me I—"</p>
    <p>"But Joost, I can't! Don't you feel yourself that I can't? We are not only of two
     nations—that is nothing—but we are almost of two races; we are night and day, oil and water,
     black and white. It would never do; we should be on the outskirts of each other's lives, you would
     <pb n="167"/> never know mine, and though I might know yours, I could never really enter
     in."</p>
    <p>"That is nothing," he said, "if you love."</p>
    <p>"It is everything," she answered, "if two people do not talk the same language, soul
     language, I mean."</p>
    <p>"They will learn it if they love—but you do not? Is it that, tell me. Ah, yes, you do, a
     little, little bit! Only a little, so that you hardly know it, but it is enough—if you have the
     least to give that would do; I would do all the rest; I would love you; I would stand between
     you and the whole world; in time it would come, in time you would care!"</p>
    <p>He had come close to her now; in his eagerness he pressed against her, and, earnestness
     overcoming diffidence, he almost ventured to take her hand in his. She felt herself inwardly
     shrink from him with the repulsion that young wild animals feel at times for mere contact. But
     outwardly she did not betray it; pity for him kept nature under control.</p>
    <p>"I cannot," she said very gently; "I can never care."</p>
    <p>Then he knew that he had his answer, and there was no appeal; he drew back a pace, and
     because he never said one word of regret, or reproach, or pleading, her heart smote her.</p>
    <p>"I am so sorry!" she said; "I am so sorry. Oh, why is everything so hard! Joost, dear Joost,
     you must not mind; I am not half good enough for you; I'm not, indeed. Please forget me and—let
     me go."</p>
    <p>And with that she turned and fled into the house.</p>
    <p>The maidservant in the kitchen was minding the pots; it still wanted some while to dinner
     time; she did not expect the English miss would come yet, probably not till it was necessary to
     dish up. The letter, of course, would have occupied her some time; she had gone out
     <pb n="168"/> probably to meet the writer—the maid never for a moment doubted him to be the
     sharer of yesterday's escapade. She heard Julia come in, and judged the meeting to have been a
     pleasant one, as it had taken time. She had gone up-stairs now, doubtless to pack her things;
     that would occupy her till almost dinner time.</p>
    <p>It did, for she did not begin directly, but sat on her bed instead, doing nothing for a time.
     But when she did begin, she went to work methodically, folding garments with care and packing
     them neatly; her heart ached for Joost and for the tangle things were in, but that did not
     prevent her attending to details when she once set to work. At last she had everything done,
     even her hat and coat ready to put on when dinner should be over. Then, after a final glance
     round to see that she had left nothing but the charred fragments of Rawson-Clew's letter, she
     went down-stairs and got the dinner ready.</p>
    <p>She did not take her meal with the family, but again had it in the little room. She brought
     the dishes to and fro from the kitchen, however, so she passed close to Joost once or twice and
     saw his grave face and serious blue eyes, as she had seen them every day since her first
     coming. And when she looked at him, and saw him, his appearance, his small mannerisms, himself
     in fact, a voice inside her cried down the aching pity, saying, "I could not do it, I could not
     do it!" But when she was alone in the little room with the door shut between, the pity grew
     strong again till it almost welled up in tears. Poor Joost! Poor humble, earnest, unselfish
     Joost! That he should care so, that he should have set his hopes on her, his star—a
     will-o'-wisp of devious ways! That he should ache for this unworthy cause, and for it shut his
     eyes to the homely happiness which might have been his!</p>
    <p>She rose quickly and went up-stairs to get her hat and
     <pb n="169"/> jacket. Soon after, the carriage, which she had extravagantly ordered, came, and
     she called the servant to help her down with her luggage. They got it down the narrow staircase
     between them and into the hall; Julia glanced back at the white marble kitchen for the last
     time, and at the dim little sitting-room. Vrouw Van Heigen was there, very much absorbed in
     crochet; but she had left the door ajar so that she might know when Julia went, and that must
     have occupied a prominent place in her mind, for she made a mistake at every other stitch.</p>
    <p>"Good-bye, Mevrouw," Julia said.</p>
    <p>Vrouw Van Heigen grunted; she remembered what was due to herself and propriety.</p>
    <p>"And, oh," Julia looked back to say as she remembered it, "don't forget that last lot of
     peach-brandy we made, it was not properly tied down; you ought to look at the covers some time
     this week."</p>
    <p>"Ah, yes," said the old lady, forgetting propriety, "thank you, thank you, I'll see to it; it
     will never do to have that go; such fine peaches too."</p>
    <p>Then Julia went out and got into the carriage. Mijnheer was in his office; he did not think
     it quite right to come to see her start either; all the same he came to the door to tell the
     driver to be careful not to go on the grass. Joost came also and looked over his father's
     shoulder, and Julia, who had been amused at Vrouw Van Heigen, suddenly forgot this little
     amusement again.</p>
    <p>Joost left his father. "I will tell the man," he said. "I will go after him too and shut the
     gate; it grows late for it to be open."</p>
    <p>The carriage had already started, and he had to hurry after it; even then he did not catch it
     up till it was past the bend of the drive. Then the man saw him and pulled up, though it is
     doubtful if he got any order or, indeed, any
     <pb n="170"/> word. Julia had been looking back, but from the other side; and because she had
     been looking back and remembering much happiness and simplicity here, she was so grieved for
     one at least who dwelt here that her eyes were full of tears.</p>
    <p>Joost saw them when, on the stopping of the carriage, she turned. "Do not weep," he said;
     "you must not weep for me."</p>
    <p>"I am so sorry," she said; "so dreadfully sorry!"</p>
    <p>"But you must not be," he told her; "there is no need."</p>
    <p>"There is every need; you have been so kind to me, so good; you have almost taught me—though
     you don't know it—some goodness too, and in return I have brought you nothing but sadness."</p>
    <p>"Ah, yes, sadness," he said; "but gladness too, and the gladness is more than the sadness.
     Would you not sooner know the fine even though you cannot attain to it, than be content with
     the little all your life? I would, and it is that which you have given me. It is I who give
     nothing—"</p>
    <p>He hesitated as if for a moment at a loss, and she had no words to fill in the pause.</p>
    <p>"Will you take this?" he said, half thrusting something forward. "It is, perhaps, not much to
     some, but I would like you to have it; it seems fitting; I think I owe it to you, and you to
     it."</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, yes," she murmured, hardly hearing and not grasping the last words; there was
     something choking in her throat; it was this strange, humble, disinterested love, so new to
     her, which brought it there and prevented her from understanding.</p>
    <p>She stretched out her hands, and he put something into them; then he stepped back, and the
     carriage drove on. It was not till the gateway was passed that she realised
     <pb n="171"/> what it was she held—a small bag made of the greyish-brown paper used on a bulb
     farm; inside, a single bulb; and outside, written, according to the invariable custom of
     growers—</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
    <head>A REPRIEVE</head>
    <p>Rawson-Clew was reading a letter. It was breakfast time; the letter had missed the afternoon
     post yesterday, which was what the writer would have wished, and so was not delivered at the
     hotel till the morning. It was short, from the beginning—"I am so glad you have done it," to
     the end of the postscript—"this is to-morrow, so good-bye." There was not much to read; yet he
     looked at it for some time. Did ever man receive such a refusal to an offer of marriage? It was
     almost absurd, and perhaps hardly flattering, yet somehow characteristic of the writer;
     Rawson-Clew recognised that now, though it had surprised him none the less. What was to be done
     next? See the girl, he supposed, and hear what she proposed to do; she wrote that she had
     arranged "capitally," but she did not say what. He was quite certain she was not going to
     remain with the Van Heigens; if by some extraordinary accident she had been able to bring that
     about, she would certainly have told him so triumphantly. He could not think of anything
     "capital" she could have arranged; he was persuaded, either that she only said it to reassure
     him, or else, if she believed it, it was in her ignorance of the extent of the damage done
     yesterday. He must go and see her, hear what she had planned, and what further trouble she was
     thinking to get herself into, and prevent it in the only way possible; and there was
     <pb n="173"/> only one way, there was absolutely no other solution of the difficulty; she must
     marry him, and there was an end of it. He glanced at her refusal again, and liked it in spite
     of its absurdity; after all, perhaps it would have been better if he had been frank too; one
     could afford to dispense with the delicate conventions that he associated with women in dealing
     with this girl. He wished he had gone to her and spoken freely, as man to man, saying plainly
     that since they had together been indiscreet, they must together take the consequence, and make
     the best of it—and really the best might be very good.</p>
    <p>Soon after he had finished breakfast he set out for the Van Heigens' house. But as yet,
     though he had some comprehension of Julia, he had not fully realised the promptness of action
     which necessity had taught her. When he reached the Van Heigens' she had been gone some sixteen
     hours.</p>
    <p>It was Vrouw Van Heigen who told him; she was in the veranda when he arrived, and so,
     perforce, saw him and answered his inquiries. It was evident, at the outset, that neither his
     appearance nor name conveyed anything to her; she had not seen him the day of the excursion,
     and Denah's description, purposely complicated by a cross description of Julia's, had conveyed
     nothing, and his name had never transpired. He saw he was unknown, and recognised Julia's loyal
     screening of him, not with any satisfaction; evidently it was part of her creed to stand
     between a man (father or otherwise) and the consequence of his acts. That was an additional
     reason for finding her and explaining that he, unlike Captain Polkington, was not used to
     anything of the sort.</p>
    <p>"She has gone?" he said, in answer to Vrouw Van Heigen's brief information. The old lady was
     decidedly nervous of the impressive Englishman who had come
     <pb n="174"/> asking after her disgraced companion; she moved her fat hands uneasily even
     before he asked, "Where has she gone? Perhaps you would be kind enough to give me her
     address?"</p>
    <p>"I cannot," she was obliged to say; "I have not it. I do not know where she is."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew stared. "But surely," he said, "you are mistaken? She was here yesterday."</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes; I know. But she is not here now; she went last night in haste. I will tell you
     about it. You are a friend? Come in."</p>
    <p>Without waiting, she led him into the drawing-room, and there left him in some haste. The
     room struck him as familiar; he wondered why, until he remembered that it must have been
     Julia's description which made him so well acquainted with it. It was all just as she
     described; the thick, dark-coloured carpet, with the little carefully-bound strips of the same
     material laid over it to make paths to the piano, the stove, and other frequented spots. The
     highly-polished furniture, upholstered in black and yellow Utrecht velvet, the priceless
     Chinese porcelain brought home by old Dutch merchants, and handed down from mother to daughter
     for generations; the antimacassars of crochet work, the snuff-coloured wall-paper, the
     wonderful painted tiles framed in ebony that hung upon it. It was all just as she had said; the
     very light and smell seemed familiar, she must somehow have given him an idea of them too.</p>
    <p>Just then Vrouw Van Heigen came back, and her husband with her; she had been to fetch him,
     not feeling equal to dealing with the visitor alone. Mijnheer, by her request, had put on his
     best coat, but he still had his spectacles pushed upon his forehead, as they always were when
     he was disturbed in the office.
     <pb n="175"/></p>
    <p>There was a formal greeting—one never dispensed with that in Holland, then Mijnheer said,
     "You are, I suppose, a friend of Miss Polkington's father?"</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew, remembering the winter day at Marbridge, answered, "I am acquainted with
     him."</p>
    <p>Mijnheer nodded. "Yes, yes," he said; then, "it is very sad, and much to be regretted. I
     cannot but give to you, and through you to her father, very bad news of Miss Polkington. She is
     not what we thought her; she has disgraced—"</p>
    <p>But here Rawson-Clew interrupted, but in the quiet, leisurely way which was so
     incomprehensible to the Hollanders. "My dear sir," he said, "please spare yourself the trouble
     of these details; I am the man with whom Miss Polkington had the misfortune to be lost on the
     Dunes."</p>
    <p>Vrouw Van Heigen gasped; the gentle, drawling voice, the manner, the whole air of the speaker
     overwhelmed her, and shattered all her previous thoughts of the affair. With Mijnheer it was
     different; right was right, and wrong wrong to him, no matter who the persons concerned might
     be.</p>
    <p>"Then, sir," he said, growing somewhat red, "I am glad indeed that I cannot tell you where
     she is."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew looked up with faint admiration, righteous indignation, or at all events the open
     expression of it, was a discourtesy practically extinct with the people among whom he usually
     lived. He felt respect for the old bulb grower who would be guilty of it.</p>
    <p>"I am sorry you should think so badly of me," he said; "I can only assure you that it is
     without reason. You do not believe me? I suppose it is quite useless for me to say that my sole
     motive in seeking Miss Polkington is a desire to prevent her from coming to any harm?"</p>
    <p>"She will, I should think, come to less harm without
     <pb n="176"/> you than with you," Mijnheer retorted; and Rawson-Clew, seeing as plainly as
     Julia had yesterday, the impossibility of making the position clear, did not attempt it.</p>
    <p>"I hope you may be right," he said, "but I am afraid she will be in difficulties. She had
     little money, and no friends in Holland, and was, I have reason to believe, on such terms with
     her family that it would not suit her to return to England."</p>
    <p>"Ah, but she must have gone to England!" Vrouw Van Heigen cried. "She went away in a carriage
     as one does when one goes to the station to start on a journey."</p>
    <p>"She received letters from her family," Mijnheer said sturdily, "not frequently, but
     occasionally; there was not, I think, any quarrel or disagreement. She must certainly have set
     out to return home last night. If not, and if she had nowhere to go, why should she leave as
     she did yesterday? We did not say 'go!' we were content that she should remain several days,
     until her arrangements could be made."</p>
    <p>"She might not have cared for that," Rawson-Clew suggested; "if you insinuated to her the
     sort of things you did to me; women do not like that, as a rule, you know."</p>
    <p>All the same, as he said this, he could not help thinking Mijnheer right; Julia must have had
     somewhere to go. Her dignity and feelings were not of the order to lose sight of essentials in
     details, or to demand unreasonable sacrifice of common sense. She must have had some
     destination in view when she left the Van Heigens yesterday, and, as far as he could see, there
     was no destination open to her but home.</p>
    <p>Mijnheer was firmly of this opinion, although, now that a question about it had been
     suggested to him, he
     <pb n="177"/> wished he had made sure before the girl left. Of course, her plans and
     destination were no business of his—she might even have refused to give information about them
     on that account; he had dismissed her in disgrace, what she did next was not his concern. But
     in spite of her bad behaviour he had liked her; and though his notions of propriety, and
     consequent condemnation of her, had undergone no change, he was kind-heartedly anxious she
     should come to no harm. Her words about some good people making the merely indiscreet into
     sinners came back to him, but he would not apply them; Julia had gone home, he was sure of it,
     and a good thing too; the Englishman with the quiet voice and the grand manner could not follow
     her there to her detriment. Though, to be sure, it was strange that such a man as he should
     want to; he was not the kind of person Mijnheer had expected the partner in the escapade to be;
     truly the English were a strange people, very strange. His wife agreed with him on that point;
     they often said so afterwards—in fact, whenever they thought of the disgraced companion, who
     was such an excellent cook.</p>
    <p>As for Rawson-Clew, he returned to England; there was nothing to keep him longer in Holland.
     But as he was still not sure how Julia's "capital arrangement" was going to be worked out, and
     was determined to bear his share of the burden, he decided to go to Marbridge on an early
     opportunity.</p>
    <p>The opportunity did not occur quite so soon as he expected; several things intervened, so
     that he had been home more than a week before he was able to fulfil his intention. Marbridge
     lies in the west country, some considerable distance from London; Rawson-Clew did not reach it
     till the afternoon, at an hour devoted by the Polkingtons
     <pb n="178"/>most exclusively to things social. It is to be feared, however, that he did not
     consider the Polkingtons collectively at all; it was Julia, and Julia alone, of whom he was
     thinking when he knocked at the door of No. 27 East Street.</p>
    <p>The door was opened by a different sort of servant from the one who had opened it to him the
     last time he came; rather a smart-looking girl she was, with her answers quite ready.</p>
    <p>"Miss Julia Polkington was not at home," she said, and, in answer to his inquiry when she was
     expected, informed him that she did not know.</p>
    <p>"There is no talk of her coming home, sir," she said; "she is abroad, I think; she has been
     gone some time."</p>
    <p>"Since when?"</p>
    <p>The girl did not know. "In the spring, I think, sir," she said; "she has not been here all
     the summer."</p>
    <p>Then, it seemed, his first suspicion was correct; Julia had not gone home; for some reason or
     another she was not able to return.</p>
    <p>"Is Captain Polkington in?" he asked.</p>
    <p>He was not; there was no one at home now; but Mrs. Polkington would be in in about an hour.
     The maid added the last, feeling sure her mistress would be sorry to let such a visitor
     slip.</p>
    <p>But Rawson-Clew did not want to see Mrs. Polkington; she, he was nearly sure, represented the
     aspiring side of the family, not the one to whom Julia would turn in straits. The improved look
     of the house and the servant suggested that the family was hard at work aspiring just now, and
     so less likely than ever to be ready to welcome the girl, or anxious to give true news of her
     if they had any to give. Captain Polkington, who no one could connect with the ascent of the
     social ladder, might possibly know something; at all events, there was
     <pb n="179"/> a better chance of it, and he certainly could very easily be made to tell
     anything he did know.</p>
    <p>"When do you expect Captain Polkington home?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Not for a month or more, I believe, sir," was the answer; "he is in London just now."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew asked for his address; it occurred to him that Julia might have gone to her
     father; it really seemed very probable. He got the address in full, and went away, but without
     leaving any name to puzzle and tantalise Mrs. Polkington. Of course she was puzzled and
     tantalised when the maid told her of the visitor. From past experience, she expected something
     unpleasant of his coming, even though the description sounded favourable; but, as she heard no
     more of it, she forgot all about him in the course of time.</p>
    <p>It was on the next afternoon that Rawson-Clew drove to 31 Berwick Street. There are several
     Berwick Streets in London, and, though the address given was full enough for the postal
     authorities, the cabman had some difficulty in finding it, and went wrong before he went right.
     It was a dingy street, and not very long; it had an unimportant, apologetic sort of air, as if
     it were quite used to being overlooked. The houses were oldish, and very narrow, so that a good
     many were packed into the short length; the pavement was narrow, too, and so were the windows;
     they, for the most part, were carefully draped with curtains of doubtful hue. Some were further
     guarded from prying eyes by sort of gridirons, politely called balconies, though, since the
     platform had been forgotten, and only the protecting railings were there hard up against the
     glass, the name was deceptive.</p>
    <p>The hansom came slowly down the street, the driver
     <pb n="180"/>scanning the frequent doors for 31. He overlooked it by reason of the fact that
     the number had been rubbed off, but finally located it by discovering most of the numbers above
     and below. Rawson-Clew got out and rang. In course of time—rather a long time—the door was
     opened to him by the landlady—that same landlady who had confided to Mr. Gillat the
     desirability of having a good standing with the butcher.</p>
    <p>"Cap'ain Polkington?" she said, in answer to Rawson-Clew's inquiry. "I don't know whether
     he's in or not; you'd better go up and see; one of 'em's there, anyhow."</p>
    <p>She stood back against the wall, and Rawson-Clew came in.</p>
    <p>"Up-stairs," she said; "second door you come to."</p>
    <p>With that she went down to the kitchen regions; she was no respecter of persons, and she
     thanked God she had plenty of her own business to mind, and never troubled herself poking into
     other people's. Consequently, though she might wonder what a man of Rawson-Clew's appearance
     should want with her lodgers, she did not let it interfere with her work, or take the edge off
     her tongue in the heated argument she held with the milkman, who came directly after.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew found his way up the stairs; they were steep, and had rather the appearance of
     having been omitted in the original plan of the house, and squeezed in as an afterthought, when
     it was found really impossible to do without. There was no window to give light to them, or air
     either; hence, no doubt, the antiquity of the flavour of cabbage and fried bacon with hung
     about them. But Rawson-Clew, when he ascended, found the second door without trouble; there was
     not room to get lost. He knocked; he half expected to hear Julia's voice; it seemed to him
     probable that she was the person referred
     <pb n="181"/>to as "one of them." But it was a man who bade him enter, and, unless his memory
     played him false, not Captain Polkington.</p>
    <p>It was not the Captain, it was Johnny Gillat. He was reading the newspaper—Captain Polkington
     had it in the morning, he in the afternoon; he wore, or attempted to (they fell off rather
     often), very old slippers indeed, and a coat of surprising shabbiness which he reserved for
     home use. For a moment he stared at his visitor in astonishment, and Rawson-Clew apologised for
     his intrusion. "I was looking for Captain Polkington," he said. "I was told he was probably
     here."</p>
    <p>"Ah!" Mr. Gillat exclaimed, his face lighting into a smile. "Of course, of course! Captain
     Polkington's out just now, but he'll be in soon. Come in, won't you; come in and wait for
     him."</p>
    <p>He hospitably dragged forward the shabby easy-chair. "Try that, won't you?" he said. "It's
     really comfortable—not that one, that's a little weak in the legs; it ought to be put away;
     it's deceptive to people who don't know it."</p>
    <p>He pushed the offending chair against the wall, his slippers flapping on his feet, so that he
     thought it less noticeable to surreptitiously kick them off. "My name's Gillat," he went on.
     "Captain Polkington is an old friend of mine."</p>
    <p>"Mr. Gillat?" Rawson-Clew said. He remembered the name, and something Julia had said about
     the bearer of it. It was he who had given her the big gold watch she wore, and he of whom she
     had seemed fond, in a half-protecting, half-patient way, that was rather inexplicable—at least
     it was till he saw Mr. Gillat.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps," Rawson-Clew said, "you can tell me what I want to know—it is about Miss Julia
     Polkington. I met her in Holland during the summer."
     <pb n="182"/></p>
    <p>He may have thought of giving some idea of intimacy, or of explaining his interest; but, if
     so, he changed his mind; anything of the kind was perfectly unnecessary to Mr. Gillat, who did
     not dream of questioning his reason.</p>
    <p>"Ah, yes," he said; "Julia is in Holland; she has been there a long time."</p>
    <p>"Is she there still?" Rawson-Clew asked. "Can you give me her address?"</p>
    <p>"Well," Johnny said regretfully, "not exactly. But she is abroad somewhere," the last with an
     increase of cheerfulness, as if to indicate that this was something, at all events.</p>
    <p>"You don't know where she is?" Rawson-Clew inquired. "Does her father? I suppose he does—some
     one must."</p>
    <p>"No," Johnny said. "No; I'm afraid not. Certainly her father does not, nor her mother—none of
     us know; but, as you say, somebody must know—the people she is with, for instance."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew grew a little impatient. "Do you mean," he said, "that her family are content to
     know nothing of her whereabouts? Have they taken no steps to find her?"</p>
    <p>"Well, you see," Johnny answered slowly, "there aren't any steps to take. They don't want to
     find her; she is quite well and happy, no doubt, and she will come back when she is ready. Mrs.
     Polkington—do you know Mrs. Polkington? A wonderful woman! She is very busy just now, she is
     shining. Miss Chèrie is quite a belle. They really have not—have not accommodation for Julia;
     it is not, of course, that they don't want her—they have not exactly room for her."</p>
    <p>"But surely they want to know where she is?" Rawson-Clew persisted.</p>
    <p>
     <pb n="183"/></p>
    <p>"No, they don't," Johnny told him. "They know she is all right; she told them so, and told
     them she did not want to be found. They are satisfied—" He broke off, feeling that the visitor
     was more astonished than admiring of such a state of affairs. "Family emotions and sentiments,
     you know," he explained in defence of this family, "are not every one's strong point; the
     social, or the religious, or—" (he waved his hand comprehendingly) "or the national may stand
     first, and why not?"</p>
    <p>"Are you satisfied?" Rawson-Clew asked briefly.</p>
    <p>"I'd sooner be able to see her," Johnny admitted. "I'm fond of her; yes, she's been very kind
     and good; I miss seeing her. But, of course, she has her way to make in the world."</p>
    <p>"But are you satisfied that she should make it thus? That she should leave the Dutch family
     she was with and disappear, leaving no address?"</p>
    <p>"Sir," Johnny said with dignity, "I am quite satisfied, and if any one says that he is not, I
     would be pleased to talk to him."</p>
    <p>But the dignity left Mr. Gillat's manner as quickly as it came; before Rawson-Clew could say
     anything, he was apologising. "You must forgive me," he said; "I am very fond of that little
     girl; and I thought—but I had no business to think; I'm an old fool, to think you meant—"</p>
    <p>"I only meant," Rawson-Clew said, speaking with unconscious gentleness, "that I was afraid
     she might be in difficulties. She may be in trouble about money, or something."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," Johnny said cheerfully; "she has a fine head for money matters. I have sometimes
     thought, since she has been gone, that she has the best head in the family! She's all
     right—quite right; there's no need to be uneasy
     <pb n="184"/>about her. I'll show you the letter she wrote me."</p>
    <p>He opened a shabby pocket-book, and took out a letter. "There, you read that," he said.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew read, and at the end was little wiser. Julia said she had left one situation
     (reason not even suggested), and had got another. That she did not wish to give her new
     address, or to hear from Mr. Gillat, or her family, at this new place, as it might spoil her
     arrangements. Rawson-Clew recognised the last word as a favourite of Julia's; with her it was
     elastic, and could mean anything, from a piece of lace arranged to fill up the neck of a dress,
     to a complex and far-reaching scheme arranged to bring about some desired end. What it meant in
     the present instance was not indicated, but clearly she did not wish for interference, and,
     with some wisdom, took the surest way to prevent it by making it well-nigh impossible. She had
     left one means of communication, however, though apparently that was for Johnny only. "If you
     and father get into any very great muddle," she wrote, "you must let me know. Put an
     advertisement—one word, 'Johnny,' will do—in a paper; I shall understand, and, if I can, I will
     try to do something." A paper was suggested; it was a cheap weekly. Rawson-Clew remembered to
     have seen it once in the small Dutch town that summer, so it was to be got there.
     Unfortunately, as he also remembered, it was to be got in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and Paris
     and Berlin too.</p>
    <p>He folded the letter, and returned it to Mr. Gillat. "Thank you," he said; "evidently, as you
     say, she does not wish to be found, and it would seem she has got some sort of employment,
     although I am afraid it cannot be of an easy or pleasant sort."</p>
    <p>He did not explain the reason he had for thinking so, and Mr. Gillat never thought of asking.
     Soon after he went away.
     <pb n="185"/></p>
    <p>Clearly there was nothing to be done. Julia did not mean to have his help and protection;
     and, with a decision and completeness which, now he came to think of it, did not altogether
     surprise him, she has taken care to avoid them. That absurd refusal of hers was, after all, a
     reprieve, although until now he had not looked upon it in that light. No doubt it was a good
     thing affairs had turned out as they had; the marriage would have been in many ways
     disadvantageous. Yet he certainly would have insisted on it, and taken trouble to do so, if she
     had not put it altogether out of his power. All the same, he did not feel as gratified as he
     ought, perhaps because the arrogance of man is not pleased to have woman arbitrator of his
     fate, and the instinct of gentleman is not satisfied to have her bear his burden, perhaps for
     some other less clear reason. He really did not know himself, and did not try to think; there
     seemed little object in doing so, seeing that incident was closed.</p>
    <p>The next day he went north, and by accident travelled part of the way with a lady of his
     acquaintance. She was young, not more than five or six and twenty, nice looking too, and very
     well dressed. She had a lot of small impediments with her—a cloak, a dressing-bag, sunshade,
     umbrella, golf clubs—some one, no doubt, would come and clear her when the destination was
     reached; in the mean time, she and her belongings were an eminently feminine presence. She
     talked pleasantly of what had happened since they last met; she had been to Baireuth that
     summer, she told him, and spoke intelligently of the music, the technique and the beauty of it,
     and what it stood for. She was surprised to hear he had got no further than Holland, and more
     surprised still that he had not even seen Rembrandt's masterpiece while he was there. Her voice
     was smooth and even, a little loud, perhaps, from
     <pb n="186"/> her spending much time out of doors, not in the least given to those subtle
     changes of tone which express what is not said; but as she never wanted to express any such
     things, that did not matter.</p>
    <p>She did not bore him with too much conversation; she had papers with her—some three or four,
     and she glanced at them between whiles. Afterwards she commented on their contents—the
     political situation, the war (there is always a war somewhere), the cricket news, the new
     books; touching lightly, but intelligently, on each topic in turn.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew listened and answered, polite and mildly interested. It was some time since he
     had heard this agreeable kind of conversation, and since he had come in contact with this
     agreeable kind of person. He ought to have appreciated it more, as men appreciate the charm of
     drawing-rooms who have long been banished from them. He came to the conclusion that he must be
     growing old, not to prefer the society of a pretty, agreeable and well-dressed woman to an
     empty railway carriage.</p>
    <p>The girl had two fine carnations in her coat; the stalks were rather long, and so had got
     bruised. She regretted this, and Rawson-Clew offered to cut them for her. He began to feel for
     a knife in likely and unlikely pockets, and it was then that he first noticed a faint, sweet
     smell; dry, not strong at all, more a memory than a scent. He did not recognise what it was,
     nor from where it came, but it reminded him of something, he could not think what.</p>
    <p>He puzzled over it as he cut the flower stalks, then all at once he laid hold on the edge of
     a recollection—a pair of dark eyes, in which mirthful, mocking lights flickered, as the sun
     splashes flicker on the ground under trees—a voice, many-noted as a violin, that grew softest
     when it
     <pb n="187"/> was going to strike hardest, that expressed a hundred things unsaid.</p>
    <p>He looked across at the owner of the carnations, and wondered by what perversity of fate it
     was decreed that any one who could buy such good boots, should have such ill-shaped feet to put
     into them; and why, if fate so handicapped her, why she should exhibit them by crossing her
     knees. He also wondered what possessed her to wear that hat; every other well-dressed girl had
     a variation of the style that year, it was the correctest of the correct for fashion, but he
     did not take note of that. Men are rather blockheaded on the subject of fashion, and seldom see
     the charm in the innately unbecoming and unsuitable, no matter what decrees it.</p>
    <p>He looked back to the empty opposite corner, and, though until that moment he had not really
     thought of Julia since he left Mr. Gillat yesterday, he put her there in imagination now. He
     did not want her there, he did not want her anywhere (there are some wines which a man does not
     want, that still rather spoil his taste for others). She would not have made the mistake of
     wearing such a hat; her clothes were not new, they were distinctly shabby sometimes, but they
     were well assorted. As to the boots—he remembered the day he tied her shoe—he could imagine the
     man she married, if he were very young and very foolish, of course, finding a certain pleasure
     in taking her arched foot, when it was pink and bare, in the hollow of his hand. If she were in
     that corner now, the quiet, twinkling smile would certainly be on her face as she listened to
     the talk of books, and men, and places, and things. He did not picture her joining even when
     they spoke of things she knew, and places she had been to—he remembered he had once heard her
     speak of a
     <pb n="188"/>town which had been spoken of this afternoon. She had somehow grasped the whole
     life of the place, and laid it bare to him in a few words—the light-hearted gaiety and the
     sordid misery, the black superstition and the towering history which overhung it, and the
     cheerful commonplace which, like the street cries and the gutter streams, ran through it
     all—the whole flavour of the thing. The girl opposite had been to the place too; she told him
     of the historic spots she had visited; she knew a deal more about them than Julia did. She
     spoke of the quaint pottery to be bought there—it had not struck Julia as quaint, any more than
     it did its buyers and sellers. And she referred to the sayings and opinions of a great pose
     writer, who had expressed all he knew and felt and thought about it, and more besides. Julia,
     apparently, had not read him—what reading she had done seemed to be more in the direction of
      <hi>Gil Blas</hi>, and Dean Swift, and other kindred things in different languages.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic"/>
    <p>The owner of the carnations glanced out of window, and commented on the scenery, which was
     here rather fine—Julia would not have done that; all the same, she would have known just what
     sort of country they had passed through all the way, not only when it was fine; she would have
     noticed the lie of the land, the style of work done there, the kind of lives lived there, even,
     possibly, the likely difficulties in the way of railway-making and bridge building. She would
     certainly have taken account of the faces on the platforms at which they drew up, so that
     without effort she could have picked out the porter who would give the best service; the
     stranger in need of help, and he who would offer it; and the guard most likely to be useful if
     it were necessary to cheat the company—it was conceivable that cheating companies might
     sometimes be necessary in her scheme of things.</p>
    <p>He cut another piece off the carnation stalks, they were
     <pb n="189"/> still too long. He did not wish Julia there; he fancied that it was likely she
     would not easily find her place among the people he would meet at his journey's end. But if
     there were no end—if he were going somewhere else, east or west, north or south—say a certain
     old oriental town, old and wicked as time itself, and full of the mystery and indefinable charm
     of age, and iniquity, and transcendent beauty—she would like that; she would grasp the whole,
     without attempting to express or judge it. Or a little far-off Tyrolean village, remote as the
     mountains from the life of the world—she would like that; the discomfort would be nothing to
     her, the primitiveness, the simplicity, everything. If he were going to some such place—why,
     then, there were worse things than having to take the companion of the holiday too.</p>
    <p>He handed back the carnations, and then unthinkingly put his hand into his coat-pocket. His
     fingers came in contact with some dry rubbish, little more than stalks and dust, but still
     exhaling something of the fragrance which had been sun distilled on the Dunes. He recognised it
     now—Julia's flowers, put there in the wood, and forgotten until now.</p>
    <p>"Thanks so much for cutting them," said the girl with the carnations, smelling them before
     she fastened them on again. "I really think they are my favourite flower; the scent is so
     delicious—quite the nicest flower of all, don't you think so?"</p>
    <p>"I'm not sure," Rawson-Clew said thoughtfully, and when he spoke thoughtfully he drawled very
     much, "I'm not sure I don't sometimes prefer wild thyme."</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
    <head>THE YOUNG COOK</head>
    <p>It was about ten o'clock on an October night; everything was intensely quiet in the big
     kitchen where Julia stood. It was not a cheerful place even in the day time, the windows looked
     north, and were very high up; the walls and floor were alike of grey stone, which gave it a
     prison-like aspect, and also took much scrubbing, as she had reason to know. It was far too
     large a place to be warmed by the small stove now used; Julia sometimes wondered if the big one
     that stood empty in its place would have been sufficient to warm it. She glanced at it now, but
     without interest; she was very tired, it was almost bed-time, and she had done, as she had
     every day since she first joined Herr Van de Greutz's household, a very good day's work. She
     had scarcely been outside the four walls since she first came there on the day after the
     holiday on the Dunes. This had been her own choice, for, unlike all the cooks who had been
     before her, she had asked for no evenings out. Marthe, the short-tempered housekeeper, had not
     troubled herself to wonder why, she had been only too pleased to accept the arrangement without
     comment. Apart from the self-chosen confinement, the life had been hard enough; the work was
     hard, the service hard and ill-paid, and both the other inmates of the house cross-grained, and
     difficult to please. These things, however, Julia did not mind; discomfort never mat
     <pb n="191"/>tered much to her when she had an end in view; in this case, too, the end should
     more than repay the worst of her two task-masters. Which was agreeable, and almost made his
     unpleasantness desirable, as providing her intended act with a justification.</p>
    <p>She drew the coffee pot further on to the stove, and with a splinter of wood stirred the
     fire. She had the kitchen to herself, old Marthe had gone to bed; she liked going to bed early,
     with a glass of something hot, and she had soon found that the young cook could be trusted to
     finish the work down-stairs. It was her opinion that it is as well to be comfortable when you
     can, as blessings are fleeting and fickle, especially when they are cooks; so she indulged
     often both in bed and the glass, notably the glass. She had not been able to go to bed quite as
     early as she liked that day, for her master had a visitor, and there had been some trouble
     after the dinner. It was intended to be an hour later than usual to accommodate the visitor,
     but the chemist had not mentioned the fact—he seldom troubled about such trifles, expecting his
     household to divine his wishes instinctively, and resenting their failure to do so with
     indignation and some abuse. He did so to-day, and Marthe was consequently kept up later than
     she had intended, though it was Julia who came in for most of the reproof, and the trouble too;
     it was she who took away the dinner and kept it hot, and presented it afresh when the time came
     in as good condition as she could manage. There had to be a second omelet made; the first would
     not stand an hour, and so was wasted, to the indignation of Marthe. The chicken was a trifle
     dried by waiting, which called down the wrath of Herr Van de Greutz. Julia had listened to both
     of them with a meekness which was beautiful to see, albeit perhaps a little suspicious in one
     of her nature.
     <pb n="192"/></p>
    <p>She glanced up at the clock now, then rose and fetched two thick white coffee cups, and set
     them ready on a tray, and sat down again. She wondered drowsily how long Herr Van de Greutz's
     visitor would stay. He was a German, a very great scientist; the chemist looked upon him as a
     friend and an equal, a brother in arms; they talked together freely in the cryptic language of
     science, and in German, which is the tongue best fitted to help out the other. Julia heard them
     when she went to and from with the dishes at dinner time. She did not understand chemistry, a
     fact she much regretted; had she known even half as much as Rawson-Clew, the desired end would
     have been much sooner within reach. It is a very great disadvantage to have only a very vague
     idea what it is you want. But she did understand German very well, consequently part of the
     chemists' conversation was quite intelligible to her, though they did not know it. Herr Van de
     Greutz knew and cared nothing about her; he was not even aware that she was English, though, of
     course, old Marthe was.</p>
    <p>If the conversation had touched on the famous explosive at dinner time, Julia would have
     known it; she was always on the watch for some such occurrence. Unfortunately it had not,
     although, as she saw plainly, the German was the sort of man with whom Van de Greutz would
     discuss such things. She had still another chance of hearing something; she would soon have to
     take the coffee into the laboratory; they might be speaking of it then. She remembered once
     before Van de Greutz had spoken of it to a scientific guest at such a time; she had then heard
     some unenlightening technical details, which might have been of some value to a chemist, but
     were of no use at all to her ignorance. It was hard to come thus near, and yet be as far off as
     ever, but such things are
     <pb n="193"/> likely to occur when one is in pursuit of anything, Julia knew that; she was
     prepared to wait, by and by she would find out what it was she wanted, and then—</p>
    <p>A bell rang peremptorily; she hastily poured the strong black coffee into the two cups, and
     put a bottle of Schiedam on the tray. As she did so she noticed that it was nearly empty, so
     she fetched another full one, and added that to the tray. The bell did not ring again, although
     getting the second bottle had hindered her, for by this time the chemists had forgotten they
     wanted coffee. When she entered the laboratory, Herr Van de Greutz had just taken a bottle from
     the lower part of a cupboard near the door. Second shelf from the floor, five bottles from the
     left-hand corner. Julia observed the place with self-trained accuracy as she passed Herr Van de
     Greutz with the tray, which she carried to the table far down the room.</p>
    <p>"This is it," Van de Greutz said; "a small quantity only, you see, but the authorities have a
     ridiculous objection to one's keeping any large one of explosive. Of course, I have more, in a
     stone house in my garden; it is perhaps safer so, seeing its nature, and the fact that one is
     always liable to small accidents in a laboratory."</p>
    <p>Julia put down the tray, but upset some of the coffee. Seeing that excitement had not usually
     the effect of making her hand unsteady, it is possible accident had not much to do with it.
     However, it happened; she carefully wiped it up, and the two chemists, paying no more attention
     to her than if she had been a cat, went on speaking of the explosive. It was <hi>the</hi>
     explosive; their talk told her that before she had finished the wiping.</p>
    <p>"The formula I would give for it?" Van de Greutz was saying; as she sopped up the last drops,
     he gave the formula.
     <pb n="194"/></p>
    <p>She lifted the full bottle of Schiedam from the tray, and carried it away with her—in the
     hand farthest from the chemist's, certainly, but with as little concealment as ostentation.
     Near the door she glanced at the German, or rather, at what he held, the sample of the
     explosive. It was a white powder in a wide-necked, stoppered bottle of the size Julia herself
     called "quarter pint." The bottle was not more than two-thirds full, and had no mark on it at
     all, except a small piece of paper stuck to the side, and inscribed with the single letter "A."
     This may have been done in accordance with some private system of Herr Van de Greutz's, or it
     may have been for the sake of secrecy. The reason did not matter; the most accurate name would
     have been no more informing to Julia, but decidedly more inconvenient.</p>
    <p>She went out and shut the door quietly; then she literally fled back to the kitchen with the
     Schiedam. Scarcely waiting to set it down, she seized a slip of kitchen paper, and scribbled on
     it the string of letters and figures that Herr Van de Greutz had given as the formula of his
     explosive. She did not know what a formula was, nor in what relation it stood to the chemical
     body, but from the talks she had heard between the chemist and his friends, she guessed it to
     be something important. Accordingly, when he said the formula, she was as careful to remember
     it accurately as she was to remember the place of the bottle on the shelf. Now she wrote it
     down just as he spoke it, and, though perhaps not exactly as he would have written it, still
     comprehensible. She pinned the piece of paper in the cuff of her dress; it would not be found
     there if, by ill luck, she was caught and searched later on. Next she went to the kitchen
     cupboard; there were several wide-necked stoppered bottles there, doubtless without the
     chemist's knowledge, but Marthe found
     <pb n="195"/> them convenient for holding spices, and ginger, and such things. She took the one
     nearest in shape and size to the one which she had seen in the German's hand; emptied out the
     contents, dusted it and put in ground rice till it was two-thirds full. Then, with the
     lap-scissors, she trimmed a piece of paper to the right size, wrote "A" upon it, and stuck it
     to the side of the bottle with a dab of treacle—she had nothing else. She was hastily wiping
     off the surplus stickiness when the bell rang again. She finished what she was doing, and
     shrouded the bottle in a duster, so that there was another summons before she could set out.
     She took the Schiedam with her—of course it was that which was rung for, but also the bottle in
     the duster.</p>
    <p>She did not hurry. "I'll give him time to put the explosive back," she thought. It was just
     possible that it would be set on a bench, perhaps in an awkward place, but from her knowledge
     of Van de Greutz's ways she guessed not. It was also, of course, possible that the cupboard
     where it was kept would be locked; in that case, nothing could be done just now—annoying, but
     not desperate; ground rice will keep, and, apparently, explosives too, so she reflected as she
     opened the laboratory door. But the cupboard was not locked, and the bottle was back in its
     place. Another from the shelf above had been taken out; the chemists were discussing that as
     they sat smoking cigars at the table far down the room, where the coffee cups stood.</p>
    <p>"More Schiedam!" Herr Van de Greutz said, throwing the words at Julia over his shoulder. "Why
     did you bring an empty bottle?"</p>
    <p>"I am sorry, Mijnheer," Julia answered; "there was not much, I know; I have brought
     more."</p>
    <p>She pushed the door to with her foot as she spoke, and
     <pb n="196"/> with the hand not carrying the spirit set down the duster and the bottle it held
     on a chair. The German had put his coat over the chair earlier; it stood in front of the
     cupboard, a little way from it. With the true rogue's eye for cover, Julia noted the value of
     its position, and even improved it by moving it a little to the left as she knocked against it
     in passing.</p>
    <p>She brought the Schiedam to the table. "Shall I take the cups, Mijnheer?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Van de Greutz answered shortly, resenting the interruption, "and go to the devil. As I
     was saying, it is very unstable."</p>
    <p>This was to the German, and did not concern Julia; she took the tray of cups and went. But
     near the door there was an iron tripod lying on the floor; she caught her foot in it, stumbled
     and fell headlong, dropping tray and cups with a great clatter.</p>
    <p>There was a general exclamation of annoyance and anger from Van de Greutz, of surprise and
     commiseration from the German, and of something that might have been fright or pain from
     Julia.</p>
    <p>"You clumsy fool!" Van de Greutz cried. "Get out of here, and don't let me see your face, or
     hear your trampling ass-hoofs again! Do you hear me, I won't have you in here again!"</p>
    <p>The German was more sympathetic. "Have you hurt yourself?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"No, Mijnheer, nothing," Julia answered; "only a little—my knees and elbows." Had she been
     playing Othello, though she might not have blacked herself all over, it is certain she would
     have carried the black a long way below high water mark. This was no painless stage stumble,
     but one with real bruises and a real thud.</p>
    <p>The German had half risen; perhaps he thought of
     <pb n="197"/> coming to help pick up the pieces of broken cups that were scattered between the
     cupboard and the chair. But he did not do so, for Herr Van de Greutz went on to speak of his
     unstable compound.</p>
    <p>"I treated it with—" he said, and, seeing this was something very daring, the other's
     attention was caught.</p>
    <p>Julia picked up the pieces alone, and carried them out on the tray, and on the tray also she
     carried a bottle wrapped into a duster. It was a wide-necked stoppered bottle, two-thirds full
     of white powder; very much like the one she had brought in, but also very much like the one
     that stood five from the end on the second shelf of the cupboard.</p>
    <p>Soon after that she went up to her room, and took the bottle with her. Then, when she had set
     it in a place of safety, and securely locked the door, she broke into a silent laugh of
     delighted amusement. She pictured to herself Herr Van de Greutz's face when, in company with
     some other chemist, he found the ground rice, while his cook with the "ass-hoofs" carried the
     explosive to her native land.</p>
    <p>"What a thief I should make," was her own opinion of herself. "I believe I could do as well
     as Grimm's 'Master Thief,' who stole the parson and clerk." She took up the bottle and shook a
     little of the contents into her hand; she had not the least idea how it was set off, whether a
     blow, a fall, or heat would reveal its dangerous characteristics. For a little she looked at it
     with curiosity and satisfaction. But gradually the satisfaction faded; the excitement of the
     chase was over, and the prize, now it was won, did not seem a great thing. She set the bottle
     down rather distastefully, and turned away.</p>
    <p>"He could not have got the stuff," she told herself defiantly—"he" was Rawson-Clew—but the
     next moment,
     <pb n="198"/> with the justice she dealt herself, she admitted, "Because he would not get it
     this way; he is not rogue enough; while as for me—I am a born rogue."</p>
    <p>She pushed open the window and looked out, although it was quite dark, and the air pervaded
     with a cold, rank smell of wet vegetation. She was thinking of the other piece of roguery which
     she had meant to commit, and yet had not. She had the bulb, in spite of that; it was safe among
     her clothes—hers by a free gift, hers absolutely, yet as unable to be sold as the lock of a
     dead mother's hair. The debt of honour could not be paid by that. From her heart she wished she
     had not got the daffodil; she put it in the same category with Mr. Gillat's watch, as one of
     the things which made her ashamed of herself and of her life, even of this last act, and the
     very skill that had made it easy.</p>
    <p>She took up the bottle again, and for a moment considered whether she should give it back to
     Herr Van de Greutz—not personally, that would hardly be safe; but she could post it from
     England after she left his service. But she did not do so; Rawson-Clew stood in the way; it was
     for him she had taken it, and her purpose in him still stood. He wanted the explosive, it would
     be to his credit and honour to have it; the government service to which he belonged would think
     highly of him if he had it—if he received it anonymously, so that he could not tell from whence
     it came, and they could not divide the credit of getting it between him and another. He wanted
     it, and he had been good to her. He had been kind when she was in trouble; he had not believed
     her when she had called herself dishonest; he had treated her as an equal, in spite of the
     affair at Marbridge, and he had asked her to marry him when he thought she was compromised by
     the holiday in the Dunes. For a moment her
     <pb n="199"/> mind strayed from the point at issue, to that offer of marriage. She remembered
     the exact wording of the letter as if she had but just received it, and it pleased her afresh.
     She did not regret that she had refused him; nothing else had been possible. She did not want
     to marry him; albeit, when they had sat together under his coat, she had not shrunk from
     contact with him as she had shrunk from Joost when he had tried to take her hand—that was
     certainly strange. But she was quite sure she did not want to marry him; now she came to think
     about it, she could imagine that, were she a girl of his own class, with the looks, training
     and knowledge that belonged, she might have found him precisely the man she would have wanted
     to marry.</p>
    <p>She went to a drawer and took out an old handkerchief. She was not a girl of that sort—deep
     down she felt inarticulately the old primitive consciousness of inferiority and superiority, at
     once jealous and contemptuous; marrying him and living always on his plane were alike
     impossible to her, but she could give him the explosive. There was not one girl among all those
     others who could have got it and given it to him!</p>
    <p>She tore a piece from the handkerchief, and fastened it over the stopper of the bottle; then
     she got out a hat trimmed with bows of wide ribbon, and sewed the bottle into the centre bow.
     It presented rather a bulgy appearance, but by a little pulling of the other trimming it was
     hardly noticeable, and really nothing is too peculiar to be worn on the head. After that she
     went to bed.</p>
    <p>There was trouble in Herr Van de Greutz's kitchen the next day; the young cook, who had
     behaved so admirably before, did what old Marthe called "showing the cloven
     <pb n="200"/>hoof." She was impertinent, she was idle; she broke dishes, she wasted eggs, and
     she lighted a roaring fire in the big stove, in spite of the strict economy of fuel which was
     one of the first rules of the household. Finally she announced that she must have a day's
     holiday. Marthe refused point blank, whereupon the cook said she should take it, and a dispute
     ensued; Marthe called her several names, and reminded her of the fact that she had no
     character, and that she had confessed to being obliged to leave the Van Heigens in haste. Julia
     retorted that that fact was known to the housekeeper when she engaged her, and was the reason
     of the starvation wage offered. Marthe then inquired what enormity it was that she had
     committed at the Van Heigens', and intimated that it must be disgraceful indeed for a person,
     pretending to be a lady-help, to be thankful to accept the situation of cook. Julia's answer
     was scarcely polite, and very well calculated to rouse the old woman further, and, at the same
     time, she opened the door and skilfully worked herself and her antagonist into the passage, and
     some way up it, raising her voice so as to incite the other to raise hers. The result was that
     soon the noise reached Herr Van de Greutz.</p>
    <p>Out he came in a great rage, ordering them about their business, and abusing them roundly.
     Marthe hurried back to the kitchen, effectually silenced, but Julia remained; she had not got
     her dismissal yet, and it was imperative she should get it, for there was no telling when the
     ground rice would be discovered. But she soon got what she wanted; after a very little more
     inciting, Herr Van de Greutz ordered her out of his house a great deal more peremptorily than
     she had been ordered out of the Van Heigens'. She was to go at once; she was to pack her things
     and go, and Marthe was to see that she took nothing but what was her own; she was the most un
     <pb n="201"/>trustworthy and incompetent pig that the devil ever sent to spoil good food, and
     steal silver spoons.</p>
    <p>To this Julia replied by asking for her wages. At first Van de Greutz refused; but Julia,
     with some effrontery, considering the circumstances, declined to go without them, so eventually
     he thought better of it and paid her. After that she and Marthe went up-stairs, and she packed
     and Marthe looked on, closely scrutinising everything. When all was done, and she herself
     dressed, she walked out of the house, with the formula fastened inside her cuff, and the
     explosive balanced on her head. And the old man who did the rough work about the place came
     with her, wheeling her luggage on a barrow as far as the gate. Here he shot it out, and left
     her to wait till she might hail some passing cart, and so get herself conveyed to the town.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
    <head>THE HEIRESS</head>
    <p>There was a fog on the river and while the tide was low no craft moved; but with its rising
     there came a stir of life, the mist that crept low on the brown water became articulate with
     syren voices and the thud of screws and the wash of water churned by belated boats. The
     steamers called eerily, out of the distance a heart-broken cry like no other thing on earth,
     suddenly near at hand a hoot terrific; but nothing was to be seen except rarely when out of the
     yellow impenetrableness a hull rose abruptly, a vague dark mass almost within touching
     distance. Julia stood on deck and listened while the little Dutch boat crept up; she found
     something fascinating in this strange, shrouded river, haunted, like a stream of the nether
     world, with lamentable bodiless voices. The fog had delayed them, of course; the afternoon was
     now far advanced; they had been compelled to wait some long time while the tide was down, and
     even now that it was coming up, they could go but slowly. The last through train to Marbridge
     would have left Paddington before the Tower Stairs were reached; but Julia did not mind that;
     she would go to Mr. Gillat; she could get a room at the house where he lodged for one night;
     she was glad at the thought of seeing Johnny again. Johnny, who knew the worst and loved and
     trusted still.</p>
    <p>Gradually the fog lifted, not clearing right away, but
     <pb n="203"/> enough for the last of the sunset to show smoky, rose in a wonderful tawny sky.
     All the russet-brown water kindled, each ripple edge catching a gleam of yellow, except to the
     eastward, where, by some trick of light, the main stream looked like a pool of dull silver, all
     pale and cold and holy. The wharves and factories on the banks revealed themselves, heavy black
     outlines, pinnacled with chimneys like some far-off spired city. All the craft that filled the
     river became clear too, those that lay still waiting repairs or cargo or the flood of the
     incoming tide, and those that moved—the black Norwegian timber boats, the dirty tramp steamers
     from far-off seas, the smooth grey-hulled liners, the long strings of loaded barges, that
     followed one another up the great waterway like camels in a desert caravan. Julia stood on deck
     and watched it all, and to her there seemed a certain sombre beauty and a something that moved
     her, though she could not tell why, with a curious baseless pride of race. And while she
     watched, the twilight fell, and the colours turned to purple and grey, and the lights twinkled
     out in the shipping and along the shore—hundreds and hundreds of lights; and gradually, like
     the murmur of the sea in a shell, the roar of the city grew on the ear, till at last the little
     boat reached the Stairs, where the old grey fortress looks down on the new grey bridge, and the
     restless river below.</p>
    <p>A waterman put Julia ashore, after courtesies from the Custom House officers, and a porter
     took her and her belongings to Mark Lane station, from whence it was not difficult to get
     approximately near Berwick Street.</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat was not expecting visitors; he had no reason to imagine any one would come to see
     him; he did not imagine that the rings at the front bell could concern him; even when he heard
     steps coming up-stairs he only
     <pb n="204"/> thought it was another lodger. It was not till Julia opened the door of the back
     room he now occupied that he had the least idea any one had come to see him.</p>
    <p>"Julia!" he exclaimed, when he saw her standing on the threshold. "Dear, dear, dear me!"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Julia said, "it really is I. I'm back again, you see;" and she came in and shut the
     door.</p>
    <p>"Bless my soul!" Johnny said; "bless my soul! You're home again!"</p>
    <p>"On my way home; I can't get to Marbridge to-night very comfortably, and I wanted to see you,
     so here I am. I have arranged with your landlady to let me have a room."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat appeared quite overcome with joy and surprise, and it seemed to Julia, nervousness
     too. He led her to a chair; "Won't you sit down?" he said, placing it so that it commanded a
     view of the window and nothing else.</p>
    <p>Julia sat down; she did not need to look at the room; she had already mastered most of its
     details. When she first came in she had seen that it was small and poor—a back bedroom, nothing
     more; an iron bed, not too tidy, stood in one corner, a washstand, with dirty water in the
     basin, in another. There was a painted chest of drawers opposite the window; one leg was
     missing, its place being supplied by a pile of old school-books; the top was adorned with a
     piece of newspaper in lieu of a cover, and one of the drawers stood partly open; no human
     efforts could get it shut, so Mr. Gillat's wardrobe was exposed to the public gaze—if the
     public happened to look that way. Julia did not; nor did she look towards the fire-place, where
     a very large towel-horse with a very small towel upon it acted as a stove ornament—plain proof
     that fires were unknown there. She looked across Mr. Gillat's
     <pb n="205"/> cheap lamp to the window and the vista of chimney pots, which were very well in
     view, for the blind refused to come down and only draped the upper half of the window in a
     drooping fashion.</p>
    <p>Johnny stood against the chest of drawers, striving vainly to push the refractory drawer
     shut, although he knew by experience it was quite impossible. She could see him without turning
     her head; he was shabbier than ever; even his tie—his one extravagance used to be gay ties—was
     shabby, and his shoes would hardly keep on his feet. His round pink face was still round and
     pink; he did not look exactly older, though his grizzled little moustache was greyer, only
     somehow more puzzled and hurt by the ways of fate. Julia knew that that was the way he would
     age; experience would never teach him anything, although, as she suddenly realised, it had been
     trying lately.</p>
    <p>She turned away from the window; "I have left my luggage at the station," she said; "I got
     out what I wanted in the waiting-room and brought it along in a parcel. I think I'll take it to
     my room now, if you don't mind, and wash my face and get rid of my hat—it is very heavy. I
     shan't be long."</p>
    <p>She rose as she spoke, and Johnny bustled to open the door for her, too much a gentleman, in
     spite of all, to show he was glad to have her go and give him a chance to clear up. At the door
     she paused.</p>
    <p>"You need not order supper, Johnny," she said; "I've seen about that."</p>
    <p>Johnny stopped, his face a shade pinker. "Oh, but," he protested, "you shouldn't do that; you
     mustn't do that. I'll tell Mrs. Horn we won't have it; I'll make it all right with her; I was
     just going out to get a—a pork pie for myself."
     <pb n="206"/></p>
    <p>It is to be feared this statement was no more veracious than Julia's, and certainly it was
     not nearly so well made; it would not have deceived a far less astute person than she, while
     hers would have deceived a far more astute person than he.</p>
    <p>"A pork pie?" Julia said. "You have no business to eat such things in the evening at your
     time of life. I tell you I have settled supper; we had much better have what I have got. I
     could not bring you a present home from Holland; I left in a hurry, so I have bought supper
     instead. It is my present to you—and myself—I have selected just what I thought I could eat
     best; one has fancies, you know, after one has been seasick."</p>
    <p>It would require an ingeniously bad sailor to be seasick while a Dutch cargo boat crept up
     the Thames in a fog, but Julia never spared the trimmings when she did do any lying. Johnny was
     quite satisfied and let her go to take off her hat—and the precious explosive which she still
     carried in it.</p>
    <p>While she was gone he tidied the room to the best of his ability. He regretted that he had
     nowhere better to ask her; if he had the sitting-room he occupied when Rawson-Clew came in
     September, he would have felt quite grand. But that was a thing of the past, so he made the
     best of circumstances and went to the reckless extravagance of sixpenny worth of fire. When
     Julia came in, the towel-horse had been removed from the fender, and a fire was sputtering
     awkwardly in the grate, while Mr. Gillat, proud as a school-boy who has planned a surprise
     treat, was trying to coax the smoke up the damp chimney.</p>
    <p>"Johnny!" Julia exclaimed, "what extravagance! It's quite a warm night, too!"</p>
    <p>Johnny smiled delightedly. "I thought you'd be cold
     <pb n="207"/> after your journey; you look quite pale and pinched," he said; "seasickness does
     leave one feeling chilly."</p>
    <p>Julia repented of that unnecessary trimming of hers. "It is nice to have a fire," she said,
     striving not to cough at the choking smoke; "I don't need it a bit, but I don't know anything I
     should have enjoyed more; why, I haven't seen a real fire since I left England!"</p>
    <p>She broke off to take the tongs from Mr. Gillat, who, in his efforts to improve the draught,
     had managed to shut the register. She opened it again, and in a little had the fire burning
     nicely. Johnny looked on and admired, and at her suggestion opened the window to let out the
     smoke. After that she managed to persuade the blind down, and, what is more, mended it so that
     it would go up again; then Mr. Gillat cleared the dressing-table and pulled it out into the
     middle of the room, and by that time supper was ready—fried steak and onions and bottled beer,
     with jam puffs and strong black coffee to follow—not exactly the things for one lately
     suffering from seasickness, but Julia tried them all except the bottled beer and seemed none
     the worse for it. And as for Johnny, if you had searched London over you could have found
     nothing more to his taste. He was a little troubled at the thought of what Julia must have
     spent, but she assured him she had her wages, so he was content. Seldom was one happier than
     Mr. Gillat at that supper, or afterwards, when the table was cleared and they drew up to the
     fire. They sat one each side of the fender on cane-seated chairs, the coffee on the hob, and
     Johnny smoking a Dutch cigar of Julia's providing. One can buy them at the railway stations in
     Holland, and she had scarcely more pleasure in giving them to Johnny than she had in smuggling
     home more than the permitted quantity.</p>
    <p>"Now tell me about things," Julia said.
     <pb n="208"/></p>
    <p>Johnny's face fell a little. During supper they had talked about her affairs and experiences,
     none of the unpleasant ones; she was determined not to have the supper spoiled by anything.
     Now, however, she felt that the time had come to hear the other side of things.</p>
    <p>"I suppose father has been to town?" she remarked; she knew only too well that nothing else
     could account for Mr. Gillat's reduced circumstances. "When did he go?"</p>
    <p>"He has not been gone much more than a week," Johnny said; "think of that now! If he'd stayed
     only a fortnight more he'd have been here to-night; it is a pity!"</p>
    <p>"I don't think it is at all," Julia said frankly; "the pity is he ever came."</p>
    <p>Johnny rubbed his hand along his chair. "Well, well," he said, "your mother wished it; she
     knows what she is about; she is a wonderful woman, a wonderful woman. I did what you told me, I
     really did."</p>
    <p>Julia was sure of that, but she was also sure now that he had not been a match for her
     mother.</p>
    <p>"I went down to Marbridge a week before your father was supposed to be coming to town; I
     warned him very likely I should have to go away, just as you said—and the very day I went to
     Marbridge he came to town, the very day—a week earlier than was talked of."</p>
    <p>Julia could not repress an inclination to smile, not only at the neat way in which her mother
     had checkmated her, but also at the thought of that lady's face when Mr. Gillat presented
     himself at Marbridge, just as she was congratulating herself on being rid of the Captain.</p>
    <p>"What happened?" she asked. "Did mother send you back to town again?"</p>
    <p>"She did not send me," Mr. Gillat answered; "but, of course, I had to go, as she said; there
     was your father all alone here; it would be very dull for him; I couldn't
     <pb n="209"/> leave him. Besides, he is not—not a strong man, it would be better—she would feel
     more easy if she thought he had his old friend with him, to see he didn't get into—you
     know."</p>
    <p>"I know," Julia answered; "mother told you all this, then she paid your fare back again."</p>
    <p>"Not paid my fare," Mr. Gillat corrected; "a lady could not offer to do such a thing; do you
     think I would ever have allowed it? I couldn't you know."</p>
    <p>Julia's lips set straight; she had something of a man's contempt for small meannesses, and it
     is possible her judgment on this economy of her mother's was harder than any she had for the
     unjustifiable extravagances at which she guessed. She did not say anything of it to Mr. Gillat,
     she was too ashamed; not that he saw it in that light; he didn't think he had been in any way
     badly used, he never did.</p>
    <p>"Well," she said, "then you came back to town and looked after father to the best of your
     abilities? I suppose you could not do much good?"</p>
    <p>Johnny rubbed his hand along his chair again for a little. "You see," he said hesitatingly,
     "it was very dull for him; of course he wanted amusement."</p>
    <p>"And of course he had it, though he could not afford it, and you paid?"</p>
    <p>"Not to any great extent; oh, dear no, not to any great extent."</p>
    <p>"No, because you had not got 'any great extent' to spend; what you had, limited the amount, I
     suppose, nothing else."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat ignored this. "Your father," he said, rather uneasily, looking at her and then
     away again, "your father never had a very strong head, he—you know—he—"
     <pb n="210"/></p>
    <p>"Has taken to drink?" Julia asked baldly. "As well as gambling he drinks now?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," Johnny said quickly, "not exactly, that is—he does take more than he used, more
     than is good for him sometimes; not much is good for him, you know—he does take more, it is no
     good pretending he does not. But it was very dull for him; it did not suit him being here, I
     think; he used to get so low in spirits, what with his losses and feeling he was not wanted at
     home. He thinks a great deal of your mother, and he could not but feel that she does not think
     much of him to send him away like that; it hurt him, although, as he said to me more than once,
     no doubt he deserved it. It preyed on his mind; he seemed to want something to cheer him."</p>
    <p>Julia nodded; she could understand the effect well enough, though the causes at work might
     not be quite clear. To her young judgment it seemed a little strange that her father should
     have never realised what a cumberer of the ground he was to his wife until she banished him
     "for his health." But so it evidently was, and after all she could believe it; like some others
     he had "made such a sinner of his conscience," that he could believe, not only his own lie, but
     the legends woven about him. They had all pretended things, he and they also; his position,
     too, had come gradually, he had got to accept it without thinking before it was an established
     fact. But now the truth had been brought home to him—more or less—and he was miserable, and,
     according to the custom of his sort, set to making bad worse as soon as ever he discovered
     it.</p>
    <p>"Why did he go home last week?" she aroused herself to ask.</p>
    <p>"He thought it his duty," was Johnny's surprising answer. "No, Mrs. Polkington did not send
     for him, she
     <pb n="211"/> did not know he was coming; he decided for himself, he felt it would be
     better."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat rambled on vaguely, but Julia was not slow to guess that the principal reason was
     to be found in the state of Johnny's finances. She questioned him as to when he had moved into
     the back room, and, finding it to be not long before her father's departure, guessed that
     discomfort, like the husks of the prodigal son, had awakened the thing dignified by the name of
     duty.</p>
    <p>For a little she sat in silence, thinking matters over. Johnny smoked hard at the stump of
     his cigar, mended the fire and fidgeted, looking sideways at her.</p>
    <p>"Don't worry about it," he ventured at last; "things'll look up, they will; when he's back at
     Marbridge with your mother he'll be all right. She always had a great influence over him, she
     had, indeed."</p>
    <p>Julia said "Yes." But he did not feel there was much enthusiasm in the monosyllable, so he
     cast about in his mind for something to cheer her and thus remembered a very important
     matter.</p>
    <p>"What an old fool I am!" he exclaimed. "There's something I ought to have told you the moment
     you came in, and I've clean forgotten it until now; it's good news, too! There is a lawyer
     wants to see you."</p>
    <p>"What about?" Julia asked; she did not seem to naturally associate a lawyer with good
     news.</p>
    <p>"A legacy," Johnny answered triumphantly.</p>
    <p>Julia was much astonished; she could not imagine from whence it came, but before she asked
     she made the business-like inquiry, "How much?"</p>
    <p>"Not a great deal, I'm afraid," Mr. Gillat was obliged to say; "still, a little's a help, you
     know; it may be a great help; you remember your father's Aunt Jane?"</p>
    <p>Julia did, or rather she remembered the name. Great
     <pb n="212"/>-aunt Jane was one of the relations the Polkingtons did not use; she was not rich
     enough or obliging enough to give any help, nor grand enough for conversational purposes. She
     never figured in Mrs. Polkington's talk except vaguely as "one of my husband's people in
     Norfolk;" this when she was explaining that the Captain came of East Anglian stock on his
     mother's side. Jane was only a step-aunt to the Captain; his mother had married above her
     family, her half-sister Jane had married a little beneath—a small farmer, in fact, whose
     farming had got smaller still before he died, which was long ago. Great-aunt Jane could not
     have much to leave any one, but, as Mr. Gillat said, anything was better than nothing; the real
     surprise was why it should have been left to Julia.</p>
    <p>She asked Johnny about it, but he could not tell her much; he really knew very little except
     that there was something, and that the lawyer wanted her address and was annoyed when her
     relations could not give it. Indeed, even went so far as to think they would not, and that it
     would be his duty to take steps unless she was forthcoming soon.</p>
    <p>"I had better go to his office to-morrow," Julia said; "I suppose you know where it is?"</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat did, and they arranged how they would go to-morrow, Johnny, who was to wait
     outside, solely for the pleasure and excitement of the expedition. After that they talked about
     the legacy and its probable amount for some time.</p>
    <p>"I suppose no other benefactor came inquiring for me while I was away?" Julia said, after she
     had, to please Johnny and not her practical self, built several air castles with the
     legacy.</p>
    <p>"No," Mr. Gillat said regretfully, "I'm afraid not; no
     <pb n="213"/> one else asked for you. At least, some one did; a Mr. Rawson-Clew came here for
     your address."</p>
    <p>"Did he though?" Julia asked; "Did he, indeed? What did he want it for?"</p>
    <p>"Well, I don't know," Johnny was obliged to say; "I don't know that he gave any reason
     exactly; he said he had met you in Holland. I thought he was a friend of yours, he seemed to
     know a good deal about you."</p>
    <p>"He was a friend," Julia said; "that was quite right. And so he came for my address. When was
     this?"</p>
    <p>Johnny gave the approximate date, and Julia asked: "Why did he come to you?"</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat did not quite know unless it was because he had failed elsewhere. "But he really
     came to see your father," he said.</p>
    <p>"Did he see him?" Julia inquired.</p>
    <p>"No, he was out. To tell the truth, I don't believe your father ever knew he came," Johnny
     confessed; "I meant to tell him, of course, but he was late home that day, and when he came he
     was—was—well, you know, he couldn't—it didn't seem—"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Julia, coming to the rescue, "he was drunk and could not understand, and
     afterwards you forgot it; it does not matter; indeed, it is better so; I am glad of it."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat was fumbling in his shabby letter-case; he took out a card; it bore Rawson-Clew's
     name and address of a London club.</p>
    <p>"He gave me this," he said, "and told me to let him know if I heard from you, if you were in
     any trouble, or anything—if I thought you were."</p>
    <p>Julia held out her hand. "You had better give it to me," she said; "I'll let him know all
     that is necessary. Thank you;" and she put the card away.
     <pb n="214"/></p>
    <p>Soon after she went to her room, for it was growing late. But she did not hurry over
     undressing; indeed, when she sat down to take off her stockings, she paused with one in her
     hand, thinking of Rawson-Clew. So he had tried to find out where she was; he did not then
     accept her answer as final; he was bent on seeing that she came to no harm through
     him—honourable, certainly, and like him. He had come to Berwick Street and nearly seen her
     father—drunk; quite seen Mr. Gillat, in the first floor sitting-room certainly, but no doubt
     shabby and not very wise as usual. She was not ashamed; though for a moment she had been glad
     he had missed her father; now she told herself it did not matter either way. He knew what she
     was and what her people were; what did it matter if he realised it a little more? They were not
     of his sort, it was no good pretending for a moment that they were. His sort! She laughed
     silently at the thought. The girls of his sort eating steak and onions in a back bedroom with
     Johnny Gillat! Caring for Johnny as she cared, liking to sit with him in the pokey little room
     while he smoked Dutch cigars; not doing it out of kindness of heart and charity, but finding
     personal pleasure in it and a sense of home-coming! If Rawson-Clew had come that evening while
     they were at supper, or while she cured the smoky fire or mended the blind, or while they
     sipped black coffee out of earthenware breakfast-cups and talked of her father's delinquencies!
     It would not have mattered; he knew she was of the stoke-hole—she had told him so—and not like
     the accomplished girls whom he usually met—who could not have got him the explosive!</p>
    <p>She dropped her stocking to take the wide-necked bottle in her hands, deciding now how best
     to send it. It must go by post, in a good-sized wooden box, tightly packed, with a great deal
     of damp straw and wool; it
     <pb n="215"/> ought to be safe that way. She would send it to the club address, it was
     fortunate she had it; but not yet, not until her own plans were clearer. It was just possible
     he might suspect her; it was hardly likely, but it was always as well to provide against remote
     contingencies, for if he tried and succeeded in verifying the suspicion everything would be
     spoiled. He had made sensible efforts to find her before, he might make equally sensible and
     more successful ones again, unless she left a way of escape clear for herself. Accordingly, so
     she determined, the explosive should not go yet, thought it had better be packed ready. She
     would get a box and packing to-morrow; to-night she could only copy the formula. She did this,
     printing it carefully on a strip of paper which she put on the bottle and coated with wax from
     her candle. She knew Herr Van de Greutz waxed labels sometimes to preserve them from the damp,
     so she felt sure the formula would be safe however wet she might make the packing.</p>
    <p>The next day she went to the lawyer's office and heard all about the legacy and what she must
     do to prove her own identity and claim it. Mr. Gillat waited outside, pacing up and down the
     street, striving so hard to look casual that he aroused the suspicions of a not too acute
     policeman. The official was reassured, however, when Julia came out of the office and carried
     Johnny away to hear about the legacy.</p>
    <p>"It is more than I thought," she said, before they were half down the street. "Fifty pounds a
     year, a small house—not much more than a cottage—and a garden and field; that's about what it
     comes to. The house is not worth much; it is in an unget-at-able part of Norfolk, in the sandy
     district towards the sea—the man spoke as if I knew where that was, but I don't—and the garden and
     <pb n="216"/> field are not fertile. I don't suppose one could let the place, but one could
     live in it, if one wanted to."</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes," Johnny said, "of course; you will have your own estate to retire to; quite an
     heiress—your mother will be pleased."</p>
    <p>Julia could well imagine what skilful use her mother could make of the legacy; it would
     figure beautifully in conversation; no doubt Johnny was really thinking of this also, though he
     did not know it, for actually the thing would not commend itself to Mrs. Polkington so highly
     as a lump sum of money would have done.</p>
    <p>"Why do you think Great-aunt Jane let it to me?" Julia asked. "Because I went out to work! It
     seems that father and we three girls are the nearest relations she had, and though we knew
     nothing about her, she made inquiries about us from time to time. When she heard I had gone
     abroad as companion or lady-help, she said she should leave all she had to me because I was the
     only one who even tried to do any honest work. You know that is not really strictly fair,
     because I did not altogether go with the idea of doing honest work; although, certainly, when I
     got there I did it."</p>
    <p>Johnny did not quite follow this last, but it did not matter, the only thing that concerned
     him—or Julia much, either—was the fact that she was the possessor of £50 a year, a cottage, a
     garden, and a field. Johnny revelled in the idea and talked of what she was going to do right
     up to the time that he saw her into the train at Paddington. The only thing that put an end to
     his talking was the guard requesting him to stand away from the carriage door and Julia
     admonished him to leave go of the handle before the engine started. Julia herself did not talk
     so much of what she would do because she did not know; she felt, until she got home and saw how
     things were there,
     <pb n="217"/> it was no good even to plan how and when to spend. Five pounds she did spend; it
     was really her saving accumulated by economy in Holland, but she reckoned it as drawn from her
     estate. Johnny found it in an envelope when he returned to the back bedroom, and with it a note
     to say that it was in part payment of Captain Polkington's debts, for which, of course, his
     family were responsible; "and if you make a fuss about it," the letter concluded, dropping the
     business-like style, "I shall trim 'Bouquet' to stink next time you come to Marbridge, and not
     come and sit with you."</p>
    <p>I think Johnny sat down and wept over that letter; but then he was rather a silly old man and
     he had not had a good meal, except last night's steak and onions, for a fortnight.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
    <head>THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN</head>
    <p>The great Polkington campaign was over and it had failed. Mrs. Polkington and Chèrie cheered
     each other with assurances of a contrary nature as long as they could, but for all that it had
     really failed and they knew it. There had been some small successes by the way; they had
     received a little recognition in superior places, and a few, a very few, invitations of a
     superior order at the cost, of course, of refusing and so offending some old friends and
     acquaintances. It might perhaps have been possible to achieve the position at which Mrs.
     Polkington aimed in the course of time, or a very long time; society in the country moves
     slowly, and she could not afford to wait indefinitely; her financial ability was not equal to
     it. Moreover, there came into her affairs, not exactly a crash, but something so unpleasantly
     like a full stop that she and Chèrie could not fail to perceive it. This occurred on the day
     when they heard of Mr. Harding's engagement. Mr. Harding was the eligible bachelor addition to
     county society whose advent had materially assisted in giving definite form to Mrs.
     Polkington's ambition. He had helped to feed it, too, during the late summer and early autumn,
     for he had been friendly, though Chèrie was forced to admit that his attentions to her had not
     been very marked. But now the news was abroad that he was engaged to a girl in his own circle;
     <pb n="219"/> one whose mother had not yet extended any greater recognition to Mrs. Polkington
     than an invitation to a Primrose League Fête.</p>
    <p>This news was abroad in the middle of October, and there was a certain amount of unholy
     satisfaction in Marbridge. Some of the old friends and acquaintances who Mrs. Polkington had
     offended, recognised the Christian duty of forgiveness, and called upon her—to see how she bore
     up. The Grayson girls, whose dance Chèrie had refused at the beginning of the month, came to
     see her. But they put off their call a day to suit some theatrical rehearsal; by which means
     they lost the entertainment they promised themselves, for by the time they did come Chèrie was
     ready for them and, with appropriate shyness, let it be known that she herself was engaged to
     Mr. Brendon Smith.</p>
    <p>At this piece of information the girls looked at one another, and neither of them could think
     of anything smart to say. Afterwards they told each other and their friends that it was "quick
     work," and "like those Polkingtons." But at the time they could only offer suitable
     congratulations to Chèrie, who received them and carried off the situation with a charming
     mingling of assurance and graciousness, which was worthy of her mother.</p>
    <p>But the Graysons were right in saying it was quick work; late one afternoon Chèrie heard of
     Mr. Harding's engagement; during the evening she and her mother recognised their failure; in
     the night she saw that Mr. Brendon Smith was her one chance of dignified withdrawal, and before
     the next evening she had promised to marry him.</p>
    <p>There were some people in Marbridge who pitied Mr. Smith (only the Polkingtons put in the
     Brendon), but he did not need much pity, for the good reason that he
     <pb n="220"/> knew very well what he was doing and how it was that his proposals came to be
     accepted. He was fond of Chèrie, and appreciated both her beauty and her several valuable
     qualities; but he had no illusions about her or her family, and he knew, when he made it, that
     his proposal would be accepted to cover a retreat. He was not at all a humble and diffident
     individual, but he did not mind being taken on these terms; he even saw some advantage in it in
     dealing with the Polkingtons. If there was any mistake in the matter it was Chèrie when she
     said "Yes" to his suggestion, "Don't you think you'd better marry me?" She probably did not
     know how completely she was getting herself a master.</p>
    <p>It was not a grand engagement; Mrs. Polkington could not pretend that her son-in-law elect
     had aristocratic or influential connections; she said so frankly—and her frankness, which was
     overstrained, was one of her most engaging characteristics.</p>
    <p>"It is no use pretending that I should not have been more pleased if he had been better
     connected," she said to those old friends and acquaintances whose Christianity led them to
     call. "I share your opinion, dear Mrs. ——" (the name varied according to circumstances) "about
     the value of birth; but one can't have everything; he is a most able man, and really charming.
     It is such a good thing that he is so much older than Chèrie; I always felt she needed an older
     man to guide and care for her—he is positively devoted to her; you know, the devotion of a man
     of that age is such a different thing from a boy's affection."</p>
    <p>After that the visitor could not reasonably do anything but inquire if Mr. Smith was going to
     throw up the South African post which all the town knew he was about to take before his engagement.
     <pb n="221"/></p>
    <p>To this Mr. Polkington was obliged to answer, "No, he is going, and going almost directly;
     that is my one hardship; I have got to lose Chèrie at once, for he positively will not go
     without her. Of course, it would be a thousand pities for him to throw it up, such an opening;
     so very much better than he would ever have here, but it is hard to lose my child—she seems a
     child to me still—almost before I have realised that she is grown up. Their passages are taken
     already; they will be married by license almost directly; there even won't be time to get a
     trousseau, only the merest necessaries before the luggage has to go."</p>
    <p>It must not be thought that the news of Mr. Harding's engagement was the one and only thing
     which convinced Mrs. Polkington and Chèrie that the great campaign had failed; it was the
     finishing touch, no doubt, in that it had made Chèrie feel the necessity of being immediately
     engaged to some one, but there were other things at work. Captain Polkington had returned from
     London just five days before they heard the news, and three were quite sufficient to show his
     wife and daughter that he was considerably the worse for his stay in town. Bills too, had been
     coming in of late; not inoffensive, negligible bills such as they were very well used to, but
     threatening insistent bills, one even accompanied by a lawyer's letter. Then, to crown all,
     Captain Polkington had a fit of virtue and repentance on the second day after his return. It
     was not of long duration, and was, no doubt, partly physical, and not unconnected with the
     effects of his decline from the paths of temperance. But while it lasted, he read some of the
     bills and talked about the way ruin stared him in the face and the need there was for
     retrenchment, turning over a new leaf, facing facts and kindred things. Also, which was more
     important, he wrote to his wife's banker
     <pb n="222"/> brother—he who had been instrumental in getting the papers sent in years ago. To
     this influential person he said a good deal about the state of the family finances, the need
     there was for clearing matters up and starting on a better basis, and his own determination to
     face things fairly and set to work in earnest. What kind of work was not mentioned; apparently
     that had nothing to do with the Captain's resolution; there was one thing, however, that was
     mentioned definitely—the need for the banker brother's advice—and pecuniary assistance. The
     answer to this letter was received on the same day as the news of Mr. Harding's engagement. It
     came in the evening, later than the news, and it was addressed to Mrs. Polkington, not the
     Captain; it assisted her in recognising that the end of the campaign had arrived. It said
     several unpleasant things, and it said them plainly; not the most pleasant to the reader was
     the announcement that the writer would himself come to Marbridge to look into matters one day
     that week or the next. Under these circumstances it is not perhaps so surprising that Chèrie
     found it advisable to accept Mr. Brendon Smith's offer of marriage, and Mrs. Polkington found
     the impossibility of getting a trousseau in time no very great disadvantage.</p>
    <p>When Julia came home it wanted but a short time to Chèrie's wedding. A great deal seemed to
     have happened since she went away, not only to her family, but, and that was less obviously
     correct, to herself. She stood in the drawing-room on the morning after her return and looked
     round her and felt that somehow she had travelled a long way from her old point of view. The
     room was very untidy; it had not been used, and so, in accordance with the Polkington custom,
     not been set tidy for two days; dust lay thick on everything; there were dead leaves in the
     vases, cigarette ash on the table, no coals on the
     <pb n="223"/> half-laid fire. In the merciless morning light Julia saw all the deficiencies;
     the way things were set best side foremost, though, to her, the worst side contrived still to
     show; the display there was everywhere, the trumpery silver ornaments, all tarnished for want
     of rubbing, and of no more intrinsic value and beauty than the tinfoil off champagne bottles;
     the cracked pieces of china—rummage sale relics, she called them—set forth in a glass-doored
     cabinet, as if they were heirlooms. Mrs. Polkington had a romance about several of them that
     made them seem like heirlooms to her friends and almost to herself. The whole, as Julia looked
     around, struck her as shoddy and vulgar in its unreality.</p>
    <p>"I'm not coming back to it, no, I'm not," she said, half aloud; "the corduroy and onions
     would be a great deal better."</p>
    <p>Chèrie passed the open door at that minute and half heard her. "What did you say?" she
     asked.</p>
    <p>Julia looked round. "Nothing," she answered, "only that I am not coming back to this sort of
     life."</p>
    <p>"To Marbridge?" Chèrie asked, "or to the house? If it is the house you mean, you need not
     trouble about that; there isn't much chance of your being able to go on living here; you will
     have to move into something less expensive. I am sure Uncle William will insist on it. There is
     more room than you will want here after I am gone, and as for appearance and society, there
     won't be much object in keeping that up."</p>
    <p>Julia laughed. "You don't think I am a sufficiently marketable commodity to be worth much
     outlay?" she said. "You are quite right; besides, it is just that which I mean; I have come to
     the conclusion that I don't admire the way we live here."</p>
    <p>"So have I," Chèrie answered; "no one in their senses
     <pb n="224"/> would; but it was the best we could do in the circumstances and before you
     grumble at it you had better be sure you don't get something worse."</p>
    <p>Julia did not think she should do that, and Chèrie seeing it went on, "Oh, of course you have
     got £50 a year, I know, but you can't live on that; besides, I expect Uncle William will want
     you to do something else with it."</p>
    <p>"I shall do what I please," Julia replied, and Chèrie never doubted it; she would have done
     no less herself had she been the fortunate legatee, Uncle William or twenty Uncle Williams
     notwithstanding.</p>
    <p>This important relative had not been to Marbridge yet, in spite of what he wrote to his
     sister; he had not been able to get away. Indeed, he was not able to do so until the day after
     Chèrie's wedding. Mrs. Polkington was in a happy and contented frame of mind; the quiet wedding
     had gone off quite as well as Violet's grander one—really, a quiet wedding is more effective
     than a smart one in the dull time of year, and always, of course, less expensive. Chèrie had
     looked lovely in simple dress, and the presents, considering the quietness and haste, were
     surprisingly numerous and handsome. Mr. Smith was liked and respected by a wide circle. Mrs.
     Polkington felt satisfied and also very pleased to have Violet, her favourite daughter, with
     her again. She and Violet were talking over the events of the day with mutual congratulation,
     when Mr. William Ponsonby was announced.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, Violet's husband, Mr. Frazer, had gone to see his old friend the vicar, and more
     fortunately still, he was persuaded to stay and dine with him. It would have been rather
     awkward to have had him present at the display of family washing which took place that evening.
     Mr. Ponsonby did not mince matters; he said, perhaps
     <pb n="225"/> not altogether without justice, that he had had about enough of the Polkingtons.
     He also said he wanted the truth, and seeing that his sister had long ago found that about her
     own concerns so very unattractive that she never dealt with it naked; it did not show beautiful
     now. In the course of time, however, he got it, or near enough for working purposes. Out came
     all the bills, and out came the threatening letter and old account books and remembered debts
     both of times past and present; and when he had got them all, he added them up, showed Mrs.
     Polkington the total, and asked her what she was going to do.</p>
    <p>She said she did not know; privately she felt there was no need for her to consider the
     question; was it not the one her self-invited brother had come to answer? He did answer it,
     almost as soon as he asked it.</p>
    <p>"You will have to leave this house," he said, "sell what you can of its contents and pay all
     that is possible of your debts. You won't be able to pay many with that; the rest I shall have
     to arrange about, I suppose. Oh, not pay; don't think that for a moment; I've paid a deal more
     than I ought for you long ago. I mean to see the people and arrange that you pay by degrees;
     you will have to devote most of your income to that for a time. What will you live on in the
     meanwhile? This legacy—it is you who have got it, isn't it?" he said, turning to Julia; "I
     thought so. Fortunately the money is not in any way tied up, you can get at the principal.
     Well, the best thing to be done is to buy a good boarding-house. You could make a
     boarding-house pay, Caroline," he went on to his sister, "if you tried; your social gifts would
     be some use there—you will have to try."</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington looked a little dismayed, and Violet said, "It would be rather degrading,
     wouldn't it?"
     <pb n="226"/></p>
    <p>"Not so degrading as being sued at the county court," her uncle returned.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington felt there was truth in that, and, accustoming herself to a new idea with her
     usual rapidity, she even began to see that the alternative offered need not be so very
     unpleasant. Indeed, when she came to think about it, it might be almost pleasant if the
     boarding-house were very select; there would be society of a kind, perhaps of a superior kind,
     even; she need not lose prestige and she could still shine, and without such tremendous
     effort.</p>
    <p>But her reflections were interrupted by the Captain.</p>
    <p>"And what part have I in this scheme?" he asked.</p>
    <p>His brother-in-law, to whom the question was addressed, considered a moment. "Well, I really
     don't know," he said at last; "of course you would live in the house."</p>
    <p>"A burden on my wife and daughter! Idle, useless, not wanted!"</p>
    <p>The banker had no desire to hurt Captain Polkington's feelings, but he saw no reason why he
     should not hear the truth—that he had long been all these things; idle, useless, unwanted, a
     burden not only to his wife and daughters, but also to all relations and connections who
     allowed themselves to be burdened. But the Captain's feelings were hurt; he was surprised and
     injured, though convinced of little besides the hardness of fate and the fact that his
     brother-in-law misunderstood him. He turned to his wife for support, and she supported,
     corroborating both what he said and what her brother did too, though they were diametrically
     opposed. It looked rather as if the discussion were going to wander off into side issues, but
     Julia brought it back by inquiring of her uncle
     <pb n="227"/>—</p>
    <p>"What part have I in this scheme?"</p>
    <p>"You will help your mother," he answered, "and of course the concern will be nominally yours;
     that is to say, you will put your money in it, invest it in that instead of railways or
     whatever it is now in. I shall see that the thing is properly secured."</p>
    <p>He glanced at Captain Polkington as he spoke, as if he thought he might have designs upon the
     money or investment. Julia only said, "I see," but in so soft a voice that she roused Mr.
     Ponsonby's suspicions. He had dealt a good deal with men and women, and he did not altogether
     like the amused observing eyes of the legatee, and he distrusted her soft voice of seeming
     acquiescence.</p>
    <p>"It is of no use for you to get any nonsensical ideas," he said, "about what you will do and
     won't do; this is the only thing you can do; you have got to make a living, and you have got to
     pay your debts; beggars can't be choosers. The fact is, you have all lived on charity so long
     that you have got demoralised."</p>
    <p>Violet flushed. "Really," she began to say, "though you have helped us once or twice, I don't
     think you have the right to insult—" but Mrs. Polkington raised a quieting hand; she did not
     wish to offend her brother.</p>
    <p>He was not offended; he only spoke his mind rather plainly to them all, which, though it did
     no harm, did little good either; they were too old in their sins to profit by that now. After
     some more unpleasant talk all round, the family conclave broke up; Mr. Frazer came home, and
     every one went to bed.</p>
    <p>Mr. Ponsonby had Julia's tiny room; there was nowhere else for him, seeing Violet and her
     husband had the one she and her youngest sister shared in their maiden days. Julia had to
     content herself with the drawing-room sofa; it was a very uncomfortable sofa, and the blankets
     <pb n="228"/> kept slipping off so she did not sleep a great deal; but that did not matter
     much; she had the more time to think things over. Dawn found her sitting at the table wrapped
     in her blanket, writing by the light of one of the piano candles; she glanced up as the first
     cold light struggled in, and her face was very grave, it looked old, too, and tired, with the
     weariness which accompanies renunciation, quite as often as does peace or a sense of beatitude.
     She looked at the paper before her, a completely worked-out table of expenditure, a sort of
     statement of ways and means—the means being £50 a year. It could be done; she knew that during
     the night when the plan took shape in her mind; she had proved it to herself more than
     half-an-hour ago by figures—but there was no margin. It could only be done by renouncing that
     upon which she had set her heart; she could not work out the scheme and pay the debt of honour
     to Rawson-Clew. The legacy had at first seemed a heaven-sent gift for that purpose, but now,
     like the blue daffodil, it seemed that it could not be used to pay the debt. That was not to be
     paid by a heaven-sent gift any more than by a devil-helped theft; slow, honest work and patient
     saving might pay it in years, but nothing else it seemed. She put her elbows on the table and
     propped her chin on her locked hands looking down at the unanswerable figures, but they still
     told her the same hard truth.</p>
    <p>"I might save it in time; I could do without this—and this," she told herself. It is so easy
     to do without oneself when one's mind is set on some purpose, but one has no right to expect
     others to do without, too—the whole thing would be no good if the others had to; she knew that.
     No, the debt could not be paid this way; she had no right to do it; it was her own fancy, her
     hobby, perhaps. No one demanded that it should be paid; law did
     <pb n="229"/> not compel it; Rawson-Clew did not expect it; her father considered that it no
     longer existed; it was to please herself and herself alone that she would pay it, and her
     pleasure must wait.</p>
    <p>Possibly she did not reason quite all this; she only knew that she could not do what she had
     set her heart on doing with the first of Aunt Jane's money, and the renunciation cost her much,
     and gave her no satisfaction at all. But the matter once decided, she put it at the back of her
     mind, and by breakfast time she was her usual self; to tell the truth, she was looking forward
     to a skirmish with Uncle William, and that cheered her.</p>
    <p>After breakfast she led Mr. Ponsonby to the drawing-room, and he came not altogether
     unprepared for objections; he had half feared them last night.</p>
    <p>"Uncle William," she said. "I have been thinking over your plan, and I don't think I quite
     like it."</p>
    <p>"I dare say not," her uncle answered; "I can believe it; but that's neither here nor there,
     as I said last night, beggars can't be choosers."</p>
    <p>Julia did not, as Violet had, resent this; she was the one member of the family who was not a
     beggar, and she knew perfectly well she could be a chooser. She sat down. "Perhaps I had better
     say just what I mean," she said pleasantly; "I am not going to do it."</p>
    <p>"Not going to?" Mr. Ponsonby repeated indignantly. "Don't talk nonsense; you have got to,
     there's nothing else open to you; I'm not going to keep you all, feed, clothe and house you,
     and pay your debts into the bargain!"</p>
    <p>"No," said Julia; "no, naturally not; I did not think of that."</p>
    <p>"What did you think of, then?" her uncle demanded; he remembered that she had the nominal
     disposal of her
     <pb n="230"/> own money, and though her objections were ridiculous, even impertinent in the
     family circumstances, they might be awkward. "What do you object to? I suppose you don't like
     the idea of paying debts; none of you seem to."</p>
    <p>"No," Julia answered; "it isn't that; of course the debts must be paid in the way you say, it
     is the only way."</p>
    <p>"I am glad you think so," the banker said sarcastically; "though I may as well tell you,
     young lady, that it would still be done even without your approval. What is it you don't like,
     spending your money for other people?"</p>
    <p>Julia smiled a little. "We may as well call it that," she said; "I don't like the
     boarding-house investment."</p>
    <p>"What do you like? Seeing your parents go to the poorhouse? That's what will happen."</p>
    <p>"No, they can come and live with me. I have got a large cottage, a garden, a field, and £50 a
     year. If we keep pigs and poultry, and grow things in the garden we can live in the cottage on
     the £50 a year till the debts are all paid off; after that, of course, we should have enough to
     be pretty comfortable. We need not keep a servant there, or regard appearances or humbug—it
     would be very cheap."</p>
    <p>"And nasty," her uncle added. He was not impressed with the wisdom of this scheme; indeed he
     did not seriously contemplate it as possible. "You are talking nonsense," he said; "absurd,
     childish nonsense; you don't know anything about it; you have no idea what life in a cottage
     means; the drudgery of cooking and scrubbing and so on; the doing without society and the
     things you are used to; as for pigs and gardening, why, you don't know how to dig a hole or
     grow a cabbage!"</p>
    <p>But he was not quite right; Julia had learnt something about drudgery in Holland, something
     about growing things, at least in theory, and so much about doing with
     <pb n="231"/>out the society to which she was used at home that she had absolutely no desire
     for it left. She made as much of this plan to Mr. Ponsonby as was possible and desirable;
     enough, at all events, to convince him that she had thought out her plan in every detail and
     was very bent on it.</p>
    <p>"I suppose the utter selfishness of this idea of yours has not struck you," he said at last.
     "You may think you would like this kind of life, though you wouldn't if you tried it, but how
     about your mother?"</p>
    <p>"She won't like it," Julia admitted; "but then, on the other hand, there is father. I suppose
     you know he has taken to drink lately and at all times gambled as much as he could. What do you
     think would become of him in a boarding-house in some fashionable place, with nothing to do,
     and any amount of opportunity?"</p>
    <p>Mr. Ponsonby did not feel able or willing to discuss the Captain's delinquencies with his
     daughter; his only answer was, "What will become of your mother keeping pigs and poultry and
     living in an isolated cottage? It would be social extinction for her."</p>
    <p>"The boarding-house would be moral extinction for father."</p>
    <p>Mr. Ponsonby grew impatient. "I suppose you think," he said irritably, "that you have reduced
     it to this—the sacrifice of one parent or the other. You have no business to think about such
     things; but if you had, to which do you owe the most duty? Who has done the most for you?"</p>
    <p>"Well," Julia answered slowly, "I'm not sure I am considering duty only; people who don't pay
     their debts are not always great at duty, you know. Perhaps it is really inclination with me.
     Father is fonder of me than mother is; I have never been much of a social success. Mother
     <pb n="232"/> did not find me such good material to work upon, so naturally she rather dropped
     me for the ones who were good material. I admire mother the more, but I am sorrier for father,
     because he can't take care of himself, and has no consolation left; it serves him right, of
     course, but it must be very uncomfortable all the same. Do you see?"</p>
    <p>"No, I don't," her uncle answered shortly; "I am old-fashioned enough to think sons and
     daughters ought to do their duty to their parents, not analyse them in this way." He forgot
     that he had in a measure invited this analysis, and Julia did not remind him, although no doubt
     she was aware of it.</p>
    <p>"I should like to do my duty to them both," she said; "and I believe I will do it best by
     going to the cottage. Father would get to be a great nuisance to mother at the boarding-house
     after a time, almost as bad as the pigs and poultry at the cottage. Also, if we had the
     boarding-house, father's moral extinction would be complete, but if we lived at the cottage
     mother's social one would not; she could go and stay with Violet and other people the worst
     part of the time, while we were shortest of money. Besides all that, there are two other
     things; I like the cottage best myself, and I believe it to be the best—I know the sort of
     living life we should live at a boarding-house—and then there is Johnny Gillat."</p>
    <p>Mr. Ponsonby had no recollection of who Johnny Gillat was, and he did not trouble to ask;
     Julia's other reason was the one he seized upon. "You like it!" he said; "yes, now we have come
     to the truth; the person you are considering is yourself; I knew that all along; you need not
     have troubled to wrap it up in all these grand reasons—consideration for your father, and so on!"
     <pb n="233"/></p>
    <p>"Oh, but think how much better it sounded!" Julia said, with twinkling eyes.</p>
    <p>Mr. Ponsonby did not see the twinkle; he read Julia a lecture on selfishness and ended up by
     saying, "You are utterly selfish and ingrain lazy, that's what you are; you don't want to do a
     stroke of honest work for any one."</p>
    <p>"Dishonest work is where I shine," Julia told him. "Oh, not scoundrelly dishonesty, company
     promoting, and so on," (Mr. Ponsonby was on several boards of directors, but he was not a
     company promoter, still he snorted a little) "I mean real dishonest work; with a little
     practice I would make such a thief as you do not meet every day in the week."</p>
    <p>"I can quite believe it," her uncle retorted grimly; "lazy people generally do take to lying
     and stealing and, as I say, lazy is what you are. Sooner than work for your living, you go and
     pig in a cottage, because you think that way you can do nothing all day; lead an idle
     life."</p>
    <p>"Yes," Julia agreed sweetly; "I think that must be my reason—a nice comfortable idle life
     with the pigs and poultry, and garden, and cooking, and scrubbing, and two incompetent old men.
     I really think you must be right."</p>
    <p>Here it must be recorded, Mr. Ponsonby very nearly lost his temper, and not without
     justification. Was he not giving time and consideration and (probably) money to help this
     hopeless family on to its legs again? And was it not more than mortal middle-aged man could
     bear, not only to be opposed by the only member with any means, but also to be made sly fun of
     by her? He gave Julia his opinion very sharply, and no doubt she deserved it. But the worst of
     it was that did not prevent her from exercising the right of the person who is not a beggar to
     choose.</p>
    <p>The Polkington family, who were soon afterwards
     <pb n="234"/> called in to assist at the discussion, sided with Mr. Ponsonby. Violet and Mrs.
     Polkington with great decision, the Captain more weakly. Eventually he was won over to Julia
     because her scheme seemed to hold a place for him where he could flatter himself he was wanted.
     The argument went on and angrily, on the part of some present; Julia was most amiable; but, as
     the Van Heigens had found, she was an extremely awkward antagonist, the more amiable, the more
     awkward, even in a weak position, as with them, and in a strong one, as now, she was a great
     deal worse. Mr. Ponsonby lost the train he meant to catch back to London; he did not do it only
     for the benefit of his sister, but also because Julia had given battle and he was not going to
     retire from the field. Violet and Mr. Frazer deliberately postponed the hour of their
     departure; Violet was determined not to leave things in this condition; Julia's plan, she
     considered a disgrace to the whole family. Mr. Frazer was asked not to come to the family
     council; Violet explained to him that they were having trouble with Julia; she would tell him
     all about it afterwards, but it distressed her mother so much that it would perhaps be kinder
     if he was not there at the time. Mr. Frazer quite agreed; he shared some of his wife's
     sentiments about appearances; also he had no wish to be distressed either in mind or
     tastes.</p>
    <p>Violet did tell him about it afterwards; a curtailed and selected version, but one eminently
     suitable to the purpose. On hearing it he was justly angry with Julia's heartless selfishness
     in keeping her legacy to herself. He was also shocked at her determination to go and live a
     farm labourer's life in a farm labourer's cottage. He was truly sorry for Mrs. Polkington,
     between whom and himself there existed a mutual affection and admiration. He said it was
     bitterly hard that her one remaining daughter should
     <pb n="235"/> treat her thus; that it was barbarous, impossible, that a woman of her age,
     tastes, refinement and gifts should be compelled to lead such a life as was proposed. In fact
     he could not and would not permit it; he hoped that she would make her home at his rectory;
     nay, he insisted upon it; both Violet and himself would not take a refusal; she must and should
     come to them.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic"/>
    <p>Julia smiled her approval; when things were worked up to this end; she would have liked to
     clap her applause, it was so well done. Mrs. Polkington and Violet were so admirable, they were
     already almost convinced of all they said; in two days they would believe it quite as much as
     Mr. Ponsonby did now. She did not in the least mind having to appear as the ungrateful
     daughter; it fitted in so beautifully with Violet's arrangement. And really the arrangement was
     very good; the utilitarian feelings of the family did not suffer at wrenches and splits as did
     more tender ones; no one would object much to an advantageous division. And most advantageous
     it certainly was; the cottage household would go better without Mrs. Polkington and she would
     be far happier at the rectory. She would not make any trouble there; rather, she would give her
     son-in-law cause to be glad of her coming; there would be scope for her there, and she would
     possibly develop better than she had ever had a chance of doing before.</p>
    <p>So everything was decided. The house in East Street was to be given up, and most of its
     contents sold; as Julia's cottage was furnished already with Aunt Jane's things, she need only
     take a few extras from the home. The debts were to be paid as far as possible now, and the
     small income was to be divided; part was to go as pin money to Mrs. Polkington, the main part
     of the re
     <pb n="236"/>mainder to go to the debts, and a very small modicum to come with the Captain to
     the cottage.</p>
    <p>Julia was quite satisfied, and let it be apparent. This, with her obvious cheerfulness,
     rather incensed Violet, who regarded the sale of their effects as rather a disgrace, and
     Julia's plans for the future, as a great one.</p>
    <p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," she told her younger sister, just before she left
     Marbridge. "I am positively ashamed to think you belong to us. It will be nice to meet Norfolk
     people at the Palace or somewhere, who have seen you tending your pigs and doing your washing.
     It is such an unusual name; I can quite fancy some one being introduced to mother and thinking
     it odd that her name should be the same as some dirty cottage people."</p>
    <p>"Well," Julia suggested, "why not change it? Such a trifle as a name surely need not stand in
     our way; we have got over worse things than that. Mother can be something else, or I can;
     mother had better do it; father will forget who he is if I make a change."</p>
    <p>"Don't be absurd," Violet said; "I only wish you could change it though; I never want to
     write to you as Julia Polkington in case some servant were to notice the address; one never
     knows how these things come out."</p>
    <p>"Don't write as that," her sister told her; "address me as 'Julia Snooks' or anything else
     you like; I am not particular."</p>
    <p>Violet did not take this as a serious suggestion; nevertheless, Julia told Mr. Frazer on the
     platform at Marbridge that she and Violet had been having a christening, and that she was now
     Julia Snooks. Mr. Ponsonby said it was ridiculous, to which Julia replied—</p>
    <p>"That is what I am myself."</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington said it was foolish too, but she did not
     <pb n="237"/> say so vehemently; she felt that in the Frazer circle, especially at the Palace
     where she would meet people from everywhere, she might possibly come across some one who had
     heard of Julia. It was unlikely; still it is a small world, and Polkington an uncommon name.
     "Why not choose something simple, like 'Gray'?" she suggested.</p>
    <p>"Because," Julia answered, "that is what I am not."</p>
    <p>But fate had one exceedingly bitter pill for Mrs. Polkington. On the day after Chèrie and her
     husband sailed for South Africa, it was known in Marbridge that the news of Mr. Harding's
     engagement was false. The girl gossip had coupled with him was engaged, it is true, and to a
     Mr. Harding, but to another and entirely different bearer of the name. The real, eligible Mr.
     Harding called at East Street to explain to Mrs. Polkington how the mistake had arisen, to tell
     her that he himself had been away in the north for some weeks and so had heard nothing of it.
     Also to hear—and he had heard nothing of that either—that Chèrie was married and gone.</p>
    <p>The news of Mr. Harding's freedom and his call, and what she fancied it might have implied,
     did not reach Chèrie till after her arrival in Africa. It did not tend to soothe the first
     weeks of married life, nor to make easier the rigorous, but no doubt wholesome, breaking-in
     process to which her husband wisely subjected her.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
    <head>THE GOOD COMRADE</head>
    <p>Rawson-Clew was very busy that autumn, so busy that the events which had taken place in
     Holland were rather blotted out of his mind; he had not exactly forgotten them, only among the
     press of other things he did not often think about them and they soon came to take their proper
     unimportant place among his recollections. Julia he thought of occasionally, but less and less
     in connection with the foolish holiday, more in connection with some chance saying or doing.
     Things recalled her, a passage in a book, a sentiment she would have shared, an opinion she
     would have combated. Or perhaps it was that some one he met set him thinking of her shrewd
     swift judgments; some scene in which he played a part that made him imagine her an amused
     spectator of its unconscious absurdity. He had turned her thyme flowers out of his pocket; he
     had no sentiment about them or her, but he did not forget her; their acquaintance had, to a
     certain extent, been a thing of mind, and in mind it seemed he occasionally came in contact
     with her still. Also there is no doubt she must have been one of those virile people who take
     hold, for though one could sometimes overlook her presence, in absence one did not forget.</p>
    <p>Of herself and her doings he never heard; at first he had half thought he might have some communication
     <pb n="239"/> from Mr. Gillat, but as the autumn went on and he heard nothing, he came to the
     conclusion that she really must have arranged something satisfactorily and there was an end to
     the whole affair. He settled down to his own concerns and became very thoroughly absorbed in
     them, to the exclusion of nearly everything else. For women he never had much taste, and now,
     being busy and preoccupied, he got into the way of scanning them more critically than ever when
     he did happen to come across them. Not comparing them with any ideal standard, but just finding
     them uninteresting, whether they were the cultivated, well-bred girls of the country, or the
     smart young matrons and wide-awake maidens of the town.</p>
    <p>That autumn the young Rawson-Clew, Captain Polkington's acquaintance, came into a fortune and
     took a wife. The latter was, perhaps, on the whole, a wise proceeding, for, though the wife in
     question would undoubtedly help him in the rapid and inevitable spending of the fortune, she
     was likely also to enable him to get more for his money than if he were spending alone.
     Rawson-Clew was not introduced to this lady till the winter, then, one evening, he met her at a
     friend's "at home."</p>
    <p>She was very pretty, small and fair and plump, with childish blue eyes, and an anything but
     childish mind behind them. She had dainty little feet, as well shaped as any he had ever seen,
     and she was perfectly dressed, her gown a diaphanous creation of melting colours and floating
     softness, which suggested more than it revealed of her person, like a nymph's drapery. She was
     the centre of attraction and talked and laughed a great deal, the latter in little tinkles like
     a child of five, the former from the top of her throat with the faintest lisp and in the
     strange jargon that was the slang of the moment. She knew no more of Florentine art or Wagner
     or Egyptology
     <pb n="240"/> than Julia did, and cared even less. She set out to be intelligently ignorant—to
     be anything else was called "middle-class" in her set—and she achieved her end, although she
     could do some things extremely well—play bridge, gamble in stocks and shares and anything else,
     and arrange lights and colours with the skill of an artist when a suitable setting for her
     pretty self was concerned. She had all the charms of womanly weakness without any old-fashioned
     and grandmotherly narrowness; she was quite free and emancipated in mind and manners, no man
     had to modify his language for her; she preferred a double meaning to a single one, and a
      <hi>risque</hi> story to a plain one. She had an excellent taste in dinners, a critical one in
     liqueurs, and a catholic one in men.</p>
    <p>She was most gracious to Rawson-Clew when he was introduced, breaking up her court and
     dismissing her admirers solely to accommodate him. The instant she saw him, before she heard
     who he was, she picked him out as the game best worthy of her prowess, and she lost no time in
     addressing herself to the chase with the skill and determination of a Diana—though that perhaps
     is hardly a good comparison, enthusiasm for the chase being about the only quality she shared
     with the maiden huntress.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew did not show signs of succumbing at once to her charms; she hardly expected that
     he would, for she gave him credit for knowing his own value and was not displeased thereby;
     where is the pleasure of sport if the quarry be captured at the outset? But if he did not
     succumb he did all that was otherwise expected of him, standing in attendance on her and
     sitting by her when he was invited to the settee she had chosen in a quiet corner. So well,
     indeed, did he comport himself that by the time they parted she felt fairly satisfied with her progress.
     <pb n="241"/></p>
    <p>Perhaps she would have been less satisfied if she had heard something he said soon after. A
     man he knew left the house at the same time he did and persuaded him to come to the club. On
     the way the little lady came in for some discussion; the other man chiefly gave his opinion
     though he once asked Rawson-Clew what he thought of his young cousin's wife.</p>
    <p>"As a wife?" he answered; "I should not think of her. If I wanted, as I certainly do not, the
     privilege of paying that kind of woman's bills, I should not bother to marry her."</p>
    <p>The other man laughed, but if he quarrelled with anything in the answer, it appeared to be
     the taste rather than the judgment. He maintained that the lady was charming; Rawson-Clew
     merely said—</p>
    <p>"Think so?" and did not even trouble to defend his opinion.</p>
    <p>At the club he found a box that had come for him by parcels post. A wooden one with the
     address printed on a card and nailed to the lid, which was screwed down. It did not look
     particularly interesting; he told one of the club servants to unscrew it for him. When he came
     to examine the contents he found, first a lot of damp packing, and then a wide-necked stoppered
     bottle, two-thirds full of white powder. It bore a label printed neatly like the address—</p>
    <p>"Herr Van de Greutz's Explosive.</p>
    <p>"Formula as he said it...."</p>
    <p>For a moment Rawson-Clew held the bottle, staring at it in blank astonishment; so tense was
     his attitude that it caught the other man's attention.</p>
    <p>"Hullo!" he said, "some one sent you an infernal machine?"
     <pb n="242"/></p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew roused himself. "No," he answered shortly.</p>
    <p>He put the bottle back in the box after he had felt in the packing and found nothing, then he
     fastened it up with more care than was perhaps necessary. He looked at the address on the lid,
     but it told him nothing more than it had at first; neither that nor the name of the post-office
     from which it was sent gave any clue to the sender. And yet he felt as if Julia were at his
     elbow with that mute sympathy in her eyes which had been there when they talked of failure in
     the wood on the Dunes.</p>
    <p>He rose, and taking the box, went towards the door; the other man watched him curiously. "One
     would think you had found a ghost in your box," he said.</p>
    <p>"I'm not sure that I have not," Rawson-Clew looked back to answer; "the ghost of a good
     comrade."</p>
    <p>Then he went home.</p>
    <p>When he was alone in his chambers and secure from interruption, he opened the box again and
     took out all the packing, carefully sorting it. But he found nothing, no scrap of paper, no
     clue of any sort; he took off the linen rag that fastened in the bottle stopper, but that
     betrayed nothing either; and yet he thought of Julia.</p>
    <p>She was the only person who could know about the explosive. It had never been actually spoken
     of last summer, but the chances were she knew. She was the only person who could have known or
     who could have got it. It was like her, so like that he was as sure as if her name were in the
     box that she was the sender. How she had got the stuff he could not think, he knew the
     difficulties in the way; but she had done it somehow, and now she had sent it to him, without
     name for fear of embarrassing him, without clue, with no desire for thanks—loyal, generous,
     <pb n="243"/>able little comrade! He looked up again; he felt as if she were bodily present;
     the whole thing, astounding as he had found it at first, was somehow so characteristic of her.
     And because of her presence he suddenly wished he had not been to that evening's entertainment
     and sat close by his cousin's wife and heard the things she said, and answered the things she
     looked. He felt as if he were not clean, as if he had no right to entertain even the ghost of
     the good comrade.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew was not self-conscious; it never occurred to him to think if he appeared
     ridiculous, whether he was alone or in company. He took off his dress coat and flung it aside
     with a feeling of disgust; its sleeve had brushed that woman's bare arm; he could almost fancy
     that a suggestion of the scent she used clung to it. He put it out of sight and fetched some
     other garment before he came back to the thing which had recalled Julia. And yet the girl was
     no lily-child with the dew of dawn upon her; he did not for one instant think she was;
     probably, had she been, she would not have been the good comrade. The facts of life were not
     strange to her, she knew them, good and bad; was not above laughing at what was funny even if
     it was somewhat coarse, but she had no taste for lascivious wallowing no matter under what name
     disguised. A man could be at home with her, he could speak the truth to her; but he would not
     make a point of taking her into the society of that woman, any more than he would invite a
     friend to look at the sink, unless there was some purpose to serve.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew took up the bottle and looked at it, and looked at the address card on the lid,
     all over again; and there grew in his mind the conviction that he been a remarkable and
     particular fool. Not because he had taken that holiday on the Dunes, nor yet because he had
     failed to get the explosive and Julia had succeeded—he be
     <pb n="244"/>lieved that a man might have average intelligence and yet fail there, for he
     thought she had more than average. But because he had failed to recognise a fact that had been
     existent all the time—the need he had for the good comrade. Why had he a better liking for his
     work than of old? Because it was such as she would have liked, could have done well, every now
     and then he fancied her there. Why did he find new pleasure in the hours he spent reading
     Renaissance Italian, old memoirs, the ripe wisdom of the late Tudors and early Stuarts? Because
     he found her in the pages, saw her laugh sometimes, heard her contradict at others; felt her,
     invisible and not always recognised, at his elbow.</p>
    <p>He looked round; why should not the presence be fact instead of fancy? He would go to Mr.
     Gillat and find her whereabouts; if Julia was in England, as she probably was, seeing that the
     box was posted in London, the old man would know where she was. He would go to Berwick
     Street—he looked at the clock—no, not now; it was too late, or rather too early; he would have
     to wait till the morning was a good deal older.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the carrying out of the plan did not prove very successful. Berwick Street he
     found, and No. 31 he found, but not Mr. Gillat; he was gone and had left no address. Mrs. Horn
     did not seem troubled by the omission; he had paid everything before he went away, and he
     practically never had any letters to be sent on; why, she asked, should she bother after his
     address?</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew could not tell her why she should, nor did he give any reason why he himself
     should. He went away and, reversing the order of his previous search, went to Marbridge.</p>
    <p>But failure awaited him there, too. When he came to the Polkingtons' house he found it empty,
     the blinds
     <pb n="245"/> down, the steps uncleaned, and bills announcing that it was to let in the
     windows. He stood and looked at it in the grey afternoon, and for a moment he was conscious of
     a feeling of desolation and disappointment which was almost absurd. He turned away and began to
     make inquiries about the family. He soon learnt all that was commonly known. They had been gone
     from East Street some little time now; they must have left before the box containing the
     explosive was posted. Julia had sent it to Aunt Jane's lawyer, before she set out for the
     cottage, asking him to dispatch it at a given date, and he had fulfilled her request, thinking
     it a wedding present and the date specified one near the impending ceremony. This, of course,
     Rawson-Clew did not find out; he found out several things about the Polkingtons though, their
     debts and difficulties, their sale and the break up of the family. He also found out that the
     youngest Miss Polkington was married and the second, and now only remaining one, had come home
     before the break up. As to where the family were now, that was not quite so clear; Mrs.
     Polkington was with one of her married daughters; her address was easily obtainable and
     apparently considered all that any one could require, and quite sufficient to cover the rest of
     the family. Captain Polkington—nobody thought much about him—when they did, it was generally
     concluded he was with his wife. As for Julia, she must have got a situation of some
     sort—unless, which was unlikely, she was with her parents. Rawson-Clew took Mrs. Polkington's
     address—it was all he could get—and determined to write to her.</p>
    <p>It did occur to him to write to Julia at her sister's house and request that his letter was
     forwarded; but he did not do so; he was not at all sure she would answer; he wanted
     <pb n="246"/>to see her face to face this time. He wrote to Mrs. Polkington and asked her for
     Julia's address, introducing himself as a friend met in Holland, and explaining his reason,
     vaguely to be connected with that time.</p>
    <p>When Mrs. Polkington received the letter she thought it over a little; then she showed it to
     Violet, and they discussed it together. At the outset they made a mistake; they only knew of
     one person of the name of Rawson-Clew—the Captain's young acquaintance; he had certainly gone
     away from Marbridge last spring and so in point of time could have met Julia in Holland, only
     it was not likely that he had, or that he had become friendly with her. At least so Violet
     said; Mrs. Polkington, who knew what remarkable things herself and family could do in the way
     of getting to know people, was inclined to think differently. On one point, however, they were
     agreed; it would be very unpleasant to have to tell one in the position of Mr. Rawson-Clew
     about Julia's present proceedings. Giving the address would be giving the information, or
     something like it—one would have to explain—"Miss Julia Snooks, White's Cottage, near
     Halgrave."</p>
    <p>"We can't do that," Violet said with decision.</p>
    <p>"I might say I would forward a letter, perhaps?" Mrs. Polkington suggested.</p>
    <p>But Violet did not think that would do either. "Julia would answer it," she said; "and that
     would be quite as bad; you know, she is not in the least ashamed of herself."</p>
    <p>Mrs. Polkington did know it. "I believe you are right," she said, with the air of one
     convinced against her will; "Julia has voluntarily cut herself adrift from her own class; it
     would be unpleasant and embarrassing for her as well as for other people to force her into any
     connection with it again; I don't think any purpose can be served by reopening an acquaintance
     with Mr. Raw
     <pb n="247"/>son-Clew, we did not know him at Marbridge"—she never forgot that his circle there
     did not think her good enough to know. "I cannot imagine that it would be advantageous for
     Julia to write to him or hear from him under the present circumstances. He comes of a Norfolk
     family, too (Mrs. Polkington always knew about people's families even when she did not know
     them personally; it was the sort of information that interested her); I don't know what part of
     the county his people belong to, very likely nowhere near Julia; but supposing it were near
     enough for him to know from the address what kind of a place Julia was in, it really might be
     so awkward; we ought to be very careful for dear Richard's sake, especially seeing his
     connection with the Palace. I really think it would be wiser as you say, to be on the safe
     side."</p>
    <p>So she kept on that side, which, being, interpreted meant leaving Rawson-Clew's information
     much where it was before. She wrote very nicely, somewhat involved, not at all baldly; but
     reduced to plain terms her letter came to this—she was not going to tell Julia's address or
     anything about her.</p>
    <p>So Rawson-Clew read it, and very angry he was. And the worst of all was that on the same
     night that he received this letter, he also received orders to go at once to Constantinople. He
     had no time for anything and no choice but to go and leave the search. But during his journey
     across Europe an idea came to him with the suddenness of an inspiration. He knew what Julia had
     done—she had "retired," even as she had said she hoped to on the first day they walked
     together. She had retired somewhere from shams and hypocrisy, from society and her family;
     possibly even she had adopted the corduroy and onions part of the ambition; if so, that would ex
     <pb n="248"/>plain her mother's refusal, based on some kind of pride, to give her address. She
     had retired, and she had taken Johnny Gillat with her, and her own people had washed their
     hands of her! He knew now what to look for when he should come back. He might not be back for
     two months or even three, but when he did come he would be able to find Julia and talk to her
     about the explosive—and other things.</p>
    <p>It may be here said that the wonderful explosive did not do what was expected of it, either
     in England or Holland, for it was found to decompose on keeping. It did everything else that
     was boasted of it, but no one succeeded in keeping it more than fifteen months, an irremediate
     defect in an explosive for military purposes. This, of course, was not discovered at first, and
     the honour and glory of obtaining the specimen was considerable, if only there had been some
     one to take it. Rawson-Clew did not consider himself the person.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER XVI</head>
    <head>THE SIMPLE LIFE</head>
    <p>Julia was collecting fir-cones. All around her the land lay brown and still; dead heather,
     and sometimes dead bracken, a shade paler, and, more rarely, gorse bushes, nearly brown, too,
     in their sober winter dress. It was almost flat, a wonderful illimitable place, very remote,
     very silent, unbroken except for occasional pine-trees. These were not scattered but grew in
     clumps, miles apart, though looking near in this place of distances, and also in a belt not
     more than five or six trees wide, winding mile after mile like a black band over the plain.
     Julia stood on the edge of this belt now, gathering the dropped cones and putting them into a
     sack. The afternoon was advanced and already it was beginning to grow dark among the trees, but
     she determined not to go till she had got all she could carry. It was the first time she had
     been to collect cones; she had sent her father once and Mr. Gillat once. They had taken longer
     and gathered less than she, but it was not on that account that she had gone herself to-day.
     Rather it was because she wanted to go to the dark belt of trees which she saw every day from
     her window, and because she wanted to go right out into the wide open land and see what it
     looked like and feel what it felt like. And when she got there she found it, like the Dunes,
     all she had expected and more.</p>
    <p>At last she had her sack full, and, shouldering it, carried it off on her back, which, seeing
     the comfort of the
     <pb n="250"/> arrangement, must be the way Nature intended weights to be carried. Clear of the
     shadow of the trees it was lighter; the grey sky held the light long; twilight seemed to creep
     up from the ground rather than fall from above, as if darkness were an earth-born thing that
     gained slowly, and, for a time, only upon the brighter gift of Heaven. It was quieter, too, out
     here, for under the pines, though the weather was still, there was a breathing moan as if the
     trees sighed incessantly in their sleep. But out here in the brown land it was very quiet; the
     air light and dry and keen, with the flavour of the not distant sea mingled with the smell of
     the pines and the dead ferns—a thing to stir the pulse and revive the memory of the divine
     inheritance and the old belief that man is but a little lower than the angels, related to the
     infinite and god-like.</p>
    <p>White's Cottage stood where the heath-land ceased and the sand began. There was much sand;
     tradition said it had gradually overwhelmed a village that lay beyond; indeed, that White's
     Cottage was the last and most distant house of the lost place. Be that as it may, it certainly
     was very solitary, rather far from the village of Halgrave, with no road leading to it except
     the track that came from Halgrave and stopped at the cottage gate—there was nowhere to go
     beyond.</p>
    <p>Dusk had almost deepened to darkness when Julia reached the house; it gleamed curiously in
     the half light, for it was built of flints, for the most part grey, but with a paler one here
     and there catching the light. She put her sack of cones in one of the several sheds which were
     built on the sides of the cottage, and which, being of the same flint material, made it look
     larger than it was. Then she went into the kitchen.</p>
    <p>Johnny Gillat was there before her; he had been busy in the garden all the afternoon, but,
     with the help of the
     <pb n="251"/> field-glasses which he had not been allowed to sell, he had descried her coming
     across the open land. As soon as he was sure of her, and while she was still a good way off, he
     hurried away his tools into the house to get ready. He wanted it all to look to her as it had
     to him on the day when he came back from cone-getting—the fire blazing, the tea ready, the
     kitchen snug and neat; very unlike the dining-room at Marbridge with the one gas jet burning
     and "Bouquet" alight. Of course Johnny did not quite succeed; he never did in matters small or
     great, but he did his best. The dinner things, which Captain Polkington was to have washed,
     were not done, and still about. They had to be put in the back kitchen, and Johnny, who had no
     idea of saving labour, took so long carrying them away, that he hardly had time to set the tea.
     He had meant to make some toast, but there was no time for that; the first piece of bread had
     no more than begun to get warm when he heard Julia's step outside. But the fire was blazing
     nicely, and that was the chief thing; even though the putting on of the kettle had been
     forgotten. When Julia came in and saw the fire and crooked tablecloth and hastily-arranged
     cups, and Johnny's beaming face, she exclaimed, "How cubby it looks! Why, you have got the tea
     all ready, and"—sniffing the air—"I believe you are making toast; that is nice!"</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat beamed; then he caught sight of the kettle standing on the hearth, and his face
     fell.</p>
    <p>But Julia put it on the fire. "It will give you good time to finish the toast while it
     boils," she said; "toast ought not to be hurried, you know; yours will be just right."</p>
    <p>It was not; it was rather smoky when it came to be eaten, the fire not being very suitable;
     but that did not matter; Julia declared it perfect. This was the only
     <pb n="252"/> form of hypocrisy she practised in the simple life; possibly, if she thought of
     the will more than the deed, it was really not such great hypocrisy. At all events she
     practised it; she did not think truth so beautiful that frail daily life must be the better for
     its undiluted and uncompromising application to all poor little tender efforts.</p>
    <p>During tea the great subject of conversation was the hen house. The last occupant of the
     cottage had kept hens and all the out-buildings were in good repair; however, a recent gale had
     loosened part of the roof of this one, and Captain Polkington had been mending it. There had
     not been much to do; the Captain could not do a great deal; his faculties of work—if he ever
     had any—had atrophied for want of use. Still, he thought he had done a good day's work, and, as
     a consequence, was important and inclined to be exacting. That is the reason why he had
     neglected the dinner things; he felt that a man who had done all he had was entitled to some
     rest and consideration. Julia did not mind in the least; if he was happy and contented, that
     was all she wished; she never reckoned his help as one of the assets of the household. For that
     matter, she had not reckoned Mr. Gillat's of much value either, but there she found she was a
     little mistaken. Johnny was very slow and very laborious and really ingenious in finding a
     wrong way of doing things even when she thought she had left him no choice, but he was very
     painstaking and persevering. He would do anything he was told, and he took the greatest
     pleasure in doing it. Whether it was digging in the garden, or feeding the pigs, or collecting
     firewood, or setting the table for meals, he was certain to do everything to the best of his
     ability, and was perfectly happy if she would employ him. There can be no doubt that the coming
     to White's Cottage began a time of real hap
     <pb n="253"/>piness to Mr. Gillat; possibly the happiest since his wealthy boyhood when he
     spent lavishly and indiscriminately on anybody and everybody. The Captain was less happy; his
     satisfaction was of an intermittent order. His discontent did not take the form of wishing to
     go back to Marbridge or to join his wife, only in feeling oppressed and misunderstood, and
     wishing occasionally that he had not been born or had been born rich—and of course remained so
     all his life. He was dissatisfied that evening when the contentment begotten of his work had
     worn off; he wanted to go to the market town to-morrow. Julia was going to get several
     necessaries for the household; he considered that he ought to go too, but she would not take
     him.</p>
    <p>"You will have a great deal to carry," he protested.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Julia agreed; "but I shall manage it."</p>
    <p>"It is not fit for you to go about alone," her father urged.</p>
    <p>She forebore to smile, though the novelty, not to say tardiness of the idea amused her; she
     only said, "It would take you and Johnny too long to walk into the town; we can't afford to
     spend too long on the way, and we can't afford a cart to take us."</p>
    <p>The Captain was not convinced; he never was by any one's logic but his own; perhaps because
     his own was totally different to all other kinds, including the painful logic of facts. He
     sighed deeply. "It is a strange, a humiliating condition of things," he observed to Mr. Gillat,
     "when a father has to ask his daughter's permission to go into town."</p>
    <p>Johnny rubbed the side of his chair thoughtfully, then a bright idea occurred to him. "Ah,
     but," he said, "gentlemen always have to ask ladies' permission before they
     <pb n="254"/> can accompany them anywhere—especially when it is the lady of the house."</p>
    <p>A wise man might not perhaps have said this last, but Johnny did, and as it happened, it did
     not much matter; before the Captain could answer, Julia rose from the table and began to clear
     away.</p>
    <p>Sundry household jobs had to be done in the evening; some were always left till then; in
     these short dark days it was advisable to use the light for work out of doors. At last,
     however, all was done, and Julia began to arrange for to-morrow. The Captain was sulky and sure
     that he would have rheumatism and so not be able to go out. His daughter did not seem to be
     greatly troubled; she told him of some easy work in the house he could do, or if he liked and
     felt able, he would perhaps go and get more fir-cones; there were plenty, and they saved other
     fuel. The Captain replied that he was not in the habit of taking orders from his children.</p>
    <p>Johnny looked unhappy; he did not like these ruffles to the tranquil life; it always pained
     him for any one to be dissatisfied, with reason or without it. When Julia turned to him he was
     even more ready than usual to take orders; he would have done anything she told him from
     sweeping the copper flue to calling upon the rector, but secretly he hoped she would give him
     work in the garden.</p>
    <p>The garden was of considerable size, and, by some freak of nature, of fairly good soil,
     though the field and most of the surrounding land was very poor. They had all worked hard in
     this plot ever since their coming; there was not much more to be done, or at least not much
     planting, which was what Mr. Gillat liked. However, there had been no sharp frosts yet and
     Julia, who knew his tastes, thought she could find something to please him.
     <pb n="255"/> She called him to the back kitchen and between them they brought from there a
     wooden case, the contents of which she began to sort over to find an occupation suitable to
     him. The box was getting rather empty now, but there was still something in it, bulbs and seeds
     and printed directions, and a strange mixed smell of greyish-brown paper and buckwheat husks
     and the indescribable smell of Dutch barns.</p>
    <p>It had come from Holland, from the Van Heigens; it was Mijnheer's present to the disgraced
     companion who had been so summarily dismissed. When Julia went to the cottage, it occurred to
     her to write to Mijnheer and tell him where she was, and how she meant to live a harmless
     horticultural life. She had come to think that perhaps she ought to tell him; she knew how her
     own words, about the way they were thrusting a sinner down, would stay with him and his wife.
     They would quite likely grow in the slow mind of the old man until he became uneasy and unhappy
     about her, and blamed himself for her undoing. At the time that she spoke she wasted the words
     to so grow and germinate; but now, looking back, she could think differently; after all the Van
     Heigens had only done what they thought right, and she had done what she knew to be at least
     open to doubt. And they had not thrust her down; it would take considerably more than that to
     do anything of the sort; they had allowed her an opportunity which she had used to achieve a
     great success. And now that it was achieved and she had left it all behind and was settled to
     the simple life—her vague ambition—her heart went out to the simple folk who had first shown
     her that it might be good; who had been kind to her when there was nothing to gain, who had
     made her ashamed.</p>
    <p>So she wrote to Mijnheer and told him that she had
     <pb n="256"/> fared well, and found another situation in Holland after leaving his service.
     Also that she had now left it and, having inherited a little property, had come to live in a
     country cottage with her father. She further said that she meant to imitate the Dutch and do
     her own house-work and also grow things, vegetables especially, in her garden.</p>
    <p>And Mijnheer, when he got the letter, was delighted; so, too, was Mevrouw; Joost said
     nothing. They read the letter two or three times, showed it to the Snieders (including Denah)
     and to the Dutch girl who now filled Julia's situation—more or less. They talked over it a
     great deal and over Julia too; they remembered every detail about her, her good points and her
     great fall. They were as delighted as they could be to hear that she was well and happy and
     apparently, good. Mijnheer especially was pleased to hear that she was with her father—he did
     not know that gentleman—he was sure she would be well looked after with him, and that, so he
     said, was what she wanted. So, contrary to their theory, but not out of accord with their
     practice, they forgave the sin for the sake of the sinner, and Mijnheer ordered to be packed,
     seeds and bulbs and plants for Julia's garden. He selected them himself, flowers as well as
     vegetables, sorts which he thought most suitable; and he ordered Joost to stick to the bags
     strips cut out of catalogues where, in stiff Dutch-English, directions are given as to how to
     grow everything that can be grown. And if Joost put in some sorts not included in his father's
     list, and failed to tell the good man about it, it was no doubt all owing to his having at one
     time associated with the dishonest Julia.</p>
    <p>The packing and dispatching of the box gave great pleasure to the Van Heigens; but the
     receiving and un
     <pb n="257"/>packing gave even greater pleasure when at last it reached Miss Snooks at White's
     Cottage. Julia had not told Mijnheer why she was Miss Snooks now and he, after grave
     consideration, decided that it must be because of the legacy, and in fulfilment of some obscure
     English law of property. Having so decided, he addressed the case in good faith, and advised
     her of its departure.</p>
    <p>Julia and Mr. Gillat planted the things that came in the box; Julia planted most, but Mr.
     Gillat enjoyed it even when he was only looking on. There was one bulb she set when he was not
     there to look on, but it did not come with the others. She chose a spot that best fulfilled the
     conditions described in the directions for growing daffodils and there, late one afternoon, she
     planted the bulb that she had brought with her from the Van Heigens. Afterwards she marked the
     place round and told Johnny and her father there was a choice flower there which was not to be
     touched.</p>
    <p>Julia went to the market town as she had arranged. Mr. Gillat worked in the garden; Captain
     Polkington watched him for a little and then went out, after spending, as he always did, some
     time getting ready. He took a basket with him; he thought of collecting fir-cones and he
     objected to the sack, though it held a vast deal more; he felt carrying it to be derogatory to
     a soldier and a gentleman. It is true he did not get fir-cones that day, but he really meant to
     when he started.</p>
    <p>Julia, in the meantime, did her shopping, and, having loaded herself with as much as she
     could carry—more than most people could except those Continental maids and mistresses who do
     their own marketing, she started for home. It was a long walk—a long way to Halgrave and a good
     bit beyond that to the cottage. She did not expect to reach the village till dusk, but she
     thought very
     <pb n="258"/> probably she would find her father or Mr. Gillat there; she had suggested that
     one or both of them should come to meet her and help carry the parcels the rest of the way.</p>
    <p>Johnny fell in with the suggestion; she saw him through the twilight before she reached the
     village. Her father, she concluded, was still sulky at her refusal to have his company earlier
     and so would not come now.</p>
    <p>"I suppose father would not come?" she said, as she and Mr. Gillat walked on after a
     readjustment of the burden.</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," Johnny answered; "it was not that; I'm sure he would have come if he had been in
     when I started, but he was not back then."</p>
    <p>"Not back?" Julia repeated. "Why, where has he gone?"</p>
    <p>"Well," Johnny replied slowly, "he said he was going to get fir-cones, but I'm not sure, I
     didn't see him go across the heath. Still, I dare say he went—he took a basket, so I think he
     must have gone."</p>
    <p>Julia apparently did not find this very conclusive evidence. "There is not anywhere much
     about here where he can go," she said; much less as if she were stating a fact than as if she
     were reviewing likely and unlikely places. "There is only the one road, and that goes to
     Halgrave, and there is nowhere for him there."</p>
    <p>"No, oh, no," Johnny said; "there really is nowhere there."</p>
    <p>"There is the 'Dog and Pheasant,'" Julia went on meditatively, "but he would not get anything
     he cared about there."</p>
    <p>"No," Mr. Gillat said decidedly; "besides he would not go there, he would not sit in a small
     country public house and—er—and—sit there—and so on—he would not
     <pb n="259"/> think of going to such a place. It is one thing when you are out in the country
     for a day's fishing or something, to have a glass of ale and a piece of bread and cheese at an
     inn, but the other is quite different; he wouldn't do that—oh, no. To sit in a little bar
     and—"</p>
    <p>"Booze," Julia concluded for him. "Johnny, you are always a wonder to me; how you have
     contrived to live so long and yet to keep your belief in man unspotted from the world beats
     me."</p>
    <p>Johnny looked uncomfortable and a little puzzled. "Well, but your father—" he began.</p>
    <p>"My father is a man," Julia interrupted, "and I would not undertake to say a man would not do
     anything—on occasions—or a woman either, for the matter of that. There is a beast in most men,
     and an archangel in lots, and a snob, and a prig, and a dormant hero, and an embryo poet. There
     are great possibilities in men; you have to watch and see which is coming out top and back
     that, and then half the time you are wrong. Of course, at father's age, possibilities are
     getting over; one or two things have come top and stay there."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat opened the cottage door and, not answering these distressing generalities, fell
     back on his one fact. "Look," he said, pointing to an empty peg, "he must have gone after
     fir-cones; you see the basket has gone; he took it with him; I am sure he would not have taken
     it to the 'Dog.'"</p>
    <p>"I believe their whisky is very bad," Julia said, and seemed to think more of that than the
     argument of the basket. "I'll give him another hour before I set out to look for him."</p>
    <p>She gave him the hour and then, in spite of Mr. Gillat's entreaties to be allowed to go in
     her place, set out for
     <pb n="260"/>Halgrave. But she did not have to go all the way, for she met her father coming
     back. And she early discovered that, if he had not been to the "Dog and Pheasant," he had been
     somewhere else where he could get whisky. They walked home together, and she made neither
     comments nor inquiries; she did not consider that evening a suitable time. The Captain was only
     a little muddled and, as has been before said, a very little alcohol was sufficient to do that;
     he was quite clear enough to be a good deal relieved by his daughter's behaviour, and even
     thought that she noticed nothing amiss. Indeed, by the morning, he had himself almost come to
     think there was nothing to notice.</p>
    <p>But alas, for the Captain! He had never learnt to beware of those deceptive people who bide
     their time and bring into domestic life the diplomatic policy of speaking on suitable occasions
     only. He came down-stairs that morning very well pleased with himself; he felt that he had
     vindicated the rights of man yesterday; this conclusion was arrived at by a rather circuitous
     route, but it was gratifying; it was also gratifying to think that he had been able to enjoy
     himself without being found out. But Julia soon set him right on this last point; she did not
     reproach him or, as Mrs. Polkington would have done, point out the disgrace he would bring upon
     them; she only told him that it must not occur again. She also explained that, while he lived
     in her house, she had a right to dictate in these matters and, what was more, she was going to
     do so.</p>
    <p>At this the Captain was really hurt; his feeling for dignity was very sensitive, though given
     to manifesting itself in unusual ways. "Am I to be dependent for the rest of my days?" he
     asked.</p>
    <p>Julia did not answer; she thought it highly probable.</p>
    <p>"Am I to be dictated to at every turn?" he went on.
     <pb n="261"/></p>
    <p>Julia did answer. "No," she said; "I don't think there will be any need for that."</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington paid no attention to the answer; he was standing before the kitchen fire,
     apostrophising things in general rather than asking questions.</p>
    <p>"Are my goings out and comings in to be limited by my daughter? Am I to ask her permission
     before I accept hospitality or make friends?"</p>
    <p>"Friends?" said Julia. "Then it was not 'The Dog and Pheasant' you went to, yesterday? I
     thought not."</p>
    <p>"Then you thought wrong," her father retorted incautiously; "I did go there."</p>
    <p>"To begin with," Julia suggested; "but you came across some one, and went on—is that it?"</p>
    <p>The Captain denied it, but he had not his wife's and daughters' gifts; his lies were always
     of the cowardly and uninspired kind that seldom serve any purpose. Julia did not believe him,
     and set to work cross questioning him so that soon she knew what she wanted. It seemed that her
     surmise was correct; he had met some one at the "Dog and Pheasant"; a veterinary surgeon who
     had come there to doctor a horse. They had struck up an acquaintance—the Captain had the family
     gift for that—and the surgeon had asked him to come to his house on the other side of
     Halgrave.</p>
    <p>When the information reached this point Julia said suavely, but with meaning: "Perhaps you
     had better not go there again."</p>
    <p>"I shall certainly go when I choose," Captain Polkington retorted; "I should like to know
     what is to prevent me and why I should not?"</p>
    <p>Julia remembered his dignity. "Shall we say because it is too far?" she suggested.</p>
    <p>After that she dismissed the subject; she did not see
     <pb n="262"/> any need to pursue it further; her father knew her wishes—commands, perhaps, he
     called them—all that was left for her to do was to see that he could not help fulfilling them,
     and that was not to be done by much talking any more than by little. So she made no further
     comments on his doings and, to change the subject, told him she had bought some whisky in the
     town yesterday and he had better open the bottle at dinner time.</p>
    <p>The Captain stared for a moment, but quickly recovered from his astonishment, though not
     because he recognised that a little whisky at home was part of a judicious system. He merely
     thought that his daughter was going to treat him properly after all, and in spite of what had
     been lately said. This idea was a little modified when he found that, though he drank the
     whisky, Julia kept the bottle under lock and key.</p>
    <p>It also seemed that she found a way of enforcing her wishes, or at least preventing frequent
     transgressions of them, although, of course, she was prepared for occasional mishaps. There
     really was nothing at the "Dog and Pheasant" that the Captain could put up with even if he had
     not been always very short of money—absurdly short even of coppers—and Julia saw that he was
     short. There remained nothing for him but the hospitality of acquaintances, and they did not
     abound in Halgrave, the only place within reach; also, as he declared, they were a stingy lot.
     The next time he called upon his new friend, the veterinary surgeon, he was at a loss to
     understand this; it was unlike his previous experience of the man and most disagreeably
     surprising; he could not think why it should happen. But then he had not seen Julia set out for
     Halgrave on the afternoon of the same day that she explained things to him. She had on all her
     best clothes, even her best boots, in spite of the bad roads.
     <pb n="263"/> She looked trim and dainty as a Frenchwoman, but there was something about her
     which suggested business.</p>
    <p>There are, no doubt, advantages attached to the simple life. It is decidedly easier to deal
     with your drawback when you do not have to pretend it has no existence. You can enlist help
     from outside if you can go boldly to veterinary surgeons and others, and say that whisky is
     your father's weakness, and would they please oblige and gratify you by not offering him
     any.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
    <head>NARCISSUS TRIANDRUS STRIATUM, THE GOOD COMRADE</head>
    <p>The winter wore away; a very long winter, and a very cold one to those at the cottage who
     were used to the mild west country. But at last spring came; late and with bitter winds and
     showers of sleet, but none the less wonderful, especially as one had to look to see the
     tentative signs of its coming. March in Marbridge used to mean violets and daffodils, tender
     green shoots and balmy middays. March here means days of pale clean light and great sweeping
     wind which chased grey clouds across a steely sky, and stirred the lust for fight and freedom
     in men's minds and set them longing to be up and away and at battle with the world or the
     elements. This restlessness, which those who have lost it call divine, took possession of Julia
     that springtime, and a dissatisfaction with the simple life and its narrow limits beset her.
     Surely, she found herself asking, this was not the end of all things—this cottage to be the
     limit of her life and ambitions; her work to grow cabbages and eat them, to keep her father in
     the paths of temperance and sobriety, and to make Johnny's closing days happy? The March winds
     spoke vaguely of other things; they whispered of the life she had put from her; the big, wide,
     moving, thinking, feeling life which would have been living indeed. Worse, they whispered of
     the man who had offered it to her, the man whom her heart told her she would have made friend
     and comrade if only circumstances had allowed him to
     <pb n="265"/> make her wife. But she thrust these thoughts from her; she had no choice, she
     never had a choice; now less if possible than before, there was no heart-aching decision to
     make. The work she had taken up could not be put down; she must go on even if voices stronger
     and more real than these wind ones called her out.</p>
    <p>One day the crocuses which Mijnheer had sent came into flower; Julia thought she had never
     seen anything so beautiful as the little purple and golden cups, partly because they had been
     sent in kindness of heart, partly, no doubt, because she had grown them herself, and she had
     never grown a flower which had its root in the inarticulate joy of all things at the first
     flowering of dead brown earth and monotonous lifeless days. The next event in her calendar, and
     Johnny's, was the blooming of the fruit trees. She had seen hillside orchards in the west
     country break into a foam of flower—a sight perhaps as beautiful as any England has to show.
     But, to her mind, it did not compare with the sparse white bloom which lay like a first hoar
     frost on her crooked trees and showed cold and delicate against the pale blue sky. After that,
     nearly every day, there was something fresh and interesting for Mr. Gillat and Julia, so that
     the March wind was forgotten, except in the ill-effect on Captain Polkington with whom it had
     disagreed a good deal, both in health and temper.</p>
    <p>That spring, as indeed every spring, there was a flower show in London at the Temple Gardens.
     The things exhibited were principally bulb flowers, ixias, iris, narcissus and the like; the
     event was interesting to growers, both professional and amateur. Joost Van Heigen came over
     from Holland to attend; he was sent by his father in a purely business capacity, but of course
     he was expected, and himself expected, to enjoy it, too; there would be
     <pb n="266"/> many novelties exhibited and many beautiful flowers in which he would feel the
     sober appreciative pleasure of the connoisseur. He came to England some days before the show;
     he had, besides attending that, to see some important customers on business, also one or two
     English growers.</p>
    <p>Now, certain districts of Norfolk are very well suited to the cultivation of bulbs, so it is
     not surprising that Joost's business took him there. And, seeing that he had a Bradshaw and a
     good map, and had, moreover, six months ago addressed Julia's box of bulbs to her nearest
     railway town, it is not surprising that he found the whereabouts of the town of Halgrave. It
     was on Saturday night when he found it on the map; he was sitting in the coffee-room of a
     temperance hotel at the time. He had done business for the day, and, seeing that the English do
     not care about working on Sundays, he would probably have to-morrow as well as to-night free.
     Julia's town was close—a short railway journey, then a walk to Halgrave, and then one would be
     at her home—it would be a pleasant way of spending the morning of a spring Sunday. He thought
     about it a little; he had no invitation to go and see Julia, and he did not like going anywhere
     without an invitation or an express reason. She might not want to see him, or it might put out
     her domestic arrangements if he came; he knew domestic arrangements were subject to such
     disturbances. He hesitated some time, though it must be admitted that the fact that he had
     asked her to marry him and been refused did not come much into his consideration. He had not
     altered his mind about that proposal, and he did not imagine she had altered hers; his devotion
     and her indifference were definite settled facts which would remain as long as either of them
     remained, but there was nothing em
     <pb n="267"/>barrassing in them to him. At last he decided that he would go, and it was the
     blue daffodil which decided him.</p>
    <p>He had never heard what Julia had done with the bulb he had given her. It was only reasonable
     to think she had sold it, seeing it was for the sake of money she had wanted it, but no whisper
     of any such thing had reached him or his father. He longed to know about it, to hear the name
     of the man who had his treasure; for whom, in all probability, it was blooming now. It was some
     connoisseur he was nearly certain; Julia would not have sold it to another grower. He had not
     lain any such condition on her, but she would not have done that; she knew too well what it
     meant to him; he never doubted her in that matter, his faith was of too simple a kind. Still he
     determined to go and see her, partly that he might hear the name of the man who bought the blue
     daffodil, partly because he wanted to and remembered that Julia, in the old days, did not seem
     of the kind to be upset by unexpected visitors and similar small domestic accidents.</p>
    <p>It was a hot-dinner Sunday at the cottage. These occurred alternately; on the in between
     Sundays Julia, supported by Johnny and the Captain, went to church. On those sacred to hot
     dinners she stayed at home and did the cooking, the Captain staying with her. Mr. Gillat used
     to also in the winter, but lately, during the spring, he had been induced to teach in the
     Sunday school, and now went every Sunday to the village, first to teach and afterwards to
     conduct his class to church.</p>
    <p>It was Mr. Stevens, the Rector of Halgrave, who had made this surprising suggestion to Mr.
     Gillat. He, good man, had in the course of time been to see his parishioners at the remote
     cottage, grinding along the deep sandy road on his heavy old tricycle; but it was not during
     the visit that he thought of Johnny as a teacher; it was when
     <pb n="268"/> he made further acquaintance with him at Halgrave. Johnny was the member of the
     party who went most often to the village shop; he liked the expedition, it gave him a feeling
     of importance; he also liked gossiping with the woman who kept the shop, and he dearly loved
     meeting the village children. On one of these occasions, when Johnny was engaged in making
     peace between two little girls—little girls were his specialty—the rector met him and it was
     then it occurred to him that Mr. Gillat might help in the school. It was not much of an honour,
     the school was in rather a bad way just now, and boasted no other teachers than the rector and
     a raspy-tempered girl of sixteen, but Johnny was much flattered. He thought he ought to refuse;
     he was quite sure he could not teach; the idea of his doing so was certainly new and strange;
     he was also sure he was not virtuous enough. But in the end he was persuaded to try; Julia told
     him that he might hear the catechism with an open book, choose the Bible tales he was surest
     of, to read and explain, and have his class of little girls to tea very often. So it came about
     that Mr. Gillat set out Sunday after Sunday to school, and if his reading and expounding of the
     Scriptures was less in accord with modern light than the traditions that held in the childhood
     of the nation, no one minded; the children at Halgrave were not painfully sharp, and they soon
     got to love Mr. Gillat with a friendly lemon-droppish love which was not critical.</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington did not approve of the Sunday-school teaching, especially on those days
     when he had to clean the knives. The Sunday when Joost Van Heigen came was one of these. The
     Captain watched Mr. Gillat's preparations with a disgusted face; at last he remarked, "I wonder
     if you think you do any good by this nonsense?"
     <pb n="269"/></p>
    <p>Johnny, who had got as far as the doorstep, stopped and considered rather as if the idea had
     just occurred to him.</p>
    <p>"There must be teachers," he said at length, looking round at the open landscape; "and there
     aren't many about."</p>
    <p>"You are a fine teacher!" the Captain sneered.</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat rubbed his finger along the edge of the Bible he carried. "I was wild," he
     confessed; "yes, I was, I don't think—but then the rector said—and Julia—"</p>
    <p>His meaning was rather obscure, but possibly the Captain followed it although he did cut him
     short by saying, "I should never have expected it of you; if any one had told me that you, one
     of us, would take to this sort of thing, I would not have believed it. I mean, if they had told
     me in the old days, before things were changed and broken up, when we were still alive and
     things moved at a pace—when a man knew if he were alive or dead and whether it was night or
     morning."</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes," Johnny said, but not altogether as if he regretted the passing of those golden
     days; "things were different then; we didn't think of it then."</p>
    <p>"Teaching in the Sunday school?" the Captain asked. "Not quite! And if we had, we shouldn't
     have thought of coming to it even when we had got old and foolish."</p>
    <p>Johnny looked uncomfortable and unhappy; then a bright idea occurred to him. "There wasn't a
     Sunday school there," he said. "You remember the hill station?"</p>
    <p>Just then Julia called from the house, "Father, I believe we might have a dish of turnip tops
     if you would get them. Johnny, you will be late if you don't start soon."</p>
    <p>Johnny promptly started, and the Captain, less promptly, sauntered away to find a basket for
     the turnip tops,
     <pb n="270"/> muttering the while something about people whose religion took the form of going
     out and leaving others to do the work.</p>
    <p>But by the time Joost Van Heigen arrived, the Captain was quite amiable again. He had had a
     quiet morning with nothing to do after the turnip tops were brought in and the knives cleaned,
     and Johnny had had a long tiring walk home from church in a hot sun and a high wind, which
     Captain Polkington felt to be a just dispensation of Providence to reward those who stopped at
     home and cleaned knives. Joost arrived not long after Mr. Gillat; Julia heard the gate click as
     she was taking the meat from before the fire.</p>
    <p>"Who is that, Johnny?" she asked.</p>
    <p>Johnny, who had just come down-stairs after taking off his Sunday coat, looked out of the
     window.</p>
    <p>"I don't know," he said; "a young man."</p>
    <p>Julia, having deposited the joint on the dish, went to the kitchen door. "Put the meat where
     it will keep hot," she said to Johnny; "I expect it's some one who thinks the last people live
     here still; fortunately there is enough dinner."</p>
    <p>She pushed open the unlatched door and saw the visitor going round to the front. "Joost!" she
     exclaimed. "Why, Joost, is it really you?"</p>
    <p>She ran down the garden path after him and he, turning just before he reached the front door,
     stopped.</p>
    <p>"Good-morning, miss," he said solemnly, removing his hat with a sweep. "I hope I see you
     well. I do not inconvenience you—you are perhaps engaged?"</p>
    <p>"Come in," Julia answered; "I am glad to see you!"</p>
    <p>There was no mistaking the sincerity of her tone; Joost's solemn face relaxed a little. "You
     are not occupied?" he said; "I do not disturb you?"
     <pb n="271"/></p>
    <p>"Yes, occupied in dishing up the dinner," Julia said, "which is just the best of all times
     for you to have come. Johnny!" she called; "Johnny, Joost is here."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat, who had been carefully placing the dish where the cinders would fall into it,
     came to the door.</p>
    <p>"This is Mr. Gillat, a very old friend of mine," Julia explained, and Joost bowed deeply,
     offering his hand and saying, "I hope that you are well, sir."</p>
    <p>Whereupon Mr. Gillat impressed, imitated him as nearly as he could, and Julia looked
     away.</p>
    <p>They had dinner in the kitchen on Sundays as well as week days, they made no difference
     to-day. Joost looked round him once or twice; he had never seen a place like this. It was the
     front kitchen; the cooking and most of the house-work was done in the back one, a big barn-like
     place with doors in all corners. The front one was half a kitchen and half a sitting-room,
     warm-coloured, with red-tiled floor and low ceiling, heavily cross-beamed and hung with herbs
     and a couple of hams, in great contrast to the whiteness of the kitchen at the bulb farm. There
     were brass and copper pots and pans such as he knew, but they reflected an open fire, a dirty
     extravagance unknown to Mevrouw. Joost glanced at the fire, and it is to be feared that he was
     at heart a traitor to his native customs. Then he looked at the open window where the sunshine
     streamed in—as was never permitted in Holland—and he wondered if it really spoilt things very
     much, and, being a florist, thought it certainly would spoil the tulips in the mug that stood
     on the wide sill.</p>
    <p>During dinner they spoke English for the sake of the Captain and Mr. Gillat; Joost spoke
     well, if slowly, with a careful and accurate precision. He also observed much, both of outside
     things, as the fact that Johnny and the Captain cleared the table while Julia sat still, con
     <pb n="272"/>trary to Dutch custom. And also of things less on the surface—as that Julia was
     head of the household and that Captain Polkington was not the impressive and authoritative
     person Mijnheer seemed to think. Concerning this last fact he made no remark when, on his
     return home, he described the ways and customs of Julia's cottage to his parents. The
     description served Mevrouw at least, as representative of all English households ever
     afterwards.</p>
    <p>When dinner was done and everything cleared up, or rather Julia's part, she took Joost into
     the garden.</p>
    <p>"Now," she said in Dutch, "let us come out and talk and look at things."</p>
    <p>They went out and he began to admire her orderly garden and to tell her why this plant had
     done well and that one had failed. He did not speak of the blue daffodil, he thought he could
     better ask about that a little later. She did not speak of it either by name; he and it were so
     inseparably connected in her mind.</p>
    <p>"Come along," she said, when he stopped to look into a tulip to see if its centre was as
     truly black as it should have been. "Come and see it."</p>
    <p>He followed her obediently, but asked what it was he was to see.</p>
    <p>"The blue daffodil, of course," she said.</p>
    <p>He stopped dead. "You have got it here?" he exclaimed. "You have not sold it?"</p>
    <p>"Certainly not."</p>
    <p>"But why—why?" he stared at her in amazement. "You wanted money, it was for that you wanted
     the bulb, to sell; you told me so. Do you not want money now?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," Julia said; "but that is an incurable disease hereditary in our family."</p>
    <p>"You do want money?" he inquired mystified. "This
     <pb n="273"/> inheritance is small, not enough? Why, then, did you not sell the bulb?"</p>
    <p>Julia shrugged her shoulders. "I could not very well," she said.</p>
    <p>"But why not? You thought to do so at one time; your intention was to sell it if you
     had—"</p>
    <p>"Stolen it? Yes, that is quite true, and it would not have mattered then. If I had stolen it
     I might as well have sold it; one dishonourable act feels lonely without another; it generally
     begets another to keep itself company."</p>
    <p>Joost looked at her uncomprehendingly. "But why," he persisted, clinging to the one thing he
     did understand, "why did you not sell it? It was for that I gave it to you, to do with as you
     pleased; I knew you would do only what was right and necessary."</p>
    <p>Julia could have smiled a little at this last word; it seemed as if even Joost had learnt to
     temper right with necessity to suit her dealings, but she only said, "That was one reason why I
     could not sell it. You expected me to do right, so I was obliged to do it; faith begets
     righteousness as dishonour begets dishonour."</p>
    <p>"I do not quite understand," he began, but she cut him short.</p>
    <p>"No," she said; "we always found it difficult to make things quite plain, it is no use trying
     now. Come and see the daffodil, you will understand that, at all events, and better than I do.
     It is not quite fully out yet, but very nearly, and—please don't be disappointed—it is not a
     real true blue daffodil at all."</p>
    <p>She took him to the chosen spot and showed him the plant—a bunch of long narrow leaves rising
     from the brown earth, and in the midst of them a single stalk supporting a partly opened
     flower. In shape it was single,
     <pb n="274"/> like the common wild blossom, only much bigger; but in colour, not blue as was
     expected, but streaked in irregular unblended stripes of pure yellow and pure blue. The marking
     was as hard and unshaded as that of the old-fashioned brown and yellow tulips which children
     call bulls'-eyes, and the effect, though bizarre, was not at all pretty. Julia did not think it
     so, and she did not expect any one else to either; but Joost, when he saw the streaky flower,
     gave a little inarticulate exclamation and, dropping on his knees on the path, lifted the bell
     reverently so that he might look into it.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" he said softly; "ah, it is beautiful, wonderful!" He looked up, and Julia, seeing the
     rapt and humble admiration of his face, forgot that there was something ludicrous in the sight
     of a young man kneeling on a garden path reverently worshipping a striped flower. It was no
     abstract admiration of the beautiful, and no cultivated admiration for the new and strange; it
     was the love of a man for his work and appreciation of success in it, even if the success were
     another's; also, perhaps, in part, the expression of a deep-seated national feeling for
     flowers.</p>
    <p>"Is it what you wished?" Julia asked gently, conscious that she was, as always, a long way
     off from Joost.</p>
    <p>"I did not wish it," he said, "because I did not foresee it. No one could foresee that it
     would come, though it always might. It is a novelty, an accident of nature perhaps, but
     beautiful, wonderful!"</p>
    <p>"Is it a real novelty?" Julia asked. "Just as much as your first blue daffodil was? Oh, I am
     glad! Then you have two now."</p>
    <p>"I?" Joost said in surprise. "No, not I; this is yours, not mine; you have grown it."</p>
    <p>"That's nothing," Julia returned easily; "you gave me
     <pb n="275"/> the bulb; it is really your bulb; I only just put it into the ground, I have had
     nothing to do with the novelty."</p>
    <p>But if she thought to dispose of the matter in that way she soon found she was mistaken;
     there were apparently laws governing bulb growing which were as inviolable as any governing
     hereditary titles. The man who bloomed the bulb was the man who had produced the novelty—if
     novelty it was; he could no more make over his rights to another than a duke could his coronet.
     In vain Julia protested that it was by the merest chance that Joost had hit on this particular
     sort to give her, that it was only an accident which had prevented him from blooming it
     himself. He said that did not matter at all, and when she failed to be convinced, added that
     possibly, had he kept the bulb, the result might not have proved the same; her soil and
     treatment were doubtless both different.</p>
    <p>Julia laughed at the idea, saying she knew nothing about soil and treatment. But she made no
     impression on Joost and apparently did not alter the case; the laws of the bulb growers were
     not only like those of the "Medes and Persians which alter not," but also refused to be bent or
     evaded even by a Polkington.</p>
    <p>"It is yours," Joost said, as he took a last look at the flower before he rose from his
     knees; "the great honour is yours, and I am glad of it."</p>
    <p>There was something in his tone which reminded Julia of that talk they had had in the little
     enclosed place on the last day she was at the bulb farm. She hastily submitted so as to avoid
     the too personal. "What am I to do with the honour?" she asked. "I do not know, that is one
     reason why it is absurd for me to have it."</p>
    <p>"You must name your flower," he told her; "and then you must exhibit it. Fortunately you are
     in time for the show in London."
     <pb n="276"/></p>
    <p>"But I can't go to London," Julia said; "it is out of the question for me to leave home even
     if I could afford the fare, which I cannot."</p>
    <p>Joost answered there was no need; he could arrange everything for her. "I can take the
     daffodil to London with me," he said. "It must be lifted—you have a flower pot, then it must be
     tied with care, and it will travel quite safely."</p>
    <p>"But," Julia objected; "if it is exhibited with my name, and you say my name as the grower
     must appear, your father will hear of it and then he will know that you gave me a bulb—it
     cannot be exhibited. I do not care about a certificate of merit or whatever one gets."</p>
    <p>"It must be exhibited," Joost said; "as to my father, he knows already, I have told him; that
     does not stand in the way."</p>
    <p>To this Julia had nothing to say; perhaps in her heart she was a little ashamed because she
     had suspected him of the half honesty of only telling what was necessary when it was necessary,
     that she herself was likely to have practised in his case.</p>
    <p>"Now you must call your flower a name," he said, "as I called mine Vrouw Van Heigen."</p>
    <gap unit="graphic"/>
    <p>"I will call it after you," Julia said.</p>
    <p>But Joost would not have that. "That will not do; the blue daffodil is already a Van Heigen;
     there cannot be another, it will make confusion."</p>
    <p>"Well, I'll call it the honest man, then; that will be you."</p>
    <p>Joost did not like that either; he thought it very unsuitable. "Why not name it after"—he
     began; he had meant to say "your father," but recalling that gentleman, he changed it to—"some
     one of whom you are fond."</p>
    <p>Julia hesitated. "I like the honest man," she said;
     <pb n="277"/>"but as you say it is not suitable, the blue daffodil is really the honest one,
     this is too mixed—I shall call it after Johnny; I am fond of him."</p>
    <p>But Joost was romantic; it was only natural with the extreme and almost childish simplicity
     of his nature there should be some romance, and there was nothing to satisfy that sentiment in
     Mr. Gillat. "Johnny?" he said; "yes, but it is not very pretty; it does not suggest a beautiful
     flower. Why not call it after the heroine of some book or a friend or comrade? Perhaps"—Joost
     was only human—"he with whom you went walking on the Dunes."</p>
    <p>"Him?" Julia said. "I never thought of that. He was a friend certainly, and a good comrade;
     he tried hard to get me out of that scrape; he would have stood by me if I had let him—the same
     as you did—you were both comrades to me then. I tell you what, shall I call it 'The Good
     Comrade?' Then it would be after you both and Johnny too; Johnny would certainly stand by me
     through thick and thin, share his last crust with me, or father, give me the whole of it. Yes,
     we will call the daffodil 'The Good Comrade,' and it shall have three godfathers."</p>
    <p>With this Joost was satisfied, even though he had to share what honour there was with two
     others. Mr. Gillat, of course, when he was told, was much pleased; he even found he was now
     able to admire the wonderful flower, though before, he had agreed with Julia's opinion of it.
     To Captain Polkington not much was said about it.</p>
    <p>"Johnny," Julia said, as they stood watching Joost pot the bulb, "you are not to tell father
     how valuable this is. He will find out quite soon enough; people are sure to bother me to sell
     it after it has been exhibited, and I am not going to."</p>
    <p>"No," Johnny said; "of course not, naturally not."
     <pb n="278"/></p>
    <p>So Captain Polkington had no idea why Joost carried away a carefully tied-up flower pot when
     he left the cottage that afternoon. He only thought the young man must have a most remarkable
     enthusiasm for flowers to so burden himself on a long walk.</p>
    <p>And in due time the wonderful streaked daffodil, "Narcissus Triandrus Striatum, The Good
     Comrade," grown by Miss Snooks of White's Cottage, Halgrave, was exhibited at the Temple Show.
     And bulb growers, professional and amateur, waxed enthusiastic over it. And the general public
     who went to the show, admired it or not, as their taste and education allowed them. And among
     the general public who went, was a Miss Lillian Farham, a girl who, last September, had
     travelled north with carnations in her coat and Rawson-Clew in a corner of the railway
     carriage. Miss Farham was an enthusiastic gardener, and having means and leisure and a real
     taste for it, she had some notable successes in the garden of her beautiful home; and when she
     was in town she never missed an opportunity of attending a good show, seeing something new, and
     learning what she could. She was naturally much interested in the new streaked daffodil; so
     much so, that she spoke of it afterwards, not only to those people who shared her taste, but
     also to at least one who did not.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew was back in London. He had not been back long, but already he had begun the
     preliminaries of a search for Mr. Gillat. He decided that it would be easier to find him than
     Julia, who might possibly have changed her name to oblige her family, and who certainly would
     be better able to hide herself, if she had a mind to, than Mr. Gillat. He had not as yet been
     able to devote many days to the search, and had got no further than
     <pb n="279"/> preliminaries; still he could already see that it was not going to be easy and
     might possibly be long. He did not go to the show of spring flowers; he did not feel the least
     interest in it, but when by chance he met Lillian Farham she spoke of it to him and also of the
     new daffodil.</p>
    <p>"It was grown at Halgrave, too," she said; "that is not so very far from your part of
     Norfolk, is it?"</p>
    <p>"Fifteen or twenty miles," Rawson-Clew answered.</p>
    <p>"Is it so much as that?" she said; "I thought it was nearer; of course, then, you can't tell
     me anything about the grower."</p>
    <p>He could not; it is probable even if the place had been much nearer, he still could not,
     seeing that it was some years since he had been to "his part of Norfolk." However, he gave
     polite attention to Miss Farham, who went on to describe the wonderful flower of mixed yellow
     and blue.</p>
    <p>"Blue?" Rawson-Clew's interest became more real; he had once heard of blue in connection with
     a daffodil. It was one evening on a long flat Dutch road—the evening he had tied Julia's shoe.
     She had spoken of it, she had begun to say, when he stopped the confession that he thought she
     would afterwards regret, that she could not take the blue daffodil.</p>
    <p>"What is the name?" he asked; he meant of the grower in Norfolk, though he would have been
     puzzled to say why he asked.</p>
    <p>Miss Farham, however, mistook his meaning and thought he was asking about the flower. "'The
     Good Comrade,'" she said, and fortunately she did not see his surprise. "Rather quaint, is it
     not?" she went on. "Easier to remember, too, than some obscure grand duchess, or the name of
     the grower or his wife after whom
     <pb n="280"/>new flowers are usually called. The blue daffodil, you know, is called after one
     of the grower's relatives—Vrouw Van Heigen."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew said "Yes," though he did not know it before. It struck him as interesting now;
     the Van Heigens had a blue daffodil then, and Julia went to them for some purpose besides
     earning a pittance as companion. She had not taken a blue daffodil; she said so; she also said
     at another time she had failed in the object of her coming and that failure and success would
     have been alike discreditable. Poor Julia! And now here was some one in Norfolk exhibiting a
     daffodil of mixed blue and yellow called, by a strange coincidence, "The Good Comrade." Of
     course, it was only a coincidence and yet, when reason is not helping as much as it ought, one
     is inclined to take notice of signs and coincidences.</p>
    <p>"What is the name of the grower of this new flower?" Rawson-Clew asked.</p>
    <p>Miss Farham told him.</p>
    <p>"Snooks," he repeated thoughtfully; she imagined he was trying to remember if he had heard
     the name before. He was not; he was wondering if any one ever really started in life with such
     a name; if, rather, it did not sound more like the pseudonym of one who was indifferent to
     public credence, and possibly public opinion.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew was not able to tell Miss Farham anything about the grower of the streaked
     daffodil; he was obliged to own that he had never heard of her before. But he made it his
     business to find out what he could in the shortest possible time; this he did not mention to
     Miss Farham. What he discovered did not amount to much, very little in fact, but such as it
     was, it was enough to bring him to Halgrave.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
    <head>BEHIND THE CHOPPING-BLOCK</head>
    <p>Captain Polkington, Johnny and Julia were busy in the garden. It was a fine afternoon
     following after two or three wet days and the ground was in splendid condition for planting,
     also for sticking to clothes. The sandy road to Halgrave dried quickly, but the garden, of
     heavier soil, did not, as was testified by Julia's boots—she had bought a small pair of
     plough-boy's boots that spring and was wearing them now, very pleased with the investment. By
     and by the sound of a motor broke the silence; the Captain and Johnny left off work to listen;
     at least, Johnny did; the Captain was hardly in a position to leave off, seeing that he was off
     most of his time.</p>
    <p>"It sounds like a motor-car," Johnny said, as if he had made a discovery.</p>
    <p>"Then it must have lost its way," Julia answered, giving all her attention to her cabbage
     plants.</p>
    <p>Johnny said "Yes." It certainly seemed likely enough; the ubiquitous motor-car went
     everywhere certainly; even, it was possible to imagine, to remote and uninteresting Halgrave.
     But along the ill-kept sandy road which led to White's Cottage and nowhere else, none had been
     yet, nor was it in the least likely that one would ever come except by accident.</p>
    <p>The sounds drew nearer. "It certainly is coming this
     <pb n="282"/> way," the Captain said; "I will go and explain the mistake to the people."</p>
    <p>The Captain went to the gate; but he did not stop there, nor did he explain anything. His
     eyesight, never having been subjected to strain or over work, was good, and the car, owing to
     the loose nature of the road, was not coming very fast; he saw it had only one occupant, a man
     who seemed familiar to him. For a second the Captain stared, then he turned and went into the
     house in surprising haste. He had not the least idea what had brought this man here; indeed,
     when he came to think about it, he was sure it must have been some mistake about the road. But
     he had no desire to explain; he felt he was not the person to do so, seeing that the last (and
     first) time he had seen the man was in an unpleasant interview at Marbridge. He connected
     several painful things, humiliation, undeserved epithets, and so on, with that interview and
     with the face of Rawson-Clew. Accordingly, he went into the house and waited, and the car came
     nearer and stopped.</p>
    <p>Johnny and Julia went on with their work; they imagined the Captain was talking to the
     strangers; they had no idea of his discreet withdrawal until Julia came round the corner of the
     house to fetch a trowel, and saw Rawson-Clew coming up the path.</p>
    <p>Julia's first feeling was blank amazement, but being a Polkington, and being that before she
     took to the simple life and its honest ways, she allowed nothing more than polite surprise to
     appear.</p>
    <p>"Why!" she said, "I had no idea you were anywhere near here."</p>
    <p>"I had no idea that you were until recently," he returned.
     <pb n="283"/></p>
    <p>She wondered how recently; if it was this minute when chance brought her for the trowel—very
     likely it was, and he was here by accident.</p>
    <p>"Have you lost your way?" she inquired.</p>
    <p>"Not to-day."</p>
    <p>"Where were you trying to go?"</p>
    <p>"White's Cottage."</p>
    <p>"Oh!" she said. He did not look amused, but she felt as if he were, and clearly it was not
     accident that had brought him.</p>
    <p>"How did you know I was here?" she asked. "There are not many people who could have told you.
     I have retired, you know."</p>
    <p>He settled his eyeglass carefully in the way she remembered, and looked first at the cottage
     and then at her. "I observe the retirement," he said; "but the corduroy?"</p>
    <p>"I am wearing out my old clothes first," she answered.</p>
    <p>Just then Johnny's voice was heard. "Hadn't I better water the plants?" it asked. Next moment
     Mr. Gillat came in sight carrying a big water can. "Julia hadn't I better—" he began, then he
     saw the visitor.</p>
    <p>"Ah, Mr. Gillat," Rawson-Clew said. "How are you? I am glad to see you again; last time I
     called at Berwick Street you were not there."</p>
    <p>Johnny set down the water can. "Glad to see you," he said beaming; "very glad, very glad,
     indeed"—he would have been pleased to see Rawson-Clew anywhere if for no other reason than that
     he had shown an interest in Julia's welfare.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Captain Polkington sat in the kitchen listening for the sound of the departing
     motor. But it did not come; everything was still except for the ceaseless singing of larks, to
     which he was so used now that it had
     <pb n="284"/>come almost to seem like silence. He began to grow uneasy; what if, after all,
     Rawson-Clew were not here by accident and mistake. What if he had come on some wretched and
     uncomfortable business? The Captain could not think of anything definite, but that, he felt,
     did not make it impossible. The man certainly had not gone, he must be staying talking to
     Julia. Well, Julia could talk to him, she was more fit to see the business through than her
     father was. There was some comfort in this thought, but it did not last long, for just then the
     silence was broken, there was a sound of steps, not going down the path to the gate, but coming
     towards the kitchen door! The Captain rose hastily—it was too bad of Julia, too bad! He was not
     fit for these shocks and efforts; he was not what he used to be; the terrible cold of the
     winter in this place had told on his rheumatism, on his heart. He crossed the room quickly. The
     door which shut in the staircase banged as that of the big kitchen was pushed open.</p>
    <p>"You had better take your boots off here, Johnny," Julia said; "you have got lots of mud on
     them."</p>
    <p>She took off her own as she spoke, slipping out of them without having much trouble with the
     laces. Rawson-Clew watched her, finding a somewhat absurd satisfaction in seeing her small
     arched feet free of the clumsy boots.</p>
    <p>"Are not your stockings wet?" he said.</p>
    <p>"No," she answered; "not a bit."</p>
    <p>"Are you quite sure? I think they must be."</p>
    <p>"No, they are not; are they, Johnny?" She stood on one foot and put the other into Mr.
     Gillat's hand.</p>
    <p>Johnny felt it carefully, giving it the same consideration that a wise housekeeper gives to
     the airing of sheets, then he gave judgment in favour of Julia.</p>
    <p>"I was right, you see," she said; "they are quite dry."
     <pb n="285"/></p>
    <p>She looked up as she spoke, and met Rawson-Clew's eyes; there was something strange there,
     something new which brought the colour to her face. She went quickly into the other kitchen and
     began to get the tea.</p>
    <p>Johnny came to help her, and the visitor offered his assistance, too. Julia at once sent the
     latter to the pump for water, which she did not want. When he came back she had recovered
     herself, had even abused herself roundly for imagining this new thing or misinterpreting it.
     There was no question of man and woman between her and Rawson-Clew; there never had been and
     never could be (although he had asked her to marry him). It was all just impersonal and
     friendly; it was absurd or worse to think for an instant that he had another feeling, had any
     feeling at all—any more than she. And again she abused herself, perhaps because it is not easy
     to be sure of feelings, either your own or other people's, even if you want to, and it
     certainly is not easy to always want what you ought. Moreover, there was a difference; it was
     impossible to overlook it, she felt in herself or him, or both. She had altered since they
     parted at the Van Heigens', perhaps grown to be a woman. After all she was a woman, with a
     great deal of the natural woman in her, too, he had said—and he was a man, a gentleman, first,
     perhaps, polished and finished, her senior, her superior—yet a man, possibly with his share of
     the natural man, the thing on which one cannot reckon. Just then the kettle boiled and she made
     the tea.</p>
    <p>"Where is father?" she asked; and Mr. Gillat went to look for him.</p>
    <p>"He is up-stairs," he said when he came back; "he does not feel well, he says, not the thing;
     he'll have tea up there; I'll take it."
     <pb n="286"/></p>
    <p>Julia looked at Rawson-Clew and laughed. "He does not feel equal to facing you," she
     said.</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes," Johnny added, "that's it; that's what he says—I mean"—suddenly realising what he
     was saying—"he does not feel equal to facing strangers."</p>
    <p>"Mr. Rawson-Clew is not a stranger," Julia answered; she took a perverse delight in recalling
     the beginning of the acquaintance which she knew quite well was better ignored. "How odd," she
     said, turning to Rawson-Clew, "that father should have forgotten you, just as you told me you
     had forgotten him and all about the time when you saw him."</p>
    <p>"I expect he regarded the matter as trivial and unimportant, just as I did," Rawson-Clew
     answered; "though if I told you I had forgotten all about it I made a mistake; I can hardly say
     that; I remember some details quite plainly; for instance, your position—you stood between your
     father and me—very much as you did between me and the Van Heigens."</p>
    <p>"I did not!" Julia said hotly, pouring the tea all over the edge of the cup; "I didn't stand
     between you and the Van Heigens. I mean—"</p>
    <p>"Allow me!" Rawson-Clew moved the cup so that she poured the tea into it and not the
     saucer.</p>
    <p>"Dear, dear!" Johnny said; he had not the least idea what they were talking about, but he
     fancied that one or both must be annoyed, perhaps by the upsetting of the tea; he could think
     of nothing else. "Such a mess," he said; "and such a waste. Is the cup ready? Shall I take it
     up-stairs?"</p>
    <p>"No, thank you," Julia said; "I will take it."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew did not seem to mind, and Julia, after she had lingered a little with her father,
     decided to come
     <pb n="287"/>down again. If she stayed away she knew perfectly well that Johnny would do
     nothing but talk about her; moreover it was absurd to be put out because Rawson-Clew could
     answer better than Mr. Gillat; that was one of the reasons for which she had liked him.</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington sipped his tea and ate his bread and butter peacefully. Julia had told him
     Mr. Rawson-Clew would not be staying long; she had not exactly said why he was come, it seemed
     rather as if she did not know; but apparently nothing unpleasant had happened so far and he
     would be going soon, directly after tea no doubt. So the Captain sat contentedly and listened
     for the sound of going, but he did not hear it; they were a very long time over tea, he
     thought.</p>
    <p>They were; two of them were purposely spinning it out, the third was only a happy chorus.
     Julia was in no hurry to face the questions about the explosive which she feared must come when
     Johnny's restraining presence was removed. She knew, as soon as she was sure Rawson-Clew's
     coming was design and not accident, that he must have suspected her; he had come to talk about
     it and he would do so as soon as he got the chance, so she put it off. And he was quite willing
     to wait too; he was enjoying the present moment with a curious light-hearted enjoyment much
     younger than his years. And he was enjoying the future moment, too, in anticipation, albeit he
     was a little shy of it—he did not quite know how he was to close with the garrison in the
     citadel even though he might have taken all the outposts.</p>
    <p>But at last tea was done and the table cleared and all the things taken to the outer kitchen
     to be washed. Julia decreed that she and Johnny were to do that, then unthinkingly she sent her
     assistant for a tea-cloth. Rawson-Clew was standing by the doorway when Johnny passed; he
     followed him out.
     <pb n="288"/></p>
    <p>"Mr. Gillat, your plants want watering," he said, quietly but decisively.</p>
    <p>"They do, they do," Johnny agreed; "I will have to do them by and by."</p>
    <p>"Do them now, it is getting late."</p>
    <p>"It is," Mr. Gillat admitted; "we were late with tea, but there's the drying of the
     cups."</p>
    <p>"I will do that."</p>
    <p>Johnny hesitated; Julia's wish was his law, still there seemed no harm in the exchange;
     anyhow, without quite knowing how it happened, he soon afterwards found himself in the garden
     among the water cans.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew went back to the outer kitchen. Julia looked round as she heard his step, and
     seeing that he was alone, recognised the manœuvre and the arrival of the inevitable hour.</p>
    <p>"Well," she said, coming to the point in a business-like way now that it was unavoidable;
     "what is it you want?"</p>
    <p>"I want to know several things," he said, shutting the door. "Principally why you called your
     daffodil 'The Good Comrade?'"</p>
    <p>"The daffodil!" she repeated in frank amazement; she was completely surprised, and for once
     she did not attempt to hide it.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Rawson-Clew said; "why did you call it 'The Good Comrade?'"</p>
    <p>Julia began to recover herself and also her natural caution. This was not the question she
     expected, but the rogue in her made her wary even of the seemingly simple and safe. "I called
     it after three friends," she said, "who were good comrades to me—you, Johnny and Joost Van
     Heigen. Why do you ask?"</p>
    <p>"Because I wondered if it was a case of telepathy; I also named something 'The Good Comrade.'"
     <pb n="289"/></p>
    <p>"You?" she said. "What did you name? Was it a dog?"</p>
    <p>"No, a bottle—small, wide-necked, stopper fastened with a piece of torn handkerchief, about
     two-thirds full of a white powder!"</p>
    <p>Julia had begun washing the cups; she did her best to betray no sign, and really she did it
     very well; her eyelids flickered a little and her breath came rather quickly, nothing more.</p>
    <p>"Why did you name it?" she asked. "It is rather odd to do so, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>"I named it after the person who gave it to me."</p>
    <p>Julia's breath came a little quicker; she forgot to remark that the same reason had helped
     her in naming her flower; she was busy asking herself if he meant her by the good comrade.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I did not exactly name my bottle," he went on to say, "but it stood for the person
     to me. It was a sort of physical manifestation—rather a grotesque one, perhaps—of a spiritual
     presence which had not really left me since a certain sunny morning last year."</p>
    <p>"That is very interesting," Julia managed to say; her native caution had not misled her; the
     innocently beginning talk had taken a devious way to the expected end.</p>
    <p>"It was interesting," Rawson-Clew said, "but not quite satisfying, at least not to the
     natural man. He is not content with a manifestation any more than with a spiritual presence; he
     wants a corporal fact."</p>
    <p>Julia looked up; the talk was taking an unforseen turn that she did not quite follow, so she
     looked up. And then she read something in his face that set her heart beating, that made her
     afraid, less perhaps of him than of herself, and the thrill that ran like fire through her body.
     <pb n="290"/></p>
    <p>"I don't quite understand," she said, and dropped a cup.</p>
    <p>It was meant to fall on the flagged floor and break; it would create a diversion, and picking
     up the pieces would give her time to get used to the suffocating heart-beats. She had enough of
     the Polkington self-mastery left to think of the manœuvre and its advisability, but not enough
     to carry it out properly; the cup fell on the doubled-up tea-cloth that lay at her feet and was
     not broken at all. Nevertheless the incident and her own contempt for her failure steadied her
     a little.</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew picked up the cup. "Do you not understand," he said. "It is quite simple; I have
     put it to you before, too—not in the same words, but it comes to the same—the plain terms used
     then were—will you do me the honour of becoming my wife?"</p>
    <p>Julia's heart seemed to stop for a second, then it went on heavily as before, but she only
     asked, "Did you not get my letter, the one I wrote in Holland about that?"</p>
    <p>"The one when you told me of your arrangements? By the way you did not mention that you were
     going to Van de Greutz's for the explosive, yes, I got that, but it was scarcely an
     answer."</p>
    <p>"I explained that it meant 'no.'"</p>
    <p>"In a postscript; you cannot answer a proposal of marriage in a postscript."</p>
    <p>There really does not seem sufficient ground to justify this statement, still she did not
     combat it. "Can't I?" she said. "Then I will answer it now—no. It was good of you to offer,
     generous and honourable, but, of course, I should not accept. I mean, I could not even if there
     had been any need, and, as you see, there was not a particle of need then, still less now."</p>
    <p>"No need, no," he answered, and there was a new note
     <pb n="291"/> in his voice; "it is not a case of necessity or anything of the sort. Put all
     that nonsense of justice and honour and gratitude out of the question, you know that it does
     not come in. I own it did weigh somewhat then, but now—now I want the good comrade; I don't
     deserve her, or a tithe of what she has done for me, but I can't do without her—herself, the
     corporal fact—don't you know that?"</p>
    <p>"No," Julia said; somehow it was all she could say.</p>
    <p>"You don't know it? Then I'll tell you." But he did not for she prevented him.</p>
    <p>"Please don't," she said. "You cannot really want me because you do not really know me. Oh,
     no, you do not!"</p>
    <p>"I think I do; I know enough to begin with; the rest of the ignorance you can remedy at your
     leisure."</p>
    <p>"My leisure is now," she said; "I will tell you several things, I will tell you how I got the
     explosive. I went as a cook and stole like a thief—you could have got it as easily as I if you
     would have stooped as readily as I did. You admire that? Perhaps so, now, but you would not if
     you had seen it being done. That is the sort of thing I do, and I will tell you the sort of
     thing I like. The day I came home from Holland I did what I liked—as soon as I reached London I
     went to Johnny Gillat, my dear old friend, who I love better than any one else in the world,
     and we had a supper of steak and onions in a back bedroom, and we enjoyed it—you see what my
     tastes are? Afterwards I heard how father had taken to drink and mother had got into debt—you
     see what a nice family we are?"</p>
    <p>But here Rawson-Clew stopped her. "I knew something like this before," he said; "the details
     are nothing; I do not see what it has to do with the matter."
     <pb n="292"/></p>
    <p>"It ought to have a lot," she answered. "But even if you do know it and a good deal more and
     realise it too, which is a different thing, there is still the other side. I don't know you, I
     don't even know your name."</p>
    <p>Then he remembered that he must have signed that offer of marriage, as he signed all letters,
     and so left himself merely "H. F. Rawson-Clew" to her.</p>
    <p>"You see," she was saying, "it is a mistake for people who don't know each other very well to
     marry, they would always be getting unpleasant surprises afterwards. Besides, it would be so
     uncomfortable; it must be pretty bad to live at close quarters with some one you were—who you
     didn't know very well, with whom you minded about things."</p>
    <p>She had touched on something that did matter now, that might matter very much indeed;
     Rawson-Clew realised it, and realised with a start of pain, that there might be a great gulf
     between him and the good comrade after all. Her quick intuitions and perceptions had bridged it
     over and led him to forget that he was a man of years and experience while she was a girl, a
     young, shy, half-wild thing, veiled, and fearing to draw the veil for his experienced eyes.</p>
    <p>"Tell me," he said, facing her and looking very grave and old, "is that how you feel about
     me?"</p>
    <p>She fidgeted the tea-cloth with her foot, but being a Polkington, she was able to answer
     something. "We belong to different lots of people," she said, examining the shape the thing had
     taken on the floor; "I have got my life here, working in my garden and so on; and you have got
     yours a long way off among greater things."</p>
    <p>"You have not answered me," he said. "Tell me—am I the man you described?"</p>
    <p>He turned her so that she could look at him, the thing
     <pb n="293"/> she dared not do. His touch was light, almost momentary, but it was too much, it
     thrilled through her wildly, irresistibly, and she drew back fearing to do anything else.</p>
    <p>"Don't!" she said, and her voice was sharp with the anger of pain.</p>
    <p>He stepped back a pace. "Thank you," he said; "I am answered."</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington had been dozing; there really was nothing else to do; but suddenly he was
     aroused; there was a sound below; the motor moving at last. Yes, it was going, really going; he
     went to the window and, taking care not to be seen, watched the car go down the sandy road.
     After that he went down-stairs, and finding Johnny, who had finished his watering, persuaded
     him to come for a stroll on the heath. They took a basket to bring home anything they might
     find, and shouted news of their intention to Julia, who did not answer, then set out.</p>
    <p>Now, in the present state of their development, motors are not things on which a man can
     always rely. More especially is this the case when any one like Mr. Gillat has had anything to
     do with them. The obliging Johnny, had arranged the inside of Rawson-Clew's car, covering up
     what he thought might be hurt by the sun and blowing sand while it stood at the roadside, and
     taking into the house when he went in to tea, anything that could be stolen if—as was quite out
     of the question—one came that way with a mind to steal. Johnny had brought back most of the
     things and replaced them before Rawson-Clew started, but not quite all. When the car had got a
     little distance down the road it, with a perversity worthy of a reasonable being, developed a
     need for the forgotten item. Rawson-Clew searched for it, could not find it,
     <pb n="294"/> discovered that he could not get on without it, and, thinking if not saying
     something not very complimentary about Mr. Gillat, walked back to the cottage.</p>
    <p>He supposed he would find Johnny in the garden, but he did not; he and the Captain were some
     way out on the heath now, and, fortunately for the latter's peace, neither saw any one approach
     the cottage. Rawson-Clew looked round the garden and finding no one decided, rather
     reluctantly, that he must go to the house. He did not want to meet Julia again; he thought it
     rather unlikely that she should still be in the kitchen, but there was a chance of it, so he
     approached with a view to reconnoitering before presenting himself. The outer kitchen, which
     partook rather of the nature of a wash-house, had a large unglazed window; when he drew near to
     this he heard a noise from within. It sounded like some one sobbing, not quiet sobs, but slow
     deep spasmodic ones like the last remains of a tempest of tears which has not spent itself but
     only been imperfectly suppressed by sheer will. Rawson-Clew paused though possibly he had no
     business to do so.</p>
    <p>"Oh, why," one wailed from within, "why is not father dead? If he were dead—if only he had
     been dead!"</p>
    <p>The unglazed window was large and rather high up, but Rawson-Clew was a man of fair height;
     he was also usually considered an honourable one, but when he heard the voice, saying something
     which was plainly only meant for the hearing of Omnipotence, he did not go away. He put his
     hands on the flintwork of the window-sill and in a moment found himself in the twilight of the
     unceiled kitchen.</p>
    <p>Julia was crouching in a corner, her elbows on the old chopping-block, her face hidden on her
     tightly-clenched hands, while she struggled angrily with the shaking sobs.
     <pb n="295"/> For a moment she struggled, then mastered herself somehow and looked up, perhaps
     because she meant to rise and set about her work. She had been crying hard and tears do not
     improve the average face, certainly they did not hers; and she had been trying hard to stop,
     cramming a screwed-up handkerchief into her eyes and that did not improve matters either. One
     would have said her face could have expressed nothing but the extremity of unbecoming woe, yet
     when she caught sight of Rawson-Clew standing just under the window it changed extraordinarily
     and to anger.</p>
    <p>"Go away!" she said; "go away! Do you hear?"</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew did not go away; he came nearer and Julia drew further into the corner,
     ensconsing herself behind the chopping-block, and looking about as inviting of approach as a
     trapped rat.</p>
    <p>"Julia," he said.</p>
    <p>"Go away!" was her only answer.</p>
    <p>"Why did you send me away?"</p>
    <p>"Because I wanted you gone."</p>
    <p>"Because Captain Polkington is not dead? Is that it?"</p>
    <p>"You are a dishonourable eavesdropper! No, it wasn't that."</p>
    <p>He sat down on the chopping-block barricading her corner so that she could not get out
     without stepping over him. "Do you know it strikes me that you are not strictly honest either,
     at least not strictly truthful just now."</p>
    <p>Julia tugged at her skirt; the chopping-block was on the hem and he on it so that she could
     not get free. "Will you please go," she said, with a catch in her breath. That is the worst of
     these half-suppressed, unspent storms
     <pb n="296"/> of tears, they have such a tendency to return and break out again
     inconveniently.</p>
    <p>"If it were not for Captain Polkington would you have sent me away?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Y—e—s," she answered, fighting with her tears. "Oh, go! Please, please go!"</p>
    <p>She crumpled herself into a small miserable heap and he leaned over the block and drew her
     into his arms.</p>
    <p>For a moment she struggled, burrowing her head into his coat; there was a good deal of
     burrowing and not much struggling. "No, you wouldn't," he said to her hair, "you would have
     married me."</p>
    <p>"I might have said I would, but I shouldn't really have done it," she contended without
     looking up. "I shouldn't when it came to the point. You had better let me go, I am spoiling
     your coat, my face is all wet—and I don't know where my handkerchief is."</p>
    <p>"Take mine, you will find it somewhere. Tell me, why would you not have married me when it
     came to the point? Because your courage failed you?"</p>
    <p>No answer; then, "I can't find that handkerchief."</p>
    <p>"You have not tried. Are you afraid to try? Are you afraid of me? Is that why you would not
     have married me—you would have been afraid to live at close quarters with me? Do you still
     think you don't know me well enough?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know your name."</p>
    <p>The answer was ridiculous, but he knew how the ridiculous touched even tragedies for
     Julia.</p>
    <p>"Hubert Farquhar Rawson-Clew," he said solemnly. "Now—"</p>
    <p>But whatever was to have followed was prevented, for at that moment she looked up, and for
     some reason, sud
     <pb n="297"/>denly decided things had gone far enough, and so freed herself.</p>
    <p>"I don't think it matters much what I should have done," she said, "or why, either. Father is
     not dead; you ought to know better than to talk about such a thing; it is bad taste."</p>
    <p>"Does that matter in the simple life? I thought when you retired you were going to dispense
     with falsity and pretences, and say and do honestly what you honestly thought, when it did not
     hurt other people's feelings."</p>
    <p>"So I do," she answered; "that is why, when I thought I was alone just now, I asked out loud
     how it was that father was still alive. Since then I have seen."</p>
    <p>"What have you seen?"</p>
    <p>"That it is to prevent me from making a great muddle of things. If he had been dead I dare
     say I should have married you—I may as well confess it since you know—and we both should have
     repented it ever afterwards. As it is, if I were free to-morrow, I would know better than to do
     it."</p>
    <p>He did not seem much troubled by the last statement. "We should have had to talk things
     over," he said.</p>
    <p>"No, talking wouldn't have been any good," she answered; "there is a great distance between
     us."</p>
    <p>He looked down at the space of red tiles that separated them. "That is rather remediable," he
     observed.</p>
    <p>"Do you think I am not in earnest?" she said. "I am. There is a real barrier; besides all
     these things I have mentioned there is something else that cuts me off. I have a debt to pay
     you and until it is paid, if I were your own cousin, I could not stand on the same
     platform."</p>
    <p>"A debt?" he repeated the word in surprise. His young cousin's loan to Captain Polkington had
     slipped his memory, and even if it had not, its connection with the
     <pb n="298"/> present would not have occurred to him. Julia had been there, it is true, when
     the affair was talked of eighteen months ago, and he himself had unofficially paid the money to
     end the matter, but he never dreamed of connecting either her or himself with it now. Still
     less would he have dreamed that she considered herself bound to pay him what her father had
     borrowed from another.</p>
    <p>"What debt?" he asked, thinking the word must be hyperbolical, and meant to stand for
     something quite different, though he could not imagine what.</p>
    <p>"You have forgotten?" she said. "I thought you had; that only shows the distance more
     plainly; you have one standard for yourself and another for me."</p>
    <p>"Tell me what it is and let us see if we cannot compound it."</p>
    <p>But she shook her head. "It can't be compounded," she said; "you will know when I pay
     it."</p>
    <p>"And when will that be?"</p>
    <p>"Ten years, twenty perhaps, I don't know. I thought once or twice before I could pay it—with
     the blue daffodil once, and once when I first got the cottage and things—I thought, to be sure,
     I could do it; it seemed a Heaven-sent way. But"—with a little glint of self-derision—"Heaven
     knows better than to send those sort of easy ways to the Polkingtons; they are ill-conditioned
     beasts who only behave when they are properly laden by fate, and not often then. Now you know
     all about it, so won't you say good-bye and go?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know about it and, what is more, I don't care. I am not going to let this unknown
     trifle, this scruple—"</p>
    <p>Just then there came the sound of voices outside; Mr. Gillat and Captain Polkington unwarily
     coming back before the coast was clear.
     <pb n="299"/></p>
    <p>"Yes," Johnny was saying, "he came to see me in town, you know—or rather you, but you were
     out—"</p>
    <p>"He came to see me? He"—there was no mistaking the consternation in the Captain's tone, nor
     his meaning either.</p>
    <p>Julia and Rawson-Clew looked at one another; both had forgotten the Captain's existence for a
     moment; now they were reminded, and though the reminder seemed incongruous it was perhaps
     opportune.</p>
    <p>"There is father," Julia said.</p>
    <p>And he nodded. One cannot make love to a man's daughter almost in his presence, when the
     proviso of his death is an essential to any satisfaction. Rawson-Clew went to the door.
     "Good-bye," he said, "for the present."</p>
    <p>"Good-bye for always," she answered.</p>
    <p>She spoke quite calmly, in much the same tone when, on the morning after the excursion to the
     Dunes, she had bid him good-bye and tried to face the consequences alone. She had had so many
     tumbles with fate that it seemed she knew how to take them now with an indifferent face. At
     least, nearly always, not quite—the wood block still lay before the corner in which she had
     crouched the marks on his coat where her tears had fallen were hardly dry. There was passion
     and to spare behind the indifferent face, passion that for once at least had broken through the
     self-mastery.</p>
    <p>He held out his hand and she put hers into it. "Good-bye," he repeated; "good-bye for the
     present, brave little comrade."</p>

    <p>Captain Polkington was watching a pan of jam. It was the middle of the day and warm; too warm
     to be at work out of doors, as Johnny was, at least so the Captain thought. He also thought it
     too warm to watch jam in the back kitchen and that occupation, though it was the cooler of the
     two, had the further disadvantage of being beneath his dignity. The dignity was suffering a
     good deal; was it right, he asked himself, that he, the man of the house, should have the
     menial task of watching jam while Julia talked business with some one in the parlour? He did
     not know what business this person had come on; he had seen him arrive a few minutes back, had
     even heard his name—Mr. Alexander Cross—but that was all he knew about him; Julia had taken him
     into the parlour and shut the door. Naturally her father felt it and was annoyed.</p>
    <p>There was a door leading into the parlour from the front kitchen. It was fast closed but the
     Captain, leaving the jam to attend to itself, went and looked at it. While he was standing
     there he heard three words spoken on the other side by the visitor; they were—"your new
     daffodil."</p>
    <p>So that was the business this man had come on! He was trying to buy Julia's ugly streaked
     flower. The Captain's weak mouth set straight; he felt very strongly about
     <pb n="301"/> the daffodil and his daughter's refusal to sell it. He knew she might have done
     so; she had had a good many letters about it since it was exhibited in London. She said little
     about the offers they contained, but he knew she refused them all; he had taxed her with it and
     argued the question to no purpose. Now, to-day, it seemed there was a man so anxious to buy the
     thing that he had actually come to see her; and she, of course, would refuse again. The Captain
     sat down in the easy-chair; he was overcome by the thought of Julia's contrary stupidity.</p>
    <p>The chair was near the door, but he would have scouted the idea that he was listening; he was
     a man of honour, and why should he wish to hear Julia refuse good money? Also it was impossible
     to hear all that was said unless the speakers were close to the door. Apparently they must have
     been near for no sooner had he sat down than he heard the man say, "Haven't I had the pleasure
     of seeing you somewhere before, Miss Snooks? Your face seems familiar though I can't exactly
     locate it."</p>
    <p>"We met at Marbridge," Julia answered; "at a dance, a year and a half ago."</p>
    <p>"At Marbridge? Oh, of course! Funny I shouldn't have remembered when I heard your name the
     other day!"</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington did not think it at all funny; he did not know who Mr. Cross might be,
     nobody important he judged by his voice and manner—hostesses at Marbridge often had to import
     extra nondescript men for their dances. But whoever he was, if he had been there once he might
     go there again and carry with him the tale of Julia's doings and home and other things
     detrimental to the Polkington pride. The Captain listened to hear one of the two in the other
     room refer to the change of name which had prevented an earlier recognition. But
     <pb n="302"/> neither did; she saw no reason for it, and he had forgotten her original name if
     he ever knew it.</p>
    <p>"I remember all about you now," he was saying; "you danced with me several times and asked me
     about the Van Heigens' blue daffodil"—he paused as if a new idea had occurred to him. "You were
     not in the line then, I suppose?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"No, I knew nothing about flower growing or selling," she answered. "What you told me of the
     value of the blue daffodil was a revelation to me."</p>
    <p>He laughed a little. "But one you'll try to profit by," he said.</p>
    <p>The Captain moved in his chair. He could have groaned aloud at the words, which represented
     precisely what Julia would not do. Unfortunately his movement had much the same effect as his
     groan would have done, some one on the other side of the door moved too, and in the opposite
     direction. It must have been Julia, her father was sure of it; it was like her to do it; she
     must have gone almost to the window; he could not make out what was said. The man was no doubt
     trying to buy the bulb; a stray word here and there indicated that, but it was impossible to
     hear what offer was made. It was equally impossible to hear what Julia said; her father only
     caught the inflection of her voice, but he was sure she was refusing.</p>
    <p>In disgust and anger he rose and, having pulled the jam to the side of the fire, went into
     the garden. There he took the hoe and started irritably to work on a bed near the front door;
     it was some relief to his feelings to scratch the ground since he could not scratch anything
     else.</p>
    <p>In a little while Cross came out. "Well, if you won't, you won't," he was saying as Julia
     opened the door. "I
     <pb n="303"/> think you are making a mistake; in fact, if you weren't a lady I should say you
     were acting rather like a fool; but, of course, you must please yourself. If you think better
     of it you can always write to me. Just name the price, a reasonable price, that's all you need
     do. We understand one another, and we can do business without any fuss—you have my
     address?"</p>
    <p>He gave her a card as he spoke, although she assured him she should not want it; then he took
     his leave.</p>
    <p>She watched him go, tearing up the card when he had set off down the road. Captain Polkington
     watched her.</p>
    <p>"What did he want?" he asked, remembering that he was not supposed to know.</p>
    <p>"The bulb," she answered.</p>
    <p>"And you would not sell it?"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>She had come from the doorstep now to pull up some weeds he had overlooked.</p>
    <p>"I can't understand you, Julia," he said resting on his hoe, and speaking as much in sorrow
     as in anger. "You seem to have so little sense of honour—women so seldom have—but I should have
     thought that you would have had a lesson on the necessity, the obligation of paying debts. When
     you come to think of the efforts we are making to pay those debts, how I am straining every
     nerve, giving almost the whole of my income, doing without everything but the barest
     necessaries, without some things that are necessaries in my state of health, what your mother
     is doing, how she has given up her home, her husband, to live almost on charity in her
     son-in-law's house. When you think of all that, I say, and of what your sisters have done, it
     does seem strange that you should grudge this bulb, simply and solely because it was given you
     by some people for whom you care nothing."
     <pb n="304"/></p>
    <p>Julia agreed; she never saw the purpose of contradicting when conviction was out of the
     question. "It does seem strange," she said; "but there is one comfort, the worst of the debts
     will be cleared off by the end of the year. Uncle William knows that and has arranged for it in
     his own mind; I really think it would be almost a pity to disturb the business plans of any one
     so exact."</p>
    <p>"Are we," the Captain returned scornfully, "to pinch and save to the end of the year? Am I to
     do without the few comforts that might make life tolerable? Am I to work like a farm labourer
     and live like one till then, because you choose to keep this bulb?"</p>
    <p>Julia thought it was very probable things would go on as they were for some time, but she did
     not say so; she only said, "I am sorry you find it so trying."</p>
    <p>"Trying!" her father said, and stopped, as if he found the word and most others very
     inadequate. "After all, it does not much matter," he remarked in a tone of gloomy resignation.
     "I shan't be here, in any one's way, much longer; there is not the least chance that I shall
     live till the end of the year, and when I am gone you can do what you please, what you must,
     with your bulb. I own I should like to see you a little more comfortable and better off now. I
     hate to have you doing servant's work and going shabby as you have to. I should like you to be
     decently dressed, taking your proper place in society, but if you think it right to go on as
     you are and to keep your bulb, of course I have nothing to say."</p>
    <p>It was as well he had nothing, for Julia remembered the jam and went indoors, so he would
     have had no one to say it to. She went into the back kitchen, thinking, but not of the jam.
     Once again the temptation to sell the daffodil beset her; not to Cross, he was the last man to
     whom she would have sold it, but to some collector who
     <pb n="305"/> would care for it as the Van Heigens would. She could easily find such a one with
     or without assistance from Cross; little harm would be done to the Van Heigens by it; indeed
     Joost had expected her to do no less, and if she did it she could pay—not the debts her father
     had mentioned—but the one he had not. She had thought this all out before, seen the arguments
     on both sides, and arrived at her conclusion; but there are some things that are not content
     with this treatment once, nor even twice, but demand it a good many more times than that. So
     she thought it out again and came again to the old conclusion. Joost had given her the bulb
     because he loved her; he had made no conditions because he believed in her; he had even
     professed himself content that she should sell it because, in his humbleness and generosity, he
     wanted only that she should get what ease she could. He was content to make what was to him a
     great sacrifice for no other reason than that she should have a little more money on mere
     caprice, the very nature of which he did not know. And so she could not do it, that was the end
     of the whole matter. She could not take the gift of the man who loved her to pay a debt to the
     man she loved.</p>
    <p>She went to fetch jam pots, without calling herself to order for the last admission. It was
     the one luxury she had at that time; daily and nightly she could admit to herself that she
     loved him and he loved her. Not exactly passionately—they were not passionate people, she told
     herself—but in an odd companionable equal sort of way which was the best in the world. Nothing
     would ever come of it, even in the remote future when her father was dead and the debt paid. By
     that time both of them would have grown old and set in their far separate ways, and even if he
     ever heard that she was free he would
     <pb n="306"/> have become wiser and changed his mind. So there was no end to this thing, no
     awakening and disillusioning, none of the disappointment and dreariness which is likely to
     attend the translating of a dream into work-a-day life. For that reason it should have been
     possible to be content, even with the thing which stood between her and realisation—sometimes
     it almost was, at least she persuaded herself so. At others there were things harder to
     control; brief moments when crushing down all opposition and obliterating other thoughts, came
     the memory of how she had crouched behind the chopping-block, how hidden her tears in his coat.
     There was no reason or common-sense in that, no friendship or good-fellowship in the clasp of
     his arms; it was the natural man and the natural woman, and absence could not change it, nor
     time take it away; it had been, it might be again, it obeyed no law and answered to no argument
     in the world. It was something which made her ashamed and afraid and yet glad with a rare
     incommunical gladness that was pointed with pain.</p>
    <p>Just then the jam boiled over, and she had to leave her pots to run and save it.</p>
    <p>It is a great thing to have your mind under fair control; the Polkington training, wherein
     the advisable and advantageous were compelled to rank high even in matter of emotion, is not
     without use in bringing this about. But it is also a great thing, almost, perhaps, a more
     important one for some people, to have plenty to do even if it is only making jam.</p>
    <p>While Julia made her jam Captain Polkington hoed; at least he did for a little while, then he
     gradually ceased and stood leaning upon his hoe, lost in unhappy thought. At last he moved,
     and, gathering the withering weeds that lay beside the path, carried them to an old basket
     <pb n="307"/> which he had left beside the garden wall. With the weeds he picked up the torn
     fragments of card which Julia had dropped beside the doorstep; he let them fall into the basket
     with the other rubbish, but when he saw them gleaming white among the green they arrested his
     attention. For a moment he looked at them, then he carefully picked them out; he had some
     thought of appealing to Julia once more, or telling her that he had saved the man's address for
     her and she had one last chance. He sat down on the wall; would it be any good to appeal? he
     asked himself despondently. Would anything be any good? Was not everything a failure? No one
     regarded him; Cross, the man whose card he held, had not even glanced in his direction when he
     went down the path. A miserable bargain-driving tradesman had passed him and paid no more
     attention to him than if he had been a gardener! Gillat, his own friend, did not regard him,
     thought nothing of his comforts; he was all for Julia; thought of nothing and no one else. As
     for Julia herself, she had not the slightest regard for him, no consideration, not even filial
     respect and obedience.</p>
    <p>He looked gloomily before him for a little, then his eye fell on the white fragments he held,
     the address of the man who was anxious to buy the daffodil which Julia in her obstinate folly
     and selfish unreasonableness, would not sell. If it only were sold! He thought over all the
     good things that could then be done; they were the same as those excellent reasons that he had
     himself given a little while back. Some people might have said they were rather diverse and not
     all mutually inclusive, but no such idea troubled him; he was sure all could easily have been
     done if the daffodil were sold. He felt that he could have done it all quite well, he did not
     stop to think how—if he had had the handling of the money he could have been a
     <pb n="308"/> benefactor to his whole family, especially Julia. It was hard that he should be
     prevented, bitterly hard; it had so often happened in his life that he had been prevented from
     doing what was good and useful by want of means and opportunity or the stupid obstinacy of
     other people. He grew more and more depressed as he sat on the wall thinking of these things
     and wondering if there were many men so useless, so unfortunate and misunderstood as he.</p>
    <p>This depression lasted all that day and on into the next; indeed, for some time longer. It
     lifted a little once in the course of a week, but not much, and soon settled down again, making
     the Captain very miserable, disinclined for work, and decidedly bad company. Johnny thought he
     was not well, but Julia fancied his trouble had something to do with annoyance and the
     daffodil. He did not confide in either of them, maintaining a proud and gloomy silence and
     nursing his grievance so that it grew. For days he cherished his sense of injury and wrong,
     until it became large and took a good hold upon him. Then, all at once, for no reason that one
     can give, a change came, and his mind, as if smitten by a gust of wind, began to veer about, to
     stir and lighten. Why, he suddenly asked himself, was it that Julia would not sell the bulb?
     Because—the answer was so absurdly simple he wondered it had not occurred to him before—because
     it was the Van Heigens' present, and one cannot sell presents. He perfectly understood the
     scruple, honoured it even; but he also saw quite plainly that, though it prevented her from
     selling the daffodil, it did not stand in the way of its being sold. She could not, of course,
     authorise the sale, any more than she could conduct it; but that was no reason why she should
     not be very pleased to have it sold. Indeed, not only was this a probability,
     <pb n="309"/> practically a certainty, but more than likely she had had some such idea in her
     mind when she spoke of the matter to her father—in all likelihood she was wondering now why he
     had not taken the hint.</p>
    <p>Thus Captain Polkington reasoned, seeing light at last in the dimness of the depression which
     had possessed him. Quite how much he really believed, or even if he were capable of real
     reasonable belief at this stage of his career, it is not easy to say. It is possible he may
     have thought he was right for the time being; his conscience was capable of remarkable
     gymnastic feats at times. It is also possible that he, like some others of the human race, was
     not really able to think at all. Anyhow the depression that weighed upon him lifted, and he
     remembered with satisfaction that he had kept the torn fragments of Cross' card.</p>
    <p>In the early part of the summer the hyacinths, tulips, and finer narcissus had been taken out
     of the ground and put to dry. Julia hoped by this means to get more and better flowers from
     them next year than is the case when they are left in the earth. They took some time to dry and
     were not really ready till the summer was far advanced; but that did not matter to her, however
     it may have inconvenienced her father; she was too busy to attend to them earlier. By the
     middle of August they were ready, and she set to cleaning them in her spare time with Johnny to
     help her. He was proud and pleased to do so, and did not in the least mind the extreme
     irritation of the skin which befalls those who rub off the old loose husks. A place was
     prepared for the bulbs in one of the sheds, the wide shelf cleared and partitions made in it by
     Mr. Gillat, who also spent some time in writing labels for each of the divisions. Julia told
     him this was unnecessary as she knew by the shape which were hya
     <pb n="310"/>cinths and which tulips; still he did it. Captain Polkington did not offer any
     assistance; he merely looked on with indifferent interest; the matter did not seem to concern
     him.</p>
    <p>But one day, towards the end of the month, but before the bulbs were all done, Julia went
     into the town.</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington saw her start; then he wandered to the shed where Johnny was at work. For
     a little he stood watching, then he walked leisurely round the place looking at this and
     that.</p>
    <p>"You will never be able to tell which is which of these things," he remarked at last.</p>
    <p>Johnny looked at his somewhat conspicuous labels. "I've named them, don't you see
     'Tulips?'"</p>
    <p>"But you don't say what sort of tulips, which are red and which yellow. Nor what sort of
     narcissus, which are daffodils and which the bunchy things."</p>
    <p>"No," Mr. Gillat admitted; "no, they got mixed in the digging up; I forgot, and put them all
     in the barrow together; that's how it happened."</p>
    <p>"What? The whole lot?" the Captain inquired. "The streaked daffodil and all? What did Julia
     say?"</p>
    <p>"She said it did not matter," Johnny told him; "they'll be all the more surprise to us when
     they come up next year."</p>
    <p>"She didn't mind, not even about the streaked daffodil?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, that was not there," Mr. Gillat said, serenely unconscious that the fate of that bulb
     was the only interest. "We have got that by itself."</p>
    <p>He showed a little piece of shelf penned off from the rest and carefully covered with wire
     netting for fear of rats. Three different shaped bulbs were there in a row.</p>
    <p>"That's it," Johnny said, pointing to one of the three.
     <pb n="311"/> "And that end one is the red tulip with the black middle; it is supposed to be
     very good; and that other is the double blue hyacinth from down by the gate; we are going to
     try it in a pot in the house next year and have it bloom early."</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington nodded, but did not show much interest. "Did you put these here, or did
     she?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"She did," Johnny answered. "She cleans them much better than I do, and we knew they were
     choice ones, the best one of each kind, so she cleaned them; but I made the wire cover."</p>
    <p>The Captain did not praise the ingenuity of this contrivance, which he did not admire at all,
     and soon afterwards he sauntered back to the house. He was dozing in the easy-chair in the
     front kitchen when Johnny came in to change his coat before setting out to meet Julia. He did
     not seem to have moved much when Mr. Gillat came down-stairs ready to start.</p>
    <p>"What?" he roused himself to say when Johnny announced his destination. "Oh, all right, you
     need not have waked me to tell me that, it really is of no importance to me if you like to walk
     in the blazing sun." He settled himself afresh in the chair, muttering something about the
     heat, and Johnny went out, quietly closing the door after him.</p>
    <p>It was an hour later when Julia and the faithful Johnny came back, the latter decidedly hot
     although he was carrying one of the lightest of the parcels. Captain Polkington was still in
     his chair; he woke up as they entered.</p>
    <p>"Why," he said, "I must have dropped asleep!" He rose and went to take Julia's parcels. "Let
     me put these away for you," he said solicitiously; "it is a great deal too hot for you to be
     walking in the sun and carrying all these things."
     <pb n="312"/></p>
    <p>"Thank you," Julia answered; "that's all right. Perhaps you would not mind getting the tea,
     though; if you would do that I should be glad."</p>
    <p>He did mind, but he set about it, and it was perhaps well for him that he did, as otherwise
     he might have paid a suspicious number of fidgety attentions to Julia. As it was, doing the
     menial work which he always considered beneath his dignity, while Johnny sat still and rested,
     restored him to his usual manner.</p>
    <p>But the Captain, though he was safely past the initial difficulty, did not find the working
     out of his scheme altogether easy. He had the bulb, it is true, and he was safe from detection
     for there was still under the wire cover a smooth yellow-brown narcissus root very like the
     first one; but he had got to get rid of it. It was not very easy to get a letter to the post
     here without remark from Mr. Gillat. That, in the circumstances, would be undesirable for it
     was likely to arouse Julia's suspicions, and if they were roused she might think it her duty to
     interfere—even though, of course, she did wish the bulb sold. Her father recognised that and,
     determining not to give her the opportunity, got his letter written betimes and waited for a
     chance to give it to the postman unobserved. In writing he had been faced by one very great
     difficulty, he had not the least idea how much to ask. Cross had said "name a reasonable
     price," and he must name one, or else it would appear that he were writing on his own behalf
     not Julia's; but he did not know what was reasonable and he had no chance of finding out. A new
     orchid, he had vaguely heard, was sometimes worth a hundred pounds; but it was impossible any
     one should pay so much for a daffodil, an ordinary garden flower. Julia, whatever her motive,
     would not have refused to sell it if it would have fetched so much; he could not con
     <pb n="313"/>ceive of a Polkington, especially a poor one, turning her back on a hundred
     pounds. For hours he thought about this and at last decided to ask twenty pounds. It seemed
     more to him now than it would have done a year ago, by reason of the small sums he had handled
     lately; but it was a good deal less than his golden dreams had painted the bulb to be worth in
     the time when it seemed unattainable, and he was paying debts and providing for Julia out of
     the proceeds of the imaginary sale. Still, he finally decided to ask it and wrote to that
     effect, and after some waiting for the opportunity got the letter posted.</p>
    <p>After that there followed an unpleasant time or suspense, made the more unpleasant by the
     fact that he had to look out for the postman as he did not want the return letter to fall into
     Julia's hands. At last, after a longer time than he expected, the reply came safely to hand.
     This was it—</p>
    <quote>
     <p>"<hi>Sir</hi>,</p>
     <p>"I am obliged to decline your offer of the streaked daffodil bulb, the price you name being
      absurd. To tell the plain truth, I would rather not do business with you in the matter; I
      prefer to deal with principals, else in these cases there is little guarantee of good
      faith.</p>
    </quote>
    <p>"Yours faithfully,</p>
    <p>"<hi>Alexander Cross.</hi>"</p>
    <quote>
     <p>"P. S.—If you should fail to dispose of your bulb elsewhere and it would be a convenience to
      you, I will give you a five pound note for it, that is, if you can guarantee it genuine. It is
      not, under the circumstances, worth more to me.</p>
    </quote>
    <p>"A. C."</p>
    <p>So the Captain read and then re-read; anger, mortification and disappointment preventing him
     from grasping
     <pb n="314"/> the full meaning at first. Five pounds, only five pounds! No wonder Julia would
     not sell her bulb; no wonder she preferred to keep a present that would only fetch five pounds!
     What was such a trifle? The Captain glared at the letter as he asked himself the question
     proudly. His pride was badly wounded. Cross had not set him right in his mistaken idea of the
     daffodil's value too politely; at least he thought not. Why should he, this tradesman, say he
     preferred to deal with principals? Did he imagine that a gentleman would attempt to sell him a
     spurious bulb? The Captain's honour was not of that sort and he felt outraged. He felt
     outraged, too, almost insulted, at being told that the price was absurd. The absurd thing was
     that he should be expected to know anything about trade or trade prices. "The man can have no
     idea of my position," he thought.</p>
    <p>But there he was not quite correct; it was precisely because he had a suspicion of the
     position that Cross had written thus. No one with any right to it would offer the true bulb for
     twenty pounds; either, so he argued, it was stolen or not genuine; which, he did not know, the
     odds were about even. After making a few inquiries at Marbridge into Captain Polkington's
     history he came to the conclusion that the chance in favour of the true bulb was worth five
     pounds to him. Accordingly he offered it, indifferent as to the result, but rather anticipating
     its acceptance.</p>
    <p>It was accepted. The Captain was mortified and disappointed, but five pounds is five pounds.
     It even seems a good deal more when your income is very small and the part of it which you
     handle yourself so much smaller as to amount to nothing worth mentioning. It was September now,
     and already the mornings and evenings were cold, foretaste of the winter which was coming, which
     <pb n="315"/> would hold the exposed land in its grip for months. Five pounds would buy things
     which would make the winter more tolerable; small comforts and luxuries meant a great deal to
     real poverty in cold weather and feeble health. Of course to Johnny and Julia too; they were
     all going to benefit. Captain Polkington packed the bulb in a small box and posted it when he
     went to Halgrave to have his hair cut.</p>
    <p>By return he received a five pound note—a convenient handy form of money, easy to send, easy
     to change. Halgrave might not perhaps be able to give change for it without inconvenience, but
     Julia could get it changed next time she went into town. That would not be just yet, but a note
     will keep; it would perhaps be better to keep it for the present. The Captain folded it in his
     pocket-book and kept it.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
    <head>THE BENEFACTOR</head>
    <p>It was not till October that Captain Polkington was able to change the five pound note. This
     was really Julia's fault, she went so seldom into the town; he had once or twice suggested her
     doing so when she said they wanted this or that, but she never took the hint, and the note was
     still in his pocket-book. At last, however, the opportunity came.</p>
    <p>A keeper's wife with whom Julia had got acquainted had promised her a pair of lop-eared
     rabbits if she could come and fetch them. She was not very anxious to have them, but Mr. Gillat
     was; he said they would be very profitable. Julia doubted this; but, since he wanted them, she
     said they would have them, and accordingly, one morning, they started together with a basket
     for the rabbits. They started directly after breakfast for they had to go a long way across the
     heath and could not at the best be back before two o'clock. Captain Polkington watched them go,
     standing at the cottage door until their figures were small on the great expanse of heather.
     Then he went in and, sitting down, wrote a hasty note to Julia; it was to the effect that he
     had been obliged to go into town, but would be back by dark or soon after. It read as quite a
     casual communication, as if he were in the habit of going into town frequently and had much
     business to transact. The Captain was rather satisfied with
     <pb n="317"/> it; he felt he was doing the straightforward thing in telling Julia, his whole
     proceedings were open and above board. When he came back he should tell her all about the
     money, how it had been raised and how spent. She should have had the spending of it herself if
     only she had gone to town when he suggested it; as it was, he must do it; it was absurd to wait
     any longer; the weather was already cold; he must go, and bring her some pleasant surprise when
     he came back.</p>
    <p>Satisfied with these reflections and feeling already the glow of beneficence, he dressed
     himself and set out for Halgrave. He had to walk to the village and there take the carrier's
     cart which went into town twice a week; he reflected, while he waited for the vehicle, how
     fortunate it was that Julia and Johnny had chosen to go for the rabbits to-day, one of the days
     when the carrier went to town. There were a good many bundles going by the cart, and two other
     passengers who were inclined to be too familiar until somewhat haughtily shown their proper
     place. The Captain was a little annoyed by this; and annoyed, also, to find that the carrier
     was not in the habit of starting on the return journey till rather late, later than the note
     would lead Julia to expect her father. But as the carrier was not one to change his habits for
     anybody, that could not be helped and Captain Polkington made the best of it. Julia was not
     likely to be anxious about him, he was sure; and since he was going to tell her all about his
     doings, it might as well be late as early. By this time he had quite got rid of any qualms—if
     he ever had them—about the method of getting and the intention of spending the note. He had
     almost forgotten that it had not always been his, and was quite sure that he was doing the
     right thing—for others as well as himself—in the difficult circumstances which seemed to beset
     him more than the
     <pb n="318"/> common run of men. Cheered by these thoughts he endured the discomforts of the
     journey with moderate patience; he almost felt that he was suffering them in a good cause, for
     the sake of Johnny and Julia.</p>
    <p>The town was large and the centre of a large district, not at all like the retired gentility
     of Marbridge, very much bigger and busier. Captain Polkington, who had lived quietly so long,
     felt rather lost and bewildered at first in the bustling intricate streets; there were so many
     people, especially among the shops, they were always getting in his way. He only made one
     purchase before lunch; he would have plenty of time in the afternoon, he thought, and would be
     better able to decide what to buy when he had seen things and had a meal. The purchase made
     before lunch was at the wine merchants, it was whisky.</p>
    <p>He lunched at the best hotel; that and the whisky made a rather bigger hole in the five pound
     note than one would have expected. Still, as he told himself the whisky really was a vital
     matter with winter coming on, a necessity, not a luxury, for all of them—Johnny would be better
     for a little—he used to like a glass in the old days; and Julia would certainly be the better
     for it, working as she did in the cold. It was a medicine for them all, not himself alone. The
     lunch was the only personal extravagance and really, seeing what he was doing for the others,
     there was no need for him to grudge that to himself.</p>
    <p>So he lunched and then the trouble began. He was not clear quite how it happened; at least,
     owing to the confusion there always was in his mind between facts as they were, as he wished
     them to be, and as they appeared in retrospect—he was never able to explain it thoroughly.
     There were other men lunching at the same time; he still had the Polkington faculty for making
     friends and ac
     <pb n="319"/>quaintances; he still, too, had the appearance and manner of a gentleman, if of
     somewhat reduced circumstances. He apparently made acquaintances; exactly how many and what
     sort is not certain, the account was very confused here. There was a whisky and soda in it, two
     whiskies and sodas, or even three; a cigar, a game of billiards—perhaps there was more than one
     game, or some other game besides billiards. At all events there must have been something more,
     for the Captain afterwards declared he was ruined in less than an hour, fleeced, cheated of his
     little all! It is quite possible that he was nothing of the kind, and that the acquaintances
     were perfectly honest and honourable men. They would not know he could not afford to lose, a
     true Polkington always set out to hide the reality of his poverty. And he was not likely to
     win, he seldom did, no matter at what he played or with whom; he was constitutionally
     unlucky—or incapable, which is a truer name for the same thing—it had always been so, even as
     far back as the old times in India. That day he lost at something, that at least was clear;
     then there was more whisky and soda and more losses, and perhaps more whisky again; and so on
     until late in the afternoon, he found himself standing, miserable and bewildered, in the main
     street of the town. Some one had brought him there, a good-natured young fellow who thought,
     not that he had spent all he ought, but that he had drunk all he should.</p>
    <p>"Not used to it, you know," he had said with good-humoured apology; "been rusticating out of
     the way so long. Better come out and get a breath of air, it'll pull you together."</p>
    <p>And he persuaded him out, walked some way down the street with him and then, seeing that he
     seemed all right, left him and went to attend to his own business.
     <pb n="320"/></p>
    <p>For a little the Captain stood where he was, the depression, begotten of whisky and his
     losses, growing upon him in the old overwhelming way. No one took any notice of him; passers by
     jostled against him, for the pavement was rather narrow, but no one paid any attention to him.
     The bustle bewildered his weak head, and the noise and movement of the traffic in the roadway
     irritated him unreasonably. A youth ran into him and he exploded angrily with sudden weak
     unrestrained fury. Thereat the boy laughed, and, when he shouted and stamped his foot, ran away
     saying something impudent. The Captain turned to run after him shaking his stick; but he was
     stiff and rheumatic and weak on his legs, too, just now. It was no use to try and run. Of
     course it was no use, nothing was any use now, he was a miserable failure, he could not even
     run after a boy; he must bear every one's taunts; he could almost have wept in self-pity. Then
     he became aware that several passers by were looking at him curiously, arrested by the noise he
     had made. Annoyed and ashamed he turned his back on them and pretended to be examining the
     goods in a shop window near.</p>
    <p>It was a large draper's, rather a cheap one; the better shops were higher up the street. In
     this one the things were all priced and labelled plainly; the Captain at first did not notice
     this one way or the other; he simply looked in to cover his confusion. But after a little he
     became aware of what he looked at, and it recalled to his mind the fact that he was going to
     buy something for Julia. He did not quite know what, he had had large ideas at one time; they
     had had to be diminished once because five pounds will not do as much as twenty; they had to be
     diminished again because he had been fleeced of so much of the five pounds. A wave of anger
     shook him as he
     <pb n="321"/> thought of that, but he suppressed it; he felt that he must not give way, so he
     looked steadily at the window. There were furs displayed there, muffs and collarettes of skunk
     and other animals, even the humble rabbit artistically treated to meet the insatiable female
     appetite for sable at all prices. The Captain decided on the best collarette displayed and
     turned towards the shop door feeling a little better in the glow of benevolence that returned
     to him as he thought of how much he was going to spend for Julia. Just as he was going in he
     caught sight of a girl selling violets in the street. She was a good-looking impudent girl, and
     catching his eye she pressed her wares on him glibly; he hesitated, smiled—here was one who
     treated him as a man, who considered it worth while. He looked defiantly at the passers by—he
     was a man, not an object for curiosity or kindly contempt. He returned the girl's glance with
     an ogle and, stepping as jauntily as he could to the edge of the pavement, took a bunch of
     flowers with some suitable pleasantry. Half-way through his remark he stopped dead; he had felt
     in his pocket for a penny and found nothing. Quickly, feverishly, almost desperately, he felt
     in the other pocket; there were three coins there; by the size he could tell that one at least
     was a penny; he took it out and gave it to the girl; he had not the courage to put down the
     flowers and go without them. Then he turned away. A narrow passage ran down between the
     draper's and the next house; fewer people went that way and in the window there, common and
     less expensive goods were displayed. The Captain went down the foot-way and examined the two
     remaining coins. They were a shilling and a penny.</p>
    <p>People passed and repassed along the main road; carts and carriages rumbled over the uneven
     stones; no one heeded the shabby hopeless figure by the side window.
     <pb n="322"/> They were lighting up in the draper's though outside there was still daylight;
     the gas jets were considered to make the place look more attractive. They shone warmly on the
     furs and silk scarves in the front window, making them look rich and luxurious. Two girls
     stopped to look in; then, their means being more suitable to the goods there, they came to
     examine the side window. They were two servants out for the afternoon; they wore winter coats
     open over summer dresses and hats that might be called autumnal, seeing that they were an
     ingenious blending of the best that was left from the headgear of both seasons.</p>
    <p>"I shall get one of them woolly neck things, I shall," one said; "they're quite as nice as
     fur and not so dear."</p>
    <p>The other could not agree. "Don't care about them myself," she said; "I must say I like a bit
     of sable."</p>
    <p>"Can't get it under two and eleven," her companion rejoined; "and those things are only a
     shilling three. Look at that pink one there; it looks quite as good as feathers any day. I'm
     not so gone on sable myself; you can't have it pink, and pink's my colour."</p>
    <p>They moved on to another window; they, no more than the passers by, noticed the old man who
     stood just at their elbow. When they had gone he looked drearily in where they had looked.
     There were the woolly things they had spoken of, short woven strips of loopy wool, to be tied
     about the neck by the two-inch ribbons that dangled from the ends. "Ostrich wool boas in all
     colours, price, one shilling and three farthings," they were ticketed. He read the ticket
     mechanically. He still held his two coins; he held them mechanically; had he thought about it
     he would scarcely have troubled to do so, they were so cruelly, so mockingly inadequate. He
     read the ticket again; it obtruded itself upon him as trivial things do at
     <pb n="323"/> unexpected times. But now its meaning began to be impressed upon his brain—"one
     shilling and three farthings"—that, then, was the interpretation of the servant girl's
     "shilling three." He had a shilling and a penny—a shilling and three farthings. He could buy
     one of those ostrich wool boas—he would buy it—that pink one for Julia.</p>
    <p>The Halgrave carrier made it a rule to receive his passengers' fares at the beginning of the
     expedition; if they were coming back as well as going with him they paid for the double journey
     at the outset in the morning. Captain Polkington had so paid, and it was that fact, coupled
     with the early arrival at the stables of his one purchase, which induced the carrier to wait
     nearly half-an-hour for him. The cart was packed, everything was ready, and the good man and
     the only other passenger he was taking back were growing impatient, when the Captain, carrying
     a small crushed paper parcel, appeared. He had lost his way to the stables and had wandered
     hopelessly in his efforts to find it. The carrier was rather short-tempered about it, and the
     other passenger said something to the effect that "They didn't oughter let him out alone!" The
     Captain payed no attention but climbed into the back of the cart and sat down near his whisky.
     The other passenger got up beside the driver, and in a few minutes they were lumbering down the
     crooked streets. Soon they were out of the town and jogging quietly along the quiet lanes; the
     driver leaned forward to get a light from his passenger's pipe; his face for a moment showed
     ruddy in the glow of the one lamp, then it sunk into gloom again. Captain Polkington did not
     notice; he did not notice the voices in intermittent talk, or the fume of their tobacco that
     hung on the moist air and mingled
     <pb n="324"/> with the scent of the drooping violets in his coat. He knew nothing and was aware
     of nothing except that he was the most miserable, the most unfortunate of men. Throughout the
     whole interminable journey he dwelt on that one thing as he sat by his whisky in the dark,
     clutching tightly the soft paper parcel and finding his only fragment of comfort in it. He had
     after all bought something; poor, disappointed, fleeced as he was, he had spent his last money
     in buying a present for his daughter.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
    <head>THE GOING OF THE GOOD COMRADE</head>
    <p>The cottage was very quiet. Although it was not late, both Captain Polkington and Johnny had
     gone to bed, the one to suit himself, the other to oblige Julia; she was in the kitchen now, as
     completely alone as she could wish. And certainly she did wish it; by the hard light in her
     eyes and the grim look about her mouth it was clear she was in no mood for company. She had got
     at the truth that evening, or most of it; the whole affair, with the exception of one point
     only, was quite plain to her; not by her father's wish or intention, but plain none the less.
     Subterfuge was an art the Polkingtons understood so well that it was exceedingly difficult to
     deceive them; Julia was the most difficult of them all to deceive, and the Captain was least
     clever at subterfuge; it was not wonderful, therefore, that she knew nearly all there was to
     know. Her heart was bitter within her, but against herself as well as against her father—after
     all he had but done what she had once thought to do. She had stayed her hand because the one
     who owned the daffodil was a child to her. Her father had had no such reason for staying his;
     the one who owned this daffodil was as cunning as he. He had done what he had, badly of course
     he could not do otherwise—a foredained failure such as he—bungled it hopelessly; but the idea
     was the same—a bad travesty of a bad idea, badly worked out. For a
     <pb n="326"/> moment her mind glanced aside from the main issue in disgust and contempt for the
     method. It was sin without genius, a puerile theft without adequate return, a miserable fall,
     and for such a purpose! To expect to find the streaked daffodil unguarded in an outhouse! To
     sell it for five pounds and think to spend the money on creature comforts! It is hard to say
     which of the three was the worst. The really good have little idea how such fool's knavery
     looks to the shadily clever; it brings home to them the wrongness of wrong, disgusting them
     with it and with themselves, as no preaching in the world can.</p>
    <p>The moon had risen by this time; its first beams shone in at the unshuttered window. Julia
     went to the door and, opening it, looked out. There was a little mist about and the moon, quite
     a young one, was struggling through it, shining with a soft, diffused light that made the
     landscape very unearthly.</p>
    <p>It was wonderfully still out of doors, quiet and damp with belts of unexplained shadow here
     and there, and a sense of illimitable space and silence. Julia sat down on the door steps and
     smelt the good smell of the earth and felt the nearness of it. But it did not comfort her; she
     was not in tune with the night; she had neither part nor lot with these things. "Thief, and
     daughter of a thief;" the words kept coming to her—and he, the man whom she never named to
     herself, had called her his good comrade! She bowed her face to her knees and sat
     motionless.</p>
    <p>She had told him the truth about herself; she had not been ashamed; she would not have been
     even if she had taken the daffodil. But her father! She was ashamed for him with a bitter
     shame; ashamed of herself and him too, in thought and intention at least they were one,
     <pb n="327"/>double-dealers. "Two grubby little people," as she had seen them long ago when
     they first stood in company with that man.</p>
    <p>"But you don't know; you have not our temptations." She almost spoke aloud, unconsciously
     addressing the dewy silence as her mind called the man plainly before her. "You have never
     wanted money as I wanted it, or wanted things as father wanted them. Oh, you would despise the
     things he wanted—so do I; they are miserable and mean and sordid; you couldn't want whisky and
     comfort as he wanted them, but you can't think how he did! He would have justified it to
     himself too; you wouldn't, couldn't do that, while we—we could justify the devil if we tried.
     It is not right, any the more for that, I know it is not; it is dishonest and disgraceful, I
     know that as well as you; but I know how it came about and you—you can never understand!" Her
     voice sank away. That was the great difference between herself and this man; it did not lie in
     what she did; that was a remedial matter—but rather in what she knew and felt. Things that did
     not exist for him were not only possible but sometimes almost necessary to her and hers. The
     gulf between them which had almost seemed bridged in the early summer was suddenly opened again
     by the day's work; opened beyond all passage for her—thief, and daughter of a thief.</p>
    <p>She sat on the doorstone looking out with unseeing eyes while the moon rose higher and the
     light grew so that the belts of shadow melted and the misty land was all silver, a world of
     dreams, very pure and still. But neither her dreams nor her thoughts were pure and still; they
     were full of passion and pain, longing and regret and shame, and yet an underlying hopeless
     desire that all could be known and understood.</p>
    <p>
     <pb n="328"/></p>
    <p>At last she rose and went in. The pink woolly thing Captain Polkington had bought her lay on
     the kitchen-table, half out of its paper wrappings, a silly, useless thing. As her eyes fell on
     it they grew dim and hot while the colour crept up in her cheek. Her father had bought it for
     her; he had thought to please her with the foolish thing; it was like a child's or a fool's
     gift; she hated herself for hating it. But he had deceived himself into thinking he was
     generous to make it with his illgotten gains; he had salved conscience with it—it was a liar's
     gift, a self-deceiver's, a thief's. There was no kindness, no generosity in it, and she
     despised him—and he was her father!</p>
    <p>She picked up the thing, paper and all, and crammed it into the dying fire. Then suddenly she
     burst into tears. The world was all wrong, justice was wrong and suffering was wrong and
     mankind wrong, all was wrong and inexplicable and pitiful too.</p>
    <p>For a minute she sobbed chokingly, then she forced back the tears with the angry impatience
     of a hurt animal, and fetching a sheet of paper and pencil, sat down to write. He was her
     father and he was a man with a warped idea of honour, one whose self-respect had been taken
     away; it was too late to teach him, one could only safeguard him now. Opportunity did not make
     thieves of such as her, but it did of such as him, and she had left the opportunity—or what he
     took to be it—open. She would close it now for ever; she would be rid of the bulb, the cause of
     so much trouble. So she wrote hurriedly, a mere scrawl, while the passion was still upon her,
     and her eyes were still dim with tears—</p>
    <p>"Joost, if you have ever cared for me, take back the daffodil; take it back and don't ask me
     why."</p>
    <p>The next morning Julia posted a small parcel, and
     <pb n="329"/> at dinner time told Johnny and her father that she had sent the famous daffodil
     back to its native land.</p>
    <p>Johnny looked up in mild surprise; he had been to the outhouse that morning to see if the
     bulbs were keeping dry. "Why," he said, "it's in the shed!"</p>
    <p>"No, it is not," Julia answered, "and it never was. The one you think it is one of the large
     double pale ones; I told you at the time we put them away, but you have got mixed, I
     expect."</p>
    <p>"Ah, yes, of course," Mr. Gillat said; "I remember now; of course, I remember."</p>
    <p>The Captain swallowed something, but contrived to keep quiet, and only darted a glance at
     Johnny, the muddler, whose information could never be depended on.</p>
    <p>When the meal was over and Mr. Gillat in the back kitchen, Captain Polkington spoke to his
     daughter.</p>
    <p>"Julia," he said, moistening his dry lips, "that man Cross thought it was the streaked
     daffodil that I, that—"</p>
    <p>His voice tailed away, but Julia only said, "Well?"</p>
    <p>"I pledged by word of honour that it was the true one."</p>
    <p>Again Julia said, "Well?"</p>
    <p>"What is to be done?" the Captain asked.</p>
    <p>She showed no signs of grasping his meaning or at all events of helping him out. He burst out
     irritably, "What on earth have you sold it for? Nothing would induce you to do so before when I
     asked you to; now, all at once you have taken a freak and parted with it without any
     consideration whatever. I never saw anything like women, so utterly irrational!"</p>
    <p>"I have not sold it," Julia told him; "only sent it away."
     <pb n="330"/></p>
    <p>"What for? It is perfectly absurd! I suppose you can get it back? You must get it back."</p>
    <p>Julia asked "What for?" in her turn.</p>
    <p>The Captain enlightened her. "There is Cross," he said; "I told him that was the daffodil,
     and it is not. Something must be done; we can't cheat him; we must send him the daffodil, or
     else refund the five pounds. We should have to do that—and we can't."</p>
    <p>"No," Julia agreed grimly; "and we would not if we could."</p>
    <p>"But what are you going to do?" her father asked.</p>
    <p>"Nothing."</p>
    <p>"Nothing! But I pledged my word! You don't understand, I am in honour bound."</p>
    <p>Julia forbore to make and comment on her father's notion of honour; indeed, it struck her as
     almost pathetic in its grotesqueness and certainly very characteristic of the Polkingtons.</p>
    <p>"Cross paid five pounds for the streaked daffodil," the Captain went on to say, believing
     that he was stating the case with incontrovertible plainness, "and if he does not have the true
     bulb he must have the money back; otherwise he will, with justice, say he has been cheated, for
     I guaranteed the thing."</p>
    <p>"He paid five pounds for a speculation," Julia said; "your guarantee was nothing, and though
     he may have asked for it, it was just a form and did not count one way or the other. He knew
     there was a chance that you had come by the true bulb somehow and so had it to sell; he risked
     five pounds on that—and lost it."</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington looked bewildered. "He paid five pounds for the bulb," he persisted; "he
     said it was worth no more to him."</p>
    <p>"Very likely not, if he could get it for that," Julia
     <pb n="331"/> said; "but if he could have been sure of it, it would have been worth two hundred
     pounds."</p>
    <p>"Two hundred!" Captain Polkington gasped, turning rather white.</p>
    <p>Julia nodded. "With my guarantee," she said. "You had not got that; I suppose you let him see
     it when you wrote first so he knew that, though you might have the real bulb, you were not in a
     position to sell it well."</p>
    <p>The Captain flushed as suddenly as he had paled. "You think he thought I had not come by it
     honestly, that I had no right in my daughter's affairs?"</p>
    <p>"I don't see it matters what he thought," Julia answered, taking up the dishes. "He risked
     his money, and lost it, knowing very well what he did; he does not mind doing business in that
     way; I don't admire it myself, but I guessed he would do it when I first made his
     acquaintance."</p>
    <p>"You ——" the Captain said.</p>
    <p>"I have nothing to do with it, and shall have nothing."</p>
    <p>"But the money must be paid; it is a debt of honour; I must clear myself."</p>
    <p>Julia shrugged her shoulders.</p>
    <p>"You do not wish me cleared?" her father demanded haughtily.</p>
    <p>"Paying the five pounds would not clear you," she said; "neither that nor anything else. No,
     I am not going to pay it; I don't feel any obligation in the matter. If Mr. Cross goes in for
     those sort of dealings he must put up with the consequence, and I am afraid you must, too." And
     with that she went away.</p>
    <p>This was the last reference that was made to the sale of the daffodil and the expedition to
     town; after that the matter was left out of conversation and Julia behaved as if it had never
     existed. But Captain Polkington was
     <pb n="332"/> very unhappy; he could not get over the affair and his own failure; he brooded
     over it in silence, feeling and resenting that he could not speak to either Johnny or Julia,
     they being quite unable to understand his emotions. Once or twice he raged weakly against
     Cross, who had given him five pounds when he had asked twenty for a thing worth two hundred;
     who had doubted his word, who had behaved as if he were a common thief—who would, doubtless,
     think him one. More often his indignation burnt up against Julia who would do nothing to remedy
     this last catastrophe, and clear him and reinstate his honour in the eyes of this man and
     himself. Most often of all his quarrel was with fate, and then his anger broke down into
     self-pity as he thought of all the troubles that were crowding about his later years; of his
     lost reputation, his lack of sympathy and comprehension; the failure of all his plans and
     hopes, the poverty and feeble health that oppressed him. In these gloomy days he had one ray of
     comfort only; it lay in the purchase he had made on that day that he went shopping. That whisky
     was the solitary thing in the day's adventure about which Julia had not heard; everything else
     she had been told, but somehow that had escaped. One reason of this, no doubt, lay in the fact
     that Captain Polkington had not brought his purchase home with him that evening. He had meant
     to; when the carrier set him and his property down just outside Halgrave, he had fully meant to
     carry it to the cottage. But he found it so heavy and cumbersome in his weak and dejected state
     that he had to give it up. So he found a suitable hiding-place in the deep overgrown ditch
     beside the road, and, thrusting it as much out of sight as he could, left it there and went
     home unburdened. He meant to tell Julia and Johnny about it, they of course were to have
     shared, and one or
     <pb n="333"/> both of them would go with him to fetch it home in the morning. But he did not
     tell them; it did not seem suitable at first; they, each in a different way, were too
     unsympathetic about the expedition to town; he determined to wait for a fitting opportunity.
     The opportunity did not come; but in course of time the whisky was moved and gave comfort of
     sorts during the autumn days to the Captain's drooping spirits, if it had a less beneficial
     effect on his failing health.</p>
    <p>In the meantime the daffodil, "The Good Comrade," had gone back to its native land, and with
     it an appeal, written in English, badly written, scrawled almost—but not likely to be refused.
     Joost read it through once, twice, more times than that; it said little, only, take back the
     bulb and ask no questions, yet he felt he had been honoured by Julia's confidence. The very
     style and haste of the letter seemed an honour to him; it showed him she had need and had
     turned to him in it. Of course he would do as she asked; he would have done things far harder
     than that. He folded the slip of paper and put it away where he kept some few treasures, and
     for a time he put with it the bulb she had sent; and sometimes when he went to bed of a
     night—he had no other free time—he took both out and looked at them.</p>
    <p>But "The Good Comrade" did not remain locked away from the light of day. Joost was a
     sentimentalist, it is true, and the bulb had come from Julia, winged by an appeal from her. But
     he was also a bulb grower, and he was that before he was anything else and afterwards too, and
     the daffodil was a marvel of nature, a novelty, a thing beyond words to a connoisseur. The
     lover asked that the token should be kept hidden from the eyes of men; but the grower cried
     that the flower should be given to the light of heaven and should grow and bloom accord
     <pb n="334"/>ing to Nature's plan. For days the lover was uppermost and the old pain back. But
     in time the bitter-sweet madness died down again and, in the atmosphere which was saturated
     with the beloved work, the old love, the first and last and soundly abiding one, reasserted
     itself. The daffodil must bloom, the little brown bulb must go back to the brown earth, the
     strange flower must unfold itself to the sun and wind and rain.</p>
    <p>So he went to his father. "My father," he said, and it is to be feared he had learnt
     something of guile from the source of his bitter-sweet madness. "My father, I have heard from
     Miss Julia; she would wish us to have the narcissus 'The Good Comrade.'"</p>
    <p>Mijnheer was pleased. "That is as it should be," he said; he had felt strongly about the gift
     of the bulb in the first instance, but that was an affair over and done with long ago between
     him and his son. He did not reopen it now, he was only gratified to think there was a
     likelihood of the daffodil coming back to its birthplace, where it certainly ought to be. "How
     much does Miss Julia ask for it?" he inquired.</p>
    <p>"Nothing," Joost answered; "she does not wish to sell it; she wishes to give it back."</p>
    <p>"But, but!" Mijnheer exclaimed, pushing up his spectacles in astonishment; he knew the value
     of the thing and the offers that must have been made for it; this way was not at all his notion
     of doing business; also he found it hard to reconcile with the Julia he remembered. He
     recollected talk he had had with her when she had proved herself an apt pupil in trade and
     trade dealings, and shown, not only a very good comprehension of such things, but also an eye
     to the main chance. "This is nonsense," he said; "it is not business."</p>
    <p>Joost looked distressed. "I gave her the bulb," he ventured; "she does not want to sell me
     back my present."
     <pb n="335"/></p>
    <p>Mijnheer did not recognise any such distinction in business transactions, and for a little it
     looked as if "The Good Comrade" would be sent wandering again, sacrificed to his old-fashioned
     notions of integrity. Joost should not have it unless he paid for it, he said so with decision.
     He himself would buy it if Joost would not, and if she would not sell it to him then neither of
     them should have it.</p>
    <p>And Joost could not, even if he would, explain why and how the paying was so difficult. He
     used all the arguments he could; indeed, for one of his nature, he spoke with considerable
     diplomacy.</p>
    <p>"Supposing," he said at last, "that it was only a sport, and that next year it reverts and is
     blue as are the others, the parent bulbs? Miss Julia thinks of that—she would not like to be
     paid for it now in case of such a thing, will you not at least wait until the spring? She has
     given nothing for it herself; it is not as if she had sunk money and wants an immediate
     return."</p>
    <p>Mijnheer did not consider that made any difference and he said so, reading his son a lecture
     on business morality according to his standard, of a very severe order. Joost listened with
     meekness to the entirely undeserved reproof for meanness and dishonourable views; then the old
     man announced finally what he should do. He should write to Julia and offer her a smallish sum
     down in case the bulb proved to be of no great worth, and a promise of a proportional
     percentage afterwards if it proved valuable. This idea pleased him very well; it satisfied his
     notions of integrity and fair dealing and also his thrifty soul, which found trying the
     otherwise unavoidable duty of paying a long price for what had been freely given. From this
     Joost could not move him, so there was nothing for him to do but write distressfully to Julia
     and explain and apologise.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>
    <head>THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE</head>
    <p>Julia was at work in the kitchen; it was ten o'clock on a November morning and she was busy;
     Captain Polkington had had breakfast up-stairs, he often did now, and it delayed the morning's
     work. Mr. Gillat brought in two letters which the postman had left; both were for Julia, but
     she had not time to read them now, so she put them down on the table; they would keep; she did
     not feel greatly interested to know what was inside them. Things did not interest her as they
     used; in some imperceptible way she had aged; some of the elasticity and youth was gone,
     perhaps because hope was gone. It had been dying all the summer, ever since the day when she
     crouched behind the chopping-block; but gently and gradually, as the year dies, with some
     beauties unknown in early days and little recurrent spurts of hope and youth, like the flowers
     that bloom into winter's lap. But it was dead now; there had come to her, as it were, a sudden
     frost, and, as befalls in the years, too, the late blooming flowers, the coloured leaves, the
     last beautiful clinging remnants of life withered all at once and fell away. It was
     unreasonable, perhaps, that the Captain's theft of the daffodil and what arose from it should
     have had this result; but then it was possibly unreasonable that hope and youth should have had
     any autumn at all and not died right off when she said "No" and meant it that after
     <pb n="337"/>noon in the early summer. But then the mind of man—and woman—is unreasonable.</p>
    <p>It was nearly half-an-hour later when Julia picked up the letters; both were from Holland;
     one, she fancied, was from Mijnheer, one from his son. She opened the latter first; she rather
     wondered what Joost could have to write about; he had acknowledged the receipt of the daffodil
     bulb long ago. The matter was soon explained; the letter was as formal and precise as ever, but
     the emotion that dictated it, the distress and regret, was quite clear to Julia in spite of the
     primness of expression. Clear, too, to her were the conflicting feelings that lay behind the
     lover's contrition for what he feared was abuse of his mistress's trust, and the grower's
     desire that the treasured token should be resolved into, what it was, a wonderful bulb, a
     triumph of the horticulturist. Julia smiled a little sadly as she read; not that she regretted
     the existence of the grower with the lover; she was glad to see it and to know that it was
     triumphing. But the whole affair seemed so far off, so unimportant, so almost childish. She did
     not care who knew he had the daffodil, or whether it bloomed or rotted. In these days, when her
     self-apportioned burden was beginning to press heavily upon her shoulders, such things did not
     seem to matter. She had a sense almost of disloyalty in feeling how little it mattered to her
     when it appeared to be so much to this loyal friend.</p>
    <p>Captain Polkington had of late had several sudden attacks of a faintness which more often
     than not amounted to unconsciousness. "Heart," the doctor had said when he was summoned after
     the first one; he had not regarded them as very dangerous, that is to say not likely to prove
     fatal at any moment if properly treated at the time. He had given instructions as to suitable
     treatment, emphasis
     <pb n="338"/>ing the fact that the patient ought never to be long out of ear-shot of some one,
     as the attacks required immediate remedy. He forbade excitement and much exertion, orders easy
     to fulfil in this case, and also stimulants of all sorts, an order not quite so easy. Captain
     Polkington was much displeased about this last; he said it plainly showed the doctor a fool who
     did not know his business; stimulant, as every one knew, being the first necessity for a weak
     heart. Julia pointed out that that must vary with the constitution, nature and disease; she
     also recalled the fact that alcohol never had suited her father. He was naturally not convinced
     by her logic, and so was decidedly sulky; even in time, by dint of dwelling upon the subject,
     came to regard the treatment as a conspiracy to annoy him. Julia regretted this but did not
     think it mattered very much, seeing that she had the keys; but then she did not know of that
     purchase made in the town. The Captain, rebelling against the doctor's order, hugged himself as
     he thought of it and of the comparatively sparing use he had made of it so far—for fear of
     being found out. There was no need of him to die by inches while he had that store of life and
     comfort; so he told himself, and secretly made use of it, with anything but good result. Julia,
     marking the disimprovement in his health, thought it was the natural course and saved him all
     work, carrying out the doctor's instructions more carefully than ever. The hidden whisky
     remained unknown to her, for although in the larger affairs of duplicity and diplomacy she
     easily outmatched her father, in matters requiring small cunning he was much nearer her equal.
     In this one he showed almost preternatural skill; his whole heart was in it, and his wits,
     where it was concerned, were sharpened above the average; he clung to his secret as a man
     clings to his one chance of life, made only the
     <pb n="339"/> more pertinacious by the contrary advice he had received. But on that November
     morning, after Julia had brought her father round by the proper remedies, she began to have
     suspicions. They were not founded on anything definite; she could not imagine how he should
     have got stimulant, and his condition hardly justified her in suspecting it, yet she did. And
     Captain Polkington knew by experience that that was enough to prove unpleasant; it did not
     matter much at which end Julia got hold of his affairs, she had a knack of arriving at the
     middle before he was at all ready for her. He resented what she said to him that morning very
     much indeed. He denied everything and defended himself well; although he was in fear all the
     time that some unwary word or unwise denial should betray him to his cross-examiner who, being
     herself no mean expert in the double-dealing arts, could frequently learn as much from a lie as
     from the truth. In the end, what between anxiety and annoyance, he lost control of his temper
     and from peevish irritability broke out suddenly into a fit of weak ungovernable rage. Julia
     was obliged at once to desist, seeing with regret that she had transgressed one of the doctor's
     rules and excited the patient very much indeed.</p>
    <p>She left him to recover control of himself and went to look for Mr. Gillat.</p>
    <p>"Johnny," she said, when she found him. "I believe father has got whisky. I don't know where,
     but I shall have to find out; you must help me."</p>
    <p>Johnny professed his willingness, looking puzzled and unhappy; he looked so at times, again
     now, for even he had begun to discern a shadow coming on the life which for a year had been so
     happy to him.</p>
    <p>"You will have to keep a watch on father," Julia said. "He won't do much while I am watching;
     he will wait till
     <pb n="340"/> he is alone with you. Don't try to prevent him; that is no good; just watch and
     tell me."</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat said he would, though he did not like the job, and certainly was ill-fitted for
     it. Julia knew that, but knew also that to discover anything she must depend a good deal upon
     him, unless she could by searching light upon the store of spirit which she could not help
     thinking her father had in or near the house. She determined to make a systematic search; but
     before she did so she found time to open Mijnheer's letter.</p>
    <p>It was rather a long letter and very neat. It set forth in formal Dutch the old man's ideas
     concerning the daffodil bulb and his offer regarding it. It should be kept, he said, if it was
     paid for, not otherwise. Something now, she was to name her terms, while it was still uncertain
     whether its flower would be blue or streaked or even common yellow—more later, in accordance
     with the flowering and the profits likely to arise.</p>
    <p>So Julia read and sat staring. An offer for "The Good Comrade." Money from the people to whom
     it had always practically belonged in her estimation. She could not take it from them, it was
     impossible; the thing was virtually their own! But if she did not. She re-read Joost's letter
     with its protestations, and Mijnheer's with its offer—if she did not, the little brown bulb
     would be sent back to her. Mijnheer, now that he knew of its coming, would insist on its return
     unless it were paid for; and Joost, she knew very well, would not deceive his father and keep
     it secretly, or defy his father and keep it openly; the money or the bulb she must have. And
     the bulb she could not, would not have again; so the money, unearned, distasteful, having a not
     too pleasant savour, must be hers. At last, in this way, without her contriv
     <pb n="341"/>ance, against her will, there had come a way to pay the debt of honour!</p>
    <p>She sat down and wrote to Mijnheer and named her price. Thirty pounds she asked for, no more
     in the future, no less now; that was the only price she could take for "The Good Comrade," it
     was the sum Rawson-Clew had paid to his cousin two years ago.</p>
    <p>Johnny posted the letter that afternoon while Julia began her search for her father's hidden
     whisky.</p>
    <p>All the afternoon Captain Polkington sat in the easy-chair, watching her contemptuously when
     she was in sight and moving uneasily when she was not. He did not think she would find
     anything, at least not at once, though he was afraid she would if she kept on long enough and
     he left his treasure in its present hiding-place. It would not last so much longer—he dared not
     contemplate the time when it should all be gone; it was characteristic of him that he was
     easily able to avoid doing so. The principal thought in his mind was a determination that it
     should not be found while any remained. That could not and should not happen; the last little
     which he had carefully hoarded, which he had stinted and deprived himself to save—to have that
     taken away, to be robbed of that—the tears gathered in his eyes at the pathos of the
     thought.</p>
    <p>But the whisky was not found that day, and the Captain, who slept but badly at this time, lay
     awake long in the night planning how and when he could move it to a place of safety further
     away from the house. He would have gone down then and there, in spite of the fact that it was a
     blustering night of wind and rain and he not fitted to go out in such weather, but he was
     afraid of Julia. She was certain to hear and follow; she had almost an animal's alertness when
     once she was on the
     <pb n="342"/> trail of anything. So he lay and planned and waited, hoping that a chance would
     come during the next day.</p>
    <p>It did not. Julia was at home all day and, as she had foreseen, he made no move while she was
     about. But the following morning she had to go to Halgrave about the killing of a pig; Johnny
     was hardly equal to making the necessary arrangements and certainly could not do so good as
     she. Accordingly, she went herself, not very reluctantly, for she was nearly certain her father
     would make an effort to get at his whisky, if he had any, as soon as her back was turned, and
     so give Johnny a chance of finding out about it. Of course it was quite likely that Johnny,
     being Johnny, would miss the chance, but he might not, and even if he did they would not be
     much worse off than before. So she thought as she started, leaving the Captain, who was still
     in bed, with a very vague idea as to when she would be back.</p>
    <p>He was a good deal annoyed by this vagueness; it meant he would have to hurry, a thing he
     hated and did very badly; and, perhaps, entirely without reason, too, for she might be three
     hours gone; though, equally of course, only two, or perhaps—she was capable of anything
     unpleasant and unexpected—only one. He began to dress as quickly as he could; but, owing to
     long habit of doing it as slowly as he could so as to postpone more arduous tasks, that was not
     very fast. He wished he had known sooner that Julia was going to Halgrave, he would have begun
     getting up before this; he would even have got to breakfast if only she had let him know; so he
     fumed to himself as he shuffled about, dropping things with his shaking fingers. At last he was
     dressed and came down-stairs to find Johnny, pink and apologetic as he used to be in the
     Marbridge days, laboriously doing odd jobs which did not need doing.
     <pb n="343"/></p>
    <p>There was not a detective lost in Mr. Gillat, he had not the making of a sleuth-hound in him;
     or even a watch-dog, except, perhaps, of that well-meaning kind which gets itself perennially
     kicked for incessant and incurable tail wagging at inopportune times. The half-hour which
     followed Captain Polkington's coming down-stairs was a trying one. The Captain went to the back
     door to look out; Mr. Gillat followed him, though scarcely like his shadow; he was not
     inconspicuous, and neither he nor his motive were easy to overlook. The Captain said something
     approbious about the weather and the high wind and occasional heavy swishes of rain; then he
     went to the sitting-room which lay behind the kitchen, and near to the front door. Johnny
     followed him, and the Captain faced round on him, irritably demanding what the devil he
     wanted.</p>
    <p>"To—to see if the register is shut," Mr. Gillat said, beaming at his own deep diplomacy and
     the brilliancy of the idea which had come to him—rather tardily, it is true, still in time to
     pass muster.</p>
    <p>The Captain flung himself into a chair with a sigh of irritation. "It is a funny thing I
     can't be let alone a moment," he said. "I came in here for a little quiet and coolness, I
     didn't want you dodging after me."</p>
    <p>"No," Johnny agreed amiably; "no, of course not." Then, after a long pause, as if he had just
     made sure of the fact, "It is cool in here."</p>
    <p>It was, very; it might even have been called cold and raw, for there had not been a fire
     there for days, but the Captain did not move, and Johnny, stooping by the fire-place, examined
     the register of the chimney, fondly believing in his own impenetrable deceptiveness.</p>
    <p>"I can't help thinking it ought to be shut," he observed,
     <pb n="344"/> looking thoughtfully up the chimney; "the rain will come down; it might rain a
     good deal if the wind were to drop."</p>
    <p>"The wind is not going to drop for hours," the Captain snapped; "it is getting higher."</p>
    <p>A great gust rumbled in the chimney as he spoke, and flung itself with the thud of a palpable
     body against the window-pane. Mr. Gillat heard it; he could not well do otherwise. "Still," he
     said, "it might rain; one never knows."</p>
    <p>He took hold of the register with the tongs and tried to shut it. It was obstinate, and he
     pulled this way and that, working in his usual laborious and conscientious way. At last it
     slipped and he managed to get it jammed crossways. Thus he had to leave it, for Captain
     Polkington, apparently cool enough now, wandered back into the kitchen.</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat, of course, followed and arranged and rearranged pots on the stove till the
     Captain said he had left his handkerchief up-stairs. Stairs were trying to his heart, so Johnny
     had to go for it. Up he went as fast as he could, and came down again almost faster, for he
     tumbled on the second step and slipped the rest of the way with considerable noise and
     bumping.</p>
    <p>After that Captain Polkington gave up his efforts to get rid of his guard and resigned
     himself to fate. At least, so thought Mr. Gillat, who no amount of experience could instruct in
     the guilt of the human race in general and the Polkingtons in particular. The first hour of
     Julia's absence had passed when Johnny went into the back kitchen to clean knives. He left the
     door between the rooms open, but from habit more than from any thought of keeping an eye on his
     charge. They had been talking in the ordinary way for some time now, the Captain sitting so
     peacefully by the fire that Mr. Gillat had
     <pb n="345"/> begun to forget he was supposed to watch. And really it would seem he was
     justified, for the Captain, of his own accord, left the easy-chair and followed him into the
     back kitchen, standing watching the knife-cleaning. He had been talking of old times, recalling
     far back incidents regretfully; he continued to do so as he watched Johnny at work until he was
     interrupted by a loud sizzling in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>"Hullo!" he said, "there's a pot boiling over!" and he made as if he would go to it but half
     stopped. "It is the big one," he said, "perhaps you had better take it off; I'm not good at
     lifting weights now-a-days."</p>
    <p>"No, no!" Johnny said hastily; "don't you do it, you leave it to me," and he hurried into the
     kitchen to take from the fire a pot which, had he only remembered it, had not been so near the
     blaze when he left it.</p>
    <p>"It is too heavy for you," he went on as he lifted it; "I don't know what is inside, only
     water, I think; it will be all right here by the side."</p>
    <p>A gust of wind swept round the kitchen, fluttering the herbs which hung from the ceiling and
     blowing the dust and flame from the front of the fire.</p>
    <p>"Dear, dear!" Mr. Gillat exclaimed as he drew back, "What a wind!" Then, as he caught the
     whisper and whistle of the leafless things which whisper to one another out of doors even in
     the dead winter time, he realised that the outer door must be open.</p>
    <p>"Shut it!" he said. "The latch is so old, it is beginning to get worn out, and the wind is so
     strong, too. Let me see if I can shut it." He went to the back kitchen for that purpose and
     found that he was talking to empty air, the Captain was gone.</p>
    <p>In great consternation he went out after his charge. He had not had a minute's start; he
     could not have got
     <pb n="346"/> far, not much more than round the corner of the house. So thought Mr. Gillat, and
     started round the nearest corner after him. Julia would not have done that; with the instinct
     of the wild animal and the rogue for cover, and for the value of the obvious in concealment,
     she would have looked by the water butt first. It was not a hiding-place; the bush beside did
     not half conceal Captain Polkington, yet he stood dark and unobtrusive against it and so close
     to the door that in looking out for him one naturally looked beyond him. As Johnny went round
     one side of the house the Captain left the meagre shelter of the butt and went round the other,
     bent now on finding some better hiding-place till it should be safe for him to go to his
     precious store. And seeing that he was braced by an insatiable whisky thirst and so possessed
     by one idea that he had almost a madman's cunning in achieving his purpose, it is not wonderful
     that he succeeded. While Johnny hastily searched the out-buildings he lay hid. And when at last
     Mr. Gillat went back to the house, being convinced that his charge must have gone back before
     him, he, nerved and strengthened by a dose of the precious spirit, carefully climbed over the
     garden wall, carrying with him all that was left of his store. It was rather heavy, and the
     rising wind was strong, but he was strong, too, and he bore more strength with him. He could
     carry a weight and fight with the wind if he wanted to; his heart was well enough when it was
     properly treated. And it should be properly treated as long as he had his comfort, his precious
     medicine safe and in a place where prying hands could not touch it.</p>
    <p>Julia came home from Halgrave later than she expected, but the wind had increased to a gale,
     so that walking along the exposed road had been no easy matter.
     <pb n="347"/> Johnny by this time was almost desperate with alarm, for Captain Polkington had
     not come back and, in spite of a continuous search in likely and unlikely places, he had not
     been able to find any trace of him or his whisky. It is true his search was not very systematic
     at the best of times; it is not likely to have been now; as his alarm increased, it grew worse,
     until, by the time Julia came in, it had become little more than a repeated looking in the same
     unlikely places and an incessant toiling up and down-stairs and across the garden in the
     howling wind.</p>
    <p>His account of the Captain's vanishing was much obscured by self-condemnation and anxiety,
     still she managed to make it out and she did not at first think so very seriously of it. She
     concluded from it that her father had succeeded in getting at his whisky and Johnny had failed
     to prevent him or find out the whereabouts of the store—a not very astonishing occurrence. The
     fact that the Captain had not returned or shown himself for so long was surprising and to be
     regretted, seeing the badness of the weather. But it was not inexplicable; he might be anxious
     to demonstrate his freedom, or, by frightening them, to pay them out for the watch lately kept
     on him; or—and this was the one serious aspect of the matter—he might have taken more of the
     spirit than he could stand in his weak state and be too stupid and muddled to come back alone.
     Julia reassured Johnny as well as she could, and then, accompanied by him, set to work to
     search thoroughly the house, garden and out-buildings.</p>
    <p>It was dinner time before they had finished. Julia came to the doorway of the bulb shed
     uneasy and perplexed. "It is clear he is not here," she said, and turned to fasten the door. A
     gust of wind tore it from her hand, flinging it back noisily. She caught it again and secured
     <pb n="348"/> it. "It is dinner time," she said; "come along indoors, there is no reason why
     you should go hungry because father chooses to."</p>
    <p>Johnny followed her to the house. When they were indoors he said, "Do you think—you don't
     think he has had an attack?—that he is lying unconscious somewhere?" That was precisely what
     Julia was beginning to think; there seemed no other possible explanation. Johnny read her mind
     in her face and was overwhelmed with the sense of his own shortcomings and their possible
     consequences.</p>
    <p>"It is not your fault," Julia assured him; "you might as well say it is father's for being so
     foolish and obstinate about his whisky—a great deal better and more truly say it is mine for
     leaving you, and for driving him into this corner, for not having managed the whole thing
     better."</p>
    <p>Johnny, though a little relieved that she did not think him to blame, was not comforted. "Let
     us go and find him," he said; "we must find him; never mind about dinner—we must go and look
     for him—though I don't know where."</p>
    <p>"We must look beyond the garden," Julia said; "he must have got further than we first
     thought—but I don't see how he can be far in this weather. Cut some cheese and bread; we can
     eat it as we go along."</p>
    <p>In a little while they set out together, Julia taking restoratives with her, though she was
     also careful to leave some on the kitchen-table in case Captain Polkington should make his way
     back and feel in need of them in her absence. Outside the garden wall one felt the force of the
     wind more fully, and realised how impossible it was that the Captain should have gone far.
     Julia stood a moment by the gate. Before her lay the road to Halgrave; her father might have
     gone down it a little way; but if he had he must have turned off and sought conceal
     <pb n="349"/>ment somewhere for she had seen no sign of any one when she came home. To the left
     stretched the heath-land, brown and bare, to the belt of wildly tossing pines; it was hard to
     imagine her father choosing that way. To the right lay the sandhills, a place of unsteady
     outline, earth and sky alike pale and blurred as the north-west wind fled seawards, lifting and
     whirling the fine particles till the air seemed full of them; it was impossible to think of any
     one choosing that way.</p>
    <p>"We will go down the road to begin with," Julia said, and started.</p>
    <p>All through the early part of the afternoon they searched; sometimes stopped for a moment by
     a gust of wind; Julia caught and whirled, Johnny brought to a panting standstill. But on again
     directly, struggling down the road, looking in ditches and behind scant bushes, leaving the
     track first on the right hand then on the left, searching in likely and unlikely places. But
     always with the same result, there was no sign of the missing man. At last, when they had
     reached a greater distance than it was possible to imagine the Captain could have gone, they
     turned towards the house across the heath. It was difficult to think of the Captain going that
     way, seeing he would have been walking in the teeth of the wind, but it almost seemed he must
     have done it.</p>
    <p>The short day was already beginning to close in when they reached the belt of pines. It had
     grown much colder; one could almost believe there would be frost in the air by and by. The wind
     was lulling a little; it still roared with strange rushings and half-demented tearings at the
     tree-tops, almost like some great spirit prisoned there, but it had spent its first strength.
     The rain clouds were going, too; already in places the sky was swept clear so that a pale light
     gleamed behind the trees.
     <pb n="350"/></p>
    <p>Julia stood in the vibrant shelter of the pines, pushing back her hair; she was bareheaded; a
     hat had been an impossible superfluity when she started out.</p>
    <p>"Johnny," she said, "we have come too far; father could not have got to the trees in such
     weather as it was when he started; we must go back. I expect he is somewhere nearer home; we
     have not half searched the possible radius yet."</p>
    <p>Johnny said "Yes." He was dog-tired, so tired that his anxiety was now little more than dull
     despair animated by an unquestioning determination to continue the search.</p>
    <p>He would have done so somehow, and with his flagging energies been more hindrance than help,
     had not Julia prevented him; as they neared the house, now almost merged in the dusk, she
     said—</p>
    <p>"I am going to fetch a lantern; the moon will be up soon, but until then I shall want a
     light. I am just coming in to get it, then I shall go out again; but you must stop at home;
     father may come back, and if he found us both out after dark he would think something was wrong
     and start to look for us; then we should be worse off than ever."</p>
    <p>Johnny said "Yes"; but suggested, "I think we'd better look round about the house once more.
     I think I'll take a light and look round again."</p>
    <p>Julia did not think it would be much use; however she consented, though she had to go with
     Johnny; she did not trust him with a lantern among the out-buildings. They looked round once
     more, in the sheds and in the dark garden; afterwards they went out and looked beyond the wall
     all round, on the side where the heather grew and also on the side where the loose sand came
     close. It took time; Johnny was too tired to move quickly or
     <pb n="351"/> even to understand quickly what was said to him. At last Julia stopped and spoke
     decisively.</p>
    <p>"You had better go in now," she said; "it won't do for us both to be out any longer; one of
     us must go in, and I think it had better be you. Make a good fire, see that there is plenty of
     hot water and get something to eat so as to be ready to do things when I come back."</p>
    <p>Johnny acquiesced and Julia, having watched him into the house, took up her lantern and set
     out in the direction of the sandhills.</p>
    <p>It was her last resource; it did not seem to her likely that her father could have gone
     there; at the best of times he disliked the place, finding it very tiring. Still, with the wind
     behind him as it would have been this morning, it is possible he would have found it the
     easiest way—if he could have managed to forget what the coming back would be. At all events she
     determined to try it, so she set out for the waste.</p>
    <p>By this time the moon was rising, and, in spite of the driving clouds which had not all
     dispersed, at times it shone clear. Beneath it the stretch of sand lay pale and desolate, a
     new-formed landscape of fresh contours, loosely-piled hills and shallow scooped hollows shaped
     by to-day's wind. An easy place for a man to miss his way with a gale blowing and the sand
     dancing blinding reels. A hard place for a man to travel far when he had to face the wind; a
     strong man would have found it very tiring, a weak man might well have given it up, driven to
     waiting for a lull in the weather. As for a man in the Captain's health—when Julia thought of
     it she hurried on, although she knew if her father had to-day, as he had all through his life,
     followed the line of least resistance, the chances were that her help would be of little avail
     to him now.</p>
    <p>She carried her lantern low, looking carefully for foot
     <pb n="352"/>prints; soon, however, she put it out; she would do better without in the
     increasing moon-light. But she found no prints; after all, as she remembered, she was hardly
     likely to; the wind and blowing sand would have obliterated them. Over the first level of sand
     she went to the nearest rise without seeing anything; up to that and down the following hollow,
     looking in every curve and indentation, still without seeing anything. Then she began to climb
     the next rise. The moon was struggling through a long cloud, one moment eclipsed, the next
     shining with a half radiance which made the landscape unevenly black and white. For a second it
     looked out clear, and the sand showed like silver, tear-spotted with ink in the hollows; then
     the cloud swept up and all turned to a level grey. She had climbed to the top of a rise by now,
     sinking deep and noiseless into the soft sand. It was too dark to see what was below; all was
     shadow, black shadow—or was it a blackness more substantial than shadow?</p>
    <p>The cloud passed from off the moon's face, the light shone out once more, turning the sand to
     silver. All the great empty space, where the dying wind still throbbed, was white silver,
     except down in the hollow where, black and still, lay the man who had followed the line of
     least resistance.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
    <head>PAYMENT AND RECEIPT</head>
    <p>On the day of Captain Polkington's funeral, a letter was brought to White's Cottage. Julia
     herself took it in, and when she saw that it was from Holland she asked the postman to wait a
     minute as she would be glad if he would post a letter for her. He sat down, nothing loth; the
     cottage was the last place on his round and he never minded a rest there. He waited while Julia
     went up-stairs with her letter. She opened it before she got to her room and barely read the
     contents; there was enclosed a cheque for thirty pounds, the price of "The Good Comrade."</p>
    <p>It had come, then, at last, this money for which she had been waiting two years—but too late.
     The man in whose name she would have paid the debt lay dead. She had planned to clear him
     without his knowledge, reinstate him in the good opinion of his debtor without letting her hand
     be seen; and she could not, for he was dead, and there was no hand but hers, and no name to
     clear. It was not a week too late, yet so much, so bitterly much. Too late for her cherished
     plan, too late for any of the things she had hoped, too late for triumph, or joy, or
     satisfaction; too late to demonstrate the once hoped for equality; too late for the fulfilling
     of anything but a dogged purpose. For a moment she looked at the cheque, feeling the irony
     which had sent her the means of paying
     <pb n="354"/> his debt now that her father lay in his coffin, indifferent to his good name and
     his honour; unable, alike, to clear or be cleared, to wrong or be wronged; removed by kindly
     death from the scope of earthly judgment, even the just thoughts of one who had suffered on his
     account.</p>
    <p>She put down the cheque and pencilled some hasty words—"In payment of Captain Polkington's
     debt (to Mr. Rawson-Clew) discharged by Hubert Farquhar Rawson-Clew on the—November 19—"</p>
    <p>So she wrote, then she put the slip with the cheque in an envelope and addressed it to the
     London club where the explosive had been sent.</p>
    <p>"It will be posted before the funeral," she thought; "I'm glad—it will all end together—poor
     father!"</p>
    <p>She went down-stairs and gave the letter to the postman. Mrs. Polkington came into the
     kitchen as she was doing so, for Mrs. Polkington was at the cottage now.</p>
    <p>There are some women who seem designed by nature for widows, just as there are others
     designed for grandmothers and yet others for old maids. Mrs. Polkington was of the first sort;
     she seemed specially created to adorn the position of widow-hood; she certainly did adorn it;
     she was a pattern to all widows and did not miss a single point of the situation. Of course she
     came to the cottage as soon as possible after receiving news of her husband's death. The
     journey was long and expensive, the weather somewhat bad; that weighed for nothing with her;
     she was there as soon as might be, feeling, saying and doing just what a bereaved widow ought.
     The fact that she and her husband had been obliged through the force of circumstances, to live
     separate the past year did not alter her emotions, her real tears or her real grief.
     Considering the practice and experience she had had it would have been surprising if she had
     not succeeded in
     <pb n="355"/> deceiving herself as well as most of her world in these things. So acute were her
     feelings that when she came into the kitchen and saw Julia dispatching the letter, she felt
     quite a shock.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" she asked; "What is the matter?"</p>
    <p>"Only a letter that could not wait," Julia answered.</p>
    <p>"Surely it could have waited till to-morrow," her mother said; "under the circumstances
     surely one would be excused."</p>
    <p>Julia thought differently but did not say so, and in silence set about some necessary
     preparation.</p>
    <p>The Reverend Richard Frazer came to the funeral; Violet was unable to do so; he represented
     her and supported his mother-in-law too. The banker, Mr. Ponsonby, also made the tedious
     journey to Halgrave; he came out of respect for death in the abstract, and also because he
     expected affairs would want looking to, and it would suit him better to do it now than later.
     These two with Johnny, Julia and her mother, were the only mourners at the funeral; a few
     village folk, moved by curiosity, attended, but no one else; there was not even an empty
     carriage, representative of a good family, following the humble cortège. Mrs. Polkington
     observed this and felt it; an empty carriage and good livery following would have given her
     satisfaction, without in any way diminishing her sorrow and proper feeling. It is conceivable
     she would have found satisfaction in being shipwrecked in aristocratic company, without at the
     same time, suffering less than she ought to suffer.</p>
    <p>After the funeral they returned to the cottage and had a repast of Julia's providing,
     eminently suitable to the occasion. Everything was eminently suitable, every one's behaviour,
     every one's clothes; Mr. Frazer's grave face, the banker's jerky manner—the manner of a man con
     <pb n="356"/>cerned with the world's money market and ill at ease in the intrusive presence of
     death. Mrs. Polkington's voice, face, feelings, sayings, everything. Julia's own behaviour was
     perfect, though all the time she saw how it looked as plainly as if she had been another and
     disinterested person, and once or twice she had an hysterical desire to applaud a good stroke
     of her mother's or prompt a backward speech of her uncle's. Mr. Gillat, of course, did nothing
     suitable; he never did. He kept up a preternaturally cheerful appearance during the meal,
     stopping his mouth with large corks of bread, answering "Ah, yes, yes, just so,"
     indiscriminately whenever he was spoken to, and starting three separate conversations on the
     weather on his own account. As soon as the table was cleared, he fled into the back kitchen,
     shut himself in with the dishes, and was seen no more. The others remained in the sitting-room
     and talked things over, arranging plans for the future and for the immediate present. And when
     the time came and the conveyance was brought to the gate, they set out on the homeward journey
     together. Johnny did not come out of the kitchen to say good-bye; only Julia came to the
     gate.</p>
    <p>Mr. Ponsonby was going back home; Mr. Frazer and Mrs. Polkington were going with him to spend
     the night in town and go on westwards the next morning. Mr. Frazer was anxious to get back to
     his parish, and Mrs. Polkington to her daughter, who was expecting her first baby shortly. It
     was this expected event which prevented the young rector from asking Julia to stay with him and
     Violet until such time as she and her mother could settle somewhere together. It was this same
     event which prevented Mrs. Polkington from remaining at White's Cottage and sharing Julia's
     solitude until their plans were settled. All this was explained to Julia in the best Polk
     <pb n="357"/>ington manner and she seemed quite satisfied with the explanation. Mr. Ponsonby
     had to be perforce; there seemed no alternative; all the same he was not quite pleased. It was
     all sensible enough, of course, only as he saw Julia standing at the gate in the November
     afternoon, he did not quite like it.</p>
    <p>"Look here," he said shortly, "you shut up this place here, send Mr. Gillat to his friends,
     or his rooms, or wherever he came from, and come to me. You can come and make your home with
     me, and welcome, till things are settled; there's plenty of room."</p>
    <p>This was a good deal for Mr. Ponsonby to say, considering what an annoyance the Polkington
     family had been to him, how—not without wisdom—he had set his face against letting them into
     his house for more than twenty-four hours at a stretch, and how much this particular member had
     thwarted and exasperated him at their last meeting. Julia recognised this and recognised also
     the kindness of the brusque suggestion. She thanked him warmly for the offer though she refused
     it, assuring him that she and Johnny would be all right at the cottage.</p>
    <p>"We do not find it lonely," she said; "we are quite happy here, happier than anywhere else, I
     think."</p>
    <p>The banker grunted, not convinced; Mr. Frazer shook hands with Julia and said he hoped it
     would not be long before he saw her; Mrs. Polkington reiterated the remark, kissing her the
     while; then they drove away and Julia went into the house. She went into the back kitchen; Mr.
     Gillat was not there; the dishes were all put away and the place was quite tidy. Julia went
     through to the front kitchen; there she saw Johnny; he was kneeling by the Captain's old chair,
     his arms thrown across the seat, his silly pink face buried in them, his rounded shoulders
     shaking with sobs.
     <pb n="358"/></p>
    <p>Johnny loved as a dog loves, without reason, without thought of return; not for wisdom, worth
     or deserts, just because he did love and, having once loved, loved always; forgiving
     everything, expecting nothing—foolish, faithful, true. So he loved his friend, so he mourned
     him now, be-blubbering the seat of the shabby chair which spoke so eloquently to him of the
     irritable, exacting presence now gone for ever.</p>
    <p>"Johnny," Julia said softly; "Johnny dear."</p>
    <p>She put a hand on the round shoulders and somehow slipped herself into the shabby chair.</p>
    <p>"Johnny," she said, "let us sit by the fire awhile and not talk of anything at all."</p>
    <p>So they sat together till twilight fell.</p>
    <p>The next day there came another to Julia, one who knew nothing of what had befallen in these
     last days. It was almost twilight when he came; Johnny had gone out to collect fir-cones; Julia
     sent him, partly because their stock was low and partly because she thought it would do him
     good. She did not expect him back much before five o'clock; it would be dark by then certainly,
     but not very dark for the day was clear, with a touch of frost in the air; one of those days
     when the last of the sunset burns low down in the sky long after the stars are out. It was not
     much after four o'clock when Julia heard something approaching, certainly not Johnny nor
     anything connected with him, for it was the throb of a motor coming fast. Only once before
     since she had been at the cottage had she heard that sound on the lonely road, on the day when
     Rawson-Clew came. It could not be him now, she was sure of that. He might have received the
     money this morning certainly, but he would not come because of that, rather he would keep away;
     there was no reason why he should come. She told herself it was
     <pb n="359"/> impossible, and then went to the door to see, puzzled in her own mind what she
     should say if the impossible had happened and it was he.</p>
    <p>The throbbing had ceased by now; there was the click of the gate even as she opened the door,
     and he—it was he and no other—was coming up the little brick path in the twilight. His face was
     curiously clear in the light which lingered low down; and when she saw it and the look it wore,
     all plans of what she should say fled, and the feeling came upon her which was like that which
     came when she crouched behind the chopping-block and he barred the way. It seemed as if he had
     been pursuing and she escaping and eluding for a long time, but now—he was coming up the path
     and she was standing in the doorway with the pale light strong on her face and nowhere to fly
     to and no way of escape.</p>
    <p>"Why did you not tell me before?" he said without any greeting at all, and he spoke as if he
     had right and authority. "Why did you let this thing weigh on you for two years and never say a
     word of it to me?"</p>
    <p>"I was ashamed," she answered with truth. Then the spirit which still inhabits some women,
     making them willing to be won by capture, prompted her to struggle against the capitulation she
     was ready to make. "There was nothing to speak of to you or any one else," she said, with an
     effort at her old assurance, and she led the way in as she spoke. "I never meant to speak of it
     at all, I meant just to pay the debt as from father, and not myself appear in it. I did not do
     it that way, I know; I could not; I did not get the money till yesterday and—and"—the assurance
     faded away pathetically—"that was too late."</p>
    <p>Rawson-Clew looked down, and for the first time noticed her mourning dress, and realising
     what it meant,
     <pb n="360"/> remembered that convention demanded that a man, whose claim depends on another's
     death, should not push it as soon as the funeral is over. However he did not go away, the
     pathos of Julia's voice kept him.</p>
    <p>"Late or early would have made little difference," he said; "it is just the same now as if it
     had been early. Do you think I should not have known who sent the money at whatever time and in
     whatever circumstances it was paid? Do you think I know two people who would pay a debt, which
     can hardly be said to exist, in such a way?"</p>
    <p>But Julia was not comforted. "It is too late," she re-repeated; "too late for any
     satisfaction. I thought I would prove that we were honest and honourable by paying it; I wanted
     to show father—that I—that our standard was the same as yours, and I have not."</p>
    <p>"No," he answered, "you have not and you never will; your standard is not the same as mine;
     mine is the honour of an accepted convention, and yours is the honour of a personal truth, a
     personal experience, the honour of the soul."</p>
    <p>But she shook her head. "It is not really," she said; "and father—"</p>
    <p>"As to your father," he interrupted gently, "do you not think that sometimes the potter's
     thumb slips in the making of a vessel?"</p>
    <p>She looked up with a feeling of gratitude. "Yes," she said; "yes, that is it, if only we
     could realise it—poor father. It was partly our fault, too, mother's, all of ours—and he is
     dead now."</p>
    <p>"I know. Let him rest in peace; we are concerned no more with his doings or misdoings; our
     concern, yours and mine is with the living."</p>
    <p>She did not answer; a piece of wood had fallen from
     <pb n="361"/> the fire and lay blazing and spluttering on the hearth; she stooped to pick it up
     and he watched her.</p>
    <p>"I know I have no business here now," he said. "Had I known of his death before, I would not
     have come to-day; I would have waited, but since I have come—Julia—"</p>
    <p>She was standing straight now, the wood safely back in the fire; he put his hands on her
     shoulders and turned her to him. "Julia, you and I have always dealt openly, without regarding
     appearances, let us deal so now—since I have come. Won't you let me give you a receipt?"</p>
    <p>Julia said afterwards that receipts for the payment of such debts were unnecessary and never
     given; which was perhaps as well, for the one she received in the dusk was not of a kind
     recognised at law. Could it afterwards have been produced it would not have proved the payment
     of money, though at the time it proved several things, principally the fact that, though
     friendship and comradeship are fine and excellent things, there are simple primitive passions
     which leap up through them and transfigure them and forget them, and it is these which make man
     man, and woman woman, and life worth living, and the world worth winning and losing, too, and
     bring the kingdom of heaven to earth again.</p>
    <p>It also proved how exceedingly firmly a man who is in the habit of wearing a single eyeglass
     must screw it into his eye, for, as Julia remarked with some surprise, the one which interested
     her did not fall out.</p>
    <p>Mr. Gillat came home with his fir-cones at a quarter to five. And when he came he saw that,
     to him, most fascinating sight—a motor-car, standing empty and quiet
     <pb n="362"/> by the gate. He looked at it with keen interest, then he looked round the empty
     landscape for its owner, and not seeing him, wondered if he was in the house. He put away the
     cones and came to the conclusion that the owner was not there and the car was an abandoned
     derelict. For which, perhaps, he may be forgiven, for there was no light at the parlour window
     and no sound of voices that he could hear from the kitchen; even when he opened the door and
     walked in he did not in the firelight see any one besides Julia at first.</p>
    <p>"Julia," he said, bringing in the astonishing news, "there is a motor-car outside!"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Julia answered composedly; "but it is going away soon."</p>
    <p>"Not very soon," another voice spoke out of the gloom of the chimney corner, and Johnny
     jumped as he recognised it.</p>
    <p>"Dear me!" he said; "dear me! Mr. Rawson-Clew! How do you do? I am pleased to see you."</p>
    <p>The motor did not go away very soon; it stayed quite as long, rather longer, in fact, than
     Mr. Gillat expected. And when it did go, he did not have the pleasure of seeing it start; he
     somehow got shut in the kitchen while Julia went out to the gate.</p>
    <p>When she came back she shut the door carefully, then turned to him, and he noticed how her
     eyes were shining. "Johnny," she said, "I am a selfish beast; I am going to leave you. Not yet,
     oh, not yet, but one day."</p>
    <p>Johnny stared a moment, then said, "Of course, oh, of course, to be sure—to live with your
     mother, she'll want you. A wonderful woman."</p>
    <p>"Not to live with my mother," Julia said emphatically. "Sit down and I will tell you all
     about it."</p>
    <p>And she told, slowly and suitably, fearing that he
     <pb n="363"/> would hardly understand the wonderful goodness of fate to her. But she need not
     have been afraid; he took her meaning at once, far quicker than she expected, for he saw no
     wonder in it, only a very great goodness for the man who had won her, and a great and radiant
     happiness for himself in the happiness that had come to her. As for his loneliness, he never
     thought of that, why should he? Of course she would leave him, it was the right and proper
     thing to do; she would leave him anyhow.</p>
    <p>"You couldn't go on living with me here," he said; "I mean, I couldn't go on living with you;
     it wouldn't be the thing, you know; you must think of that."</p>
    <p>Julia caught her breath between tears and laughter, but he went on stoutly: "I shall go back
     to town, to Mrs. Horn; I shall like it—at least when I get used to it. It is quite time I went
     back to town; a man ought not to stay too long in the country; he gets rusty."</p>
    <p>"You won't go back to town," Julia said; "you will never do that. You will stay here in the
     cottage, and Mrs. Gray from next door to the shop will come and live here as your housekeeper;
     I am going to arrange it with her. She will come and she will bring her little grand-daughter
     and you will keep on living here always."</p>
    <p>For a moment Johnny's face beamed; the prospect was exquisite; but he sternly put it from
     him. "No," he said, "I shouldn't like that; it's kind of you, but—"</p>
    <p>"Johnny," Julia interrupted, "you should always speak the truth—you do anything else so
     badly! I don't mind if you like my plan or not, you will have to put up with it to help me;
     some one must take care of the cottage."</p>
    <p>"But you will want to come yourself," Mr. Gillat protested.</p>
    <p>"Never, unless you are here."</p>
    <p>In the end Julia had her way. Johnny lived at the
     <pb n="364"/> cottage, and Mrs. Gray and her grandchild came to keep house. And Billy, Mrs.
     Gray's nephew, came to help in the garden and take care of the donkey; in the spring there was
     a donkey added to the establishment, and a little tub-cart which held four children easily,
     besides Mr. Gillat. And it is doubtful if, in all the country round, there was a happier man
     than he who tended Julia's plants in Julia's garden, and drove parties of chattering children
     along the quiet lanes, and sat on warm summer evenings beside his old friend's grave in
     Halgrave churchyard. He had forgotten many things, old slights and old pains, and old losses;
     forgotten, perhaps, most things except love. Foolish Johnny, God's fool, basking in God's
     sunshine.</p>
    <p>And Julia and Rawson-Clew were married, very quietly, without any pomp or ostentation at all.
     And if, on the honeymoon, he did not show her all the places he had thought of on the day when
     he travelled north with the girl with the carnations, it was because he had not several years
     at his disposal just then. Afterwards he made up for it as work allowed and time could be
     found. In the record of their lives there are many days noted down as holidays, even such
     holidays as that first one spent on the Dunes. In the springtime, when the bulb flowers were in
     bloom, they went once more to the Dunes and to the little old town where the Van Heigens lived.
     They were received with much ceremony by Mijnheer and his wife, and entertained at a dinner
     which lasted from four till half-past six. It is true that afterwards state had to be lain
     aside, for Julia insisted on helping to wash the priceless Nankeen china while her husband
     smoked long cigars with Mijnheer on the veranda, but that was all her own fault. Denah came to
     tea drinking, she and her lately-wed husband, the bashful son of a well-to-do shipowner. She
     was very smiling and all bustling and
     <pb n="365"/> greatly pleased with herself and all things, and if she thought poorly of Julia
     for washing the plates, she thought very well of the glittering rings she had left on the
     veranda-table and well, too, of her husband, who she recognised as the mysterious "man of good
     family" they had seen on the day they drove to the wood. And afterwards when the tea drinking
     was done and the dew was falling, Julia walked with Joost among his flowers, and heard him
     speak of his hopes and ambitions, and knew that in his work he had found all the satisfaction
     that a man may reasonably hope for here.</p>
    <p>Later, Julia and her husband walked through the tidy streets of the town, looking in at
     lighted windows, listening to the patois of the peasants and recalling past times. It was then
     that he told her how he had that day tried to buy back the streaked daffodil.</p>
    <p>"And Mijnheer would not sell it?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"No," he answered; "not at any price, so I am afraid that you will have to do without 'The
     Good Comrade' after all."</p>
    <p>"I?" she said; "I can do quite well. Thank you for trying to get it; all the same I am not
     sure I want it back."</p>
    <p>"Do you not? Then I am quite sure that I do not, indeed, I rather fancy I already have the
     real 'Good Comrade.'"</p>
