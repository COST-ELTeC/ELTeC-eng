    <head>PREFACE.</head>
    <p>No one can be more sensible than is the Author that the present is an overgrown book
     of a nondescript class, neither the "tale" for the young, nor the novel for their elders, but a
     mixture of both.</p>
    <p>Begun as a series of conversational sketches, the story outran both the original intention
     and the limits of the periodical in which it was commenced; and, such as it has become, it is
     here presented to those who have already made acquaintance with the May family, and may be
     willing to see more of them. It would beg to be considered merely as what it calls itself, a
     Family Chronicle—a domestic record of home events, large and small, during those years of early
     life when the character is chiefly formed, and as an endeavour to trace the effects of those
     aspirations which are
     <pb n="viii"/> a part of every youthful nature. That the young should take one hint, to think
     whether their hopes and upward-breathings are truly upwards, and founded in lowliness, may be
     called the moral of the tale.</p>
    <p>For those who may deem the story too long, and the characters too numerous, the Author can
     only beg their pardon for any tedium that they may have undergone before giving it up.</p>

      <l>'Si douce est la Marguerite'—</l><p><hi>Chaucer.</hi></p></quote>
     <p>'Miss Winter , are you busy? Do you want this afternoon? Can you take a good long
      walk?'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, my dear, how often have I told you of your impetuosity— you have forgotten.'</p>
     <p>'Very well'—with an impatient twist—'I beg your pardon. Good morning, Miss Winter,' said a
      thin, lank, angular, sallow girl, just fifteen, trembling from head to foot with restrained
      eagerness, as she tried to curb her tone into the requisite civility.</p>
     <p>'Good morning, Ethel, good morning, Flora,' said the prim, middle-aged, daily governess,
      taking off her bonnet, and arranging the stiff little rolls of curl at the long, narrow
      looking-glass, the border of which distorted the countenance.</p>
     <p>'Good morning,' properly responded Flora, a pretty, fair girl, nearly two years older than
      her sister.</p>
     <p>'Will you—' began to burst from Etheldred's lips again, but was stifled by Miss Winter's
      inquiry, 'Is your mamma pretty well to-day?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! very well,' said both at once; 'she is coming to the reading.' And Flora added, 'Papa
      is going to drive her out to-day.'</p>
     <p>'I am very glad. And the baby?'</p>
     <p>'I do believe she does it on purpose!' whispered Ethel to herself, wriggling fearfully on
      the wide window-seat on which she had precipitated herself, and kicking at the bar of the
      table, by which manifestation she of course succeeded in deferring her hopes, by a reproof
      which caused her to draw herself into a rigid, melancholy attitude, a sort of penance of
      decorum, but a rapid motion of the
      <pb/> eyelids, a tendency to crack the joints of the fingers, and an unquietness at the ends
      of her shoes, betraying the restlessness of the digits therein contained.</p>
     <p>It was such a room as is often to be found in old country town houses, the two large windows
      looking out on a broad old-fashioned street, through heavy framework, and panes of glass
      scratched with various names and initials. The walls were painted blue, the skirting almost a
      third of the height, and so wide at the top as to form a narrow shelf. The fire-place,
      constructed in the days when fires were made to give as little heat as possible, was
      ornamented with blue and white Dutch tiles bearing marvellous representations of Scripture
      history, and was protected by a very tall green guard; the chairs were much of the same date,
      solid and heavy, the seats in faded carpet-work, but there was a sprinkling of lesser ones and
      of stools; a piano; a globe; a large table in the middle of the room, with three desks on it;
      a small one, and a light cane chair by each window; and loaded book-cases. Flora began, 'If
      you don't want this afternoon to yourself—'</p>
     <p>Ethel was on her feet, and open-mouthed. 'O, Miss Winter! if you would be so kind as to walk
      to Cocksmoor with us.'</p>
     <p>'To Cocksmoor, my dear!' exclaimed the governess in dismay.</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes, but hear,' cried Ethel. 'It is not for nothing. Yesterday—'</p>
     <p>'No, the day before,' interposed Flora.</p>
     <p>'There was a poor man brought into the hospital. He had been terribly hurt in the quarry,
      and papa says he'll die. He was in great distress, for his wife has just got twins, and there
      were lots of children before. They want everything—food and clothes— and we want to walk and
      take it.'</p>
     <p>'We had a collection of clothes ready, luckily,' said Flora; 'and we have a blanket, and
      some tea and some arrowroot, and a bit of bacon, and mamma says she does not think it too far
      for us to walk, if you will be so kind as to go with us.'</p>
     <p>Miss Winter looked perplexed. 'How could you carry the blanket, my dear?'</p>
     <p>'O, we have settled that,' said Ethel, 'we mean to make the donkey a sumpter-mule, so, if
      you are tired, you may ride home on her.'</p>
     <p>'But, my dear, has your mamma considered? They are such a set of wild people at Cocksmoor; I
      don't think we could walk there alone.'</p>
     <p>'It is Saturday,' said Ethel, 'we can get the boys.'</p>
     <p>'If you would reflect a little! They would be no protection. Harry would be getting into
      scrapes, and you and Mary running wild.'</p>
     <pb/>
     <p>'I wish Richard was at home!' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I know!' cried Ethel. 'Mr. Ernescliffe will come. I am sure he can walk so far now. I'll
      ask him.'</p>
     <p>Ethel had clapped after her the heavy door with its shining brass lock, before Miss Winter
      well knew what she was about, and the governess seemed annoyed. 'Ethel does not consider,'
      said she. 'I don't think your mamma will be pleased.'</p>
     <p>'Why not?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'My dear—a gentleman walking with you, especially if Margaret is going.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think he is strong enough,' said Flora; but I can't think why there should be any
      harm. Papa took us all out walking with him yesterday—little Aubrey and all, and Mr.
      Ernescliffe went.'</p>
     <p>'But, my dear—'</p>
     <p>She was interrupted by the entrance of a fine tall blooming girl of eighteen, holding in her
      hand a pretty little maid of five. 'Good morning, Miss Winter. I suppose Flora has told you
      the request we have to make to you?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, my dear Margaret, but did your mamma consider what a lawless place Cocksmoor is?'</p>
     <p>'That was the doubt,' said Margaret, but papa said he would answer for it nothing would
      happen to us, and mamma said if you would be so kind.'</p>
     <p>'It is unlucky,' began the governess, but stopped at the incursion of some new comers,
      nearly tumbling over each other, Ethel at the head of them. 'Oh! Harry!' as the gathers of her
      frock gave way in the rude grasp of a twelve-years-old boy. 'Miss Winter, 'tis all right—Mr.
      Ernescliffe says he is quite up to the walk, and will like it very much, and he will undertake
      to defend you from the quarrymen.'</p>
     <p>'Is Miss Winter afraid of the quarrymen?' hallooed Harry. 'Shall I take a club?'</p>
     <p>'I'll take my gun and shoot them,' valiantly exclaimed. Tom; and while threats were passing
      among the boys, Margaret asked, in a low voice, 'Did you ask him to come with us?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, he said he should like it of all things. Papa was there, and said it was not too far
      for him—besides, there's the donkey. Papa says it, so we must go, Miss Winter.'</p>
     <p>Miss Winter glanced unutterable things at Margaret, and Ethel began to perceive she had done
      something wrong. Flora was going to speak, when Margaret, trying to appear unconscious of a
      certain deepening colour in her own cheeks, pressed a hand on her shoulder, and whispering,
      'I'll see about it. Don't say any more, please,' glided out of the room.</p>
     <pb/>
     <p>'What's in the wind?' said Harry. 'Are many of your reefs out there, Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'Harry can talk nothing but sailors' language,' said Flora, 'and I am sure he did not learn
      that of Mr. Ernescliffe. You never hear slang from him.'</p>
     <p>'But aren't we going to Cocksmoor?' asked Mary, a blunt downright right girl of ten.</p>
     <p>'We shall know soon,' said Ethel. 'I suppose I had better wait till after the reading to
      mend that horrid frock?'</p>
     <p>'I think so, since we are so nearly collected,' said Miss Winter; and Ethel, seating herself
      on the corner of the window-seat, with one leg doubled under her, took up a Shakespeare,
      holding it close to her eyes, and her brother Norman, who, in age, came between her and Flora,
      kneeling on one knee on the window-seat, and supporting himself with one arm against the
      shutter, leant over her, reading it too, disregarding a tumultuous skirmish going on in that
      division of the family collectively termed 'the boys,' namely, Harry, Mary, and Tom, until Tom
      was suddenly pushed down, and tumbled over into Ethel's lap, thereby upsetting her and Norman
      together, and there was a general downfall, and a loud scream, 'The sphynx!'</p>
     <p>'You've crushed it,' cried Harry, dealing out thumps indiscriminately.</p>
     <p>'No, here 'tis,' said Mary, rushing among them, and bringing out a green sphynx caterpillar,
      on her finger—'tis not hurt.'</p>
     <p><hi>'Pax! Pax!</hi> ' cried Norman, over all, with the voice of an authority, as he leapt
      up lightly and set Tom on his legs again. 'Harry! you had better do that again,' he added,
      warningly. 'Be off, out of this window, and let Ethel and me read in peace.'</p>
     <p>'Here's the place,' said Ethel—'Crispin, Crispian's day. How I do like Henry V.'</p>
     <p>'It is no use to try to keep those boys in order!' sighed Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>'Saturnalia, as papa calls Saturday,' replied Flora.</p>
     <p>'Is not your eldest brother coming home to-day?' said Miss Winter, in a low voice to Flora,
      who shook her head, and said, confidentially, 'He is not coming till he has passed that
      examination. He thinks it better not.'</p>
     <p>Here entered, with a baby in her arms, a lady with a beautiful countenance of calm
      sweetness, looking almost too young to be the mother of the tall Margaret, who followed her.
      There was a general hush as she greeted Miss Winter, the girls crowding round to look at their
      little sister, not quite six weeks old.</p>
     <p>'Now, Margaret, will you take her up to the nursery?' said the mother, while the impatient
      speech was repeated, 'Mamma, can we go to Cocksmoor?'</p>
     <pb/>
     <p>'You don't think it will be too far for you?' said the mother to Miss Winter, as Margaret
      departed.</p>
     <p>'O no, not at all, thank you, that was not—But Margaret has explained.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, poor Margaret,' said Mrs. May, smiling. 'She has settled it by choosing to stay at
      home with me. It is no matter for the others, and he is going on Monday, so that it will not
      happen again.'</p>
     <p>'Margaret has behaved very well,' said Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>'She has indeed,' said her mother, smiling. 'Well, Harry, how is the caterpillar?'</p>
     <p>'They've just capsized it, mamma,' answered Harry, 'and Mary is making all taut.'</p>
     <p>Mrs. May laughed, and proceeded to advise Ethel and Norman to put away Henry V., and find
      the places in their Bibles, 'or you will have the things mixed together in your heads,' said
      she.</p>
     <p>In the meantime Margaret, with the little babe, to-morrow to be her godchild, lying gently
      in her arms, came out into the matted hall, and began to mount the broad shallow-stepped
      stair-case, protected by low stout balusters, with a very thick flat and solid mahogany
      hand-rail, polished by the boys' constant riding up and down upon it. She was only on the
      first step, when the dining-room door opened, and there came out a young man, slight, and
      delicate-looking, with bright blue eyes, and thickly-curling light hair. 'Acting nurse?' he
      said, smiling. 'What an odd little face it is! I didn't think little white babies were so
      pretty! Well, I shall always consider myself as the real godfather—the other is all a
      sham.</p>
     <p>'I think so,' said Margaret, 'but I must not stand with her in a draught,' and on she went,
      while he called after her. 'So we are to have an expedition to-day.'</p>
     <p>She did not gainsay it, but there was a little sigh of disappointment, and when she was out
      of hearing, she whispered, 'Oh! lucky baby, to have so many years to come before you are
      plagued with troublesome propriety!'</p>
     <p>Then depositing her little charge with the nurse, and trying to cheer up a solemn-looking
      boy of three, who evidently considered his deposition from babyhood as a great injury, she
      tripped lightly down again, to take part in the Saturday's reading and catechising.</p>
     <p>It was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of such teaching, the
      mother's gentle power preventing the outbreaks of restlessness to which even at such times the
      wild young spirits were liable. Margaret and Miss Winter especially rejoiced in it on this
      occasion, the first since the birth of the baby, that she had been able to preside. Under her,
      though seemingly without her taking any trouble, there was none of the smothered laughing at
      the little
      <pb/> ones' mistakes, the fidgetting of the boys, or Harry's audacious impertinence to Miss
      Winter; and no less glad was Harry to have his mother there, and be guarded from himself.</p>
     <p>The Catechism was repeated, and a comment on the Sunday Services read aloud. The Gospel was
      that on the taking the lowest place, and when they had finished, Ethel said, 'I like the verse
      which explains that: "They who now sit lowest here, When their Master shall appear, He shall
      bid them higher rise, And be highest in the skies." </p>
     <p>'I did not think of that being the meaning of "when He that bade thee cometh,"' said Norman,
      thoughtfully.</p>
     <p>'It seemed to be only our worldly advantage that was meant before,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Well, it means that too,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I suppose it does,' said Mrs. May; 'but the higher sense is the one chiefly to be dwelt on.
      It is a lesson how those least known and regarded here, and humblest in their own eyes, shall
      be the highest hereafter.'</p>
     <p>And Margaret looked earnestly at her mother, but did not speak.</p>
     <p>'May we go, mamma?' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Yes, you three—all of you, indeed, unless you wish to say any more.'</p>
     <p>The 'boys' availed themselves of the permission. Norman tarried to put his books into a neat
      leather case, and Ethel stood thinking. 'It means altogether—it is a lesson against ambition,'
      said she.</p>
     <p>'True,' said her mother, 'the love of eminence for its own sake.'</p>
     <p>'And in so many different ways!' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Aye, worldly greatness, riches, rank, beauty,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'All sorts of false flash and nonsense, and liking to be higher than one ought to be,' said
      Norman. 'I am sure there is nothing lower, or more mean and shabby, than getting places and
      praise a fellow does not deserve.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! yes!' cried Ethel, 'but no one fit to speak to would do that!'</p>
     <p>'Plenty of people do, I can tell you,' said Norman,</p>
     <p>'Then I hope I shall never know who they are!' exclaimed Ethel. 'But I'll tell you what I
      was thinking of, mamma. Caring to be clever, and get on, only for the sake of beating
      people.'</p>
     <p>'I think that might be better expressed.'</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Ethel, bending her brow, with the fulness of her thought—'I mean caring to do
      a thing only because nobody else can do it—wanting to be first more than wanting to do one's
      best.'</p>
     <p>'You are quite right, my dear Ethel,' said her mother; 'and I am glad you have found in the
      Gospel a practical lesson, that should be
      <pb/> useful to you both. I had rather you did so than that you read it in Greek, though that
      is very nice too,' she added, smiling, as she put her hand on a little Greek Testament, in
      which Ethel had been reading it, within her English Bible. 'Now, go and mend that deplorable
      frock, and if you don't dream over it, you won't waste too much of your holiday.'</p>
     <p>'I'll get it done in no time!' cried Ethel, rushing head-long upstairs, twice tripping in
      it, before she reached the attic, where she slept, as well as Flora and Mary—a large room in
      the roof, the windows gay with bird-cages and flowers, a canary singing loud enough to deafen
      any one but girls to whom headaches were unknown, plenty of books and treasures, and a very
      fine view, from the dormer-window, of the town sloping downwards, and the river winding away,
      with some heathy hills in the distance. Poking and peering about with her short-sighted eyes,
      Ethel lighted on a work-basket in rare disorder, pulled off her frock, threw on a shawl, and
      sat down cross-legged on her bed, stitching vigorously, while meantime she spouted with great
      emphasis an ode of Horace, which Norman having learnt, by heart, she had followed his example;
      it being her great desire to be even with him in all his studies, and though eleven months
      younger, she had never yet fallen behind him. On Saturday, he showed her what were his tasks
      for the week, and as soon as her rent was repaired, she swung herself down-stairs in search of
      him for this purpose. She found him in the drawing-room, a pretty pleasant room—its only fault
      that it was rather too low. It had windows opening down to the lawn, and was full of pretty
      things, works and knicknacks. Ethel found the state of affairs unfavourable to her. Norman was
      intent on a book on the sofa, and at the table sat Mr. Ernescliffe, hard at work with
      calculations and mathematical instruments. Ethel would not, for the world, that any one should
      guess at her classical studies—she scarcely liked to believe that even her father knew of
      them, and to mention them before Mr. Ernescliffe would have been dreadful. So she only shoved
      Norman, and asked him to come.</p>
     <p>'Presently,' he said.</p>
     <p>'What have you there?' said she, poking her head into the book. 'Oh! no wonder you can't
      leave off. I've been wanting you to read it all the week.'</p>
     <p>She read over him a few minutes, then recoiled: 'I forgot, mamma told me not to read those
      stories in the morning. Only five minutes, Norman.'</p>
     <p>'Wait a bit, I'll come.'</p>
     <p>She fidgetted, till Mr. Ernescliffe asked Norman if there was a table of logarithms in the
      house.</p>
     <pb/>
     <p>'O yes,' she answered; 'don't you know, Norman? In a brown book on the upper shelf in the
      dining-room. Don't you remember papa's telling us the meaning of them, when we had the grand
      book-dusting.'</p>
     <p>He was conscious of nothing but his book; however, she found the logarithms, and brought
      them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying to look at his drawing, and asking what he was making out. He
      replied, smiling at the impossibility of her understanding, but she wrinkled her brown
      forehead, hooked her long nose, and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.</p>
     <p>Market Stoneborough was a fine old town. The Minster, grand with the architecture of the
      time of Henry III., stood beside a broad river, and round it were the buildings of a Convent,
      made by a certain good Bishop Whichcote, the nucleus of a grammar school, which had survived
      the Reformation, and trained up many good scholars; among them, one of England's princely
      merchants, Nicholas Randall, whose effigy knelt in a niche in the Chancel wall,
      scarlet-cloaked, white-ruffed, and black doubletted, a desk bearing an open Bible before him,
      and a twisted pillar of Derbyshire spar on each side. He was the founder of thirteen
      almshouses, and had endowed two scholarships at Oxford, the object of ambition of the
      Stoneborough boys, every eighteen months.</p>
     <p>There were about sixty or seventy boarders, and the town boys slept at home, and spent their
      weekly holiday there on Saturday—the happiest day in the week to the May family, when alone,
      they had the company at dinner of Norman and Harry, otherwise known by their school names of
      June and July, given them because their elder brother had begun the series of months as
      May.</p>
     <p>Some two hundred years back, a Dr. Thomas May had been head master, but ever since that time
      there had always been an M.D., not a D.D., in the family, owning a comfortable demense of
      spacious garden, and field enough for two cows, still green and intact, among modern buildings
      and improvements.</p>
     <p>The present Dr. May stood very high in his profession, and might soon have made a large
      fortune in London, had he not held fast to his home attachments. He was extremely skilful and
      clever, with a boyish character that seemed as if it could never grow older; ardent,
      sensitive, and heedless, with a quickness of sympathy and tenderness of heart that was
      increased, rather than blunted, by exercise in scenes of suffering.</p>
     <p>At the end of the previous summer holidays, Dr. May had been called one morning to attend a
      gentleman who had been taken very ill, at the Swan Inn.</p>
     <p>He was received by a little boy of ten years old, in much grief,
      <pb/> explaining that his brother had come two days ago from London, to bring him to school
      here; he had seemed unwell ever since they met, and last night had become much worse. And
      extremely ill the Doctor found him; a youth of two or three-and-twenty, suffering under a
      severe attack of fever, oppressed, and scarcely conscious, so as quite to justify his little
      brother's apprehensions. He advised the boy to write to his family, but was answered by a look
      that went to his heart—'Alan' was all he had in the world—father and mother were dead, and
      their relations lived in Scotland, and were hardly known to them.</p>
     <p>'Where have you been living, then?'</p>
     <p>'Alan sent me to school at Miss Lawler's, when my mother died, and there I have been ever
      since, while he has been these three years and a half on the African station.'</p>
     <p>'What, is he in the navy?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said the boy, proudly, 'Lieutenant Ernescliffe. He got his promotion last week. My
      father was in the battle of Trafalgar; and Alan has been three years in the West Indies, and
      then he was in the Mediterranean, and now on the coast of Africa, in the Atalantis. You must
      have heard about him, for it was in the newspaper, how, when he was mate, he had the command
      of the Santa Isabel, the slaver they captured.'</p>
     <p>The boy would have gone on for ever, if Dr. May had not recalled him to his brother's
      present condition, and proceeded to take every measure for the welfare and comfort of the
      forlorn pair.</p>
     <p>He learnt from other sources that the Ernescliffes were well connected. The father had been
      a distinguished officer, but had been ill able to provide for his sons; indeed, he died,
      without ever having seen little Hector, who was born during his absence on a voyage— his last,
      and Alan's first. Alan, the elder by thirteen years, had been like a father to the little boy,
      showing judgment and selfdenial that marked him of a high cast of character. He had
      distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships, and in command of a prize that he had
      had to conduct to Sierra Leone, he had shown great coolness and seamanship, in several
      perilous conjunctures, such as a sudden storm, and an encounter with another slaver, when his
      Portuguese prisoners became mutinous, and nothing but his steadiness and intrepidity had saved
      the lives of himself and his few English companions. He was, in fact, as Dr. May reported,
      pretty much of a hero. He had not, at the time, felt the effects of the climate, but, owing to
      sickness and death among the other officers, he had suffered much fatigue, and pressure of
      mind and body. Immediately on his return, had followed his examination, and though he had
      passed with great credit, and it had been at once followed by
      <pb n="10"/> well-earned promotion, his nervous excitable frame had been over-tasked, and the
      consequence was a long and severe illness.</p>
     <p>The Swan inn was not forty yards from Dr. May's back gate, and, at every spare moment, he
      was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor, professionally obliged to Alan Ernescliffe for
      bringing him a curious exotic specimen of fever, and requiting him by the utmost care and
      attention, while, for their own sakes, he delighted in the two boys with all the enthusiasm of
      his warm heart. Before the first week was at an end, they had learnt to look on the Doctor as
      one of the kindest friends it had been their lot to meet with, and Alan knew that if he died,
      he should leave his little brother in the hands of one who would comfort him as a father.</p>
     <p>No sooner was young Ernescliffe able to sit up, than Dr. May insisted on conveying him to
      his own house, as his recovery was likely to be tedious, in solitude at the Swan. It was not
      till he had been drawn in a chair along the sloping garden, and placed on the sofa to rest,
      that he discovered that the time the good Doctor had chosen for bringing a helpless
      convalescent to his house, was two days after an eleventh child had been added to his
      family.</p>
     <p>Mrs. May was too sorry for the solitary youth, and too sympathizing with her husband, to
      make any objection, though she was not fond of strangers, and had some anxieties. She had the
      utmost dependence on Margaret's discretion, but there was a chance of awkward situations,
      which papa was not likely to see or guard against. However, all seemed to do very well, and no
      one ever came into her room without some degree of rapture about Mr. Ernescliffe. The Doctor
      reiterated praises of his excellence, his principle, his ability and talent, his amusing talk;
      the girls were always bringing reports of his perfections; Norman retracted his grumbling at
      having his evenings spoilt; and 'the boys' were bursting with the secret that he was teaching
      them to rig a little ship that was to astonish mamma on her first coming down stairs, and to
      be named after the baby; while Blanche did all the coquetry with him, from which Margaret
      abstained. The universal desire was for mamma to see him, and when the time came, she owned
      that papa's swan had not turned out a goose.</p>
     <p>There were now no grounds for prolonging his stay; but it was very hard to go, and he was
      glad to avail himself of the excuse of remaining for the Christening, when he was to represent
      the absent godfather. After that, he must go; he had written to his Scottish cousins to offer
      a visit, and he had a promise that he should soon be afloat again. No place would ever seem to
      him to like home as Market Stoneborough. He was quite like one of themselves, and took a full
      share in the discussions on the baby's name, which, as
      <pb n="11"/> all the old family appellations had been used up, was an open question. The
      Doctor protested against Alice and Edith, which he said were the universal names in the
      present day. The boys hissed every attempt of their sisters at a romantic name, and then Harry
      wanted it to be Atalantis! At last Dr. May announced that he should have her named Dowsabel if
      they did not agree, and Mrs. May advised all the parties concerned, to write their choice on a
      slip of paper, and little Aubrey should draw two out of her bag, trusting that Atalantis
      Dowsabel would not come out, as Harry confidently predicted.</p>
     <p>However, it was even worse, Aubrey's two lots were Gertrude and Margaret. Ethel and Mary
      made a vehement uproar to discover who could have written Margaret, and at last traced it home
      to Mr. Ernescliffe, who replied that Flora, without saying why, had desired him to set down
      his favourite name. He was much disconcerted, and did not materially mend the matter by saying
      it was the first name that came into his head.</p>

     <p>Ethel's navigation lesson was interrupted by the dinner-bell. That long table was a
      goodly sight. Few ever looked happier than Dr. and Mrs. May, as they sat opposite to each
      other, presenting a considerable contrast in appearance as in disposition. She was a little
      woman, with that smooth pleasant plumpness that seems to belong to perfect content and
      serenity, her complexion fair and youthful, her face and figure very pretty, and full of quiet
      grace and refinement, and her whole air and expression denoting a serene, unruffled,
      affectionate happiness, yet with much authority in her mildness—warm and open in her own
      family, but reserved beyond it, and shrinking from general society.</p>
     <p>The Doctor, on the contrary, had a lank, bony figure, nearly six feet high, and looking more
      so from his slightness; a face sallow, thin, and strongly marked, an aquiline nose, highly
      developed forehead, and peculiar temples, over which the hair strayed in thin curling flakes.
      His eyes were light-coloured, and were seldom seen without his near-sighted spectacles, but
      the expressions of the mouth were everything—so varying, so bright, and so sweet were the
      smiles that showed beautiful white teeth—moreover, his hand was particularly well made, small
      and delicate; and it always turned out that no one ever recollected that Dr. May was plain,
      who had ever heard his kindly greeting.</p>
     <pb n="12"/>
     <p>The sons and daughters were divided in likeness to father and mother; Ethel was almost an
      exaggeration of the Doctor's peculiarities, especially at the formed, but unsoftened age of
      fifteen; Norman had his long nose, sallow complexion, and tall figure, but was much improved
      by his mother's fine blue eyes, and was a very pleasant-looking boy, though not handsome;
      little Tom was a thin, white, delicate edition of his father; and Blanche contrived to combine
      great likeness to him with a great deal of prettiness. Of those that, as nurse said, favoured
      their mamma, Margaret was tall and blooming, with the same calm eyes, but with the brilliance
      of her father's smile; Flora had greater regularity of feature, and was fast becoming a very
      pretty girl, while Mary and Harry could not boast of much beauty, but were stout sturdy
      pictures of health; Harry's locks in masses of small tight yellow curls, much given to
      tangling and matting, unfit to be seen all the week, till nurse put him to torture every
      Saturday, by combing them out so as, at least, to make him for once, like, she said, a
      gentleman, instead of a young lion.</p>
     <p>Little Aubrey was said by his papa to be like nothing but the full moon. And there he shone
      on them, by his mamma's side, announcing in language few could understand, where he had been
      with papa.</p>
     <p>'He has been a small doctor,' said his father, beginning to cut the boiled beef as fast as
      if his hands had been moved by machinery. 'He has been with me to see old Mrs. Robins, and she
      made so much of him, that if I take you again you'll be regularly spoilt, young master.'</p>
     <p>'Poor old woman, it must have been a pleasure to her,' said Mrs. May—'it is so seldom she
      has any change.'</p>
     <p>'Who is she?' asked Mr. Ernescliffe.</p>
     <p>'The butcher's old mother,' said Margaret, who was next to him. 'She is one of papa's pet
      patients, because he thinks her desolate and ill-used.'</p>
     <p>'Her sons bully her,' said the doctor, too intent on carving to perceive certain deprecatory
      glances of caution cast at him by his wife, to remind him of the presence of man and maid—'and
      that smart daughter is worse still. She never comes to see the old lady but she throws her
      into an agitated state, fit to bring on another attack. A meek old soul, not fit to contend
      with them!'</p>
     <p>'Why do they do it?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'For the cause of all evil! That daughter marries a grazier, and wants to set up for
      gentility; she comes and squeezes presents out of her mother, and the whole family are
      distrusting each other, and squabbling over the spoil before the poor old creature is
      <pb n="13"/> dead! It makes one sick! I gave that Mrs. Thorn a bit of my mind at last; I could
      not stand the sight any longer. Madam, said I, you'll have to answer for your mother's death,
      as sure as my name's Dick May—a harpy dressed up in feathers and lace.'</p>
     <p>There was a great laugh, and an entreaty to know whether this was really his address—Ethel
      telling him she knew he had muttered it to himself quite audibly, for which she was rewarded
      by a pretended box on the ear. It certainly was vain to expect order at dinner on Saturday,
      for the Doctor was as bad as the boys, and Mrs. May took it with complete composure, hardly
      appearing sensible of the Babel which would sometimes almost deafen its promoter, papa; and
      yet her interference was all-powerful, as now when Harry and Mary were sparring over the salt,
      with one gentle 'Mary!' and one reproving glance, they were reduced to quiescence.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile Dr. May, in a voice above the tumult, was telling 'Maggie,' as he always called
      his wife, some piece of news about Mr. Rivers, who had bought Abbotstoke Grange; and Alan
      Ernescliffe, in much lower tones, saying to Margaret how he delighted in the sight of these
      home scenes, and this free household mirth.</p>
     <p>'It is the first time you have seen us in perfection,' said Margaret, 'with mamma at the
      head of the table—no, not quite perfection either, without Richard.'</p>
     <p>'I am very glad to have seen it,' repeated Alan. 'What a blessing it must be to your
      brothers to have such a home!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, indeed,' said Margaret, earnestly.</p>
     <p>'I cannot fancy any advantage in life equal to it. Your father and mother so entirely one
      with you all.'</p>
     <p>Margaret smiled, too much pleased to speak, and glanced at her mother's sweet face.</p>
     <p>'You can't think how often I shall remember it, or how rejoiced I—' He broke off, for the
      noise subsided, and his speech was not intended for the public ear, so he dashed into the
      general conversation, and catching his own name, exclaimed, 'What's that base proposal,
      Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'To put you on the donkey,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'They want to see a sailor riding,' interposed the doctor.</p>
     <p>'Dr. May! cried the indignant voice of Hector Ernescliffe, as his honest Scottish face
      flushed like a turkey cock, 'I assure you that Alan rides like—'</p>
     <p>'Like a horse marine,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>Hector and Harry both looked furious, but "June" was too great a man in their world, for
      them to attempt any revenge, and it was left for Mary to call out, 'Why, Norman, nonsense! Mr.
      Ernescliffe rode the new black kicking horse till he made it quite steady.'</p>
     <pb n="14"/>
     <p>'Made it steady! No, Mary, that is saying too much for it,' said Mr. Ernescliffe.</p>
     <p>'It has no harm in it—capital horse—splendid,' said the Doctor; 'I shall take you out with
      it this afternoon, Maggie.'</p>
     <p>'You have driven it several times?' said Alan.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I drove him to Abbotstoke yesterday—never started, except at a fool of a woman with an
      umbrella, and at the train—and we'll take care not to meet that.'</p>
     <p>'It is only to avoid the viaduct at half-past four,' said Mrs. May, 'and that is easily
      done.'</p>
     <p>'So you are bound for Cocksmoor?' said the Doctor. 'I told the poor fellow you were going to
      see his wife, and he was so thankful, that it did one's heart good.'</p>
     <p>'Is he better? I should like to tell his wife,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>The Doctor screwed up his face. 'A bad business,' he said; 'he is a shade better to-day; he
      may get through yet; but he is not my patient. I only saw him because I happened to be there
      when he was brought in, and Ward was not in the way.'</p>
     <p>'And what's his name?'</p>
     <p>'I can't tell—don't think I ever heard.'</p>
     <p>'We ought to know,' said Miss Winter; 'it would be awkward to go without.'</p>
     <p>'To go roaming about Cocksmoor asking where the man in the hospital lives!' said Flora. 'We
      can't wait till Monday.'</p>
     <p>'I've done,' said Norman; 'I'll run down to the hospital and find out. May I, mamma?'</p>
     <p>'Without your pudding, old fellow?'</p>
     <p>'I don't want pudding,' said Norman, slipping back his chair. 'May I, mamma?'</p>
     <p>'To be sure you may;' and Norman, with a hand on the back of Ethel's chair, took a flying
      leap over his own, that set all the glasses ringing.</p>
     <p>'Stop, stop! know what you are going after, sir,' cried his father. 'What will they know
      there of Cocksmoor, or the man whose wife has twins? You must ask for the accident in number
      five.'</p>
     <p>'And oh! Norman, come back in time,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I'll be bound I'm back before Etheldred the Unready wants me,' he answered, bounding off
      with an elasticity that caused his mother to say the boy was made of Indian rubber, and then
      putting his head in by the window to say, 'By-the-bye, if there's any pudding owing to me,
      that little chorister fellow of ours, Bill Blake, has got a lot of voracious brothers that
      want anything that's going. Tom and Blanche might take it down to 'em; I'm off! Hooray!' and
      he scampered headlong up the garden, prolonging his voice into
      <pb n="15"/> a tremendous shout as he got further off, leaving every one laughing, and his
      mother tenderly observing that he was going to run a quarter of a mile and back, and lose his
      only chance of pudding for the week—old Bishop Whichcote's rules contemplating no fare but
      daily mutton, to be bought at a shilling per sheep. A little private discussion ensued between
      Harry and Hector, on the merits of the cakes at Ballhatchet's gate, and old Nelly's pies,
      which led the doctor to mourn over the loss of the tarts of the cranberries, that sued to grow
      on Cocksmoor, before it was inhabited, and to be the delight of the scholars of Stoneborough,
      when he was one of them—and then to enchant the boys by relations of ancient exploits,
      especially his friend Spencer climbing up, and engraving a name on the top of the market
      cross, now no more, swept away by the Town Council in a fit of improvement, which had for the
      last twenty years enraged the Doctor at every remembrance of it. Perhaps at this moment his
      wife could hardly sympathize, when she thought of her boys emulating such deeds.</p>
     <p>'Papa,' said Ethel, 'will you lend me a pair of spectacles for the walk?'</p>
     <p>'And make yourself one, Ethel,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I don't care—I want to see the view.'</p>
     <p>'It is very bad for you, Ethel,' further added her mother; 'you will make your sight much
      shorter if you accustom your eyes to them.'</p>
     <p>'Well, mamma, I never do wear them about the house.</p>
     <p>'For a very good reason,' said Margaret; 'because you haven't got them.'</p>
     <p>'No, I believe Harry stole them in the holidays.'</p>
     <p>'Stole them!' said the Doctor; 'as if they weren't my property, unjustifiably appropriated
      by her!'</p>
     <p>'They were that pair that you never could keep on, papa,' said Ethel—no use at all to you.
      Come, do lend me some.'</p>
     <p>'I'm sure I shan't let you wear them,' said Harry. 'I shan't go, if you choose to make
      yourself such an object.'</p>
     <p>'Ah!' said the father, 'the boys thought it time to put a stop to it when it came to a
      caricature of the little Doctor in petticoats.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, in Norman's Lexicon,' said Ethel, 'a capital likeness of you, papa; but I never could
      get him to tell me who drew it.'</p>
     <p>Nor did Ethel know that that caricature had been the cause of the black eye that Harry had
      brought home last summer. Harry returned, to protest that he would not join the walk, if she
      chose to be seen in the spectacles, while she undauntedly continued her petition, though
      answered that she would attract the attacks of the quarry-men, who would take her for an
      attenuated owl.</p>
     <p>'I wish you were obliged to go about without them yourself,
      <pb n="16"/> papa!' cried Ethel, 'and then you would know how tiresome it is not to see twice
      the length of your own nose.'</p>
     <p>'Not such a very short allowance, either,' said the Doctor, quaintly, and therewith the
      dinner concluded: There was apt to be a race between the two eldest girls, for the honour of
      bringing down the baby; but this time their father strode up three steps at once, turned at
      the top of the first flight, made his bow to them, and presently came down with his little
      daughter in his arms, nodded triumphantly at the sisters, and set her down on her mother's
      lap.</p>
     <p>'There, Maggie, you are complete, you old hen-and-chicken daisy. Can't you take her portrait
      in the character, Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'With her pink cap, and Blanche and Aubrey as they are now, on each side?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Margaret ought to be in the picture herself,' said Ethel. 'Fetch the artist in Norman's
      Lexicon, Harry.'</p>
     <p>'Since he has hit off one of us so well,' said the doctor. 'Well! I'm off. I must see old
      Southern. You'll be ready by three? Good-bye, hen and chicken.'</p>
     <p>'And I may have the spectacles?' said Ethel, running after him; 'you know I am an injured
      individual, for mamma won't let me carry baby about the house, because I am so blind.'</p>
     <p>'You are welcome to embellish yourself, as far as I am concerned.'</p>
     <p>A general dispersion ensued, and only Mrs. May, Margaret, and the baby, remained.</p>
     <p>'O no!' sighed Margaret; 'you can't be the hen-and-chicken daisy properly, without all your
      chickens. It is the first christening we ever had without our all being there.'</p>
     <p>'It was best not to press it, my dear,' said her mother. 'Your papa would have had his
      thoughts turned to the disappointment again, and it makes Richard himself so unhappy to see
      his vexation, that I believe it is better not to renew it.'</p>
     <p>'But to miss him for so long!' said Margaret. 'Perhaps it is best, for it is very miserable,
      when papa is sarcastic and sharp, and he cannot understand it, and takes it as meaning so much
      mere than it really does, and grows all the more frightened and diffident. I cannot think what
      he would do without you to encourage him.'</p>
     <p>'Or you, you good sister,' said her mother, smiling. 'If we could only teach him not to mind
      being laughed at, and to have some confidence in himself, he and papa would get on
      together.'</p>
     <p>'It is very hard,' cried Margaret, almost indignantly, 'that papa won't believe it, when he
      does his best!'</p>
     <p>'I don't think papa can bear to bring himself to believe that it is his best.'</p>
     <pb n="17"/>
     <p>'He is too clever himself to see how other people can be slow,' said Margaret; 'and yet'—the
      tears came into her eyes—'I cannot bear to think of his telling Richard it was no use to think
      of being a Clergyman, and he had better turn carpenter at once, just because he failed in his
      examination.'</p>
     <p>'My dear, I wish you would forget that,' said Mrs. May. 'You know papa sometimes says more
      than he means, and he was excessively vexed and disappointed. I know he was pleased with
      Ritchie's resolve not to come home again till he had passed, and it is best that it should not
      be broken.'</p>
     <p>'The whole vacation, studying so hard, and this Christening!' said Margaret; 'it is treating
      him as if he had done wrong. I do believe Mr. Ernescliffe thinks he has—for papa always turns
      away the conversation, if his name is mentioned! I wish you would explain it, mamma; I can't
      bear <hi>that</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'If I can,' said Mrs. May, rather pleased that Margaret had not taken on herself this
      vindication of her favourite brother at her father's expense. 'But, after all, Margaret, I
      never feel quite sure that poor Ritchie does exert himself to the utmost; he is too desponding
      to make the most of himself.'</p>
     <p>'And the more vexed papa is, the worse it grows!' said Margaret. 'It is provoking, though.
      How I do wish sometimes to give Ritchie a jog, when there is some stumbling-block that he
      sticks fast at. Don't you remember those sums, and those declensions? When he is so clear and
      sensible about practical matters too—anything but learning—I cannot think why—and it is very
      mortifying!'</p>
     <p>'I dare say it is very good for us not to have our ambition gratified,' said her mother.
      'There are so many troubles worse than these failures, that it only shows how happy we are
      that we should take them so much to heart.'</p>
     <p>'They are a very real trouble!' said Margaret. 'Don't smile, mamma. Only remember how
      wretched his school days were, when papa could not see any difficulty in what to him was so
      hard, and how all papa's eagerness only stupified him the more.'</p>
     <p>'They are a comfort not to have that over again! Yet,' said the mother, 'I often think there
      is more fear for Norman. I dread his talent and success being snares.'</p>
     <p>'There is no self-sufficiency about him,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I hope not, and he is so transparent, that it would be laughed down at the first bud; but
      the universal good report, and certainty of success, and being so often put in comparison with
      Richard, is hardly safe. I was very glad he heard what Ethel said to-day.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel spoke very deeply,' said Margaret; 'I was a good deal struck by it—she often comes
      out with such solid thoughts.'</p>
     <pb n="18"/>
     <p>'She is an excellent companion for Norman.'</p>
     <p>'The desire of being first!' said Margaret, 'I suppose that is a form of caring for oneself!
      It set me thinking a good deal, mamma, how many forms of ambition there are. The craving for
      rank, or wealth, or beauty, are so clearly wrong, that one does not question about them; but I
      suppose, as Ethel said, the caring to be first in attainments is as bad.'</p>
     <p>'Or in affection,' said Mrs. May.</p>
     <p>'In affection—oh! mamma, there is always some one person with whom one is first,' said
      Margaret, eagerly; and then, her colour deepening, as she saw her mother looking at her, she
      said hastily, 'Ritchie—I never considered it—but I know—it is my great pleasure —oh,
      mamma!'</p>
     <p>'Well, my dear, I do not say but that you are the first with Richard, and that you well
      deserve to be so; but is the seeking to be the first even in that way safe? Is it not
      self-seeking again?'</p>
     <p>'Well, perhaps, it is. I know it is what makes jealousy.'</p>
     <p>'The only plan is not to think about ourselves at all,' said Mrs. May. 'Affection is round
      us like sunshine, and there is no use in measuring and comparing. We must give it out freely
      ourselves, hoping for nothing again.'</p>
     <p>'O, mamma, you don't mean that!'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps I should have said, bargaining for nothing again. It will come of itself, if we
      don't exact it; but rivalry is the sure means of driving it away, because that is trying to
      get oneself worshipped.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose, then, you have never thought of it,' said Margaret, smiling.</p>
     <p>'Why, it would have been rather absurd,' said Mrs. May, laughing, 'to begin to torment
      myself, whether you were all fond of me! you all have just as much affection for me, from
      beginning to end, as is natural, and what's the use of thinking about it? No, no, Margaret,
      don't go and protest that you love me, more than is natural,' as Margaret looked inclined to
      say something very eager, 'that would be in the style of Regan and Goneril. It will be natural
      by-and-by that you should, some of you, love some one else better, and if I cared for being
      first, what should I do then?'</p>
     <p>'O, mamma!—But,' said Margaret, suddenly, 'you are always sure of papa.'</p>
     <p>'In one way, yes,' said Mrs. May; 'but how do I know how long—' Calm as she was, she could
      not finish that sentence. 'No, Margaret, depend upon it, the only security is, not to think
      about ourselves at all, and not to fix our mind on any affection on earth. The least share of
      the Love above, is the fulness of all blessing,
      <pb n="19"/> and if we seek that first, all these things will be added unto us, and are,' she
      whispered more to herself than to Margaret.</p>

     <p>'Is this all the walking party?' exclaimed Mr. Ernescliffe, as Miss Winter, Flora,
      and Norman gathered in the hall.</p>
     <p>'Harry won't go because of Ethel's spectacles,' answered Flora; 'and Mary and he are
      inseparable, so they are gone with Hector to have a shipwreck in the field.'</p>
     <p>'And your other sisters?'</p>
     <p>'Margaret has ratted—she is going to drive out with mamma,' said Norman; 'as to Etheldred
      the Unready, I'll run up and hurry her.'</p>
     <p>In a moment he was at her door. 'Oh! Norman, come in. Is it time?'</p>
     <p>'I should think so! You're keeping every one waiting.'</p>
     <p>'Oh dear! go on; only just tell me the past participle of <hi>offero</hi> , and I'll catch
      you up.'</p>
     <p><hi>'Oblatus</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'O, yes, how stupid. The <hi>a</hi> long or short? Then that's right. I had such a line in
      my head, I was forced to write it down. Is not it a capital subject this time?'</p>
     <p>'The devotion of Decius? Capital. Let me see?' said Norman, taking up a paper scribbled in
      pencil, with Latin verses. 'O, you have taken up quite a different line from mine. I began
      with Mount Vesuvius spouting lava like anything.'</p>
     <p>'But Mount Vesuvius didn't <hi>spout</hi> till it overthrew Pompeii.'</p>
     <p>'Murder!' cried Norman, I forgot! It's lucky you put me in mind. I must make a fresh
      beginning. There go my six best lines! However, it was an uncanny place, fit for hob-goblins,
      and shades, and funny customers, which will do as well for my purpose. Ha! that's grand about
      its being so much better than the ' <hi>vana gloria triumphalis</hi> —only take care of the
      scanning there—'</p>
     <pb n="20"/>
     <p>'If it was but English. Something like this:— For what is equal to the fame Of forgetting
      self in the aim? That's not right, but—'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, Norman, what are you about?' cried Flora. 'Do you mean to go to Cocksmoor
      to-day?'</p>
     <p>'Oh yes!' cried Ethel, flying into vehement activity; 'only I've lost my blue-edged
      handkerchief—Flora, have you seen it?'</p>
     <p>'No; but here is your red scarf.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, there is a good Flora. And oh! I finished a frock all but two stitches. Where is
      it gone? Go on, all of you, I'll overtake you— Purer than breath of earthly fame, Is losing
      self in a glorious aim. Is that better, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'You'll drive us out of patience,' said Flora, tying the handkerchief round Ethel's throat,
      and pulling out the fingers of her gloves, which of course were inside out; 'are you
      ready?'</p>
     <p>'Oh, my frock! my frock! There 'tis—three stitches—go on, and I'll come,' said Ethel,
      seizing a needle, and sewing vehemently at a little pink frock. 'Go on, Miss Winter goes
      slowly up the hill, and I'll overtake you.'</p>
     <p>'Come, Norman, then; it is the only way to make her come at all.'</p>
     <p>'I shall wait for her,' said Norman. 'Go on, Flora, we shall catch you up in no time;' and,
      as Flora went, he continued, 'Never mind your aims and fames and trumpery English rhymes. Your
      verses will be much the best, Ethel; I only went on a little about Mount Vesuvius and the
      landscape, as Alan described it the other day, and Decius taking a last look, knowing he was
      to die. I made him beg his horse's pardon, and say how they will both be remembered, and their
      self-devotion would inspire Romans to all posterity, and shout with a noble voice!' said
      Norman, repeating some of his lines, correcting them as he proceeded.</p>
     <p>'Oh! yes; but oh! dear, I've done. Come along,' said Ethel, crumpling her work into a
      bundle, and snatching up her gloves— then, as they ran down stairs, and emerged into the
      street, 'it is a famous subject.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, you have made a capital beginning. If you won't break down somewhere, as you always
      do, with some frightful false quantity, that you would get an imposition for, if you were a
      boy. I wish you were. I should like to see old Hoxton's face, if you were to show him up some
      of these verses.'</p>
     <p>'I'll tell you what, Norman, if I was you, I would not make
      <pb n="21"/> Decius flatter himself with the fame he was to get—it is too like the stuff every
      one talks in stupid books. I want him to say— Rome—my country—the eagles—must win, if they
      do—never mind what becomes of me.'</p>
     <p>'But why should he not like to get the credit of it, as he did? Fame and glory—they are the
      spirit of life, the reward of such a death.'</p>
     <p>'O no, no,' said Ethel. 'Fame is coarse and vulgar—blinder than ever they draw Love or
      Fortune—she is only a personified newspaper, trumpeting out all that is extraordinary, without
      minding whether it is good or bad. She misses the delicate and lovely—I wished they would give
      us a theme to write about her. I should like to abuse her well.'</p>
     <p>'It would make a very good theme, in a new line,' said Norman; 'but I don't give into it,
      altogether. It is the hope and the thought of fame, that has made men great, from first to
      last. It is in every one that is not good for nothing, and always will be! The moving spirit
      of man's greatness!'</p>
     <p>'I'm not sure,' said Ethel; 'I think looking for fame is like wanting a reward at once. I
      had rather people forgot themselves. Do you think Arnold von Winkelried thought about fame,
      when he threw himself on the spears?'</p>
     <p>'He got it,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Yes; he got it for the good of other people, not to please himself. Fame does those that
      admire it good, not those that win it.'</p>
     <p>'But!' said Norman, and both were silent for some short interval, as they left the last
      buildings of the town, and began to mount a steep hill. Presently Norman slackened his space,
      and driving his stick vehemently against a stone, exclaimed, 'It is no use talking, Ethel, it
      is all a fight and a race. One is always to try to be foremost. That's the spirit of the
      things—that's what the great, from first to last, have struggled, and fought, and lived, and
      died for.</p>
     <p>'I know it is a battle, I know it is a race. The Bible says so replied Ethel; 'but is not
      there the difference, that here all may win—not only one? One may do one's best, not care
      whether one is first or last. That's what our reading to-day said.'</p>
     <p>'That was against trumpery vanity—false elevation—not what one has earned for oneself, but
      getting into other people's places that one never deserved. That every one despises!'</p>
     <p>'Of course! That they do. I say, Norman, didn't you mean Harvey Anderson?'</p>
     <p>Instead of answering, Norman exclaimed, 'It is pretension that is hateful—true excelling is
      what one's life is for. No, no, I'll never
      <pb n="22"/> be beat, Ethel—I never have been beat by any one, except by you, when you take
      pains,' he added, looking exultingly at his sister, 'and I never will be.'</p>
     <p>'O Norman!'</p>
     <p>'I mean, of course, while I have senses. I would not be like Richard for all the world.'</p>
     <p>'O no, no, poor Richard!'</p>
     <p>'He is an excellent fellow in everything else,' said Norman; 'I could sometimes wish I was
      more like him—but how he can be so amazingly slow, I can't imagine. That examination paper he
      broke down in—I could have done it as easily as possible.'</p>
     <p>'I did it all but one question,' said Ethel, 'but so did he, you know, and we can't tell
      whether we should have it done well enough.'</p>
     <p>'I know I must do something respectable when first I go to Oxford, if I don't with to be
      known as the man whose brother was plucked,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel; 'if papa will but let you try for the Randall scholarship next year, but
      he says it is not good to go to Oxford so young.'</p>
     <p>'And I believe I had better not be there with Richard,' added Norman. 'I don't like coming
      into contrast with him, and I don't think he can like it, poor fellow, and it isn't his fault.
      I had rather stay another year here, get one of the open scholarships, and leave the
      Stoneborough ones for those who can do no better.'</p>
     <p>In justice to Norman, we must observe that this was by no means said as a boast. He would
      scarcely have thus spoken to any one but Etheldred, to whom, as well as to himself, it seemed
      mere matter-of-fact. The others had in the meantime halted at the top of the hill, and were
      looking back at the town—the great old Minster, raising its twin towers and long roof, close
      to the river, where rich green meadows spread over the valley, and the town rising irregularly
      on the slope above, plentifully interspersed with trees and gardens, and one green space on
      the banks of the river, speckled over with a flock of little black dots in rapid motion.</p>
     <p>'Here you are!' exclaimed Flora. 'I told them it was of no use to wait when you and Norman
      had begun a dissertation.'</p>
     <p>'Now, Mr. Ernescliffe, I should like you to say,' cried Ethel, 'which do you think is the
      best, the name of it, or the thing?' Her eloquence always broke down with any auditor but her
      brother, or, perhaps, Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Ethell' said Norman, 'how is any one to understand you? The argument is this: Ethel wants
      people to do great deeds, and be
      <pb n="23"/> utterly careless of the fame of them; I say, that love of glory is a mighty
      spring.'</p>
     <p>'A mighty one!' said Alan; 'but I think, as far as I understand the question, that Ethel has
      the best of it.'</p>
     <p>'I don't mean that people should not serve the cause first of all,' said Norman, 'but let
      them have their right place and due honour.'</p>
     <p>'They had better make up their minds to do without it,' said Alan. 'Remember "The world
      knows nothing of its greatest men." </p>
     <p>'Then it is a great shame,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'But do you think it right,' said Ethel, 'to care for distinction? It is a great thing to
      earn it, but I don't think one should care for the outer glory.'</p>
     <p>'I believe it is a great temptation,' said Alan. 'The being over elated or over depressed by
      success or failure in the eyes of the world, independently of the exertion we have used—'</p>
     <p>'You call it a temptation?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Decidedly so.'</p>
     <p>'But one can't live or get on without it,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>There they were cut short. There was a plantation to be crossed, with a gate that would not
      open, and that seemed an effectual barrier against both Miss Winter and the donkey, until by
      persuasive eloquence and great gallantry, Mr. Ernescliffe performed the wonderful feat of
      getting the former over the tall fence, while Norman conducted the donkey a long way round,
      undertaking to meet them at the other side of the plantation.</p>
     <p>The talk became desultory, as they proceeded for at least a mile along a cart-track, through
      soft tufted grass and heath, and young fir trees. It ended in a broad open moor, stony and
      full of damp boggy hollows, forlorn and desolate under the autumn sky. Here they met Norman
      again, and walked on along a very rough and dirty road, the ground growing more decidedly into
      hills and valleys as they advanced, till they found themselves before a small, but very steep
      hillock, one side of which was cut away into a slate quarry. Round this stood a colony of
      roughly-built huts, of mud, turf, or large blocks of the slate. Many workmen were engaged in
      splitting up the slates, or loading waggons with them, rude wild-looking men, at the sight of
      whom the ladies shrank up to their protectors, but who seemed too busy even to spare time for
      staring at them.</p>
     <p>They were directed to John Taylor's house, a low mud cottage, very wretched looking, and
      apparently so smoky, that Mr. Ernescliffe and Norman were glad to remain outside and survey
      the quarry, while the ladies entered.</p>
     <p>Inside they found more cleanliness and neatness than they had
      <pb n="24"/> expected, but there was a sad appearance of poverty, insufficient furniture, and
      the cups and broken tea-pot on the table, holding nothing but toast and water, as a substitute
      for their proper contents. The poor woman was sitting by the fire with one twin on her lap,
      and the other on a chair by her side, and a larger child was in the corner by the fire,
      looking heavy and ill, while others of different ages lounged about listlessly. She was not
      untidy, but very pale, and she spoke in a meek, subdued way, as if the ills of life were so
      heavy on her that she had no spirit even to complain. She thanked them for their gifts but
      languidly, and did not visibly brighten when told that her husband was better.</p>
     <p>Flora asked when the babes would be Christened.</p>
     <p>'I can't hardly tell, Miss—'tis so far to go.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose none of the children can go to school. I don't know their faces there,' said
      Flora, looking at a nice tall, smooth-haired girl, of thirteen or fourteen.</p>
     <p>'No, Miss—'tis so far. I am sorry they should not, for they always was used to it where we
      lived before, and my oldest girl, she can work very nicely. I wish I could get a little place
      for her.'</p>
     <p>'You would hardly know what to do without her,' said Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>'No, ma'am; but she wants better food than I can give her, and it is a bad wild place for a
      girl to grow up. It is not like what I was used to, ma'am; I was always used to keep to my
      school and to my Church—but it is a bad place to live in here.'</p>
     <p>No one could deny it, and the party left the cottage gravely. Alan and Norman joined them,
      having heard a grievous history of the lawlessness of the people, from a foreman with whom
      they had met. There seemed to be no visible means of improvement. The parish Church was
      Stoneborough, and there the living was very poor, the tithes having been appropriated to the
      old Monastery, and since its dissolution having fallen into possession of a Body that never
      did anything for the town. The incumbent, Mr. Ramsden, had small means, and was not a high
      stamp of Clergyman, seldom exerting himself, and leaving most of his parish work to the two
      under masters of the school, Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Harrison, who did all they had time and
      strength for, and more too, within the town itself. There was no hope for Cocksmoor!</p>
     <p>'There would be a worthy ambition!' said Etheldred, as they turned their steps homeward.
      'Let us propose that aim to ourselves, to build a Church on Cocksmoor!'</p>
     <p>'How many years do you give us to do it in?' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Few or many, I don't care. I'll never leave off thinking about it till it is done.'</p>
     <pb n="25"/>
     <p>'It need not be long,' said Flora, 'if one could get up a subscription.'</p>
     <p>'A penny subscription?' said Norman. 'I'd rather have it my own doing.'</p>
     <p>'You agree then,' said Ethel, 'do you, Mr. Ernescliffe?'</p>
     <p>'I may safely do so,' he answered, smiling.</p>
     <p>Miss Winter looked at Etheldred reprovingly, and she shrank into herself, drew apart, and
      indulged in a reverie. She had heard in books, of girls writing poetry, romance,
      history—gaining fifties and hundreds. Could not some of the myriads of fancies floating in her
      mind thus be made available? She would compose, publish, earn money—some day call papa, show
      him her hoard, beg him to take it, and, never owning whence it came, raise the building. Spire
      and chancel—pinnacle and buttress rose before her eyes—and she and Norman were standing in the
      porch, with an orderly, religious population, blessing the unknown benefactor, who had caused
      the news of salvation to be heard among them.</p>
     <p>They were almost at home, when the sight of a crowd in the main street checked them. Norman
      and Mr. Ernescliffe went forward to discover the cause, and spoke to some one on the
      outskirts—then Mr. Ernescliffe hurried back to the ladies. 'There's been an accident,' he
      said, hastily—'you had better go down the lane, and in by the garden.'</p>
     <p>He was gone in an instant, and they obeyed in silence. Whence came Ethel's certainty that
      the accident concerned themselves? In an agony of apprehension, though without one outward
      sign of it, she walked home. They were in the garden—all was apparently as usual, but no one
      was in sight. Ethel had been first, but she held back, and let Miss Winter go forward into the
      house. The front door was open—servants were standing about in confusion, and one of the
      maids, looking dreadfully frightened, gave a cry, 'Oh! Miss— Miss—have you heard?'</p>
     <p>'No—what? What has happened? Not Mrs. May—' exclaimed Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>'Oh! ma'am! it is all of them. The carriage is over-turned, and—'</p>
     <p>'Who's hurt? Mamma! papa! Oh! tell me!' cried Flora.</p>
     <p>'There's nurse,' and Ethel flew up to her. 'What is it? Oh! nurse!</p>
     <p>'My poor, poor children,' said old nurse, passionately kissing Ethel. Harry and Mary were on
      the stairs behind her, clinging together.</p>
     <p>A stranger looked into the house, followed by Adams, the stableman. 'They are going to bring
      Miss May in,' some one said.</p>
     <p>Ethel could bear it no longer. As if she could escape, she fled up-stairs, into her room,
      and, falling on her knees, hid her face on her bed.</p>
     <pb n="26"/>
     <p>There were heavy steps in the house, then a sound of hasty feet coming up to her. Norman
      dashed into the room, and threw himself on a chair. He was ghastly pale, and shuddered all
      over.</p>
     <p>'Oh! Norman, Norman, speak. What is it?'</p>
     <p>He groaned, but could not speak; he rested his head against her, and gasped. She was
      terribly frightened. 'I'll call—' and she would have gone, but he held her. 'No—no—thye
      can't!' He was prevented from saying more, by chattering teeth and deadly faintness. She tried
      to support him, but could only guide him as he sank, till he lay at full length on the floor,
      where she put a pillow under his head, and gave him some water. 'Is it—oh! tell me. Are they
      much hurt? Oh, try to say.'</p>
     <p>'They say Margaret is alive,' said Norman, in gasps; 'but— And papa—he stood
      up—sat—walked—was better—'</p>
     <p>'Is he hurt—much hurt?'</p>
     <p>'His arm—' and the tremor and fainting stopped him again.</p>
     <p>'Mamma?' whispered Ethel; but Norman only pressed his face into the pillow.</p>
     <p>She was so bewildered as to be more alive to the present distress of his condition, than to
      the vague horrors down-stairs. Some minutes passed in silence, Norman lying still, excepting a
      nervous trembling that agitated his whole frame. Again was heard the strange tread, doors
      opening and shutting, and suppressed voices, and he turned his face upwards, and listened with
      his hand pressed to his forehead, as if to keep himself still enough to listen.</p>
     <p>'Oh! what is the matter? What is it?' cried Ethel, startled and recalled to the sense of
      what was passing. 'Oh! Norman!' then springing up, with a sudden thought, 'Mr. Ward! Oh! is he
      there?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman, in a low hopeless tone, 'he was at the place. He said it—'</p>
     <p>'What?'</p>
     <p>Again Norman's face was out of sight.</p>
     <p>'Mamma?' Ethel's understanding perceived, but her mind refused to grasp the extent of the
      calamity. There was no answer, save a convulsive squeezing of her hand.</p>
     <p>Fresh sounds below recalled her to speech and action. 'Where is she? What are they doing for
      her? What—'</p>
     <p>'There's nothing to be done. She—when they lifted her up, she was—'</p>
     <p>'Dead?'</p>
     <p>'Dead.'</p>
     <p>The boy lay with his face hidden, the girl sat by him on the floor, too much crushed for
      even the sensations belonging to grief, neither
      <pb n="27"/> moving nor looking. After an interval Norman spoke again, 'The carriage turned
      right over—her head struck on the kerb stone—'</p>
     <p>'Did you see?' said Ethel, presently.</p>
     <p>'I saw them lift her up.' He spoke at intervals, as he could get breath, and bear to utter
      the words. 'And papa—he was stunned—but soon he sat up, said he would go to her—he looked at
      her—felt her pulse, and then—sank down over her!'</p>
     <p>'And did you say, I can't remember—was he hurt?'</p>
     <p>The shuddering came again, 'His arm—all twisted—broken,' and his voice sank into a faint
      whisper; Ethel was obliged to sprinkle him again with water. 'But he won't die?' said she, in
      a tone calm from its bewilderment.</p>
     <p>'Oh! no, no, no—'</p>
     <p>'And Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'They were bringing her home. I'll go and see. Oh! what's the meaning of this?' exclaimed
      he, scolding himself, as, sitting up, he was forced to rest his head on his shaking hand.</p>
     <p>'You are still faint, dear Norman; you had better lie still, and I'll go and see.'</p>
     <p>'Faint—stuff—how horridly stupid!' but he was obliged to lay his head down again; and Ethel,
      scarcely less trembling, crept carefully towards the stairs, but a dread of what she might
      meet came over her, and she turned towards the nursery.</p>
     <p>The younger ones sat there in a frightened huddle. Mary was on a low chair by the infant's
      cot, Blanche in her lap, Tom and Harry leaning against her, and Aubrey almost asleep. Mary
      held up her finger as Ethel entered, and whispered, 'Hush! don't wake baby for anything!'</p>
     <p>The first true pang of grief shot through Ethel like a dart, stabbing and taking away her
      breath, 'Where are they?' she said; 'how is papa? who is with him?'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ward and Alan Ernescliffe,' said Harry. 'Nurse came up just now, and said they were
      setting his arm.'</p>
     <p>'Where is he?'</p>
     <p>'On the bed in his dressing-room,' said Harry.</p>
     <p>'Has he come to himself—is he better?'</p>
     <p>They did not seem to know, and Ethel asked where to find Flora. 'With Margaret,' she was
      told, and she was thinking whether she could venture to seek her, when she herself came fast
      up the stairs. Ethel and Harry both darted out. 'Don't stop me,' said Flora—'they want some
      handkerchiefs.'</p>
     <p>'What, is not she in her own room?'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Harry, 'in mamma's;' and then his face quivered all over, and he turned away.
      Ethel ran after her sister, and pulling
      <pb n="28"/> out drawers without knowing what she sought, begged to hear how papa and Margaret
      were.</p>
     <p>'We can't judge of Margaret—she has moved, and made a little moaning—there are no limbs
      broken, but we are afraid for her head. Oh! if papa could but—'</p>
     <p>'And papa?'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ward is with him now—his arm is terribly hurt.'</p>
     <p>'But oh! Flora—one moment—is he sensible?'</p>
     <p>'Hardly; he does not take any notice—but don't keep me.'</p>
     <p>'Can I do anything?' following her to the head of the stairs.</p>
     <p>'No; I don't see what you can do. Miss Winter and I are with Margaret; there's nothing to do
      for her.'</p>
     <p>It was a relief. Etheldred shrank from what she might have to behold, and Flora hastened
      down, too busy and too useful to have time to think. Harry had gone back to his refuge in the
      nursery, and Ethel returned to Norman. There they remained for a long time, both unwilling to
      speak or stir, or even to observe to each other on the noises that came in to them, as their
      door was left ajar, though in those sounds they were so absorbed, that they did not notice the
      cold of a frosty October evening, or the darkness that closed in on them.</p>
     <p>They heard the poor babe crying, one of the children going down to call nurse, and nurse
      coming up; then Harry, at the door of the room where the boys slept, calling Norman in a low
      voice. Norman, now nearly recovered, went and brought him into his sister's room, and his
      tidings were, that their father's arm had been broken in two places, and the elbow frightfully
      injured, having been crushed and twisted by the wheel. He was also a good deal bruised, and
      though Mr. Ward trusted there was no positive harm to the head, he was in an unconscious
      state, from which the severe pain of the operation had only roused him, so far as to evince a
      few signs of suffering. Margaret was still insensible.</p>
     <p>The piteous sound of the baby's wailing almost broke their hearts. Norman walked about the
      room in the dark, and said he should go down, he could not bear it; but he could not make up
      his mind to go, and after about a quarter of an hour, to their great relief, it ceased.</p>
     <p>Next Mary opened the door, saying, 'Norman, here's Mr. Wilmot come to ask if he can do
      anything—Miss Winter sent word that you had better go to him.'</p>
     <p>'How is baby?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'Nurse has fed her, and is putting her to bed; she is quiet now,' said Mary; 'will you go
      down, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'Where is he?'</p>
     <pb n="29"/>
     <p>'In the drawing-room.'</p>
     <p>Norman paused to ask what he was to say. 'Nothing,' said Mary, 'nobody can do anything. Make
      haste. Don't you want a candle?'</p>
     <p>'No, thank you, I had rather be in the dark. Come up as soon as you have seen him,' said
      Etheldred.</p>
     <p>Norman went slowly down, with failing knees, hardly able to conquer the shudder that came
      over him, as he passed those rooms. There were voices in the drawing-room, and he found a sort
      of council there, Alan Ernescliffe, the surgeon, and Mr. Wilmot. They turned as he came in,
      and Mr. Wilmot held out his hand with a look of affection and kindness that went to his heart,
      making room for him on the sofa, while going on with what he was saying. 'Then you think it
      would be better for me not to sit up with him.'</p>
     <p>'I should decidedly say so,' replied Mr. Ward. 'He has recognised Mr. Ernescliffe, and any
      change might excite him, and lead him to ask questions. The moment of his full consciousness
      is especially to be dreaded.'</p>
     <p>'But you do not call him insensible?'</p>
     <p>'No, but he seems stunned—stupified by the shock, and by pain. He spoke to Miss Flora when
      she brought him some tea.'</p>
     <p>'And admirably she managed,' said Alan Ernescliffe. 'I was much afraid of some answer that
      would rouse him, but she kept her self-possession beautifully, and seemed to compose him in a
      moment.'</p>
     <p>'She is valuable indeed—so much judgment and activity,' said Mr. Ward. 'I don't know what we
      should have done without her. But we ought to have Mr. Richard—has no one sent to him?'</p>
     <p>Alan Ernescliffe and Norman looked at each other.</p>
     <p>'Is he at Oxford, or at his tutor's?' asked Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>'At Oxford; he was to be there to-day, was he not, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'What o'clock is it? Is the post gone—seven—no; it is all safe,' said Mr. Ward.</p>
     <p>Poor Norman! he knew he was the one who ought to write, but his icy trembling hand seemed to
      shake more helplessly than ever, and a piteous glance fell upon Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>'The best plan would be,' said Mr. Wilmot, 'for me to go to him at once, and bring him home.
      If I go by the mail-train, I shall get to him sooner than a letter could.'</p>
     <p>'And it will be better for him,' said Mr. Ward. 'He will feel it dreadfully, poor boy. But
      we shall all do better when we have him. You can get back to-morrow evening.'</p>
     <p>'Sunday,' said Mr. Wilmot, 'I believe there is a train at four.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! thank you, sir,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Since that is settled, perhaps I had better go up to the Doctor,'
      <pb n="30"/> said Alan; 'I don't like leaving Flora alone with him,' and he was gone.</p>
     <p>'How fortunate that that youth is here,' said Mr. Wilmot—'he seems to be quite taking
      Richard's place.'</p>
     <p>'And to feel it as much,' said Mr. Ward. 'He has been invaluable with his sailor's resources
      and handiness.'</p>
     <p>'Well, what shall I tell poor Richard?' asked Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>'Tell him there is no reason his father should not do very well, if we can keep him from
      agitation—but there's the point. He is of so excitable a constitution, that his faculties
      being so far confused, is the best thing, perhaps, that could be. Mr. Ernescliffe manages him
      very well—used to illness on that African coast, and the Doctor is very fond of him. As to
      Miss May, one can't tell what to say about her yet—there's no fracture, at least—it must be a
      work of time to judge.'</p>
     <p>Flora at that moment half-opened the door, and called Mr. Ward, stopping for a moment to say
      it was for nothing of any consequence. Mr. Wilmot and Norman were left together. Norman put
      his hands over his face and groaned—his master looked at him with kind anxiety, but did not
      feel as if it were yet time to speak of consolation.</p>
     <p>'God bless and support you, and turn this to your good, my dear boy,' said he
      affectionately, as he pressed his hand; 'I hope to bring your brother to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, sir,' was all Norman could say; and as Mr. Wilmot went out by the front door, he
      slowly went up again, and lingering on the landing-place, was met by Mr. Ward, who told him to
      his relief—for the mere thinking of it renewed the faint sensation—that he had better not go
      to his father's room.</p>
     <p>There was nothing to be done but to return to Ethel and Harry, and tell them all; with some
      humiliation at being helpless, where Flora was doing so much, and to leave their father to be
      watched by a stranger. If he had been wanted, Norman might have made the effort, but being
      told that he would be worse than useless, there was nothing for him but to give way.</p>
     <p>They sat together in Ethel's room, till somewhere between eight and nine o'clock, when good
      old nurse, having put her younger ones to bed, came in search of them. 'Dear, dear! poor
      darlings,' said she, as she found them sitting in the dark; she felt their cold hands, and
      made them all come into the nursery, where Mary was already, and, fondling them, one by one,
      as they passively obeyed her, she set them down on their little old stools round the fire,
      took away the high fender, and gave them each a cup of tea. Harry and Mary ate enough to
      satisfy her, from a weary craving feeling, and for want of
      <pb n="31"/> employment; Norman sat with his elbow on his knee, and a very aching head resting
      on his hand, glad of drink, but unable to eat; Ethel could be persuaded to do neither, till
      she found old nurse would let her have no peace.</p>
     <p>The nurse sent them all to bed, taking the two girls to their own room, undressing them, and
      never leaving them until Mary was in a fair way of crying herself to sleep—for saying her
      prayers had brought the tears; while Ethel lay so wide awake that it was of no use to wait for
      her, and then she went to the boys, tucked them each in, as when they were little children,
      and saying, 'Bless your dear hearts!' bestowed on each of them a kiss which came gratefully to
      Norman's burning brow, and which even Harry's boyish manliness could not resist.</p>
     <p>Flora was in Margaret's room, too useful to be spared.</p>
     <p>So ended that dreadful Saturday.</p>

     <p>Such a strange sad Sunday! No going to Church, but all the poor children moving in
      awe and oppression about the house, speaking under their breath, as they gathered in the
      drawing-room. Into the study, they might not go, and when Blanche would have asked why, Tom
      pressed her hand and shuddered.</p>
     <p>Etheldred was allowed to come and look at Margaret, and even to sit in the room for a little
      while, to take the place of Miss Winter; but she was not sensible of sufficient usefulness to
      relieve the burden of fear and bewilderment in the presence of that still, pale form; and,
      what was almost worse, the sight of the familiar objects, the chair by the fire, the sofa, the
      books, the work-basket, the letter-case, the dressing things, all these were too oppressive.
      She sat crouched up, with her face hidden in her hands, and the instant she was released,
      hastened back to Norman. She was to tell him that he might go into the room, but he did not
      move, and Mary alone went in and out with message.</p>
     <p>Dr. May was not to be visited, for he was in the same half-conscious state, apparently
      sensible only of bodily suffering, though
      <pb n="32"/> he answered when addressed, and no one was trusted to speak to him but Flora and
      Alan Ernescliffe.</p>
     <p>The rest wore through the day as best they might. Harry slept a good deal, Ethel read to
      herself, and tried to get Norman to look at passages which she liked, Mary kept the little
      ones from being troublesome, and at last took them to peep behind the school-room blinds for
      Richard's coming.</p>
     <p>There was a simultaneous shout when, at four o'clock, they caught sight of him, and though,
      at Ethel's exclamation of wonder, Mary and Tom hung their heads at having forgotten
      themselves, the association of gladness in seeing Richard was refreshing; the sense of being
      desolate and forsaken was relieved, and they knew that now they had one to rely on and to
      comfort them.</p>
     <p>Harry hastened to open the front-door, and Richard, with his small trim figure, and fresh,
      fair young face, flushed, though not otherwise agitated, was among them, almost devoured by
      the younger ones, and dealing out quiet caresses to them, as he caught from the words and
      looks of the others, that at least his father and sister were no worse. Mr. Wilmot had come
      with him, but only staid to hear the tidings.</p>
     <p>'Can I see papa?' were Richard's first audible words—all the rest had been almost dumb
      show.</p>
     <p>Ethel thought not, but took him to Margaret's room, where he stood for many minutes without
      speaking; then whispered to Flora that he must go to the others, she should call him if—and
      went down, followed by Ethel.</p>
     <p>Tom and Blanche had fallen into teazing tricks, a sort of melancholy play to relieve the
      tedium. They grew cross. Norman was roused to reprove sharply, and Blanche was beginning to
      cry. But Richard's entrance set all at peace—he sat down among them, and, with soft voice and
      arm round Blanche, as she leaned against him, made her good in a moment; and she listened
      while he talked over with Norman and Ethel all they could bear to speak of.</p>
     <p>Late in the day, Flora came into her father's room, and stood gazing at him, as he lay with
      eyes closed, breathing heavily, and his brows contracted by pain. She watched him with piteous
      looks, as if imploring him to return to his children. Poor girl, to-day's quiet, after the
      last evening's bustle, was hard to bear. She had then been distracted from thought by the
      necessity of exertion, but it now repayed itself, and she knew not how to submit to do nothing
      but wait and watch.</p>
     <p>'No change?' enquired Alan Ernescliffe; looking kindly in her face.</p>
     <p>'No,' replied she in a low, mournful tone. 'She only once said, thank you.'</p>
     <pb n="33"/>
     <p>A voice which she did not expect, asked inquiringly, 'Margaret?' and her heart beat as if it
      would take away her breath, as she saw her father's eyes intently fixed on her. 'Did you speak
      of her?' he repeated.</p>
     <p>'Yes, dear papa,' said Flora, not losing presence of mind, though in extreme fear of what
      the next question might be. 'She is quiet and comfortable, so don't be uneasy, pray.'</p>
     <p>'Let me hear,' he said, and his whole voice and air showed him to be entirely roused. 'There
      is injury? What is it—'</p>
     <p>He continued his inquiries till Flora was obliged fully to explain her sister's condition,
      and then he dismayed her by saying he would get up and go to see her. Much distressed, she
      begged him not to think of it, and appealed to Alan, who added his entreaties that he would at
      least wait for Mr. Ward; but the Doctor would not relinquish his purpose, and sent her to give
      notice that he was coming.</p>
     <p>Mr. Ernescliffe followed her out of the room, and tried to console her, as she looked at him
      in despair.</p>
     <p>'You see he is quite himself, quite collected,' he said; 'you heard how clear and coherent
      his questions were.'</p>
     <p>'Can't it be helped? Do try to stop him till I can send to Mr. Ward.'</p>
     <p>'I will try, but I think he is in a state to judge for himself. I do, upon my word; and I
      believe trying to prevent him would be more likely to do him harm than letting him satisfy
      himself. I really think you need not be alarmed.'</p>
     <p>'But you know,' said Flora, coming nearer, and almost gasping as she whispered and signed
      towards the door, 'she is there—it is mamma's room, that will tell all.'</p>
     <p>'I believe he knows,' said Alan. 'It was <hi>that</hi> which made him faint after the
      accident, for he had his perceptions fully at first. I have suspected all day that he was more
      himself than he seemed, but I think he could not bear to awaken his mind to understand it, and
      that he was afraid to hear about her—your sister, so that our mention of her was a great
      relief, and did him good. I am convinced he knows the rest. Only go on, be calm, as you have
      been, and we shall do very well.'</p>
     <p>Flora went to prepare. Ethel eagerly undertook to send to Mr. Ward, and hastened from the
      room, as if in a sort of terror, shrinking perhaps from what might lead to an outburst of
      grief. She longed to <hi>have</hi> seen her father, but was frightened at the chance of
      meeting him. When she had sent her message, and told her brothers what was passing, she went
      and lingered on the stairs and in the passage for tidings. After what seemed a long time,
      Flora came out, and hastened to the nursery, giving her intelligence on the way.</p>
     <pb n="34"/>
     <p>'Better than could be hoped, he walked alone into the room, and was quite calm and composed.
      Oh! if this will not hurt him, if the seeing baby was but over!'</p>
     <p>'Does he want her?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, he would have come up here himself, but I would not let him—Nurse, do you hear? Papa
      wants baby, let me have her.'</p>
     <p>'Bless me, Miss Flora, you can't hold her while you are all of a tremble! And he has been to
      Miss Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, nurse, and he was only rather stiff and lame.'</p>
     <p>'Did Margaret seem to know him?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'She just answered in that dreamy way when he spoke to her. He says he thinks it is as Mr.
      Ward believes, and that she will soon come to herself. He is quite able to consider—'</p>
     <p>'And he knows all?'</p>
     <p>'I am sure he does. He desired to see baby, and he wants you, nurse. Only mind you command
      yourself—don't say a word you can help—do nothing to agitate him.'</p>
     <p>Nurse promised, but the tears came so fast, and sobs with them, as she approached her
      master's room, that Flora saw no composure could be expected from her; and taking the infant
      from her, carried it in, leaving the door open for her to follow when wanted. Ethel stood by
      listening. There was silence at first, then some sounds from the baby, and her father's voice
      soothing it, in his wonted caressing phrases and tones, so familiar that they seemed to break
      the spell, drive away her vague terrors, and restore her father. Her heart bounded, and a
      sudden impulse carried her to the bedside, at once forgetting all dread of seeing him, and
      chance of doing him harm. He lay, holding the babe close to him, and his face was not altered,
      so that there was nothing in the sight to impress her with the need of caution, and, to the
      consternation of the anxious Flora, she exclaimed, abruptly and vehemently, 'Papa! should not
      she be Christened?'</p>
     <p>Dr. May looked up at Ethel, then at the infant; 'Yes,' he said, 'at once.' Then added feebly
      and languidly, 'Some one must see to it.'</p>
     <p>There was a pause, while Flora looked reproachfully at her sister, and Ethel became
      conscious of her imprudence, but in a few moments Dr. May spoke again, first to the baby, and
      then asking, 'Is Richard here?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa.'</p>
     <p>'Send him up presently. Where's nurse?'</p>
     <p>Ethel retreated, much alarmed at her rash measure, and when she related it, she saw that
      Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe both thought it had been a great hazard.</p>
     <pb n="35"/>
     <p>'Papa wants you,' was a welcome sound to the ears of Richard, and brought a pink glow into
      his face. He was never one who readily showed his feelings, and there was no danger of his
      failing in self-command, though grievously down-cast, not only at the loss of the tender
      mother, who had always stood between him and his father's impatience, but by the dread that he
      was too dull and insignificant to afford any help or comfort in his father's dire
      affliction.</p>
     <p>Yet there was something in the gentle sad look that met him, and in the low tone of the 'How
      d'ye do, Ritchie?' that drove off all thought of not being loved; and when Dr. May further
      added, 'You'll see about it all—I am glad you are come,' he knew he was of use, and was
      encouraged and cheered. That his father had full confidence and reliance in him, and that his
      presence was a satisfaction and relief, he could no longer doubt; and this was a drop of balm
      beyond all his hopes; for loving and admiring his father intensely, and with depressed spirits
      and a low estimate of himself, he had begun to fancy himself incapable of being anything but a
      vexation and burthen.</p>
     <p>He sat with his father nearly all the evening, and was to remain with him at night. The rest
      were comforted by the assurance that Dr. May was still calm, and did not seem to have been
      injured by what had passed. Indeed, it seemed as if the violence and suddenness of the shock,
      together with his state of suffering, had deadened his sensations; for there was far less
      agitation about him than could have been thought possible in a man of such strong, warm
      affections and sensitive temperament.</p>
     <p>Ethel and Norman went up arm-in-arm at bed-time.</p>
     <p>'I am going to ask if I may wish papa good night,' said Ethel. 'Shall I say anything about
      your coming?'</p>
     <p>Norman hesitated, but his cheeks blanched; he shuddered, shook his head without speaking,
      ran up after Harry, and waved her back when she would have followed.</p>
     <p>Richard told her that she might come in, and, as she slowly advanced, she thought she had
      never seen anything so ineffably mournful as the affectionate look on her father's face. She
      held his hand and ventured—for it was with difficulty she spoke—to hope he was not in
      pain.</p>
     <p>'Better than it was, thank you, my dear,' he said, in a soft weak tone; then, as she bent
      down to kiss his brow, 'You must take care of the little ones.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa,' she could hardly answer, and a large drop gathered slowly in each eye, long in
      coming, as if the heart ached too much for them to flow freely.</p>
     <p>'Are they all well?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa.'</p>
     <pb n="36"/>
     <p>'And good?' He held her hand, as if lengthening the interview.</p>
     <p>'Yes, very good all day.'</p>
     <p>A long deep sigh. Ethel's two tears stood on her cheeks.</p>
     <p>'My love to them all. I hope I shall see them to morrow. God bless you, my dear, good
      night.'</p>
     <p>Ethel went up-stairs, saddened and yet soothed. The calm silent sorrow, too deep for outward
      tokens, was so unlike her father's usually demonstrative habits, as to impress her all the
      more, yet those two tears were followed by no more; there was much strangeness and confusion
      in her mind in the newness of grief.</p>
     <p>She found poor Flora, spent with exertion, under the reaction of all she had undergone,
      lying on her bed, sobbing as if her heart would break, calling in gasps of irrepressible agony
      on mamma! mamma! yet with her face pressed down on the pillow that she might not be heard.
      Ethel, terrified and distressed, timidly implored her to be comforted, but it seemed as if she
      were not even heard; she would have fetched some one, but whom? Alas! alas! it brought back
      the sense that no mother would ever soothe them—Margaret, papa, both so ill, nurse engaged
      with Margaret! Ethel stood helpless and despairing, and Flora sobbed on, so that Mary awakened
      to burst out in a loud frightened fit of crying; but in a few moments a step was at the door,
      a knock, and Richard asked, 'Is anything the matter?'</p>
     <p>He was in the room in a moment, caressing and saying affectionate things with gentleness and
      fondling care, like his mother, and which recalled the days when he had been proud to be left
      for a little while the small nurse and guardian of the lesser ones. Mary was hushed in a
      moment, and Flora's exhausted weeping was gradually soothed, when she was able to recollect
      that she was keeping him from her father; with kind good nights, he left Ethel to read to her
      till she could sleep. Long did Ethel read, after both her sisters were slumbering soundly; she
      went on in a sort of dreamy grief, almost devoid of pain, as if all this was too terrible to
      be true; and she had imagined herself into a story, which would give place at dawn to her
      ordinary life.</p>
     <p>At last she went to bed, and slept till wakened by the return of Flora, who had crept down
      in her dressing-grown to see how matters were going. Margaret was in the same state, papa was
      asleep, after a restless distressing night, with much pain and some fever; and whenever
      Richard had begun to hope from his tranquillity, that he was falling asleep, he was undeceived
      by hearing an almost unconsciously uttered sigh of 'Maggie, my Maggie!' and then the head
      turned wearily on the pillow, as if worn out with the misery from which there was no escape.
      Towards morning, the pain had lessened,
      <pb n="37"/> and, as he slept, he seemed much less feverish than they could have ventured to
      expect.</p>
     <p>Norman looked man and wretched, and could taste no breakfast; indeed Hary reported that he
      had been starting and talking in his sleep half the night, and had proceeded to groaning and
      crying out till, when it could be borne no longer, Harry waked him, and finished his night's
      rest in peace.</p>
     <p>The children were kept in the drawing room that morning, and there were strange steps in the
      house; but only Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe knew the reason. Happily there had been witnesses
      enough of the overturn to spare any reference to Dr. May—the violent start of the horses had
      been seen, and Adams and Mr. Ernescliffe agreed, under their breath, that the new black one
      was not fit to drive, while the whole town was so used to Dr. May's headlong driving, that
      every one was recollecting their own predictions of accidents. There needed little to account
      for the disaster—the only wonder was, that it had not happened sooner.</p>
     <p>'I say,' announced Harry, soon after they were released again, 'I've been in to papa. His
      door was open, and he heard me, and called me. He says he should like any of us to come in and
      see him. Hadn't you better go, Norman?'</p>
     <p>Norman started up, and walked hastily out of the room, but his hand shook so, that he could
      hardly open the door; and Ethel, seeing how it was with him, followed him quickly, as he
      dashed, at full speed, up the stairs. At the top, however, he was forced to cling to the rail,
      gasping for breath, while the moisture started on his forehead.</p>
     <p>'Dear Norman,' she said, 'there's nothing to mind. He looks just as usual. You would not
      know there was anything the matter.' But he rested his head on his hand, and looked as if he
      could not stir. 'I see it won't do,' said Ethel—'don't try—you will be better by-and-by, and
      he has not asked for you in particular.'</p>
     <p>'I won't be beat by such stuff,' said Norman, stepping hastily forwards, and opening the
      door suddenly. He got through the greeting pretty well, there was no need for him to speak, he
      only gave his hand and looked away, unable to bring himself to turn his eyes on his father,
      and afraid of letting his own face be seen. Almost at the same moment, nurse came to say
      something about Margaret, and he seized the opportunity of withdrawing his hand, and hurrying
      away, in good time, for he was pale as death, and was obliged to sit down on the head of the
      stairs, and lean his head against Etheldred.</p>
     <p>'What does make me so ridiculous?' he exclaimed faintly, but very indignantly.</p>
     <pb n="38"/>
     <p>The first cure was the being forced to clear out of Mr. Ward's way, which he could not
      effect without being seen; and Ethel, though she knew that he would be annoyed, was not sorry
      to be obliged to remain, and tell what was the matter with him. 'Oh,' said Mr. Ward, turning
      and proceeding to the dining-room, 'I'll set that to rights in a minute, if you will ask for a
      tumbler of hotwater, Miss Ethel.'</p>
     <p>And armed with the cordial he had prepared, Ethel hunted up her brother, and persuaded him,
      after scolding her a little, to swallow it, and take a turn in the garden; after which he made
      a more successful attempt at visiting his father.</p>
     <p>There was another room whither both Norman and Etheldred wished to go, though they dared not
      hint at their desire. At last, Richard came to them, as they were wandering in the garden,
      and, with his usual stillness of manner, shaded with additional seriousness, said, 'Would you
      like to come into the study?'</p>
     <p>Etheldred put one hand into his, Norman took the other, and soon they stood in that calm
      presence. Fair, cold, white, and intensely still—that face brought home to them the full
      certainty that the warm brightening look would never beam on them, the soft blue eyes never
      guide, check, and watch them, the smile never approve or welcome them. To see her unconscious
      of their presence was too strange and sad, and all were silent, till, as they left the room,
      Ethel looked out at Blanche and Aubrey in the garden. 'They will never remember her! Oh! why
      should it be?'</p>
     <p>Richard would fain have moralized and comforted, but she felt as if she knew it all before,
      and heard with languid attention. She had rather read than talk, and he sat down to write
      letters.</p>
     <p>There were no near relations to be sent for. Dr. May was an only son, and his wife's sister,
      Mrs. Arnott, was in New Zealand; her brother had long been dead, and his widow, who lived in
      Edinburgh, was scarcely known to the May family. Of friends there were many, fast bound by
      affection and gratitude, and notes, inquiries, condolences, and offers of service came in
      thickly, and gave much occupation to Flora, Richard, and Alan Ernescliffe, in turn. No one
      from without could do anything for them—they had all the help they wanted in Miss Winter and
      in Alan, who was invaluable in sharing with Richard the care of the Doctor, as well as in
      giving him the benefit of his few additional years' experience, and relieving him of some of
      his tasks. He was indeed like one of themselves, and a most valuable help and comforter. Mr.
      Wilmot gave them all the time he could, and on this day saw the Doctor, who seemed to find
      some solace in his visit, though saying very little.</p>
     <p>On this day the baby was to be baptized. The usual Stoneborough
      <pb n="39"/> fashion was to collect all the Christenings for the month into one Sunday, except
      those for such persons as thought themselves too refined to see their children Christened
      before the congregation, and who preferred an empty Church and a week-day. The little one had
      waited till she was nearly six weeks old for 'a Christening Sunday,' and since that had been
      missed, she could not be kept unbaptized for another month; so, late in the day, she was
      carried to Church.</p>
     <p>Richard had extremely gratified old nurse, by asking her to represent poor Margaret, Mrs.
      Hoxton stood for the other godmother, and Alan Ernescliffe was desired to consider himself
      absolutely her sponsor, not merely a proxy. The younger children alone were to go with them:
      it was too far off, and the way lay too much through the town for it to be thought proper for
      the others to go. Ethel wished it very much, and thought it nonsense to care whether people
      looked at her; and in spite of Miss Winter's seeming shocked at her proposing it, had a great
      mind to persist. She would even have appealed to her papa, if Flora had not stopped her,
      exclaiming, 'Really, Ethel, I think there never was a person so entirely without consideration
      as you are.'</p>
     <p>Much abashed, Ethel humbly promised that if she might go into papa's room, she would not say
      one word about the Christening, unless he should begin, and, to her great satisfaction, he
      presently asked her to read the service to him. Flora came to the door-way of Margaret's room,
      and listened; when she had finished, all were silent.</p>
     <p>'How shall we, how can we virtuously bring up our motherless little sister?' was the thought
      with each of the girls. The answers were, in one mind, 'I trust we shall do well by her, dear
      little thing. I see, on an emergency, that I know how to act. I never thought I was capable of
      being of so much use, thanks to dear, dear mamma's training. I shall manage, I am sure, and so
      they will all depend on me, and look up to me. How nice it was to hear dear papa say what he
      did about the comfort of my being able to look after Margaret.'</p>
     <p>In the other, 'Poor darling, it is saddest of all for her, because she knows nothing, and
      will never remember her mamma! But if Margaret is but better, she will take care of her, and
      oh! how we ought to try—and I, such a naughty wild thing—if I should hurt the dear little ones
      by carelessness, or by my bad example! Oh! what shall I do, for want of some one to keep me in
      order? If I should vex papa by any of my wrong ways!'</p>
     <p>They heard the return of the others, and the sisters both sprang up, 'May we bring her to
      you?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Yes, do, my dears.'</p>
     <pb n="40"/>
     <p>The sisters all came down together with the little one, and Flora put her down within the
      arm her father stretched out for her. He gazed into the baby face, which, in its
      expressionless placidity, almost recalled her mother's tranquil sweetness.</p>
     <p>'Gertrude Margaret,' said Flora, and with a look that had more of tenderness than grief, he
      murmured, 'My Daisy blossom, my little Maggie.'</p>
     <p>'Might we?' said Ethel, when Flora took her again, 'might we take her to her godmother to
      see if she would notice her?'</p>
     <p>He looked as if he wished it; but said, 'No, I think not, better not rouse her,' and sighed
      heavily; then, as they stood round his bed, unwilling to go, he added 'Girls, we must learn
      carefulness and thoughtfulness. We have no one to take thought for us now.'</p>
     <p>Flora pressed the babe in her arms, Ethel's two reluctant tears stood on her cheeks, Mary
      exclaimed, 'I'll try not to be naughty;' and Blanche climbed up to kiss him, saying, 'I will
      be always good, papa.'</p>
     <p>'Daisy—papa's Daisy—your vows are made,' whispered Ethel, gaining sole possession of the
      babe for a minute. 'You have promised to be good and holy. We have the keeping of you, mamma's
      precious flower, her pearl of truth! Oh, may God guard you to be an unstained jewel, till you
      come back to her again—and a blooming flower, till you are gathered into the wreath that never
      fades—my own sweet poor little motherless Daisy!'</p>

     <p>Dr. May took the management of himself into his own hands, and paid so little
      attention to Mr. Ward's recommendations, that his sons and daughters were in continual dread
      of his choosing to do something that might cause injurious agitation.</p>
     <p>However, he did not attempt to go farther than Margaret's bedside, where he sat hour after
      hour, his eyes fixed upon her, as she continued in a state bordering on insensibility. He took
      little notice of anything else, and hardly spoke. There were heavy sighs now and then, but
      Richard and Flora, one or other of whom were
      <pb n="41"/> always watching him, could hardly tell whether to ascribe them to the oppression
      of sorrow, or of suffering. Their great fear was of his insisting on seeing his wife's face,
      and it was a great relief that he never alluded to her, except once, to desire Richard to
      bring him her ring. Richard silently obeyed, and, without a word, he placed it on his little
      finger. Richard used to read the Psalms to him in the morning, before he was up, and Flora
      would bring little Daisy and lay her by his side.</p>
     <p>To the last moment, they dreaded his choosing to attend the funeral, and Flora had decided
      on remaining at home, though trembling at the thought of what there might be to go through.
      They tried to let him hear nothing about it, but he seemed to know every thing; and when Flora
      came into Margaret's room, without her bonnet, he raised his head, and said, 'I thought you
      were all going.'</p>
     <p>'The others are—but may I not stay with you and her, papa?'</p>
     <p>'I had rather be alone, my dear. I will take care of her. I should wish you all to be
      there.'</p>
     <p>They decided that his wishes ought to be followed, and that the patients must be entrusted
      to old nurse. Richard told Flora, who looked very pale, that she would be glad of it
      afterwards, and she had his arm to lean upon.</p>
     <p>The grave was in the cloister attached to the Minster, a smooth green square of turf, marked
      here and there with small flat lozenges of stone, bearing the date and initials of those who
      lay there, and many of them recording former generations of Mays, to whom their descent from
      the head-master had given a right of burial there. Dr. Hoxton, Mr. Wilmot, and the surgeon,
      were the only friends whom Richard had asked to be with them, but the Minster was nearly full,
      for there was a very strong attachment and respect for Dr. and Mrs. May throughout the
      neighbourhood, and every one's feelings were strongly excited.</p>
     <p>'In the midst of life, we are in death—' There was a universal sound, as of a sort of sob,
      that Etheldred never disconnected from those words. Yet hardly one tear was shed by the young
      things who stood as close as they could round the grave. Harry and Mary did indeed lock their
      hands together tightly, and the shoulders of the former shook as he stood, bowing down his
      head, but the others were still and quiet, in part from awe and bewilderment, but partly, too,
      from a sense that it was against her whole nature that there should be clamorous mourning for
      her. The calm still day seemed to tell them the same, the sun beaming softly on the grey
      arches and fresh grass, the sky clear and blue, and the trees that shewed over the walls
      bright with autumn colouring, all suitable to the serenity of a life unclouded to its last
      moment. Some of them felt
      <pb n="42"/> as if it were better to be there, than in their saddened desolate home.</p>
     <p>But home they must go, and, before going up-stairs, as Flora and Etheldred stood a moment or
      two with Norman, Ethel said in a tone of resolution, and of some cheerfulness, 'Well, we have
      to begin afresh.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Flora, 'it is a great responsibility. I do trust we may be enabled to do as we
      ought.'</p>
     <p>'And now Margaret is getting better, she will be our stay,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I must go to her,' and Flora went up-stairs.</p>
     <p>'I wish I could be as useful as Flora,' said Ethel, 'but I mean to try, and if I can but
      keep out of mischief, it will be something.'</p>
     <p>'There is an object for all one does, in trying to be a comfort to papa.'</p>
     <p>'That's no use,' said Norman, listlessly. 'We never can.'</p>
     <p>'O but, Norman, he won't be always as he is now—I am sure he cares for us enough to be
      pleased, if we do right and get on.'</p>
     <p>'We used to be so happy!' said Norman.</p>
     <p>Ethel hesitated a little, and presently answered, 'I don't think it can be right to lament
      for our own sakes so much, is it?'</p>
     <p>'I don't want to do so,' said Norman, in the same dejected way.</p>
     <p>'I suppose we ought not to feel it either.' Norman only shook his head. 'We ought to think
      of her gain. You can't? Well, I am glad, for no more can I. I can't think of her liking for
      papa and baby and all of us to be left to ourselves. But that's not right of me, and of course
      it all comes right where she is; so I always put that out of my head, and think what is to
      come next in doing, and pleasing papa, and learning.'</p>
     <p>'That's grown horrid,' said Norman. 'There's no pleasure in getting on, nor in
      anything.'</p>
     <p>'Don't you care for papa and all of us being glad, Norman?'</p>
     <p>As Norman could not just then say that he did, he would not answer.</p>
     <p>'I wish—' said Ethel, disappointed, but cheering up the next minute. 'I do believe it is
      having nothing to do. You will be better when you get back to school on Monday.'</p>
     <p>'That is worst of all!'</p>
     <p>'You don't like going among the boys again? But that must be done some time or other. Or
      shall I get Richard to speak to Dr. Hoxton to let you have another week's leave?'</p>
     <p>'No, no, don't be foolish. It can't be helped.'</p>
     <p>'I am very sorry, but I think you will be better for it.'</p>
     <p>She almost began to fancy herself unfeeling, when she found him so much more depressed than
      she was herself, and unable to feel it a relief to know that the time of rest, and want of
      occupation was
      <pb n="43"/> over. She thought it light-minded, though she could not help it, to look forward
      to the daily studies where she might lose her sad thoughts, and be as if everything were as
      usual. But suppose she should be to blame, where would now be the gentle discipline? Poor
      Ethel's feelings were not such as to deserve the imputation of levity, when this thought came
      over her; but her buoyant mind, always seeking for consolation, recurred to Margaret's
      improvement, and she fixed her hopes on her.</p>
     <p>Margaret was more alive to surrounding objects, and, when roused, she knew them all,
      answered clearly when addressed, had even, more than once, spoken of her own accord, and shewn
      solicitude at the sight of her father's bandaged, helpless arm, but he soon soothed this away.
      He was more than ever watchful over her, and could scarcely be persuaded to leave her for one
      moment, in his anxiety to be at hand to answer, when first she should speak of her mother, a
      moment apprehended by all the rest, almost as much for his sake as for hers.</p>
     <p>So clear had her perceptions been, and so much more awake did she appear, on this evening,
      that he expected the enquiry to come every moment, and lingered in her room; till she asked
      the hour, and begged him to go to bed.</p>
     <p>As he bent over her, she looked up in his face, and said, softly, 'Dear papa.'</p>
     <p>There was that in her tone which showed she perceived the truth, and he knelt by her side
      kissing her, but not daring to relax his restraint of feeling.</p>
     <p>'Dear papa,' she said again, 'I hope I shall soon be better, and be some comfort to
      you.'</p>
     <p>'My best—my own—my comfort,' he murmured, all he could say without giving way.</p>
     <p>'Baby—is she well?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, thank Heaven, she has not suffered at all.'</p>
     <p>'I heard her this morning, I must see her to-morrow. But don't stay, dear, dear papa, it is
      late, and I am sure you are not at all well. Your arm—is it very much hurt?'</p>
     <p>'It is nothing you need think about, my dear. I am much better than I could have imagined
      possible.'</p>
     <p>'And you have been nursing me all the time! Papa, you must let me take care of you now. Do
      pray go to bed at once, and get up late. Nurse will take good care of me. Good night, dear
      papa.'</p>
     <p>When Dr. May had left her, and tried to tell Richard how it had been, the tears cut him
      short, and had their free course; but there was much of thankfulness, for it might be looked
      on as the restoration of his daughter; the worst was over, and the next day he was
      <pb n="44"/> able to think of other things, had more attention to spare for the rest, and when
      the surgeon came, took some professional interest in the condition of his own arm, inquired
      after his patients, and even talked of visiting them.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, Margaret sent for her eldest brother, begging him to tell her the whole,
      and it was heard as calmly and firmly as it was told. Her bodily state lulled her mind; and
      besides it was not new; she had observed much while her faculties were still too much benumbed
      for her to understand all, or to express her feelings. Her thoughts seemed chiefly occupied
      with her father. She made Richard explain to her the injury he had suffered, and begged to
      know whether his constant attendance on her, could do him harm. She was much rejoiced when her
      brother assured her that nothing could be better for him and she began to say with a smile,
      that very likely her being hurt had been fortunate. She asked who had taken care of him before
      Richard's arrival, and was pleased to hear that it was Mr. Ernescliffe. A visit from the
      little Gertrude Margaret was happily accomplished, and, on the whole, the day was most
      satisfactory—she herself declaring that she could not see that there was anything the matter
      with her, except that she felt lazy, and did not seem able to move.</p>
     <p>Thus the next Sunday morning dawned with more cheerfulness. Dr. May came down stairs for the
      first time, in order to go to Church with his whole flock, except the two Margarets. He looked
      very wan and shattered, but they clustered gladly round him, when he once more stood among
      them, little Blanche securing his hand, and nodding triumphantly to Mr. Ernescliffe, as much
      as to say, 'Now I have him, I don't want you.'</p>
     <p>Norman alone was missing; but he was in his place at Church among the boys. Again in
      returning, he slipped out of the party, and was at home the first, and when this recurred in
      the afternoon, Ethel began to understand his motive. The High-street led past the spot where
      the accident had taken place, though neither she nor any of the others knew exactly where it
      was, except Norman, on whose mind the scene was branded indelibly; she guessed that it was to
      avoid it that he went along what was called Randall's Alley, his usual short cut to
      school.</p>
     <p>That Sunday brought back to the children that there was no one to hear their hymns; but
      Richard was a great comfort, watching over the little ones more like a sister than a brother.
      Ethel was ashamed of herself when she saw him taking thought for them, tying Blanche's bonnet,
      putting Aubrey's gloves on, teaching them to put away their Sunday toys, as if he meant them
      to be as neat and precise as himself.</p>
     <pb n="45"/>
     <p>Dr. May did not encounter the family dinner, nor attempt a second going to Church; but
      Blanche was very glorious, as she led him down to drink tea, and, before going up again, he
      had a conversation with Alan Ernescliffe, who felt himself obliged to leave Stoneborough early
      on the morrow.</p>
     <p>'I can endure better to go now,' said he, 'and I shall hear of you often; Hector will let me
      know, and Richard has promised to write.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, you must let us often have a line. I should guess you were a letter writing man.'</p>
     <p>'I have hitherto had too few friends who cared to hear of me to write much, but the pleasure
      of knowing that any interest is taken in me here—'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said the Doctor, 'mind that a letter will always be welcome, and when you are coming
      southwards, here are your old quarters. 'We cannot lose sight of you any way, especially—' and
      his voice quivered, 'after the help you gave my poor boys and girls in their distress.'</p>
     <p>'It would be the utmost satisfaction to think, I had been of the smallest use,' said Alan,
      hiding much under these common-place words.</p>
     <p>'More than I know,' said Dr. May; 'too much to speak of— Well, we shall see you again,
      though it is a changed place, and you must come and see your god-daughter—poor child—may she
      only be brought up as her sisters were! They will do their best, poor things, and so must I,
      but it is sad work!'</p>
     <p>Both were too much overcome for words, but the Doctor was the first to continue, as he took
      off his dimmed spectacles. He seemed to wish to excuse himself for giving way; saying, with a
      look that would fain have been a smile, 'The world has run so light and easy with me hitherto,
      that you see I don't know how to bear with trouble. All thinking and managing fell to my
      Maggie's share, and I had as little care on my hands as one of my own boys—poor fellows. I
      don't know how it is to turn out, but of all the men on earth to be left with eleven children,
      I should choose myself as the worst.'</p>
     <p>Alan tried to say somewhat of 'Confidence—affection—daughters,' and broke down, but it did
      as well as if it had been connected.</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes,' said the Doctor, 'they are good children, everyone of them. There's much to be
      thankful for, if one could only pluck up heart to feel it.'</p>
     <p>'And you are convinced that Marga—that Miss May is recovering.'</p>
     <p>'She has made a great advance to-day. The head is right, at least,' but the Doctor looked
      anxious, and spoke low, as he said, 'I am not satisfied about her yet. That want of power over
      the limbs is more than the mere shock and debility, as it seems to me, though Ward thinks
      otherwise, and I trust he is right; but I cannot tell yet
      <pb n="46"/> as to the spine. If this should not soon mend, I shall have Fleet to see her. He
      was a fellow-student of mine, very clever, and I have more faith in him than in anyone else in
      that line.'</p>
     <p>'By all means—Yes—' said Alan, excessively shocked. 'But you will let me know how she goes
      on—Richard will be so kind.'</p>
     <p>'We will not fail,' said Dr. May, more and more touched at the sight of the young sailor
      struggling in vain to restrain his emotion; 'you shall hear. I'll write myself, as soon as I
      can use my hand, but I hope she may be all right long before that is likely to be.'</p>
     <p>'Your kindness—' Alan attempted to say, but began again. 'Feeling as I must—' then
      interrupting himself. 'I beg your pardon, 'tis no fit time, nor fit— But you'll let me
      hear.'</p>
     <p>'That I will,' said Dr. May, and as Alan hastily left the room, he continued, half aloud, to
      himself, 'Poor boy! poor fellow! I see. No wonder! Heaven grant I have not been the breaking
      of their two young hearts, as well as my own! Maggie looked doubtful— as much as she ever did
      when my mind was set on a thing, when I spoke of bringing him here. But after all, she liked
      him as much as the rest of us did—she could not wish it otherwise—he is one of a thousand, and
      worthy of our Margaret. That he is! and Maggie thinks so. If he gets on in his profession, why
      then we shall see—' but the sigh of anguish of mind, here showed that the wound had but been
      forgotten for one moment.</p>
     <p>'Pshaw! What am I running on to? I'm all astray for want of her! My poor girl—'</p>
     <p>Mr. Ernescliffe set out before sun-rise. The boys were up to wish him good-bye, and so were
      Etheldred and Mary, and some one else, for while the shaking of hands was going on in the
      hall, there was a call 'Mr. Ernthcliffe,' and over the balusters peeped a little rough curly
      head, a face glowing with carnation deepened by sleep, and a round, plump, bare arm and
      shoulder; and down at Alan's feet there fell a construction of white and pink paper, while a
      voice lisped out 'Mr. Ernthcliffe, there's a white rothe for you.'</p>
     <p>An indignant 'Miss Blanche!' was heard behind, and there was no certainty that any thanks
      reached the poor little heroine, who was evidently borne off summarily to the nursery, while
      Ethel gave way to a paroxysm of suppressed laughter, joined in, more or less, by all the rest;
      and thus Alan, promising faithfully to preserve the precious token, left Dr. May's door, not
      in so much outward sorrow as he had expected.</p>
     <p>Even their father laughed at the romance of the white 'rothe,' and declared Blanche was a
      dangerous young lady; but the story was less successful with Miss Winter, who gravely said it
      was no wonder, since Blanche's elder sister had been setting her the example
      <pb n="47"/> of forwardness in coming down in this way after Mr. Ernescliffe. Ethel was very
      angry, and was only prevented from vindicating herself, by remembering there was no
      peace-maker now, and that she had resolved only to think of Miss Winter's late kindness, and
      bear with her tiresome ways.</p>
     <p>Etheldred thought herself too sorrowful to be liable to her usual faults, which would seem
      so much worse now; but she found herself more irritable than usual, and doubly heedless,
      because her mind was pre-occupied. She hated herself, and suffered more from sorrow than even
      at the first moment, for now she felt what it was to have no one to tame her, no eye over her;
      she found herself going <hi>à tort et à travers</hi> all the morning, and with no one to set
      her right. Since it was so the first day, what would follow?</p>
     <p>Mary was on the contrary so far subdued, as to be exemplary in goodness and diligence, and
      Blanche was always steady. Flora was too busy to think of the school-room, for the whole house
      was on her hands, besides the charge of Margaret, while Dr. May went to the hospital, and to
      sundry patients, and they thought he seemed the better for the occupation, as well as
      gratified and affected by the sympathy he everywhere met with, from high and low.</p>
     <p>The boys were at school, unseen except when at the dinner play-hour, Norman ran home to ask
      after his father and sister, but the most trying time was at eight in the evening, when they
      came home. That was wont to be the merriest part of the whole day, the whole family collected,
      papa at leisure and ready for talk or for play, mamma smiling over her work-basket, the
      sisters full of chatter, the brothers full of fun, all the tidings of the day discussed, and
      nothing unwelcome but bed-time. How different now! The Doctor was with Margaret, and though
      Richard tried to say something cheerful, as his brothers entered, there was no response, and
      they sat down on the opposite sides of the fire, forlorn and silent, till Richard who was
      printing some letters on card-board to supply the gaps in Aubrey's ivory Alphabet, called
      Harry to help him; but Ethel, as she sat at work, could only look at Norman, and wish she
      could devise anything likely to gratify him.</p>
     <p>After a time Flora came down, and laying some sheets of closely written note paper before
      her sister, said, 'Here is dear mama's unfinished letter to aunt Flora. Papa says we elder
      ones are to read it. It is a description of us all, and very much indeed we ought to learn
      from it. I shall keep a copy of it.'</p>
     <p>Flora took up her work, and began to consult with Richard, while Ethel moved to Norman's
      side, and kneeling so as to lean against his shoulder, as he sat on a low cushion, they read
      their mother's last letter, by the fire-light, with indescribable feelings, as
      <pb n="48"/> they went through the subjects that had lately occupied them, related by her who
      would never be among them again. After much of this kind, for her letters to Mrs. Arnott were
      almost journals, came,</p>
     <p>'You say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies, and if I do not
      write in these leisure days, you will hardly get it after I am in the midst of business again.
      The new Daisy is like Margaret at the same age—may she continue like her! Pretty creature, she
      can hardly be more charming than at present. Aubrey, the moon-faced, is far from reconciled to
      his deposition from babyhood; he is a sober, solemn gentleman, backward in talking, and with
      such a will of his own, as will want much watching; very different from Blanche, who is Flora
      over again, perhaps prettier, and more fairy-like, unless this is only one's admiration for
      the buds of the present season. None of them has ever been so winning as this little maid, who
      even attracts Dr. Hoxton himself, and obtains sugar-plums and kisses. "Rather she than I,"
      says Harry, but notice is notice to the white Mayflower, and there is my anxiety—I am afraid
      it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to get a rebuff. I hope having a younger sister,
      and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary. Flora soon left off thinking about her beauty, and
      the fit of vanity does less harm at five than fifteen. My poor Tom has not such a happy life
      as Blanche, he is often in trouble at lessons, and bullied by Harry at play, in spite of his
      champion, Mary; and yet I cannot interfere, for it is good for him to have all this
      preparatory teazing, before he goes into school. He has good abilities, but not much
      perseverance or energy, and I must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his
      school-days begin, in hopes of instilling them. The girlishness and timidity will be knocked
      out of him by the boys, I suppose; Harry is too kind and generous to do more than teaze him
      moderately, and Norman will see that it does not go too far. It is a common saying that Tom
      and Mary made a mistake, that he is the girl, and she the boy, for she is a rough, merry
      creature, the noisiest in the house, always skirmishing with Harry in defence of Tom, and yet
      devoted to him, and wanting to do everything he does. Those two, Harry and Mary, are exactly
      alike, except for Harry's curly mane of lion-coloured wig. The "yellow haired laddie" is
      papa's name for Harry, which he does not mind from him, though furious if the girls attempt to
      call him so. Harry is the thorough boy of the family, all spirit, recklessness, and mischief,
      but so true, and kind, and noble-hearted, that one loves him the better after every freely
      confessed scrape. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to my boy for his perfect confidence,
      the thing that chiefly lessens my anxiety for him in his half-school, half-home life, which
      does not seem to me to work quite well with him. There are two sons of Mrs. Anderson's at the
      school, who are more his friends than I like, and he is too easily led by the desire not to be
      outdone, and to show that he fears nothing. Lately, our sailor-guest has inspired him with a
      vehement wish to go to sea; I wish it was not necessary that the decision should be made so
      early in life, for this fault is just what would make us most fear to send him into the world
      very young, though in some ways it might not do amiss for him.</p>
     <p>So much for the younger bairns, whom you never beheld, dear Flora. The three whom you left,
      when people used to waste pity on me for their being all babies together, now look as if any
      pair of them were twins, for Norman is the tallest, almost outgrowing his strength, and
      Ethel's sharp face, so like her papa's, makes her look older than Flora. Norman and Ethel do
      indeed take after their papa, more than any of the others, and are much alike. There is the
      same brilliant cleverness, the same strong feeling, not easy of demonstration, though
      impetuous in action; but poor Ethel's old foibles, her harum-scarum nature, quick temper,
      uncouth manners, and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object, have kept her back, and
      caused her much discomfort; yet I sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a
      discipline that is the best thing for the character in the end. They are faults that show
      themselves, and which one can tell how to deal with, and I have full confidence that she has
      the principle within her that will conquer them.'</p>
     <pb n="49"/>
     <p>'If—' mournfully sighed Ethel; but her brother pointed on further.</p>
     <p>'My great hope is her entire indifference to praise—not approval, but praise. If she has not
      come up to her own standard, she works on, not always with good temper, but perseveringly, and
      entirely, unheeding of commendation till she has satisfied herself, only thinking it stupid
      not to see the faults. It is this independence of praise that I want to see in her brother and
      sister. They justly earn it, and are rightly pleased with it; but I cannot feel sure whether
      they do not depend on it too much. Norman lives, like all school-boys, a life of emulation,
      and has never met with anything but success. I do believe Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Wilmot are as
      proud of him as we are; and he has never shown any tendency to conceit, but I am afraid he has
      the love of being foremost, and pride in his superiority, caring for what he is, compared with
      others, rather than what he is himself.'</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Norman; 'I have done so, but that's over. I see what it is worth. I'd give
      all the <hi>quam optimès</hi> I ever got in my life to be the help Richard is to papa.'</p>
     <p>'You would if you were his age.'</p>
     <p>'Not I, I'm not the sort. I'm not like her. But are we to go on about the elders?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! yes, don't let us miss a word. There can't be anything but praise of them.'</p>
     <p>'Your sweet goddaughter. I almost feel as if I had spoken in disparagement of her, but I
      meant no such thing, dear girl. It would be hard to find a fault in her, since the childish
      love of admiration was subdued. She is so solid and steady, as to be very valuable with the
      younger ones, and is fast growing so lovely, that I wish you could behold her. I do not see
      any vanity, but there lies my dread, not of beauty-vanity, but that she will find temptation
      in the being everywhere liked and sought after. As to Margaret, my precious companion and
      friend, you have heard enough of her to know her, and, as to telling you what she is like, I
      could as soon set about describing her papa. When I thought of not being spared to them this
      time, it was happiness indeed to think of her at their head, fit to be his companion, with so
      much of his own talent as to be more up to conversation with him, than he could ever have
      found his stupid old Maggie. It was rather a trial of her discretion to have Mr. Ernescliffe
      here while I was up-stairs, and very well she seems to have come out of it. Poor Richard's
      last disappointment is still our chief trouble. He has been working hard with a tutor all
      through the vacation, and has not even come home to see his new sister, on his way to Oxford.
      He had made a resolution that he would not come to us, till he had passed, and his father
      thought it best that it should be kept. I hope he will succeed next time, but his nervousness
      renders it still more doubtful. With him it is the very reverse of Norman. He suffers too much
      for want of commendation, and I cannot wonder at it, when I see how much each failure vexes
      his father, and Richard little knows how precious is our perfect confidence in him, how much
      more valuable than any honours he could earn. You would be amused to see how little he is
      altered from the pretty little fair fellow, that you used to say, was so like my old portrait,
      even the wavy rings of light glossy hair sit on his forehead, just as you liked to twist them;
      and his small trim figure is a fine contrast to Norman's long legs and arms, which—'</p>
     <p>There the letter broke off, the playful affection of the last words making it almost more
      painful to think that the fond hand would never finish the sentence.</p>

     <p>'So there you are up for the day—really you look very comfortable,' said Ethel,
      coming into the room where Margaret lay on her bed, half raised by pillows, supported by a
      wooden frame.</p>
     <p>'Yes, is not it a charming contrivance of Richard's? It quite gives me the use of my hands,'
      said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I think he is doing something else for you,' said Ethel; 'I heard him carpentering at six
      o'clock this morning, but I suppose it is to be a secret.'</p>
     <p>'And don't you admire her night-cap?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Is it any thing different?' said Ethel, peering closer. 'O, I see—so she has a fine day
      night-cap. Is that your taste, Flora?'</p>
     <p>'Partly,' said Margaret, 'and partly my own. I put in all these little white puffs, and I
      hope you think they do me credit. Wasn't it grand of me?'</p>
     <p>'She only despises you for them,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I'm very glad you could,' said Ethel, gravely; 'but do you know? it is rather like that
      horrid old lady in some book, who had a paralytic stroke, and the first thing she did that
      showed she had come to her senses was to write, "Rose-coloured curtains for the Doctors."'</p>
     <p>'Well, it was for the Doctor,' said Margaret, 'and it had its effect. He told me I looked
      much better when he found me trying it on.'</p>
     <p>'And did you really have the looking-glass and try it on?' cried Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes, really,' said Flora. 'Don't you think one may as well be fit to be seen if one is ill?
      It is no use to depress one's friends by being more forlorn and disconsolate than one can
      help.'</p>
     <p>'No—not disconsolate,' said Ethel; 'but the white puffiness— and the hemming—and the
      glass!'</p>
     <p>'Poor Ethel can't get over it,' said Margaret. 'But, Ethel, do you think there is nothing
      disconsolate in untidiness?'</p>
     <p>'You could be tidy without the little puffs! Your first bit of work too! Don't think I'm
      tiresome. If they were an amusement to you, I am sure I am very glad of them, but I can't see
      the sense of them.'</p>
     <pb n="51"/>
     <p>'Poor little things!' said Margaret laughing. 'It is only my foible for making a thing look
      nice. And, Ethel,' she added, drawing her down close over her, 'I did not think the trouble
      wasted, if seeing me look fresher cheered up dear papa a moment.'</p>
     <p>'I spoke to papa about nurse's proposal,' said Margaret presently to Flora, 'and he quite
      agrees to it. Indeed it is impossible that Anne should attend properly to all the children
      while nurse is so much engaged with me.'</p>
     <p>'I think so,' said Flora; 'and it does not answer to bring Aubrey into the school-room. It
      only makes Mary and Blanche idle, and Miss Winter does not like it.'</p>
     <p>'Then the question is, who shall it be? Nurse has no one in view, and only protests against
      "one of the girls out of the school here."'</p>
     <p>'That's a great pity,' said Flora. 'Don't you think we could make her take to Jane White,
      she is so very nice.'</p>
     <p>'I thought of her, but it will never answer if we displease nurse. Besides, I remember at
      the time Anne came, dear mamma thought there was danger of a girl's having too many
      acquaintances, especially taking the children out walking. We cannot always be sure of sending
      her out with Anne.'</p>
     <p>'Do you remember—'said Ethel, there stopping.</p>
     <p>'Well,' said both sisters.</p>
     <p>'Don't you recollect, Flora, that girl whose father was in the hospital—that girl at
      Cocksmoor?'</p>
     <p>'I do, said Flora, 'She was a very nice girl; I wonder whether nurse would approve of
      her.'</p>
     <p>'How old?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Fourteen, and tall. Such a clean cottage!'</p>
     <p>The girls went on, and Margaret began to like the idea very much, and consider whether the
      girl could be brought for inspection, before nurse was prejudiced by hearing of her Cocksmoor
      extraction. At that moment Richard knocked at the door, and entered with Tom, helping him to
      bring a small short-legged table, such as could stand on the bed at the right height for
      Margaret's meals or employments.</p>
     <p>There were great exclamations of satisfaction, and gratitude; 'it was the very thing wanted,
      only how could he have contrived it?'</p>
     <p>'Don't you recognise it?' said he.</p>
     <p>'O, I see; it is the old drawing-desk that no one used. And you have put legs to it—how
      famous! You are the best contriver, Richard!'</p>
     <p>'Then see, you can raise it up for reading or writing; here's a corner for your ink to stand
      flat; and there it is down for your dinner.'</p>
     <pb n="52"/>
     <p>'Charming, you have made it go so easily, when it used to be so stiff. There—give me my
      work-basket, please, Ethel; I mean to make some more white puffs.'</p>
     <p>'What's the matter now, Ethel?' said Flora; 'you look as if you did not approve of the
      table.'</p>
     <p>'I was only thinking it was as if she was settling herself to lie in bed for a very long
      time,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I hope not, said Richard; 'but I don't see why she should not be as comfortable as she can,
      while she is there.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure I hope you will never be ill, Ethel,' said Flora. You would be horrid to
      nurse!'</p>
     <p>'She will know how to be grateful when she is,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I say, Richard,' exclaimed Ethel, 'this is hospital-meeting day, so you won't be wanted to
      drive papa.</p>
     <p>'No, I am at your service; do you want a walk?'</p>
     <p>So it was determined that Richard and Ethel should walk together to Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>No two people could be much more unlike than Richard and Etheldred May; but they were very
      fond of each other. Richard was sometimes seriously annoyed by Ethel's heedlessness, and did
      not always understand her sublimities, but he had a great deal of admiration for one who
      partook so much of his father's nature; and Ethel had a due respect for her eldest brother,
      gratitude and strong affection for many kindnesses, a reverence for his sterling goodness, and
      his exemption from her own besetting failings, only a little damped by compassionate wonder at
      his deficiency in talent, and by her vexation at not being always comprehended.</p>
     <p>They went by the road, for the plantation gate was far too serious an undertaking for anyone
      not in the highest spirits for enterprise. On the way there was a good deal of that desultory
      talk, very sociable and interesting, that is apt to prevail between two people, who would
      never have chosen each other for companions, if they were not of the same family, but who are
      nevertheless very affectionate and companionable. Ethel was anxious to hear what her brother
      thought of papa's spirits, and whether he talked in their drives.</p>
     <p>'Sometimes,' said Richard. 'It is just as it happens. Now and then he goes on just like
      himself, and then at other times he will not speak for three or four miles.'</p>
     <p>'And he sighs?' said Ethel. 'Those sighs are so very sad, and long, and deep! They seem to
      have whole volumes in them, as if there was such a weight on him.'</p>
     <p>'Some people say he is not as much altered as they expected,' said Richard.</p>
     <pb n="53"/>
     <p>'Oh! do they? Well! I can't fancy any one feeling it more. He can't leave off his old self,
      of course, but'—Ethel stopped short.</p>
     <p>'Margaret is a great comfort to him,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'That she is. She thinks of him all day long, and I don't think either of them is ever so
      happy as in the evening, when he sits with her. They talk about mamma then'—</p>
     <p>It was just what Richard could not do, and he made some observation to change the subject,
      but Ethel returned to it, so far as to beg to know how the arm was going on, for she did not
      like to say any thing about it to papa.</p>
     <p>'It will be a long business, I am afraid,' said Richard. 'Indeed, he said the other day, he
      thought he should never have the free use of the elbow.'</p>
     <p>'And do you think it is very painful? I saw the other day, when Aubrey was sitting on his
      knee and fidgetting, he shrank whenever he even came towards it, and yet it seemed as if he
      could not bear to put him down.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, it is excessively tender, and sometimes gets very bad at night.'</p>
     <p>'Ah,' said Ethel, 'there's a line—here—round his eyes, that there never used to be, and when
      it deepens, I am sure he is in pain, or has been kept awake.'</p>
     <p>'You are very odd, Ethel; how do you see things in people's faces, when you miss so much at
      just the same distance?</p>
     <p>'I look after what I care about,' said Ethel. 'One sees more with one's mind than one's
      eyes. The best sight is inside.'</p>
     <p>'But do you always see the truth?' said Richard gravely.</p>
     <p>'Quite enough. What is less common than the ordinary world?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>Richard shook his head, not quite satisfied, but not sure enough that he entered into her
      meaning to question it.</p>
     <p>'I wonder you don't wear spectacles,' was the result of his meditation, and it made her
      laugh by being so inapposite to her own reflections; but the laugh ended in a melancholy look.
      'Dear mamma did not like me to use them,' she said, in a low voice.</p>
     <p>Thus they talked till they arrived at Cocksmoor, where poor Mrs. Taylor, inspirited by
      better reports of her husband and the hopes for her daughter, was like another woman. Richard
      was very careful not to raise false expectations, saying it all depended on Miss May and
      nurse, and what they thought of her strength and steadiness, but these cautions did not seem
      capable of damping the hopes of the smooth-haired Lucy, who stood smiling and curtseying. The
      twins were grown and improved, and Ethel supposed they would be brought to Church on the next
      Christening Sunday, but their mother looked helpless and hopeless about getting
      <pb n="54"/> them so far, and how was she to get gossips? Ethel began to grow very indignant,
      but she was always shy of finding fault with poor people to their faces when she would not
      have done so to persons in her own station, and so she was silent, while Richard hoped they
      would be able to manage, and said it would be better not to wait another month for still worse
      weather and shorter days.</p>
     <p>As they were coming out of the house, a big, rough-looking, uncivilized boy came up before
      them, and called out, 'I say—ben't you the young Doctor up at Stoneborough?'</p>
     <p>'I am Dr. May's son,' said Richard; while Ethel, startled, clung to his arm, in dread of
      some rudeness.</p>
     <p>'Granny's bad,' said the boy; proceeding without further explanation to lead the way to
      another hovel, though Richard tried to explain that the knowledge of medicine was not in his
      case hereditary. A poor old woman sat groaning over the fire, and two children crouched,
      half-clothed on the bare floor.</p>
     <p>Richard's gentle voice and kind manner drew forth some wonderful descriptions—'her head was
      all of a goggle, her legs all of a fur, she felt as if some one was cutting right through
      her.'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Richard, kindly, 'I am no Doctor myself, but I'll ask my father about you, and
      perhaps he can give you an order for the hospital.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, thank ye, Sir; I can't go to the hospital, I can't leave these poor children;
      they've no father nor mother, Sir, and no one to do for them but me.'</p>
     <p>'What do you all live on, then?' said Richard, looking round the desolate hut.</p>
     <p>'On Sam's wages, Sir; that's that boy. He is a good boy to me, Sir, and his little sisters;
      he brings it, all he gets, home to me, rig'lar, but 'tis but six shillings a week, and they
      makes 'em take half of it out in goods and beer, which is a bad thing for a boy like him,
      Sir.'</p>
     <p>'How old are you, Sam?'</p>
     <p>Sam scratched his head, and answered nothing. His grandmother knew he was the age of her
      black bonnet, and as he looked about fifteen, Ethel honoured him and the bonnet accordingly,
      while Richard said he must be very glad to be able to maintain them all, at his age, and,
      promising to try to bring his father that way, since prescribing at second hand for such
      curious symptoms was more than could be expected, he took his leave.</p>
     <p>'A wretched place,' said Richard, looking round. 'I don't know what help there is for the
      people. There's no one to do any thing for them, and it is of no use to tell them to come to
      Church when it is so far off, and there is so little room for them.'</p>
     <p>'It is miserable,' said Ethel; and all her thoughts during her last
      <pb n="55"/> walk thither began to rush over her again, not effaced, but rather burnt in, by
      all that had subsequently happened. She had said it should be her aim and effort to make
      Cocksmoor a Christian place. Such a resolve must not pass away lightly; she knew it must be
      acted on, but how? What would her present means—one sovereign —effect? Her fancies, rich and
      rare, had nearly been forgotten of late, but she might make them of use in time—in time, and
      here were hives of children growing up in heathenism. Suddenly an idea struck her—Richard,
      when at home, was a very diligent teacher in the Sunday-school at Stoneborough, though it was
      a thankless task, and he was the only gentleman so engaged, except the two Clergymen—the other
      male teachers being a formal, grave, little baker, and one or two monitors.</p>
     <p>'Richard,' said Ethel, 'I'll tell you what. Suppose we were to set up a Sunday-school at
      Cocksmoor. We could get a room, and walk there every Sunday afternoon, and go to Church in the
      evening instead.'</p>
     <p>He was so confounded by the suddenness of the project, that he did not answer, till she had
      time for several exclamations and 'Well, Richards!'</p>
     <p>'I cannot tell,' he said. 'Going to Church in the evening would interfere with tea-time—put
      out all the house—make the evening uncomfortable.'</p>
     <p>'The evenings are horrid now, especially Sundays,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'But missing two more would make them worse for the others.'</p>
     <p>'Papa is always with Margaret,' said Ethel. 'We are of no use to him. Besides those poor
      children—are not they of more importance?'</p>
     <p>'And, then, what is to become of Stoneborough school?'</p>
     <p>'I hate it,' exclaimed Ethel; then seeing Richard shocked, and finding she had spoken more
      vehemently than she intended—'It is not as bad for you among the boys, but while that
      committee goes on, it is not the least use to try to teach the girls right. Oh! the fusses
      about the books, and one's way of teaching! And fancy how Mrs. Ledwich used us. You know I
      went again last Sunday, for the first time, and there I found that class of Margaret's, that
      she had just managed to get into some degree of nice order, taken so much pains with, taught
      so well. She had been telling me what to hear them—there it is given away to Fanny Anderson,
      who is no more fit to teach than that stick, and all Margaret's work will be undone. No notice
      to us—not even the civility to wait and see when she gets better.'</p>
     <p>'If we left them now for Cocksmoor, would it not look as if we were affronted?'</p>
     <pb n="56"/>
     <p>Ethel was slightly taken aback, but only said, 'Papa would be very angry if he knew it.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad you did not tell him,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'I thought it would only tease him,' said Ethel, 'and that he might call it a petty female
      squabble; and when Margaret is well, it will come right, if Fanny Anderson has not spoilt the
      girls in the meantime. It is all Mrs. Ledwich's doing. How I did hate it when every one came
      up and shook hands with me, and asked after Margaret and papa, only just out of
      curiosity!'</p>
     <p>'Hush, hush, Ethel, what's the use of thinking such things?'</p>
     <p>A silence,—then she exclaimed, 'But, indeed, Richard, you don't fancy that I want to teach
      at Cocksmoor, because it is disagreeable at Stoneborough?'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed.'</p>
     <p>The rendering of full justice conveyed in his tone, so opened Ethel's heart, that she went
      on eagerly:—'The history of it is this. Last time we walked here, <hi>that</hi> day, I said,
      and I meant it, that I would never put it out of my head; I would go on doing and striving,
      and trying, till this place was properly cared for, and has a Church and a Clergyman. I
      believe it was a vow, Richard, I do believe it was,—and if one makes one, one must keep it.
      There it is. So, I can't give money, I have but one pound in the world, but I have time, and I
      would make that useful, if you would help me.'</p>
     <p>'I don't see how,' was the answer, and there was a fragment of a smile on Richard's face, as
      if it struck him as a wild scheme, that Ethel should undertake, single handed, to evangelize
      Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>It was such a damper as to be most mortifying to an enthusiastic girl, and she drew into
      herself in a moment.</p>
     <p>They walked home in silence, and when Richard warned her that she was not keeping her dress
      out of the dirt, it sounded like a sarcasm on her projects, and, with a slightly pettish
      manner, she raised the unfortunate skirt, its crape trimmings greatly bespattered with ruddy
      mud. Then recollecting how mamma would have shaken her head at that very thing, she regretted
      the temper she had betrayed, and in a ' <hi>larmoyante</hi> ' voice, sighed, 'I wish I could
      pick my way better. Some people have the gift, you have hardly a splash, and I'm up to the
      ancles in mud.'</p>
     <p>'It is only taking care,' said Richard; 'besides your frock is so long, and full. Can't you
      tuck it up, and pin it?'</p>
     <p>'My pins always come out,' said Ethel, disconsolately, crumpling the black folds into one
      hand, while she hunted for a pin with the other.</p>
     <p>'No wonder, if you stick them in that way,' said Richard. 'Oh!
      <pb n="57"/> you'll tear that crape. Here, let me help you. Don't you see, make it go in and
      out, that way; give it something to pull against.'</p>
     <p>Ethel laughed. 'That's the third thing you have taught me—to thread a needle, tie a bow, and
      stick in a pin! I never could learn those things of anyone else; they show, but don't explain
      the theory.'</p>
     <p>They met Dr. May at the entrance of the town, very tired, and saying he had been a long
      tramp, all over the place, and Mrs. Hoxton had been boring him with her fancies. As he took
      Richard's arm he gave the long heavy sigh that always fell so painfully on Ethel's ear.</p>
     <p>'Dear, dear, dear papa! thought she, 'my work must also be to do all I can to comfort
      him.'</p>
     <p>Her reflections were broken off. Dr. May exclaimed, 'Ethel, don't make such a figure of
      yourself. Those muddy ancles and petticoats are not fit to be seen—there, now you are sweeping
      the pavement. Have you no medium? One would think you had never worn a gown in your life
      before!'</p>
     <p>Poor Ethel step on before with mud-encrusted heels, and her father speaking sharply in the
      weariness and soreness of his heart; her draggle-tailed petticoats weighing down at once her
      missionary projects at Cocksmoor, and her tender visions of comforting her widowed father; her
      heart was full to overflowing, and where was the mother to hear her troubles?</p>
     <p>She opened the hall door, and would have rushed up stairs, but nurse happened to be crossing
      the hall. 'Miss Ethel! Miss Ethel, you arn't going up with them boots on! I do declare you are
      just like one of the boys. And your frock!'</p>
     <p>Ethel sat submissively down on the lowest step, and pulled off her boots. As she did so, her
      father and brother came in—the former desiring Richard to come with him to the study, and
      write a note for him. She hoped that thus she might have Margaret to herself, and hurried into
      her room. Margaret was alone, maids and children at tea, and Flora dressing. The room was in
      twilight, with the red gleam of the fire playing cheerfully over it.</p>
     <p>'Well, Ethel, have you had a pleasant walk?'</p>
     <p>'Yes—no—Oh Margaret!' and throwing herself across the bottom of the bed, she burst into
      tears.</p>
     <p>'Ethel, dear, what is the matter? Papa—'</p>
     <p>'No—no—only I draggled my frock, and Richard threw cold water. And I am good for nothing!
      Oh! if mamma was but here!'</p>
     <p>'Darling Ethel, dear Ethel, I wish I could comfort you. Come a little nearer to me, I can't
      reach you! Dear Ethel, what has gone wrong?'</p>
     <p>'Every thing,' said Ethel. 'No—I'm too dirty to come on your white bed; I forgot, you won't
      like it,' added she, in an injured tone.</p>
     <pb n="58"/>
     <p>'You are wet, you are cold, you are tired,' said Margaret. 'Stay here and dress, don't go up
      in the cold. There, sit by the fire, pull off your frock and stockings, and we will send for
      the others. Let me see you look comfortable—there. Now tell me who threw cold water.'</p>
     <p>'It was figurative cold water,' said Ethel, smiling for a moment. 'I was only silly enough
      to tell Richard my plan, and it's horrid to talk to a person who only thinks one high-flying
      and nonsensical— and then came the dirt.'</p>
     <p>'But what was the scheme, Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'Cocksmoor,' said Ethel, proceeding to unfold it.</p>
     <p>'I wish we could,' said Margaret. 'It would be an excellent thing. But how did Richard vex
      you?'</p>
     <p>'I don't know,' said Ethel, 'only he thought it would not do. Perhaps he said right, but it
      was coldly, and he smiled.'</p>
     <p>'He is too sober-minded for our flights,' said Margaret. 'I know the feeling of it, Ethel
      dear; but you know if he did see that some of your plans might not answer, it is no reason you
      should not try to do something at once. You have not told me about the girl.'</p>
     <p>Ethel proceeded to tell the history. 'There!' said Margaret, cheerfully, 'there are two ways
      of helping Cocksmoor already. Could you not make some clothes for the two grand-children? I
      could help you a little, and then, if they were well clothed, you might get them to come to
      the Sunday-school. And as to the twins, I wonder what the hire of a cart would be to bring the
      Christening party? It is just what Richard could manage.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel; 'but those are only little isolated individual things!'</p>
     <p>'But one must make a beginning.'</p>
     <p>'Then, Margaret, you think it was a real vow? You don't think it silly of me?' said Ethel,
      wistfully.</p>
     <p>'Ethel, dear, I don't think dear mamma would say we ought to make vows, except what the
      Church decrees for us. I don't think she would like the motion of your considering yourself
      pledged; but I do think, that, after all you have said and felt about Cocksmoor, and being led
      there on that day, it does seem as if we might be intended to make it our especial
      charge.'</p>
     <p>'O Margaret, I am glad you say so. You always understand.'</p>
     <p>'But you know we are so young, that now we have not her to judge for us, we must only do
      little things that we are quite sure of, or we shall get wrong.'</p>
     <p>'That's not the way great things were done.'</p>
     <p>'I don't know, Ethel; I think great things can't be good unless they stand on a sure
      foundation of little ones.'</p>
     <pb n="59"/>
     <p>'Well, I believe Richard was right, and it would not do to begin on Sunday, but he was so
      tame; and then my frock, and the horrid deficiency in those little neatnesses.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps that is good for you in one way; you might get very high-flying if you had not the
      discipline of those little tiresome things; correcting them will help you, and keep your high
      things from being all romance. I know dear mamma used to say so; that the trying to conquer
      them was a help to you. O, here's Mary! Mary, will you get Ethel's dressing things? She has
      come home wet-footed and cold, and has been warming herself by my fire.'</p>
     <p>Mary was happy to help, and Ethel was dressed and cheered by the time. Dr. May came in, for
      a hurried visit and report of his doings; Flora followed on her way from her room. Then all
      went to tea, leaving Margaret to have a visit from the little ones under charge of nurse. Two
      hours' stay with her, that precious time when she knew that sad as the talk often was, it was
      truly a comfort to him. It ended when ten o'clock struck, and he went down—Margaret hearing
      the bell, the sounds of the assembling servants, the shutting of the door, the stillness of
      prayer time, the opening again, the feet moving off in different directions, then brothers and
      sisters coming in to kiss her and bid her good-night, nurse and Flora arranging her for the
      night, Flora coming to sleep in her little bed in the corner of the room, and, lastly, her
      father's tender good-night, and melancholy look at her, and all was quiet, except the low
      voices and movements as Richard attended him in his own room.</p>
     <p>Margaret could think: 'Dear, dear Ethel, how noble and high she is! But I am afraid! It is
      what people call a difficult, dangerous age, and the grander she is, the greater danger of not
      managing her rightly. If those high purposes should run only into romance like mine, or grow
      out into eccentricities and unfemininesses, what a grievous pity it would be! And I, so little
      older, so much less clever, with just sympathy enough not to be a wise restraint—I am the
      person who has the responsibility, and oh, what shall I do? Mamma trusted to me to be a mother
      to them, papa looks to me, and I so unfit, besides this helplessness. But God sent it, and put
      me in my place. He made me lie here, and will raise me up if it is good, so I trust He will
      help me with my sisters.'</p>
     <p>'Grant me to have a right judgment in all things, and evermore to rejoice in Thy holy
      comfort.'</p>

      <l>'Something between a hindrance and a help.'</l><p><hi>Wordsworth.</hi></p></quote>
     <p>Etheldred awoke long before time for getting up, and lay pondering over her
      visions. Margaret had sympathized, and therefore they did not seem entirely aërial. To earn
      money by writing was her favourite plan, and she called her various romances in turn before
      her memory, to judge which might be brought down to sober pen and ink. She considered till it
      became not too unreasonably early to get up. It was dark, but there was a little light close
      to the window: she had no writing-paper, but she would interline her old exercisebook. Down
      she ran, and crouching in the school-room window-seat, she wrote on in a trance of eager
      composition, till Norman called her, as he went to school, to help him to find a book.</p>
     <p>This done, she went up to visit Margaret, to tell her the story, and consult her. But this
      was not so easy. She found Margaret with little Daisy lying by her, and Tom sitting by the
      fire over his Latin.</p>
     <p>'O, Ethel, good morning, dear! you are come just in time.'</p>
     <p>'To take baby?' said Ethel, as the child was fretting a little.</p>
     <p>'Yes, thank you, she has been very good, but she was tired of lying here, and I can't move
      her about,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'O Margaret, I have such a plan,' said Ethel, as she walked about with little Gertrude; but
      Tom interrupted.</p>
     <p>'Margaret, will you see if I can say my lesson?' and the thumbed Latin grammar came across
      her just as Dr. May's door opened, and he came in exclaiming, 'Latin grammar! Margaret, this
      is really too much for you. Good morning, my dears. Ha! Tommy, take your book away, my boy.
      You must not inflict that on sister now. There's your regular master, Richard, in my room, if
      it is fit for his ears yet. What, the little one here too?'</p>
     <p>'How is your arm, papa?' said Margaret. 'Did it keep you awake?'</p>
     <p>'Not long—it set me dreaming though, and a very romantic dream it was, worthy of Ethel
      herself.'</p>
     <p>'What was it, papa?'</p>
     <p>'O, it was an odd thing, joining on strangely enough with one I had three or four-and-twenty
      years ago, when I was a young man, hearing lectures at Edinburgh, and courting'—he stopped,
      and felt
      <pb n="61"/> Margaret's pulse, asked her a few questions, and talked to the baby. Ethel longed
      to hear his dream, but thought he would not like to go on; however, he did presently.</p>
     <p>'The old dream was the night after a pic-nic on Arthur's Seat with the Mackenzies; Mamma and
      Aunt Flora were there. 'Twas a regular boy's dream, a tournament, or something of that nature,
      where I was victor, the queen—you know who she was—giving me her token—a Daisy Chain.'</p>
     <p>'That is why you like to call us your Daisy Chain,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Did you write it in verse?' said Margaret. 'I think I once saw some verses like it in her
      desk.'</p>
     <p>'I was in love, and three-and-twenty,' said the Doctor, looking drolly guilty in the midst
      of his sadness. 'Aye, those fixed it in my memory, perhaps my fancy made it more distinct than
      it really was. An evening or two ago, I met with them, and that stirred it up, I suppose. Last
      night came the tournament again, but it was the melée, a sense of being crushed down,
      suffocated by the throng of armed knights and horses—pain and wounds—and I looked in vain
      through the opposing overwhelming host for my—my Maggie. Well, I got the worst of it, my sword
      arm was broken—I fell, was stifled—crushed—in misery—all I could do was to grasp my token —my
      Daisy Chain,' and he pressed Margaret's hand as he said so. 'And, behold, the tumult and
      despair were passed. I lay on the grass in the cloisters, and the Daisy Chain hung from the
      sky, and was drawing me upwards. There—it is a queer dream for a sober old country Doctor. I
      don't know why I told you, don't tell any one again.'</p>
     <p>And he walked away, muttering. 'For he told me his dreams, talked of eating and drinking,'
      leaving Margaret with her eyes full of tears, and Ethel vehemently caressing the baby.</p>
     <p>'How beautiful!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'It has been a comfort to him, I am sure,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'You don't think it ominous,' said Ethel, with a slight tremulous voice.</p>
     <p>'More soothing than any thing else. It is what we all feel, is it not? that this little
      daisy bud is the link between us and heaven?'</p>
     <p>'But about him. He was victor at first—vanquished the next time?'</p>
     <p>'I think—if it is to have an interpretation, though I am not sure we ought to take it so
      seriously, it would only mean that in younger days, people care for victory and distinction in
      this world, like Norman, or as papa most likely did then; but, as they grow older, they care
      less, and others pass them, and they know it does not signify, for in our race all may
      win.'</p>
     <pb n="62"/>
     <p>'But he has a great name. How many people come from a distance to consult him! he is looked
      upon, too, in other ways! he can do anything with the corporation.'</p>
     <p>Margaret smiled. 'All this does not sound grand—it is not as if he had set up in
      London.'</p>
     <p>'Oh dear, I am so glad he did not.'</p>
     <p>'Shall I tell you what mamma told me he said about it, when uncle Mackenzie said he ought?
      He answered, that he thought health and happy home attachments, were a better provision for us
      to set out in life with than thousands.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure he was right!' said Ethel, earnestly. 'Then you don't think the dream meant being
      beaten, only that our best things are not gained by successes in this world?'</p>
     <p>'Don't go and let it dwell on your mind as a vision,' said Margaret. 'I think dear mamma
      would call that silly.'</p>
     <p>An interruption occurred, and Ethel had to go down to breakfast with a mind floating between
      romance, sorrow, and high aspirations, very unlike the actual world she had to live in. First,
      there was a sick man walking into the study, and her father, laying down his letters, saying,
      'I must despatch him before prayers, I suppose. I've a great mind to say I never will see any
      one who wont keep to my days.'</p>
     <p>'I can't imagine why they don't,' said Flora, as he went. 'He is always saying so, but never
      acting on it. If he would once turn one away, the rest would mind.'</p>
     <p>Richard went on in silence, cutting bread and butter.</p>
     <p>'There's another ring,' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Yes, he is caught now, they'll go on in a stream. I shall not keep Margaret waiting for her
      breakfast, I shall take it up.'</p>
     <p>The morning was tiresome; though Dr. May had two regular days for seeing poor people at his
      house, he was too good-natured to keep strictly to them, and this day, as Flora had predicted,
      there was a procession of them not soon got rid of, even by his rapid queries and the
      talismanic figures made by his left hand on scraps of paper, with which he sent them off to
      the infirmary. Ethel tried to read; the children lingered about; it was a trial of temper to
      all but Tom, who obtained Richard's attention to his lessons. He liked to say them to his
      brother, and this was an incentive to learn them quickly, that none might remain for Miss
      Winter when Richard went out with his father. If mamma had been there, she would have had
      prayers; but now no one had authority enough, though they did at last even finish breakfast.
      Just as the gig came to the door, Dr. May dismissed his last patient, rang the bell in haste,
      and as soon as prayers were over, declared he had an appointment,
      <pb n="63"/> and had no time to eat. There was a general outcry, that it was bad enough when
      he was well, and now he must not take liberties; Flora made him drink some tea; and Richard
      placed morsels in his way, while he read his letters. He ran up for a final look at Margaret,
      almost upset the staid Miss Winter as he ran down again, called Richard to take the reins, and
      was off.</p>
     <p>It was French day, always a trial to Ethel. M. Ballompré, the master, knew what was good and
      bad French, but could not render a reason, and Ethel, being versed in the principles of
      grammar, from her Latin studies, chose to know the why and wherefore of his corrections—she
      did not like to see her pages defaced, and have no security against future errors; while he
      thought her a troublesome pupil, and was put out by her questions. They wrangled, Miss Winter
      was displeased, and Ethel felt injured.</p>
     <p>Mary's inability to catch the pronunciation, and her hopeless dull look when she found that
       <hi>coeur</hi> must not be pronounced <hi>cour</hi> , nor <hi>cur</hi> , but something
      between, to which her rosy English lips could never come—all this did not tease M. Ballompré,
      for he was used to it.</p>
     <p>His mark for Ethel's lesson was ' <hi>de l' humeur</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'I am sorry,' said Miss Winter, when he was gone. 'I thought you had outgrown that habit of
      disputing over every phrase.'</p>
     <p>'I can't tell how a language is to be learnt without knowing the reasons of one's mistakes,'
      said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'That is what you always say, my dear. It is of no use to renew it all, but I wish you would
      control yourself. Now, Mary, call Blanche, and you and Ethel take your arithmetic.'</p>
     <p>So Flora went to read to Margaret, while Blanche went lightly and playfully through her easy
      lessons, and Mary floundered piteously over the difficulties of Compound Long Division.
      Ethel's mind was in too irritated and tumultuous a state for her to derive her usual solace
      from Cube Root. Her sum was wrong, and she wanted to work it right, but Miss Winter, who had
      little liking for the higher branches of arithmetic, said she had spent time enough over it,
      and summoned her to an examination such as the governess was very fond of and often practised.
      Ethel thought it useless, and was teased by it; and though her answers were chiefly correct,
      they were given in an irritated tone. It was of this kind:— What is the date of the invention
      of paper? What is the latitude and longitude of Otaheite? What are the component parts of
      brass? Whence is cochineal imported? </p>
     <p>When this was over, Ethel had to fetch her mending-basket, and Mary her book of selections;
      the piece for to-day's lessons was the quarrel of Brutus and Cassius; and Mary's dull droning
      tone was a
      <pb n="64"/> trial to her ears; she presently exclaimed, 'O Mary, don't murder it!'</p>
     <p>'Murder what?' said Mary, opening wide her light blue eyes.</p>
     <p>'That use of exaggerated language,'—began Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>'I've heard Papa say it,' said Ethel, only wanting to silence Miss Winter. In a cooler
      moment, she would not have used the argument.</p>
     <p>'All that a gentleman may say, may not be a precedent for a young lady; but you are
      interrupting Mary.'</p>
     <p>'Only let me show her. I can't bear to hear her, listen, Mary.</p>
     <p>'That is declaiming,' said Miss Winter. 'It is not what we wish for in a lady. You are
      neglecting your work and interfering.'</p>
     <p>Ethel made a fretful contortion, and obeyed. So it went on all the morning, Ethel's
      eagerness checked by Miss Winter's dry manner, producing pettishness, till Ethel, in a state
      between self-reproach and a sense of injustice, went up to prepare for dinner, and to visit
      Margaret on the way.</p>
     <p>She found her sister picking a merino frock to pieces. 'See here,' she said eagerly, 'I
      thought you would like to make up this old frock for one of the Cocksmoor children; but what
      is the matter?' as Ethel did not show the lively interest that she expected.</p>
     <p>'O nothing, only Miss Winter is so tiresome.'</p>
     <p>'What was it?'</p>
     <p>'Every thing, it was all horrid. I was cross I know, but she and M. Ballompré made me so;'
      and Ethel was in the midst of the narration of her grievances, when Norman came in. The school
      was half a mile off, but he had not once failed to come home, in the interval allowed for play
      after dinner, to inquire for his sister.</p>
     <p>'Well, Norman, you are out of breath, sit down and rest. What is doing at school? are you
       <hi>dux</hi> of your class?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, said the boy, wearily.</p>
     <p>'What mark for the verses?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p><hi>'Quam benè</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'Not <hi>optime?</hi> '</p>
     <p>'No, they were <hi>tame</hi> ,' Dr. Hoxton said.</p>
     <p>'What is Harry doing?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'He is fourth in his form. I left him at football.'</p>
     <p>'Dinner!' said Flora at the door. 'what will you have, Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'I'll fetch it,' said Norman, who considered it his privilege to wait on Margaret at dinner.
      When he had brought the tray, he stood leaning against the bed-post, musing. Suddenly, there
      was a considerable clatter of fire-irons, and his violent start surprised Margaret.</p>
     <pb n="65"/>
     <p>'Ethel has been poking the fire,' she said, as if no more was needed to account for their
      insecurity. Norman put them up again, but a ringing sound betrayed that it was not with a firm
      touch, and when, a minute after, he came to take her plate, she saw that he was trying with
      effort to steady his hand.</p>
     <p>'Norman, dear, are you sure you are well?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, very well,' said he, as if vexed that she had taken any notice.</p>
     <p>'You had better not come racing home. I'm not worth inquiries now, I am so much better,'
      said she, smiling.</p>
     <p>He made no reply, but this was not consenting silence.</p>
     <p>'I don't like you to lose your foot-ball,' she proceeded.</p>
     <p>'I could not—' and he stopped short.</p>
     <p>'It would be much better for you,' said she, looking up in his face with anxious
      affectionate eyes, but he shunned her glance and walked away with her plate.</p>
     <p>Flora had been in such close attendance upon Margaret, that she needed some cheerful walks,
      and though she had some doubts how affairs at home would go on without her, she was overruled,
      and sent on a long expedition with Miss Winter and Mary, while Ethel remained with
      Margaret.</p>
     <p>The only delay before setting out, was that nurse came in, saying, 'If you please, Miss
      Margaret, there is a girl come to see about the place.'</p>
     <p>The sisters looked at each other and smiled, while Margaret asked whence she came, and who
      she was.</p>
     <p>'Her name is Taylor, and she comes from Cocksmoor, but she is a nice tidy, strong-looking
      girl, and she says she has been used to children.'</p>
     <p>Nurse had fallen into the trap most comfortably, and seemed bent upon taking this girl as a
      choice of her own. She wished to know if Miss Margaret would like to see her.</p>
     <p>'If you please, nurse, but if you think she will do, that is enough.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, Miss, but you should look to them things yourself. If you please, I'll bring her up.'
      So nurse departed.</p>
     <p>'Charming!' cried Ethel, 'that's your capital management, Flora Nurse thinks she has done it
      all herself.</p>
     <p>'She is your charge though,' said Flora, 'coming from your own beloved Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>Lucy Taylor came in, looking very nice, and very shy, curtseying low, in extreme awe of the
      pale lady in bed. Margaret was much pleased with her, and there was no more to be done but to
      settle that she should come on Saturday, and to let nurse take her into the town to invest her
      with the universal blackness of the household, where the two Margarets were the only white
      things.</p>
     <pb n="66"/>
     <p>This arranged, and the walking party set forth, Ethel sat down by her sister's bed, and
      began to assist in unpicking the merino, telling Margaret how much obliged she was to her for
      thinking of it, and how grieved at having been so ungrateful in the morning. She was very
      happy over her contrivances, cutting out under her sister's superintendence. She had forgotten
      the morning's annoyance, till Margaret said, 'I have been thinking of what you said about Miss
      Winter, and really I don't know what is to be done.'</p>
     <p>'O Margaret, I did not mean to worry you,' said Ethel, sorry to see her look uneasy.</p>
     <p>'I like you to tell me every thing, dear Ethel; but I don't see clearly the best course. We
      must go on with Miss Winter.'</p>
     <p>'Of course,' said Ethel, shocked at her murmurs having even suggested the possibility of a
      change, and having, as well as all the others, a great respect and affection for her
      governess.</p>
     <p>'We could not get on without her, even if I were well,' continued Margaret; 'and dear mamma
      had such perfect trust in her, and we all know and love her so well—it would make us put up
      with a great deal.'</p>
     <p>'It is all my own fault,' said Ethel, only anxious to make amends to Miss Winter. 'I wish
      you would not say any thing about it.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, it does seem wrong even to think of it,' said Margaret, 'when she has been so very
      kind. It is a blessing to have any one to whom Mary and Blanche may so entirely be trusted.
      But for you—'</p>
     <p>'It is my own fault,' repeated Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I don't think it is quite all your own fault,' said Margaret, 'and that is the difficulty.
      I know dear mamma thought Miss Winter an excellent governess for the little ones, but hardly
      up to you, and she saw that you worried and fidgetted each other, so, you know, she used to
      keep the teaching of you a good deal in her own hands.'</p>
     <p>'I did not know that was the reason,' said Ethel, overpowered by the recollection of the
      happy morning's work she had often done in that very room, when her mother had not been equal
      to the bustle of the whole school-room. That watchful, protecting, guarding, mother's love, a
      shadow of Providence, had been round them so constantly on every side, that they had been
      hardly conscious of it till it was lost to them.</p>
     <p>'Was it not like her?' said Margaret, 'but now, my poor Ethel, I don't think it would be
      right by you or by Miss Winter, to take you out of the school-room. I think it would grieve
      her.'</p>
     <p>'I would not do that for the world.'</p>
     <p>'Especially after all her kind nursing of me, and even, with more reason, it would not be
      becoming in us to make changes. Besides,
      <pb n="67"/> King Etheldred,' said Margaret, smiling, 'we all know you are a little bit of a
      sloven, and, as nurse says, some one must be always after you, and do you know? even if I were
      well, I had rather it was Miss Winter than me.'</p>
     <p>'O no, you would not be formal and precise—you would not make me cross.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps you might make me so,' said Margaret, 'or I should let you alone, and leave you a
      slattern. We should both hate it so! No, don't make me your mistress, Ethel dear—let me be
      your sister and play-fellow still, as well as I can.'</p>
     <p>'You are, you are. I don't care half so much when I have got you.'</p>
     <p>'And will you try to bear with her, and remember it is right in the main, though it is
      troublesome?'</p>
     <p>'That I will. I wont plague you again. I know it is bad for you, you look tired.'</p>
     <p>'Pray don't leave off telling me,' said Margaret—'it is just what I wish on my own account,
      and I know it is comfortable to have a good grumble.'</p>
     <p>'If it does not hurt you, but I am sure you are not easy now— are you?'</p>
     <p>'Only my back,' said Margaret. 'I have been sitting up longer than usual, and it is tired.
      Will you call nurse to lay me flat again?'</p>
     <p>The nursery was deserted—all were out, and Ethel came back in trepidation at the notion of
      having to do it herself, though she knew it was only to put one arm to support her sister,
      while, with the other, she removed the pillows; but Ethel was conscious of her own awkwardness
      and want of observation, nor had Margaret entire trust in her. Still she was too much fatigued
      to wait, so Ethel was obliged to do her best. She was careful and frightened, and therefore
      slow and unsteady. She trusted that all was right, and Margaret tried to believe so, though
      still uneasy.</p>
     <p>Ethel began to read to her, and Dr. May came home. She looked up smiling, and asked where he
      had been, but it was vain to try to keep him from reading her face. He saw in an instant that
      something was amiss, and drew from her a confession that her back was aching a little. He knew
      she might have said a great deal—she was not in a comfortable position—she must be moved. She
      shook her head—she had rather wait—there was a dread of being again lifted by Ethel, that she
      could not entirely hide. Ethel was distressed, Dr. May was angry, and, no wonder, when he saw
      Margaret suffer, felt his own inability to help, missed her who had been wont to take all care
      from his hands, and was vexed to see a tall strong girl
      <pb n="68"/> of fifteen, with the full use of both arms, and plenty of sense, incapable of
      giving any assistance, and only doing harm by trying.</p>
     <p>'It is of no use,' said he. 'Ethel will give no attention to anything but her books! I've a
      great mind to put an end to all the Latin and Greek! She cares for nothing else.'</p>
     <p>Ethel could little brook injustice, and much as she was grieving, she exclaimed, 'Papa,
      papa, I do care—now don't I, Margaret? I did my best!'</p>
     <p>'Don't talk nonsense. Your best, indeed! If you had taken the most moderate care—'</p>
     <p>'I believe Ethel took rather too much care,' said Margaret, much more harrassed by the
      scolding than by the pain. 'It will be all right presently. Never mind, dear Papa.'</p>
     <p>But he was not only grieved for the present, but anxious for the future; and, though he knew
      it was bad for Margaret to manifest his displeasure, he could not restrain it, and continued
      to blame Ethel with enough of injustice to set her on vindication, whereupon he silenced her,
      by telling her she was making it worse by self-justification when Margaret ought to be quiet.
      Margaret tried to talk of other things, but was in too much discomfort to exert herself enough
      to divert his attention.</p>
     <p>At last Flora returned, and saw in an instant what was wanted. Margaret was settled in the
      right posture, but the pain would not immediately depart, and Dr. May soon found out that she
      had a head-ache, of which he knew he was at least as guilty as Etheldred could be.</p>
     <p>Nothing could be done but keep her quiet, and Ethel went away to be miserable; Flora tried
      to comfort her by saying it was unfortunate, but no doubt there was a knack, and every one
      could not manage those things; Margaret was easier now, and as to Papa's anger, he did not
      always mean all he said.</p>
     <p>But consolation came at bed-time; Margaret received her with open arms when she went to wish
      her good-night. 'My poor Ethel,' she said, holding her close, 'I am sorry I have made such a
      fuss.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, you did not, it was too bad of me—I am grieved; are you quite comfortable now?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, quite, only a little head-ache, which I shall sleep off. It has been so nice and
      quiet. Papa took up George Herbert, and has been reading me choice bits. I don't think I have
      enjoyed any thing so much since I have been ill.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad of that, but I have been unhappy all the evening. I wish I knew what to do. I am
      out of heart about every thing!'</p>
     <p>'Only try to mind and heed, and you will learn. It will be a
      <pb n="69"/> step if you will only put your shoes side by side when you take them off.'</p>
     <p>Ethel smiled and sighed, and Margaret whispered, 'Don't grieve about me, but put your clever
      head to rule your hands, and you will do for home and Cocksmoor too. Good-night, dearest.'</p>
     <p>'I've vexed papa,' sighed Ethel—and just then he came into the room.</p>
     <p>'Papa,' said Margaret, 'here's poor Ethel, not half recovered from her troubles.'</p>
     <p>He was now at ease about Margaret, and knew he had been harsh to another of his motherless
      girls.</p>
     <p>'Ah! we must send her to the infant-school, to learn "this is my right-hand, and this is my
      left,"' said he, in his half-gay, half-sad manner.</p>
     <p>'I was very stupid,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Poor child!' said her papa, 'she is worse off than I am. If I have but one hand left, she
      has two left-hands.'</p>
     <p>'I do mean to try, papa.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, you must, Ethel. I believe I was hasty with you, my poor girl. I was vexed, and we
      have no one to smooth us down. I am sorry, my dear, but you must bear with me, for I never
      learnt <hi>her</hi> ways with you when I might. We will try to have more patience with each
      other.'</p>
     <p>What could Ethel do but hang round his neck and cry, till he said, but tenderly, that they
      had given Margaret quite disturbance enough to-day, and sent her to bed, vowing to watch each
      little action, lest she should again give pain to such a father and sister.</p>

     <p>The misfortunes of that day disheartened and disconcerted Etheldred. To do mischief
      where she most wished to do good, to grieve where she longed to comfort, seemed to be her
      fate; it was vain to attempt any thing for any one's good, while all her warm feelings and
      high aspirations were thwarted by the awkward ungainly hands, and heedless eyes that Nature
      had given her. Nor did the following
      <pb n="70"/> day, Saturday, do much for her comfort, by giving her the company of her
      brothers. That it was Norman's sixteenth birth-day seemed only to make it worse. Their father
      had apparently forgotten it, and Norman stopped Blanche, when she was going to put him in mind
      of it; stopped her by such a look as the child never forgot, though there was no anger in it.
      In reply to Ethel's inquiry what he was going to do that morning, he gave a yawn and stretch,
      and said, dejectedly, that he had got some Euripides to look over, and some verses to
      finish.</p>
     <p>'I am sorry; this is the first time you ever have not managed so as to make a real holiday
      of your Saturday!'</p>
     <p>'I could not help it, and there's nothing to do,' said Norman, wearily.</p>
     <p>'I promised to go and read to Margaret, while Flora does her music,' said Ethel; 'I shall
      come after that and do my Latin and Greek with you.'</p>
     <p>Margaret would not keep her long, saying she liked her to be with Norman, but she found him
      with his head sunk on his open book, fast asleep. At dinner-time, Harry and Tom, rushing in,
      awoke him with a violent start.</p>
     <p>'Halloo! Norman, that was a jump!' said Harry, as his brother stretched and pinched himself.
      'You'll jump out of your skin some of these days, if you don't take care!'</p>
     <p>'It's enough to startle any one to be waked up with such a noise,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Then he ought to sleep at proper times,' said Harry, 'and not be waking me up with tumbling
      about, and hallooing out, and talking in his sleep half the night.'</p>
     <p>'Talking in his sleep; why, just now, you said he did not sleep,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Harry knows nothing about it,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Don't I? well, I only know, if you slept in school, and were a junior, you would get a
      proper good licking for going on as you do at night.'</p>
     <p>'And I think you might chance to get a proper good licking for not holding your tongue,'
      said Norman, which hint reduced Harry to silence.</p>
     <p>Dr. May was not come home; he had gone with Richard far into the country, and was to return
      to tea. He was thought to be desirous of avoiding the family dinners that used to be so
      delightful. Harry was impatient to depart, and when Mary and Tom ran after him, he ordered
      them back.</p>
     <p>'Where can he be going?' said Mary, as she looked wistfully after him.</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Tom.</p>
     <pb n="71"/>
     <p>'Where? Do tell me.'</p>
     <p>'Only don't tell papa. I went down with him to the play-ground this morning, and there they
      settled it. The Andersons, and Axworthy, and he, are going to hire a gun, and shoot pee-wits
      on Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'But they ought not; should they?' said Mary. 'Papa would be very angry.'</p>
     <p>'Anderson said there was no harm in it, but Harry told me not to tell. Indeed, Anderson
      would have boxed my ears for hearing, when I could not help it.'</p>
     <p>'But Harry would not let him?'</p>
     <p>'Aye. Harry is quite a match for Harvey Anderson, though he is so much younger; and he said
      he would not have me bullied.'</p>
     <p>'That's a good Harry! But I wish he would not go out shooting!' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Mind, you don't tell.'</p>
     <p>'And where's Hector Ernescliffe? Would not he go?'</p>
     <p>'No. I like Hector. He did not choose to go, though Anderson teazed him, and said he was a
      poor Scot, and his brother didn't allow him tin enough to buy powder and shot. If Harry would
      have stayed at home, he would have come up here, and we might have had some fun in the
      garden.'</p>
     <p>'I wish he would. We never have any fun now,' said Mary; 'but oh! there he is;' as she spied
      Hector peeping over the gate which led, from the field, into the garden. It was the first time
      that he had been to Dr. May's since his brother's departure, and he was rather shy, but the
      joyful welcome of Mary and Tom took off all reluctance, and they claimed him for a good game
      at play in the wood house. Mary ran up-stairs to beg to be excused the formal walk, and,
      luckily for her, Miss Winter was in Margaret's room. Margaret asked if it was very wet and
      dirty, and hearing 'not very,' gave gracious permission, and off went Mary and Blanche to
      construct some curious specimens of pottery, under the superintendence of Hector and Tom.
      There was a certain ditch where yellow mud was attainable, whereof the happy children
      concocted marbles and vases, which underwent a preparatory baking in the boys' pockets, that
      they might not crack in the nursery fire. Margaret only stipulated that her sisters should be
      well fenced in brown holland, and when Miss Winter looked grave, said, 'Poor things, a little
      thorough play will do them a great deal of good.'</p>
     <p>Miss Winter could not see the good of groping in the dirt; and Margaret perceived that it
      would be one of her difficulties to know how to follow out her mother's views for the
      children, without vexing the good governess by not deferring to her.</p>
     <pb n="72"/>
     <p>In the meantime, Norman had disconsolately returned to his Euripides, and Ethel, who wanted
      to stay with him and look out his words, was ordered out by Miss Winter, because she had spent
      all yesterday in-doors. Miss Winter was going to stay with Margaret, and Ethel and Flora
      coaxed Norman to come with them, 'just one mile on the turnpike road and back again; he would
      be much fresher for his Greek afterwards.'</p>
     <p>He came, but he did not enliven his sisters. The three plodded on, taking a diligent
      constitutional walk, exchanging very few words, and those chiefly between the girls. Flora
      gathered some hoary clematis, and red berries, and sought in the hedge-sides for some crimson
      'fairy baths' to carry home; and, at the sight of the amusement Margaret derived from the
      placing the beauteous little Pezizas in a saucer of damp green moss, so as to hide the brown
      sticks on which they grew, Ethel took shame to herself for want of perception of little
      attentions. When she told Norman so, he answered, 'There's no one who does see what is the
      right thing. How horrid the room looks! Every thing is no how!' added he, looking round at the
      ornaments and things on the tables, which had lost their air of comfort and good taste. It was
      not disorder, and Ethel could not see what he meant. 'What's wrong?' said she.</p>
     <p>'O never mind—you can't do it. Don't try—you'll only make it worse. It will never be the
      same as long as we live.'</p>
     <p>'I wish you would not be so unhappy!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Never mind,' again said Norman, but he put his arm round her.</p>
     <p>'Have you done your Euripides? Can I help you? Will you construe it with me, or shall I look
      out your words?'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, I don't mind that. It is the verses! I want some sense!' said Norman, running
      his fingers through his hair till it stood on end. ''Tis such a horrid subject, Coral Islands!
      As if there was any thing to be said about them.'</p>
     <p>'Dear me, Norman, I could say ten thousand things, only I must not tell you what mine are,
      as yours are not done.'</p>
     <p>'No, don't,' said, Norman, decidedly.</p>
     <p>'Did you read the description of them in the Quarterly? I am sure you might get some ideas
      there. Shall I find it for you? It is in an old number.'</p>
     <p>'Well, do; thank you—'</p>
     <p>He rested listlessly on the sofa while his sister rummaged in a chiffoniere. At last she
      found the article, and eagerly read him the description of the strange forms of the coral
      animals, and the beauties of their flower-like feelers and branching fabrics. It would once
      have delighted him, but his first comment was, 'Nasty little brutes!' However, the next minute
      he thanked her, took the book, and said
      <pb n="73"/> he could hammer something out of it, though it was too bad to give such an
      unclassical subject. At dusk he left off, saying he should get it done at night, his senses
      would come then, and he should be glad to sit up.</p>
     <p>'Only three weeks to the holidays,' said Ethel, trying to be cheerful; but his assent was
      depressing, and she began to fear that Christmas would only make them more sad.</p>
     <p>Mary did not keep Tom's secret so inviolably, but that, while they were dressing for tea,
      she revealed to Ethel where Harry was gone. He was not yet returned, though his father and
      Richard were come in, and the sisters were at once in some anxiety on his account, and doubt
      whether they ought to let papa know of his disobedience.</p>
     <p>Flora and Ethel, who were the first in the drawing-room, had a consultation.</p>
     <p>'I should have told mamma directly,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'He never did so,' sighed Ethel, 'things never went wrong then.'</p>
     <p>'O yes, they did; don't you remember how naughty Harry was about climbing the wall, and
      making faces at Mrs. Richardson's servants?'</p>
     <p>'And how ill I behaved the first day of last Christmas holidays?'</p>
     <p>'She knew, but I don't think she told papa.'</p>
     <p>'Not that we knew of, but I believe she did tell him everything, and I think, Flora, he
      ought to know everything, especially now, I never could bear the way the Mackenzies used to
      have of thinking their parents must be like enemies, and keeping secrets from them.'</p>
     <p>'They were always threatening each other, "I'll. tell mamma,"' said Flora, 'and calling us
      tell-tales because we told our own dear mamma everything. But it is not like that now—I
      neither like to worry papa, nor to bring Harry into disgrace—besides, Tom and Mary meant it
      for a secret.'</p>
     <p>'Papa would not be angry with him if we told him it was a secret,' said Ethel; 'I wish Harry
      would come in. There's the door—oh! it is only you.'</p>
     <p>'Whom did you expect?' said Richard, entering.</p>
     <p>The sisters looked at each other, and Ethel, after an interval, explained their doubts about
      Harry.</p>
     <p>'He is come in,' said Richard; 'I saw him running up to his own room, very muddy.'</p>
     <p>'O, I'm glad! But do you think papa ought to hear it? I don't know what's to be done. 'Tis
      the children's secret,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'It will never do to have him going out with those boys continually,' said Ethel—'Harvey
      Anderson close by all the holidays!'</p>
     <pb n="74"/>
     <p>'I'll try what I can do with him,' said Richard. 'Papa had better not hear it now, at any
      rate. He is very tired and sad this evening! and his arm is painful again, so we must not
      worry him with histories of naughtiness among the children.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Ethel, decidedly, 'I am glad you were there, Ritchie; I never should have thought
      of one time being better than another.'</p>
     <p>'Just like Ethel!' said Flora, smiling.</p>
     <p>'Why should not you learn?' said Richard gently.</p>
     <p>'I can't,' said Ethel, in a desponding way.</p>
     <p>'Why not? You are much sharper than most people, and, if you tried, you would know those
      things as much better than I do, as you know how to learn history.'</p>
     <p>'It is quite a different sort of cleverness,' said Flora. 'Recollect Sir Isaac Newton, or
      Archimedes.'</p>
     <p>'Then you must have both sorts,' said Ethel, 'for you can do things nicely, and yet you
      learn very fast.'</p>
     <p>'Take care, Ethel, you are singeing your frock! Well, I really don't think you can help
      those things!' said Flora. 'Your short sight is the reason of it, and it is of no use to try
      to mend it.'</p>
     <p>'Don't tell her so,' said Richard. 'It can't be all short sight— it is the not thinking. I
      do believe that if Ethel would think, no one would do things so well. Don't you remember the
      beautiful perspective drawing she made of this room, for me to take to Oxford? That was very
      difficult, and wanted a great deal of neatness and accuracy, so why should she not be neat and
      accurate in other things? And I know you can read faces, Ethel—why don't you look there before
      you speak?'</p>
     <p>'Ah! before instead of after, when I only see I have said something <hi>mal-à-propos</hi> ,
      said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I must go and see about the children,' said Flora; 'if the tea comes while I am gone, will
      you make it, Ritchie?'</p>
     <p>'Flora despairs of me,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I don't' said Richard. 'Have you forgotten how to put in a pin yet?'</p>
     <p>'No; I hope not.'</p>
     <p>'Well, then, see if you can't learn to make tea; and, by-the-by, Ethel, which is the next
      Christening Sunday?'</p>
     <p>'The one after next, surely. The first of December is Monday —yes, to-morrow week is the
      next.'</p>
     <p>'Then I have thought of something; it would cost eighteen-pence to hire Joliffe's
      spring-cart, and we might have Mrs. Taylor and the twins brought to Church in it. Should you
      like to walk to Cocksmoor and settle it?'</p>
     <pb n="75"/>
     <p>'O yes, very much indeed. What a capital thought. Margaret said you would know how to
      manage.'</p>
     <p>'Then we will go the first fine day papa does not want me.'</p>
     <p>'I wonder if I could finish my purple frocks. But here's the tea. Now, Richard, don't tell
      me to make it. I shall do something wrong, and Flora will never forgive you.'</p>
     <p>Richard would not let her off. He stood over her, counted her shovelsfull of tea, and
      watched the water into the tea-pot—he superintended her warming the cups, and putting a drop
      into each saucer. 'Ah!' said Ethel, with a concluding sigh, 'it makes one hotter than double
      equations!'</p>
     <p>It was all right, as Flora allowed with a slightly superior smile. She thought Richard would
      never succeed in making a notable or elegant woman of Ethel, and it was best that the two
      sisters should take different lines. Flora knew that, though clever and with more
      accomplishments, she could not surpass Ethel in intellectual attainments, but she was
      certainly far more valuable in the house, and had been proved to have just the qualities in
      which her sister was most deficient. She did not relish hearing that Ethel wanted nothing but
      attention to be more than her equal, and she thought Richard mistaken. Flora's remembrance of
      their time of distress was less unmixedly wretched than it was with the others, for she knew
      she had done wonders.</p>
     <p>The next day Norman told Ethel that he had got on very well with the verses, and finished
      them off late at night. He showed them to her before taking them to school on Monday morning,
      and Ethel thought they were the best he had ever written. There was too much spirit and
      poetical beauty, for a mere school-boy task, and she begged for the foul copy, to show it to
      her father. 'I have not got it,' said Norman. 'The foul copy was not like these; but when I
      was writing them out quite late, it was all, I don't know how. Flora's music was in my ears,
      and the room seemed to get larger, and like an ocean cave; and when the candle flickered,
      'twas like the green glowing light of the sun through the waves.'</p>
     <p>'As it says here,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And the words all came to me of themselves in beautiful flowing Latin, just right, as if it
      was any body but myself doing it, and they ran off my pen in red and blue and gold, and all
      sorts of colours; and fine branching zig-zagging stars, like what the book described, only
      stranger, came dancing and radiating round my pen and the candle. I could hardly believe the
      verses would scan by daylight, but I can't find a mistake. Do you try them again.'</p>
     <p>Ethel scanned. 'I see nothing wrong,' she said, 'but it seems
      <pb n="76"/> a shame to begin scanning Undine's verses, they are too pretty. I wish I could
      copy them. It must have been half a dream.'</p>
     <p>'I believe it was; they don't seem like my own.'</p>
     <p>'Did you dream afterwards?'</p>
     <p>He shivered. 'They had got into my head too much; my ears sang like the roaring of the sea,
      and I thought my feet were frozen on to an iceberg: then came darkness, and sea monsters, and
      drowning— it was too horrid!' and his face expressed all, and more than all, he said. 'But
      'tis a quarter to seven—we must go,' said he, with a long yawn, and rubbing his eyes. 'You are
      sure they are right, Ethel? Harry, come along.'</p>
     <p>Ethel thought those verses ought to make a sensation, but all that came of them was a
       <hi>Quam optimè</hi> , and when she asked Norman if no special notice had been taken of them,
      he said, in his languid way, 'No; only Dr. Hoxton said they were better than usual.'</p>
     <p>Ethel did not even have the satisfaction of hearing that Mr. Wilmot, happening to meet Dr.
      May, said to him, 'Your boy has more of a poet in him than any that has come in my way. He
      really sometimes makes very striking verses.'</p>
     <p>Richard watched for an opportunity of speaking to Harry, which did not at once occur, as the
      boy spent very little of his time at home, and, as if by tacit consent, he and Norman came in
      later every evening. At last, on Thursday, in the additional two hours' leisure allowed to the
      boys, when the studious prepared their tasks, and the idle had some special diversion, Richard
      encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a newly-invented instrument for projecting
      stones.</p>
     <p>'I'll walk back to school with you,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'I mean to run,' returned Harry.</p>
     <p>'Is there so much hurry?' said Richard. 'I am sorry for it, for I wanted to speak to you,
      Harry; I have something to show you.'</p>
     <p>His manner conveyed that it related to their mother, and the sobering effect was
      instantaneous. 'Very well,' said he, forgetting his haste. 'I'll come into your room.'</p>
     <p>The awe-struck, shy, yet sorrowful look on his rosy face, showed preparation enough, and
      Richard's only preface was to say, 'It is a bit of a letter that <hi>she</hi> was in course of
      writing to aunt Flora, a description of us all. The letter itself is gone, but here is a copy
      of it. I thought you would like to read what relates to yourself.'</p>
     <p>Richard laid before him the sheet of note paper on which this portion of the letter was
      written, and left him alone with it, while he set out on the promised walk with Ethel.</p>
     <p>They found the old woman, Granny Hall, looking like another
      <pb n="77"/> creature, smoke-dried and withered indeed, but all briskness and animation.</p>
     <p>'Well! be it you, Sir, and the young lady?'</p>
     <p>'Yes; here we are come to see you again,' said Richard. I hope you are not disappointed that
      I've brought my sister this time instead of the Doctor.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, Sir; I've done with the Doctor for this while,' said the old woman, to Ethel's
      great amusement. 'He have done me a power of good, and thank him for it heartily; but the
      young lady is right welcome here—but 'tis a dirty walk for her.'</p>
     <p>'Never mind that,' said Ethel, a little shyly, 'I came—where are your grandchildren?'</p>
     <p>'O somewhere out among the blocks. They gets out with the other children; I can't be always
      after them.'</p>
     <p>'I wanted to know if these would fit them,' said Ethel, beginning to undo her basket.</p>
     <p>'Well, 'pon my word! If ever I see! Here!' stepping out to the door, 'Polly—Jenny! come in,
      I say, this moment! Come in, ye bad girls, or I'll give you the stick; I'll break every bone
      of you, that I will!' all which threats were bawled out in such a good-natured, natured,
      triumphant voice, and with such a delighted air, that Richard and Ethel could not help
      laughing.</p>
     <p>After a few moments, Polly and Jenny made their appearance, extremely rough and ragged, but
      compelled by their grandmother to duck down, by way of courtesies, and, with finger in mouth,
      they stood, too shy to show their delight, as the garments were unfolded; Granny talking so
      fast that Ethel would never have brought in the stipulation, that the frocks should be worn to
      school and Church, if Richard, in his mild, but steady way, had not brought the old woman to
      listen to it. She was full of asseverations that they should go; she took them to Church
      sometimes herself, when it was fine weather and they had clothes, and they could say their
      catechiz as well anybody already; yes, they should come, that they should, and next Sunday.
      Ethel promised to be there to introduce them to the chief lady, the president of the
      Committee, Mrs. Ledwich, and, with a profusion of thanks, they took leave.</p>
     <p>They found John Taylor, just come out of the hospital, looking weak and ill, as he smoked
      his pipe over the fire, his wife bustling about at a great rate, and one of the infants
      crying. It seemed to be a great relief that they were not come to complain of Lucy, and there
      were many looks of surprise on hearing what their business really was. Mrs. Taylor thanked,
      and appeared not to know whether she was glad or sorry; and her husband, pipe in hand, gazed
      at the
      <pb n="78"/> young gentleman as if he did not comprehend the species, since he could not be
      old enough to be a Clergyman.</p>
     <p>Richard hoped they would find sponsors by that time; and there Mrs. Taylor gave little hope;
      it was a bad lot—there was no one she liked to ask to stand, she said, in a dismal voice; but
      there her husband put in, 'I'll find some one, if that's all; my missus always thinks nobody
      can't do nothing.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure,' said the lamentable Mrs. Taylor, 'all the elder ones was took to Church, and
      I'm loth the little ones shouldn't; but you see, Sir, we are poor people, and it's a long way,
      and they was set down in the gentleman's register book.'</p>
     <p>'But you know that is not the same, Mrs. Taylor. Surely Lucy could have told you that, when
      she went to school.'</p>
     <p>'No, sir, 'tis not the same—I knows that; but this is a bad place to live in—'</p>
     <p>'Always the old song, Missus!' exclaimed her husband. 'Thank you, kindly, Sir—you have been
      a good friend to us, and so was Dr. May, when I was up to the hospital, through the thick of
      his own troubles. I believe you are in the right of it, Sir, and thank you. The children shall
      be ready, and little Jack too, and I'll find gossips, and let 'em be Christened on
      Sunday.'</p>
     <p>'I believe you will be glad of it,' said Richard; and he went on to speak of the elder
      children coming to school, on Sunday, thus causing another whining from the wife about
      distance and bad weather, and no one else going that way. He said the little Halls were
      coming, but Mrs. Taylor began saying she disliked their company for the children—granny let
      them get about so much, and they said bad words. The father again interfered. Perhaps Mr.
      Wilmot, who acted as chaplain at the hospital, had been talking to him, for he declared at
      once that they should come; and Richard suggested that he might see them home when he came
      from Church; then, turning to the boy and girl, told them they would meet their sister Lucy,
      and asked them if they would not like that.</p>
     <p>On the whole, the beginning was not inauspicious, though there might be a doubt whether old
      Mrs. Hall would keep all her promises. Ethel was so much diverted and pleased as to be
      convinced she would; Richard was a little doubtful as to her power over the wild girls. There
      could not be any doubt that John Taylor was in earnest, and had been worked upon just at the
      right moment; but there was danger that the impression would not last. 'And his wife is such a
      horrible whining dawdle!' said Ethel—'there will be no good to be done if it depends on
      her.'</p>
     <p>Richard made no answer, and Ethel presently felt remorseful for
      <pb n="79"/> her harsh speech about a poor ignorant woman, overwhelmed with poverty, children,
      and weak health.</p>
     <p>'I have been thinking a great deal about what you said last time we took this walk,' said
      Richard, after a considerable interval.</p>
     <p>'O have you!' cried Ethel, eagerly; and the black peaty pond she was looking at, seemed to
      sparkle with sunlight.</p>
     <p>'Do you really mean it?' said Richard, deliberately.</p>
     <p>'Yes, to be sure;' she said, with some indignation.</p>
     <p>'Because I think I see a way to make a beginning, but you must make up you mind to a great
      deal of trouble, and dirty walks, and you must really learn not to draggle your frock.'</p>
     <p>'Well, well; but tell me.'</p>
     <p>'This is what I was thinking. I don't think I can go back to Oxford after Christmas. It is
      not fit to leave you while papa is so disabled.'</p>
     <p>'O no, he could not get on at all. I heard him tell Mr. Wilmot the other day that you were
      his right hand.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was glad she had repeated this, for there was a deepening colour and smiling glow of
      pleasure on her brother's face, such as she had seldom seen on his delicate, but somewhat
      impassive features.</p>
     <p>'He is very kind!' he said, warmly. 'No, I am sure I cannot be spared till he is better able
      to use his arm, and I don't see any chance of that just yet. Then if I stay at home, Friday is
      always at my own disposal, while papa is at the hospital meeting.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes, and we could go to Cocksmoor, and set up a school. How delightful!'</p>
     <p>'I don't think you would find it quite as delightful as you fancy,' said Richard; 'the
      children will be very wild and ignorant, and you don't like that at the National School.'</p>
     <p>'O but they are in such need, besides there will be no Mrs. Ledwich over me. It is just
      right,—I shan't mind anything. You are a capital Ritchie, for having thought of it!'</p>
     <p>'I don't think—if I am ever to be what I wish, that is, if I can get through at Oxford—I
      don't think it can be wrong to begin this, if Mr. Ramsden does not object.'</p>
     <p>'O Mr. Ramsden never objects to anything.'</p>
     <p>'And if Mr. Wilmot will come and set us off. You know we cannot begin without that, or
      without my father's fully liking it.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! there can be no doubt of that!'</p>
     <p>'This one thing, Ethel, I must stipulate. Don't you go and tell it all out at once to him. I
      cannot have him worried about our concerns.'</p>
     <p>'But how—no one can question that this is right. I am sure he won't object.'</p>
     <pb n="80"/>
     <p>'Stop, Ethel, don't you see, it can't be done for nothing? If we undertake it, we must go on
      with it, and when I am away, it will fall on you and Flora. Well, then, it ought to be
      considered whether you are old enough and steady enough; and if it can be managed for you to
      go continually all this way, in this wild place. There will be expense too.'</p>
     <p>Ethel looked wild with impatience, but could not gainsay these scruples, otherwise than by
      declaring they ought not to weigh against the good of Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>'It will worry him to have to consider all this,' said Richard, 'and it must not be pressed
      upon him.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Ethel, sorrowfully; 'but you don't mean to give it up.'</p>
     <p>'You are always in extremes, Ethel. All I want is to find a good time for proposing it.'</p>
     <p>She fidgetted and gave a long sigh.</p>
     <p>'Mind,' said Richard, stopping short, 'I'll have nothing to do with it except on condition
      you are patient, and hold your tongue about it.'</p>
     <p>'I think I can, if I may talk to Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'O yes, to Margaret of course. We could not settle anything without her help.'</p>
     <p>'And I know what she will say,' said Ethel. 'O I am so glad,' and she jumped over three
      puddles in succession.</p>
     <p>'And, Ethel, you must learn to keep your frock out of the dirt.'</p>
     <p>'I'll do anything, if you'll help me at Cocksmoor.'</p>

     <p>When Ethel came home, burning with the tidings of the newly-excited hopes for
      Cocksmoor, they were at once stopped by Margaret eagerly saying, 'Is Richard come in? pray
      call him;' then on his
      <pb n="81"/> entrance, 'O, Richard, would you be so kind as to take this to the Bank. I don't
      like to send it by any one else—it is so much;' and she took from under her pillows a velvet
      bag, so heavy, that it weighed down her slender white hand.</p>
     <p>'What, he has given you the care of his money?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes; I saw him turning something out of his waistcoat-pocket into the drawer of the
      looking-glass, and sighing in that very sad way. He said his fees had come to such an
      accumulation, that he must see about sending them to the Bank; and then he told me of the
      delight of throwing his first fee into dear mamma's lap, when they were just married, and his
      old uncle had given up to him, and how he had brought them to her ever since; he said she had
      spoiled him, by taking all trouble off his hands. He looked at it, as if it was so sorrowful
      to him to have to dispose of it, that I begged him not to plague himself any more, but let me
      see about it, as dear mamma used to do; so he said I was spoiling him too, but he brought me
      the drawer, and emptied it out here: when he was gone, I packed it up, and I have been waiting
      to ask Richard to take it all to the Bank, out of his sight.'</p>
     <p>'You counted it?' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Yes—there's fifty—I kept seventeen towards the week's expenses. Just see that it is right,'
      said Margaret, showing her neat packets.</p>
     <p>'Oh, Ritchie,' said Ethel, 'what can expense signify, when all that has been kicking about
      loose in an open drawer? What would not one of those rolls do?</p>
     <p>'I think I had better take them out of your way,' said Richard, quietly. 'Am I to bring back
      the book to you, Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, do,' said Margaret; 'pray do not teaze him with it.' And as her brother left the room,
      she continued, 'I wish he was better. I think he is more oppressed now than even at first. The
      pain of his arm, going on so long, seems to me to have pulled him down; it does not let him
      sleep, and, by the end of the day, he gets worn and fagged, by seeing so many people, and
      exerting himself to talk and think; and often, when there is something that must be asked, I
      don't know how to begin, for it seems as if a little more would be too much for him.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, Richard is right,' said Ethel, mournfully; 'it will not do to press him about our
      concerns; but do you think him worse to-day?'</p>
     <p>'He did not sleep last night, and he is always worse when he does not drive out into the
      country; the fresh air, and being alone with Richard, are a rest for him. To-day is especially
      trying; he does not think poor old Mr. Southern will get through the evening, and he is so
      sorry for the daughter.'</p>
     <pb n="82"/>
     <p>'Is he there now?'</p>
     <p>'Yes; he thought of something that might be an alleviation, and he would go, though he was
      tired. I am afraid the poor daughter will detain him, and he is not fit to go through such
      things now.'</p>
     <p>'No, I hope he will soon come; perhaps Richard will meet him. But, O Margaret, what do you
      think Richard and I have been talking of?' and, without perception of fit times and seasons,
      Ethel would have told her story, but Margaret, too anxious to attend to her, said, 'Hark! was
      not that his step?' and Dr. May came in, looking mournful and fatigued.</p>
     <p>'Well,' said he, 'I was just too late. He died as I got there, and I could not leave the
      daughter till old Mrs. Bowers came.'</p>
     <p>'Poor thing,' said Margaret. 'He was a good old man.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Dr. May, sitting wearily down, and speaking in a worn-out voice. 'One can't
      lightly part with a man one has seen at Church every Sunday of one's life, and exchanged so
      many friendly words with over his counter. 'Tis a strong bond of neighbourliness in a small
      place like this, and, as one grows old, changes come heavier—"the clouds return again after
      the rain." Thank you, my dear,' as Ethel fetched his slippers, and placed a stool for his
      feet, feeling somewhat ashamed of thinking it an achievement to have, unbidden, performed a
      small act of attention which would have come naturally from any of the others.</p>
     <p>'Papa, you will give me the treat of drinking tea with me?' said Margaret, who saw the quiet
      of her room would suit him better than the bustle of the children down stairs. 'Thank you,' as
      he gave a smile of assent.</p>
     <p>That Margaret could not be made to listen this evening was plain, and all that Ethel could
      do, was to search for some books on schools. In seeking for them, she displayed such confusion
      in the chiffoniere, that Flora exclaimed, 'Oh, Ethel, how could you leave it so?'</p>
     <p>'I was in a hurry, looking for something for Norman. I'll set it to rights,' said Ethel,
      gulping down her dislike to being reproved by Flora, with the thought that mamma would have
      said the same.</p>
     <p>'My dear!' cried Flora presently, jumping up, 'what are you doing? piling up those heavy
      books on the top of the little ones; how do you think they will ever stand? let me do it.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, Flora;' and Richard, in a low voice, gave Ethel some advice, which she received,
      seated on the floor, in a mood between temper and despair.</p>
     <p>'He is going to teach her to do it on the principles of gravitation,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>Richard did not do it himself, but, by his means Ethel, without being in the least
      irritated, gave the chiffoniere a thorough dusting
      <pb n="83"/> and setting-to-rights, sorting magazines, burning old catalogues, and finding her
      own long-lost 'Undine,' at which she was so delighted, that she would have forgotten all; in
      proceeding to read it, curled up on the floor amongst the heaps of pamphlets, if another
      gentle hint from Richard had not made her finish her task so well, as to make Flora declare it
      was a pleasure to look in, and Harry pronounce it to be all neat and ship-shape.</p>
     <p>There was no speaking to Margaret the next morning—it was French day—and Ethel had made
      strong resolutions to behave better; and whether there were fewer idioms, or that she was
      trying to understand, instead of carping at the master's explanations, they came to no battle;
      Flora led the conversation, and she sustained her part with credit, and gained an excellent
      mark.</p>
     <p>Flora said afterwards to Margaret, 'I managed nicely for her. I would not let M. Ballompré
      blunder upon any of the subjects Ethel feels too deeply to talk of in good French, and really
      Ethel has a great talent for languages. How fast she gets on with Italian!'</p>
     <p>'That she does,' said Margaret. 'Suppose you send her up, Flora—you must want to go and draw
      or practice, and she may do her arithmetic here, or read to me.'</p>
     <p>It was the second time Margaret had made this proposal, and it did not please Flora, who had
      learnt to think herself necessary to her sister, and liked to be the one to do everything for
      her. She was within six weeks of seventeen, and surely she need not be sent down again to the
      school-room, when she had been so good a manager of the whole family. She was fond of study
      and of accomplishments, but she thought she might be emancipated from Miss Winter; and it was
      not pleasant to her that a sister, only eighteen months older, and almost dependant on her,
      should have authority to dispose of her time.</p>
     <p>'I practise in the evening,' she said, 'and I could draw here, if I wished, but I have some
      music to copy.'</p>
     <p>Margaret was concerned at the dissatisfaction, though not understanding the whole of it;
      'You know, dear Flora,' she said,' 'I need not take up all your time now.'</p>
     <p>'Don't regret that,' said Flora. 'I like nothing so well as waiting on you, and I can attend
      to my own affairs very well here.'</p>
     <p>'I'll tell you why I proposed it,' said Margaret. 'I think it would be a relief to Ethel to
      escape from Miss Winter's beloved Friday questions.'</p>
     <p>'Great nonsense they are,' said Flora. 'Why don't you tell Miss Winter they are of no
      use?'</p>
     <p>'Mamma never interfered with them,' said Margaret. 'She only kept Ethel in her own hands,
      and if you would be so kind as to
      <pb n="84"/> change sometimes and sit in the school-room, we could spare Ethel, without
      hurting Miss Winter's feelings.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I'll call Ethel, if you like, but I shall go and practise in the drawing-room. The
      old school-room piano is fit for nothing but Mary to hammer upon.'</p>
     <p>Flora went away, evidently annoyed, and Margaret's conjectures on the cause of it, were cut
      short, by Ethel running in with a slate in one hand, and two books in the other, the rest
      having all tumbled down on the stairs.</p>
     <p>'O, Margaret, I am so glad to come to you. Miss Winter has set Mary to read "To be, or not
      to be," and it would have driven me distracted to have stayed there. I have got a most
      beautiful sum in Compound Proportion, about a lion, a wolf, and a bear eating up a carcase,
      and as soon as they have done it, you shall hear me say my ancient geography, and then we will
      do a nice bit of Tasso; and if we have any time after that, I have got such a thing to tell
      you—only I must not tell you now, or I shall go on talking and not finish my lessons.'</p>
     <p>It was not till all were done, that Ethel felt free to exclaim, 'Now for what I have been
      longing to tell you—Richard is going to—' But the fates were unpropitious. Aubrey trotted in,
      expecting to be amused; next came Norman, and Ethel gave up in despair; and, after having
      affronted Flora in the morning, Margaret was afraid of renewing the offence, by attempting to
      secure Ethel as her companion for the afternoon; so not till after the walk, could Margaret
      contrive to claim the promised communication, telling Ethel to come and settle herself cosily
      by her.</p>
     <p>'I should have been very glad of you last evening,' said she, 'for papa went to sleep, and
      my book was out of reach.'</p>
     <p>'O, I am sorry; how I pity you, poor Margaret!'</p>
     <p>'I suppose I have grown lazy,' said Margaret, 'for I don't mind those things now. I am never
      sorry for a quiet time to recollect and consider.'</p>
     <p>'It must be like the waiting in the dark between the slides of a magic lantern,' said Ethel;
      'I never like to be quiet. I get so unhappy.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad of resting and recollecting,' said Margaret. 'It has all been so like a dream,
      that merry morning, and then, slowly waking to find myself here in dear mamma's place, and
      papa, watching over me. Sometimes I think I have not half understood what it really is, and
      that I don't realize, that if I was up and about, I should find the house without her.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; that is the aching part!' said Ethel. 'I am happy, sitting on her bed here with you.
      You are a little of her, besides
      <pb n="85"/> being my own dear Peg-top! You are very lucky to miss the mealtimes and the
      evenings.'</p>
     <p>'That is the reason I don't feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting with me all the
      evening,' said Margaret, 'though it may make it worse for you to have him away. I don't think
      it selfish in me to keep him. He wants quiet so much, or to talk a little when it suits him;
      we are too many now, when he is tired.'</p>
     <p>'O, it is best,' said Ethel. 'Nothing that you do is selfish— dont talk of it,' dear
      Margaret. 'It will be something like old times when you come down again.'</p>
     <p>'But all this time you are not telling me what I want so much to hear,' said Margaret,
      'about Cocksmoor. I am so glad Richard has taken it up.'</p>
     <p>'That he has. We are to go every Friday, and hire a room, and teach the children. Once a
      week will do a great deal, if we can but make them wish to learn. It is a much better plan
      than mine; for if they care about it, they can come to school here on Sunday.'</p>
     <p>'It is excellent,' said Margaret, 'and if he is at home till Easter, it will give it a
      start, and put you in the way of it, and get you through the short days and dark evenings,
      when you could not so well walk home without him.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, and then we can all teach; Flora, and Mary, and you, when you are well again. Richard
      says it will be disagreeable, but I don't think so—they are such unsophisticated people. That
      Granny Hall is such a funny old woman; and the whole place wants nothing but a little care, to
      do very well.'</p>
     <p>'You must prepare for disappointments, dear Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'I know; I know nothing is done without draw-backs; but I am so glad to make some
      beginning.'</p>
     <p>'So am I. Do you know, mamma and I were one day talking over those kind of things, and she
      said she had always regretted that she had so many duties at home, that she could not attend
      as much to the poor as she would like; but she hoped now we girls were growing up, we should
      be able to do more.</p>
     <p>'Did she?' was all Ethel said, but she was deeply gratified.</p>
     <p>'I've been wanting to tell you. I knew you would like to hear it, It seems to set us to work
      so happily.'</p>
     <p>'I only wish we could begin,' said Ethel, 'but Richard is so slow! Of course we can't act
      without papa's consent and Mr. Wilmot's help, and he says papa must not be worried about it,
      and he must watch for his own time to speak about it.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I know—I would not have it otherwise; but what is tiresome is this. Richard is very good,
      but he is so dreadfully hard to stir up,
      <pb n="86"/> and what's worse, so very much afraid of papa, that while he is thinking about
      opportunities, they will all go by, and then it will be Easter, and nothing done!'</p>
     <p>'He is not so much afraid of papa as he was,' said Margaret. 'He has felt himself useful and
      a comfort, and papa is gentler; and that has cheered him out of the desponding way that kept
      him back from proposing anything.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps,' said Ethel; 'but I wish it was you. Can't you? you always know how to
      manage.'</p>
     <p>'No; it is Richard's affair, and he must do as he thinks fit. Don't sigh, dear Ethel—perhaps
      he may soon speak, and, if not, you can be preparing in a quiet way all the time. Don't you
      remember how dear mamma used to tell us that things, hastily begun, never turn out well?'</p>
     <p>'But this is not hasty. I've been thinking about it these six weeks,' said Ethel. 'If one
      does nothing but think, it is all no better than a vision. I want to be doing.'</p>
     <p>'Well, you can be doing—laying a sound foundation,' said Margaret. 'The more you consider,
      and the wiser you make yourself, the better it will be when you do set to work.'</p>
     <p>'You mean by curing myself of my slovenly ways, and impatient temper?'</p>
     <p>'I don't know that I was exactly thinking of that,' said Margaret, 'but that ought to be the
      way. If we are not just the thing in our niche at home, I don't think we can do much real good
      elsewhere.'</p>
     <p>'It would be hollow, show-goodness,' said Ethel. 'Yes, that is true; and it comes across me
      now, and then what a horrid wretch I am, to be wanting to undertake so much, when I leave so
      much undone. But, do you know, Margaret, there's no one such a help in those ways as Richard.
      Though he is so precise, he is never tiresome. He makes me see things, and do them neatly,
      without plaguing me, and putting me in a rage. I'm not ready to bite off my own fingers, or
      kick all the rattle-traps over and leave them, as I am, when Miss Winter scolds me, or nurse,
      or even Flora sometimes; but it is as if I was gratifying him, and his funny little old
      bachelor tidyisms divert me; besides, he teaches me the theory, and never lays hold of my poor
      fingers, and, when they won't bend the wrong way, calls them frogs.'</p>
     <p>'He is a capital master for you,' said Margaret, much amused and pleased, for Richard was
      her especial darling, and she triumphed in any eulogy from those who ordinarily were too apt
      to regard his dullness with superior compassion.</p>
     <p>'If he would only read our books, and enter into poetry and delight in it; but it is all
      nonsense to him,' said Ethel. 'I can't
      <pb n="87"/> think how people can be so different; but oh! here he comes. Ritchie, you should
      not come upon us before we are aware.'</p>
     <p>'What? I should have heard no good of myself?'</p>
     <p>'Great good,' said Margaret—'she was telling me you would make a neat-handed woman of her in
      time.'</p>
     <p>'I don't see why she should not be as neat as other people,' said Richard, gravely. 'Has she
      been telling you our plan?'</p>
     <p>And it was again happily discussed; Ethel, satisfied by finding him fully set upon the
      design, and Margaret, giving cordial sympathy and counsel. When Ethel was called away,
      Margaret said, 'I am so glad you have taken it up, not only for the sake of Cocksmoor, but of
      Ethel. It is good for her not to spend her high soul in dreams.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid she does not know what she undertakes,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'She does not; but you will keep her from being turned back. It is just the thing to prevent
      her energies from running to waste, and her being so much with you, and working under you, is
      exactly what one would have chosen.'</p>
     <p>'By contraries!' said Richard, smiling. 'That is what I was afraid of. I don't half
      understand or follow her, and when I think a thing nonsense, I see you all calling it very
      fine, and I don't know what to make of it—'</p>
     <p>'You are making yourself out more dull than you are,' said Margaret, affectionately.</p>
     <p>'I know I am stupid, and seem tame and cold,' said Richard, 'and you are the only one that
      does not care about it. That is what makes me wish Norman was the eldest. If I were as clever
      as he, I could do so much with Ethel, and be so much more to papa.'</p>
     <p>'No, you would not. You would have other things in your head. You would not be the dear,
      dear old Ritchie that you are. You would not be a calm, cautious, steady balance to the
      quicksilver heads some of us have got. No, no, Norman's a very fine fellow, a very dear
      fellow, but he would not do half so well for our eldest— he is too easily up, and down
      again.'</p>
     <p>'And I am getting into my old way of repining,' said Richard. 'I don't mind so much, since
      my father has at least one son to be proud of, and I can be of some use to him now.'</p>
     <p>'Of the greatest, and to all of us. I am so glad you can stay after Christmas, and papa was
      pleased at your offering, and said he could not spare you at all, though he would have tried,
      if it had been any real advantage to you.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I hope he will approve. I must speak to him as soon as I can find him with his mind
      tolerably disengaged.'</p>
     <pb n="88"/>
     <p>The scene that ensued that evening in the Magic Lantern before Margaret's bed, did not
      promise much for the freedom of her father's mind. Harry entered with a resolute manner.
      'Margaret, I wanted to speak to you,' said he, spreading himself out, with an elbow on each
      arm of the chair. 'I want you to speak to papa about my going to sea. It is high time to see
      about it—I shall be thirteen on the fourth of May.'</p>
     <p>'And you mean it seriously, Harry?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, of course I do, really and truly; and if it is to come to pass, it is time to take
      measures. Don't you see, Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'It is time, as you say,' answered Margaret, reflectingly, and sadly surveying the bright
      boy, rosy cheeked, round faced, and blue eyed, with the childish gladsomeness of countenance,
      that made it strange that his lot in life should be already in the balance.</p>
     <p>'I know what you will all tell me, that it is a hard life, but I must get my own living some
      way or other, and I should like that way the best,' said he, earnestly.</p>
     <p>'Should you like to be always far from home?'</p>
     <p>'I should come home sometimes, and bring such presents to Mary, and baby, and all of you;
      and I don't know what else to be, Margaret. I should hate to be a Doctor—I can't be abide sick
      people; and I couldn't write sermons, so I can't be a Clergyman; and I won't be a lawyer, I
      vow, for Harvey Anderson is to be a lawyer— so there's nothing left but soldiers and sailors,
      and I mean to be a sailor!'</p>
     <p>'Well, Harry, you may do your duty, and try to do right, if you are a sailor, and that is
      the point.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, I was sure you would not set your face against it, now you know Alan Ernescliffe.'</p>
     <p>'If you were to be like him—' Margaret found herself blushing, and broke off.</p>
     <p>'Then you will ask papa about it?'</p>
     <p>'You had better do so yourself. Boys had better settle such serious affairs with their
      fathers, without setting their sisters to interfere. What's the matter, Harry—you are not
      afraid to speak to papa?'</p>
     <p>'Only for one thing,' said Harry. 'Margaret, I went out to shoot pee-wits last Saturday with
      two fellows, and I can't speak to papa while that's on my mind.'</p>
     <p>'Then you had better tell him at once.'</p>
     <p>'I knew you would say so; but it would be like a girl, and it would be telling of the two
      fellows.'</p>
     <p>'Not at all; papa would not care about them.'</p>
     <p>'You see,' said Harry, twisting a little, 'I knew I ought not;
      <pb n="89"/> but they said I was afraid of a gun, and that I had no money. Now I see that was
      chaff, but I didn't then, and Norman wasn't there.'</p>
     <p>'I am so glad you have told me all this, Harry dear, for I knew you had been less at home of
      late, and I was almost afraid you were not going on quite well.'</p>
     <p>'That's what it is,' said Harry.' 'I can't stand things at all, and I can't go moping about
      as Norman does. I can't live without fun, and now Norman isn't there, half the time it turns
      to something I am sorry for afterwards.'</p>
     <p>'But, Harry, if you let yourself be drawn into mischief here for want of Norman, what would
      you do at sea?'</p>
     <p>'I should be an officer!'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid,' said Margaret, smiling, 'that would not make much difference inside, though
      it might outside. You must get the self-control, and leave off being afraid to be said to be
      afraid.'</p>
     <p>Harry fidgetted. 'I should start fresh, and be out of the way of the Andersons,' he said.
      'That Anderson junior, is a horrid fellow— he spites Norman, and he bullied me, till I was big
      enough to show him that it would not do—and though I am so much younger, he is afraid of me.
      He makes up to me, and tries to get me into all the mischief that is going.'</p>
     <p>'And you know that, and let him lead you? Oh, Harry!'</p>
     <p>'I don't let him lead me,' said Harry, indignantly, 'but I won't have them say I
       <hi>can't</hi> do things.'</p>
     <p>Margaret laughed, and Harry presently perceived what she meant, but instead of answering, he
      began to boast, 'There never was a May in disgrace yet, and there never shall be.'</p>
     <p>'That is a thing to be very thankful for,' said Margaret, 'but you know there may be much
      harm without public disgrace. I never heard of one of the Andersons being in disgrace
      yet.'</p>
     <p>'No—shabby fellows, that just manage to keep fair with old Hoxton, and make a show,' said
      Harry. 'They look at translations, and copy old stock verses. O, it was such fun the other
      day. What do you think? Norman must have been dreaming, for he had taken to school, by
      mistake, Richard's old Gradus that Ethel uses, and there were ever so many rough copies of
      hers sticking in it.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Ethel! What consternation she would be in! I hope no one found it out.'</p>
     <p>'Why, Anderson junior, was gaping about in despair for sense for his verses—he comes on
      that, and slyly copies a whole set of her old ones, done when she—Norman, I mean—was in the
      fifth form. His subject was a river, and hers Babylon; but, altering a line or two, it did
      just as well. He never guessed I saw him, and thought he had done it famously. He showed them
      up, and would have got
      <pb n="90"/> some noted good mark, but that, by great good luck, Ethel had made two of her
      pentameters too short, which he hadn't the wit to find out, thinking all Norman did must be
      right. So he has shown up a girl's verses—isn't that rare?' cried Harry, dancing on his chair
      with triumph.</p>
     <p>'I hope no one knows they were hers?'</p>
     <p>'Bless you, no!' said Harry, who regarded Ethel's attainments as something contraband. 'D'ye
      think I could tell? No, that's the only pity, that he can't hear it; but, after all, I don't
      care for anything he does, now I know he has shown up a girl's verses.'</p>
     <p>'Are these verses of poor Ethel's safe at home?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I took care of that. Mind you don't tell anyone, Margaret; I never told even
      Norman.'</p>
     <p>'But all your school-fellows arn't like these? You have Hector Ernescliffe.'</p>
     <p>'He's a nice fellow enough, but he is little, and down in the school. 'Twould be making a
      fourth form of myself to be after him. The fact is, Margaret, they are a low, ungentlemanly
      lot just now, about sixth and upper fifth form,' said Harry, lowering his voice into an
      anxious confidential tone; 'and since Norman has been less amongst them, they've got worse;
      and you see, now home is different, and he isn't like what he was, I'm thrown on them, and I
      want to get out of it. I didn't know that was it before, but Richard showed me what set me on
      thinking of it, and I see she knew all about it.'</p>
     <p>'That she did! There is a great deal in what you say, Harry, but you know she thought
      nothing would be of real use but changing within. If you don't get a root of strength in
      yourself, your ship will be no better to you than school—there will be idle midshipmen as well
      as idle school boys.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I know,' said Harry; 'but do you think papa will consent? She would not have
      minded.'</p>
     <p>'I can't tell. I should think he would; but if any scheme is to come to good, it must begin
      by your telling him of the going out shooting.'</p>
     <p>Harry sighed. 'I'd have done it long ago if she was here,' he said. 'I never did anything so
      bad before without telling, and I don't like it at all. It seems to come between him and me
      when I wish him good night.'</p>
     <p>'Then, Harry, pray do tell him. You'll have no comfort if you don't.'</p>
     <p>'I know I shan't; but then he'll be so angry! And, do you know, Margaret, 'twas worse than I
      told you, for a covey of partridges got up, and unluckily I had got the gun, and I fired and
      killed one, and that was regular poaching, you know! And when we heard
      <pb n="91"/> some one coming, how we did cut! Ax—the other fellow, I mean, got it, and cooked
      it in his bed-room, and ate it for supper; and he laughs about it, but I have felt so horrid
      all the week! Suppose a keeper had got a summons!'</p>
     <p>'I can only say again, the only peace will be in telling.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; but he will be so angry. When that lot of fellows a year or two ago, did something
      like it, and shot some of the Abbotstoke rabbits, don't you remember how much he said about
      its being disgraceful, and ordering us never to have anything to do with their gunnery? And he
      will think it so very bad to have gone out on a lark just now! O, I wish I hadn't done
      it.'</p>
     <p>'So do I, indeed, Harry! but I am sure, even if he should be angry at first, he will be
      pleased with your confessing.'</p>
     <p>Harry looked very reluctant and disconsolate, and his sister did not wonder—for Dr. May's
      way of hearing of a fault was never to be calculated on. 'Come, Harry,' said she, 'if he is
      ever so angry, though I don't think he will be, do you think that will be half as bad as this
      load at your heart? Besides, if you are not bold enough to speak to him, do you think you can
      ever be brave enough for a sailor?'</p>
     <p>'I will,' said Harry, and the words were hardly spoken, before his father's hand was on the
      door. He was taken by surprise at the moment of trial coming so speedily, and had half a mind
      to retreat by the other door; he was stayed by the reflection that Margaret would think him a
      coward, unfit for a sailor, and he made up his mind to endure whatever might betide.</p>
     <p>'Harry here? This is company I did not expect.'</p>
     <p>'Harry has something to say to you, papa.'</p>
     <p>'Eh! my boy, what is it?' said he, kindly.</p>
     <p>'Papa, I have killed a partridge. Two fellows got me to hire a gun, and go out shooting with
      them last Saturday,' said Harry, speaking firmly and boldly now he had once begun. 'We meant
      only to go after pee-wits, but a partridge got up, and I killed it.'</p>
     <p>Then came a pause. Harry stopped, and Dr. May waited, half expecting to hear that the boy
      was only brought to confession, by finding himself in a scrape. Margaret spoke. 'And he could
      not be happy till he had told you.'</p>
     <p>'Is it so? Is that the whole?' said the Doctor, looking at his son with a keen glance,
      between affection and inquiry, as if only waiting to be sure the confession was free, before
      he gave his free forgiveness.</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa,' said Harry, his voice and lip losing their firmness, as the sweetness of
      expression gained the day on his father's face.
      <pb n="92"/> 'Only that I know—'twas very wrong—especially now—and I am very sorry—and I beg
      your pardon.'</p>
     <p>The latter words came between sighs, fast becoming sobs, in spite of Harry's attempts to
      control them, as his father held out his arm, and drew him close to him. 'That's mamma's own
      brave boy,' he said in his ear—in a voice which strong feeling had reduced to such a whisper,
      that even Margaret could not hear—she only saw how Harry, sobbing aloud, clung tighter and
      tighter to him, till he said, 'Take care of my arm!' and Harry sprung back at least a yard,
      with such a look of dismay, that the Doctor laughed. 'No harm done!' said he. 'I was only a
      little in dread of such a young lion! Come back, Harry,' and he took his hand. 'It was a bad
      piece of work, and it will never do for you to let yourself be drawn into every bit of
      mischief that is on foot; I believe I ought to give you a good lecture on it, but I can't do
      it, after such a straightforward confession. You must have gone through enough in the last
      week, not to be likely to do it again.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa—thank you.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose I must not ask you any questions about it, for fear of betraying the fellows,'
      said Dr. May, half smiling.</p>
     <p>'Thank you, papa,' said Harry, infinitely relieved and grateful, and quite content for some
      space to lean in silence against the chair, with that encircling arm round him, while some
      talk passed between his father and Margaret.</p>
     <p>What a world of thought passed through the boy's young soul in that space! First, there was
      a thrill of intense, burning love to his father, scarcely less fondness to his sweet motherly
      sister; a clinging feeling to every chair and table of that room, which seemed still full of
      his mother's presence; a numbering over of all the others with ardent attachment, and a
      flinging from him with horror the notion of asking to be far away from that dearest father,
      that loving home, that arm that was round him. Anything rather than be without them in the
      dreary world! But then came the remembrance of cherished visions, the shame of relinquishing a
      settled purpose, the thought of weary morrows, with the tempters among his playmates, and his
      home blank and melancholy; and the roaming spirit of enterprise stirred again, and reproached
      him with being a baby, for fancying he could stay at home for ever. He would come back again
      with such honours as Alan Ernescliffe had brought, and oh! if his father so prized them in a
      stranger, what would it be in his own son? Come home to such a greeting as would make up for
      the parting! Harry's heart throbbed again for the boundless sea, the tall ship, and the
      wondrous foreign climes, where he had so often lived in fancy. Should he, could he
      <pb n="93"/> speak; was this the moment? and he stood gazing at the fire, oppressed with the
      weighty reality of deciding his destiny. At last Dr. May looked in his face, 'Well, what now,
      boy? You have your head full of something—what's coming next?'</p>
     <p>Out it came, 'Papa, will you let me be a sailor?'</p>
     <p>'Oh!' said Dr. May, 'that is come on again, is it? I thought that you had forgotten all
      that.'</p>
     <p>'No, Papa,' said Harry, with the manly coolness that the sense of his determination gave
      him—'it was not a mere fancy, and I have never had it out of my head. I mean it quite in
      earnest—I had rather be a sailor. I don't wish to get away from Latin and Greek, I don't mind
      them; but I think I could be a better sailor than anything. I know it is not all play, but I
      am willing to rough it; and I am getting so old, it is time to see about it, so will you
      consent to it, papa?'</p>
     <p>'Well! there's some sense in your way of putting it,' said Dr. May. 'You have it strong in
      your head then, and you know 'tis not all fair weather work!'</p>
     <p>'That I do; Alan told me histories, and I've read all about it; but one must rough it
      anywhere, and if I am ever so far away, I'll try not to forget what's right. I'll do my duty,
      and not care for danger.'</p>
     <p>'Well said, my man; but remember 'tis easier talking by one's own fire-side, than doing when
      the trial comes.'</p>
     <p>'And will you let me, papa?'</p>
     <p>'I'll think about it. I can't make up my mind as "quick as directly," you know, Harry,' said
      his father, smiling kindly, 'but I wont treat it as a boy's fancy, for you've spoken in a
      manly way, and deserve to be attended to.' 'Now run down, and tell the girls to put away their
      work, for I shall come down in a minute to read prayers.'</p>
     <p>Harry went, and his father sighed and mused! 'That's a fine fellow! So this is what comes of
      bringing sick sailors home—one's own boys must be catching the infection. Little monkey, he
      talks as wisely as if he were forty! He is really set on it, do you think, Margaret? I'm
      afraid so!'</p>
     <p>'I think so,' said Margaret; 'I don't think he ever has it out of his mind!'</p>
     <p>'And when the roving spirit once lays hold of a lad, he must have his way—he is good for
      nothing else,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I suppose a man may keep from evil in that profession, as well as in any other,' said
      Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Aha! you are bit too, are you?' said the Doctor; 'tis the husbandman and viper, is it? Then
      his smile turned into a heavy sigh,
      <pb n="94"/> as he saw he had brought colour to Margaret's pale cheek,' but she answered
      calmly, 'Dear mamma did not think it would be a bad thing for him.'</p>
     <p>'I know,' said the Doctor, pausing; 'but it never came to this with her.'</p>
     <p>'I wish he had chosen something else; but'—and Margaret thought it right to lay before her
      father some part of what he had said of the temptations of the school at Stoneborough. The
      Doctor listened and considered; at last he rose, and said, 'Well, I'll set Ritchie to write to
      Ernescliffe, and hear what he says. What must be, must be. 'Tis only asking me to give up the
      boy, that's all;' and as he left the room, his daughter again heard his sigh and half-uttered
      words, 'O Maggie, Maggie.'</p>

     <p>Etheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the Taylors at school on Sunday, but no
      Halls made their appearance, and, on inquiry, she was told, 'Please ma'am, they said they
      would not come;' so Ethel condemned Granny Hall as 'a horrid, vile, false, hypocritical old
      creature! It was no use having any thing more to do with her.'</p>
     <p>'Very well,' said Richard; 'then I need not speak to my father.'</p>
     <p>'Ritchie now! you know I meant no such thing!'</p>
     <p>'You know, it is just what will happen continually.'</p>
     <p>'Of course there will be failures, but this is so abominable, when they had those nice
      frocks, and those two beautiful eighteen-penny shawls! There are three shillings out of my
      pound thrown away!'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps there was some reason to prevent them. We will go and see.'</p>
     <p>'We shall only hear some more palavering. I want to have no more to say to—' but here Ethel
      caught herself up, and began to perceive what a happiness it was that she had not the power of
      acting on her own impulses.</p>
     <p>The twins and their little brother of two years old were Christened in the afternoon, and
      Flora invited the parents to drink tea in the kitchen, and visit Lucy, while Ethel and Mary
      each carried a baby up-stairs to exhibit to Margaret.</p>
     <p>Richard, in the meantime, had a conversation with John Taylor,
      <pb n="95"/> and learnt a good deal about the district, and the number of the people. At tea,
      he began to rehearse his information, and the Doctor listened with interest, which put Ethel
      in happy agitation, believing that the moment was come, and Richard seemed to be only waiting
      for the conclusion of a long tirade against those who ought to do something for the place,
      when behold! Blanche was climbing on her father's knee, begging for one of his Sunday
      stories.</p>
     <p>Etheldred was cruelly disappointed, and could not at first rejoice to see her father able
      again to occupy himself with his little girl. The narration, in his low tones, roused her from
      her mood of vexaation. It was the story of David, which he told in language scriptural and
      poetical, so pretty and tender in its simplicity, that she could not choose but attend. Ever
      and anon there was a glance towards Harry, as if he were secretly likening his own 'yellow
      haired laddie' to the 'shepherd boy, ruddy, and of a fair countenance.'</p>
     <p>'So Tom and Blanche,' he concluded, 'can you tell me how we may be like the shepherd-boy,
      David?'</p>
     <p>'There arn't giants now,' said Tom.</p>
     <p>'Wrong is a giant,' said his little sister.</p>
     <p>'Right, my white May-flower, and what then?'</p>
     <p>'We are to fight,' said Tom.</p>
     <p>'Yes, and mind, the giant with all his armour may be some great thing we have to do: but
      what did David begin with when he was younger?'</p>
     <p>'The lion and the bear.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, and minding his sheep. Perhaps little things, now you are little children, may be like
      the lion and the bear—so kill them off—get rid of them—cure yourself of whining or dawdling,
      or whatever it be, and mind your sheep well,' said he, smiling sweetly in answer to the
      children's earnest looks as they caught his meaning, and if you do, you will not find it near
      so hard to deal with your great giant struggle when it comes.'</p>
     <p>Ah! thought Ethel, it suits me as well as the children. I have a great giant on Cocksmoor,
      and here I am, not allowed to attack him, because, perhaps, I am not minding my sheep, and
      letting my lion and my bear run loose about the house.</p>
     <p>She was less impatient this week, partly from the sense of being on probation, and partly
      because she, in common with all the rest, was much engrossed with Harry's fate. He came home
      every day at dinner-time with Norman to ask if Alan Ernescliffe's letter had come; and at
      length Mary and Tom met them open-mouthed with the news that Margaret had it in her room.</p>
     <p>Thither they hastened. Margaret held it out with a smile of congratulation. 'Here it is,
      Harry; papa said you were to have it,
      <pb n="96"/> and consider it well, and let him know, when you had taken time. You must do it
      soberly. It is once for all.'</p>
     <p>Harry's impetuosity was checked, and he took the letter quietly. His sister put her hand on
      his shoulder, 'Would you mind my kissing you, dear Harry?' and as he threw his arms round her
      neck, she whispered, 'Pray that you may choose right.'</p>
     <p>He went quietly away, and Norman begged to know what had been Alan Ernescliffe's advice.</p>
     <p>'I can scarcely say he gave any direct advice,' said Margaret; 'he would not have thought
      that called for. He said, no doubt there were hardships and temptations, more or less,
      according to circumstances; but, weighing one thing with another, he thought it gave as fair a
      chance of happiness as other professions, and the discipline and regularity had been very good
      for himself, as well as for many others he had known. He said, when a man is willing to go
      wrong there is much to help him, but when he is resolved on doing right, he need not be
      prevented.'</p>
     <p>'That is what you may say of anything,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Just so; and it answered papa's question, whether it was exposing Harry to more temptation
      than he must meet with anywhere. That was the reason it was such a comfort to have anyone to
      write to, who understands it so well.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, and knows Harry's nature.'</p>
     <p>'He said he had been fortunate in his captains, and had led, on the whole, a happy life at
      sea; and he thought if it was so with him, Harry was likely to enjoy it more, being of a hardy
      adventurous nature, and a sailor from choice, not from circumstances.'</p>
     <p>'Then he advised for it? I did not think he would; you know he will not let Hector be a
      sailor.'</p>
     <p>'He told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it desirable, and that he
      believed Hector only wished it from imitation of him. He said too, long ago, that he thought
      Harry cut out for a sailor.'</p>
     <p>'A spirited fellow!' said Norman, with a look of saddened pride and approval, not at all
      like one so near the same age. 'He is up to anything, afraid of nothing, he can lick any boy
      in the school already. It will be worse than ever without him!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, you will miss your constant follower. He has been your shadow ever since he could
      walk. But there's the clock, I must not keep you any longer; good-bye, Norman.'</p>
     <p>Harry gave his brother the letter as soon as they were outside the house, and while he read
      it, took his arm and guided him. 'Well,' said Norman as he finished.</p>
     <p>'It is all right,' said Harry; and the two brothers said no more;
      <pb n="97"/> there was something rising up in their throats at the thought that they had very
      few more walks to take together to Bishop Whichcote's school; Norman's heart was very full at
      the prospect of another vacancy in his home, and Harry's was swelling between the ardour of
      enterprise and the thought of bidding good-bye to each familiar object, and, above all, to the
      brother who had been his model and admiration from babyhood.</p>
     <p>'June!' at length he broke out, 'I wish you were going too. I should not mind it half so
      much if you were.'</p>
     <p>'Nonsense, Harry! you want to be July after June all your life, do you? You'll be much more
      of a man without me.'</p>
     <p>That evening Dr. May called Harry into his study to ask him if his mind was made up; he put
      the subject fairly before him, and told him not to be deterred from choosing what he thought
      would be for the best by any scruples about changing his mind. 'We shall not think a bit the
      worse of you; better now, than too late.'</p>
     <p>There was that in his face and tone that caused Harry to say, in a stifled voice, 'I did not
      think you would care so much, papa; I won't go, if you do.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May put his hand on his shoulder, and was silent. Harry felt a strange mixture of hope
      and fear, joy and grief, disappointment and relief. 'You must not give it up on that account,
      my dear,' he said at length; 'I should not let you see this, if it did not happen at a time
      when I can't command myself as I ought. If you were an only son, it might be your duty to
      stay; being one of many, 'tis nonsense to make a rout about parting with you. If it is better
      for you, it is better for all of us; and we shall do very well when you are once fairly gone.
      Don't let <hi>that</hi> influence you for a moment.'</p>
     <p>Harry paused, not that he doubted, but he was collecting his energies—'Then, papa, I choose
      the Navy.'</p>
     <p>'Then it is done, Harry. You have chosen in a dutiful, unselfish spirit, and I trust it will
      prosper with you; for I am sure your father's blessing—aye, and your mother's too, go with
      you! Now then,' after a pause, 'go and call Richard. I want him to write to Ernescliffe about
      that naval school. You must take your leave of the Whichcote foundation on Friday. I shall go
      and give Dr. Hoxton notice tomorrow, and get Tom's name down instead.'</p>
     <p>And when the name of Thomas May was set down, Dr. Hoxton expressed his trust that it would
      pass through the school as free from the slightest blemish as those of Richard, Norman, and
      Harry May.</p>
     <p>Now that Harry's destiny was fixed, Ethel began to think of Cocksmoor again, and she
      accomplished another walk there with Richard, Flora, and Mary, to question Granny Hall about
      the children's failure.</p>
     <pb n="98"/>
     <p>The old woman's reply was a tissue of contradictions: the girls were idle hussies, all
       <hi>contrary:</hi> they plagued the very life out of her, and she represented herself as
      using the most frightful threats, if they would not go to school. Breaking every bone in their
      skin was the least injury she promised them; till Mary, beginning to think her a cruel old
      woman, took hold of her brother's coat-tails for protection.</p>
     <p>'But I am afraid, Mrs. Hall,' said Richard, in that tone which might be either ironical or
      simple, 'if you served them so, they would never be able to get to school at all, poor
      things.'</p>
     <p>'Bless you, Sir, d'ye think I'd ever lay a finger near them; it's only the way one must talk
      to children, you see,' said she, patronizing his inexperience.</p>
     <p>'Perhaps they have found that out,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>Granny looked much entertained, and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly, 'aye, aye, that they
      have, the lasses—they be sharp enough for anything, <hi>that</hi> they be. Why, when I tell
      little Jenny that there's the black man coming after her, what does she do but she ups and
      says, 'Granny, I know 'tis only the wind in the chimney.'</p>
     <p>'Then I don't think it seems to answer,' said Richard. 'Just suppose you were to try for
      once, really punishing them when they won't obey you, perhaps they would do it next time.'</p>
     <p>'Why, Sir, you see I don't like to take the stick to them; they've got no mother, you see,
      Sir.'</p>
     <p>Mary thought her a kind grandmother, and came out from behind her brother.</p>
     <p>'I think it would be kinder to do it for once. What do you think they will do as they grow
      older, if you don't keep them in order when they are little?'</p>
     <p>This was foresight beyond Granny Hall, who began to expatiate on the troubles she had
      undergone in their service, and the excellence of Sam. There was certainly a charm in her
      manners, for Ethel forgot her charge of ingratitude, the other sisters were perfectly taken
      with her, nor could they any of them help giving credence to her asseverations that Jenny and
      Polly should come to school next Sunday.</p>
     <p>They soon formed another acquaintance; a sharp-faced woman stood in their path, with a
      little girl in her hand, and arrested them with a low curtsey, and not a very pleasant voice,
      addressing herself to Flora, who was quite as tall as Richard, and appeared the person of most
      consequence.</p>
     <p>'If you please, Miss, I wanted to speak to you. I have got a little girl here, and I want to
      send her to school, only I have no shoes for her.'</p>
     <p>'Why surely, if she can run about here on the heath, she can go to school,' said Flora.</p>
     <pb n="99"/>
     <p>'Oh! but there is all the other children to point at her. The poor thing would be daunted,
      you see, Miss; if I could but get some friend to give her a pair of shoes, I'd send her in a
      minute. I want her to get some learning; as I am always saying, I'd never keep her away, if I
      had but got the clothes to send her in. I never lets her be running on the common, like them
      Halls, as it's a shame to see them in nice frocks, as Mrs. Hall got by going hypercriting
      about.'</p>
     <p>'What is your name?' said Richard, cutting her short.</p>
     <p>'Watts, if you please, Sir; we heard there was good work up here, Sir, and so we came; but
      I'd never have set foot in it if I had known what a dark heathenish place it is, with never a
      Gospel minister to come near it,' and a great deal more to the same purpose.</p>
     <p>Mary whispered to Flora something about having out-grown her boots, but Flora silenced her
      by a squeeze of the hand, and the two friends of Cocksmoor felt a good deal puzzled.</p>
     <p>At last Flora said, 'You will soon get her clothed if she comes regularly to school on
      Sundays, for she will be admitted into the club; I will recommend her if she has a good
      character and comes regularly. Good morning, Mrs. Watts. Now we must go, or it will be dark
      before we get home.' And they walked hastily away.</p>
     <p>'Horrid woman!' was Ethel's exclamation.</p>
     <p>'But, Flora,' said innocent Mary, 'why would you not let me give the little girl my
      boots?'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps I may, if she is good and comes to school,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I think Margaret ought to settle what you do with your boots,' said Richard, not much to
      Flora's satisfaction.</p>
     <p>'It is all the same,' she said. 'If I approve, Margaret will not object.'</p>
     <p>'How well you helped us out, Flora,' said Ethel; 'I did not know in the least what to
      say.'</p>
     <p>'It will be the best way of testing her sincerity,' said Flora, 'and at least it will do the
      child good; but I congratulate you on the promising aspect of Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'We did not expect to find a perfect place,' said Ethel; 'if it were, it would be of no use
      to go to it.'</p>
     <p>Ethel could answer with dignity, but her heart sank at the aspect of what she had
      undertaken. She knew there would be evil, but she had expected it in a more striking and less
      disagreeable form.</p>
     <p>That walk certainly made her less impatient, though it did not relax her determination, nor
      the guard over her lion and bear, which her own good feeling, aided by Margaret's counsel,
      showed her were the greatest hindrances to her doing anything good and great.</p>
     <p>Though she was obliged to set to work so many principles and
      <pb n="100"/> reflections to induce herself to wipe a pen, or to sit straight on her chair,
      that it was like winding up a steam-engine to thread a needle; yet the work <hi>was</hi> being
      done—she was struggling with her faults, humbled by them, watching them, and overcoming
      them.</p>
     <p>Flora, meanwhile, was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the unexpected services
      she had rendered, confident that her character for energy and excellence was established,
      believing it herself, and looking back on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long
      past and conquered. She thought her grown-up character had begun, and was too secure to
      examine it closely.</p>

     <p>Hopes that Dr. May would ever have his mind free, seemed as fallacious as mamma's
      old promise to Margaret, to make doll's clothes for her whenever there should be no live dolls
      to be worked for in the nursery.</p>
     <p>Richard and Ethel themselves had their thoughts otherwise engrossed. The last week before
      the holidays was an important one. There was an examination, by which the standing of the boys
      in the school was determined, and this time it was of more than ordinary importance, as the
      Randall scholarship of £100 a year for three years would be open in the summer to the
      competition of the first six boys. Richard had never come within six of the top, but had been
      past at every examination by younger boys, till his father could bear it no longer; and now
      Norman was too young to be likely to have much chance of being of the number. There were eight
      decidedly his seniors, and Harvey Anderson, a small, quick-witted boy, half a year older, who
      had entered school at the same time, and had always been one step below him, had, in the last
      three months, gained fast upon him.</p>
     <p>Harry, however, meant Norman to be one of the six, and declared all the fellows thought he
      would be, except Anderson's party. Mr. Wilmot, in a call on Ethel and Flora, told them that he
      thought their brother had a fair chance, but he feared he was over-working himself, and should
      tell the Doctor so, whenever he could catch him; but this was difficult, as there was a great
      deal of illness just then, and he was less at home than usual.</p>
     <pb n="101"/>
     <p>All this excited the home party, but Norman only seemed annoyed by talk about it, and though
      always with a book in his hand, was so dreamy and listless, that Flora declared there was no
      fear of his doing too much—she thought he would fail for want of trying.</p>
     <p>'I mean to try,' said Norman; 'say no more about it, pray.'</p>
     <p>The great day was the 20th of December, and Ethel ran out, as the boys went to school, to
      judge of Norman's looks, which were not promising. 'No wonder,' said Harry, since he had
      stayed up doing Euripides and Cicero the whole length of a candle that had been new at
      bed-time. 'But never mind, Ethel, if he only beats Anderson, I don't care for anything
      else.'</p>
     <p>'O, it will be unbearable if he does not! Do try, Norman, dear.'</p>
     <p>'Never you mind.'</p>
     <p>'He'll light up at the last moment,' said Ethel, consolingly, to Harry; but she was very
      uneasy herself, for she had set her heart on his surpassing Harvey Anderson. No more was heard
      all day. Tom went at dinner-time to see if he could pick up any news; but he was shy, or was
      too late, and gained no intelligence. Dr. May and Richard talked of going to hear the speeches
      and <hi>vivâ voce</hi> examination in the afternoon—objects of great interest to all
      Stoneborough men—but just as they came home from a long day's work, Dr. May was summoned to
      the next town, by an electric telegraph, and, as it was to a bad case, he did not expect to be
      at home till the mail-train came in at one o'clock at night. Richard begged to go with him,
      and he consented, unwillingly, to please Margaret, who could not bear to think of his 'fending
      for himself' in the dark on the rail-road.</p>
     <p>Very long did the evening seem to the listening sisters. Eight, and no tidings; nine, the
      boys not come; Tom obliged to go to bed by sheer sleepiness, and Ethel unable to sit still,
      and causing Flora demurely to wonder at her fidgetting so much, it would be so much better to
      fix her attention to some employment; while Margaret owned that Flora was right, but watched,
      and started at each sound, almost as anxiously as Ethel.</p>
     <p>It was ten, when there was a sharp pull at the bell, and down flew the sisters; but old
      James was beforehand, and Harry was exclaiming, 'Dux! James, he is Dux! Hurrah! Flossy, Ethel,
      Mary! There stands the Dux of Stoneborough! Where's papa?'</p>
     <p>'Sent for to Whitford. But oh! Norman, Dux! Is he really?'</p>
     <p>'To be sure, but I must tell Margaret;' and up he rushed, shouted the news to her, but could
      not stay for congratulation; broke Tom's slumber by roaring it in his ear, and dashed into the
      nursery, where nurse for once forgave him for waking the baby.
      <pb n="102"/> Norman, meanwhile, followed his eager sister into the drawing-room, putting up
      his hand as if the light dazzled him, and looking, by no means, as if he had just achieved
      triumphant success.</p>
     <p>Ethel paused in her exultation: 'But is it, is it true, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' he said, wearily, making his way to his dark corner.</p>
     <p>'But what was it for? How is it?'</p>
     <p>'I don't know,' he answered.</p>
     <p>'What's the matter?' said Flora. 'Are you tired, Norman, dear; does your head ache?'</p>
     <p>'Yes;' and the pain was evidently severe.</p>
     <p>'Won't you come to Margaret?' said Ethel, knowing what was the greater suffering; but he did
      not move, and they forbore to torment him with questions. The next moment Harry came down in
      an ecstacy, bringing in, from the hall, Norman's beautiful prize books, and showing off their
      Latin inscription.</p>
     <p>'Ah!' said he, looking at his brother, 'he is regularly done for. He ought to turn in at
      once. That Everard is a famous fellow for an examiner. He said he never had seen such a copy
      of verses sent up by a school-boy, and could hardly believe June was barely sixteen. Old
      Hoxton says he is the youngest Dux they have had these fifty years that he has known the
      school, and Mr. Wilmot said 'twas the most creditable examination he had ever known, and that
      I might tell papa so. What did possess that ridiculous old landlubber at Whitford, to go and
      get on the sick-list on this, of all the nights of the year? June, how can you go on sitting
      there, when you know you ought to be in your berth?'</p>
     <p>'I wish he was,' said Flora, 'but let him have some tea first.'</p>
     <p>'And tell us more, Harry,' said Ethel. 'Oh! it is famous! I knew he would come right at
      last. It is too delightful, if papa was but here!'</p>
     <p>'Isn't it? You should have seen how Anderson grinned—he is only fourth—down below Forder,
      and Cheviot, and Ashe.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I did not think Norman would have been before Forder and Cheviot. That is grand.'</p>
     <p>'It was the verses that did it,' said Harry; they had an hour to do Themistocles on the
      hearth of Admetus, and there he beat them all to shivers. 'Twas all done smack; smooth,
      without a scratch, in Alcaics, and Cheviot heard Wilmot saying, 'twas no mere task, but had
      poetry, and all that sort of thing in it. But I don't know whether that would have done, if he
      had not come out so strong in the recitation; they put him on in Priam's speech to Achilles,
      and he said it—Oh! 'twas too bad papa did not hear him! Everyone held their breath and
      listened.'</p>
     <p>'How you do go on!' muttered Norman; but no one heeded,
      <pb n="103"/> and Harry continued: 'He construed a chorus in Sophocles without a blunder; but
      what did the business was this, I believe. They asked all manner of out-of-the-way
      questions—history and geography, what no one expected, and the fellows who read nothing they
      can help, were thoroughly posed. Forder had not a word to say, and the others were worse, for
      Cheviot thought Queen Elizabeth's Earl of Leicester was Simon de Montfort; and didn't know
      when that battle was, beginning with an E.—was it Evesham, or Edgehill?'</p>
     <p>'O Harry, you are as bad yourself?'</p>
     <p>'But anyone would know Leicester, because of Kenilworth,' said Harry; 'and I'm not sixth
      form. If papa had but been there! Everyone was asking for him, and wishing it. For Dr. Hoxton
      called me—they shook hands with me, and wished me joy of it, and told me to tell my father how
      well Norman had done.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose you looked so happy, they could not help it,' said Flora, smiling at that honest
      beaming face of joy.</p>
     <p>'Aye,' said Norman, looking up; 'they had something to say to him on his own score, which he
      has forgotten.'</p>
     <p>'I should think not,' said Harry. 'Why, what d'ye think they said? That I had gone on as
      well as all the Mays, and they trusted I should still, and be a credit to my profession.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Harry! why didn't you tell us?' Oh! that is grand!' and, as the two elder girls made
      this exclamation, Mary proceeded to a rapturous embrace. 'Get along, Mary, you are throttling
      one. Mr. Everard inquired for my father and Margaret, and said he'd call to-morrow, and Hoxton
      and Wilmot kept on wishing he was there.'</p>
     <p>'I wish he had been!' said Ethel; 'he would have taken such delight in it; but, even if he
      could have gone, he doubted whether it would not have made Norman get on worse from
      anxiety.'</p>
     <p>'Well, Cheviot wanted me to send up for him at dinner-time,' said Harry; 'for as soon as we
      sat down in the hall, June turned off giddy, and could not stay, and looked so horrid, we
      thought it was all over with him, and he would not be able to go up at all.'</p>
     <p>'And Cheviot thought you ought to send for papa!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I knew he would not be in, and so we left him lying down on the bench in the cloister
      till dinner was over.'</p>
     <p>'What a place for catching cold!' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'So Cheviot said, but I couldn't help it; and when we went to call him afterwards, he was
      all right. Wasn't it fun, when the names were called over, and May senior, at the head! I
      don't think it will be better when I am a post-captain myself! But Margaret has not heard half
      yet.'</p>
     <p>After telling it once in her room, once in the nursery, in whispers like gusts of wind, and
      once in the pantry, Harry employed himself
      <pb n="104"/> in writing—'Norman is Dux!' in immense letters, on pieces of paper, which he
      disposed all over the house, to meet the eyes of his father and Richard on their return.</p>
     <p>Ethel's joy was sadly damped by Norman's manner. He hardly spoke—only just came in to wish
      Margaret good-night, and shrank from her affectionate sayings, departing abruptly to his own
      room.</p>
     <p>'Poor fellow! he is sadly overdone,' said she, as he went.</p>
     <p>'Oh!' sighed Ethel, nearly ready to cry, 'tis not like what I used to fancy it would be when
      he came to the head of the school!'</p>
     <p>'It will be different to-morrow,' said Margaret, trying to console herself as well as Ethel.
      'Think how he has been on the strain this whole day, and long before, doing so much more than
      older boys. No wonder he is tired and worn out.'</p>
     <p>Ethel did not understand what mental fatigue was, for her active, vigorous spirit had never
      been tasked beyond its powers.</p>
     <p>'I hope he will be like himself to-morrow!' said she, disconsolately. 'I never saw him rough
      and hasty before. It was even with you, Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, Ethel, you arn't going to blame your own Norman for unkindness on this of all days
      in the year. You know how it was, you love him better; just as I do, for not being able to
      bear to stay in this room, where—'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, mournfully; 'it was a great shame of me! How could I? Dear Norman! how he
      does grieve—what love his must have been! But yet, Margaret,' she said, impatiently, and the
      hot tears breaking out, 'I cannot—cannot bear it! To have him not caring one but for all of
      us! I want him to triumph! I can't without him!'</p>
     <p>'What, Ethel, you, who said you didn't care for mere distinction and praise? Don't you think
      dear mamma would say it was safer for him not to be delighted and triumphant?'</p>
     <p>'It is very tiresome,' said Ethel, nearly convinced, but in a slightly petulant voice.</p>
     <p>'And does not one love those two dear boys to-night!' said Margaret. 'Norman, not able to
      rejoice in his victory without her, and Harry in such an ecstacy with Norman's honours. I
      don't think I ever was so fond of my two brothers.'</p>
     <p>Ethel smiled, and drew up her head, and said no boys were like them anywhere, and papa would
      be delighted, and so went to bed happier in her exultation, and in hoping that the holidays
      would make Norman himself again.</p>
     <p>Nothing could be better news for Dr. May, who had never lost a grain of the ancient
      school-party-loyalty that is part of the nature of the English gentleman. He was a thorough
      Stoneborough
      <pb n="105"/> boy, had followed the politics of the Whichcote foundation year by year all his
      life, and perhaps, in his heart, regarded no honour as more to be prized than that of Dux and
      Randall scholar. Harry was in his room the next morning as soon as ever he was stirring, a
      welcome guest—teased a little at first, by his pretending to take it all as a sailor's prank
      to hoax him and Richard, and then free to pour out to delighted ears the whole history of the
      examination, and of everyone's congratulations.</p>
     <p>Norman himself was asleep when Harry went to give this narration. He came down late, and his
      father rose to meet him as he entered. 'My boy,' he said, 'I had not expected this of you.
      Well done, Norman!' and the whole tone and gesture had a heartfelt approval and joy in them,
      that Ethel knew her brother was deeply thrilled by, for his colour deepened, and his lips
      quivered into something like a smile, though he did not lift his eyes.</p>
     <p>Then came Richard's warm greeting and congratulation, he, too, showing himself as delighted
      as if the honours were his own; and then Dr. May again, in lively tones, like old times,
      laughing at Norman for sleeping late, and still not looking well awake, asking him if he was
      quite sure it was not all a dream.</p>
     <p>'Well, said Norman, 'I should think it was, if it were not that you all believe it.'</p>
     <p>'Harry had better go to sleep next,' said Dr. May, 'and see what dreaming will make him. If
      it makes Dux of Norman, who knows but it may make Drakes of him? Ha! Ethel— 'O, give us for
      our Kings such Queens,    And for our Ducks such Drakes.' </p>
     <p>There had not been such a merry breakfast for months. There was the old confusion of voices;
      the boys, Richard, and the Doctor had much to talk over of the school doings of this week, and
      there was nearly as much laughing as in days past. Ethel wondered whether anyone but herself
      observed that the voice most seldom heard was Norman's.</p>
     <p>The promised call was made by Dr. Hoxton, and MR. Everard, an old friend, and after their
      departure Dr. May came to margaret's room with fresh accounts, corroborating what Harry had
      said of the clear knowledge and brilliant talent that Norman had displayed, to a degree that
      surprised his masters, almost as much as the examiners. The copy of verses Dr. May brought
      with him, and construed them to Margaret, commenting all the way on their ease, and the
      fulness of thought, certainly remarkable in a boy of sixteen.</p>
     <p>They were then resigned to Ethel's keeping, and she could not help imparting her admiration
      to their author, with some apology for vexing him again.</p>
     <pb n="106"/>
     <p>'I don't want to be cross,' said Norman, whom these words roused to a sense that he had been
      churlish last night; 'but I cannot help it. I wish people would not make such a fuss about
      it.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think you can be well, Norman.'</p>
     <p>'Nonsense. There's nothing the matter with me.'</p>
     <p>'But I don't understand your not caring at all, and not being the least pleased.'</p>
     <p>'It only makes it worse,' said Norman; 'I only feel as if I wanted to be out of the way. My
      only comfortable time yesterday was on that bench in the cool quiet cloister. I don't think I
      could have got through without that, when they left me in peace, till Cheviot and Harry came
      to rout me up, and I knew it was all coming.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! you have overworked yourself, but it was for something. You have given papa such
      pleasure and comfort, as you can't help being glad of. That is very different from us foolish
      young ones and our trumpeting.'</p>
     <p>'What comfort can it be? I've not been the smallest use all this time. When he was ill, I
      left him to Ernescliffe, and lay on the floor like an ass; and if he were to ask me to touch
      his arm, I should be as bad again. A fine thing for me to have talked all that arrogant stuff
      about Richard! I hate the thought of it; and, as if to make arrows and barbs of it, here's
      Richard making as much of this as if it was a double first class! He afraid to be compared
      with me, indeed!'</p>
     <p>'Norman, indeed, this is going too far. We can't be as useful as the elder ones; and when
      you know how papa was vexed about Richard, you must be glad to have pleased him.'</p>
     <p>'If I were he, it would only make me miss her more. I believe he only makes much of me that
      he may not disappoint me.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think so. He is really glad, and the more because she would have been so pleased.
      He said it would have been a happy day for her, and there was more of the glad look than the
      sorry one. It was the glistening look that comes when he is watching baby, or hearing Margaret
      say pretty things to her. You <hi>see</hi> it is the first bright morning we have had.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman; 'perhaps it was, but I don't know. I thought half of it was din.'</p>
     <p>'Oh Norman!'</p>
     <p>'And another thing, Ethel, I don't feel as if I had fairly earned it. Forder or Cheviot
      ought to have had it. They are both more really good scholars than I am, and have always been
      above me. There was nothing I really knew better, except those historical questions that no
      one reckoned on; and not living at home with their sisters and books, they had no such chance,
      and it is very hard on them, and I don't like it.'</p>
     <pb n="107"/>
     <p>'Well, but you really and truly beat them in everything.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, by chance. There were lots of places in construing, where I should have broken down if
      I had happened to be set on in them; it was only a wonder I did not in that chorus, for I had
      only looked at it twice; but Everard asked me nothing but what I knew; and now and then I get
      into a funny state, when nothing is too hard for me, and that was how it was yesterday
      evening. Generally, I feel as dull as a post,' said Norman, yawning and stretching; 'I could
      not make a nonsense hexameter this minute, if I was to die for it.'</p>
     <p>'A sort of Berserkar fury!' said Ethel, 'like that night you did the coral-worm verses. It's
      very odd. Are you sure you are well, dear Norman?'</p>
     <p>To which he answered, with displeasure, that he was as well as possible, ordered her not to
      go and make any more fuss, and left her hastily. She was unhappy, and far from satisfied; she
      had never known his temper so much affected, and was much puzzled; but she was too much afraid
      of vexing him, to impart her perplexity even to Margaret. However, the next day, Sunday, as
      she was reading to Margaret after Church, her father came in, and the first thing he said was,
      'I want to know what you think of Norman:'</p>
     <p>'How do you mean?' said Margaret; 'in health or spirits?'</p>
     <p>'Both,' said Dr. May. 'Poor boy! he has never held up his head since October, and, at his
      age, that is hardly natural. He goes moping about, has lost flesh and appetite, and looks
      altogether out of order, shooting up like a May-pole too.'</p>
     <p>'Mind and body,' said Margaret, while Ethel gazed intently at her father, wondering whether
      she ought to speak, for Margaret did not know half what she did; nothing about the bad nights,
      nor what he called the 'funny state.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, both. I fancied it was only his rapid growth, and the excitement of this examination,
      and that it would go off, but I think there's more amiss. He was lounging about doing nothing,
      when the girls were gone to school after dinner, and I asked him to walk down with me to the
      Almshouses. He did not seem very willing, but he went, and presently, as I had hold of his
      arm, I felt him shivering, and saw him turn as pale as a sheet. As soon as I noticed it, he
      flushed crimson, and would not hear of turning back, stoutly protesting he was quite well, but
      I saw his hand was quivering even when I got into Church. Why, Ethel, you have turned as red
      as he did.'</p>
     <p>'Then he has done it!' exclaimed Ethel, in a smothered voice.</p>
     <p>'What do you mean? Speak, Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'He has gone past it—the place,' whispered she.</p>
     <pb n="108"/>
     <p>The Doctor made a sound of sorrowful assent, as if much struck; then said, 'you don't mean
      he has never been there since?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, 'he has always gone round Randall's alley or the garden; he has said
      nothing, but has contrived to avoid it.</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Dr. May, after a pause, 'I hoped none of us knew the exact spot.'</p>
     <p>'We don't; he never told us, but he was there.'</p>
     <p>'Was he?' exclaimed her father; 'I had not notion of that. How came he there?'</p>
     <p>'He went on with Mr. Ernescliffe, and saw it all,' said Ethel, as her father drew out her
      words, apparently with his eye; 'and then came up to my room so faint that he was obliged to
      lie on the floor ever so long.'</p>
     <p>'Faint—how long did it last?' said her father, examining her without apparent emotion, as if
      it had been an indifferent patient.</p>
     <p>'I don't know, things seemed so long that evening. Till after dark at least, and it came on
      in the morning—no, the Monday. I believe it was your arm—for talking of going to see you
      always brought it on, till Mr. Ward gave him a dose of brandy-and-water, and that stopped
      it.'</p>
     <p>'I wish I had known this before. Derangement of the nervous system, no doubt—a susceptible
      boy like that—I wonder what sort of nights he has been having.'</p>
     <p>'Terrible ones,' said Ethel; 'I don't think he ever sleeps quietly till morning; he has
      dreams, and he groans and talks in his sleep: Harry can tell you all that.'</p>
     <p>'Bless me!' cried Dr. May, in some anger; 'what have you all been thinking about to keep
      this to yourselves all this time?'</p>
     <p>'He could not bear to have it mentioned,' said Ethel, timidly; 'and I didn't know that it
      signified so much; does it?'</p>
     <p>'It signifies so much, that I had rather have given a thousand pounds than have let him go
      on all this time, to be overworked at school, and wound up to that examination!'</p>
     <p>'Oh dear! I am sorry!' said Ethel, in great dismay. 'If you had but been at home when
      Cheviot wanted Harry to have sent for you—because he did not think him fit for it!' And Ethel
      was much relieved by pouring out all she knew, though her alarm was by no means lessened by
      the effect it produced on her father, especially when he heard of the "funny state."'</p>
     <p>'A fine state of things,' he said; 'I wonder it has not brought on a tremendous illness by
      this time. A boy of that sensitive temperament meeting with such a such a shock—never looked
      after—the quietest and most knocked down of all, and therefore the most neglected— his whole
      system disordered—and then driven to school to be
      <pb n="109"/> harassed and overworked; if we had wanted to occasion brain fever we could not
      have gone a better way to set about it.' I should not wonder if health and nerves were damaged
      for life!'</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa, papa!' cried Ethel, in extreme distress, 'what shall I do! I wish I had told you,
      but—'</p>
     <p>'I'm not blaming you, Ethel, you knew no better, but it has been grievous neglect. It is
      plain enough there is no one to see after you,' said the Doctor, with a low groan.</p>
     <p>'We may be taking it in time,' said Margaret's soft voice—'it is very well it has gone on no
      longer.'</p>
     <p>'Three months is long enough,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I suppose,' continued Margaret, 'it will be better not to let dear Norman know we are
      uneasy about him.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, certainly not. Don't say a word of this to him. I shall find Harry, and ask about
      these disturbed nights, and then watch him, trusting it may not have gone too far; but there
      must be dreadful excitability of brain!'</p>
     <p>He went away, leaving Margaret to comfort Ethel as well as she could, by showing her that he
      had not said the mischief was done, putting her in mind that he was wont to speak strongly;
      and trying to make her thankful that her brother would now have such care as might avert all
      evil results.</p>
     <p>'But, oh,' said Ethel, 'his success has been dearly purchased!'</p>

     <p>That night Norman started from, what was not so much sleep, as a trance of
      oppression and suffering, and beheld his father's face watching him attentively.</p>
     <p>'Papa! What's the matter?' said he, starting up. 'Is anyone ill?'</p>
     <p>'No; no one, lie down again,' said Dr. May, possessing himself of a hand, with a burning
      spot in the palm, and a throbbing pulse.</p>
     <p>'But what made you come here? Have I disturbed anyone? Have I been talking?'</p>
     <pb n="110"/>
     <p>'Only mumbling a little, but you looked very uncomfortable.'</p>
     <p>'But I'm not ill—what are you feeling my pulse for?' said Norman, uneasily.</p>
     <p>'To see whether that restless sleep has quickened it.'</p>
     <p>Norman scarcely let his father count for a moment, before he asked, 'What o'clock is
      it?'</p>
     <p>'A little after twelve.'</p>
     <p>'What does make you stay up so late, papa?'</p>
     <p>'I often do when my arm seems likely to keep me awake. Richard has done all I want.'</p>
     <p>'Pray don't stay here in the cold,' said Norman, with feverish impatience, as he turned
      upwards the cool side of his pillow. 'Good night!'</p>
     <p>'No hurry,' said his father, still watching him.</p>
     <p>'There's nothing the matter,' repeated the boy.</p>
     <p>'Do you often have such unquiet nights?'</p>
     <p>'Oh, it does not signify. Good night,' and he tried to look settled and comfortable.</p>
     <p>'Norman,' said his father, in a voice betraying much grief, 'it will not do to go on in this
      way. If your mother was here, you would not close yourself against her.'</p>
     <p>Norman interrupted him in a voice strangled with sobs: 'It is no good saying it—I thought it
      would only make it worse for you; but that's it. I cannot bear the being without her.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May was glad to see that a gush of tears followed this exclamation, as Norman hid his
      face under the coverings.</p>
     <p>'My poor boy,' said he, hardly able to speak, 'only One can comfort you truly; but you must
      not turn from me; you must let me do what I can for you, though it is not the same.'</p>
     <p>'I thought it would grieve you more,' said Norman, turning his face towards him again.</p>
     <p>'What, to find my children feeling with me, and knowing what they have lost? Surely not,
      Norman.'</p>
     <p>'And it is of no use,' added Norman, hiding his face again, 'no one can comfort—'</p>
     <p>'There you are wrong,' said Dr. May with deep feeling, 'there is much of comfort in
      everything, in everybody, in kindness, in all around, if one can only open one's mind to it.
      But I did not come to keep you awake with such talk; I saw you were not quite well, so I came
      up to see about you; and now, Norman, you will not refuse to own that something is the
      matter.'</p>
     <p>'I did not know it,' said Norman, 'I really believe I am well, if I could get rid of these
      horrible nights. I either lie awake, tumbling and tossing, or I get all sorts of unbearable
      dreams.'</p>
     <pb n="111"/>
     <p>'Aye, when I asked master Harry about you, all the answer I could get was, that he was quite
      used to it, and did not mind it at all. As if I asked for his sake! How fast that boy
      sleeps—he is fit for a midshipman's berth!'</p>
     <p>'But do you think there is anything amiss with me?'</p>
     <p>'I shall know more about that to-morrow morning. Come to my room as soon as you are up,
      unless I come to you. Now, I have something to read before I go to bed, and I may as well try
      if it will put you to sleep.'</p>
     <p>Norman's last sight that night was of the outline of his father's profile, and he was
      scarcely awake the next morning before Dr. May was there again.</p>
     <p>Unwilling as he had been to give way, it was a relief to relinquish the struggle to think
      himself well, and to venture to lounge and dawdle, rest his heavy head, and stretch his inert
      limbs without fear of remark. His father found him after breakfast lying on the sofa in the
      drawing-room with a Greek play by his side, telling Ethel what words to look out.</p>
     <p>'At it again!' exclaimed Dr. May. 'Carry it away, Ethel. I will have no Latin or Greek
      touched these holidays.'</p>
     <p>'You know,' said Norman, 'if I don't sap, I shall have no chance of keeping up.'</p>
     <p>'You'll keep no where, if you don't rest.'</p>
     <p>'It is only Euripides, and I can't do anything else,' said Norman, languidly.</p>
     <p>'Very likely, I don't care. You have to get well first of all, and the Greek will take care
      of itself. Go up to Margaret. I put you in her keeping, while I am gone to Whitford. After
      that, I dare say Richard will be very glad to have a holiday, and let you drive me to
      Abbotstoke.'</p>
     <p>Norman rose, and wearily walked up stairs, while his sister lingered to excuse herself.
      'Papa, I did not think Euripides would hurt him— he knows it all so well, and he said he could
      not read anything else.'</p>
     <p>'Just so, Ethel. Poor fellow, he has not spirits or energy for anything; his mind was forced
      into those classicalities when it wanted rest, and now it has not spring enough to turn back
      again.'</p>
     <p>'Do you think him so very ill?'</p>
     <p>'Not exactly, but there's low fever hanging about him, and we must look after him well, and
      I hope we may get him right. I have told Margaret about him; I can't stop any longer now.'</p>
     <p>Norman found the baby in his sister's room, and this was just what suited him. The Daisy
      showed a marked preference for her brothers; and to find her so merry and good with him,
      pleased and flattered him far more than his victory at school. He carried her
      <pb n="112"/> about, danced her, whistled to her, and made her admire her pretty blue eyes in
      the glass most successfully, till nurse carried her off. But perhaps he had been sent up
      rather too soon, for as he sat in the great chair by the fire, he was teased by the constant
      coming and going, all the petty cares of a large household transacted by Margaret —orders to
      butcher and cook—Harry racing in to ask to take Tom to the river—Tom, who was to go when his
      lesson was done, coming perpetually to try to repeat the same unhappy bit of <hi>As in
       Præsenti</hi> , each time in a worse whine.</p>
     <p>'How can you bear it, Margaret?' said Norman, as she finally dismissed Tom, and laid down
      her account-book, taking up some delicate fancy work. 'Mercy, here's another,' as enter a
      message about lamp oil, in the midst of which Mary burst in to beg Margaret to get Miss Winter
      to let her go to the river with Harry and Tom.</p>
     <p>'No, indeed, Mary, I could not think of such a thing. You had better go back to your
      lessons, and don't be silly,' as she looked much disposed to cry.</p>
     <p>'No one but a Tom-boy would dream of it,' added Norman; and Mary departed disconsolate,
      while Margaret gave a sigh of weariness, and said, as she returned to her work, 'There, I
      believe I have done. I hope I was not cross with poor Mary, but it was rather too much to
      ask.'</p>
     <p>'I can't think how you can help being cross to everyone,' said Norman, as he took away the
      books she had done with.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid I am,' said Margaret, sadly. 'It does get trying at times.'</p>
     <p>'I should think so! This eternal worrying must be more than anyone can bear, always lying
      there too.'</p>
     <p>'It is only now and then that it grows tiresome,' said Margaret. 'I am too happy to be of
      some use, and it is too bad to repine, but sometimes a feeling comes of its being always the
      same, as if a little change would be <hi>such</hi> a treat.'</p>
     <p>'Arn't you very tired of lying in bed?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, very sometimes. I fancy, but it is only fancy, that I could move better if I was up
      and dressed. It has seemed more so lately, since I have been stronger.'</p>
     <p>'When do you think they will let you get up?'</p>
     <p>'There's the question. I believe papa thinks I might be lifted to the sofa now—and oh! how I
      long for it—but then Mr. Ward does not approve of my sitting up, even as I am doing now, and
      wants to keep me flat. Papa thinks that of no use, and likely to hurt my general health, and I
      believe the end of it will be that he will ask Sir Matthew Fleet's opinion.'</p>
     <p>'Is that the man he calls Mat?'</p>
     <pb n="113"/>
     <p>'Yes, you know they went through the University together, and were at Edinburgh and Paris,
      but they have never met since he set up in London, and grew so famous. I believe it would be a
      great treat to papa to have him, and it would be a good thing for papa too; I don't think his
      arm is going on right—he does not trust to Mr. Ward's treatment, and I am sure some one else
      ought to see it.'</p>
     <p>'Did you know, Margaret, that he sits up quite late, because he cannot sleep for it?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I hear him moving about, but don't tell him so; I would not have him guess for the
      world, that it kept me awake.'</p>
     <p>'And does it?'</p>
     <p>'Why, if I think he is awake and in pain, I cannot settle myself to sleep, but that is no
      matter; having no exercise, of course I don't sleep so much. But I am very anxious about
      him—he looks so thin, and gets so fagged—and no wonder.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! Mr. Everard told me he was quite shocked to see him, and would hardly have known him,'
      and Norman groaned from the bottom of his heart.</p>
     <p>'Well, I shall hope much from Sir matthew's taking him in hand,' said Margaret, cheerfully;
      'he will mind him, though he will not Mr. Ward.'</p>
     <p>'I wish the holidays were over!' said Norman, with a yawn, as expressive as a sigh.</p>
     <p>'That's not civil, on the third day,' said Margaret, smiling, 'when I am so glad to have you
      to look after me, so as to set Flora at liberty.'</p>
     <p>'What, can I do you any good?' said Norman, with a shade of his former alacrity.</p>
     <p>'To be sure you can, a great deal. Better not come near me otherwise, for I make everyone
      into a slave. I want my morning reading now, that book on Advent, there.'</p>
     <p>'Shall I read it to you?'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, that's nice, and I shall get on with baby's frock.'</p>
     <p>Norman read, but, ere long, took to yawning; Margaret begged for the book, which he
      willingly resigned, saying, however, that he liked it, only he was stupid. She read on aloud,
      till she heard a succession of heavy breathings, and saw him fast asleep, and so he continued
      till waked by his father's coming home.</p>
     <p>Richard and Ethel were glad of a walk, for Margaret had found them a pleasant errand. Their
      Cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner between service and afternoon school, and
      Margaret had desired the cook to serve them up some broth in the back kitchen, to which the
      brother and sister were now to invite them.
      <pb n="114"/> Mary was allowed to take her boots to Rebekah Watts, since Margaret held that
      goodness had better be profitable, at least at the outset; and Harry and Tom joined the
      party.</p>
     <p>Norman, meantime, was driving his father—a holiday preferment highly valued in the days when
      Dr. May used only to assume the reins, when his spirited horses showed too much consciousness
      that they had a young hand over them, or when the old hack took a fit of laziness. Now, Norman
      needed Richard's assurance that the bay was steady, so far was he from being troubled with his
      ancient desire, that the steed would rear right up on his hind legs.</p>
     <p>He could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town, and found himself master
      of the animal, and even then the words were few, and chiefly spoken by Dr. May, until after
      going along about three miles of the turnpike road, he desired Norman to turn down a
      cross-country lane.</p>
     <p>'Where does this lead?'</p>
     <p>'It comes out at Abbotstoke, but I have to go to an outlying farm.'</p>
     <p>'Papa,' said Norman, after a few minutes, 'I wish you would let me do my Greek.'</p>
     <p>'Is that what you have been pondering all this time? What, may not the <hi>bonus
       Homerus</hi> slumber sometimes?'</p>
     <p>'It is not Homer, it is Euripides. I do assure you, papa, it is no trouble, and I get much
      worse without it.'</p>
     <p>'Well, stop here, the road grows so bad that we will walk, and let the boy lead the horse to
      meet us at Woodcote.'</p>
     <p>Norman followed his father down a steep narrow lane, little better than a stony
      water-course, and began to repeat, 'If you would but let me do my work! I've got nothing else
      to do, and now they have put me up, I should not like not to keep my place.'</p>
     <p>'Very likely, but—hollo—how swelled this is!' said Dr. May, as they came to the bottom of
      the valley, where a stream rushed along, coloured with a turbid creamy yellow, making little
      whirlpools where it crossed the road, and brawling loudly just above where it roared and
      foamed between two steep banks of rock, crossed by a foot-bridge of planks, guarded by a
      handrail of rough poles. The Doctor had traversed it, and gone a few paces beyond, when,
      looking back, he saw Norman very pale, with one foot on the plank, and one hand grasping the
      rail. He came back, and held out his hand, which Norman gladly caught at, but no sooner was
      the other side attained, than the boy, though he gasped with relief, exclaimed, 'This is too
      bad!' Wait one moment, please, and let me go back.'</p>
     <p>He tried, but the first touch of the shaking rail, and glance at
      <pb n="115"/> the chasm, disconcerted him, and his father, seeing his white cheeks and rigid
      lips, said, 'Stop, Norman, don't try it. You are not fit,' he added, as the boy came to him
      reluctantly.</p>
     <p>I can't bear to be such a wretch!' said he. 'I never used to be. I will not—let me conquer
      it;' and he was turning back, but the Doctor took his arm, saying decidedly, 'No, I won't have
      it done. You are only making it worse, by putting a force on yourself.'</p>
     <p>But the further Norman was from the bridge, the more displeased he was with himself, and
      more anxious to dare it again. 'There's no bearing it,' he muttered; 'let me only run back.
      I'll overtake you. I must do it if no one looks on.'</p>
     <p>'No such thing,' said the Doctor, holding him fast. 'If you do, you'll have it all over
      again at night.'</p>
     <p>'That's better than to know I am worse than Tom.'</p>
     <p>'I tell you, Norman it is no such thing. You will recover your tone if you will only do as
      you are told, but your nerves have had a severe shock, and when you force yourself in this
      way, you only increase the mischief.'</p>
     <p>'Nerves,' muttered Norman, disdainfully, 'I thought they were only fit for fine ladies.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May smiled. 'Well, will it content you if I promise that as soon as I see fit, I'll
      bring you here, and let you march over that bridge as often as you like?'</p>
     <p>'I suppose I must be contented, but I don't like to feel like a fool.'</p>
     <p>'You need not, while the moral determination is sound.'</p>
     <p>'But my Greek, papa.'</p>
     <p>'At it again—I declare, Norman, you are the worst patient I ever had!'</p>
     <p>Norman made no answer, and Dr. May presently said, 'Well, let me hear what you have to say
      about it. I assure you it is not that I don't want you to get on, but that I see you are in
      great need of rest.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, papa. I know you mean it for my good, but I don't think you do know how horrid
      it is. I have got nothing on earth to do or care for—the school work comes quite easy to me,
      and I'm sure thinking is worse; and then,' Norman spoke vehemently, 'now they have put me up,
      it will never do to be beaten, and all the four others ought to be able to do it. I did not
      want or expect to be Dux, but now I am, you could not bear me not to keep my place, and to
      miss the Randall scholarship, as I certainly shall, if I do not work these whole
      holidays.'</p>
     <p>'Norman, I know it,' said his father, kindly. 'I am very sorry for you, and I know I am
      asking of you what I could not have done at your age—indeed, I dont believe I could have done
      it for you a
      <pb n="116"/> few months ago. It is my fault that you have been let alone, to have an
      overstrain and pressure on your mind, when you were not fit for it, and I cannot see any
      remedy but complete freedom from work. At the same time, if you fret and harass yourself about
      being surpassed, that is, as you say, much worse for you than Latin and Greek. Perhaps I may
      be wrong, and study might not do you the harm I think it would; at any rate, it is better than
      tormenting yourself about next half year, so I will not positively forbid it, but I think you
      had much better let it alone. I don't want to make it a matter of duty. I only tell you this,
      that you may set your mind at rest as far as I am concerned. If you do lose your place, I will
      consider it as my own doing, and not be disappointed. I had rather see you a healthy,
      vigorous, useful man, than a poor puling nervous wretch of a scholar, if you were to get all
      the prizes in the University.'</p>
     <p>Norman made a little murmuring sound of assent, and both were silent for some moments, then
      he said; 'Then you will not be displeased, papa, if I do read, as long as I feel it does me no
      harm.'</p>
     <p>'I told you I don't mean to make it a matter of obedience. Do as you please—I had rather you
      read than vexed yourself.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad of it. Thank you, papa,' said Norman, in a much cheered voice.</p>
     <p>They had, in the meantime, been mounting a rising ground, clothed with stunted wood, and
      came out on a wide heath, brown with dead bracken; a hollow, traced by the tops of leafless
      trees, marked the course of the stream that traversed it, and the inequalities of ground
      becoming more rugged in outlines and greyer in colouring as they receded, till they were
      closed by a dark fir wood, beyond which rose in extreme distance, the grand mass of Welsh
      mountain heads, purpled against the evening sky, except where the crowning peaks bore a veil
      of snow. Behind, the sky was pure gold, gradually shading into pale green, and then into clear
      light wintry blue, while the sun setting behind two of the loftiest, seemed to confound their
      outlines, and blend them in one flood of soft hazy brightness. Dr. May looked at his son, and
      saw his face clear up, his brow expand, and his lips unclose with admiration.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said the Doctor, 'it is very fine, is it not? I used to bring mamma here now and then
      for a treat, because it put her in mind of her Scottish hills. Well, your's are the golden
      hills of heaven, now, my Maggie!' he added, hardly knowing that he spoke aloud. Norman's
      throat swelled, as he looked up in his face, then cast down his eyes hastily to hide the tears
      that had gathered on his eyelashes.</p>
     <p>'I'll leave you here,' said Dr. May, 'I have to go to a farmhouse
      <pb n="117"/> close by, in the hollow behind us, there's a girl recovering from a fever. I'll
      not be ten minutes, so wait here.'</p>
     <p>When he came back, Norman was still where he had left him, gazing earnestly, and the tears
      standing on his cheeks. He did not move till his father laid his hand on his shoulder—they
      walked away together without a word, and scarcely spoke all the way home.</p>
     <p>Dr. May went to Margaret and talked to her of Norman's fine character, and intense affection
      for his mother, the determined temper, and quietly borne grief, for which the Doctor seemed to
      have worked himself into a perfect enthusiasm of admiration; but lamenting that he could not
      tell what to do with him—study or no study hurt him alike—and he dreaded to see health and
      spirits shattered for ever. They tried to devise change of scene, but it did not seem possible
      just at present; and Margaret, besides her fears for Norman, was much grieved to see this
      added to her father's troubles.</p>
     <p>At night Dr. May again went up to see whether Norman, whom he had moved into Margaret's
      former room, were again suffering from fever. He found him asleep in a restless attitude, as
      if he had just dropped off, and waking almost at the instant of his entrance, he exclaimed,
      'Is it you? I thought it was mamma. She said it was all ambition.'</p>
     <p>Then starting, and looking round the room, and at his father, he collected himself, and
      said, with a slight smile, 'I didn't know I had been asleep. I was awake just now, thinking
      about it. Papa, I'll give it up. I'll try to put next half out of my head, and not mind if
      they do pass me.'</p>
     <p>'That's right, my boy,' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'At least if Cheviot and Forder do, for they ought. I only hope Anderson won't. I can stand
      anything but that. But that is nonsense too.'</p>
     <p>'You are quite right, Norman,' said the Doctor, 'and it is a great relief to me that you see
      the thing so sensibly.'</p>
     <p>'No, I don't see it sensibly at all, papa. I hate it all the time, and I don't know whether
      I can keep from thinking of it, when I have nothing to do; but I see it is wrong; I thought
      all ambition and nonsense was gone out of me, when I cared so little for the examination; but
      now I see, though I did not want to be made first, I can't bear not to be first; and that's
      the old story, just as <hi>she</hi> used to tell me to guard against ambition. So I'll take my
      chance, and if I should get put down, why 'twas not fair that I should be put up, and it is
      what I ought to be, and serves me right into the bargain—'</p>
     <pb n="118"/>
     <p>'Well, that's the best sort of sense, your mother's sense,' said the Doctor, more affected
      than he liked to show. 'No wonder she came to you in your dream, Norman, my boy, if you had
      come to such a resolution. I was half in hopes you had some such notion when I came upon you,
      on Far-view down.'</p>
     <p>'I think that sky did it,' said Norman, in a low voice; 'it made me think of her in a
      different way—and what you said too.'</p>
     <p>'What did I say? I dont remember.'</p>
     <p>But Norman could not repeat the words, and only murmured 'golden hills'—It was enough.</p>
     <p>'I see,' said the Doctor, 'you had dwelt on the blank here, not taken home what it is to
      her.'</p>
     <p>'Aye'—almost sobbed Norman, 'I never could before—that made me,' after a long silence, 'and
      then I know how foolish I was, and how she would say it was wrong to make this fuss, when you
      did not like it, about my place, and that it was not for the sake of my duty, but of ambition;
      I knew that, but till I went to bed to-night, I could not tell whether I could make up my
      mind, so I would say nothing.</p>

      <l>'The days are sad, it is the Holy tide,</l>
      <l>   When flowers have ceased to blow and birds to sing.'</l><p><hi>F. Tennyson.</hi></p></quote>
     <p>It had been a hard struggle to give up all thoughts of study, and Norman was not at
      first rewarded for it, but rather exemplified the truth of his own assertion, that he was
      worse without it; for when this sole occupation for his mind was taken away, he drooped still
      more. He would willingly have shown his father that he was not discontented, but he was too
      entirely unnerved to be either cheerful or capable of entering with interest into any
      occupation. If he had been positively ill, the task would have been easier, but the low
      intermittent fever that hung about him, did not confine him to bed, only kept him lounging,
      listless and forlorn, through the weary day, not always able to go out with his father, and on
      Christmas-Day unfit even for Church.</p>
     <p>All this made the want of his mother, and the vacancy in his home, still more evident, and
      nothing was capable of relieving his sadness but his father's kindness, which was a continual
      <pb n="119"/> surprise to him. Dr. May was a parent who could not fail to be loved and
      honoured; but, as a busy man, trusting all at home to his wife, he had only appeared to his
      children either as a merry playfellow, or as a stern paternal authority, not often in the
      intermediate light of guiding friend, or gentle guardian; and it affected Norman exceedingly
      to find himself, a tall school-boy, watched and soothed with motherly tenderness and
      affection; with complete comprehension of his feelings, and delicate care of them. His
      father's solicitude and sympathy were round him day and night, and this, in the midst of so
      much toil, pain, grief, and anxiety of his own, that Norman might well feel overwhelmed with
      the swelling, inexpressible feelings of grateful affection.</p>
     <p>How could his father know exactly what he would like—say the very things he was thinking—see
      that his depression was not wilful repining—find exactly what best soothed him! He wondered,
      but he could not have said so to anyone, only his eye brightened, and, as his sisters
      remarked, he never seemed half so uncomfortable when papa was in the room. Indeed, the
      certainty that his father felt the sorrow as acutely as himself, was one reason of his opening
      to him. He could not feel that his brothers and sisters did so, for, outwardly, their habits
      were unaltered, their spirits not lowered, their relish for things around much the same as
      before, and this had given Norman a sense of isolation. With his father it was different.
      Norman knew he could never appreciate what the bereavement was to him—he saw its traces in
      almost every word and look, and yet perceived that something sustained and consoled him,
      though not in the way of forgetfulness. Now and then Norman caught at what gave this comfort,
      and it might be hoped he would do so increasingly; though, on this Christmas-Day, Margaret
      felt very sad about him, as she watched him sitting over the fire, cowering with chilliness
      and headache, while everyone was gone to Church, and saw that the reading of the service with
      her had been more of a trouble than a solace.</p>
     <p>She tried to think it bodily ailment, and strove hard not to pine for her mother, to comfort
      them both, and say the fond words of refreshing cheering pity that would have made all light
      to bear. Margaret's home Christmas was so spent in caring for brother, father, and children,
      that she had hardly time to dwell on the sad change that had befallen herself.</p>
     <p>Christmas was a season that none of them knew well how to meet: Blanche was overheard saying
      to Mary, that she wished it would not come, and Mary, shaking her head, and answering that she
      was afraid that was naughty, but it was very tiresome to have no fun. Margaret did her best
      up-stairs, and Richard down-stairs,
      <pb n="120"/> by the help of prints and hymns, to make the children think of the true joy of
      Christmas, and in the evening their father gathered them round, and told them the stories of
      the Shepherds and of the Wise Men, till Mary and Blanche agreed, as they went up to bed, that
      it had been a very happy evening.</p>
     <p>The next day Harry discomfited the school-room by bursting in with the news, that 'Louisa
      and Fanny Anderson were bearing down on the front door.' Ethel and Flora were obliged to
      appear in the drawing-room, where they were greeted by two girls, rather older than
      themselves. A whole shower of inquiries for Dr. May, for Margaret, and for the dear little
      baby, were first poured out; then came hopes that Norman was well, as they had not seen him at
      Church yesterday.</p>
     <p>'Thank you, he was kept at home by a bad headache, but it is better to-day.'</p>
     <p>'We came to congratulate you on his success—we could not help it—it must have been such a
      pleasure to you.'</p>
     <p>'That it was!' exclaimed Ethel, pleased at participation in her rejoicing. 'We were so
      surprised.'</p>
     <p>Flora gave a glance of warning, but Ethel's short-sighted eyes were beyond the range of
      correspondence, and Miss Anderson continued. 'It must have been a delightful surprise. We
      could hardly believe it when Harvey came in and told us. Everyone thought Forder was sure, but
      they all were put out by the questions of general information—those were all Mr. Everard's
      doing.'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Everard was very much struck with Norman's knowledge and scholarship too,' said
      Flora.</p>
     <p>'So everyone says. It was all Mr. Everard's doing, Miss Harrison told mamma, but, for my
      part, I am very glad for the sake of Stoneborough; I like a town boy to be at the head.'</p>
     <p>'Norman was sorry for Forder and Cheviot—' began Ethel. Flora tried to stop her, but Louisa
      Anderson caught at what she said, and looked eagerly for more. 'He felt,' said she, only
      thinking of exalting her generous brother, 'as if it was hardly right, when they are so much
      his seniors, and he could scarcely enjoy it.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! that is just what people say,' replied Louisa. 'But it must be very gratifying to you,
      and it makes him certain of the Randall scholarship too, I suppose. It is a great thing for
      him! He must have worked very hard.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, that he has,' said Flora; 'he is so fond of study, and that goes half way.'</p>
     <p>'So is dear Harvey. How earnest he is over his books! Mamma sometimes says, "Now Harvey,
      dear, you'll be quite stupified, you'll be ill; I really shall get Dr. May to forbid you." I
      suppose
      <pb n="121"/> Norman is very busy too; it is quite the fashion for boys not to be idle
      now.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Norman can't help it,' said Ethel, piteously. 'Papa will not hear of his doing any
      Latin or Greek these whole holidays.'</p>
     <p>'He thinks he will come to it better again for entire rest,' said Flora, launching another
      look at her sister, which again fell short.</p>
     <p>A great deal of polite inquiry whether they were uneasy about him followed, mixed with a
      little boasting of dear Harvey's diligence.</p>
     <p>'By-the-bye, Ethel, it is you that are the great patroness of the wild Cocksmoor
      children—are not you?'</p>
     <p>Ethel coloured, and mumbled, and Flora answered for her, 'Richard and Ethel have been there
      once or twice. You know our under nursery-maid is a Cocksmoor girl.'</p>
     <p>'Well, mamma said she could not think how Miss May could take one from thence. The whole
      place is full of thieves, and do you know, Bessie Boulder has lost her gold pencil-case.'</p>
     <p>'Has she?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'And she had it on Sunday when she was teaching her class.'</p>
     <p>'Oh!' cried Ethel, vehemently; 'surely she does not suspect any of those poor children!'</p>
     <p>'I only know such a thing never happened at school before,' said Fanny, 'and I shall never
      take anything valuable there again.'</p>
     <p>'But is she sure she lost it at school?'</p>
     <p>'O yes, quite certain. She will not accuse anyone, but it is not comfortable. And how those
      children do behave at Church!'</p>
     <p>'Poor things! they have been sadly neglected,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'They are quite spoiling the rest, and they are such figures! Why don't you, at least, make
      them cut their hair? You know it is the rule of the school.'</p>
     <p>'I know, but half the girls in the first class wear it long.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, yes, but those are the superior people, that one would not be strict with, and they
      dress it so nicely too. Now these are like little savages.'</p>
     <p>'Richard thinks it might drive them away to insist at first,' said Ethel; 'we will try to
      bring it about in time.'</p>
     <p>'Well, Mrs. Ledwich is nearly resolved to insist, so you had better be warned, Ethel. She
      cannot suffer such untidiness and rags to spoil the appearance of the school, and, I assure
      you, it is quite unpleasant to the teachers.'</p>
     <p>'I wish they would give them all to me!' said Ethel. 'But I do hope Mrs. Ledwich will have
      patience with them, for they are only to be gained gently.'</p>
     <p>The visitors took their leave, and the two sisters began exclaiming —Ethel at their dislike
      of her <hi>protégés</hi> , and Flora at what they
      <pb n="122"/> had said of Norman. 'And you, Ethel, how could you go and tell them we were
      surprised, and Norman thought it was hard on the other boys? They'll have it all over the town
      that he got it unjustly, and knows it, as they say already it was partiality of Mr.
      Everard's.</p>
     <p>'O no, no, they never can be so bad!' cried Ethel; 'they must have understood better that it
      was his noble humility and generosity.'</p>
     <p>'They understand anything noble! No indeed! They think everyone like their own beautiful
      brother! I knew what they came for all the time; they wanted to know whether Norman was able
      to work these holidays, and you told them the very thing they wanted to hear. How they will
      rejoice with that Harvey, and make sure of the Randall!'</p>
     <p>'O no, no!' cried Ethel; 'Norman must get that!'</p>
     <p>'I don't think he will,' said Flora, 'losing all this time, while they are working. It
      cannot be helped, of course, but it is a great pity.'</p>
     <p>'I almost wish he had not been put up at all, if it is to end in this way,' said Ethel. 'It
      is very provoking, and to have them triumphing as they will! There's no bearing it!'</p>
     <p>'Norman, certainly, is not at all well, poor fellow,' said Flora, 'and I suppose he wants
      rest, but I wish papa would let him do what he can. It would be much better for him than
      moping about as he is always doing now; and the disappointment of losing his place will be
      grievous, though now he fancies he does not care for it.'</p>
     <p>'I wonder when he will ever care for anything again. All I read and tell him only seems to
      teaze him, though he tries to thank me.'</p>
     <p>'There is a strange apathy about him,' said Flora, 'but I believe it is chiefly for want of
      exertion. I should like to rouse him if papa would let me; I know I could, by telling him how
      these Andersons are reckoning on his getting down. If he does, I shall be ready to run away,
      that I may never meet anyone here again.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was very unhappy till she was able to pour all this trouble out to Margaret, and
      worked herself almost into crying about Norman's being passed by 'that Harvey,' and his
      sisters exulting, and papa being vexed, and Norman losing time and not caring.</p>
     <p>'There you are wrong,' said Margaret, 'Norman did care very much, and it was not till he had
      seen clearly that it was a matter of duty to do as papa thought right, and not agitate his
      mind about his chances of keeping up, that he could bear to give up his work; and she told
      Ethel a little of what had passed.</p>
     <p>Ethel was much struck. 'But oh! Margaret, it is very hard,
      <pb n="123"/> just to have him put up for the sake of being put down, and pleasing the
      Andersons!'</p>
     <p>'Dear Ethel, why should you mind so much about the Andersons? May they not care about their
      brother as we do for ours?'</p>
     <p>'Such a brother to care about!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'But I suppose they may like him the best,' said Margaret, smiling.</p>
     <p>'I suppose they do, said Ethel, grudgingly; 'but still I cannot bear to see Norman doing
      nothing, and know Harvey Anderson will beat him.'</p>
     <p>'Surely you had rather he did nothing than made himself ill.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure, but I wish it wasn't so.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; but, Ethel, whose doing is his getting into this state?'</p>
     <p>Ethel looked grave. 'It was wrong of me,' said she, 'but then papa is not sure that Greek
      would hurt him.'</p>
     <p>'Not sure, but he thinks it not wise to run the risk. But, Ethel, dear, why are you so bent
      on his being Dux at all costs?'</p>
     <p>'It would be horrid if he was not.'</p>
     <p>'Don't you remember you used to say that outward praise or honour was not to be cared for as
      long as one did one's duty, and that it might be a temptation?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I know I did,' said Ethel, faltering, 'but that was for one's self.'</p>
     <p>'It is harder, I think, to feel so about those we care for,' said Margaret; 'but after all,
      this is just what will show whether our pride in Norman is the right true loving pride, or
      whether it is only the family vanity of triumphing over the Andersons.'</p>
     <p>Ethel hung her head. 'There's some of that,' she said, 'but it is not all. No—I don't want
      to triumph over them, nobody would do that.'</p>
     <p>'Not outwardly perhaps, but in their hearts.'</p>
     <p>'I can't tell,' said Ethel, 'but it is the being triumphed over that I cannot bear.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps this is all a lesson in humility for us,' said Margaret, 'It is teaching us,
      "Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be
      exalted."'</p>
     <p>Ethel was silent for some little space, then suddenly exclaimed, 'And you think he will
      really be put down?'</p>
     <p>Margaret seemed to have been talking with little effect, but she kept her patience, and
      answered, 'I cannot guess, Ethel, but I'll tell you one thing—I think there's much more chance
      if he comes to his work fresh and vigorous after a rest, than if he went on dulling himself
      with it all this time.'</p>
     <p>With which Ethel was so far appeased that she promised to think as little as she could of
      the Andersons, and a walk with Richard to Cocksmoor turned the current of her thoughts. They
      had caught some more Sunday-school children by the help of Margaret's broth,
      <pb n="124"/> but it was up-hill work; the servants did not like such guests in the kitchen,
      and they were still less welcome at school.</p>
     <p>'What do you think I heard, Ethel?' said Flora, the next Sunday, as they joined each other
      in the walk from School to Church; 'I heard Miss Graves say to Miss Boulder, "I declare I must
      remonstrate. I undertook to instruct a national, not a ragged school;" and then Miss Boulder
      shook out her fine watered silk and said, "It positively is improper to place ladies in
      contact with such squalid objects."'</p>
     <p>'Ladies!' cried Ethel. 'A stationer's daughter and a banker's clerk's! Why do they come to
      teach at school at all?'</p>
     <p>'Because our example makes it genteel,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I hope you did something more in hopes of making it genteel.'</p>
     <p>'I caught one of your ragged regiment with her frock gaping behind, and pinned it up. Such
      rags as there were under it! O Ethel!'</p>
     <p>'Which was it?'</p>
     <p>'That merry Irish-looking child. I don't know her name.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! it is a real charming Irish name, Una M'Carthy. I am so glad you did it, Flora. I hope
      they were ashamed.'</p>
     <p>'I doubt whether it will do good. We are sure of our station and can do anything—they are
      struggling to be ladies.'</p>
     <p>'But we ought not to talk of them any more, Flora; here we are almost at the
      Churchyard.'</p>
     <p>The Tuesday of this week was appointed for the visit of the London surgeon, Sir Matthew
      Fleet, and the expectation caused Dr. May to talk much to Margaret of old times, and the days
      of his courtship, when it had been his favorite project that his friend and fellow-student
      should marry Flora Mackenzie, and there had been a promising degree of liking, but 'Mat' had
      been obliged to be prudent, and had ended by never marrying at all. This the Doctor, as well
      as his daughters, believed was for the sake of Aunt Flora, and thus the girls were a good deal
      excited about his coming, almost as much on his own account, as because they considered him as
      the arbitrer of Margaret's fate. He only came in time for a seven o'clock dinner, and Margaret
      did not see him that night, but heard enough from her sisters, when they came up to tell the
      history of their guest, and of the first set dinner when Flora had acted as lady of the,
      house. The dinner it appeared had gone off very well. Flora had managed admirably, and the
      only mishap was some awkward carving of Ethel's which had caused the dish to be changed with
      Norman. As to the guest, Flora said he was very good-looking and agreeable. Ethel abruptly
      pronounced, 'I am very glad Aunt Flora married Uncle Arnott instead.'</p>
     <pb n="125"/>
     <p>'I can't think why,' said Flora. 'I never saw a person of pleasanter manners.'</p>
     <p>'Did they talk of old times?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'No,' said Ethel; 'that was the thing.'</p>
     <p>'You would not have them talk of those matters in the middle of dinner,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'No,' again said Ethel; 'but papa has a way—don't you know, Margaret, how one can tell in a
      moment if it is company talk.'</p>
     <p>'What was the conversation about?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'They talked over some of their old fellow-students,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel; 'and then when papa told him that beautiful history of Dr. Spencer going
      to take care of those poor emigrants in the fever, what do you think he said? "Yes, Spencer
      was always doing extravagant things." Fancy that to papa, who can hardly speak of it without
      having to wipe his spectacles, and who so longs to hear of Dr. Spencer.'</p>
     <p>'And what did he say?'</p>
     <p>'Nothing; so Flora and Sir Matthew got to pictures and all that sort of thing, and it was
      all company talk after that.'</p>
     <p>'Most entertaining in its kind,' said Flora: 'but—oh, Norman!' as he entered—'why they are
      not out of the dining-room yet!'</p>
     <p>'No; they are talking of some new invention, and most likely will not come for an hour.'</p>
     <p>'Are you going to bed?'</p>
     <p>'Papa followed me out of the dining-room to tell me to do so after tea.'</p>
     <p>'Then sit down there, and I'll go and make some, and let it come up with Margaret's. Come,
      Ethel. Good night, Norman. Is your head aching to-night?'</p>
     <p>'Not much, now I have got out of the dining-room.'</p>
     <p>'It would have been wiser not to have gone in,' said Flora, leaving the room.</p>
     <p>'It was not the dinner, but the man,' said Norman. 'It is incomprehensible to me how my
      father could take to him. I'd as soon have Harvey Anderson for a friend!'</p>
     <p>'You are like me,' said Ethel, 'in being glad he is not our uncle.'</p>
     <p>'He presume to think of falling in love with Aunt Flora!' cried Norman, indignantly.</p>
     <p>'Why, what is the matter with him?' asked Margaret. 'I can't find much ground for Ethel's
      dislike, and Flora is pleased.'</p>
     <p>'She did not hear the worst, nor you either, Ethel,' said Norman. 'I could not stand the
      cold hard way he spoke of hospital patients. 'I am sure he thinks poor people nothing but a
      study, and rich ones nothing but a profit. And his half sneers! But what I hated most was his
      way of avoiding discussions. When he saw he had said
      <pb n="126"/> what would not go down with papa, he did not honestly stand up to the point, and
      argue it out, but seemed to have no mind of his own, and to be only talking to please papa—but
      not knowing how to do it. He understand my father indeed!'</p>
     <p>Norman's indignation had quite revived him, and Margaret was much entertained with the
      conflicting opinions. The next was Richard's, when he came in late to wish her good night,
      after he had been attending on Sir Matthew's examination of his father's arm. He did nothing
      but admire the surgeon's delicacy of touch and understanding of the case, his view agreeing
      much better with Dr. May's own than with Mr. Ward's. Dr. May had never been entirely satisfied
      with the present mode of treatment, and Richard was much struck by hearing him say, in answer
      to Sir Matthew, that he knew his recovery might have been more speedy and less painful if he
      had been able to attend to it at first, or to afford time for being longer laid up. A change
      of treatment was now to be made, likely soon to relieve the pain, to be less tedious and
      trouble-some, and to bring about a complete cure in three or four months at latest. In hearing
      such tidings, there could be little thought of the person who brought them, and Margaret did
      not, till the last moment, learn that Richard thought Sir Matthew very clever and sensible,
      and certain to understand her case. Her last visitor was her father: 'Asleep, Margaret? I
      thought I had better go to Norman first in case he should be awake.'</p>
     <p>'Was he?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, but his pulse is better to-night. He was lying awake to hear what Fleet thought of me.
      I suppose Richard told you.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, dear papa, what a comfort it is!'</p>
     <p>'Those fellows in London do keep up to the mark! But I would not be there for something. I
      never saw a man so altered. However, if he can only do for you as well—but it is of no use
      talking about it. I may trust you to keep yourself calm, my dear?'</p>
     <p>'I am trying—indeed I am, dear papa. If you could help being anxious for me—though I know it
      is worse for you, for I only have to lie still, and you have to settle for me. But I have been
      thinking how well off I am, able to enjoy so much, and be employed all day long. It is nothing
      to compare with that poor girl you told me of, and you need not be unhappy for me. I have some
      verses to say over to myself to-night: "O Lord my God, do Thou Thy holy will,    I will lie
      still, I will not stir, lest I forsake. Thine arm    And break the charm That lulls me,
      clinging to my Father's breast    In perfect rest." Is not that comfortable?'</p>
     <pb n="127"/>
     <p>'My child—my dear child—I will say no more, lest I should break your sweet peace with my
      impatience. I will strive for the same temper, my Margaret. Bless you, dearest,
      good-night.'</p>
     <p>After a night spent in waking intervals of such thoughts, Margaret found the ordinary
      morning, and the talk she could not escape, somewhat oppressive. Her brothers and sisters
      disturbed her by their open expressions of hope and anxiety; she dreaded to have the balance
      of tranquillity overset; and then blamed herself for selfishness in not being as ready to
      attend to them as usual. Ethel and Norman came up after breakfast, their aversion by no means
      decreased by further acquaintance. Ethel was highly indignant at the tone in which he had
      exclaimed, 'What, May, have you one as young as this?' on discovering the existence of the
      baby; and when Norman observed that was not so atrocious either, she proceeded, 'You did not
      hear the contemptuous compassionate tone when he asked papa what he meant to do with all these
      boys.'</p>
     <p>'I'm glad he has not to settle,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Papa said Harry was to be a sailor, and he said it was a good way to save expenses of
      education—a good thing.'</p>
     <p>'No doubt,' said Norman, 'he thinks papa only wants to get rid of us, or if not, that it is
      an amiable weakness.'</p>
     <p>'But I can't see anything so shocking in this,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'It is not the words,' said Norman, 'the look and tone convey it; but there are different
      opinions. Flora is quite smitten with him, he talks so politely to her.'</p>
     <p>'And Blanche!' said Ethel. 'The little affected pussy-cat made a set at him, bridled and
      talked in her mincing voice, with all her airs, and made him take a great deal of notice of
      her.'</p>
     <p>Nurse here came to prepare for the surgeon's visit.</p>
     <p>It was over, and Margaret awaited the judgment. Sir Matthew had spoken hopefully to her, but
      she feared to fasten hopes on what might have no meaning, and could rely on nothing, till she
      had seen her father, who never kept back his genuine opinion, and would least of all from her.
      She found her spirits too much agitated to talk to her sisters, and quietly begged them to let
      her be quite alone till the consultation was over, and she lay trying to prepare herself to
      submit thankfully, whether she might be bidden to resign herself to helplessness, or to let
      her mind open once more to visions of joyous usefulness. Every step she hoped would prove to
      be her father's approach, and the longest hour of her life was that before he entered her
      room. His face said that the tidings were good, and yet she could not ask.</p>
     <p>'Well, Margaret, I am glad we had him down. He thinks you may get about again, though it may
      be a long time first.'</p>
     <pb n="128"/>
     <p>'Does he—oh papa!' and the colour spread over her face, as she squeezed his hand very
      fast.</p>
     <p>'He has known the use of the limbs return almost suddenly after even a year or two,' and Dr.
      May gave her the grounds of the opinion, and an account of other like cases, which he said had
      convinced him, 'though, my poor child,' he said, 'I feared the harm I had done you was
      irremediable, but thanks—' He turned away his face, and the clasp of their hands spoke the
      rest.</p>
     <p>Presently he told Margaret that she was no longer to be kept prostrate, but she was to do
      exactly as was most comfortable to her, avoiding nothing but fatigue. She might be lifted to
      the sofa the next day, and if that agreed with her, she might be carried down-stairs.</p>
     <p>This, in itself, after she had been confined to her bed for three months, was a release from
      captivity, and all the brothers and sisters rejoiced as if she was actually on her feet again.
      Richard betook himself to constructing a reading frame for the sofa; Harry tormented Miss
      Winter by insisting on a holiday for the others, aud gained the day by an appeal to his
      father; then declared he should go and tell Mr. Wilmot the good news; and Norman, quite
      enlivened, took up his hat, and said he would come too.</p>
     <p>In all his joy, however, Dr. May could not cease bewailing the alteration in his old friend,
      and spent half the evening in telling Margaret how different he had once been, in terms little
      less measured than Ethel's: 'I never saw such a change. Mat Fleet was one of the most warm,
      open-hearted fellows in the world, up to anything. I can hardly believe he is the same—turned
      into a mere machine, with a moving spring of self-interest! I don't believe he cares a rush
      for any living thing! Except for your sake, Margaret, I wish I had never seen him again, and
      only remembered him as he was at Edinburgh, as I remember dear old Spencer. It is a grievous
      thing! Ruined entirely! No doubt that London life must be trying— the constant change and
      bewilderment of patients preventing much individual care and interest. It must be very
      hardening. No family ties either, nothing to look to but pushing his way. Yes! there's great
      excuse for poor Mat. I never knew fully till now the blessing it was that your dear mother was
      willing to take me so early, and that this place was open to me with all its home connexions
      and interests. I am glad I never had anything to do with London!'</p>
     <p>And when he was alone with Norman, he could not help saying, 'Norman, my boy, I'm more glad
      than ever you yielded to me about your Greek these holidays, and for the reason you did. Take
      care the love of rising and pushing never gets hold of you; there's nothing that faster
      changes a man from his better self.'</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, Sir Matthew Fleet had met another old college friend
      <pb n="129"/> in London, and was answering his inquiries for the Dick May of ancient
      times.</p>
     <p>'Poor May! I never saw a man so thrown away. With his talent and acuteness, he might be the
      most eminent man of his day, if he had only known how to use them. But he was always the same
      careless soft-hearted fellow, never knowing how to do himself any good, and he is the same
      still, not a day older nor wiser. It was a fatal thing for him that there was that country
      practice ready for him to step into, and even of that he does not make as good a thing as he
      might. Of course he married early, and there he is, left a widower with a house full of
      children—screaming babies, and great tall sons growing up, and he without a notion what he
      shall do with them, as heedless as ever—saving nothing of course. I always knew it was what he
      would come to, if he would persist in burying himself in that wretched little country town,
      but I hardly thought, after all he has gone through, to find him such a mere boy still. And
      yet he is one of the cleverest men I ever met—with such talent, and such thorough knowledge of
      his profession, that it does one good to hear him talk. Poor May! I am sorry for him, he might
      have been anything, but that early marriage and country practice were the ruin of him.'</p>

     <p>Sir Matthew Fleet's visit seemed like a turning-point with the May family, rousing
      and giving them revived hopes. Norman began to shake off his extreme languor and depression,
      the Doctor was relieved from much of the wearing suffering from his hurt, and his despondency
      as to Margaret's ultimate recovery had been driven away. The experiment of taking her up
      succeeded so well, that on Sunday she was fully attired, 'fit to receive company.' As she lay
      on the sofa there seemed an advance toward recovery. Much sweet coquetry was expended in
      trying to look her best for her father; and her best was
      <pb n="130"/> very well, for though the brilliant bloom of health was gone, her cheeks had not
      lost their pretty rounded contour, and still had some rosiness, while her large bright blue
      eyes smiled and sparkled. A screen shut out the rest of the room, making a sort of little
      parlour round the fire, where sundry of the family were visiting her after coming home from
      Church in the afternoon. Ethel was in a vehement state of indignation at what had that day
      happened at school. 'Did you ever hear anything like it! When the point was, to teach the poor
      things to be Christians, to turn them back, because their hair was not regulation length!'</p>
     <p>'What's that! Who did?' said Dr. May, coming in from his own room, where he had heard a few
      words.</p>
     <p>'Mrs. Ledwich. She sent back three of the Cocksmoor children this morning. It seems she
      warned them last Sunday without saying a word to us.'</p>
     <p>'Sent them back from Church,' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'Not exactly from Church,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'It is the same in effect,' said Ethel, 'to turn them from school; for if they did try to go
      alone, the pew-openers would drive them out.'</p>
     <p>'It is a wretched state of things!' said Dr. May, who never wanted much provocation to begin
      storming about parish affairs. 'When I am churchwarden again, I'll see what can be done about
      the seats; but it's no sort of use, while Ramsden goes on as he does.'</p>
     <p>'Now my poor children are done for!' said Ethel. 'They will never come again. And it's
      horrid, papa; there are lots of town children who wear immense long plaits of hair, and Mrs.
      Ledwich never interferes with them. It is entirely to drive the poor Cocksmoor ones away—for
      nothing else, and all out of Fanny Anderson's chatter.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, my dear,' said Margaret, pleadingly.</p>
     <p>'Didn't I tell you, Margaret, how, as soon as Flora knew what Mrs. Ledwich was going to do,
      she went and told her this was the children's only chance, and if we affronted them for a
      trifle, there would be no hope of getting them back. She said she was sorry, if we were
      interested for them, but rules must not be broken; and when Flora spoke of all who do wear
      long hair unmolested, she shuffled and said, for the sake of the teachers, as well as the
      other children, rags and dirt could not be allowed; and then she brought up the old story of
      Miss Boulder's pencil, though she has found it again, and ended by saying Fanny Anderson told
      her it was a serious annoyance to the teachers, and she was sure we should agree with her,
      that something was due to voluntary assistants and subscribers.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid there has been a regular set at them,' said Margaret, 'and perhaps they are
      troublesome, poor things.'</p>
     <pb n="131"/>
     <p>'As if school keeping were for luxury!' said Dr. May. 'It is the worst thing I have heard of
      Mrs. Ledwich yet! One's blood boils to think of those poor children being cast off because our
      fine young ladies are too grand to teach them! The Clergyman leaving his work to a set of
      conceited women, and they turning their backs on ignorance, when it comes to their door.
      Voluntary subscribers, indeed! I've a great mind I'll be one no longer.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa, that would not be fair—' began Ethel; but Margaret knew he would not act on this,
      squeezed her hand, and silenced her.</p>
     <p>'One thing I've said, and I'll hold to it,' continued Dr. May; 'if they outvote Wilmot again
      in your Ladies' Committee, I'll have no more to do with them, as sure as my name's Dick May.
      It is a scandal the way things are done here!'</p>
     <p>'Papa,' said Richard, who had all the time been standing silent, 'Ethel and I have been
      thinking, if you approved, whether we could not do something towards teaching the Cocksmoor
      children, and breaking them in for the Sunday school.'</p>
     <p>What a bound Ethel's heart gave, and how full of congratulation and sympathy was the
      pressure of Margaret's hand!</p>
     <p>'What did you think of doing?' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>Ethel burnt to reply, but her sister's hand admonished her to remember her compact. Richard
      answered, 'We thought of trying to get a room, and going perhaps once or twice a week to give
      them a little teaching. It would be little enough, but it might do something towards
      civilizing them, and making them wish for more.'</p>
     <p>'How do you propose to get a room?'</p>
     <p>'I have reconnoitred, and I think I know a cottage with a tolerable kitchen, which I dare
      say we might hire for an afternoon for sixpence.'</p>
     <p>Ethel, unable to bear it any longer, threw herself forward, and sitting on the ground at her
      father's feet, exclaimed, 'O papa! papa! do say we may!'</p>
     <p>'What's all this about?' said the Doctor, surprised.</p>
     <p>'Oh! you don't know how I have thought of it day and night these two months!'</p>
     <p>'What! Ethel, have a fancy for two whole months, and the whole house not hear of it!' said
      her father, with a rather provoking look of incredulity.</p>
     <p>'Richard was afraid of bothering you, and wouldn't let me. But do speak, papa. May we?'</p>
     <p>'I don't see any objection.'</p>
     <p>She clasped her hands in ecstacy. 'Thank you! thank you, papa! O Ritchie! Oh! Margaret!'
      cried she, in a breathless voice of transport.</p>
     <p>'You have worked yourself up to a fine pass,' said the Doctor,
      <pb n="132"/> patting the agitated girl fondly as she leant against his knee. 'Remember, slow
      and steady.'</p>
     <p>'I've got Richard to help me,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Sufficient guarantee,' said her father, smiling archly as he looked up to his son, whose
      fair face had coloured deep red. 'You will keep the Unready in order, Ritchie.'</p>
     <p>'He does,' said Margaret; 'he has taken her education into his hands, and I really believe
      he has taught her to hold up her frock and stick in pins.'</p>
     <p>'And to know her right hand from her left, Eh, Ethel? Well, you deserve some credit, then.
      Suppose we ask Mr. Wilmot to tea, and talk it over.'</p>
     <p>'O thank you, papa! When shall it be? To-morrow?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, if you like. I have to go to the town-council meeting, and am not going into the
      country, so I shall be in early.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you. O how very nice!'</p>
     <p>'And what about cost? Do you expect to rob me?'</p>
     <p>'If you would help us,' said Ethel, with an odd shy manner; 'we meant to make what we have
      go as far as may be, but mine is only fifteen and sixpence.'</p>
     <p>'Well, you must make interest with Margaret for the turn-out of my pocket to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, we are very much obliged,' said the brother and sister, earnestly, 'that is more
      than we expected.'</p>
     <p>'Ha! don't thank too soon. Suppose to-morrow should be a blank day.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, it won't!' said Ethel. 'I shall tell Norman to make you go to paying people'</p>
     <p>'There's avarice!' said the Doctor. 'But look you here, Ethel, if you'll take my advice,
      you'll make your bargain for Tuesday. I have a note appointing me to call at Abbotstoke Grange
      on Mr. Rivers, at twelve o'clock, on Tuesday. What do you think of that, Ethel? An old banker,
      rich enough for his daughter to curl her hair in bank notes. If I were you, I'd make a bargain
      for him.'</p>
     <p>'If he had nothing the matter with him, and I only got one guinea out of him!'</p>
     <p>'Prudence! Well, it may be wiser.'</p>
     <p>Ethel ran up to her room, hardly able to believe that the mighty proposal was made; and it
      had been so readily granted, that it seemed as if Richard's caution had been vain in making
      such a delay, that even Margaret had begun to fear that the street of by-and-by was leading to
      the house of never. Now, however, it was plain that he had been wise. Opportunity was
      everything; at another moment, their father might have been harassed and oppressed, and
      <pb n="133"/> unable to give his mind to concerns, which now he could think of with interest,
      and Richard could not have caught a more favourable conjuncture.</p>
     <p>Ethel was in a wild state of felicity all that evening and the next day, very unlike her
      brother, who, dismayed at the open step he had taken, shrank into himself, and in his shyness
      dreaded the discussion in the evening, and would almost have been relieved, if Mr. Wilmot had
      been unable to accept the invitation. So quiet and grave was he, that Ethel could not get him
      to talk over the matter at all with her, and she was obliged to bestow all her transports and
      grand projects on Flora or Margaret, when she could gain their ears, besides conning them over
      to herself, as an accompaniment to her lessons, by which means she tried Miss Winter's
      patience almost beyond measure. But she cared not—she saw a gathering school and rising
      Church, which eclipsed all thought of present inattentions and gaucheries. She monopolized
      Margaret in the twilight, and rhapsodized to her heart's content, talking faster and faster,
      and looking more and more excited. Margaret began to feel a little overwhelmed, and while
      answering 'yes' at intervals, was considering whether Ethel had not been flying about in an
      absent inconsiderate mood all day, and whether it would seem unkind to damp her ardour, by
      giving her a hint that she was relaxing her guard over herself. Before Margaret had steeled
      herself, Ethel was talking of a story she had read, of a place something like Cocksmoor.
      Margaret was not ready with her recollection, and Ethel, saying it was in a magazine in the
      drawing-room chiffoniere, declared she would fetch it.</p>
     <p>Margaret knew what it was to expect her visitors to return 'in one moment,' and with a
      'now-or-never' feeling she began, 'Ethel dear, wait,' but Ethel was too impetuous to attend.
      'I'll be back in a twinkling,' she called out, and down she flew, in her speed whisking away,
      without seeing it, the basket with Margaret's knitting and all her notes and papers, which lay
      scattered on the floor far out of reach, vexing Margaret at first, and then making her grieve
      at her own impatient feeling.</p>
     <p>Ethel was soon in the drawing-room, but the right number of the magazine was not quickly
      forthcoming, and in searching she became embarked in another story. Just then, Aubrey, whose
      stout legs were apt to carry him into every part of the house where he was neither expected
      nor wanted, marched in at the open door, trying by dint of vehement gestures to make her
      understand, in his imperfect speech, something that he wanted. Very particularly troublesome
      she thought him, more especially as she could not make him out, otherwise than that he wanted
      her to do something with the
      <pb n="134"/> newspaper and the fire. She made a boat for him with an old newspaper, a very
      hasty and frail performance, and told him to sail it on the carpet, and be Mr. Ernescliffe
      going away; and she thought him thus safely disposed of. Returning to her book and her search,
      with her face to the cupboard, and her book held up to catch the light, she was soon lost in
      her story, and thought of nothing more till suddenly roused by her father's voice in the hall,
      loud and peremptory with alarm, 'Aubrey! put that down!' She looked, and beheld Aubrey
      brandishing a great flaming paper—he dropped it at the exclamation—it fell burning on the
      carpet. Aubrey's white pinafore! Ethel was springing up, but in her cramped, twisted position,
      she could not do so quickly, and even as he called, her father strode by her, snatched at
      Aubrey's merino frock, which he crushed over the scarcely lighted pinafore, and trampled out
      the flaming paper with his foot. It was a moment of dreadful fright, but the next assured them
      that no harm was done.</p>
     <p>'Ethel!' cried the Doctor, 'are you mad? What were you thinking of?'</p>
     <p>Aubrey, here recollecting himself enough to be frightened at his father's voice and manner,
      burst into loud cries; the Doctor pressed him closer on his breast, caressed and soothed him.
      Ethel stood by, pale and transfixed with horror. Her father was more angry with her, than she
      had ever seen him, and with reason, as she knew, as she smelt the singeing, and saw a large
      burnt hole in Aubrey's pinafore, while the front of his frock was scorched and brown. Dr.
      May's words were not needed, 'What could make you let him?'</p>
     <p>'I didn't see—' she faultered.</p>
     <p>'Didn't see! Didn't look, didn't think, didn't care! That's it, Ethel. 'Tis very hard one
      can't trust you in a room with the child any more than the baby herself. His frock perfect
      tinder. He would have been burnt to a cinder, if I had not come in!'</p>
     <p>Aubrey roared afresh, and Dr. May, kissing and comforting him, gathered him up in his left
      arm, and carried him away, looking back at the door to say, 'There's no bearing it! I'll put a
      stop to all schools and Greek, if it is to lead to this, and make you good for nothing!'</p>
     <p>Ethel was too much terrified to know where she was, or anything, but that she had let her
      little brother run into fearful peril, and grievously angered her father; she was afraid to
      follow him, and stood still, annihilated, and in despair, till roused by his return; then,
      with a stifled sob, she exclaimed, 'Oh, papa!' and could get no further for a gush of
      tears.</p>
     <p>But the anger of the shock of terror was over, and Dr. May was sorry for her tears, though
      still he could not but manifest some
      <pb n="135"/> displeasure. 'Yes, Ethel,' he said, 'it was a frightful thing,' and he could not
      but shudder again. 'One moment later! It is an escape to be for ever thankful for—poor little
      fellow—but Ethel, Ethel, do let it be a warning to you.'</p>
     <p>'O, I hope—I'll try—sobbed Ethel.</p>
     <p>'You have said you would try before.'</p>
     <p>'I know I have,' said Ethel, choked. 'If I could but—'</p>
     <p>'Poor child,' said Dr. May, sadly; then looking earnestly at her, 'Ethel, my dear, I am
      afraid of its being with you as—as it has been with me;' he spoke very low, and drew her close
      to him. 'I grew up, thinking my inbred heedlessness a sort of grace, so to say, rather
      manly—the reverse of finikin. I was spoilt as a boy, and my Maggie carried on the spoiling, by
      never letting me feel its effects. By the time I had sense enough to regret this as a fault, I
      had grown too old for changing of ingrain, long-nurtured habits— perhaps I never wished it
      really. You have seen,' and his voice was nearly inaudible, 'what my carelessness has come
      to—let that suffice at least, as a lesson that may spare you—what your father must feel as
      long as he lives.'</p>
     <p>He pressed his hand tightly on her shoulder, and left her, without letting her see his face.
      Shocked and bewildered, she hurried upstairs to Margaret. She threw herself on her knees, felt
      her arms round her, and heard her kind soothing, and then, in broken words, told how dreadful
      it had been, and how kind papa had been,and what he had said, which was now the uppermost
      thought. 'Oh! Margaret, Margaret, how very terrible it is! And does papa really think
       <hi>so?</hi> '</p>
     <p>'I believe he does,' whispered Margaret.</p>
     <p>'How can he, can he bear it!' said Ethel, clasping her hands. 'O it is enough to kill one—I
      can't think why it did not!'</p>
     <p>'He bears it,' said Margaret, 'because he is so very good, that help and comfort do come to
      him. Dear papa! He bears up because it is right, and for our sakes, and he has a sort of rest
      in that perfect love they had for each other. He knows how she would wish him to cheer up and
      look to the end, and support and comfort are given to him, I know they are; but oh, Ethel! it
      does make one tremble and shrink, to think what he has been going through this autumn,
      especially when I hear him moving about late at night, and now and then comes a heavy
      groan—whenever any especial care has been on his mind.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was in great distress. 'To have grieved him again!' said she, 'and just as he seemed
      better and brighter! Everything I do turns out wrong, and always will; I can't do anything
      well by any chance.'</p>
     <pb n="136"/>
     <p>'Yes you can, when you mind what you are about.'</p>
     <p>'But I never can—I'm like him, everyone says so, and he says the heedlessness is ingrain,
      and can't be got rid of.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, I don't really think he could have told you so.'</p>
     <p>'I'm sure he said ingrain.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I suppose it is part of his nature, and that you have inherited it, but—' Margaret
      paused—and Ethel exclaimed,</p>
     <p>'He said his was long-nurtured; yes, Margaret, you guessed right, and he said he could not
      change it, and no more can I.'</p>
     <p>'Surely, Ethel, you have not had so many years. You are fifteen instead of forty-six, and it
      is more a woman's work than a man's to be careful. You need not begin to despair. You were
      growing much better; Richard said so, and so did Miss Winter.'</p>
     <p>'What's the use of it, if in one moment it is as bad as ever? And to-day, of all days in the
      year, just when papa had been so very, very kind, and given me more than I asked.'</p>
     <p>'Do you know, Ethel, I was thinking whether dear mamma would not say that was the reason.
      You were so happy, that perhaps you were thrown off your guard.'</p>
     <p>'I should not wonder if that was it,' said Ethel, thoughtfully. 'You know it was a sort of
      probation that Richard put me on. I was to learn to be steady before he spoke to papa, and now
      it seemed to be all settled and right, and perhaps I forgot I was to be careful still.'</p>
     <p>'I think it was something of the kind. I was a little afraid before, and I wish I had tried
      to caution you, but I did not like to seem unkind.'</p>
     <p>'I wish you had,' said Ethel. 'Dear little Aubrey! Oh! if papa had not been there! And I
      cannot think how, as it was, he could contrive to put the fire out, with his one hand, and not
      hurt himself. Margaret, it was terrible. How could I mind so little! Did you see how his frock
      was singed?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa showed it to me. How can we be thankful enough! One thing I hope, that Aubrey was
      well frightened, poor little boy.'</p>
     <p>'I know! I see now!' cried Ethel, 'he must have wanted me to make the fire blaze up, as
      Richard did one evening when we came in and found it low; I remember Aubrey clapping his hands
      and shouting at the flame; but my head was in that unhappy story, and I never had sense to put
      the things together, and reflect that he would try to do it himself. I only wanted to get him
      out of my way, dear little fellow. Oh! dear, how bad it was of me! All from being uplifted,
      and my head turned, as it used to be when we were happier. Oh! I wish Mr. Wilmot was not
      coming!'</p>
     <p>Ethel sat for a long time with her head hidden in Margaret's
      <pb n="137"/> pillow, and her hand clasped by her good elder sister. At last she looked up and
      said, 'O Margaret, I am so unhappy. I see the whole meaning of it now. Do you not? When papa
      gave his consent at last, I was pleased and set up, and proud of my plans. I never recollected
      what a silly, foolish girl I am, and how unfit.— I thought Mr. Wilmot would think great things
      of it—it was all wrong and self-satisfied. I never prayed at all that it might turn out well,
      and so now it won't.'</p>
     <p>'Dearest Ethel, I don't see that. Perhaps it will do all the better for your being humbled
      about it now. If you were wild and high flying, it would never go right.'</p>
     <p>'It's hope is in Richard,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'So it is,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I wish Mr. Wilmot was not coming to-night,' said Ethel again. 'It would serve me right, if
      papa were to say nothing about it.'</p>
     <p>Ethel lingered with her sister till Harry and Mary came up with Margaret's tea, and summoned
      her, and she crept down stairs, and entered the room so quietly, that she was hardly perceived
      behind her boisterous brother. She knew her eyes were in no presentable state, and cast them
      down, and shrank back as Mr. Wilmot shook her hand and greeted her kindly.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot had been wont to come to tea, whenever he had anything to say to Dr. or Mrs. May,
      which was about once in ten or twelve days. He was Mary's godfather, and their most intimate
      friend in the town, and he had often been with them, both as friend and Clergyman, through
      their trouble—no later than Christmas-Day, he had come to bring the feast of that day to
      Margaret in her sick room. Indeed, it had been chiefly for the sake of the Mays that he had
      resolved to spend the holidays at Stoneborogh, taking the care of Abbotstoke, while his
      brother, the Vicar, went to visit their father. This was, however, the first time he had come
      in his old familiar way to spend an evening, and there was something in the resumption of
      former habits that painfully marked the change.</p>
     <p>Ethel, on coming in, found Flora making tea, her father leaning back in his great chair in
      silence, Richard diligently cutting bread, and Blanche sitting on Mr. Wilmot's knee,
      chattering fast and confidentially. Flora made Harry dispense the cups, and called everyone to
      their places; Ethel timidly glanced at her father's face, as he rose and came into the light.
      She thought the lines and hollows were more marked than ever, and that he looked fatigued and
      mournful, and she felt cut to the heart; but he began to exert himself, and to make
      conversation, not, however, about Cocksmoor, but asking Mr. Wilmot what his brother thought of
      his new squire, Mr. Rivers.</p>
     <pb n="138"/>
     <p>'He likes him very much,' said Mr. Wilmot. 'He is a very pleasing person, particularly
      kind-hearted and gentle, and likely to do a great deal for the parish. They have been giving
      away beef and blankets at a great rate this Christmas.'</p>
     <p>'What family is there?' asked Flora.</p>
     <p>'One daughter, about Ethel's age, is there with her governess. He has been twice married,
      and the first wife left a son, who is in the dragoons, I believe. This girl's mother was Lord
      Cosham's daughter.'</p>
     <p>So the talk lingered on, without much interest or life. It was rather keeping from saying
      nothing than conversation, and no one was without the sensation that she was missing, round
      whom all had been free and joyous—not that she had been wont to speak much herself, but
      nothing would go on smoothly or easily without her. So long did this last, that Ethel began to
      think her father meant to punish her by not beginning the subject that night, and though she
      owned that she deserved it, she could not help being very much disappointed.</p>
     <p>At length, however, her father began: 'We wanted you to talk over a scheme that these young
      ones have been concocting. You see, I am obliged to keep Richard at home this next term—it
      won't do to have no one in the house to carry poor Margaret. We can't do without him any way,
      so he and Ethel have a scheme of seeing what can be done for that wretched place,
      Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed!' said Mr. Wilmot, brightening and looking interested. 'It is sadly destitute. It
      would be a great thing if anything could be done for it. You have brought some children to
      school already, I think. I saw some rough-looking boys, who said they came from
      Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>This embarked the Doctor in the history of the ladies being too fine to teach the poor
      Cocksmoor girls, which he told with kindling vehemence and indignation, growing more animated
      every moment, as he stormed over the wonted subject of the bad system of management —ladies'
      committee—negligent incumbent—incumbent—insufficient clergy —misappropriated tithes—while Mr.
      Wilmot, who had mourned over it, within himself, a hundred times already, and was doing a
      Curate's work on sufferance, with no pay, and little but mistrust from Mr. Ramsden, and absurd
      false reports among the more foolish part of the town, sat listening patiently, glad to hear
      the Doctor in his old strain, though it was a hopeless matter for discussion, and Ethel
      dreaded that the lamentation would go on till bed-time, and Cocksmoor be quite forgotten.</p>
     <p>After a time they came safely back to the project, and Richard was called on to explain.
      Ethel left it all to him, and he with rising colour, and quiet, unhesitating, though diffident
      manner, detailed
      <pb n="139"/> designs that showed themselves to have been well matured. Mr. Wilmot heard,
      cordially approved, and, as all agreed that no time was to be lost, while the holidays lasted,
      he undertook to speak to Mr. Ramsden on the subject the next morning, and if his consent to
      their schemes could be gained, to come in the afternoon to walk with Richard and Ethel to
      Cocksmoor, and set their affairs in order. All the time Ethel said not a word, except when
      referred to by her brother; but when Mr. Wilmot took leave, he shook her hand warmly, as if he
      was much pleased with her. 'Ah!' she thought, 'if he knew how ill I have behaved! It is all
      show and hollowness with me.'</p>
     <p>She did not know that Mr. Wilmot thought her silence one of the best signs for the plan, nor
      how much more doubtful he would have thought her perseverance, if he had seen her wild and
      vehement. As it was, he was very much pleased, and when the Doctor came out with him into the
      hall, he could not help expressing his satisfaction in Richard's well-judged, and
      sensibly-described project.</p>
     <p>'Aye, aye!' said the Doctor, 'there's much more in the boy than I used to think. He's a
      capital fellow, and more like his mother than any of them.'</p>
     <p>'He is,' said Mr. Wilmot; 'there was a just, well-weighed sense and soberness in his plans
      that put me in mind of her every moment.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May gave his hand a squeeze, full of feeling, and went up to tell Margaret. She, on the
      first opportunity, told Richard, and made him happier than he had been for months, not so much
      in Mr. Wilmot's words, as in his father's assent to, and pleasure in them.</p>

     <p>'Norman , do you feel up to a long day's work?' said Dr. May, on the following
      morning. 'I have to set off after breakfast to see old Mrs. Gould, and to be at Abbotstoke
      Grange by twelve; then I thought of going to Fordholm, and getting Miss Cleveland to give us
      some luncheon—there are some poor people on the way to look at; and that girl on Far-view
      Hill; and there's another place to call at in coming home. You'll have a good deal of
      <pb n="140"/> sitting in the carriage, holding Whitefoot, so if you think you shall be cold or
      tired, don't scruple to say so, and I'll take Adams to drive me.'</p>
     <p>'No, thank you,' said Norman, briskly. 'This frost is famous.'</p>
     <p>'It will turn to rain, I expect—it is too white,' said the Doctor, looking out at the
      window. 'How will you get to Cocksmoor, good people?'</p>
     <p>'Ethel won't believe it rains unless it is very bad,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>Norman set out with his father, and prosperously performed the expedition, arriving at
      Abbotstoke Grange at the appointed hour.</p>
     <p>'Ha!' said the Doctor, as the iron gates of ornamental scroll work were swung back, 'there's
      a considerable change in this place since I was here last. Well kept up indeed! Not a dead
      leaf left under the old walnuts, and the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen
      gardeners rolling it every day.'</p>
     <p>'And the drive,' said Norman, 'more like a garden walk than a road! But oh! what a splendid
      cedar!'</p>
     <p>'Isn't it! I remember that as long as I remember anything. All this fine rolling of turf,
      and trimming up of the place, does not make much difference to you, old fellow, does it? You
      don't look altered since I saw you last, when old Jervis was letting the place go to rack and
      ruin. So they have a new entrance—very handsome conservatory—flowers—the banker does things in
      style. There,' as Norman helped him off with his plaid, 'wrap yourself up well, don't get
      cold. The sun is gone in, and I should not wonder if the rain were coming after all. I'll not
      be longer than I can help.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May disappeared from his son's sight through the conservatory, where, through the
      plate-glass, the exotics looked so fresh and perfumy, that Norman almost fancied that the
      scent reached him. 'How much poor Margaret would enjoy one of those camellias,' thought he,
      'and these people have bushels of them for mere show. If I were papa, I should be tempted to
      be like Beauty's father, and carry off one. How she would admire it!'</p>
     <p>Norman had plenty of time to meditate on the camellias,and then to turn and speculate on the
      age of the cedar, whether it could have been planted by the monks of Stoneborough Abbey, to
      whom the Grange had belonged, brought from Lebanon by a pilgrim, perhaps; and then he tried to
      guess at the longevity of cedars, and thought of asking Margaret, the botanist of the family.
      Then he yawned, moved the horse a little about, opined that Mr. Rivers must be very prosy, or
      have some abstruse complaint, considered the sky, and augured rain, buttoned another button of
      his rough coat, and thought of Miss Cleveland's dinner. Then he thought there was a very
      <pb n="141"/> sharp wind, and drove about till he found a sheltered place on the lee side of
      the great cedar, looked up at it, and thought it would be a fine subject for verse, if Mr.
      Wilmot knew of it, and then proceeded to consider what he should make of them.</p>
     <p>In the midst he was suddenly roused by the deep-toned note of a dog, and beheld a large
      black Newfoundland dog leaping about the horse in great indignation. 'Rollo! Rollo!' called a
      clear young voice, and he saw two ladies returning from a walk. Rollo, at the first call,
      galloped back to his mistress, and was evidently receiving an admonition, and promising good
      behaviour. The two ladies entered the house, while he lay down on the step, with his lion-like
      paw hanging down, watching Norman with a brilliant pair of hazel eyes. Norman, after a little
      more wondering when Mr. Rivers would have done with his father, betook himself to civil
      demonstrations to the creature, who received them with dignity, and presently, after
      acknowledging with his tail, various whispers of 'Good old fellow,' and 'Here, old Rollo!'
      having apparently satisfied himself that the young gentleman was respectable, he rose, and
      vouchsafed to stand up with his fore-paws in the gig, listening amiably to Norman's delicate
      flatteries. Norman even began to hope to allure him into jumping on the seat; but a great bell
      rang, and Rollo immediately turned round, and dashed off, at full speed, to some back region
      of the house. 'So, old fellow, you know what the dinner-bell means,' thought Norman. 'I hope
      Mr. Rivers is hungry too. Miss Cleveland will have eaten up her whole luncheon, if this old
      bore won't let my father go soon! I hope he is desperately ill—'tis his only excuse! Heigh ho!
      I must jump out to warm my feet soon! There,there's a drop of rain! Well, there's no end to
      it! I wonder what Ethel is doing about Cocksmoor. It is setting in for a wet afternoon!' and
      Norman disconsolately put up his umbrella.</p>
     <p>At last Dr. May and another gentleman were seen in the conservatory, and Norman gladly
      proceeded to clear the seat; but Dr. May called out, 'Jump out, Norman, Mr. Rivers is so kind
      as to ask us to stay to luncheon.'</p>
     <p>With boyish shrinking from strangers, Norman privately wished Mr. Rivers at Jericho, as he
      gave the reins to a servant, and entered the conservatory, where a kindly hand was held out to
      him by a gentleman of about fifty, with a bald smooth forehead, soft blue eyes, and gentle
      pleasant face. 'Is this your eldest son?' said he, turning to Dr. May,—and the manner of both
      was as if they were already well acquainted. 'No, this is my second. The eldest is not quite
      such a long-legged fellow,' said Dr. May. And then followed the question addressed to Norman
      himself, where he was at school.</p>
     <pb n="142"/>
     <p>'At Stoneborough,' said Norman, a little amused at the thought how angry Ethel and Harry
      would be that the paragraph of the county paper, where 'N. W. May' was recorded as prizeman
      and foremost in the examination, had not penetrated even to Abbotstoke Grange, or rather to
      its owner's memory.</p>
     <p>However, his father could not help adding, 'He is the head of the school—a thing we
      Stoneborough men think much of.'</p>
     <p>This, and Mr. Rivers's civil answer, made Norman so hot, that he did not notice much in
      passing through a hall full of beautiful vases, stuffed birds, busts, etc. tastefully
      arranged, and he did not look up till they were entering a handsome dining-room, where a small
      square table was laid out for luncheon near a noble fire.</p>
     <p>The two ladies were there, and Mr. Rivers introduced them as his daughter and Mrs. Larpent.
      It was the most luxurious meal that Norman had ever seen, the plate, the porcelain, and all
      the appointments of the table so elegant, and the viands, all partaking of the Christmas
      character, and of a recherché delicate description quite new to him. He had to serve as his
      father's right hand, and was so anxious to put everything as Dr. May liked it, and without
      attracting notice, that he hardly saw or listened till Dr. May began to admire a fine Claude,
      on the opposite wall, and embarked in a picture discussion. The Doctor had much taste for art,
      and had made the most of his opportunities of seeing paintings during his time of study at
      Paris, and in a brief tour to Italy. Since that time, few good pictures had come in his way,
      and these were a great pleasure to him, while Mr. Rivers, a regular connoisseur, was delighted
      to meet with one who could so well appreciate them. Norman perceived how his father was
      enjoying the conversation, and was much interested both by the sight of the first fine
      paintings he had ever seen, and by the talk about their merits; but the living things in the
      room had more of his attention and observation, especially the young lady who sat at the head
      of the table; a girl about his own age; she was on a very small scale, and seemed to him like
      a fairy, in the airy lightness and grace of her movements, and the blithe gladsomeness of her
      gestures, and countenance. Form and features, though perfectly healthful and brisk, had the
      peculiar finish and delicacy of a miniature painting, and were enhanced by the sunny glance of
      her dark soft smiling eyes. Her hair was in black silky braids, and her dress, with its gaiety
      of well-assorted colour, was positively refreshing to his eye, so long accustomed to the deep
      mourning of his sisters. A little Italian greyhound, perfectly white, was at her side, making
      infinite variations of the line of beauty and grace, with its elegant outline, and S-like
      tail, as it raised its slender nose in hopes of a fragment of bread which she from time to
      time dispensed to it.</p>
     <pb n="143"/>
     <p>Luncheon over, Mr. Rivers asked Dr. May to step into his library, and Norman guessed that
      they had been talking all this time, and had never come to the medical opinion. However, a
      good meal and a large fire made a great difference in his toleration, and, it was so new a
      scene, that he had no objection to a prolonged' waiting, especially when Mrs. Larpent said, in
      a very pleasant tone, 'Will you come into the drawing-room with us?'</p>
     <p>He felt somewhat as if he was walking in enchanted ground as he followed her into the large
      room, the windows opening into the conservatory, the whole air fragrant with flowers, the
      furniture and ornaments so exquisite of their kind, and all such a fit scene for the beautiful
      little damsel, who, with her slender dog by her side, tripped on demurely, and rather shyly,
      but with a certain skipping lightness in her step. A very tall overgrown school-boy did Norman
      feel himself for one bashful moment, when he found himself alone with the two ladies; but he
      was ready to be set at ease by Mrs. Larpent's good-natured manner, when she said something of
      Rollo's discourtesy. He smiled, and answered that he had made great friends with the fine old
      dog, and spoke of his running off to the dinner, at which little Miss Rivers laughed, and
      looked delighted, and began to tell of Rollo's perfections and intelligence. Norman ventured
      to inquire the name of the little Italian, and was told it was Nipen, because it had once
      stolen a cake, much like the wind-spirit in "Feats on the Fiord." Its beauty and tricks were
      duly displayed, and a most beautiful Australian parrot was exhibited. Mrs. Larpent taking full
      interest in the talk, in so lively and gentle a manner, and she and her pretty pupil evidently
      on such sister-like terms, that Norman could hardly believe her to be the governess, when he
      thought of Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>Miss Rivers took up some brown leaves which she was cutting out with scissors, and
      shaping.—'Our holiday work,' said Mrs. Larpent, in answer to the inquiring look of Norman's
      eyes. 'Meta has been making a drawing for her papa, and is framing it in leather work. Have
      you ever seen any?'</p>
     <p>'Never!' and Norman looked eagerly, asking questions, and watching while Miss Rivers cut out
      her ivy leaf and marked its veins, and showed how she copied it from nature. He thanked her,
      saying, 'I wanted to learn all about it, for I thought it would be such nice work for my
      eldest sister.'</p>
     <p>A glance of earnest interest from little Meta's bright eyes at her governess, and Mrs.
      Larpent, in a kind, soft tone that quite gained his heart, asked, 'Is she the invalid?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman. 'New fancy work is a great gain to her.'</p>
     <pb n="144"/>
     <p>Mrs. Larpent's sympathetic questions, and Meta's softening eyes, gradually drew from him a
      great deal about Margaret's helpless state, and her patience, and capabilities, and how
      everyone came to her with all their cares; and Norman, as he spoke, mentally contrasted the
      life, untouched by trouble and care, led by the fair girl before him, with that atmosphere of
      constant petty anxieties round her namesake's couch, at years so nearly the same.</p>
     <p>'How very good she must be,' said little Meta, quickly and softly; and a tear was sparkling
      on her eyelashes.</p>
     <p>'She is indeed,' said Norman, earnestly. 'I don't know what papa would do but for her.'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Larpent asked kind questions whether his father's arm was very painful, and the hopes
      of its cure; and he felt as if she was a great friend already. Thence they came to books.
      Norman had not read for months past, but it happened that Meta was just now reading
      'Woodstock,' with which he was of course familiar; and both grew eager in discussing that and
      several others. Of one, Meta spoke in such terms of delight, that Norman thought it had been
      very stupid of him to let it lie on the table for the last fortnight without looking into
      it.</p>
     <p>He was almost sorry to see his father and Mr. Rivers come in, and hear the carriage ordered,
      but they were not off yet, thought the rain was now only Scotch mist. Mr. Rivers had his most
      choice little pictures still to display, his beautiful early Italian masters, finished like
      illuminations, and over these there was much lingering and admiring. Meta had whispered
      something to her governess, who smiled, and advanced to Norman. Meta wishes to know if your
      sister would like to have a few flowers?' said she.</p>
     <p>No sooner said than done; the door into the conservatory was opened, and Meta, cutting
      sprays of beautiful geranium, delicious heliotrope, fragrant calycanthus, deep blue tree
      violet, and exquisite hothouse ferns; perfect wonders to Norman, who, at each addition to the
      bouquet, exclaimed by turns, 'Oh! thank you,' and 'how she will like it!'</p>
     <p>Her father reached a magnolia blossom from on high, and the quick warm grateful emotion
      trembled in Dr. May's features and voice, as he said, 'It is very kind in you; you have given
      my poor girl a great treat. Thank you with all my heart.'</p>
     <p>Margaret Rivers cast down her eyes, half smiled, and shrank back, thinking she had never
      felt anything like the left-handed grasp, so full of warmth and thankfulness. It gave her
      confidence to venture on the one question on which she was bent. Her father was in the hall,
      showing Norman his Greek nymph; and lifting her eyes to Dr. May's face, then casting them
      down, she coloured
      <pb n="145"/> deeper than ever, as she said, in a stammering whisper, 'O please— if you would
      tell me—do you think—is papa very ill?'</p>
     <p>Dr. May answered in his softest, most re-assuring tones: 'You need not be alarmed about him,
      I assure you. You must keep him from too much business,' he added, smiling; 'make him ride
      with you, and not let him tire himself, and I am sure you can be his best doctor.'</p>
     <p>'But do you think,' said Meta, earnestly looking up, 'do you think he will be quite well
      again?'</p>
     <p>'You must not expect doctors to be absolute oracles,' said he. 'I will tell you what I told
      him—I hardly think his will ever be sound health again, but I see no reason why he should not
      have many years of comfort, and there is no cause for you to disquiet yourself on his
      account—you have only to be careful of him.'</p>
     <p>Meta tried to say 'thank you,' but not succeeding, looked imploringly at her governess, who
      spoke for her. 'Thank you, it is a great relief to have an opinion, for we were not at all
      satisfied about Mr. Rivers.'</p>
     <p>A few words more, and Meta was skipping about like a sprite finding a basket for the
      flowers—she had another shake of the hand, another grateful smile, and 'thank you,' from the
      Doctor; and then, as the carriage disappeared, Mrs. Larpent exclaimed, 'What a very nice
      intelligent boy that was.'</p>
     <p>'Particularly gentlemanlike,' said Mr. Rivers. 'Very clever— the head of the school, as his
      father tells me—and so modest and unassuming—though I see his father is very proud of
      him.'</p>
     <p>'O, I am sure they are so fond of each other,' said Meta; 'didn't you see his attentive ways
      to his father at luncheon. And, papa, I am sure you must like Dr. May, Mr. Wilmot's doctor, as
      much as I said you would.'</p>
     <p>'He is the most superior man I have met with for a long time,' said Mr. Rivers. 'It is a
      great acquisition to find a man of such taste and acquirements in this country neighbourhood,
      when there is not another who can tell a Claude from a Poussin. I declare, when once we began
      talking, there was no leaving off—I have not met a person of so much conversation since I left
      town. I thought you would like to see him, Meta.'</p>
     <p>'I hope I shall know the Miss Mays some time or other.'</p>
     <p>'That is the prettiest little fairy I ever did see!' was Dr. May's remark, as Norman drove
      from the door.</p>
     <p>'How good-natured they are!' said Norman; 'I just said something about Margaret, and she
      gave me all these flowers. How Margaret will be delighted! I wish the girls could see it
      all!'</p>
     <p>'So you got on well with the ladies, did you?'</p>
     <pb n="146"/>
     <p>'They were very kind to me. It was very pleasant!' said Norman, with a tone of enjoyment
      that did his father's heart good.</p>
     <p>'I was glad you should come in. Such a curiosity shop is a sight, and those pictures were
      some of them well worth seeing. That was a splendid Titian.'</p>
     <p>'That cast of the Pallas of the Parthenon—how beautiful it was— I knew it from the picture
      in Smith's dictionary. Mr. Rivers said he would show me all his antiques if you would bring me
      again.'</p>
     <p>'I saw he liked your interest in them. He is a good, kindhearted dilettante sort of old man;
      he has got all the talk of the literary, cultivated society in London, and must find it
      dullish work here.'</p>
     <p>'You liked him, didn't you?'</p>
     <p>'He is very pleasant—I found he knew my old friend, Benson, whom I had not seen since we
      were at Cambridge together, and we got on that and other matters—London people have an art of
      conversation not learnt here, and I don't know how the time slipped away, but you must have
      been tolerably tired of waiting.'</p>
     <p>'Not to signify,' said Norman. 'I only began to think he must be very ill; I hope there is
      not much the matter with him.'</p>
     <p>'I can't say. I am afraid there is organic disease, but I think it may be kept quiet a good
      while yet, and he may have a pleasant life for some time to come, arranging his prints, and
      petting his pretty daughter. He has plenty to fall back upon.'</p>
     <p>'Do you go there again?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, next week. I am glad of it. I shall like to have another look at that little Madonna
      of his—it is the sort of picture that does one good to carry away in one's eye. Whay! Stop.
      There's an old woman in here. It is too late for Fordholm, but these cases won't wait.'</p>
     <p>He went into the cottage, and soon returned, saying, 'Fine new blankets, and a great kettle
      of soup, and such praises of the ladies at the Grange!' And, at the next house, it was the
      same story. 'Well, 'tis no mockery now, to tell the poor creatures they want nourishing food.
      Slices of meat and bottles of port wine rain down on Abbotstoke.'</p>
     <p>A far more talkative journey than usual ensued; the discussion of the paintings and antiques
      was almost equally delightful to the father and son, and lasted till, about a mile from
      Stoneborough, they descried three figures in the twilight.</p>
     <p>'Ha! How are you, Wilmot? So you braved the rain, Ethel. Jump in,' called the Doctor, as
      Norman drew up.</p>
     <p>'I shall crowd you—I shall hurt your arm, papa; thank you.'</p>
     <p>'No, you won't—jump in—there's room for three thread-papers in
      <pb n="147"/> one gig. Why, Wilmot, your brother has a very jewel of a squire! How did you
      fare?'</p>
     <p>'Very well on the whole, was Mr. Wilmot's answer, while Ethel scrambled in, and tried to
      make herself small, an art in which she was not very successful; and Norman gave an
      exclamation of horrified warning, as she was about to step into the flower- basket; then she
      nearly tumbled out again in dismay, and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in, without
      having done any harm, while her father called out to Mr. Wilmot, as they started, 'I say! You
      are coming back to tea with us.'</p>
     <p>That cheerful tone, and the kindness to herself, were a refreshment and revival to Ethel,
      who was still sobered and shocked by her yesterday's adventure, and by the sense of her
      father's sorrowful displeasure. Expecting further to be scolded for getting in so awkwardly,
      she did not venture to volunteer anything, and even when he kindly said, 'I hope you were
      prosperous in your expedition,' she only made answer, in a very grave voice, 'Yes, papa, we
      have taken a very nice tidy room.'</p>
     <p>'What do you pay for it?'</p>
     <p>'Fourpence for each time.'</p>
     <p>'Well, here's for you,' said Dr. May. 'It is only two guineas to-day; that banker at the
      Grange beguiled us of our time, but you had better close the bargain for him, Ethel—he will be
      a revenue for you, for this winter at least.'</p>
     <p>'O thank you, papa,' was all Ethel could say; overpowered by his kindness, and more
      repressed by what she felt so unmerited, than she would have been by coldness, she said few
      words, and preferred listening to Norman, who began to describe their adventures at the
      Grange.</p>
     <p>All her eagerness revived, however, as she sprung out of the carriage, full of tidings for
      Margaret; and it was almost a race between her and Norman to get up-stairs, and unfold their
      separate budgets.</p>
     <p>Margaret's lamp had just been lighted, when they made their entrance, Norman holding the
      flowers on high.</p>
     <p>'Oh! how beautiful, how delicious! For me? Where did you get them?'</p>
     <p>'From Abbotstoke Grange; Miss Rivers sent them to you.'</p>
     <p>'How very kind! What a lovely geranium, and oh, that fern! I never saw anything so choice.
      How came she to think of me?'</p>
     <p>'They asked me in because it rained, and she was making the prettiest things, leather leaves
      and flowers for picture frames. I thought it was work that would just suit you, and learnt how
      to do
      <pb n="148"/> it. That made them ask about you, and it ended by her sending you this
      nosegay.'</p>
     <p>'How very kind everybody is! Well, Ethel, are you come home too?'</p>
     <p>'Papa picked me up—O Margaret, we have found such a nice room, a clean sanded kitchen—'</p>
     <p>'You never saw such a conservatory—'</p>
     <p>'And it is to be let to us for fourpence a time—'</p>
     <p>'The house is full of beautiful things, pictures and statues. Only think of a real Titian,
      and a cast of the Apollo!'</p>
     <p>'Twenty children to begin with, and Richard is going to make some forms.'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Rivers is going to show me all his casts.'</p>
     <p>'O, is he? But only think how lucky we were to find such a nice woman; Mr. Wilmot was so
      pleased with her.'</p>
     <p>Norman found one story at a time was enough, and relinquished the field, contenting himself
      with silently helping Margaret to arrange the flowers, holding the basket for her, and pleased
      with her gestures of admiration. Ethel went on with her history. 'The first place we thought
      of would not do at all; the woman said she would not take half-a-crown a week to have a lot of
      children stabbling about, as she called it; so we went to another house, and there was a very
      nice woman indeed, Mrs. Green, with one little boy, whom she wanted to send to school, only it
      is too far. She says she always goes to Church at Fordholm because it is nearer, and she is
      quite willing to let us have the room. So we settled it, and next Friday we are to begin. Papa
      has given us two guineas, and that will pay for, let me see, a hundred and twenty-six times,
      and Mr. Wilmot is going to give us some books, and Ritchie will print some alphabets. We told
      a great many of the people, and they are so glad. Old Granny Hall said, 'Well, I never!' and
      told the girls they must be as good as gold now the gentlefolks was coming to teach them. Mr.
      Wilmot is coming with us every Friday as long as the holidays last."</p>
     <p>Ethel departed on her father's coming in to ask Margaret if she would like to have a visit
      from Mr. Wilmot. She enjoyed this very much, and he sat there nearly an hour, talking of many
      matters, especially the Cocksmoor scheme, on which she was glad to hear his opinion at first
      hand.</p>
     <p>'I am very glad you think well of it,' she said. 'It is most desirable that something should
      be done for those poor people, and Richard would never act rashly; but I have longed for
      advice whether it was right to promote Ethel's undertaking. I suppose Richard told you how
      bent on it she was, long before papa was told of it.'</p>
     <pb n="149"/>
     <p>'He said it was her great wish, and had been so for a long time past.'</p>
     <p>Margaret, in words more adequate to express the possession the project had gained of Ethel's
      ardent mind, explained the whole history of it. 'I do believe she looks on it as a sort of
      call,' said she, 'and I have felt as if I ought not to hinder her, and yet I did not know
      whether it was right, at her age, to let her undertake so much.'</p>
     <p>'I understand,' said Mr. Wilmot, 'but, from what I have seen of Ethel, I should think you
      had decided rightly. There seems to me to be such a spirit of energy in her, that if she does
      not act, she will either speculate and theorize, or pine and prey on herself. I do believe
      that hard homely work, such as this school-keeping, is the best outlet for what might
      otherwise run to extravagance—more especially as you say the hope of it has already been an
      incentive to improvement in home duties.'</p>
     <p>'That I am sure it has,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Moreover,' said Mr. Wilmot, 'I think you were quite right in thinking that to interfere
      with such a design was unsafe. I do believe that a great deal of harm is done by student
      friends, who dread to let young people do anything out of the common way, and so force their
      aspirations to ferment and turn sour, for, want of being put to use.'</p>
     <p>'Still girls are told they ought to wait patiently, and not to be eager for self-imposed
      duties.'</p>
     <p>'I am not saying that it is not the appointed discipline for the girls themselves,' said Mr.
      Wilmot. If they would submit, and do their best, it would doubtless prove the most beneficial
      thing for them; but it is a trial in which they often fail, and I had rather not be in the
      place of such friends.'</p>
     <p>'It is a great puzzle!' said Margaret, sighing.</p>
     <p>'Ah! I daresay you are often perplexed,' said her friend, kindly.</p>
     <p>'Indeed I am. There are so many little details that I cannot be always teasing papa with,
      and yet which I do believe form the character more than the great events, and I never know
      whether I act for the best. And there are so many of us, so many duties, I cannot half attend
      to any. Lately, I have been giving up almost everything to keep this room quiet for Norman in
      the morning, because he was so much harassed and hurt by bustle and confusion, and I found
      to-day that things have gone wrong in consequence.'</p>
     <p>'You must do the best you can, and try to trust that while you work in the right spirit,
      your failures will be compensated,' said Mr. Wilmot. 'It is a hard trial.'</p>
     <p>'I like your understanding it,' said Margaret, smiling sadly. 'I don't know whether it is
      silly, but I don't like to be pitied for the wrong thing. My being so helpless is what
      everyone laments over;
      <pb n="150"/> but, after all, that is made up to me by the petting and kindness I get from all
      of them: but it is the being mistress of the house, and having to settle for everyone, without
      knowing whether I do right or wrong, that is my trouble.'</p>
     <p>'I am not sure, however, that it is right to call it a trouble, though it is a trial.'</p>
     <p>'I see what you mean,' said Margart. 'I ought to be thankful. I know it is an honour, and I
      am quite sure I should be grieved if they did not all come to me and consult me as they do. I
      had better not have complained, and yet I am glad I did, for I like you to understand my
      difficulties.'</p>
     <p>'And, indeed, I wish to enter into them, and do or say anything in my power to help you. But
      I don't know anything that can be of so much comfort as the knowledge that He who laid the
      burden on you, will help you to bear it.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret, pausing; and then, with a sweet look, though a heavy sigh, she said,
      'It is very odd how things turn out! I always had a childish fancy that I would be useful and
      important, but I little thought how it would be! However, as long as Richard is in the house,
      I always feel secure about the others, and I shall soon be downstairs myself. Don't you think
      dear papa in better spirits?'</p>
     <p>'I thought so to-day—' and here the Doctor returned, talking of Abbotstoke Grange, where he
      had certainly been much pleased. 'It was a lucky chance,' he said, 'that they brought Norman
      in. It was exactly what I wanted to rouse and interest him, and he took it all in so well,
      that I am sure they were pleased with him. I thought he looked a very lanky specimen of too
      much leg and arm when I called him in, but he has such good manners, and is so ready and
      understanding, that they could not help liking him. It was fortunate I had him instead of
      Richard—Ritchie is a very good fellow, certainly, but he had rather look at a steam-engine,
      any day, than at Raffaelle himself.'</p>
     <p>Norman had his turn by-and-by. He came up after tea, reporting that papa was fast asleep in
      his chair, and the others would go on about Cocksmoor till midnight, if they were let alone;
      and made up for his previous yielding to Ethel, by giving, with much animation, and some
      excitement, a glowing description of the Grange, so graphic, that Margaret said she could
      almost fancy she had been there.</p>
     <p>'O Margaret, I wonder if you ever will! I would give something for you to see the beautiful
      conservatory. It is a real bower for a maiden of romance, with its rich green fragrance in the
      midst of winter. It is like a picture in a dream. One could imagine it a fairy land, where no
      care, or grief, or weariness could come, all choice
      <pb n="151"/> beauty and sweetness waiting on the creature within. I can hardly believe that
      it is a real place, and that I have seen it.'</p>
     <p>'Though you have brought these pretty tokens that your fairy is as good as she is fair,'
      said Margaret, smiling.</p>

     <p>In a large family it must often happen, that since every member of it cannot ride
      the same hobby, nor at the same time, their several steeds must sometimes run counter to each
      other; and so Ethel found it, one morning when Miss Winter, having a bad cold, had given her
      an unwonted holiday.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot had sent a large parcel of books for her to choose from for Cocksmoor, but this
      she could not well do without consultation. The multitude bewildered her, she was afraid of
      taking too many or too few, and the being brought to these practical details made her sensible
      that though her schemes were very grand and full for future doings, they passed very lightly
      over the intermediate ground. The ' <hi>Paulò post futurum</hi> ' was a period much more
      developed in her imagination than the future, that the present was flowing into.</p>
     <p>Where was her coadjutor, Richard? Writing notes for papa, and not to be disturbed. She had
      better have waited tranquilly, but this would not suit her impatience, and she ran up to
      Margaret's room. There she found a great display of ivy leaves, which Norman, who had been
      turning half the shops in the town upside down in search of materials, was instructing her to
      imitate in leather work— a regular mania with him, and apparently the same with Margaret.</p>
     <p>In came Ethel. 'Oh! Margaret, will you look at these "First Truths?" Do you think they would
      be easy enough? Shall I take some of the "Parables" and "Miracles" at once, or content myself
      with the book about "Jane Sparks?"'</p>
     <p>'There's some very easy reading in "Jane Sparks," isn't there?
      <pb n="152"/> I would not make the little books from the New Testament too common.'</p>
     <p>'Take care, that leaf has five points,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Shall I bring you up "Jane Sparks" to see? Because then you can judge,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'There, Norman, is that right?—what a beauty! I should like to look over them by-and-by,
      dear Ethel, very much.'</p>
     <p>Ethel gazed and went away, more put out than was usual with her. 'When Margaret has a new
      kind of fancy work,' she thought, 'she cares for nothing else! as if my poor children did not
      signify more than trumpery leather leaves!' She next met Flora.</p>
     <p>'O Flora, see here, what a famous parcel of books Mr. Wilmot has sent us to choose from.'</p>
     <p>'All those!' said Flora, turning them over as they lay heaped on the drawing-room sofa;
      'what a confusion!'</p>
     <p>'See, such a parcel of reading books. I want to know what you think of setting them up with
      "Jane Sparks," as it is week-day teaching.'</p>
     <p>'You will be very tired of hearing those spelt over for ever; they have some nicer books at
      the national school.'</p>
     <p>'What is the name of them? Do you see any of them here?'</p>
     <p>'No, I don't think I do, but I can't wait to look now. I must write some letters. You had
      better put them together a little. If you were to sort them, you would know what is there.
      Now, what a mess they are in.'</p>
     <p>Ethel could not deny it, and began to deal them out in piles, looking somewhat more fitting,
      but still felt neglected and aggrieved, at no one being at leisure but Harry, who was not
      likely to be of any use to her.</p>
     <p>Presently she heard the study door open, and hoped; but though it was Richard who entered
      the room, he was followed by Tom, and each held various books that boded little good to her.
      Miss Winter had, much to her own satisfaction, been relieved from the charge of Tom, whose
      lessons Richard had taken upon himself; and thus Ethel had heard so little about them for a
      long time past, that even in her vexation and desire to have them over, she listened with
      interest, desirous to judge what sort of place Tom might be likely to take in school.</p>
     <p>She did not perceive that this made Richard nervous and uneasy. He had a great dislike to
      spectators of Latin lessons; he never had forgotten an unlucky occasion, some years back, when
      his father was examining him in the Georgics, and he, dull by nature, and duller by confusion
      and timidity, had gone on rendering word for word— <hi>enim</hi> for, <hi>seges</hi> a crop,
       <hi>lini</hi> of mud, <hi>urit</hi> burns, <hi>campum</hi> the field,
      <pb n="153"/>
      <hi>avenæ</hi> a crop of pipe, <hi>urit</hi> burns it, when Norman and Ethel had first warned
      him of the beauty of his translation by an explosion of laughing, when his father had shut the
      book with a bounce, shaken his head in utter despair, and told him to give up all thoughts of
      doing anything—and when Margaret had cried with vexation. Since that time, he had never been
      happy when anyone was in earshot of a lesson; but to-day he had no escape—Harry lay on the rug
      reading, and Ethel sat forlorn over her books on the sofa. Tom, however, was bright enough,
      declined his Greek nouns irreproachably, and construed his Latin so well, that Ethel could not
      help putting in a word or two of commendation, and auguring the third form. 'Do let him off
      the parsing, Ritchie,' said she, coaxingly—'he has said it so well, and I want you so
      much.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid I must not,' said Richard; who, to her surprise, did not look pleased or
      satisfied with the prosperous translation; 'but come, Tom, you shan't have many words, if you
      really know them.'</p>
     <p>Tom twisted and looked rather cross, but when asked to parse the word <hi>viribus</hi> ,
      answered readily and correctly.</p>
     <p>'Very well, only two more— <hi>affuit?</hi> '</p>
     <p>'Third person singular, præter perfect tense of the verb <hi>affo, affis, affui, affere</hi>
      ,' gabbled off Tom with such confidence, that though Ethel gave an indignant jump, Richard was
      almost startled into letting it pass, and disbelieving himself. He remonstrated in a somewhat
      hesitating voice. 'Did you find that in the dictionary,' said he, 'I thought <hi>affui</hi>
      came from <hi>adsum</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'O to be sure, stupid fool of a word, so it does!' said Tom, hastily. 'I had forgot—
       <hi>adsum, ades, affui, adesse</hi> .'</p>
     <p>Richard said no more, but proposed the word <hi>oppositus.</hi></p>
     <p>'Adjective.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was surprised, for she remembered that it was, in this passage, part of a passive
      verb, which Tom had construed correctly, 'it was objected,' and she had thought this very
      creditable to him, whereas he now evidently took it for <hi>opposite;</hi> however, on
      Richard's reading the line, he corrected himself and called it a participle, but did not
      commit himself further, till asked for its derivation.</p>
     <p>'From <hi>oppositor</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'Hallo!' cried Harry, who hitherto had been abstracted in his book, but now turned, raised
      himself on his elbow, and, at the blunder, shook his thick yellow locks, and showed his teeth
      like a young lion.</p>
     <p>'No, now, Tom, pay attention,' said Richard, resignedly. 'If you found out its meaning, you
      must have seen its derivation.'</p>
     <pb n="154"/>
     <p><hi>'Oppositus</hi> ,' said Tom, twisting his fingers, and gazing first at Ethel, then at
      Harry, in hopes of being prompted, then at the ceiling and floor, the while he drawled out the
      word with a whine, 'why, <hi>oppositus</hi> from <hi>op-posor</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'A poser! aint it?' said Harry.</p>
     <p>'Don't Harry, you distract him,' said Richard. 'Come, Tom, say at once whether you know it
      or not—it is of no use to invent.'</p>
     <p>'From <hi>op</hi> —' and a mumble.</p>
     <p>'What? I don't hear— <hi>op</hi> —'</p>
     <p>Tom again looked for help to Harry, who made a mischevious movement of his lips, as if
      prompting, and, deceived by it, he said boldly, 'From <hi>op-possum</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'That's right! let us hear him decline it!' cried Harry, in an ecstasy, ' <hi>Oppossum,
       opottis, opposse</hi> , or <hi>oh-pottery!</hi> '</p>
     <p>'Harry,' said Richard, in a gentle reasonable voice, 'I wish you would be so kind as not to
      stay, if you cannot help distracting him.'</p>
     <p>And Harry, who really had a tolerable share of forbearance and consideration, actually
      obeyed, contenting himself with tossing his book into the air and catching it again, while he
      paused at the door to give his last unsolicited assistance. 'Decline <hi>oppossum</hi> , you
      say. I'll tell you how: <hi>O-possum re-poses</hi> up a gum tree. <hi>O-pot-you-I</hi> will,
      says the <hi>O-posse</hi> of Yankees, come out to <hi>ketch</hi> him. Opossum poses them and
      declines in <hi>O-pot-esse</hi> by any manner of means of <hi>o-potting-di-do-dum</hi> , was
      quite <hi>oppositum-oppositu</hi> , in fact, quite <hi>contrairy</hi> .'</p>
     <p>Richard, with the gravity of a victim, heard this sally of schoolboy wit, which threw Ethel
      back on the sofa in fits of laughing, and declaring that the Opossum declined, not that he was
      declined; but, in the midst of the disturbance thus created, Tom stepped up to her, and
      whispered, 'Do tell me, Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed I shan't,' said she. 'Why don't you say fairly if you don't know?'</p>
     <p>He was obliged to confess his ignorance, and Richard made him conjugate the whole verb
       <hi>opponor</hi> from beginning to end, in which he wanted a good deal of help.</p>
     <p>Ethel could not help saying, 'How did you find out the meaning of that word, Tom, if you
      didn't look out the verb?'</p>
     <p>'I—don't know,' drawled Tom, in the voice, half sullen, half piteous, which he always
      assumed when out of sorts.</p>
     <p>'It is very odd,' she said, decidedly; but Richard took no notice, and proceeded to the
      other lessons, which went off tolerably well, except the arithmetic, where there was some
      great misunderstanding, into which Ethel did not enter for some time. When she did attend, she
      perceived that Tom had brought a right answer, without understanding
      <pb n="155"/> the working of the sum, and that Richard was putting him through it. She began
      to be worked into a state of dismay and indignation at Tom's behaviour, and Richard's calm
      indifference, which made her almost forget Jane Sparks, and long to be alone with Richard; but
      all the world kept coming into the room, and going out, and she could not say what was in her
      mind till after dinner, when, seeing Richard go up into Margaret's room, she ran after him,
      and entering it, surprised Margaret, by not beginning on her books, but saying at once,
      'Ritchie, I wanted to speak to you about Tom. I am sure he shuffled about those lessons.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid he does,' said Richard, much concerned.</p>
     <p>'What, do you mean that it is often so?'</p>
     <p>'Much too often,' said Richard; 'but I have never been able to detect him; he is very sharp,
      and has some underhand way of preparing his lessons that I cannot make out.'</p>
     <p>'Did you know it, Margaret?' said Ethel, astonished not to see her sister looked shocked as
      well as sorry.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret, 'Ritchie and I have often talked it over, and tried to think what was
      to be done.'</p>
     <p>'Dear me! why don't you tell papa? It is such a terrible thing!'</p>
     <p>'So it is,' said Margaret, 'but we have nothing positive or tangible to accuse Tom of; we
      don't know what he does, and have never caught him out.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure he must have found out the meaning of that <hi>oppositum</hi> in some wrong
      way—if he had looked it out, he would only have found opposite. Nothing but <hi>opponor</hi>
      could have shown him the rendering which he made.'</p>
     <p>'That's like what I have said almost every day,' said Richard, 'but there we are—I can't get
      any further.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps he guesses by the context,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'It would be impossible to do so always,' said both the Latin scholars at once.</p>
     <p>'Well, I can't think how you can take it so quietly,' said Ethel. 'I would have told papa
      the first moment, and put a stop to it. I have a great mind to do so, if you won't.</p>
     <p>'Ethel, Ethel, that would never do!' exclaimed Margaret, 'pray don't. Papa would be so
      dreadfully grieved and angry with poor Tom.'</p>
     <p>'Well, so he deserves,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'You don't know what it is to see papa angry,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Dear me, Richard!' cried Ethel, who thought she knew pretty well what his sharp words were.
      'I'm sure papa never was angry with me, without making me love him more, and, at least,
       <hi>want</hi> to be better.'</p>
     <pb n="156"/>
     <p>'You are a girl,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'You are higher spirited, and shake off things faster,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Why, what do you think he would do to Tom?'</p>
     <p>'I think he would be so very angry, that Tom, who, you know, is timid and meek, would be
      dreadfully frightened,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'That's just what he ought to be, frightened out of these tricks.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid it would frighten him into them still more,' said Richard, 'and perhaps give
      him such a dread of my father as would prevent him from ever being open with him.'</p>
     <p>'Besides, it would make papa so very unhappy,' added Margaret. 'Of course, if poor dear Tom
      had been found out in any positive deceit, we ought to mention it at once, and let him be
      punished; but while it is all vague suspicion, and of what papa has such a horror of, it would
      only grieve him, and make him constantly anxious, without, perhaps, doing Tom any good.'</p>
     <p>'I think all that is expediency,' said Ethel, in her bluff, abrupt way.</p>
     <p>'Besides,' said Richard, 'we have nothing positive to accuse him of, and if we had, it would
      be of no use. He will be at school in three weeks, and there he would be sure to shirk, even
      if he left it off here. Everyone does, and thinks nothing of it.'</p>
     <p>'Richard!' cried both sisters, shocked. 'You never did?'</p>
     <p>'No, we didn't, but most others do, and not bad fellows either. It is not the way of boys to
      think much of those things.'</p>
     <p>'It is mean—it is dishonourable—it is deceitful!' cried Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I know it is very wrong, but you'll never get the general run of boys to think so,' said
      Richard.</p>
     <p>'Then Tom ought not to go to school at all till he is well armed against it,' said
      Ethel.</p>
     <p>That can't be helped,' said Richard. 'He will get clear of it in time, when he knows
      better.'</p>
     <p>'I will talk to him,' said Margaret, 'and, indeed, I think it would be better than worrying
      papa.'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Ethel, 'of course I shan't tell, because it is not my business, but I think
      papa ought to know everything about us, and I don't like your keeping anything back. It is
      being almost as bad as Tom himself.'</p>
     <p>With which words, as Flora entered, Ethel marched out of the room in displeasure, and went
      down, resolved to settle Jane Sparks by herself.</p>
     <p>'Ethel is out of sorts to-day,' said Flora. 'What's the matter?'</p>
     <p>'We have had a discussion,' said Margaret. 'She has been
      <pb n="157"/> terribly shocked by finding out what we have often thought about poor little
      Tom, and she thinks we ought to tell papa. Her principle is quite right, but I doubt—'</p>
     <p>'I know exactly how Ethel would do it!' cried Flora; 'blurt out all on a sudden, "Papa, Tom
      cheats at his lessons!" then there would be a tremendous uproar, papa would scold Tom till he
      almost frightened him out of his wits, and then find out it was only suspicion.</p>
     <p>'And never have any comfort again,' said Margaret. 'He would always dread that Tom was
      deceiving him, and then think it was all for want of—O no, it will never do to speak of it,
      unless we find out some positive piece of misbehaviour.'</p>
     <p>'Certainly,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'And it would do Tom no good to make him afraid of papa,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Ethel's rule is right in principle,' said Margaret, thoughtfully, that papa ought to know
      all without reserve, and yet it will hardly do in practice. One must use discretion, and not
      tease him about every little thing. He takes them so much to heart, that he would be almost
      distracted; and, with so much business abroad, I think, at home he should have nothing but
      rest, and, as far as we can, freedom from care and worry. Anything wrong about the children
      brings on <hi>the</hi> grief so much, that I cannot bear to mention it.'</p>
     <p>Richard and Flora agreed with her, admiring the spirit which made her, in her weakness and
      helplessness, bear the whole burthen of family cares alone, and devote herself entirely to
      spare her father. He was, indeed, her first object, and she would have sacrificed anything to
      give him ease of mind; but, perhaps, she regarded him more as a charge of her own, than as, in
      very truth, the head of the family. She had the government in her hands, and had never been
      used to see him exercise it much in detail (she did not know how much her mother had referred
      to him in private), and had succeeded to her authority at a time when his health and spirits
      were in such a state as to make it doubly needful to spare him. It was no wonder that she
      sometimes carried her consideration beyond what was strictly right, and forgot that he was the
      real authority, more especially as his impulsive nature sometimes carried him away, and his
      sound judgment was not certain to come into play at the first moment, so that it required some
      moral courage to excite displeasure, so easy of manifestation; and of such courage there was,
      perhaps, a deficiency in her character. Nor had she yet detected her own satisfaction in being
      the first with everyone in the family.</p>
     <p>Ethel was put out, as Flora had discovered, and when she was down stairs she found it out,
      and accused herself of having been
      <pb n="158"/> cross to Margaret, and unkind to Tom—of wishing to be a tell-tale. But still,
      though displeased with herself, she was dissatisfied with Margaret; it might be right, but it
      did not agree with her notions. She wanted to see everyone uncompromising, as girls of fifteen
      generally do; she had an intense disgust and loathing of underhand ways, could not bear to
      think of Tom's carrying them on, and going to a place of temptation with them uncorrected; and
      she looked up to her father with the reverence and enthusiasm of one like minded.</p>
     <p>She was vexed on another score. Norman came home from Abbotstoke Grange without having seen
      Miss Rivers, but with a fresh basket of choice flowers, rapturous descriptions of Mr. River's
      prints, and a present of an engraving, in shading, such as to give the effect of a cast, of a
      very fine head of Alexander. Nothing was to be thought of but a frame for this—olive, bay,
      laurel, everything appropriate to the conqueror. Margaret and Norman were engrossed in the
      subject, and, to Ethel, who had no toleration for fancy work, who expected everything to be
      either useful or intellectual, this seemed very frivolous. She heard her father say how glad
      he was to see Norman interested and occupied, and certainly, though it was only in leather
      leaves, it was better than drooping and attending to nothing. She knew, too, that Margaret did
      it for his sake, but, said Ethel to herself, 'It was very odd that people should find
      amusement in such things. Margaret always had a turn for them, but it was very strange in
      Norman.'</p>
     <p>Then came the pang of finding out that this was aggravated by the neglect of herself; she
      called it all selfishness, and felt that she had had an uncomfortable, unsatisfactory day,
      with everything going wrong.</p>

     <p>Three great events signalized the month of January. The first was, the opening of
      the school at Cocksmoor, whither a cart transported half-a-dozen forms, various books, and
      three dozen plumbuns,
      <pb n="159"/> Margaret's contribution, in order that the school might begin with éclat. There
      walked Mr. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, with Mary, in a jumping capering state of delight, and
      Ethel, not knowing whether she rejoiced. She kept apart from the rest, and hardly spoke, for
      this long probation had impressed her with a sense of responsibility, and she knew that it was
      a great work to which she had set her hand—a work in which she must persevere, and in which
      she could not succeed in her own strength.</p>
     <p>She took hold of Flora's hand, and squeezed it hard, in a fit of shyness, when they came
      upon the hamlet, and saw the children watching for them; and when they reached the house, she
      would fain have shrank into nothing; there was a swelling of heart that seemed to ovewhelm and
      stifle her, and the effect of which was to keep her standing unhelpful, when the others were
      busy bringing in the benches and settling the room.</p>
     <p>It was a tidy room, but it seemed very small when they ranged the benches, and opened the
      door to the seven-and-twenty children, and the four or five women who stood waiting. Ethel
      felt some dismay when they all came pushing in, without order or civility, and would have been
      utterly at a loss what to do with her scholars now she had got them, if Richard and Flora had
      not marshalled them to the benches.</p>
     <p>Rough heads, torn garments, staring vacant eyes, and mouths gaping in shy rudeness—it was a
      sight to disenchant her of visions of pleasure in the work she had set herself. It was well
      that she had not to take the initiative.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot said a few simple words to the mothers about the wish to teach their children
      what was right, and to do the best at present practicable; and then told the children that he
      hoped they would take pains to be good, and mind what they were taught. Then he desired all to
      kneel down; he said the Collect, 'Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings—' and then the Lord's
      Prayer.</p>
     <p>Ethel felt as if she could bear it better, and was more up to the work after this. Next, the
      children were desired to stand round the room, and Mr. Wilmot tried who could say the
      Catechism—the two biggest, a boy and a girl, had not an idea of it, and the boy looked
      foolish, and grinned at being asked what was his name. One child was tolerably perfect, and
      about half-a-dozen had some dim notions. Three were entirely ignorant of the Lord's Prayer,
      and many of the others did not by any means pronounce the words of it. Jane and Fanny Taylor,
      Rebekah Watts, and Mrs. Green's little boy, were the only ones who, by their own account, used
      morning and evening prayers, though, on further examination, it appeared that Polly and
      <pb n="160"/> Jenny Hall, and some others, were accustomed to repeat the old rhyme about
      'Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,' and Una M'Carthy and her little brother Fergus said something
      that nobody could make out, but which Mr. Wilmot thought had once been an 'Ave Maria.'</p>
     <p>Some few of the children could read, and several more knew their letters. The least ignorant
      were selected to form a first-class, and Mr. Wilmot promised a Prayer-book to the first who
      should be able to repeat the Catechism without a mistake, and a Bible to the first who could
      read a chapter in it.</p>
     <p>Then followed a setting of tasks, varying from a verse of a Psalm, or the first answer in
      the Catechism, down to the distinction between A, B, and C; all to be ready by next Tuesday,
      when, weather permitting, a second lesson was to be given. Afterwards, a piece of advice of
      Margaret's was followed, and Flora read aloud to the assembly the story of 'Margaret
      Fletcher.' To some this seemed to give great satisfaction, especially to Una, but Ethel was
      surprised to see that many, and those not only little ones, talked and yawned. They had no
      power of attention even to a story, and the stillness was irksome to such wild colts. It was
      plain that it was time to leave off, and there was no capacity there which did not find the
      conclusion agreeable, when the basket was opened, and Ethel and Mary distributed the buns,
      with instructions to say 'thank you.'</p>
     <p>The next Tuesday, <hi>some</hi> of the lessons were learnt, Una's perfectly; the big
      ignorant boy came no more; and some of the children had learnt to behave better, while others
      behaved worse; Ethel began to know what she was about; Richard's gentleness was eminently
      successful with the little girls, impressing good manners on them in a marvellous way; and
      Mary's importance and happiness with alphabet scholars, some bigger than herself, were
      edifying. Cocksmoor was fairly launched.</p>
     <p>The next memorable day was that of Margaret's being first carried down-stairs. She had been
      willing to put it off as long as she could, dreading to witness the change below-stairs, and
      feeling, too, that in entering on the family room, without power of leaving it, she was losing
      all quiet and solitude, as well as giving up that monopoly of her father in his evenings,
      which had been her great privilege.</p>
     <p>However, she tried to talk herself into liking it; and was rewarded by the happy commotion
      it caused, though Dr. May was in a state of excitement and nervousness at the prospect of
      seeing her on the stairs, and his attempts to conceal it only made it worse, till Margaret
      knew she should be nervous herself, and wished him out of sight and out of the house till it
      was over, for without him she had full confidence in the coolness and steadiness of Richard,
      <pb n="161"/> and by him it was safely and quietly accomplished. She was landed on the sofa,
      Richard and Flora settling her, and the others crowding round and exclaiming, while the
      newness of the scene and the change gave her a sense of confusion, and she shut her eyes to
      recover her thoughts, but opened them the next instant at her father's exclamation that she
      was overcome, smiled to reassure him, and declared herself not tired, and to be very glad to
      be among them again. But the bustle was oppressive, and her cheerful manner was an effort; she
      longed to see them all gone, and Flora found it out, sent the children for their walk, and
      carried off Ethel and the brothers.</p>
     <p>Dr. May was called out of the room at the same time, and she was left alone. She gazed round
      her, at the room where, four months before, she had seen her mother with the babe in her arms,
      the children clustered round her, her father exulting in his hen-and-chicken daisies, herself
      full of bright undefined hope, radiant with health and activity, and her one trouble such that
      she now knew the force of her mother's words, that it only proved her happiness. It was not
      till that moment that Margaret realized the change; she found her eyes filling with tears, as
      she looked round, and saw the familiar furniture and ornaments.</p>
     <p>They were instantly checked as she heard her father returning, but not so that he did not
      perceive them, and exclaim that it had been too much for her. 'O no—it was only the first
      time,' said Margaret, losing the sense of the painful vacancy in her absorbing desire not to
      distress her father, and thinking only of him as she watched him standing for some minutes
      leaning on the mantel-shelf, with his hand shading his forehead.</p>
     <p>She began to speak as soon as she thought he was ready to have his mind turned away: 'How
      nicely Ritchie managed! He carried me so comfortably and easily. It is enough to spoil me to
      be so deftly waited on.'</p>
     <p>'I'm glad of it,' said Dr. May; 'I am sure the change is better for you;' but he came and
      looked at her still with great solicitude.</p>
     <p>'Ritchie can take excellent care of me,' she continued, most anxious to divert his thoughts.
      'You see it will do very well indeed for you to take Harry to school.'</p>
     <p>'I should like to do so. I should like to see his master, and to take Norman with me,' said
      the Doctor. 'It would be just the thing for him now—we would show him the dockyard, and all
      those matters, and such a thorough holiday would set him up again.'</p>
     <p>'He is very much better.'</p>
     <p>'Much better—he is recovering spirits and tone very fast. That leaf-work of yours came at a
      lucky time. I like to see him looking
      <pb n="162"/> out for a curious fern in the hedge-rows—the pursuit has quite brightened him
      up.'</p>
     <p>'And he does it so thoroughly,' said Margaret. 'Ethel fancies it is rather frivolous of him,
      I believe; but it amuses me to see how men give dignity to what women make trifling. He
       <hi>will</hi> know everything about the leaves, hunts up my botany books, and has taught me a
      hundred times more of the construction and wonders of them than I ever learnt.'</p>
     <p>'Aye,' said the Doctor, 'he has been talking a good deal to me about vegetable chemistry. He
      would make a good scientific botanist, if he were to be nothing else. I should be glad if he
      sticks to it as a pursuit—'tis pretty work, and I should like to have gone further with it, if
      I had ever had time for it.'</p>
     <p>'I dare say he will,' said Margaret. 'It will be very pleasant if he can go with you. How he
      would enjoy the British Museum, if there was time for him to see it! Have you said anything to
      him yet?'</p>
     <p>'No; I waited to see how you were, as it all depends on that.'</p>
     <p>'I think it depends still more on something else; whether Norman is as fit to take care of
      you as Richard is.'</p>
     <p>'That's another point. There's nothing but what he could manage now, but I don't like saying
      anything to him. I know he would undertake anything I wished, without a word, and then,
      perhaps, dwell on it in fancy, and force himself, till it would turn to a perfect misery, and
      upset his nerves again. I'm sorry for it. I meant him to have followed my trade, but he'll
      never do for that. However, he has wits enough to make himself what he pleases, and I dare say
      he will keep at the head of the school after all.'</p>
     <p>'How very good he has been in refraining from restlessness!'</p>
     <p>'It's beautiful!' said Dr. May, with strong emotion. 'Poor boy! I trust he'll not be
      disappointed, and I don't think he will; but I've promised him I won't be annoyed if he should
      lose his place—so we must take especial care not to show any anxiety. However, for this
      matter, Margaret, I wish you would sound him, and see whether it would be more pleasure or
      pain. Only mind you don't let him think that I shall be vexed, if he feels that he can't make
      up his mind; I would not have him fancy that, for more than I can tell.'</p>
     <p>This consultation revived the spirits of both; and the others returning, found Margaret
      quite disposed for companionship. If to her the evening was sad and strange, like a visit in a
      dream to some old familiar haunt, finding all unnatural, to the rest it was delightful. The
      room was no longer dreary, now that there was a centre for care and attentions, and the party
      was no longer broken up—the sense of comfort, cheerfulness, and home-gathering had
      <pb n="163"/> returned, and the pleasant evening household gossip went round the table almost
      as it used to do. Dr. May resumed his old habit of skimming a club book, and imparting the
      cream to the listeners; and Flora gave them some music, a great treat to Margaret, who had
      long only heard its distant sounds.</p>
     <p>Margaret found an opportunity of talking to Norman, and judged favourably. He was much
      pleased at the prospect of the journey, and of seeing a ship, so as to have a clearer notion
      of the scene where Harry's life was to be spent, and though the charge of the arm was a
      drawback, he did not treat it as insurmountable.</p>
     <p>A few days' attendance in his father's room gave him confidence in taking Richard's place,
      and, accordingly, the third important measure was decided on, namely, that he and his father
      should accompany Harry to the naval school, and be absent three nights. Some relations would
      be glad to receive them in London, and Alan Ernescliffe, who was studying steam navigation at
      Woolwich, volunteered to meet them, and go with them to Portsmouth.</p>
     <p>It was a wonderful event; Norman and Harry had never been beyond Whitford in their lives,
      and none of the young ones could recollect their papa's ever going from home for more than one
      night. Dr. May laughed at Margaret for her anxiety and excitement on the subject, and was more
      amused at overhearing Richard's precise directions to Norman over the packing up.</p>
     <p>'Aye, Ritchie,' said the Doctor, as he saw his portmanteau locked, and the key given to
      Norman, 'you may well look grave upon it. You won't see it look so tidy when it comes back
      again, and I believe you are thinking it will be lucky if you see it at all.'</p>
     <p>There was a very affectionate leave-taking of Harry, who, growing rather soft-hearted,
      thought it needful to be disdainful, scolded Mary and Blanche for 'lugging off his
      figure-head,' and assured them they made as much work about it as if he was going to sea at
      once. Then, to put an end to any more embraces, he marched off to the station with Tom, and
      nearly caused the others to be too late, by the search for him that ensued.</p>
     <p>In due time, Dr. May and Norman returned, looking the better for the journey. There was,
      first, to tell of Harry's school and its master, and Alan Ernescliffe's introduction of him to
      a nice-looking boy of his own age; then they were eloquent on the wonders of the dockyard, the
      Victory, the block machinery. And London—while Dr. May went to transact some business, Norman
      had been with Alan at the British Museum, and though he had intended to see half London
      besides, there was no tearing him away from the Elgin marbles; and nothing would serve him,
      but bringing Dr. May the
      <pb n="164"/> next morning to visit the Ninevite bulls. Norman further said, that whereas papa
      could never go out of his house without meeting people who had something to say to him, it was
      the same elsewhere. Six acquaintances he had met unexpectedly in London, and two at
      Portsmouth.</p>
     <p>So the conversation went on all the evening, to the great delight of all. It was more about
      things than people, though Flora inquired after Mr. Ernescliffe, and was told he had met them
      at the station, had been everywhere with them, and had dined at the Mackenzies' each day. 'How
      was he looking?' Ethel asked; and was told pretty much the same as when he went away; and, on
      a further query from Flora, it appeared that an old naval friend of his father's had hopes of
      a ship, and had promised to have him with him, and thereupon warm hopes were expressed that
      Harry might have a berth in the same.</p>
     <p>'And when is he coming here again, papa?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Eh! oh! I can't tell. I say, isn't it high time to ring?'</p>
     <p>When they went up at night, everyone felt that half the say had not been said, and there
      were fresh beginnings on the stairs. Norman triumphantly gave the key to Richard, and then
      called to Ethel: I say, won't you come into my room while I unpack?'</p>
     <p>'O yes, I should like it very much.'</p>
     <p>Ethel sat on the bed, rolled up in a cloak, while Norman undid his bag, announcing at the
      same time: 'Well, Ethel, papa says I may get to my Euripides to-morrow, if I please, and only
      work an hour at a time!'</p>
     <p>'O I am so glad. Then he thinks you quite well?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I am quite well. I hope I've done with nonsense.'</p>
     <p>'And how did you get on with his arm?'</p>
     <p>'Very well—he was so patient, and told me how to manage. You heard that Sir Matthew said it
      had got much better in these few weeks. O here it is! There's a present for you.'</p>
     <p>'O, thank you. From you, or from papa?'</p>
     <p>'This is mine. Papa has a present for everyone in his bag. He said, at last, that a man with
      eleven children hadn't need go to London very often.'</p>
     <p>'And you got this beautiful Lyra Innocentium for me. How very kind of you, Norman. It is
      just what I wished for. Such lovely binding—and those embossed edges to the leaves. Oh! they
      make a pattern as they open! I never saw anything like it.'</p>
     <p>'I saw such a one on Miss Rivers's table, and asked Ernescliffe where to get one like it.
      See here's what my father gave me.'</p>
     <p>'Bishop Ken's Manual. That is in readiness for the Confirmation.'</p>
     <p>'Look. I begged him to put my name, though he said it was a
      <pb n="165"/> pity to do it with his left hand; I didn't like to wait, so I asked him at least
      to write N. W. May, and the date.'</p>
     <p>'And he has added Prov. xxiii. 24, 25. Let me look it out.' She did so, and instead of
      reading it aloud, looked at Norman full of congratulation.</p>
     <p>'How it ought to make one—' and there Norman broke off from the fulness of his heart.</p>
     <p>'I'm glad he put both verses,' said Ethel, presently. 'How pleased with you he must be!'</p>
     <p>A silence while brother and sister both gazed intently at the crooked characters, till at
      last Ethel, with a long breath, resumed her ordinary tone, and said, 'How well he has come to
      write with his left hand now.'</p>
     <p>'Yes. Did you know that he wrote himself to tell Ernescliffe Sir Matthew's opinion of
      Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'No: did he?'</p>
     <p>'Do you know, Ethel,' said Norman, as he knelt on the floor, and tumbled miscellaneous
      articles out of his bag, 'it is my belief that Ernescliffe is in love with her, and that papa
      thinks so.'</p>
     <p>'Dear me!' cried Ethel, starting up. 'That is famous. We should always have Margaret at home
      when he goes to sea!'</p>
     <p>'But mind, Ethel, for your life you must not say one word to any living creature.'</p>
     <p>'O no, I promise you I won't, Norman, if you'll only tell me how you found it out.'</p>
     <p>'What first put it in my head was the first evening, while I was undoing the portmanteau; my
      father leant on the mantel-shelf, and sighed and muttered, 'Poor Ernescliffe! I wish it may
      end well.' I thought he forgot that I was there, so I would not seem to notice, but I soon saw
      it was <hi>that</hi> he meant.'</p>
     <p>'How?' cried Ethel, eagerly.</p>
     <p>'O, I don't know—by Alan's way.'</p>
     <p>'Tell me—I want to know what people do when they are in love.'</p>
     <p>'Nothing particular,' said Norman, smiling.</p>
     <p>'Did you hear him inquire for her? How did he look?'</p>
     <p>'I can't tell. That was when he met us at the station before I thought of it, and I had to
      see to the luggage. But I'll tell you one thing, Ethel; when papa was talking of her to Mrs.
      Mackenzie, at the other end of the room, all his attention went away in an instant from what
      he was saying. And once, when Harry said something to me about her, he started, and looked
      round so earnestly.'</p>
     <p>'O yes—that's like people in books. And did he colour?'</p>
     <p>'No; I don't recollect that he did,' said Norman; 'but I observed he never asked directly
      after her if he could help it, but always
      <pb n="166"/> was trying to lead, in some round-about way, to hearing what she was doing.'</p>
     <p>'Did he call her Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'I watched; but to me he always said, "Your sister," and if he had to speak of her to papa,
      he said, "Miss May." And then you should have seen his attention to papa. I could hardly get a
      chance of doing anything for papa.'</p>
     <p>'O I am sure of it!' cried Ethel, clasping her hands. 'But, poor man, how unhappy he must
      have been at having to go away when she was so ill!'</p>
     <p>'Aye, the last time he saw her was when he carried her up-stairs.'</p>
     <p>'O dear! I hope he will soon come here again!'</p>
     <p>'I don't suppose he will. Papa did not ask him.'</p>
     <p>'Dear me, Norman! Why not? Isn't papa very fond of him? Why shouldn't he come?'</p>
     <p>'Don't you see, Ethel, that would be of no use while poor Margaret is no better. If he
      gained her affections, it would only make her unhappy.'</p>
     <p>'O, but she is much better. She can raise herself up now without help, and sat up ever so
      long this morning, without leaning back on her cushions. She is getting well—you know Sir
      Matthew said she would.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; but I suppose papa thinks they had better say nothing till she is quite well.'</p>
     <p>'And when she is! How famous it will be!'</p>
     <p>'Then there's another thing; he is very poor, you know.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure papa doesn't care about people being rich.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose Alan thinks he ought not to marry, unless he could make his wife
      comfortable.'</p>
     <p>'Look here—it would be all very easy: she should stay with us, and be comfortable here, and
      he go to sea, and get lots of prize money.'</p>
     <p>'And that's what you call domestic felicity!' said Norman, laughing.</p>
     <p>'He might have her when he was at home,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'No, no; that would never do,' said Norman. 'Do you think Ernescliffe is a man that would
      marry a wife for her father to maintain her?'</p>
     <p>'Why, papa would like it very much. He is not a mercenary father in a book.'</p>
     <p>'Hey! what's that?' said a voice, Ethel little expected. 'Contraband talk at contraband
      times? What's this!'</p>
     <p>'Did you hear, papa?' said Ethel, looking down.</p>
     <p>'Only your last words, as I came up to ask Norman what he had
      <pb n="167"/> done with my pocket book. Mind, I ask no impertinent questions; but, if you have
      no objection, I should like to know what gained me the honour of that compliment.'</p>
     <p>'Norman?' said Ethel, interrogatively, and blushing in emulation of her brother, who was
      crimson.</p>
     <p>'I'll find it,' said he, rushing off with a sort of nod and sign, that conveyed to Ethel
      that there was no help for it.</p>
     <p>So, with much confusion, she whispered into her papa's ear that Norman had been telling her
      something he guessed about Mr. Ernescliffe.</p>
     <p>Her father at first smiled, a pleased amused smile. 'Ah! ha! so Master June has his eyes and
      ears open, has he? A fine bit of gossip to regale you with on his return!'</p>
     <p>'He told me to say not one word,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Right—mind you don't,' said Dr. May, and Ethel was surprised to see how sorrowful his face
      became. At the same moment Norman returned, still very red, and said, 'I've put out the
      pocket-book, papa. I think I should tell you I repeated what, perhaps, you did not mean me to
      hear—you talked to yourself something of pitying Ernescliffe.'</p>
     <p>The Doctor smiled again at the boy's high-minded openness, which must have cost an effort of
      self-humiliation. 'I can't say <hi>little</hi> pitchers have long ears, to a May-pole like
      you, Norman,' said he; 'I think I ought rather to apologize for having inadvertently tumbled
      in among your secrets; I assure you I did not come to spy you.'</p>
     <p>'O, no, no, no, <hi>no!</hi> ' repeated Ethel, vehemently. 'Then you didn't mind our talking
      about it?'</p>
     <p>'Of course not, as long as it goes no further. It is the use of sisters to tell them one's
      private sentiments. Is not it, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'And do you really think <hi>it</hi> is <hi>so</hi> , papa?' Ethel could not help
      whispering.</p>
     <p>'I'm afraid it is!' said Dr. May, sighing; then, as he caught her earnest eyes; 'The more I
      see of Alan, the finer fellow I think him, and the more sorry I am for him. It seems
      presumptuous, almost wrong, to think of the matter at all while my poor Margaret is in this
      state; and, if she were well, there are other difficulties which would, perhaps, prevent his
      speaking, or lead to long years of waiting and wearing out hope.'</p>
     <p>'Money?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Aye! Though I so far deserve your compliment, Miss, that I should be foolish enough, if she
      were but well, to give my consent to-morrow, because I could not help it; yet one can't live
      forty-six years in this world without seeing it is wrong to marry without a
      <pb n="168"/> reasonable dependance—and there won't be much among eleven of you. It makes my
      heart ache to think of it, come what may, as far as I can see, and without <hi>her</hi> to
      judge. The only comfort is, that poor Margaret herself knows nothing of it, and is at peace so
      far. It will be ordered for them, anyhow. Good night, my dear.'</p>
     <p>Ethel sought her room, with graver, deeper thoughts of life than she had carried up
      stairs.</p>

     <p>My dear child, what a storm you have had! how wet you must be!' exclaimed Mrs.
      Larpent, as Meta Rivers came bounding up the broad staircase at Abbotstoke Grange.</p>
     <p>'Oh, no; I am quite dry; feel.'</p>
     <p>'Are you sure?' said Mrs. Larpent, drawing her darling into a luxurious bed-room, lighted up
      by a glowing fire, and full of pretty things. 'Here, come and take off your wet things, my
      dear, and Bellairs shall bring you some tea.'</p>
     <p>'I'm dry; I'm warm,' said Meta, tossing off her plumy hat, as she established herself, with
      her feet on the fender. 'But where do you think I have been? You have so much to hear; but
      first— three guesses where we were in the rain?'</p>
     <p>'In the Stoneborough Cloisters, that you wanted to see? My dear, you did not keep your papa
      in the cold there?'</p>
     <p>'No, no; we never got there at all; guess again.'</p>
     <p>'At Mr. Edward Wilmot's?'</p>
     <p>'No!'</p>
     <p>'Could it have been at Dr. May's? Really, then, you must tell me.'</p>
     <p>'There! you deserve a good long story; beginning at the beginning,' said Meta, clapping her
      hands, 'wasn't it curious? as we were coming up the last hill, we met some girls in deep
      mourning,
      <pb n="169"/> with a lady, who looked like their governess. I wondered whether they could be
      Dr. May's daughters, and so it turned out they were. Presently there began to fall little
      square lumps, neither hail, nor snow, nor rain; it grew very cold, and rain came on. It would
      have been great fun, if I had not been afraid papa would catch cold, and he said we would
      canter on to the inn. But, luckily, there was Dr. May walking up the street, and he begged us
      to come into his house. I was so glad! We were tolerably wet, and Dr. May said something about
      hoping the girls were at home; well, when he opened the drawing-room door, there was the poor
      daughter lying on the sofa.'</p>
     <p>'Poor girl! tell me of her.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! you must go and see her; you won't look at her without losing your heart. Papa liked
      her so much—see if he does not talk of her all the evening. She looks the picture of goodness
      and sweetness. Only think of her having some of the Maidenhair and Cape Jessamine still in
      water, that we sent her so long ago. She shall have some flowers every three days. Well, Dr.
      May said, "There is one at least, that is sure to be at home." She felt my habit, and said I
      must go and change it, and she called to a little thing of six, telling her to show me the way
      to Flora. She smiled, and said she wished she could go herself, but Flora would take care of
      me. Little Blanche came and took hold of my hand, chattering away, up we went, up two
      staircases, and at the top of the last stood a girl about seventeen, so pretty! such deep blue
      eyes, and such a complexion! "That's Flora," little Blanche said; "Flora, this is Miss Rivers,
      and she's wet, and Margaret says you are to take care of her."'</p>
     <p>'So that was your introduction?'</p>
     <p>'Yes; we got acquainted in a minute. She took me into her room—such a room! I believe
      Bellairs would be angry if she had such an one; all up in the roof, no fire, no carpet, except
      little strips by the beds; there were three beds. Flora used to sleep there till Miss May was
      ill, and now she dresses there. Yet I am sure they are as much ladies as I am.'</p>
     <p>'You are an only daughter, my dear, and a petted one,' said Mrs. Larpent, smiling. 'There
      are too many of them to make much of, as we do of our Meta.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose so; but I did not know gentlewomen lived in such a way,' said Meta. 'There were
      nice things about, a beautiful inlaid work-box of Flora's, and a rosewood desk, and plenty of
      books, and a Greek book and dictionary were spread open. I asked Flora if they were hers, and
      she laughed and said no; and that Ethel would be much discomposed that I had seen them. Ethel
      keeps up
      <pb n="170"/> with her brother Norman—only fancy! and he at the head of the school. How clever
      she must be!'</p>
     <p>'But, my dear, were you standing in your wet things all this time!'</p>
     <p>'No; I was trying on their frocks, but they trailed on the ground upon me, so she asked if I
      would come and sit by the nursery fire till my habit was dry; and there was the dear little
      good-humoured baby, so fair and pretty. She is not a bit shy, will go to anybody, but, they
      say, she likes no one so well as her brother Norman.'</p>
     <p>'So you had a regular treat of baby nursing.'</p>
     <p>'That I had; I could not part with her, the darling. Flora thought we might take her down,
      and I liked playing with her in the drawing-room and talking to Miss May, till the fly came to
      take us home. I wanted to have seen Ethel; but, only think, papa has asked Dr. May to bring
      Flora some day; how I hope he will!'</p>
     <p>Little Meta having told her story, and received plenty of sympathy, proceeded to dress, and,
      while her maid braided her hair, a musing fit fell upon her. 'I have seen something of life
      to-day,' thought she. 'I had thought of the great difference between us and the poor, but I
      did not know ladies lived in such different ways. I should be very miserable without Bellairs,
      or without a fire in my room. I don't know what I should do if I had to live in that cold,
      shabby den, and do my own hair, yet they think nothing of it, and they are cultivated and
      lady-like! Is it all fancy, and being brought up to it? I wonder if it is right? Yet dear papa
      likes me to have these things, and can afford them. I never knew I was luxurious before, and
      yet I think I must be! One thing I do wish, and that is, that I was of as much use as those
      girls. I ought to be. I am a motherless girl like them, and I ought to be everything to papa,
      just as Miss May is, even lying on the sofa there, and only two years older than I am. I don't
      think I am of any use at all; he is fond of me, of course, dear papa; and if I died, I don't
      know what would become of him, but that's only because I am his daughter—he has only George
      besides to care for. But, really and truly, he would get on as well without me. I never do
      anything for him, but now and then playing to him in the evening, and that not always, I am
      afraid, when I want to be about anything else. He is always petting me, and giving me all I
      want, but I never do anything but my lessons, and going to the school, and the poor people,
      and that is all pleasure. I have so much that I never miss what I give away. I wonder whether
      it is all right. Leonora and Agatha have not so much money to do as they please with—they are
      not so idolized. George said, when he was angry, that papa idolizes me; but they have all
      these comforts and luxuries, and never think of anything but doing what they like. They never
      made me consider
      <pb n="171"/> as these Mays do. I should like to know them more. I do so much want a friend of
      my own age. It is the only want I have. I have tried to make a friend of Leonora, but I
      cannot; she never cares for what I do. If she saw these Mays she would look down on them. Dear
      Mrs. Larpent is better than anyone, but then she is so much older. Flora May shall be my
      friend. I'll make her call me Meta as soon as she comes. When will it be? They day after
      to-morrow?'</p>
     <p>But little Meta watched in vain. Dr. May always came with either Richard or the groom, to
      drive him, and if Meta met him and hoped he would bring Flora next time, he only answered that
      Flora would like it very much, and he hoped soon to do so.</p>
     <p>The truth was, it was no such every day matter as Meta imagined. The larger carriage had
      been broken, and the only vehicle held only the doctor—his charioteer—and in a very minute
      appendage behind, a small son of the gardener, to open gates, and hold the horse.</p>
     <p>The proposal had been one of those general invitations to be fulfilled at any time, and
      therefore easily set aside; and Dr. May, though continually thinking he should like to take
      his girls to Abbotstoke, never saw the definite time for so doing; and Flora herself, though
      charmed with Miss Rivers, and delighted with the prospect of visiting her, only viewed it as a
      distant prospect.</p>
     <p>There was plenty of immediate interest to occupy them at home, to say nothing of the
      increasing employment that Cocksmoor gave to thoughts, legs, and needles. There was the
      commencement of the half-year, when Tom's school-boy life was to begin, and when it would be
      proved whether Norman were able to retain his elevation.</p>
     <p>Margaret had much anxiety respecting the little boy about to be sent into a scene of
      temptation. Her great confidence was in Richard, who told her that boys did many more wrong
      things than were known at home, and yet turned out very well, and that Tom would be sure to
      right himself in the end. Richard had been blameless in his whole school course, but though
      never partaking of the other boy's evil practices, he could not form an independent estimate
      of character, and his tone had been a little hurt, by sharing the school public opinion of
      morality. He thought Stoneborough, and its temptations, inevitable, and only wished to make
      the best of it. Margaret was afraid to harass her father, by laying the case before him. All
      her brothers had gone safely through the school, and it never occurred to her that it was
      possible that, if her father knew the bias of Tom's disposition, he might choose, for the
      present; at least, some other mode of education.</p>
     <p>She talked earnestly to Tom, and he listened impatiently. There is an age when boys rebel
      against female rule, and are not yet
      <pb n="172"/> softened by the chivalry of manhood, and Tom was at this time of life. He did
      not like to be lectured by a sister, secretly disputed her right, and, proud of becoming a
      schoolboy, had not the generous deference for her weakness felt by his elder brothers; he was
      all the time peeling a stick, as if to show that he was not attending, and he raised up his
      shoulder pettishly whenever she came to a mention of the religious duty of sincerity. She did
      not long continue her advice, and, much disappointed and concerned, tried to console herself
      with hoping that he might have heeded more than he seemed to do.</p>
     <p>He was placed tolerably high in the school, and Norman, who had the first choice of fags,
      took him instead of Hector Ernescliffe, who had just passed beyond the part of the school
      liable to be fagged. He said he liked school, looked bright when he came home in the evenings,
      and the sisters hoped all was right.</p>
     <p>Everyone was just now anxiously watching Norman, especially his father, who strove in vain
      to keep back all manifestation of his earnest desire to see him retain his post. Resolutely
      did the Doctor refrain from asking any questions when the boys came in, but he could not keep
      his eyes from studying the face, to see whether it bore marks of mental fatigue, and from
      following him about the room, to discover whether he found it necessary, as he had done last
      autumn, to spend the evening in study. It was no small pleasure to see him come in with his
      hand full of horse-chesnut and hazel-buds, and proceed to fetch the microscope and botany
      books, throwing himself eagerly into the study of the wonders of their infant forms, searching
      deeply into them with Margaret, and talking them over with his father, who was very glad to
      promote the pursuit—one in which he had always taken great interest.</p>
     <p>Another night Dr. May was for a moment disturbed by seeing the school-books put out, but
      Norman had only some notes to compare, and while he did so, he was remarking on Flora's music,
      and joining in the conversation so freely as to prove it was no labour to him. In truth, he
      was evidently quite recovered, entirely himself again, except that he was less boyish. He had
      been very lively and full of merry nonsense; but his ardour for play had gone off with his
      high spirits, and there was a manliness of manner, and tone of mind, that made him appear
      above his real age.</p>
     <p>At the end of a fortnight he volunteered to tell his father that all was right. 'I am not
      afraid of not keeping my place,' he said; 'you were quite right, papa. I am more up to my work
      than I was ever before, and it comes to me quite fresh and pleasant. I don't promise to get
      the Randall scholarship, if Forder and Cheviot stay on, but I can quite keep up to the mark in
      school work.'</p>
     <pb n="173"/>
     <p>'That's right,' said Dr. May, much rejoiced. 'Are you sure you do it with ease, and without
      its haunting you at night?'</p>
     <p>'Oh, yes; quite sure. I can't think what has made Dr. Hoxton set us on in such easy things
      this time. It is very lucky for me, for one gets so much less time to oneself as dux.'</p>
     <p>'What! with keeping order?'</p>
     <p>'Aye,' said Norman. 'I fancy they think they may take liberties because I am new and young.
      I must have my eye in all corners of the hall at once, and do my own work by snatches, as I
      can.'</p>
     <p>'Can you make them attend to you?'</p>
     <p>'Why, yes, pretty well, when it comes to the point—"will you, or will you not." Cheviot is a
      great help, too, and has all the weight of being the eldest fellow amongst us.'</p>
     <p>'But still you find it harder work than learning? You had rather have to master the dead
      language than the live tongues?'</p>
     <p>'A pretty deal,' said Norman; then added, 'one knows what to be at with the dead, better
      than with the living; they don't make parties against one. I don't wonder at it. It was very
      hard on some of those great fellows to have me set before them, but I do not think it is fair
      to visit it by putting up the little boys to all sorts of mischief.'</p>
     <p>'Shameful!' said the doctor, warmly; 'but never mind, Norman, keep your temper, and do your
      own duty, and you are man enough to put down such petty spite.'</p>
     <p>'I hope I shall manage rightly,' said Norman; 'but I shall be glad if I can get the Randall
      and get away to Oxford; school is not what it used to be, and if you don't think me too
      young—'</p>
     <p>'No, I don't; certainly not. Trouble has made a man of you, Norman, and you are fitter to be
      with men than boys. In the meantime, if you can be patient with these fellows, you'll be of
      great use where you are. If there had been anyone like you at the head of the school in my
      time, it would have kept me out of no end of scrapes. How does Tom get on? he is not likely to
      fall into this set I trust.'</p>
     <p>'I am not sure,' said Norman; 'he does pretty well on the whole. Some of them began by
      bullying him, and that made him cling to Cheviot and Ernescliffe, and the better party; but
      lately I have thought Anderson, junior, rather making up to him, and I don't know whether they
      don't think that tempting him over to them, would be the surest way of vexing me. I have an
      eye over him, and I hope he may get settled into the steadier sort before next half.'</p>
     <p>After a silence, Norman said; 'papa, there is a thing I can't settle in my own mind. Suppose
      there had been wrong things done when older boys, and excellent ones too, were at the head of
      <pb n="174"/> the school, yet they never interfered, do you think I ought to let it go
      on?'</p>
     <p>'Certainly not, or why is power given to you?'</p>
     <p>'So I thought,' said Norman; 'I can't see it otherwise. I wish I could, for it will be
      horrid to set about it, and they'll think it a regular shame in me to meddle.—O! I know what I
      came into the study for; I want you to be so kind as to lend me your pocket Greek Testament. I
      gave Harry my little one.'</p>
     <p>'You are very welcome. What do you want it for?'</p>
     <p>Norman coloured. 'I met with a sermon the other day that recommended reading a bit of it
      every day, and I thought I should like to try, now the Confirmation is coming. One can always
      have some quiet by getting away into the cloister.'</p>
     <p>'Bless you, my boy! while you go on in this way, I have not much fear but that you'll know
      how to manage.'</p>
     <p>Norman's rapid progress affected another of the household in an unexpected way.</p>
     <p>'Margaret, my dear, I wish to speak to you,' said Miss Winter, re-appearing when Margaret
      thought everyone was gone out walking. She would have said, 'I am very sorry for it'—so
      ominous was the commencement—and her expectations were fulfilled when Miss Winter had solemnly
      seated herself, and taken out her netting. 'I wished to speak to you about deal Ethel,' said
      the governess; 'you know how unwilling I always am to make any complaint, but I cannot be
      satisfied with her present way of going on.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed,' said Margaret. 'I am much grieved to hear this. I thought she had been taking
      great pains to improve.'</p>
     <p>'So she was at one time. I would not by any means wish to deny it, and it is not of her
      learning that I speak, but of a hurried, careless way of doing everything, and an irritability
      at being interfered with.'</p>
     <p>Margaret knew how Miss Winter often tried Ethel's temper, and was inclined to take her
      sister's part. 'Ethel's time is so fully occupied,' she said.</p>
     <p>'That is the very thing that I was going to observe, my dear. Her time is too much occupied,
      and my conviction is, that it is hurtful to a girl of her age.'</p>
     <p>This was a new idea to Margaret, who was silent, longing to prove Miss Winter wrong, and not
      have to see poor Ethel pained by having to relinquish any of her cherished pursuits.</p>
     <p>'You see there is that Cocksmoor,' said Miss Winter. 'You do not know how far off it is, my
      dear; much too great a distance for a young girl to be walking continually in all
      weathers.'</p>
     <p>'That's a question for papa,' thought Margaret.</p>
     <pb n="175"/>
     <p>'Besides,' continued Miss Winter, 'those children engross almost all her time and thoughts.
      She is working for them, preparing lessons, running after them continually. It takes off her
      whole mind from her proper occupations, unsettles her, and I do think it is beyond what befits
      a young lady of her age.'</p>
     <p>Margaret was silent.</p>
     <p>'In addition,' said Miss Winter, 'she is at every spare moment busy with Latin and Greek,
      and I cannot think that to keep pace with a boy of Norman's age and ability can be desirable
      for her.'</p>
     <p>'It is a great deal,' said Margaret, 'but—'</p>
     <p>'I am convinced that she does more than is right,' continued Miss Winter. 'She may not feel
      any ill effects at present, but you may depend upon it, it will tell on her by-and-by.
      Besides, she does not attend to anything properly. At one time she was improving in neatness
      and orderly habits. Now, you surely must have seen how much less tidy her hair and dress have
      been.'</p>
     <p>'I have thought her hair looking rather rough,' said Margaret, disconsolately.</p>
     <p>'No wonder,' said Miss Winter, 'for Flora and Mary tell me she hardly spends five minutes
      over it in the morning, and with a book before her the whole time. If I send her up to make it
      fit to be seen, I meet with looks of annoyance. She leaves her books in all parts of the
      school-room for Marry to put away, and her table drawer is one mass of confusion. Her lessons
      she does well enough, I own, though what I should call much too fast; but have you looked at
      her work lately?'</p>
     <p>'She does not work very well,' said Margaret, who was at that moment, though Miss Winter did
      not know it, re-gathering a poor child's frock that Ethel had gallopped through with more
      haste than good speed.</p>
     <p>'She works a great deal worse than little Blanche,' said Miss Winter, 'and though it may not
      be the fashion to say so in these days, I consider good needlework far more important than
      accomplishments. Well, then, Margaret, I should wish you only just to look at her
      writing.'</p>
     <p>And Miss Winter opened a French exercise book, certainly containing anything but elegant
      specimens of penmanship. Ethel's best writing was an upright, disjointed, niggle, looking more
      like Greek than anything else, except where here and there it made insane efforts to become
      running-hand, and thereby lost its sole previous good quality of legibility, while the lines
      waved about the sheet in almost any direction but the horizontal. The necessity she believed
      herself under of doing what Harry called writing with the end of her nose, and her always
      holding her pen with her
      <pb n="176"/> fingers almost in the ink, added considerably to the difficulty of the
      performance. This being at her best, the worst may be supposed to be indescribable, when
      dashed off in a violent hurry, and considerably garnished with blots. Margaret thought she had
      seen the worst, and was sighing at being able to say nothing for it, when Miss Winter
      confounded her by turning a leaf, and showing it was possible to make a still wilder
      combination of scramble, niggle, scratch, and crookedness—and this was supposed to be an
      amended edition! Miss Winter explained that Ethel had, in an extremely short time, performed
      an exercise in which no fault could be detected except the writing, which was pronounced to be
      too atrocious to be shown up to M. Ballompre. On being desired to write it over again, she had
      obeyed with a very bad grace, and some murmurs about Cocksmoor, and produced the second
      specimen, which, in addition to other defects, had some elisions from arrant carelessness,
      depriving it of its predecessor's merits of being good French.</p>
     <p>Miss Winter had been so provoked, that she believed this to be an effect of ill temper, and
      declared that she should certainly have kept Ethel at home to write it over again, if it had
      not so happened that Dr. May had proposed to walk part of the way with her and Richard, and
      the governess was unwilling to bring her into disgrace with him. Margaret was so grateful to
      her for this forbearance, that it disposed her to listen the more patiently to the same
      representations put in, what Miss Winter fancied, different forms. Margaret was much
      perplexed. She could not but see much truth in what Miss Winter said, and yet she could not
      bear to thwart Ethel, whom she admired with her whole heart; and that dry experience, and
      prejudiced preciseness, did not seem capable of entering into her sister's thirst for learning
      and action. When Miss Winter said Ethel would grow up odd, eccentric, and blue, Margaret was
      ready to answer that she would be superior to everyone; and when the governess urged her to
      insist on Cocksmoor being given up, she felt impatient of that utter want of sympathy for the
      good work.</p>
     <p>All that evening Margaret longed for a quiet time to reflect, but it never came till she was
      in bed; and when she had made up her mind how to speak to Ethel, it was five times harder to
      secure her alone. Even when Margaret had her in the room by herself, she looked wild and
      eager, and said she could not stay, she had some Thucydides, to do.</p>
     <p>'Won't you stay with me a little while, quietly?' said Margaret; 'we hardly ever have one of
      our talks.'</p>
     <p>'I didn't mean to vex you, dear Margaret, I like nothing so well, only we are never alone,
      and I've no time.'</p>
     <pb n="177"/>
     <p>'Pray do spare me a minute, Ethel, for I have something that I must say to you, and I am
      afraid you won't like it—so do listen kindly.'</p>
     <p>'Oh!' said Ethel, 'Miss Winter has been talking to you. I know she said she would tell you
      that she wants me to give up Cocksmoor. You aren't dreaming of it, Margaret!'</p>
     <p>'Indeed, dear Ethel, I should be very sorry, but one thing I am sure of, that there is
      something amiss in your way of going on.'</p>
     <p>'Did she show you that horrid exercise?'</p>
     <p>'Yes.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I know it was baddish writing, but just listen, Margaret. We promised six of the
      children to print them each a verse of a hymn on a card to learn. Ritchie did three, and then
      could not go on, for the book, that the others were in, was lost till last evening, and then
      he was writing for papa. So I thought I would do them before we went to Cocksmoor, and that I
      should squeeze time out of the morning; but I got a bit of Sophocles that was so horridly
      hard, it ate up all my time, and I don't understand it properly now; I must get Norman to tell
      me. And that ran in my head, and made me make a mistake in my sum, and have to begin it again.
      Then, just as I thought I had saved time over the exercise, comes Miss Winter and tells me I
      must do it over again, and scolds me, besides, about the ink on my fingers. She would send me
      up at once to get it off, and I could not find murse and her bottle of stuff for it, so that
      wasted ever so much more time, and I was so vexed that, really and truly, my hand shook, and I
      could not write any better.'</p>
     <p>'No, I thought it looked as if you had been in one of your agonies.'</p>
     <p>'And she thought I did it on purpose, and that made me angry, and so we got into a dispute,
      and away went all the little moment I might have had, and I was forced to go to Cocksmoor as a
      promise breaker!'</p>
     <p>'Don't you think you had better have taken pains at first?'</p>
     <p>'Well, so I did with the sense, but I hadn't time to look at the writing much.'</p>
     <p>'You would have made better speed if you had.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! yes, I know I was wrong, but it is a great plague altogether. Really, Margaret, I
      shan't get Thucydides done.'</p>
     <p>'You must wait a little longer, please, Ethel, for I want to say to you that I am afraid you
      are doing too much, and that prevents you from doing things well, as you were trying to do
      last autumn.'</p>
     <p>'You are not thinking of my not going to Cocksmoor!' cried Ethel, vehemently.</p>
     <pb n="178"/>
     <p>'I want you to consider what is to be done, dear Ethel. You thought, last autumn, a great
      deal of curing your careless habits, now you seem not to have time to attend. You can do a
      great deal very fast, I know, but isn't it a pity to be always in a hurry?'</p>
     <p>'It isn't Cocksmoor that is the reason,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'No: you did pretty well when you began, but you know that was in the holidays, when you had
      no Latin and Greek to do.'</p>
     <p>'O but, Margaret, they won't take so much time when I have once got over the difficulties,
      and see my way, but just now they have put Norman into such a frightfully difficult play, that
      I can hardly get on at all with it, and there's a new kind of Greek verses, too, and I don't
      make out from the book how to manage them. Norman showed me on Saturday, but mine won't be
      right. When I've got over that, I shan't be so hurried.'</p>
     <p>'But Norman will go on to something harder, I suppose.'</p>
     <p>'I dare say I shall be able to do it.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps you might, but I want you to consider if you are not working beyond what can be
      good for anybody. You see Norman is much cleverer than most boys, and you are a year younger;
      and besides doing all his work at the head of the school, his whole business of the day, you
      have Cocksmoor to attend to, and your own lessons, besides reading all the books that come
      into the house. Now isn't that more than is reasonable to expect any head and hands to do
      properly?'</p>
     <p>'But if I can do it?'</p>
     <p>'But can you, dear Ethel? Aren't you always racing from one thing to another, doing them by
      halves, feeling haunted, and then growing vexed?'</p>
     <p>'I know I have been cross lately,' said Ethel, 'but it's the being so bothered.'</p>
     <p>'And why are you bothered? Isn't it that you undertake too much?'</p>
     <p>'What would you have me do?' said Ethel, in an injured, unconvinced voice. 'Not give up my
      children?'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Margaret; 'but don't think me very unkind if I say, suppose you left off trying
      to keep up with Norman.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Margaret! Margaret!' and her eyes filled with tears. 'We have hardly missed doing the
      same every day since the first Latin grammar was put into his hands!'</p>
     <p>'I know it would be very hard,' said Margaret, but Ethel continued, in a piteous tone, a
      little sentimental: 'From <hi>hic hæc hoc</hi> up to Alcaics and <hi>beta</hi> Thukididou we
      have gone on together, and I can't bear to give it up. I'm sure I can—'</p>
     <p>'Stop, Ethel, I really doubt whether you can. Do you know that
      <pb n="179"/> Norman was telling papa, the other day, that it was very odd Dr. Hoxton gave
      them such easy lessons.'</p>
     <p>Ethel looked very much mortified.</p>
     <p>'You see,' said Margaret, kindly, 'we all know that men have more power than women, and I
      suppose the time has come for Norman to pass beyond you. He would not be cleverer than anyone,
      if he could not do more than a girl at home.'</p>
     <p>'He has so much more time for it,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'That's the very thing. Now consider, Ethel. His work, after he goes to Oxford, will be
      doing his very utmost—and you know what an utmost that is. If you could keep up with him at
      all, you must give your whole time and thoughts to it, and when you had done so— if you could
      get all the honours in the University—what would it come to? You can't take a
      first-class.'</p>
     <p>'I don't want one,' said Ethel; 'I only can't bear not to do as Norman does, and I like
      Greek so much.'</p>
     <p>'And for that would you give up being a useful, steady daughter and sister at home? The sort
      of woman that dear mamma wished to make you, and a comfort to papa.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was silent, and large tears were gathering.</p>
     <p>'You own, that that is the first thing?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, faintly.</p>
     <p>'And that it is what you fail in most?'</p>
     <p>'Yes.'</p>
     <p>'Then, Ethel dearest, when you made up your mind to Cocksmoor, you knew those things could
      not be done without a sacrifice?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, but I didn't think it would be this.'</p>
     <p>Margaret was wise enough not to press her, and she sat down and sighed pitifully. Presently
      she said, 'Margaret, if you would only let me leave off that stupid old French, and horrid
      dull reading with Miss Winter, I should have plenty of time for everything; and what does one
      learn by hearing Mary read poetry, she can't understand?'</p>
     <p>'You work, don't you? But indeed, Ethel, don't say that I can let you leave off anything. I
      don't feel as if I had that authority. If it be done at all, it must be by papa's consent, and
      if you wish me to ask him about it, I will, only I think it would vex Miss Winter; and I don't
      think dear mamma would have liked Greek and Cocksmoor to swallow up all the little common
      lady-like things.'</p>
     <p>Ethel made two or three great gulps: 'Margaret, must I give up everything, and forget all my
      Latin and Greek?'</p>
     <p>'I should think that would be a great pity,' said Margaret. 'If you were to give up the
      verse-making, and the trying to do as much
      <pb n="180"/> as Norman, and fix some time in the day—half-an-hour, perhaps, for your Greek—I
      think it might do very well.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Ethel, much relieved; 'I'm glad you don't want me to leave it all off. I
      hope Norman won't be vexed,' she added, looking a little melancholy.</p>
     <p>But Norman had not by any means the sort of sentiment on the subject that she had: 'Of
      course, you know, Ethel,' said he, 'it must have come to this some time or other, and if you
      find those verses too hard, and that they take up too much of your time, you had better give
      them up.'</p>
     <p>Ethel did not like anything to be said to be too hard for her, and was very near pleading
      she only wanted time, but some recollection came across her, and presently she said, 'I
      suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to want to learn more, in one's own way, when one is
      told it is not good for one. I was just going to say I hated being a woman, and having these
      tiresome little trifles—my duty—instead of learning, which is yours, Norman.'</p>
     <p>'I'm glad you did not,' said Norman, 'for it would have been very silly of you; and I assure
      you, Ethel, it is really time for you to stop, or you would get into a regular learned lady,
      and be good for nothing. I don't mean that knowing more than other people would make you so,
      but minding nothing else would.'</p>
     <p>This argument from Norman himself, did much to reconcile Ethel's mind to the sacrifice she
      had made; and when she went to bed, she tried to work out the question in her own mind,
      whether her eagerness for classical learning was a wrong sort of ambition, to know what other
      girls did not, and whether it was right to crave for more knowledge than was thought advisable
      for her. She only bewildered herself, and went to sleep before she had settled anything, but
      that she knew she must make all give way to papa first, and, secondly, to Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile Margaret had told her father what had passed. He was only surprised to hear that
      Ethel had kept up so long with Norman, and thought that it was quite right that she should not
      undertake so much, agreeing more entirely than Margaret had expected with Miss Winter's view,
      that it would be hurtful to body as well as mind.</p>
     <p>'It is perfectly ridiculous to think of her attempting it!' he said. 'I am glad you have put
      a stop to it.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad I have,' said Margaret; 'and dear Ethel behaved so very well. If she had
      resisted, it would have puzzled me very much, I must have asked you to settle it. But it is
      very odd, papa, Ethel is the one of them all who treats me most as if I had real
      <pb n="181"/> authority over her; she lets me scold her, asks my leave, never seems to
      recollect for a moment how little older I am, and how much cleverer she is. I am sure I never
      should have submitted so readily. And that always makes it more difficult to me to direct her;
      I don't like to take upon me with her, because it seems wrong to have her obeying me, as if
      she were a mere child.'</p>
     <p>'She is a fine creature,' said Dr. May, emphatically. 'It just shows the fact, the higher
      the mind, the readier the submission. But you don't mean that you have any difficulty with the
      others?'</p>
     <p>'O no, no. Flora never could need any interference, especially from me, and Mary is a
      thorough good girl. I only meant that Ethel lays herself out to be ruled in quite a remarkable
      way. I am sure, though she does love learning, her real love is for goodness, and for you,
      papa.'</p>
     <p>Ethel would have thought her sacrifice well paid for, had she seen her father's look of
      mournful pleasure.</p>

     <p>The setting sun shone into the great west window of the school at Stoneborough, on
      its bare walls, the master's desks, the forms polished with use, and the square, inky, hacked
      and hewed chests, carved with the names of many generations of boys.</p>
     <p>About six or eight little boys were clearing away the books or papers that they, or those
      who owned them as fags, had left astray, and a good deal of talk and laughing was going on
      among them. 'Ha!' exclaimed one, 'here has Harrison left his book behind him that he was
      showing us the gladiators in!' and, standing by the third master's desk, he turned over a page
      or two of Smith's Antiquities, exclaiming, 'It is full of pictures—here's an old man blowing
      the bellows—'</p>
     <p>'Let me see!' cried Tom May, precipitating himself across the benches and over the desk,
      with so little caution, that there was an
      <pb n="182"/> outcry; and, to his horror, he beheld the ink spilled over Mr. Harrison's book,
      while 'There, August! you've been and done it!' 'You'll catch it!' resounded on all sides.</p>
     <p>'What good will staring with your mouth open do!' exclaimed Edward Anderson, the eldest
      present. 'Here! a bit of blotting paper this moment!'</p>
     <p>Tom, dreadfully frightened, handed a sheet torn from an old paper-case that he had inherited
      from Harry, saying despairingly, 'It won't take it out, will it?'</p>
     <p>'No, little stupid head, but don't you see, I'm stopping it from running down the edges, or
      soaking in. He won't be the wiser till he opens it again at that place.'</p>
     <p>'When he does, he will,' said the bewildered Tom.</p>
     <p>'Let him. It won't tell tales.'</p>
     <p>'He's coming!' cried another boy, 'he is close at the door.'</p>
     <p>Anderson hastily shut the book over the blotting-paper, which he did not venture to retain
      in his hand, dragged Tom down from the desk, and was apparently entirely occupied with
      arranging his own box, when Mr. Harrison came in. Tom crouched behind the raised lid, quaking
      in every limb, conscious he ought to confess, but destitute of resolution to do so, and, in a
      perfect agony as the master went to his desk, took up the book, and carried it away, so
      unconscious, that Larkins, a great wag, only waited till his back was turned, to exclaim, 'Ha!
      old fellow, you don't know what you've got there!'</p>
     <p>'Hollo! May junior, will you never leave off staring?' you won't see a bit further for it,'
      said Edward Anderson, shaking him by the ear; 'come to your senses, and know your
      friends.'</p>
     <p>'He'll open it!' gasped Tom.</p>
     <p>'So he will, but I'd bet ninety to one, it is not at that page, or if he does, it won't tell
      tales, unless, indeed, he happened to see you standing there, crouching and shaking. That's
      the right way to bring him upon you.'</p>
     <p>'But suppose he opens it, and knows who was in school?'</p>
     <p>'What then? D'ye think we can't stand by each other, and keep our own counsel?'</p>
     <p>'But the blotting-paper—suppose he knows that!'</p>
     <p>There was a laugh all round at this, 'as if Harrison knew everyone's blotting-paper!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, but Harry used to write his name all over his—see—and draw union-jacks on it.'</p>
     <p>'If he did, the date is not there. Do you think the ink is going to say March 2nd? Why
      should not July have done it last half?'</p>
     <p>'July would have told if he had,' said Larkins. 'That's no go.'</p>
     <pb n="183"/>
     <p>'Aye! That's the way—the Mays are all like girls—can't keep a secret—not one of them. There,
      I've done more for you than ever one of them would have done—own it—and he strode up to Tom,
      and grasped his wrists, to force the confession from him.'</p>
     <p>'But—but he'll ask when he finds it out—'</p>
     <p>'Let him. We know nothing about it. Don't be coming the good boy over me like your brothers.
      That won't do—I know whose eyes are not too short-sighted to read upside down.'</p>
     <p>Tom shrank and looked abject, clinging to the hope that Mr. Harrison would not open the book
      for weeks, months, or years.</p>
     <p>But the next morning, his heart died within him, when he beheld the unfortunate piece of
      blotting-paper, displayed by Mr. Harrison, with the inquiry whether anyone knew to whom it
      belonged, and what made it worse was, that his sight would not reach far enough to assure him
      whether Harry's name was on it, and he dreaded that Norman or Hector Ernescliffe should
      recognise the nautical designs. However, both let it pass, and no one through the whole school
      attempted to identify it. One danger was past, but the next minute Mr. Harrison opened his
      Smith's Antiquities at the page where stood the black witness. Tom gazed round in despair, he
      could not see his brother's face, but Edward Anderson, from the second form, returned him a
      glance of contemptuous encouragement.</p>
     <p>'This book,' said Mr. Harrison, 'was left in school for a quarter of an hour yesterday. When
      I opened it again, it was in this condition. Do any of you know how it happened?' A silence,
      and he continued, 'Who was in school at the time? Anderson, junior, can you tell me anything
      of it?'</p>
     <p>'No, Sir.'</p>
     <p>'You know nothing of it?'</p>
     <p>'No, Sir.'</p>
     <p>Cold chills crept over Tom, as Mr. Harrison looked round to refresh his memory. 'Larkins, do
      you know how this happened?'</p>
     <p>'No, Sir,' said Larkins, boldly, satisfying his conscience because he had not seen the
      manner of the overthrow.</p>
     <p>'Ernescliffe, were you there?'</p>
     <p>'No, Sir.'</p>
     <p>Tom's timid heart fluttered in dim hope that he had been overlooked, as Mr. Harrison paused,
      then said, 'Remember, it is concealment that is the evil, not the damage to the book. I shall
      have a good opinion ever after of a boy honest enough to confess. May junior, I saw you,' he
      added, hopefully and kindly. 'Don't be afraid to speak out, if you did meet with a
      mischance.'</p>
     <p>Tom coloured and turned pale. Anderson and Larkins grimaced at him, to remind him that they
      had told untruths for his sake, and
      <pb n="184"/> that he must not betray them. It was the justification he wanted; he was
      relieved to fancy himself obliged to tell the direct faslehood, for which a long course of
      petty acted deceits had paved the way, for he was in deadly terror of the effects of
      truth.</p>
     <p>'No, Sir.' He could hardly believe he had said the words, or that they would be so readily
      accepted, for Mr. Harrison had only the impression that he knew who the guilty person was, and
      would not tell, and, therefore, put no more questions to him, but, after a few more vain
      inquiries, was baffled, and gave up the investigation.</p>
     <p>Tom thought he should have been very unhappy; he had always heard that deceit was a heavy
      burthen, and would give continual stings, but he was surprised to find himself very
      comfortable on the whole, and able to dismiss repentance as well as terror. His many underhand
      ways with Richard had taken away the tenderness of his conscience, though his knowledge of
      what was right was clear; and he was quite ready to accept the feeling prevalent at
      Stoneborough, that truth was not made for school-boys.</p>
     <p>The axiom was prevalent, but not universal, and parties were running high. Norman May, who,
      as head boy, had, in play-hours, the responsibility, and almost the authority of a master, had
      taken higher ground than was usual even with the well-disposed; and felt it his duty to check
      abuses and malpractices that his predecessors had allowed. His friend, Cheviot, and the
      right-minded set, maintained his authority with all their might; but Harvey Anderson regarded
      his interference as vexatious, always took the part of the offenders, and opposed him in every
      possible way, thus gathering as his adherents not only the idle and mischievous, but the weak
      and mediocre, and, among this set, there was a positive bitterness of feeling to May, and all
      whom they considered as belonging to him.</p>
     <p>In shielding Tom May and leading him to deceive, the younger Anderson had gained a
      conquest—in him the Mays had fallen from that pinnacle of truth which was a standing reproach
      to the average Stoneborough code—and, from that time, he was under the especial patronage of
      his friend. He was taught the most ingenious arts of saying a lesson without learning it, and
      of showing up other people's tasks; whispers and signs were directed to him to help him out of
      difficulties, and he was sought out and put forward whenever a forbidden pleasure was to be
      enjoyed by stealth. These were his stimulants under a heavy bondage; he was teased and
      frightened, bullied and tormented, whenever it was the fancy of Ned Anderson and his
      associates to make his timidity their sport; he was scorned and ill-treated, and driven, by
      bodily terror, into acts alarming to his conscience, dangerous in their consequence, and
      painful in the perpetration; and yet, among all his sufferings, the little coward
      <pb n="185"/> dreaded nothing so much as truth, though it would have set him free at once from
      this wretched tyranny.</p>
     <p>Excepting on holidays, and at hours when the town-boys were allowed to go home, there were
      strict rules confining all except the sixth form to their bounds, consisting of two large
      courts, and an extensive field bordered by the river and the road. On the opposite side of the
      bridge was a turnpike gate, where the keeper exposed stalls of various eatables, very popular
      among the boys, chiefly because they were not allowed to deal there. Ginger-beer could also be
      procured, and there were suspicions, that the bottles so called, contained something
      contraband.</p>
     <p>'August,' said Norman, as they were coming home from school one evening, 'did I see you
      coming over the bridge?'</p>
     <p>Tom would not answer.</p>
     <p>'So you have been at Ballhatchet's gate? I can't think what could take you there. If you
      want tarts, I am sure poor old Betty's are just as good. What made you go there?'</p>
     <p>'Nothing,' said Tom.</p>
     <p>'Well, mind you don't do it again, or I shall have to take you in hand, which I shall be
      very sorry to do. That man is a regular bad character, and neither my father nor Dr. Hoxton
      would have one of us have anything to do with him, as you know.'</p>
     <p>Tom was in hopes it was over, but Norman went on. 'I am afraid you are getting into a bad
      way. Why won't you mind what I have told you plenty of times before, that no good comes of
      going after Ned Anderson, and Axworthy, and that set. What were you doing with them to-day?'
      but, receiving no answer, he went on. 'You always sulk when I speak to you. I suppose you
      think I have no right to row you, but I do it to save you from worse. You can't <hi>never</hi>
      be found out.' This startled Tom, but Norman had no suspicion. 'If you go on, you will get
      into some awful scrape, and papa will be grieved. I would not, for all the world, have him put
      out of heart about you. Think of him, Tom, and try to keep straight.' Tom would say nothing,
      only reflecting that his elder brother was harder upon him than anyone else would be, and
      Norman grew warmer. 'If you let Anderson junior get hold of you, and teach you his tricks,
      you'll never be good for anything. He seems good-natured now, but he will turn against you, as
      he did with Harry. I know how it is, and you had better take my word, and trust to me and
      straight-forwardness, when you get into a mess.'</p>
     <p>'I'm in no scrape,' said Tom, so doggedly, that Norman lost patience, and spoke with more
      displeasure. 'You will be then, if you go out of bounds, and run Anderson's errands, and shirk
      work. You'd better take care. It is my place to keep order, and I can't
      <pb n="186"/> let you off for being my brother; so remember, if I catch you going to
      Ballhatchet's again, you may make sure of a licking.'</p>
     <p>So the warning closed—Tom more alarmed at the aspect of right, which he fancied terrific,
      and Norman with some compunction at having lost temper and threatened, when he meant to have
      gained him by kindness.</p>
     <p>Norman recollected his threat with a qualm of dismay when, at the end of the week, as he was
      returning from a walk with Cheviot, Tom darted out of the gate-house. He was flying across the
      bridge, with something under his arm, when Norman laid a detaining hand on his collar, making
      a sign at the same time to Cheviot to leave them.</p>
     <p>'What are you doing here?' said Norman, sternly, marching Tom into the field. 'So you've
      been there again. What's that under your jacket?'</p>
     <p>'Only—only what I was sent for,' and he tried to squeeze it under the flap.</p>
     <p>'What is it? a bottle—'</p>
     <p>'Only—only a bottle of ink.'</p>
     <p>Norman seized it, and gave Tom a fierce angry shake, but the indignation was mixed with
      sorrow. 'O Tom, Tom, these fellows have brought you a pretty pass. Who would have thought of
      such a thing from us!'</p>
     <p>Tom cowered, but felt only terror.</p>
     <p>'Speak truth,' said Norman, ready to shake it out of him; 'is this for Anderson junior?'</p>
     <p>Under those eyes flashing with generous, sorrowful wrath, he dared not utter another
      falsehood, but Anderson's threats chained him, and he preferred his thraldom to throwing
      himself on the mercy of his brother who loved him. He would not speak.</p>
     <p>'I am glad it is not for yourself,' said Norman; 'but do you remember what I said, in case I
      found you there again.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! don't, don't!' cried the boy. 'I would never have gone if they had not made me.'</p>
     <p>'Made you?' said Norman, disdainfully, 'how?'</p>
     <p>'They would have thrashed me—they pinched my fingers in the box—they pulled my ears—Oh,
      don't—'</p>
     <p>'Poor little fellow!' said Norman; 'but it is your own fault. If you won't keep with me, or
      Ernescliffe, of course they will bully you. But I must not let you off—I must keep my word!'
      Tom cried, sobbed, and implored in vain. 'I can't help it,' he said, 'and now, don't how! I
      had rather no one knew it. It will soon be over. I never thought to have this to do to one of
      us.' Tom roared and struggled, till, releasing him, he said, 'There, that will
      <pb n="187"/> do. Stop bellowing, I was obliged, and I can't have hurt you much, have I?' he
      added more kindly, while Tom went on crying, and turning from him. 'It is nothing to care
      about, I am sure, look up;' and he pulled down his hands. 'Say you are sorry— speak the
      truth—keep with me, and no one shall hurt you again.'</p>
     <p>Very different this from Tom's chosen associates; but he was still obdurate, sullen, and
      angry, and would not speak, nor open his heart to those kind words. After one more, 'I could
      not help it, Tom, you've no business to be sulky,' Norman took up the bottle, opened it,
      smelt, and tasted, and was about to throw it into the river, when Tom exclaimed, 'O don't,
      don't! what will they do to me? give it to me!'</p>
     <p>'Did they give you the money to pay for it?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, let me have it.'</p>
     <p>'How much was it?'</p>
     <p>'Fourpence.'</p>
     <p>'I'll settle that,' and the bottle splashed in the river. 'Now then, Tom, don't brood on it
      any more. Here's a chance for you of getting quit of their errands. If you will keep in my
      sight, I'll take care no one bullies you, and you may still leave off these disgraceful
      tricks, and do well.'</p>
     <p>But Tom's evil spirit whispered that Norman had beaten him, that he should never have any
      diversion again, and that Anderson would punish him; and there was a sort of satisfaction in
      seeing that his perverse silence really distressed his brother.</p>
     <p>'If you will go on in this way, I can't help it, but you'll be sorry some day,' said Norman,
      and he walked thoughtfully on, looking back to see whether Tom were following, as he did
      slowly, meditating on the way, how he should avert his tyrant's displeasure.</p>
     <p>Norman stood for a moment at the door, surveying the court, then walked up to a party of
      boys, and laid his hand on the shoulder of one, holding a silver fourpence to him. 'Anderson
      junior,' said he, 'there's your money. I am not going to let Stoneborough school be turned
      into a gin palace. I give you notice, it is not to be. Now, you are not to bully May junior,
      for telling me. He did not, I found him out.'</p>
     <p>Leaving Anderson to himself he looked for Tom, but not seeing him, he entered the Cloister,
      for it was the hour when he was used to read there, but he could not fix his mind. He went to
      the bench where he had lain, on the examination-day, and kneeling on it, looked out on the
      green grass where the graves were. 'Mother! Mother!' he murmured, 'have I been harsh to your
      poor little tender sickly boy?' I couldn't help it. Oh! if you were but here! We are all going
      wrong! What shall I do? How should Tom be kept from
      <pb n="188"/> this evil?—it is ruining him! mean, false, cowardly, sullen—all that is
      worst—and your son—Oh! Mother! and all I do only makes him shrink more from me. It will break
      my father's heart, and you will not be there to comfort him.'</p>
     <p>Norman covered his face with his hands, and a fit of bitter grief came over him. But his
      sorrow was now not what it had been before his father's resignation had tempered it, and soon
      it turned to prayer, resolution, and hope.</p>
     <p>He would try again to reason quietly with him, when the alarm of detection and irritation
      should have gone off, and he sought for the occasion; but, alas! Tom had learnt to look on all
      reproof as 'rowing,' and considered it as an additional injury from a brother, who, according
      to the Anderson view, should have connived at his offences, and turned a deafened ear and
      dogged countenance to all he said. The foolish boy sought after the Andersons still more, and
      Norman became more dispirited about him, greatly missing Harry, that constant companion and
      follower, who would have shared his perplexities, and removed half of them, in his own part of
      the school, by the influence of his high, courageous, and truthful spirit.</p>
     <p>In the meantime Richard was studying hard at home, with greater hopefulness and vigour than
      he had ever thrown into his work before. 'Suppose,' Ethel had once said to him, 'that when you
      are a Clergyman, you could be Curate of Cocksmoor, when there is a Church there.'</p>
     <p>'When?' said Richard, smiling at the presumption of the scheme, and yet it formed itself
      into a sort of definite hope. Perhaps they might persuade Mr. Ramsden to take him as a Curate
      with a view to Cocksmoor, and this prospect, vague as it was, gave an object and hope to his
      studies. Everyone thought the delay of his examination favourable to him, and he now read with
      a determination to succeed. Dr. May had offered to let him read with Mr. Harrison, but Richard
      thought he was getting on pretty well, with the help Norman gave him; for it appeared that
      ever since Norman's return from London, he had been assisting Richard, who was not above being
      taught by a younger brother; while, on the other hand, Norman, much struck by his humility,
      would not for the world have published that he was fit to act as his elder's tutor.</p>
     <p>One evening, when the two boys came in from school, Tom gave a great start, and, pulling
      Mary by the sleeve, whispered, 'How came that book here?'</p>
     <p>'It is Mr. Harrison's.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I know, but how came it here?'</p>
     <p>'Richard borrowed it to look out something, and Ethel brought it down.'</p>
     <pb n="189"/>
     <p>A little re-assured, Tom took up an exciting story-book, and ensconsed himself by the fire,
      but his agonies were great during the ensuing conversation.</p>
     <p>'Norman,' Ethel was exclaiming in delight, 'do you know this book?'</p>
     <p>'Smith? Yes, it is in the school library.'</p>
     <p>'There's everything in it that one wants, I do believe. Here is such an account of ancient
      galleys—I never knew how they managed their banks of rowers before—Oh! and the Greek
      houses—look at the pictures too.'</p>
     <p>'Some of them are the same as Mr. Rivers' gems,' said Norman, standing behind her, and
      turning the leaves, in search of a favourite.</p>
     <p>'Oh! what did I see? is that ink?' said Flora, from the opposite side of the table.</p>
     <p>'Yes, didn't you hear?' said Ethel. 'Mr. Harrison told Ritchie when he borrowed it, that
      unluckily one day this spring he left it in school, and some of the boys must have upset an
      inkstand over it; but, though he asked them all round, each denied it. How I should hate for
      such things to happen! and it was a prize-book too.'</p>
     <p>While Ethel spoke she opened the marked page, to show the extent of the calamity, and as she
      did so Mary exclaimed, 'Dear me! how funny! why, how did Harry's blotting-paper get in
      there?'</p>
     <p>Tom shrank into nothing, set his teeth, and pinched his fingers, ready to wish they were on
      Mary's throat, more especially as the words made some sensation. Richard and Margaret
      exchanged looks, and their father, who had been reading, sharply raised his eyes and said,
      'Harry's blotting-paper! How do you know that, Mary?'</p>
     <p>'It is Harry's,' said she, all unconscious, 'because of that anchor up in one corner, and
      the union-jack in the other. Don't you see, Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, 'nobody drew that but Harry.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, and there are his buttons,' said Mary, much amused and delighted with these relics of
      her beloved Harry. 'Don't you remember one day last holidays, papa desired Harry to write and
      ask Mr. Ernescliffe what clothes he ought to have for the naval school, and all the time he
      was writing the letter, he was drawing sailor's buttons on his blotting-paper. I wonder how
      ever it got into Mr. Harrison's book!'</p>
     <p>Poor Mary's honest wits did not jump to a conclusion quite so fast as other people's, and
      she little knew what she was doing, when, as a great discovery, she exclaimed, 'I know! Harry
      gave his paper-case to Tom. That's the way it got to school!'</p>
     <pb n="190"/>
     <p>'Tom!' exclaimed his father, suddenly and angrily, 'where are you going?'</p>
     <p>'To bed,' muttered the miserable Tom, twisting his hands. A dead silence of consternation
      fell on all the room. Mary gazed from one to the other, mystified at the effect of her words,
      frightened at her father's loud voice, and at Tom's trembling confusion. The stillness lasted
      for some moments, and was first broken by Flora, as if she had caught at a probability. 'Some
      one might have used the first blotting-paper that came to hand.'</p>
     <p>'Come here, Tom,' said the Doctor, in a voice not loud, but trembling with anxiety; then
      laying his hand on his shoulder, 'Look in my face.' Tom hung his head, and his father put his
      hand under his chin, and raised the pale terrified face.</p>
     <p>'Don't be afraid to tell us the meaning of this. If any of your friends have done it, we
      will keep your secret. Look up, and speak out. How did your blotting-paper come there?'</p>
     <p>Tom had been attempting his former system of silent sullenness, but there was anger at Mary,
      and fear of his father to agitate him, and in his impatient despair at thus being held and
      questioned, he burst out into a violent fit of crying.</p>
     <p>'I can't have you roaring here to distress Margaret,' said Dr. May. 'Come into the study
      with me.'</p>
     <p>But Tom, who seemed fairly out of himself, would not stir, and a screaming and kicking scene
      took place, before he was carried into the study by his brothers, and there left with his
      father. Mary, meantime, dreadfully alarmed, and perceiving that, in some way, she was the
      cause, had thrown herself upon Margaret, sobbing inconsolably, as she begged to know what was
      the matter, and why papa was angry with Tom—had she made him so?</p>
     <p>Margaret caressed and soothed her, to the best of her ability, trying to persuade her that,
      if Tom had done wrong, it was better for him it should be known, and assuring her that no one
      could think her unkind, nor a tell-tale; then dismissing her to bed, and Mary was not
      unwilling to go, for she could not bear to meet Tom again, only begging in a whisper to Ethel,
      'that, if dear Tom had not done it, she would come and tell her.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid there is no hope of that!' sighed Ethel, as the door closed on Mary.</p>
     <p>'After all,' said Flora, 'he has not said anything. If he has only done it, and not
      confessed, that is not so bad—it is only the usual fashion of boys.'</p>
     <p>'Has he been asked? Did he deny it?' said Ethel, looking in Norman's face, as if she hardly
      ventured to put the question, and
      <pb n="191"/> she only received sorrowful signs as answers. At the same moment Dr. May called
      him. No one spoke. Margaret rested her head on the sofa, and looked very mournful, Richard
      stood by the fire without moving limb or feature, Flora worked fast, and Ethel leant back on
      an arm-chair, biting the end of a paper-knife.</p>
     <p>The Doctor and Norman came back together. 'I have sent him up to bed,' said Dr. May. 'I must
      take him to Harrison to-morrow morning. It is a terrible business!'</p>
     <p>'Has he confessed it?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I can hardly call such a thing a confession—I wormed it out bit by bit—I could not tell
      whether he was telling truth or not, till I called Norman in.'</p>
     <p>'But he has not said anything more untrue—'</p>
     <p>'Yes, he has though!' said Dr. May, indignantly. He said Ned Anderson put the paper there,
      and had been taking up the ink with it—'twas his doing—then when I came to cross-examine him,
      I found that though Anderson did take up the ink, it was Tom himself who knocked it down—I
      never heard anything like it—I never could have believed it!'</p>
     <p>'It must all be Ned Anderson's doing!' cried Flora. 'They are enough to spoil anybody.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid they have done him a great deal of harm,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'And what have you been about all the time?' exclaimed the Doctor, too keenly grieved to be
      just. 'I should have thought that with you at the head of the school, the child might have
      been kept out of mischief; but there have you been going your own way, and leaving him to be
      ruined by the very worst set of boys!'</p>
     <p>Norman's colour rose with the extreme pain this unjust accusation caused him, and his voice,
      though low, was not without irritation. 'I <hi>have</hi> tried. I have not done as much as I
      ought, perhaps, but—'</p>
     <p>'No, I think not, indeed!' interrupted his father. 'Sending a boy there, brought up as he
      had been, without the least tendency to deceit—'</p>
     <p>Here no one could see Norman's burning cheeks, and brow bent downwards in the effort to keep
      back an indignant reply, without bursting out in exculpation; and Richard looked up, while the
      three sisters all at once began, 'O no, no, papa—' and left Margaret to finish—'Poor little
      Tom had not always been quite sincere.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed! and why was I left to send him to school without knowing it? The place of all
      others to foster deceit.'</p>
     <p>'It was my fault, papa,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'And mine,' put in Richard; and she continued, 'Ethel told us
      <pb n="192"/> we were very wrong, and I wish we had followed her advice. It was by far the
      best, but we were afraid of vexing you.'</p>
     <p>'Everyone seems to have been combined to hide what they ought not!' said Dr. May, though
      speaking to her much more softly than to Norman, to whom he turned angrily again. 'Pray, how
      came you not to identify this paper?'</p>
     <p>'I did not know it,' said Norman, speaking with difficulty.</p>
     <p>'He ought never to have been sent to school,' said the Doctor, —'that tendency was the very
      worst beginning.'</p>
     <p>'It was a great pity; I was very wrong,' said Margaret, in great concern.</p>
     <p>'I did not mean to blame you, my dear,' said her father, affectionately. 'I know you only
      meant to act for the best, but—' and he put his hand over his face, and then came the sighing
      groan, which pained Margaret ten thousand times more than reproaches, and which, in an
      instant, dispersed all the indignation burning within Norman, though the pain remained at his
      father's thinking him guilty of neglect, but he did not like, at that moment, to speak in
      self-justification.</p>
     <p>After a short space, Dr. May desired to hear what were the deceptions to which Margaret had
      alluded, and made Norman tell what he knew of the affair of the blotted book. Ethel spoke
      hopefully when she had heard it. 'Well, do you know, I think he will do better now. You see,
      Edward made him conceal it, and he has been going on with it on his mind, and in that boy's
      power ever since; but now it is cleared up and confessed, he will begin afresh and do better.
      Don't you think so, Norman? don't you, papa?'</p>
     <p>'I should have more hope, if I had seen anything like confession or repentance,' said Dr.
      May; 'but that provoked me more than all—I could only perceive that he was sorry to be found
      out, and afraid of punishment.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps, when he has recovered the first fright, he will come to his better self,' said
      Margaret; for she guessed, what indeed was the case, that the Doctor's anger on this first
      shock of the discovery of the fault, he most abhorred, had been so great, that a fearful
      cowering spirit would be completely overwhelmed; and, as there had been no sorrow shown for
      the fault, there had been none of that softening and relenting that won so much love and
      confidence.</p>
     <p>Everyone felt that talking only made them more unhappy, they tried to return to their
      occupations, and so passed the time till night. Then, as Richard was carrying Margaret
      upstairs, Norman lingered to say, 'Papa, I am very sorry you should think I neglected Tom. I
      dare say I might have done better for him, but, indeed, I have tried.'</p>
     <pb n="193"/>
     <p>'I am sure you have, Norman. I spoke hastily, my boy—you will not think more of it. When a
      thing like this comes on a man, he hardly knows what he says.'</p>
     <p>'If Harry were here,' said Norman, anxious to turn from the real loss and grief, as well as
      to talk away that feeling of being apologized to, 'it would all do better. He would make a
      link with Tom, but I have so little, naturally, to do with the second form, that it is not
      easy to keep him in sight.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes, I know that very well. It is no one's fault but my own; I should not have sent
      him there without knowing him better. But you see how it is, Norman—I have trusted to her,
      till I have grown neglectful, and it is well if it is not the ruin of him!'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps he will take a turn, as Ethel says,' answered Norman, cheerfully. 'Good night,
      papa.'</p>
     <p>'I have a blessing to be thankful for in you, at least,' murmured the Doctor to himself.
      What other young fellow of that age and spirit would have borne so patiently with my
      injustice? Not I, I am sure! a fine father I show myself to these poor children—neglect,
      helplessness, temper—O Maggie!'</p>
     <p>Margaret had so bad a head-ache, the next day, that she could not come down stairs. The
      punishment was, they heard, a flogging at the time, and an imposition so long, that it was
      likely to occupy a large portion of the play-hours till the end of the half-year. His father
      said, and Norman silently agreed, 'a very good thing, it will keep him out of mischief;' but
      Margaret only wished she could learn it for him, and took upon herself all the blame from
      beginning to end. She said little to her father, for it distressed him to see her grieved; he
      desired her not to dwell on the subject, caressed her, called her his comfort and support, and
      did all he could to console her, but it was beyond his power; her sisters, by listening to
      her, only made her worse. 'Dear, dear papa,' she exclaimed, 'how kind he is! But he can never
      depend upon me again—I have been the ruin of my poor little Tom.'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Richard, quietly. 'I can't see why you should put yourself into such a state
      about it.'</p>
     <p>This took Margaret by surprise. 'Have not I done very wrong, and perhaps hurt Tom for
      life?'</p>
     <p>'I hope not,' said Richard. 'You and I made a mistake, but it does not follow that Tom would
      have kept out of this scrape, if we had told my father our notion.'</p>
     <p>'It would not have been on my conscience,' said Margaret—'he would not have sent him to
      school.'</p>
     <p>'I don't know that,' said Richard. 'At any rate we meant to do right, and only made a
      mistake. It was unfortunate, but I can't
      <pb n="194"/> tell why you go and make yourself ill, by fancying it worse than it is. The boy
      has done very wrong, but people get cured of such things in time, and it is nonsense to fret
      as if he were not a mere child of eight years old. You did not teach him deceit.'</p>
     <p>'No, but I concealed it—papa is disappointed, when he thought he could trust me.'</p>
     <p>'Well! I suppose no one could expect never to make mistakes,' said Richard, in his sober
      tone.</p>
     <p>'Self-sufficiency!' exclaimed Margaret, 'that has been the root of all! Do you know,
      Ritchie, I believe I was expecting that I could always judge rightly.'</p>
     <p>'You generally do,' said Richard; 'no one else could do half what you do.'</p>
     <p>'So you have said, papa, and all of you, till you have spoilt me. I have thought it myself,
      Ritchie.'</p>
     <p>'It is true,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'But then,' said Margaret, 'I have grown to think much of it, and not like to be interfered
      with. I thought I could manage by myself, and when I said I would not worry papa, it was half
      because I liked the doing and settling all about the children myself. Oh! if it could have
      been visited in any way but by poor Tom's faults!'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Richard, 'if you felt so, it was a pity, though I never should have guessed it.
      But you see you will never feel so again, and as Tom is only one, and there are nine to
      govern, it is all for the best.'</p>
     <p>His deliberate common sense made her laugh a little, and she owned he might be right. 'It is
      a good lesson against my love of being first. But indeed it is difficult—papa can so little
      bear to be harassed.'</p>
     <p>'He could not at first, but now he is strong and well, it is different.'</p>
     <p>'He looks terribly thin and worn still,' sighed Margaret, 'so much older!'</p>
     <p>'Aye, I think he will never get back his young looks; but except his weak arm, he is quite
      well.'</p>
     <p>'And then his—his quick way of speaking may do harm.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, that was what I feared for Tom,' said Richard, 'and there was the mistake. I see it
      now. My father always is right in the main, though he is apt to frighten one at first, and it
      is what ought to be, that he should rule his own house. But now, Margaret, it is silly to
      worry about it any more—let me fetch baby, and don't think of it.'</p>
     <p>And Margaret allowed his reasonableness, and let herself be comforted. After all, Richard's
      solid soberness had more influence over her than anything else.</p>

     <p>The first shock of Tom's misdemeanor passed away, though it still gave many an
      anxious thought to such of the family as felt responsible for him.</p>
     <p>The girls were busily engaged in preparing an Easter feast for Cocksmoor. Mr. Wilmot was to
      examine the scholars, and buns and tea were provided, in addition to which Ethel designed to
      make a present to everyone—a great task, considering that the Cocksmoor funds were reserved
      for absolute necessaries, and were at a very low ebb. So that twenty-five gifts were to be
      composed out of nothing!</p>
     <p>There was a grand turn-out of drawers of rubbish, all over Margaret, raising such a cloud of
      dust, as nearly choked her. What cannot rubbish and willing hands effect! Envelopes and wafer
      boxes were ornamented with pictures, bags, needle-cases, and pincushions, beautiful balls,
      tippets, both of list and gay print, and even sun-bonnets and pinafores were contrived, to the
      supreme importance and delight of Mary and Blanche, who found it as good or better than play,
      and ranged their performances in rows, till the room looked like a bazaar. To provide for boys
      was more difficult; but Richard mended old toys, and repaired the frames of slates, and
      Norman's contribution of half-a-crown bought mugs, marbles, and penny knives, and there were
      even hopes that something would remain for bodkins, to serve as nozzles to the bellows, which
      were the pride of Blanche's heart.</p>
     <p>Never were Easter gifts the source of more pleasure to the givers, especially when the
      nursery establishment met Dr. Hoxton near the pastry-cook's shop, and he bestowed on Blanche a
      packet of variegated sugar-plums, all of which she literally poured out at Ethel's feet,
      saying, 'I don't want them. Only let me have one
      <pb n="196"/> for Aubrey, because he is so little. All the rest are for the poor children on
      Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>After this, Margaret declared that Blanche must be allowed to buy the bodkin, and give her
      bellows to Jane Taylor, the only Cocksmoor child she knew, and to whom she always destined in
      turn every gift that she thought most successful.</p>
     <p>So Blanche went with Flora to the toy-shop, and there fell in love with a little
      writing-box, that so eclipsed the bellows, that she tried to persuade Flora to buy it for Jane
      Taylor, to be kept till she could write, and was much disappointed to hear that it was out of
      the question. Just then, a carriage stopped, and from it stepped the pretty little figure of
      Meta Rivers.</p>
     <p>'Oh! how do you? How delightful to meet you! I was wondering if we should! Little Blanche
      too!' kissing her, 'and here's Mrs. Larpent—Mrs. Larpent—Miss Flora May. How is Miss May?'</p>
     <p>This was all uttered in eager delight, and Flora, equally pleased, answered the inquiries.
      'I hope you are not in a hurry,' proceeded Meta, 'I want your advice. You know all about
      schools, don't you? I am come to get some Easter presents for our children, and I am sure you
      can help me.'</p>
     <p>'Are the children little or big?' asked Flora.</p>
     <p>'Oh! all sorts and sizes. I have some books for the great sensible ones, and some stockings
      and shoes for the tiresome stupid ones, but there are some dear little pets that I want nice
      things for. There—there's a doll that looks just fit for little curly-headed Annie Langley,
      don't you think so, Mrs. Larpent?'</p>
     <p>The price of the doll was a shilling, and there were quickly added to it, boxes of toys,
      elaborate bead-work pincushions, polished blue and green boxes, the identical
      writing-case—even a small Noah's ark. Meta hardly asked the prices, which certainly were not
      extravagant, since she had nearly twenty articles for little more than a pound.</p>
     <p>'Papa has given me a benefaction of £5 for my school-gifts,' said she, 'is not that
      charming? I wish you would come to the feast. Now, do! It is on Easter Tuesday. Won't you
      come?'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, I am afraid we can't. I should like it very much.'</p>
     <p>'You never will come to me. You have no compassion.'</p>
     <p>'We should enjoy coming very much. Perhaps, in the summer, when Margaret is better.'</p>
     <p>'Could not she spare any of you? Well, I shall talk to papa, and make him talk to Dr. May.
      Mrs. Larpent will tell you I always get my way. Don't I? Good-bye. See if I don't.'</p>
     <p>She departed, and Flora returned to her own business; but Blanche's interest was gone.
      Dazzled by the more lavish gifts, she looked
      <pb n="197"/> listlessly and disdainfully at bodkins, three for twopence. 'I wish I might have
      bought the writing-box for Jane Taylor! Why does not papa give us money to get pretty things
      for the children?' said she, as soon as they came out.</p>
     <p>'Because he is not so rich as Miss Rivers's papa.'—Flora was interrupted by meeting the Miss
      Andersons, who asked, 'Was not that carriage Mr. Rivers's of Abbotstoke Grange?'</p>
     <p>'Yes. We like Miss Rivers very much,' said Flora, resolved to show that she was
      acquainted.</p>
     <p>'Oh! do you visit her? I knew he was a patient of Dr. May.' Flora thought there was no need
      to tell that the only call had been owing to the rain, and continued, 'She has been begging us
      to come to her school feast, but I do not think we can manage it.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! indeed, the Grange is very beautiful, is it not?'</p>
     <p>'Very,' said Flora. 'Good morning.'</p>
     <p>Flora had a little uneasiness in her conscience, but it was satisfactory to have put down
      Louisa Anderson, who never could aspire to an intimacy with Miss Rivers. Her little sister
      looked up— 'Why, Flora, have you seen the Grange?'</p>
     <p>'No, but papa and Norman said so.'</p>
     <p>And Blanche showed that the practical lesson on the pomps of the world was not lost on her,
      by beginning to wish they were as rich as Miss Rivers. Flora told her it was wrong to be
      discontented, but the answer was, 'I don't want it for myself, I want to have pretty things to
      give away.'</p>
     <p>And her mind could not be turned from the thought by any attempt of her sister. Even when
      they met Dr. May coming out of the hospital, Blanche renewed the subject. She poured out the
      catalogue of Miss Rivers's purchases, making appealing attempts at looking under his
      spectacles into his eyes, and he perfectly understood the tenor of her song.</p>
     <p>'I have had a sight, too, of little maidens preparing Easter gifts,' said he.</p>
     <p>'Have you, papa? What were they? Were they as nice as Miss Rivers's?'</p>
     <p>'I don't know, but I thought they were the best sort of gifts, for I saw that plenty of kind
      thought and clever contrivance went to them, aye, and some little selfdenial too.'</p>
     <p>'Papa, you look as if you meant <hi>something;</hi> but ours are nothing but nasty old
      rubbish.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps some fairy, or something better, has brought a wand to touch the rubbish, Blanche;
      for I think that the maidens gave what would have been worthless kept, but became precious as
      they gave it.'</p>
     <pb n="198"/>
     <p>'Do you mean the list of our flannel petticoats, papa, that Mary has made into a
      tippet?'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps I meant Mary's own time and pains, as well as the tippet. Would she have done much
      good with them otherwise?'</p>
     <p>'No, she would have played. Oh! then, you like the presents because they are our own making?
      I never thought of that. Was that the reason you did not give us any of your sovereigns to buy
      things with?'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps I want my sovereigns for the eleven gaping mouths at home, Blanche. But would not
      it be a pity to spoil your pleasure? You would have lost all the chattering and laughing and
      buzzing I have heard round Margaret of late, and I am quite sure Miss Rivers can hardly be as
      happy in the gifts that cost her nothing, as one little girl who gives her sugar-plums out of
      her own mouth!'</p>
     <p>Blanche clasped her papa's hand tight, and bounded five or six times. 'They are our
      presents, not yours,' said she. 'Yes, I see. I like them better now.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, aye,' said the Doctor. 'Seeing Miss Rivers's must not take the shine out of yours, my
      little maids; for if you can't give much, you have the pleasure of giving the best of all,
      your labour of love.' Then thinking on, and speaking to Flora, 'The longer I live, the more I
      see the blessing of being born in a state of life where you can't both eat your cake and give
      it away.'</p>
     <p>Flora never was at ease in a conversation with her father; she could not follow him, and did
      not like to show it. She answered aside from the mark, 'You would not have Blanche underrate
      Miss Rivers?'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed, she is as good and sweet a creature as ever came across me—most kind to
      Margaret, and loving to all the world. I like to see one whom care and grief have never set
      their grip upon. Most likely she would do like Ethel, if she had the opportunity, but she has
      not.'</p>
     <p>'So she has not the same merit?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'We don't talk of merit. I meant that the power of sacrifice is a great advantage. The habit
      of small sacrifice that is made necessary in a large family is a discipline that only-children
      are without; and so, with regard to wealth, I think people are to be pitied who can give
      extensively out of such abundance that they can hardly feel the want.'</p>
     <p>'In effect, they can do much more,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I am not sure of that. They <hi>can</hi> , of course, but it must be at the cost of
      personal labour and sacrifice. I have often thought of the words, "Silver and gold have I
      none, but such as I have give I thee." And <hi>such as we have</hi> it is that does the good;
      the gold,
      <pb n="199"/> if we have it, but, at any rate, the personal influence; the very proof of
      sincerity, shown by the exertion and selfdenial, tells far more than money lightly come by,
      lightly spent.'</p>
     <p>'Do you mean that a person who maintained a whole school would do less good than one who
      taught one child?'</p>
     <p>'If the rich person take no pains, and leave the school to take care of itself—nay, if he
      only visit it now and then, and never let it inconvenience him, has he the least security that
      the scholars are obtaining any real good from it? If the teacher of the one child is doing his
      utmost, he is working for himself at least.'</p>
     <p>'Suppose we could build, say our Church and school, on Cocksmoor at once, and give our
      superintendence besides?'</p>
     <p>'If things were ripe for it, the means would come. As it is, it is a fine field for Ethel
      and Richard. I believe it will be the making of them both. I am sure it is training Ethel, or
      making her train herself, as we could never have done without it. But here, come in and see
      old Mrs. Robins. A visit from you will cheer her up.'</p>
     <p>Flora was glad of the interruption, the conversation was uncomfortable to her. She almost
      fancied her papa was moralizing for their good, but that he carried it too far, for wealthy
      people assuredly had it in their power to do great things, and might work as hard themselves;
      besides, it was finer in them, there was so much <hi>éclat</hi> in their stooping to charity.
      But her knowledge of his character would not allow her to think for a moment that he could say
      aught but from the bottom of his heart—no, it was one of his one-sided views that led him into
      paradox. 'It was just like papa,' and so there was no need to attend to it. It was one of his
      enthusiasms, he was so very fond of Ethel, probably because of her likeness to himself. Flora
      thought Ethel put almost too forward—they all helped at Cocksmoor, and Ethel was very queer
      and unformed, and could do nothing by herself. The only thing Flora did keep in her mind was,
      that her papa had spoken to her, as if she were a woman compared with Ethel.</p>
     <p>Little Blanche made her report of the conversation to Mary, 'that it was so nice; and now
      she did not care about Miss Rivers's fine presents at all, for papa said what one made one's
      self was better to give than what one bought. And papa said, too, that it was a good thing not
      to be rich, for then one never felt the miss of what one gave away.'</p>
     <p>Margaret, who overheard the exposition, thought it so much to Blanche's credit, that she
      could not help repeating it in the evening, after the little girl was gone to bed, when Mr.
      Wilmot had come in to arrange's the programme for Cocksmoor. So the little fit of
      <pb n="200"/> discontent and its occasion, the meeting with Meta Rivers, were discussed.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Mr. Wilmot, 'those Riverses are open-handed. They really seem to have so much
      money, that they don't know what to do with it. My brother is ready to complain that they
      spoil his parish. It is all meant so well, and they are so kind-hearted and excellent, that it
      is a shame to find fault, and I tell Charles and his wife that their grumbling at such a
      squire proves them the most spoilt of all.'</p>
     <p>'Indiscriminate liberality?' asked the Doctor. 'I should guess the old gentleman to be
      rather soft!'</p>
     <p>'That's one thing. The parish is so small, and there are so few to shower all this bounty
      on, and they are so utterly unused to country people. They seem to think by laying out money
      they can get a show set of peasants in rustic cottages, just as they have their fancy cows and
      poultry—all that offends the eye out of the way.'</p>
     <p>'Making it a matter of taste,' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'I'm sure I would,' said Norman aside to Ethel. 'What's the use of getting one's self
      disgusted?'</p>
     <p>'One must not begin with showing dislike,' began Ethel, 'or—'</p>
     <p>'Aye—you like rags, don't you? but hush.'</p>
     <p>'That is just what I should expect of Mr. Rivers,' said Dr. May; 'he has cultivated his
      taste till it is getting to be a disease, but his daughter has no lack of wit.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps not. Charles and Mary are very fond of her, but she is entirely inexperienced, and
      that is a serious thing with so much money to throw about. She pays people for sending their
      children to school, and keeping their houses tidy; and there is so much given away, that it is
      enough to take away all independence and motive for exertion. The people speculate on it, and
      take it as a right; by-and-by there will be a re-action—she will find out she is imposed upon,
      take offence, and for the rest of her life will go about saying how ungrateful the poor
      are!'</p>
     <p>'It is a pity good people won't have a little common sense,' said Dr. May. 'But there's
      something so bewitching in that little girl, that I can't give her up. I verily believe she
      will right herself.'</p>
     <p>'I have scarcely seen her,' said Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>'She has won papa's heart by her kindness to me,' said Margaret, smiling. 'You see her
      beautiful flowers? She seems to me, made to lavish pleasures on others wherever she goes.'</p>
     <p>'O yes, they are most kind-hearted,' said Mr. Wilmot. 'It is only the excess of a virtue
      that could be blamed in them, and they
      <pb n="201"/> are most valuable to the place. She will learn experience in time— I only hope
      she will not be spoilt.'</p>
     <p>Flora felt as if her father must be thinking his morning's argument confirmed, and she was
      annoyed. But she thought there was no reason why wealth should not be used sensibly, and if
      she were at the head of such an establishment as the Grange, her charity should be so well
      regulated as to be the subject of general approbation.</p>
     <p>She wanted to find someone else on her side, and, as they went to bed, she said to Ethel,
      'Don't you wish we had some of this superfluity of the Riverses for poor Cocksmoor?'</p>
     <p>'I wish we had <hi>anything</hi> for Cocksmoor! Here's a great hole in my boot, and nurse
      says I must get a new pair, that is seven-and-sixpence gone! I shall never get the first pound
      made up towards building!'</p>
     <p>'And pounds seem nothing to them,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Yes, but if they don't manage right with them—I'll tell you, Flora, I got into a fit of
      wishing the other day; it does seem such a grievous pity to see those children running to
      waste for want of daily teaching, and Jenny Hall had forgotten everything. I was vexed, and
      thought it was all no use while we could not do more; but just then I began to look out the
      texts Ritchie had marked for me to print for them to learn, and the first was, "Be thou
      faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things," and then I thought
      perhaps we were learning to be faithful with a few things. I am sure what they said to-night
      showed it was lucky we have not more in our hands. I should do wrong for ever with the little
      we have if it were not for Ritchie and Margaret. By the time we have really got the money
      together for the school, perhaps I shall have more sense.'</p>
     <p>'Got the money! As if we ever could!'</p>
     <p>'Oh, yes! we shall and will. It need not be more than £70, Ritchie says, and I have twelve
      shillings for certain, put out from the money for hire of the room, and the books and clothes,
      and, in spite of these horrid boots, I shall save something out of this quarter, half-a-crown
      at least. And I have another plan besides—'</p>
     <p>But Flora had to go down to Margaret's room to bed. Flora was always ready to throw herself
      into the present, and liked to be the most useful person in all that went forward, so that no
      thoughts of greatness interfered with her enjoyment at Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>The house seemed wild that Easter Monday morning. Ethel, Mary, and Blanche, flew about in
      all directions, and in spite of much undoing of their own arrangements, finished their
      preparations so much too early, that at half-past eleven, Mary complained that she had nothing
      to do, and that dinner would never come.</p>
     <pb n="202"/>
     <p>Many were the lamentations at leaving Margaret behind, but she answered them by talking of
      the treat of having papa all to herself, for he had lent them the gig, and promised to stay at
      home all the afternoon with her.</p>
     <p>The first division started on foot directly after dinner, the real council of education, as
      Norman called them, namely, Mr. Wilmot, Richard, Ethel, and Mary; Flora, the other member,
      waited to take care of Blanche and Aubrey, who were to come in the gig, with the cakes,
      tea-kettles, and prizes, driven by Norman. Tom and Hector Ernescliffe were invited to join the
      party, and many times did Mary wish for Harry.</p>
     <p>Supremely happy were the young people as they reached the common, and heard the shout of
      tumultuous joy, raised by their pupils, who were on the watch for them. All was now activity.
      Everybody trooped into Mrs. Green's house, while Richard and Ethel ran different ways to
      secure that the fires were burning, which they had hired, to boil their kettles, with the tea
      in them.</p>
     <p>Then when the kitchen was so full that it seemed as if it could hold no more, some kind of
      order was produced, the children were seated on their benches, and, while the mothers stood
      behind to listen, Mr. Wilmot began to examine, as well as he could in so crowded an
      audience.</p>
     <p>There <hi>was</hi> progress. Yes, there was. Only three were as utterly rude and idealess as
      they used to be at Christmas. Glimmerings had dawned on most, and one—Una M'Carthy—was fit to
      come forward to claim Mr. Wilmot's promise of a Prayer-book. She could really read and say the
      Catechism, her Irish wit and love of learning had out-stripped all the rest, and she was the
      pride of Ethel's heart, fit, now, to present herself on equal terms with the Stoneborough set,
      as far as her sense was concerned—though, alas! neither present nor exhortation had succeeded
      in making her anything, in looks, but a picturesque tatterdemalion, her sandy elf locks
      streaming over a pair of eyes, so dancing and <hi>gracieuses</hi> , that it was impossible to
      scold her.</p>
     <p>With beating heart, as if her own success in life depended for ever on the way her flock
      acquitted themselves, Ethel stood by Mr. Wilmot, trying to read answers coming out of the dull
      mouths of her children, and looking exultingly at Richard whenever some good reply was made,
      especially when Una answered an unexpected question. It was too delightful to hear how well
      she remembered all the history up to the flood, and how prettily it came out in her Irish
      accent! That made up for all the atrocious stupidity of others, who, after being told every
      time since they had begun, who gave their names, now chose to forget.</p>
     <pb n="203"/>
     <p>In the midst, while the assembly were listening with admiration to the reading of the
      scholar next in proficiency to Una, a boy, who could read words of five letters without
      spelling, there was a fresh squeezing at the door, and, the crowd opening as well as it could,
      in came Flora and Blanche, while Norman's head was seen for a moment in the doorway.</p>
     <p>Flora's whisper to Ethel was her first discovery, that the closeness and heat of the room
      were nearly overpowering. Her excitement had made all be forgotten. 'Could not a window be
      opened?'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Green interfered—it had been nailed up because her husband had the rheumatiz!</p>
     <p>'Where's Aubrey?' asked Mary.</p>
     <p>'With Norman. Norman said he would not let him go into the black-hole, so he has got him out
      of doors. Ethel! we must come out! You don't know what an atmosphere it is! Blanche, go out to
      Norman!'</p>
     <p>'Flora, Flora! you don't consider,' said Ethel, in an agony.</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes. It is not at all cold. Let them have their presents out of doors, and eat their
      buns.'</p>
     <p>Richard and Mr. Wilmot agreed with Flora, and the party were turned out. Ethel did own, when
      she was in the open air, 'that it had been rather hot.'</p>
     <p>Norman's face was a sight, as he stood holding Aubrey in his arms, to gratify the child's
      impatience. The stiffing den, the uncouth aspect of the children, the head girl so very ragged
      a specimen, thoroughly revolted his somewhat fastidious disposition. This was Ethel's delight!
      to this she made so many sacrifices! this was all that her time and labour had effected! He
      did not wish to vex her, but it was more than he could stand.</p>
     <p>However, Ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy. It was a fine spring day, and on
      the open space of the common the arrangements were quickly made. The children stood in a long
      line, and the baskets were unpacked. Flora and Ethel called the names, Mary and Blanche gave
      the presents, and assuredly the grins, courtesies, and pulls of the forelock they elicited,
      could not have been more hearty for any of Miss Rivers's treasures. The buns and the kettles
      of tea followed—it was perfect delight to entertainers and entertained, except when Mary's
      dignity was cruelly hurt by Norman's authoritatively taking a kettle out of her hands, telling
      her she would be the death of herself or somebody else, and reducing her to the mere rank of a
      bun distributor, which Blanche and Aubrey could do just as well; while he stalked along with a
      grave and resigned countenance, filling up the cups held out to him by timid-looking children.
      Mary next fell in with Granny Hall, who had gone into
      <pb n="204"/> such an ecstasy over Blanche and Aubrey, that Blanche did not know which way to
      look; and Aubrey, in some fear that the old woman might intend to kiss him, returned the
      compliments by telling her she was 'ugly up in her face,' at which she laughed heartily, and
      uttered more vehement benedictions.</p>
     <p>Finally, the three best children, boys and girls, were to be made fit to be seen, and
      recommended by Mr. Wilmot to the Sunday-school and penny-club at Stoneborough, and, this being
      proclaimed, and the children selected, the assembly dispersed. Mr. Wilmot rejoicing Ethel and
      Richard, by saying, 'Well, really, you have made a beginning. There is an improvement in tone
      among those children, that is more satisfactory than any progress they may have made.'</p>
     <p>Ethel's eyes beamed, and she hurried to tell Flora. Richard coloured and gave his quiet
      smile, then turned to put things in order for their return.</p>
     <p>'Will you drive home, Richard?' said Norman, coming up to him.</p>
     <p>'Don't you wish it?' said Richard, who had many minor arrangements to make, and would have
      preferred walking home independently.</p>
     <p>'No, thank you, I have a head-ache, and walking may take it off,' said Norman, taking off
      his hat and passing his fingers through his hair.</p>
     <p>'A head-ache again—I am sorry to hear it.'</p>
     <p>'It is only that suffocating den of yours. My head ached from the moment I looked into it.
      How can you take Ethel into such a hole, Richard? It is enough to kill her to go on with it
      for ever.'</p>
     <p>'It is not so every day,' said the elder brother quietly. 'It is a warm day, and there was
      an unusual crowd.'</p>
     <p>'I shall speak to my father,' exclaimed Norman, with somewhat of the supercilious tone that
      he had now and then been tempted to address to his brother. 'It is not fit that Ethel should
      give up everything, health and all, to such a set as these. They look as if they had been
      picked out of the gutter—dirt, squalor, everything disgusting, and summer coming on, too, and
      that horrid place with no window to open! It is utterly unbearable!'</p>
     <p>Richard stooped to pick up a heavy basket, then smiled and said, 'You must get over such
      things as these if you mean to be a clergyman, Norman.'</p>
     <p>'Whatever I am to be, it does not concern the girls being in such a place as this. I am
      surprised that you could suffer it.'</p>
     <p>There was no answer—Richard was walking off with his basket, and putting it into the
      carriage. Norman was not pleased with himself, but thought it his duty to let his father know
      his opinion of Ethel's weekly resort. All he wished was to avoid Ethel herself,
      <pb n="205"/> not liking to show her his sentiments, and he was glad to see her put into the
      gig with Aubrey and Mary.</p>
     <p>They rushed into the drawing-room, full of glee, when they came home, all shouting their
      news together, and had not at first leisure to perceive that Margaret had some tidings for
      them in return. Mr. Rivers had been there, with a pressing invitation to his daughter's
      school-feast, and it had been arranged that Flora and Ethel should go and spend the day at the
      Grange, and their father come to dine, and fetch them home in the evening. Margaret had been
      much pleased with the manner in which the thing was done. When Dr. May, who seemed reluctant
      to accept the proposal that related to himself, was called out of the room, Mr. Rivers had, in
      a most kind manner, begged her to say whether she thought it would be painful to him, or
      whether it might do his spirits good. She decidedly gave her opinion in favour of the
      invitation, Mr. Rivers gained his point, and she had ever since been persuading her father to
      like the notion, and assuring him it need not be made a precedent for the renewal of
      invitations to dine out in the town. He thought the change would be pleasant for his girls,
      and had, therefore, consented.</p>
     <p>'O, papa, papa! thank you!' cried Ethel, enraptured, as soon as he came into the room. 'How
      very kind of you! How I have wished to see the Grange, and all Norman talks about! Oh dear! I
      am so glad you are going there too!'</p>
     <p>'Why, what should you do with me?' said Dr. May, who felt and looked depressed at this
      taking up of the world again.</p>
     <p>'Oh dear! I should not like it at all without you! It would be no fun at all by ourselves. I
      wish Flora would come home. How pleased she will be! Papa! I do wish you would look as if you
      didn't mind it. I can't enjoy it if you don't like going.'</p>
     <p>'I shall when I am there, my dear,' said the Doctor, affectionately, putting his arm around
      her as she stood by him. 'It will be a fine day's sport for you.'</p>
     <p>'But can't you like it beforehand, papa?'</p>
     <p>'Not just this minute, Ethel,' said he, with his bright sad smile. 'All I like just now, is
      my girl's not being able to do without me; but we'll do the best we can—So your flock
      acquitted themselves brilliantly? Who is your Senior Wrangler?'</p>
     <p>Ethel threw herself eagerly into the history of the examination, and had almost forgotten
      the invitation till she heard the front door open. Then it was not she, but Margaret, who told
      Flora—Ethel could not, as she said, enjoy what seemed to sadden her father. Flora received it
      much more calmly. 'It will be very pleasant,' said she; 'it was very kind of papa to consent.
      You will have Richard and Norman, Margaret, to be with you in the evening.'</p>
     <pb n="206"/>
     <p>And, as soon as they went up-stairs, Ethel began to write down the list of prizes in her
      school journal, while Flora took out the best evening frocks, to study whether the crape
      looked fresh enough.</p>
     <p>The invitation was a convenient subject of conversation, for Norman had so much to tell his
      sisters of the curiosities they must look for at the Grange, that he was not obliged to
      mention Cocksmoor. He did not like to mortify Ethel by telling her his intense disgust, and he
      knew he was about to do what she would think a great injury by speaking to his father on the
      subject; but he thought it for her real welfare, and took the first opportunity of making to
      his father and Margaret a most formidable description of Ethel's black-hole. It quite alarmed
      Margaret, but the Doctor smiled, saying, 'Aye, aye, I know the face Norman puts on if he looks
      into a cottage.'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Norman, with some mortification, 'all I know is, that my head ached all the
      rest of the day.'</p>
     <p>'Very likely, but your head is not Ethel's, and there were twice as many people as the place
      was intended to hold.'</p>
     <p>'A stuffy hole, full of peat-smoke, and with a window that can't open at the best of
      times.'</p>
     <p>'Peat-smoke is wholesome,' said Dr. May, looking provoking.</p>
     <p>'You don't know what it is, papa, or you would never let Ethel spend her life there. It is
      poisonous!'</p>
     <p>'I'll take care of Ethel,' said Dr. May, walking off, and leaving Norman in a state of
      considerable annoyance at being thus treated. He broke out into fresh exclamations against the
      horrors of Cocksmoor, telling Margaret she had no idea what a den it was.</p>
     <p>'But, Norman, it can't be so very bad, or Richard would not allow it.'</p>
     <p>'Richard is deluded!' said Norman; 'but if he chooses to run after dirty brats, why should
      he take Ethel there?'</p>
     <p>'My dear Norman, you know it is all Ethel's doing.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I know she has gone crazy after them, and given up all her Greek for it. It is past
      endurance!' said Norman, who had worked himself up into great indignation.</p>
     <p>'Well, but surely, Norman, it is better they should do what they can for those poor
      creatures, than for Ethel to learn Greek.'</p>
     <p>'I don't know that. Let those who are fit for nothing else go and drone over A,B,C, with
      ragged children, if they like. It is just their vocation; but there is an order in everything,
      Margaret, and minds of a superior kind are intended for higher purposes, not to be wasted in
      this manner.'</p>
     <p>'I don't know whether they are wasted!' said Margaret, not
      <pb n="207"/> quite liking Norman's tone, though she had not much to say to his
      arguments.'</p>
     <p>'Not wasted? Not in doing what anyone can do? I know what you'll say about the poor. I grant
      it, but high ability must be given for a purpose, not to be thrown away. It is common sense,
      that some one must be meant to do the dirty work.'</p>
     <p>'I see what you mean, Norman, but I don't quite like that to be called by such a name. I
      think—' she hesitated. 'Don't you think you dislike such things more than—'</p>
     <p>'Anyone must abominate dirt and slovenliness. I know what you mean. My father thinks 'tis
      all nonsense in me, but his profession has made him insensible to such things, and he fancies
      everyone else is the same! Now, Margaret, and I unreasonable?'</p>
     <p>'I am sure I don't know,' dear Norman,' said Margaret, hesitating, and feeling it her duty
      to say something, 'I dare say it was very disagreeable.'</p>
     <p>'And you think, too, that I made a disturbance for nothing?'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed I don't nor does dear papa. I have no doubt he will see whether it is proper for
      Ethel. All I think he meant is, that perhaps your not being well last winter, has made you a
      little more sensitive in such things.'</p>
     <p>Norman paused, and coloured. He remembered the pain it had given him to find himself
      incapable of being of use to his father, and that he had resolved to conquer the weakness of
      nerve of which he was ashamed; but he did not like to connect this with his fastidious
      feelings of refinement. He would not own to himself that they were over nice, and, at the
      bottom of all this justification, rankled Richard's saying, that he who cared for such things
      was unfit for a clergyman. Norman's secret thought was, it was all very well for those who
      could only aspire to parish work in wretched cottages—people who could distinguish themselves
      were more useful at the University, forming minds, and opening new discoveries in
      learning.</p>
     <p>Was Norman quite proof against the consciousness of daily excelling all his competitors? His
      superiority had become even more manifest this Easter, when Cheviot and Forder, the two elder
      boys whom he had outstripped, left the school, avowedly, because it was not worth while for
      them to stay, since they had so little chance of the Randall scholarship. Norman had now only
      to walk over the course, no one even approaching him but Harvey Anderson.</p>
     <p>Meta Rivers always said that fine weather came at her call, and so it did—glowing sunshine
      streaming over the shaven turf, and penetrating even the solid masses of the great cedar.</p>
     <p>The carriage was sent for the Miss Mays, and, at two o'clock, they
      <pb n="208"/> arrived. Flora, extremely anxious that Ethel should comport herself discreetly;
      and Ethel full of curiosity and eagerness, the only drawback, her fears that her papa was
      doing what he disliked. She was not in the least shy, and did not think about her manner
      enough to be troubled by the consciousness that it had a good deal of abruptness and
      eagerness, and that her short sight made her awkward. Meta met them with out-stretched hands,
      and a face beaming with welcome. 'I told you I should get my way!' she said, triumphantly,
      and, after her warm greeting, she looked with some respect at the face of the Miss May, who
      was so very clever. It certainly was not what she expected, not at all like either of the four
      sisters she had already seen—brown, sallow, and with that sharp long nose, and the eager eyes,
      and brow a little knit by the desire to see as far as she could. It was pleasanter to look at
      Flora.</p>
     <p>Ethel left the talk chiefly to Flora—there was wonder and study enough for her in the
      grounds and garden, and when Mrs. Larpent tried to enter into conversation with her, she let
      it drop two or three times, while she was peering hard at a picture, and trying to make out
      its subject. However, when they all went out to walk to Church, Ethel lighted up, and talked,
      admired, and asked questions in her quick, eager way, which interested Mrs. Larpent greatly.
      The governess asked after Norman, and no more was wanted to produce a volume of histories of
      his successes, till Flora turned as she walked before with Meta, saying, 'Why, Ethel, you are
      quite overwhelming Mrs. Larpent.'</p>
     <p>But some civil answer convinced Ethel that what she said was interesting, and she would not
      be stopped in her account of their anxieties on the day of the examination. Flora was pleased
      that Meta, catching some words, begged to hear more, and Flora gave an account of the matter,
      soberer in terms, but quietly setting Norman at a much greater distance from all his
      competitors.</p>
     <p>After Church came the feast in the school. It was a large commodious building. Meta declared
      it was very tiresome that it was so good inside, it was so ugly, she should never rest till
      papa had built her a real beauty. They found Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot in the school, with a
      very nice well-dressed set of boys and girls, and—but there is no need to describe the
      roast-beef and plum-pudding, 'the feast ate merrily,' and Ethel was brilliantly happy waiting
      on the children, and so was sunny-hearted Meta. Flora was too busy in determining what the
      Riverses might be thinking of her and her sister to give herself up to the enjoyment.</p>
     <p>Ethel found a small boy looking ready to cry at an untouched slice of beef. She examined him
      whether he could cut it, and at
      <pb n="209"/> last discovered that, as had been the case with one or two of her own brothers
      at the same age, meat was repugnant to him. In her vehement manner, she flew off to fetch him
      some pudding, and hurrying up, as she thought, to Mr. Charles Wilmot, who had been giving it
      out, she thrust her plate between him and the dish, and had begun her explanation, when she
      perceived it was a stranger, and she stood, utterly discomfited, not saying, 'I beg your
      pardon,' but only blushing, awkward and confused, as he spoke to her, in a good-natured,
      hospitable manner, which showed her it must be Mr. Rivers. She obtained her pudding, and,
      turning hastily, retreated.</p>
     <p>'Meta,' said Mr. Rivers, as his daughter came out of the school with him, for, open and airy
      as it was, the numbers and the dinner made him regard it as Norman had viewed the Cocksmoor
      room, 'was that one of the Miss Mays?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa, Ethel, the third, the clever one.'</p>
     <p>'I thought she must be one of them from her dress; but what a difference between her and the
      others!'</p>
     <p>Mr. Rivers was a great admirer of beauty, and Meta, brought up to be the same, was
      disappointed, but consoled herself by admiring Flora. Ethel, after the awkwardness was over,
      thought no more of the matter, but went on in full enjoyment of the feast. The eating
      finished, the making of presents commenced, and choice ones they were. The smiles of Meta and
      of the children were a pretty sight, and Ethel thought she had never seen anything so like a
      beneficent fairy. Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot said their words of counsel and encouragement, and, by
      five o'clock, all was over.</p>
     <p>'Oh! I am sorry!' said Meta, 'Easter won't come again for a whole year, and it has been so
      delightful. How that dear little Annie smiled and nursed her doll! I wish I could see her show
      it to her mother! Oh! how nice it is! I am so glad papa brought me to live in the country. I
      don't think anything can be so charming in all the world as seeing little children happy!'</p>
     <p>Ethel could not think how the Wilmots could have found it in their heart to regret the
      liberality of this sweet damsel, on whom she began to look with Norman's enthusiastic
      admiration.</p>
     <p>There was time for a walk round the grounds, Meta doing the honours to Flora, and Ethel
      walking with Mrs. Larpent. Both pairs were very good friends, and the two sisters admired and
      were charmed with the beauty of the gardens and conservatories—Ethel laying up a rich store of
      intelligence for Margaret; but still she was not entirely happy; her papa was more and more on
      her mind. He had looked dispirited at breakfast; he had a long hard day's work before him; and
      she was increasingly uneasy at the thought that it would be a painful effort to him to join
      them in the evening. Her
      <pb n="210"/> mind was full of it when she was conducted, with Flora, to the room where they
      were to dress; and when Flora began to express her delight, her answer was only that she hoped
      it was not very unpleasant to papa.</p>
     <p>'It is not worth while to be unhappy about that, Ethel. If it is an effort, it will be good
      for him when he is once here. I know he will enjoy it.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I should think he would—I hope he will. He must like you to have such a friend as Miss
      Rivers. How pretty she is!'</p>
     <p>'Now, Ethel, it is high time to dress. Pray make yourself look nice—don't twist up your hair
      in that any-how fashion.'</p>
     <p>Ethel sighed, then began talking fast about some hints on school-keeping which she had
      picked up for Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>Flora's glossy braids were in full order, while Ethel was still struggling to get her plait
      smooth, and was extremely beholden to her sister for taking it into her own hands, and doing
      the best with it that its thinness and roughness permitted. And then Flora pinched and pulled
      and arranged Ethel's frock, in vain attempts to make it sit like her own—those sharp high
      bones resisted all attempts to disguise them. 'Never mind, Flora, it is quite tidy, I am sure,
      there—do let me be in peace. You are like old nurse.'</p>
     <p>'So those are all the thanks I get?'</p>
     <p>'Well, thank you very much, dear Flora. You are a famous person. How I wish Margaret could
      see that lovely mimosa!'</p>
     <p>'And, Ethel, do take care. Pray don't poke and spy when you come into the room, and don't
      frown when you are trying to see. I hope you won't have anything to help at dinner. Take care
      how you manage.'</p>
     <p>'I'll try,' said Ethel, meekly, though a good deal tormented, as Flora went on with
      half-a-dozen more injunctions, closed by Meta's coming to fetch them. Little Meta did not like
      to show them her own bed-room—she pitied them so much when she thought of the contrast. She
      would have liked to put Flora's arm through her's, but she thought it would look neglectful of
      Ethel; so she only showed the way down stairs. Ethel forgot all her sister's orders; for there
      stood her father, and she looked most earnestly at his face. It was cheerful, and his voice
      sounded well-pleased as he greeted Meta; then resumed an animated talk with Mr. Rivers. Ethel
      drew as near him as she could; she had a sense of protection, and could open to full enjoyment
      when she saw him bright. At the first pause in the conversation, the gentlemen turned to the
      young ladies. Mr. Rivers began talking to Flora, and Dr. May, after a few pleasant words to
      Meta, went back to Ethel. He wanted her to see his favourite pictures—he led her up to them,
      made her put on his
      <pb n="211"/> spectacles to see them better, and showed her their special merits. Mr. Rivers
      and the others joined them; Ethel said little, except a remark or two in answer to her papa,
      but she was very happy—she felt that he liked to have her with him; and Meta, too, was struck
      by the soundness of her few sayings, and the participation there seemed to be in all things
      between the father and daughter.</p>
     <p>At dinner Ethel went on pretty well. She was next to her father, and was very glad to find
      the dinner so grand, that no side-dish fell to her lot to be carved. There was a great deal of
      pleasant talk, such as the girls could understand, though they did not join much in it, except
      that now and then Dr. May turned to Ethel as a reference for names and dates. To make up for
      silence at dinner, there was a most confidential chatter in the drawing-room. Flora and Meta
      on one side, hand in hand, calling each other by their Christian names, Mrs. Larpent and Ethel
      on the other. Flora dreaded only that Ethel was talking too much, and revealing too much in
      how different style they lived. Then came the gentlemen, Dr. May begging Mr. Rivers to show
      Ethel one of his prints, when Ethel stooped more than ever, as if her eyelashes were feelers,
      but she was in transports of delight, and her embarrassment entirely at an end in her
      admiration, as she exclaimed and discussed with her papa, and by her hearty appreciation made
      Mr. Rivers for the time forget her plainness. Music followed; Flora played nicely, Meta like a
      well-taught girl, Ethel went on musing over the engravings. The carriage was announced, and so
      ended the day in Norman's fairy land. Ethel went home, leaning hard against her papa, talking
      to him of Raffaelle's Madonnas; and looking out at the stars, and thinking how the heavenly
      beauty of those faces that, in the prints she had been turning over, seemed to be connected
      with the glories of the dark-blue sky and glowing stars. 'As one star differeth from another
      star in glory,' murmured she; 'that was the lesson to-day, papa;' and when she felt him press
      her hand, she knew he was thinking of that last time she had heard the lesson, when he had not
      been with her, and her thoughts went with his, though not another word was spoken.</p>
     <p>Flora hardly knew when they ceased to talk. She had musings equally engrossing of her own.
      She saw she was likely to be very intimate with Meta Rivers, and she was roaming away into
      schemes for not letting the intercourse drop, and hopes of being admitted to many a pleasure,
      as yet little within her reach—parties, balls, London itself, and, above all, the satisfaction
      of being admired. The certainty that Mr. Rivers thought her pretty and agreeable, had
      gratified her all the evening, and if he, with his refined taste, thought so, what would
      others think? Her only fear was, that Ethel's
      <pb n="212"/> awkwardness might make an unfavourable impression, but, at least, she said to
      herself, it was anything but vulgar awkwardness.</p>
     <p>Their reflections were interrupted by the fly stopping. It was at a little shop in the
      outskirts of the town, and Dr. May explained that he wanted to inquire for a patient. He went
      in for a moment, then came back to desire that they would go home, for he should be detained
      some little time. No one need sit up for him—he would let himself in.</p>
     <p>It seemed a comment on Ethel's thoughts, bringing them back to the present hour. That daily
      work of homely mercy, hoping for nothing again, was surely the true way of doing service.</p>

     <p>Dr. May promised Margaret that he would see whether the black hole of Cocksmoor was
      all that Norman depicted it, and, accordingly, he came home that way on Tuesday evening, the
      next week, much to the astonishment of Richard, who was in the act of so mending the window
      that it might let in air when open, and keep it out when shut, neither of which purposes had
      it ever yet answered.</p>
     <p>Dr. May walked in, met his daughter's look of delight and surprise, spoke cheerfully to Mrs.
      Green, a hospital acquaintance of his, like half the rest of the country, and made her smile
      and courtesy by asking if she was not surprised at such doings in her house; then looked at
      the children, and patted the head that looked most fit to pat, inquired who was the best
      scholar, and offered a penny to whoever could spell copper tea-kettle, which being done by
      three merry mortals, and having made him extremely popular, he offered Ethel a lift, and
      carried her off between him and Adams, on whom he now depended for driving him, since Richard
      was going to Oxford at once.</p>
     <p>It was possible to spare him now. Dr. May's arm was as well as he expected it ever would be;
      he had discarded the sling, and could use his hand again, but the arm was still stiff and
      weak—he could not stretch it out, nor use it for anything requiring strength; it
      <pb n="213"/> soon grew tired with writing, and his daughters feared that it ached more than
      he chose to confess, when they saw it resting in the breast of his waistcoat. Driving he never
      would have attempted again, even if he could, and he had quite given up carving—he could
      better bear to sit at the side, than at the bottom of the dinner-table.</p>
     <p>Means of carrying Margaret safely had been arranged by Richard, and there was no necessity
      for longer delaying his going to Oxford, but he was so unwillingly spared by all, as to put
      him quite into good spirits. Ethel was much concerned to lose him from Cocksmoor, and dreaded
      hindrances to her going thither without his escort; but she had much trust in having her
      father on her side, and meant to get authority from him for the propriety of going alone with
      Mary.</p>
     <p>She did not know how Norman had jeopardized her projects, but the danger blew over. Dr. May
      told Margaret that the place was clean and wholesome, and though more smoky than might be
      preferred, there was nothing to do anyone in health any harm, especially when the walk there
      and back was over the fresh moor. He lectured Ethel herself on opening the window, now that
      she could; and advised Norman to go and spend an hour in the school, that he might learn how
      pleasant peat-smoke was—a speech Norman did not like at all. The real touchstone of temper is
      ridicule on a point where we do not choose to own ourselves fastidious, and if it had been
      from anyone but his father, Norman would not have so entirely kept down his irritation.</p>
     <p>Richard passed his examination successfully, and Dr. May wrote himself to express his
      satisfaction. Nothing went wrong just now except little Tom, who seemed to be justifying
      Richard's fears of the consequence of exciting his father's anger. At home, he shrank and
      hesitated at the simplest question if put by his father suddenly; and the appearance of
      cowardice and prevarication displeasing Dr. May further, rendered his tone louder, and
      frightened Tom the more, giving his manner an air of sullen reserve that was most unpleasant.
      At school, it was much the same—he kept aloof from Norman, and threw himself more into the
      opposite faction, by whom he was shielded from all punishment, except what they chose
      themselves to inflict on him.</p>
     <p>Norman's post as head of the school was rendered more difficult by the departure of his
      friend Cheviot, who had always upheld his authority; Harvey Anderson did not openly
      transgress, for he had a character to maintain, but it was well known throughout the school
      that there was a wide difference between the boys, and that Anderson
      <pb n="214"/> thought it absurd, superfluous, and troublesome in May not to wink at abuses
      which appeared to be licensed by long standing. When Edward Anderson, Axworthy, and their set,
      broke through rules, it was with the understanding that the second boy in the school would
      support them, if he durst.</p>
     <p>The summer, and the cricket season, brought the battle of Ballhatchet's house to issue. The
      cricket ground was the field close to it, and for the last two or three years there had been a
      frequent custom of despatching juniors to his house for tarts and ginger-beer bottles. Norman
      knew of instances last year in which this had led to serious mischief, and had made up his
      mind that, at whatever loss of popularity, it was his duty to put a stop to the practice.</p>
     <p>He was an ardent cricketer himself, and though the game did not, in anticipation, seem to
      him to have all the charms of last year, he entered into it with full zest when once engaged.
      But his eye was on all parts of the field, and especially on the corner by the bridge, and the
      boys knew him well enough to attempt nothing unlawful within the range of that glance.
      However, the constant vigilance was a strain too great to be always kept up, and he had reason
      to believe he was eluded more than once.</p>
     <p>At last came a capture, something like that of Tom, one which he could not have well avoided
      making. The victim was George Larkins, the son of a clergyman in the neighbourhood, a wild,
      merry varlet, who got into mischief rather for the sake of the fun than from any bad
      disposition.</p>
     <p>His look of consternation was exaggerated into a most comical caricature, in order to hide
      how much of it was real.</p>
     <p>'So you are at that trick, Larkins.'</p>
     <p>'There! that bet is lost!' exclaimed Larkins. 'I laid Hill half-a-crown that you would not
      see me when you were mooning over your verses!'</p>
     <p>'Well, I have seen you. And now—?'</p>
     <p>'Come, you would not thrash a fellow when you have just lost him half-a-crown! Single
      misfortunes never come alone, they say; so there's my money and my credit gone, to say nothing
      of Ballhatchet's ginger-beer!'</p>
     <p>The boy made such absurd faces, that Norman could hardly help laughing, though he wished to
      make it a serious affair. 'You know, Larkins, I have given out that such things are not to be.
      It is a melancholy fact.'</p>
     <p>'Aye! so you must make an example of me!' said Larkins, pretending to look resigned. 'Better
      call all the fellows together, hadn't you, and make it more effective? It would be grateful to
      <pb n="215"/> one's feelings, you know—and June,' added he, with a ridiculous confidential
      air, 'if you'll only lay it on soft, I'll take care it makes noise enough. Great cry, little
      wool, you know.'</p>
     <p>'Come with me,' said Norman. 'I'll take care you are example enough. What did you give for
      those articles?'</p>
     <p>'Fifteen-pence half-penny. Rascally dear, isn't it? but the old rogue makes one pay double
      for the risk! You are making his fortune, you have raised his prices fourfold.'</p>
     <p>'I'll take care of that.'</p>
     <p>'Why, where are you taking me? Back to him?'</p>
     <p>'I am going to gratify your wish to be an example.'</p>
     <p>'A gibbet! a gibbet!' cried Larkins. 'I'm to be turned off on the spot where the crime took
      place—a warning to all beholders. Only let me send home for old Neptune's chain, if you
      please, sir— if you hang me in the combined watch-chains of the school, I fear they would give
      way, and defeat the purposes of justice.'</p>
     <p>They were by this time at the bridge. 'Come in,' said Norman, to his follower, as he crossed
      the entrance of the little shop, the first time he had ever been there. A little cringing
      shrivelled old man stood up in astonishment.</p>
     <p>'Mr. May! can I have the pleasure, sir?'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ballhatchet, you know that it is contrary to the rules that there should be any traffic
      with the school without special permission.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, sir—just nothing sir—only when the young gentlemen come here, sir—I'm an old man, sir,
      and I don't like not to oblige a young gentleman, sir,' pleaded the old man, in a great
      fright.</p>
     <p>'Very likely,' said Norman, 'but I am come to give you fair notice. I am not going to allow
      the boys here to be continually smuggling spirits into the school.'</p>
     <p>'Spirits! bless you, sir, I never thought of no sich a thing! 'Tis nothing in life but
      ginger-beer—very cooling drink, sir, of my wife's making; she had the receipt from her
      grandmother up in Leicestershire. Won't you taste a bottle, sir?' and he hastily made a cork
      bounce, and poured it out.</p>
     <p>That, of course, was genuine, but Norman was 'up to him,' in school-boy phrase.</p>
     <p>'Give me yours, Larkins.'</p>
     <p>No pop ensued. Larkins, enjoying the detection, put his hands on his knees, and looked
      wickedly up in the old man's face to see what was coming.</p>
     <p>'Bless me! It is a little flat. I wonder how that happened? I'll be most happy to change it,
      sir. Wife! what's the meaning of Mr. Larkins's ginger-pop being so flat?'</p>
     <pb n="216"/>
     <p>'It is very curious ginger-beer indeed, Mr. Ballhatchet,' said Norman; 'and since it is
      liable to have such strange properties, I cannot allow it to be used any more at the
      school.'</p>
     <p>'Very well, sir—as you please, sir. You are the first gentleman as has objected, sir.'</p>
     <p>'And, once for all, I give you warning,' added Norman, 'that if I have reason to believe you
      have been obliging the young gentlemen, the magistrates and the trustees of the road shall
      certainly hear of it.'</p>
     <p>'You would not hurt a poor man, sir, as is drove to it—you as has such a name for
      goodness.'</p>
     <p>'I have given you warning,' said Norman. 'The next time I find any of your bottles in the
      school fields, your license goes. Now, there are your goods. Give Mr. Larkins back the
      fifteen-pence. I wonder you are not ashamed of such a charge!'</p>
     <p>Having extracted the money, Norman turned to leave the shop. Larkins, triumphant, 'Ha!
      there's Harrison!' as the tutor rode by, and they touched their caps. 'How he stared! My eyes!
      June, you'll be had up for dealing with old Ball!' and he went into an ecstasy of laughing.
      'You've settled him, I believe. Well, is justice satisfied?'</p>
     <p>'It would be no use thrashing you,' said Norman, laughing, as he leant against the parapet
      of the bridge, and pinched the boy's ear. 'There's nothing to be got out of you but
      chaff.'</p>
     <p>Larkins was charmed with the compliment.</p>
     <p>'But I'll tell you what, Larkins, I can't think how a fellow like you can go and give in to
      these sneaking, underhand tricks that make you ashamed to look one in the face.'</p>
     <p>'It is only for the fun of it.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I wish you would find your fun some other way. Come, Larkins, recollect yourself a
      little—you have a home not so far off. How do you think your father and mother would fancy
      seeing you reading the book you had yesterday, or coming out of Ballhatchet's with a bottle of
      spirits, called by a false name?'</p>
     <p>Larkins pinched his fingers; home was a string that could touch him, but it seemed beneath
      him to own it. At that moment a carriage approached, the boy's whole face lighted up, and he
      jumped forward. 'Our own!' he cried. 'There she is!'</p>
     <p><hi>She</hi> was, of course, his mother; and Norman, though turning hastily away that his
      presence might prove no restraint, saw the boy fly over the door of the open carriage, and
      could have sobbed at the thought of what that meeting was.</p>
     <p>'Who was that with you?' asked Mrs. Larkins, when she had obtained leave to have her boy
      with her, while she did her shopping.</p>
     <p>'That was May senior, our Dux.'</p>
     <pb n="217"/>
     <p>'Was it? I am very glad you should be with him, my dear George. He is very kind to you, I
      hope?'</p>
     <p>'He is a jolly good fellow,' said Larkins, sincerely, though by no means troubling himself
      as to the appropriateness of the eulogy, nor thinking it necessary to explain to his mother
      the terms of the conversation.</p>
     <p>It was not fruitless; Larkins did avoid mischief when it was not extremely inviting, was
      more amenable to May senior, and having been put in mind by him of his home, was not ashamed
      to bring the thought to the aid of his eyes, when, on Sunday, during a long sermon of Mr.
      Ramsden's, he knew that Axworthy was making the grimace which irresistibly incited him to make
      a still finer one.</p>
     <p>And Ballhatchet was so much convinced of 'that there young May' being in earnest, that he
      assured his persuasive customers that it was as much as his license was worth, to supply
      them.</p>
     <p>Evil and insubordination were more easily kept under than Norman had expected, when he first
      made up his mind to the struggle. Firmness had so far carried the day, and the power of manful
      assertion of the right had been proved, contrary to Cheviot's parting auguries, that he would
      only make himself disliked, and do no good.</p>
     <p>The whole of the school was extremely excited this summer by a proceeding of Mr. Tomkins,
      the brewer, who suddenly closed up the foot-way called Randall's Alley, declaring that there
      was no right of passage through a certain field at the back of his brewery. Not only the
      school, but the town was indignant, and the Mays especially so. It had been the Doctor's way
      to school forty years ago, and there were recollections connected with it that made him regard
      it with personal affection. Norman, too, could not bear to lose it; he had not entirely
      conquered his reluctance to pass that spot in the High Street, and the loss of the alley would
      be a positive deprivation to him. Almost every native of Stoneborough felt strongly the
      encroachment of the brewer, and the boys, of course, carried the sentiment to
      exaggeration.</p>
     <p>The propensity to public speaking perhaps added to the excitement, for Norman May, and
      Harvey Anderson, for once in unison, each made a vehement harangue in the
      school-court—Anderson's a fine specimen of the village Hampden style, about Britons never
      suffering indignities, and free-born Englishmen swelling at injuries.</p>
     <p>'That they do, my hearty,' interjected Larkins, pointing to an inflamed eye that had not
      returned to its right dimensions. However, Anderson went on unmoved by the under titter, and
      demonstrated,
      <pb n="218"/> to the full satisfaction of all the audience, that nothing could be more illegal
      and unfounded than the brewer's claims.</p>
     <p>Then came a great outburst from Norman, with all his father's headlong vehemence; the way
      was the right of the town, the walk had been trodden by their forefathers for generations
      past—it had been made by the good old generous-hearted man who loved his town and townspeople,
      and would have heard with shame and anger of a stranger, a new inhabitant, a grasping radical,
      caring, as radicals always did, for no rights, but for their own chance of unjust gains,
      coming here to Stoneborough to cut them off from their own path. He talk of liberalism and the
      rights of the poor! He who cut off Randall's poor old creatures in the almshouses from their
      short way! and then came some stories of his oppression as a poor-law guardian, which greatly
      aggravated the wrath of the speaker and audience, though otherwise they did not exactly bear
      on the subject. 'What would old Nicholas Randall say to these nineteenth-century doings!'
      finished Norman.</p>
     <p>'Down with them!' cried a voice from the throng, probably Larkins's; but there was no desire
      to investigate, it was the universal sentiment. 'Down with it! Hurrah, we'll have our footpath
      open again! Down with the fences! Britons never shall be slaves!' as Larkins finally
      ejaculated.</p>
     <p>'That's the way to bring it to bear!' said Harvey Anderson. 'See if he dares to bring an
      action against us. Hurrah!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, that's the way to settle it,' said Norman. 'Let's have it down. It is an oppressive,
      arbitrary, shameful proceeding, and we'll show him we won't submit to it!'</p>
     <p>Carried along by the general feeling, the whole troop of boys dashed shouting up to the
      barricade at the entrance of the field, and levelled it with the ground. A handkerchief was
      fastened to the top of one of the stakes, and waved over the brewhouse wall, and some of the
      boys were for picking up stones and dirt, and launching them over, in hopes of spoiling the
      beer; but Norman put a stop to this, and brought them back to the school-yard, still in a
      noisy state of exultation.</p>
     <p>It cooled a little by-and-by under the doubt how their exploit would be taken. At home,
      Norman found it already known, and his father half glad, half vexed, enjoying the victory over
      Tomkins, yet a little uneasy on his son's behalf. 'What will Dr. Hoxton say to the
       <hi>dux?</hi> ' said he. 'I didn't know he was to be <hi>dux</hi> in mischief as well as out
      of it.'</p>
     <p>'You can't call it mischief, papa, to resent an unwarranted encroachment of our rights by
      such an old ruffian as that. One's blood is up to think of the things he has done!'</p>
     <pb n="219"/>
     <p>'He richly deserves it, no doubt,' said the Doctor, 'and yet I wish you had been out of the
      row. If there is any blame, you will be the first it will light on.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad of it, that is but just. Anderson and I seem to have stirred it up—if it wanted
      stirring—for it was in every fellow there; indeed, I had no notion it was coming to this when
      I began.'</p>
     <p>'Oratory,' said the Doctor, smiling. 'Ha, Norman! Think a little another time, my boy,
      before you take the law into your own hands, or, what is worse, into a lot of hands you can't
      control for good, though you may excite them to harm.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Hoxton did not come into school at the usual hour, and, in the course of the morning,
      sent for May senior, to speak to him in his study.</p>
     <p>He looked very broad, awful, and dignified, as he informed him that Mr. Tomkins had just
      been with him to complain of the damage that had been done, and he appeared extremely
      displeased that the <hi>Dux</hi> should have been no check on such proceedings.</p>
     <p>'I am sorry, sir,' said Norman, 'but I believe it was the general feeling that he had no
      right to stop the alley, and, therefore, that it could not be wrong to break it down.'</p>
     <p>'Whether he has a right or not, is not a question to be settled by you. So I find that you,
      whose proper office it is to keep order, have been inflaming the mischievous and aggressive
      spirit amongst the others. I am surprised at you; I thought you were more to be depended upon,
      May, in your position.'</p>
     <p>Norman coloured a good deal, and simply answered, 'I am sorry, sir.'</p>
     <p>'Take care, then, that nothing of the kind happens again,' said Dr. Hoxton, who was very
      fond of him, and did not find fault with him willingly.</p>
     <p>That the first inflammatory discourse had been made by Anderson, did not appear to be
      known—he only came in for the general reprimand given to the school.</p>
     <p>It was reported the following evening, just as the town boys turned out to go to their
      homes, that 'old Tomkins had his fence up five times higher than before.'</p>
     <p>'Have at him again, say I!' exclaimed Axworthy. 'What business has he coming stopping up
      ways that were made before he was born?'</p>
     <p>'We shall catch it from the Doctor if we do,' said Edward Anderson. 'He looked in no end of
      a rage yesterday when he talked about the credit of the school.'</p>
     <p>'Who cares for the credit of the school?' said the elder Anderson; 'we are out of the school
      now—we are townsmen—Stoneborough
      <pb n="220"/> boys—citizens not bound to submit to injustice. No, no, the old rogue knew it
      would not stand if it was brought into court, so he brings down old Hoxton on us instead—a
      dirty trick he deserves to be punished for.'</p>
     <p>And there was a general shout and yell in reply.</p>
     <p>'Anderson,' said Norman, 'you had better not excite them again, they are ripe for mischief.
      It will go further than it did yesterday —don't you see?'</p>
     <p>Anderson could not afford to get into a scrape without May to stand before him, and rather
      sulkily he assented.</p>
     <p>'It is of no use to rave about old Tomkins,' proceeded Norman, in his style of popular
      oratory. 'If it is illegal, some one will go to law about it, and we shall have our alley
      again. We have shown him our mind once, and that is enough; if we let him alone now, he will
      see 'tis only because we are ordered, not for his sake. It would be just putting him in the
      right, and may be winning his cause for him, to use any more violence. There's law for you,
      Anderson. So now no more about it—let us all go home like rational fellows. August, where's
      August?'</p>
     <p>Tom was not visible—he generally avoided going home with his brother, and Norman having seen
      the boys divide into two or three little parties, as their roads lay homewards, found he had
      an hour of light for an expedition of his own, along the bank of the river. He had taken up
      botany with much ardour, and sharing the study with Margaret was a great delight to both.
      There was a report that the rare yellow bog-bean grew in a meadow about a mile and a half up
      the river, and thither he was bound, extremely enjoying the summer evening walk, as the fresh
      dewy coolness sunk on all around, and the noises of the town were mellowed by distance, and
      the sun's last beams slanted on the green meadows, and the May-flies danced, and dragon-flies
      darted, and fish rose or leapt high in the air, or showed their spotted sides, and opened and
      shut their gills, as they rested in the clear water, and the evening breeze rustled in the
      tall reeds, and brought fragrance from the fresh-mown hay.</p>
     <p>It was complete enjoyment to Norman after his day's study, and the rule and watch over the
      unruly crowd of boys, and he walked and wandered, and collected plants for Margaret till the
      sun was down, and the grasshoppers chirped clamorously, while the fern-owl purred, and the
      beetle hummed, and the skimming swallows had given place to the soft-winged bat, and the large
      white owl floating over the fields as it moused in the long grass.</p>
     <p>The summer twilight was sobering every tint, when, as Norman crossed the cricket-field, he
      heard, in the distance, a loud shout. He looked up, and it seemed to him that he saw some
      black specks
      <pb n="221"/> dancing in the forbidden field, and something like the waving of a flag, but it
      was not light enough to be certain, and he walked quickly home.</p>
     <p>The front door was fastened, and, while he was waiting to be let in, Mr. Harrison walked by,
      and called out, 'You are late at home to-night—it is half-past nine.'</p>
     <p>'I have been taking a walk, Sir.'</p>
     <p>A good-night was the answer, as he was admitted. Everyone in the drawing-room looked up, and
      exclaimed, as he entered, 'Where's Tom?'</p>
     <p>'What! he is not come home?'</p>
     <p>'No! Was he not with you?'</p>
     <p>'I missed him after school. I was persuaded he was come home. I have been to look for the
      yellow bog-bean. There, Margaret. Had not I better go and look for him?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, do,' said Dr. May. 'The boy is never off one's mind.'</p>
     <p>A sort of instinctive dread directed Norman's steps down the open portion of Randall's
      Alley, and, voices growing louder as he came nearer, confirmed his suspicions. The fence at
      this end was down, and, on entering the field, a gleam of light met his eye on the ground—a
      cloud of smoke, black figures were flitting round it, pushing brands into red places, and
      feeding the bonfire.</p>
     <p>'What have you been doing?' exclaimed Norman. 'You have got yourselves into a tremendous
      scrape!'</p>
     <p>A peal of laughter, and shout of 'Randall and Stoneborough for ever!' was the reply.</p>
     <p>'August! May junior! Tom! answer me! Is he here?' asked Norman, not solicitous to identify
      anyone.</p>
     <p>But gruff voices broke in upon them. 'There they are, nothing like 'em for mischief.'</p>
     <p>'Come, young gentlemen,' said a policeman, 'be off, if you please. We don't want to have
      none of you at the Station to-night.'</p>
     <p>A general hurry-skurry ensued. Norman alone, strong in innocence, walked quietly away, and,
      as he came forth from the darkness of the Alley, beheld something scouring away before him, in
      the direction of home. It popped in at the front door before him, but was not in the
      drawing-room. He strode up-stairs, called, but was not answered, and found, under the
      bed-clothes, a quivering mass, consisting of Tom, with all his clothes on, fully persuaded
      that it was the policeman who was pursuing him.</p>

     <p>Doctor May was called for late the next day, Friday, and spent some time in one of
      the houses near the river. It was nearly eight o'clock when he came away, and he lingered,
      looking towards the school, in hopes of a walk home with his boys.</p>
     <p>Presently he saw Norman come out from under the archway, his cap drawn over his face, and
      step, gesture, and manner, betraying that something was seriously wrong. He came up almost to
      his father without seeing him, until startled by his exclamation, 'Norman —why Norman, what's
      the matter?'</p>
     <p>Norman's lips quivered, and his face was pale—he seemed as if he could not speak.</p>
     <p>'Where's Tom?' said the Doctor, much alarmed. 'Has he got into disgrace about this business
      of Tomkins? That boy—'</p>
     <p>'He has only got an imposition,' interrupted Norman. 'No, it is not that—it is myself,—' and
      it was only with a gulp and struggle that he brought out the words, 'I am turned down in the
      school.'</p>
     <p>The Doctor started back a step or two, aghast. 'What—how— speak, Norman. What have you
      done?'</p>
     <p>'Nothing!' said Norman, recovering, in the desire to re-assure his father, 'nothing!'</p>
     <p>'That's right,' said the Doctor, breathing freely, 'What's the meaning of it... a
      misunderstanding?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman, with bitterness. 'It is all Anderson's doing —a word from him would have
      set all straight—but he would not— I believe, from my heart, he held his tongue to get me
      down, that he might have the Randall!'</p>
     <p>'We'll see you righted,' said the Doctor, eagerly. 'Come, tell me the whole story, Norman.
      Is it about this unlucky business?'</p>
     <p>'Yes. The town-fellows were all up about it last evening, when we came out of school.
      Anderson senior himself began to put them up to having the fence down again. Yes, that he
      did—I remember his very words—that Tomkins could not bring it into Court, and so set old
      Hoxton at us. Well, I told them it would not do,—thought I had settled them—saw them off
      home—yes, Simpson, and Benson,
      <pb n="223"/> and Grey, up the High Street, and the others their way. I only left Axworthy
      going into a shop when I set off on my walk. What could a fellow do more? How was I to know
      that that Axworthy would get them together again, and take them to this affair—pull up the
      stakes—saw them down—for they were hard to get down— shy all sorts of things over into the
      court—hoot at old Tomkins's man, when he told them to be off—and make a bonfire of the sticks
      at last?'</p>
     <p>'And Harvey Anderson was there?'</p>
     <p>'No—not he. He is too sharp—born and bred attorney as he is—he talked them up to the
      mischief when my back was turned, and then sneaked quietly home, quite innocent, and out of
      the scrape.'</p>
     <p>'But Doctor Hoxton can never entertain a suspicion that you had anything to do with it.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, he does though. He thinks I incited them, and Tomkins and the policeman declare I was
      there in the midst of the row—and not one of these fellows will explain how I came at the last
      to look for Tom.'</p>
     <p>'Not Tom himself?—'</p>
     <p>'He did try to speak, poor little fellow, but, after the other affair, his word goes for
      nothing, and so, it seems, does mine. I did think Hoxton would have trusted me!'</p>
     <p>'And did not he?' exclaimed Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'He did not in so many words accuse me of—of—but he told me he had serious charges brought
      against me—Mr. Harrison had seen me at Ballhatchet's, setting an example of disregard to
      rules—and, again, Mr. Harrison saw me coming in at a late hour last night. "I know he did," I
      said, and I explained where I had been, and they asked for proofs! I could hardly answer, from
      surprise, at their not seeming to believe me, but I said you could answer for my having come
      in with the flowers for my sister.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure I will—I'll go this instant—' he was turning.</p>
     <p>'It is of no use, papa, to-night; Dr. Hoxton has a dinner-party.'</p>
     <p>'He is always having parties. I wish he would mind them less, and his business more. You
      disbelieved! but I'll see justice done you, Norman, the first thing to-morrow. Well—'</p>
     <p>'Well then, I said, old Ballhatchet could tell that I crossed the bridge at the very time
      they were doing this pretty piece of work, for he was sitting smoking in his porch when I went
      home, and, would you believe it? the old rascal would not remember who passed that evening! It
      is all his malice and revenge—nothing else!'</p>
     <p>'Why—what have you been doing to him?'</p>
     <p>Norman shortly explained the ginger-beer story, and adding,
      <pb n="224"/> 'Cheviot told me I should get nothing but ill-will, and so I have— all those
      town fellows turn against me now, and though they know as well as possible how it was, they
      won't say a word to right me, just out of spite, because I have stopped them from all the
      mischief I could!'</p>
     <p>Well, then—'</p>
     <p>'They asked me whether—since I allowed that I had been there at last—I had dispersed the
      boys. I said no, I had no time. Then they desired to know who was there, and that I had not
      seen; it was all dark, and there had not been a moment, and if I guessed, it was no affair of
      mine to say. So they ordered me down, and had up Ned Anderson, and one or two more who were
      known to have been in the riot, and then they consulted a good while, and sent for me; Mr.
      Wilmot was for me, I am sure, but Harrison was against me. Doctor Hoxton sat there, and made
      me one of his addresses. He said he would not enter on the question whether I had been present
      at the repetition of the outrage, as he called it, but what was quite certain was, that I had
      abused my authority and influence in the school; I had been setting a bad example, and
      breaking the rules about Ballhatchet, and so far from repressing mischief, I had been the
      foremost in it, making inflammatory harangues, leading them to commit violence the first time,
      and the next, if not actually taking part in it personally, at any rate, not preventing it. In
      short, he said it was clear I had not weight enough for my post—it was some excuse I had been
      raised to it so young—but it was necessary to show that proficiency in studies did not
      compensate for disregard of discipline, and so he turned me down below the first six! So
      there's another May in disgrace!'</p>
     <p>'It shall not last—it shall not last, my boy,' said Dr. May, pressing Norman's arm; 'I'll
      see you righted. Dr. Hoxton shall hear the whole story. I am not for fathers interfering in
      general, but if ever there was a case, this is! Why, it is almost actionable —injuring your
      whole prospects in life, and all because he will not take the trouble to make an
      investigation! It is a crying shame.'</p>
     <p>'Every fellow in the school knows how it was,' said Norman; 'and plenty of them would be
      glad to tell, if they had only the opportunity; but he asked no one but those two or three
      worst fellows that were at the fire, and they would not tell, on purpose. The school will go
      to destruction now—they'll get their way, and all I have been striving for is utterly
      undone.'</p>
     <p>'You setting a bad example! Dr. Hoxton little knows what you have been doing. It is a
      mockery, as I have always said, to see that old fellow sit wrapped up in his pomposity, eating
      his good dinners, and knowing no more what goes on among his boys than
      <pb n="225"/> this umbrella! But he will listen to me—and we'll make those boys confess the
      whole—aye, and have up Ballhatchet himself, to say what your traffic with him was; and we will
      see what old Hoxton says to you then, Norman.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May and his son felt keenly and spoke strongly. There was so much of sympathy and
      fellow-feeling between them, that there was no backwardness on Norman's part in telling his
      whole trouble, with more confidence than school-boys often show towards their fathers, and Dr.
      May entered into the mortification as if he were still at school. They did not go into the
      house, but walked long up and down the garden, working themselves up into, if possible,
      stronger indignation, and concerting the explanation for to-morrow, when Dr. May meant to go
      at once to the head master, and make him attend to the true version of the story, appealing to
      Harvey Anderson himself, Larkins, and many others, for witnesses. There could be hardly a
      doubt that Norman would be thus exculpated; but, if Dr. Hoxton would not see things in their
      true light, Dr. May was ready to take him away at once, rather than see him suffer
      injustice.</p>
     <p>Still, though comforted by his father's entire reliance, Norman was suffering severely under
      the sense of indignity, and grieved that Dr. Hoxton, and the other masters, should have
      believed him guilty —that name of May could never again boast of being without reproach. To be
      in disgrace stung him to the quick, even though undeservedly, and he could not bear to go in,
      meet his sisters, and be pitied. 'There's no need they should know of it,' said he, when the
      Minster clock pealing ten, obliged them to go in doors, and his father agreed. They bade each
      other good-night, with the renewal of the promise that Dr. Hoxton should be forced to hear
      Norman's vindication the first thing to-morrow, Harvey Anderson be disappointed of what he
      meanly triumphed in, and Norman be again in his post at the head of the school, in more honour
      and confidence than ever, putting down evil, and making Stoneborough what it ought to be.</p>
     <p>As Dr. May lay awake in the summer's morning, meditating on his address to Dr. Hoxton, he
      heard the unwelcome sound of a ring at the bell, and, in a few minutes, a note was brought to
      him.</p>
     <p>'Tell Adams to get the gig ready—I'll let him know whether he is to go with me.'</p>
     <p>And, in a few minutes, the Doctor opened Norman's door, and found him dressed, and standing
      by the window, reading. 'What, up already, Norman? I came to tell you that our affairs must
      wait till the afternoon. It is very provoking, for Hoxton may be gone out, but Mr. Lake's son,
      at Groveswood, has an attack on the head,
      <pb n="226"/> and I must go at once. It is a couple of dozen miles off or more. I have hardly
      ever been there, and it may keep me all day.'</p>
     <p>'Shall you go in the gig? Shall I drive you?' said Norman, looking rather blank.</p>
     <p>'That's what I thought of, if you like it. I thought you would sooner be out of the
      way.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you—yes, papa. Shall I come and help you to finish dressing?'</p>
     <p>Yes, do, thank you; it will hasten matters. Only, first order in some breakfast. What makes
      you up so early? Have not you slept?'</p>
     <p>'Not much—it has been such a hot night.'</p>
     <p>'And you have a head-ache. Well, we will find a cure for that before the day is over. I have
      settled what to say to old Hoxton.'</p>
     <p>Before another quarter of an hour had passed, they were driving through the deep lanes, the
      long grass thickly laden with morning dew, which beaded the webs of the spiders, and rose in
      clouds of mist under the influence of the sun's rays. There was stillness in the air at first,
      then the morning sounds, the labourer going forth, the world wakening to life, the opening
      houses, the children coming out to school. In spite of the tumult of feeling, Norman could not
      but be soothed and refreshed by the new and fair morning scene, and both minds quitted the
      school politics, as Dr. May talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home in early dawn,
      the more delicious after a sad watch in a sick room, and told of the fair sights he had seen
      at such unwonted hours.</p>
     <p>They had far to go, and the heat of the day had come on before they entered the place of
      their destination. It was a woodland village, built on a nook in the side of the hill, sloping
      greenly to the river, and shut in by a white gate, which seemed to gather all in one, the
      little low old-fashioned church, its yard, shaded with trees, and enclosed by long white
      rails; the parsonage, covered with climbing plants and in the midst of a gay garden; and one
      or two cottages. The woods cast a cool shadow, and, in the meadows by the river, rose cocks of
      new-made hay; there was an air of abiding serenity about the whole place, save that there
      stood an old man by the gate, evidently watching for the physician's carriage; and where the
      sun fell on that parsonage-house was a bedroom window wide open, with the curtains drawn.</p>
     <p>'Thank Heaven, you are come, Sir,' said the old man—'he is fearfully bad.'</p>
     <p>Norman knew young Lake, who had been a senior boy when he first went to school, was a
      Randall scholar, and had borne
      <pb n="227"/> an excellent character, and highly distinguished himself at the University. And
      now, by all accounts, he seemed to be dying— in the height of honour and general esteem. Dr.
      May went into the house, the old man took the horse, and Norman lingered under the trees in
      the church-yard, watching the white curtains now and then puffed by the fitful summer breeze,
      as he lay on the turf in the shade, under the influence of the gentle sadness around, resting,
      mind and body, from the tossing tumultuous passionate sensations that had kept him restless
      and miserable through the hot night.</p>
     <p>He waited long—one hour, two hours had passed away, but he was not impatient, and hardly
      knew how long the time had been before his father and Mr. Lake came out of the house together,
      and, after they parted, Dr. May summoned him. He of course asked first for the patient. 'Not
      quite so hopeless as at first,' and the reasons for having been kept so long were detailed,
      with many circumstances of the youth's illness, and the parents' resignation, by which Dr. May
      was still too deeply touched to have room in his mind for anything besides.</p>
     <p>They were more than half-way home, and a silence had succeeded the conversation about the
      Lake family, when Norman spoke:</p>
     <p>'Papa, I have been thinking about it, and I believe it would he better to let it alone, if
      you please.'</p>
     <p>'Not apply to Dr. Hoxton!' exclaimed his father.</p>
     <p>'Well, I think not. I have been considering it, and it does hardly seem to me the right
      thing. You see, if I had not you close at hand, this could never be explained, and it seems
      rather hard upon Anderson, who has no father, and the other fellows, who have theirs further
      off—'</p>
     <p>'Right, Norman, that is what my father before me always said, and the way I have always
      acted myself; much better let a few trifles go on not just as one would wish, than be for ever
      interfering. But I really think this is a case for it, and I don't think you ought to let
      yourself be influenced by the fear of any party-spirit.'</p>
     <p>'It is not only that, papa—I have been thinking a good deal to-day, and there are other
      reasons. Of course I should wish Dr. Hoxton to know that I spoke the truth about that walk,
      and I hope you will let him know, as I appealed to you. But, on cooler thoughts, I don't
      believe Dr. Hoxton could seriously suspect me of such a thing as that, and it was not on that
      ground that I am turned down, but that I did not keep up sufficient discipline, and allowed
      the outrage, as he calls it. Now, you know, that is, after a fashion, true. If I had not gone
      on like an ass the other day, and incited them to pull down the fences, they would not have
      done it afterwards, and perhaps,
      <pb n="228"/> I ought to have kept on guard longer. It was my fault, and we can't deny
      it.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May made a restless, reluctant movement. 'Well, well, I suppose it was—but it was just
      as much Harvey Anderson's—and is he to get the scholarship because he has added meanness to
      the rest?'</p>
     <p>'He was not Dux,' said Norman, with a sigh. 'It was more shabby than I thought was even in
      him. But I don't know that the feeling about him is not one reason. There has always been a
      rivalry and bitterness between us two, and if I were to get the upper hand now, by means not
      in the usual course, such as the fellows would think ill of, it would be worse than ever, and
      I should always feel guilty and ashamed to look at him.'</p>
     <p>'Over-refining, Norman,' muttered Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Besides, don't you remember, when his father died, how glad you and everyone were to get
      him a nomination, and it was said that if he gained a scholarship, it would be such a relief
      to poor Mrs. Anderson? Now he has this chance, it does seem hard to deprive her of it. I
      should not like to know that I had done so.'</p>
     <p>'Whew!' the Doctor gave a considering whistle.</p>
     <p>'You could not make it straight, papa, without explaining about the dealing with
      Ballhatchet, and that would be unfair to them all, even the old rogue himself; for I promised
      to say nothing about former practices, as long as he did not renew them.'</p>
     <p>'Well! I don't want to compromise you, Norman. You know your own ground best, but I don't
      like it at all. You don't know the humiliation of disgrace. Those who have thought highly of
      you, now thinking you changed—I don't know how to bear it for you.'</p>
     <p>'I don't mind anything while you trust me,' said Norman, eagerly; 'not much I mean, except
      Mr. Wilmot. You must judge, papa, and do as you please.'</p>
     <p>'No, you must judge, Norman. Your confidence in me ought not to be a restraint. It has
      always been an understood thing that, what you say at home is, as if it had not been said, as
      regards my dealings with the masters.'</p>
     <p>'I know, papa. Well, I'll tell you what brought me to this. I tumbled about all night in a
      rage, when I thought how they had served me, and of Hoxton's believing it all, and how he
      might only half give in to your representation, and then I gloried in Anderson's coming down
      from his height, and being seen in his true colours. So it went on till morning came, and I
      got up. You know you gave me my mother's little Thomas à Kempis. I always read a bit every
      morning. To-day it was, "Of four things that bring much inward peace." And what do you think
      they were?'</p>
     <pb n="229"/>
     <p>"Be desirous, my son, to do the will of another rather than thine own.</p>
     <p>"Choose always to have less rather than more.</p>
     <p>"Seek always the lowest place, and to be inferior to everyone.</p>
     <p>"Wish always and pray that the will of God may be wholly fulfilled in thee."</p>
     <p>'I liked them the more, because it was just like her last reading with us, and like that
      letter.—Well, then I wondered as I lay on the grass at Groveswood, whether she would have
      thought it best for me to be reinstated, and I found out that I should have been rather afraid
      of what you might say when she had talked it over with you.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May smiled a little at the simplicity with which this last was said, but his smile ended
      in one of his heavy sighs. 'So you took her for your counsellor, my boy. That was the way to
      find out what was right.'</p>
     <p>'Well, there was something in the place, and, in watching poor Lake's windows, that made me
      not able to dwell so much on getting on, and having prizes and scholarships. I thought that
      caring for those had been driven out of me, and you know I never felt as if it were my right
      when I was made Dux; but now I find it is all come back. It does not do for me to be first; I
      have been what she called elated, and been more peremptory than need with the lower boys, and
      gone on in my old way with Richard, and so I suppose this disgrace has come to punish me. I
      wish it were not disgrace, because of our name at school, and because it will vex Harry so
      much; but since it is come, considering all things, I suppose I ought not to struggle to
      justify myself at other people's expense.'</p>
     <p>His eyes were so dazzled with tears, that he could hardly see to drive, nor did his father
      speak at first. 'I can't say anything against it, Norman, but I am sorry, and one thing more
      you should consider. If Dr. Hoxton should view this absurd business in the way he seems to do,
      it will stand in your way for ever in testimonials, if you try for anything else.'</p>
     <p>'Do you think it will interfere with my having a Confirmation ticket?'</p>
     <p>'Why no, I should not think—such a boyish escapade could be no reason for refusing you
      one.'</p>
     <p>'Very well then, it had better rest. If there should be any difficulty about my being
      Confirmed, of course we will explain it.'</p>
     <p>'I wish everyone showed themselves as well prepared!' half-muttered the Doctor; then, after
      long musing, 'Well, Norman, I
      <pb n="230"/> give up the scholarship. Poor Mrs. Anderson wants it more than we do, and if the
      boy is a shabby fellow, the more he wants a decent education. But what do you say to this? I
      make Hoxton do you full justice, and reinstate you in your proper place, and then I take you
      away at once—send you to a tutor—anything, till the end of the long vacation.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Norman, pausing. 'I don't know, papa. I am very much obliged to you, but I
      think it would hardly do. You would be uncomfortable at seeming to quarrel with Dr. Hoxton,
      and it would be hardly creditable for me to go off in anger.'</p>
     <p>'You are right, I believe,' said Dr. May. 'You judge wisely, though I should not have
      ventured to ask it of you. But what is to become of the discipline of the school? Is that all
      to go to the dogs?'</p>
     <p>'I could not do anything with them if I were restored in this way; they would be more set
      against me. It is bad enough as it is, but, even for my own peace, I believe it is better to
      leave it alone. All my comfort in school is over, I know!' and he sighed deeply.</p>
     <p>'It is a most untoward business!' said the Doctor. 'I am very sorry your school-days should
      be clouded—but it can't be helped, and you will work yourself into a character again. You are
      full young, and can stay for the next Randall.'</p>
     <p>Norman felt as if, while his father looked at him as he now did, the rest of the world were
      nothing to him; but, perhaps, the driving past the school brought him to a different mind, for
      he walked into the house slowly and dejectedly.</p>
     <p>He told his own story to Ethel, in the garden, not without much difficulty, so indignant
      were her exclamations; and it was impossible to make her see that his father's interference
      would put him in an awkward position among the boys. She would argue vehemently that she could
      not bear Mr. Wilmot to think ill of him, that it was a great shame of Dr. Hoxton, and that it
      was dreadful to let such a boy as Harvey Anderson go unpunished. 'I really do think it is
      quite wrong of you to give up your chance of doing good, and leave him in his evil ways!' That
      was all the comforts he gave Norman, and she walked in to pour out a furious grumbling upon
      Margaret.</p>
     <p>Dr. May had been telling the elder ones, and they were in conversation after he had left
      them—Margaret talking with animation, and Flora sitting over her drawing, uttering reluctant
      assents. 'Has he told you, poor fellow?' asked Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel. 'Was there ever such a shame?'</p>
     <p>'That is just what I say,' observed Flora. 'I cannot see why the Andersons are to have a
      triumph over all of us.'</p>
     <pb n="231"/>
     <p>'I used to think Harvey the best of the two,' said Ethel. 'Now, I think he is a great deal
      the worst. Taking advantage of such a mistake as this! How will he ever look Norman in the
      face.'</p>
     <p>'Really,' said Margaret, 'I see no use in aggravating ourselves by talking of the
      Andersons.'</p>
     <p>'I can't think how papa can consent,' proceeded Flora. 'I am sure, if I were in his place, I
      should not!'</p>
     <p>'Papa is so much pleased with dear Norman's behaviour, that it quite makes up for all the
      disappointment,' said Margaret. 'Besides, he is very much obliged to him in one way; he would
      not have liked to have to battle the matter with Dr. Hoxton. He spoke of Norman's great good
      judgment.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, Norman can persuade papa to anything,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I wish papa had not yielded,' said Ethel. 'It would have been just as noble in dear
      Norman, and we should not have the apparent disgrace.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps it is best as it is, after all,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Why, how do you mean?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I think very likely things might have come out. Now, don't look furious, Ethel. Indeed, I
      can't help it, but really I don't think it is explicable why Norman should wish to hush it up,
      unless there were something behind!'</p>
     <p>'Flora!' cried Ethel, too much shocked to bring out another word.</p>
     <p>'If you are unfortunate enough to have such suspicions,' said Margaret, quietly, 'I think it
      would be better to be silent.'</p>
     <p>'As if you did not know Norman!' stammered Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Flora. 'I don't wish to think so. You know I did not hear Norman himself, and
      when papa gives his vehement accounts of things, it always puzzles us of the cooler-minded
      sort.'</p>
     <p>'It is as great a shame as ever I heard!' cried Ethel, recovering her utterance. 'Who would
      you trust, if not your own father and brother?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes,' said Flora, not by any means wishing to displease her sisters. 'If there is such
      a thing as an excess of generosity, it is sure to be among ourselves. I only know it does not
      suit me. It will make us all uncomfortable whenever we meet the Andersons or Mr. Wilmot, or
      anyone else, and as to such tenderness to Harvey Anderson, I think it is thrown away.'</p>
     <p>'Thrown away on the object, perhaps,' said Margaret, 'but not in Norman.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure,' broke out Ethel. 'Better be than seem! Oh, dear! I am sorry I was vexed with
      dear old June when he told me. I had rather have him now than if he had gained everything and
      <pb n="232"/> everyone was praising him—that I had!' Harvey Anderson is welcome to be Dux and
      Randall scholar for what I care, while Norman is—while he is, just what we thought of the last
      time we read that Gospel—you know, Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'He is—that he is,' said Margaret, 'and, indeed, it is most beautiful to see how what has
      happened has brought him at once to what she wished, when, perhaps, otherwise it would have
      been a work of long time.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was entirely consoled. Flora thought of the words ' <hi>téte exaltêe</hi> ,' and
      considered herself alone to have sober sense enough to see things in a true light—not that she
      went the length of believing that Norman had any underhand motives, but she thought it very
      discreet in her to think a prudent father would not have been satisfied with such a desire to
      avoid investigation.</p>
     <p>Dr. May would not trust himself to enter on the subject with Dr. Hoxton in conversation; he
      only wrote a note.</p>
     <p>'June 16th.</p>
     <p>'Dear Dr. Hoxton,</p>
     <p>'My son has appealed to me to confirm his account of himself on Thursday evening last. I
      therefore distinctly state that he came in at half-past nine, with his hands full of plants
      from the river, and that he then went out again, by my desire, to look for his little
      brother.</p>
     <p>'Yours, very truly,</p>
     <p><hi>'R. May.'</hi></p>
     <p>A long answer came in return, disclaiming all doubt of Norman's veracity, and explaining Dr.
      Hoxton's grounds for having degraded him. There had been misconduct in the school, he said,
      for some time past, and he did not consider that it was any very serious reproach, to a boy of
      Norman's age, that he had not had weight enough to keep up his authority, and had been carried
      away by the general feeling. It had been necessary to make an example for the sake of
      principle, and though very sorry it should have fallen on one of such high promise and general
      good conduct, Dr. Hoxton trusted that it would not be any permanent injury to his prospects,
      as his talents had raised him to his former position in the school so much earlier than
      usual.</p>
     <p>'The fact was,' said Dr. May, 'that old Hoxton did it in a passion, feeling he must punish
      somebody, and now, finding there's no uproar about it, he begins to be sorry. I won't answer
      this note. I'll stop after church to-morrow and shake hands, and that will show we don't bear
      malice.'</p>
     <p>What Mr. Wilmot might think, was felt by all to affect them more nearly. Ethel wanted to
      hear that he declared his complete conviction of Norman's innocence, and was disappointed to
      find that he did not once allude to the subject. She was only consoled by
      <pb n="233"/> Margaret's conjecture that, perhaps, he thought the head-master had been hasty,
      and could not venture to say so—he saw into people's characters, and it was notorious that it
      was just what Dr. Hoxton did not.</p>
     <p>Tom had spent the chief of that Saturday in reading a novel borrowed from Axworthy, keeping
      out of sight of everyone. All Sunday he avoided Norman more scrupulously than ever, and again
      on Monday. That day was a severe trial to Norman; the taking the lower place, and the sense
      that, excel as much as ever he might in his studies, it would not avail to restore him to his
      former place, were more unpleasant, when it came to the point, than he had expected.</p>
     <p>He saw the cold manner, so different from the readiness with which his tasks had always been
      met, certain as they were of being well done; he found himself among the common herd whom he
      had passed so triumphantly, and, for a little while, he had no heart to exert himself.</p>
     <p>This was conquered by the strong will and self-rebuke for having merely craved for applause,
      but, in the play-ground, he found himself still alone—the other boys who had been raised by
      his fall, shrank from intercourse with one whom they had injured by their silence, and the
      Andersons, who were wont to say the Mays carried every tale home, and who still almost
      expected interference from Dr. May, hardly believed their victory secure, and the younger one,
      at least, talked spitefully, and triumphed in the result of May's meddling and troublesome
      over strictness. 'Such prigs always come to a downfall,' was the sentiment.</p>
     <p>Norman found himself left out of everything, and stood dispirited and weary on the bank of
      the river, wishing for Harry, wishing for Cheviot, wishing that he had been able to make a
      friend who would stand by him, thinking it could not be worse if he had let his father
      reinstate him—and a sensation of loneliness and injustice hung heavy at his heart.</p>
     <p>His first interruption was a merry voice. 'I say, June, there's no end of river cray-fish
      under that bank,' and Larkins' droll face was looking up at him, from that favourite position,
      half-stooping, his hands on his knees, his expression of fun trying to conceal his real
      anxiety and sympathy.</p>
     <p>Norman turned and smiled, and looked for the cray-fish, and, at the same time, became aware
      of Hector Ernescliffe, watching for an opportunity to say, 'I have a letter from Alan.' He
      knew they wanted, as far as little boys ventured to seek after one so much their elder, to
      show themselves his friends, and he was grateful; he
      <pb n="234"/> roused himself to hear about Alan's news, and found it was important —his great
      friend, Captain Gordon, had got a ship, and hoped to be able to take him, and this might lead
      to Harry's going with him. Then Norman applied himself to the capture of cray-fish, and
      Larkins grew so full of fun and drollery, that the hours of recreation passed off less
      gloomily than they had begun.</p>
     <p>If only his own brother would have been his adherent! But he saw almost nothing of Tom. Day
      after day he missed him, he was off before him in going and returning from school, and when he
      caught a sight of his face, it looked harassed, pale, and miserable, stealing anxious glances
      after him, yet shrinking from his eye. But, at the same time, Norman did not see him mingling
      with his former friends, and could not make out how he disposed of himself. To be thus
      continually shunned by his own brother, even when the general mass were returning to ordinary
      terms, became so painful, that Norman was always on the watch to seek for one more
      conversation with him.</p>
     <p>He caught him at last in the evening, just as they were going home. 'Tom, why are you
      running away? Come with me,' said he, authoritatively; and Tom obeyed in trembling.</p>
     <p>Norman led the way to the meads. 'Tom,' said he, 'do not let this go on. Why do you serve me
      in this way? You surely need not turn against me,' he said, with pleading melancholy in his
      voice.</p>
     <p>It was not needed. Tom had flung himself upon the grass, and was in an agony of crying, even
      before he had finished the words.</p>
     <p>'Tom, Tom! what is the matter? Have they been bullying you again? Look up, and tell me—what
      is it? You know I can stand by you still, if you'll only let me;' and Norman sat by him on the
      grass, and raised his face by a sort of force, but the kind words only brought more piteous
      sobs. It was a long time before they diminished enough to let him utter a word, but Norman
      went on patiently consoling and inquiring, sure, at least, that here had broken down the
      sullenness that had always repelled him.</p>
     <p>At last came the words, 'Oh! I cannot bear it. It is all my doing!'</p>
     <p>'What—how—you don't mean this happening to me? It is not your doing, August—what fancy is
      this?'</p>
     <p>'O yes, it is,' said Tom, his voice cut short by gasps, the remains of the sobs. 'They would
      not hear me! I tried to tell them how you told them not, and sent them home. I tried to tell
      about Ballhatchet—but—but they wouldn't—they said if it had been Harry, they would have
      attended—but they would not believe me. Oh! if Harry was but here!'</p>
     <pb n="235"/>
     <p>'I wish he was,' said Norman, from the bottom of his heart; 'but you see, Tom, if this sets
      you on always telling truth, I shan't think any great harm done.'</p>
     <p>A fresh burst, 'Oh! they are all so glad! They say such things! And the Mays were never in
      disgrace before. O Norman, Norman!'</p>
     <p>'Never mind about that,—' began Norman.</p>
     <p>'But you would mind,' broke in the boy, passionately, 'if you knew what Anderson junior, and
      Axworthy say! They say it serves you right, and they were going to send me to old
      Ballhatchet's to get some of his stuff to drink confusion to the mouth of June, and all
      pragmatical meddlers; and when I said I could not go, they vowed if I did not, I should eat
      the corks for them! And Anderson junior called me names, and licked me. Look there.' He showed
      a dark blue-and-red stripe, raised on the palm of his hand. 'I could not write well for it
      these three days, and Hawes gave me double copies!'</p>
     <p>'The cowardly fellows!' exclaimed Norman, indignantly. 'But you did not go?'</p>
     <p>'No, Anderson senior stopped them. He said he would not have the Ballhatchet business begin
      again.'</p>
     <p>'That is one comfort,' said Norman. 'I see he does not dare not to keep order. But if you'll
      only stay with me, August, I'll take care they don't hurt you.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! June! June!' and he threw himself across his kind brother. 'I am so very sorry! Oh! to
      see you put down—and hear them! And you to lose the scholarship! Oh, dear! oh, dear! and be in
      disgrace with them all!'</p>
     <p>'But, Tom, do cheer up. It is nothing to be in such distress at. Papa knows all about it,
      and while he does, I don't care half so much.'</p>
     <p>'O, I wish—I wish—'</p>
     <p>You see, Tom,' said Norman, 'after all, though it is very kind of you to be sorry for not
      being able to get me out of this scrape, the thing one wants you to be sorry about, is your
      own affair.'</p>
     <p>'I wish I had never come to school! I wish Anderson would leave me alone! It is all his
      fault! A mean-spirited skulking, bullying—'</p>
     <p>'Hush, hush, Tom, he is bad enough, but now you know what he is, you can keep clear of him
      for the future. Now listen. You and I will make a fresh start, and try if we can't get the
      Mays to be looked on as they were when Harry was here. Let us mind the rules, and get into no
      more mischief.'</p>
     <p>'You'll keep me from Ned Anderson and Axworthy?' whispered Tom.</p>
     <pb n="236"/>
     <p>'Yes, that I will. And you'll try and speak the truth, and be straightforward?</p>
     <p>'I will, I will,' said Tom, worn out in spirits by his long bondage, and glad to catch at
      the hope of relief and protection.</p>
     <p>'Then let us come home,' and Tom put his hand into his brother's, as a few weeks back would
      have seemed most unworthy of schoolboy dignity.</p>
     <p>Thenceforth Tom was devoted to Norman, and kept close to him, sure that the instant he was
      from under his wing, his former companions would fall on him to revenge his defection, but
      clinging to him also from real affection and gratitude. Indolence and timidity were the true
      root of what had for a time seemed like a positively bad disposition; beneath, there was a
      warm heart, and sense of right, which had been almost stifled for the time, in the desire,
      from moment to moment, to avoid present trouble or fear. Under Norman's care his better self
      had freer scope, he was guarded from immediate terror, and kept from the suggestions of the
      worse sort of boys, as much as was in his brother's power; and the looks they cast towards
      him, and the sly torments they attempted to inflict, by no means invited him back to them. The
      lessons, where he had a long inveterate habit of shuffling, came under Norman's eye at the
      same time. He always prepared them in his presence, instead of in the most secret manner
      possible, and with all Anderson's expeditious modes of avoiding the making them of any use.
      Norman sat by, and gave such help as was fair and just, showed him how to learn, and explained
      difficulties, and the ingenuity hitherto spent in eluding learning being now directed to
      gaining it, he began to make real progress, and find satisfaction in it. The comfort of being
      good dawned upon him once more, but still there was much to contend with; he had acquired such
      a habit of prevarication, that, if by any means taken by surprise, his impulse was to avoid
      giving a straightforward answer, and when he recollected his sincerity, the truth came with
      the air of falsehood. Moreover, he was an arrant coward, and provoked tricks by his manifest
      and unreasonable terrors. It was no slight exercise of patience that Norman underwent, but
      this was the interest he had made for himself; and the recovery of the boy's attachment, and
      his improvement, though slow, were a present recompense.</p>
     <p>Ernescliffe, Larkins, and others of the boys, held fast to him, and after the first
      excitement was past, all the rest returned to their former tone. He was decidedly as much
      respected as ever, and, at the same time, regarded with more favour than when his strictness
      was resented. And as for the discipline of the school, that did not suffer. Anderson felt
      that, for his own credit, he must not allow
      <pb n="237"/> the rules to be less observed than in May's reign, and he enforced them upon the
      reluctant and angry boys, with whom he had been previously making common cause. Dr. Hoxton
      boasted to the under-masters that the school had never been in such good order as under
      Anderson, little guessing that this was but reaping the fruits of a past victory, or that
      every boy in the whole school gave the highest place in their esteem to the deposed Dux.</p>
     <p>To Anderson, Norman's cordial manner and ready support, were the strangest part of all, only
      explained by thinking that he deemed it, as he tried to do himself, merely the fortune of war,
      and was sensible of no injury.</p>
     <p>And, for Norman himself, when the first shock was over, and he was accustomed to the change,
      he found the cessation of vigilance a relief, and carried a lighter heart than any time since
      his mother's death. His sisters could not help observing that there was less sadness in the
      expression of his eyes, that he carried his head higher, walked with freedom and elasticity of
      step, tossed and flourished the Daisy till she shouted and crowed, while Margaret shrank at
      such freaks; and, though he was not much of a laugher himself, contributed much sport in the
      way of bright apposite sayings to the home circle.</p>
     <p>It was a very unexpected mode of cure for depression of spirits, but there could be no
      question that it succeeded; and when, a few Saturdays after, he drove Dr. May again to
      Groveswood to see young Mr. Lake, who was recovering, he brought Margaret home a whole pile of
      botanical curiosities, and drew his father into an animated battle over natural and Linnæan

     <p>'Margaret, see here.'</p>
     <p>The Doctor threw into her lap a letter, which made her cheeks light up.</p>
     <p>Mr. Ernescliffe wrote that his father's friend, Captain Gordon, having been appointed to the
      frigate Alcestis, had chosen him as one
      <pb n="238"/> of his lieutenants, and offered a nomination as naval cadet for his brother. He
      had replied that the navy was not Hector's destination, but, as Captain Gordon had no one else
      in view, had prevailed on him to pass on the proposal to Harry May.</p>
     <p>Alan wrote in high terms of his captain, declaring that he esteemed the having sailed with
      him as one of the greatest advantages he had ever received, and adding, that, for his own
      part, Dr. May needed no promise from him, to be assured that he would watch over Harry like
      his own brother. It was believed that the Alcestis was destined for the South American
      station.</p>
     <p>'A three years' business,' said Dr. May, with a sigh. 'But the thing is done, and this is as
      good as we can hope.'</p>
     <p>'Far better!' said Margaret. 'What pleasure it must have given him! Dear Harry could not
      sail under more favourable circumstances.'</p>
     <p>'No, I would trust to Ernescliffe as I would to Richard. It is kindly done, and I will thank
      him at once. Where does he date from?'</p>
     <p>'From Portsmouth. He does not say whether he has seen Harry.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose he waited for my answer. Suppose I inclose a note for him to give to Harry. There
      will be rapture enough, and it is a pity he should not have the benefit of it.'</p>
     <p>The Doctor sat down to write, while Margaret worked and mused, perhaps on outfits and new
      shirts—perhaps on Harry's lion-locks, beneath a blue cap and gold band, or, perchance, on the
      coral shoals of the Pacific.</p>
     <p>It was one of the quiet afternoons, when all the rest were out, and which the Doctor and his
      daughter especially valued, when they were able to spend one together without interruption.
      Soon, however, a ring at the door brought an impatient exclamation from the Doctor; but his
      smile beamed out at the words, 'Miss Rivers.' They were great friends; in fact, on terms of
      some mutual sauciness, though Meta was, as yet, far less at home with his daughters, and came
      in, looking somewhat shy.</p>
     <p>'Ah, your congeners are gone out!' was the Doctor's reception. 'You must put up with our
      sober selves.'</p>
     <p>'Is Flora gone far?' asked Meta.</p>
     <p>'To Cocksmoor,' said Margaret. 'I am very sorry she has missed you.'</p>
     <p>'Shall I be in your way?' said Meta, timidly. 'Papa has several things to do, and said he
      would call for me here.'</p>
     <p>'Good luck for Margaret,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'So they are gone to Cocksmoor!' said Meta. 'How I envy them!'</p>
     <pb n="239"/>
     <p>'You would not, if you saw the place,' said Dr. May. 'I believe Norman is very angry with me
      for letting them go near it.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! but they are of real use there!'</p>
     <p>'And Miss Meta is obliged to take to envying the black-hole of Cocksmoor, instead of being
      content with the eglantine bowers of Abbotstoke! I commiserate her!' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'If I did any good instead of harm at Abbotstoke!'</p>
     <p>'Harm!' exclaimed Margaret.</p>
     <p>'They went on very well without me,' said Meta; 'but ever since I have had the class, they
      have been getting naughtier and noisier every Sunday; and, last Sunday, the prettiest of
      all—the one I liked best, and had done everything for—she began to mimic me—held up her
      finger, as I did, and made them all laugh!'</p>
     <p>'Well, that is very bad!' said Margaret; 'but I suppose she was a very little one.'</p>
     <p>'No, a quick clever one, who knew much better, about nine years old. She used to be always
      at home in the week, dragging about a great baby; and we managed that her mother should afford
      to stay at home, and send her to school. It seemed such a pity her cleverness should be
      wasted.'</p>
     <p>The Doctor smiled. 'Ah! depend upon it, the tyrant-baby was the best disciplinarian.'</p>
     <p>Meta looked extremely puzzled.</p>
     <p>'Papa means,' said Margaret, 'that if she was inclined to be conceited, the being teased at
      home might do her more good than being brought forward at school.'</p>
     <p>'I have done everything wrong, it seems,' said Meta, with a shade of what the French call
       <hi>dêpit</hi> . 'I thought it must be right and good—but it has only done mischief; and now
      papa says they are an ungrateful set, and that, if it vexes me, I had better have no more to
      do with them!'</p>
     <p>'It does not vex you so much as that, I hope,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'O, I could not bear that!' said Meta; 'but it is so different from what I thought!'</p>
     <p>'Ah! you had an Arcadia of good little girls in straw hats, such as I see in Blanche's
      little books,' said the Doctor, 'all making the young lady an oracle, and doing wrong—if they
      do it at all—in the simplest way, just for an example to the others.'</p>
     <p>'Dr. May! How can you know so well? But do you really think it is their fault, or mine?'</p>
     <p>'Do you think me a conjurer?'</p>
     <p>'Well, but what do you think?'</p>
     <p>'What do Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot think?'</p>
     <p>'I know Mrs. Wilmot thinks I spoil my class. She spoke to me
      <pb n="240"/> about making favourites, and sometimes has seemed surprised at things which I
      have done. Last Sunday, she told me she thought I had better have a steadier class, and I know
      whom she will give me—the great big, stupid ones, at the bottom of the first-class! I do
      believe it is only out of good-nature that she does not tell me not to teach at all. I have a
      great mind I will not; I know I do nothing but harm.'</p>
     <p>'What shall you say if I tell you I think so too?' asked the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'O, Dr. May! you don't really? Now, does he, Miss May? I am sure I only want to do them
      good. I don't know what I can have done.'</p>
     <p>Margaret made her perceive that the Doctor was smiling, and she changed her tone, and
      earnestly begged to be told what they thought of the case; for if she should show her concern
      at home, her father and governess would immediately beg her to cease from all connection with
      the school, and she did not feel at all convinced that Mrs. Wilmot liked to have her there.
      Feeling injured by the implied accusation of mismanagement, yet, with a sense of its truth,
      used to be petted, and new to rebuffs, yet with a sincere wish to act rightly, she was much
      perplexed by this, her first reverse, and had come partly with the view of consulting Flora,
      though she had fallen on other counsellors.</p>
     <p>'Margaret, our adviser general,' said the Doctor, 'what do you say? Put yourself in the
      place of Mrs. Charles Wilmot, and say, shall Miss Rivers teach, or not?'</p>
     <p>'I had rather you would, papa.'</p>
     <p>'Not I—I never kept school.'</p>
     <p>'Well, then, I being Mrs. Wilmot, should certainly be mortified if Miss Rivers deserted me,
      because the children were naughty. I think, I think I had rather she came and asked me what
      she had better do.'</p>
     <p>'And you would answer "teach," for fear of vexing her,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'I should, and also for the sake of letting her learn to teach.'</p>
     <p>'The point where only trial shows one's ignorance,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'But I don't want to do it for my own sake,' said Meta. 'I do everything for my own sake
      already.'</p>
     <p>'For their's, then,' said the Doctor. 'If teaching will not come by nature, you must serve
      an apprenticeship, if you mean to be of service in that line. Perhaps, it was the gift that
      the fairies omitted.</p>
     <p>'But will it do any good to them?'</p>
     <p>'I can't tell; but I am sure it would do them harm for you to give it up, because it is
      disagreeable.'</p>
     <pb n="241"/>
     <p>'Well,' said Meta, with a sigh, 'I'll go and talk to Mrs. Wilmot. I could not bear to give
      up anything that seems right, just now, because of the Confirmation.'</p>
     <p>Margaret eagerly inquired, and it appeared that the Bishop had given notice for a
      Confirmation in August, and that Mr. Wilmot was already beginning to prepare his candidates,
      whilst Mr. Ramsden, always tardy, never gave notice till the last moment possible. The hope
      was expressed that Harry might be able to profit by this opportunity; and Harry's prospects
      were explained to Meta; then the Doctor, recollecting something that he wished to say to Mr.
      Rivers, began to ask about the chance of his coming before the time of an engagement of his
      own.</p>
     <p>'He said he should be here at about half-past four,' said Meta. 'He is gone to the station
      to inquire about the trains. Do you know what time the last comes in?'</p>
     <p>'At nine forty-five,' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'That is what we were afraid of. It is for Bellairs, my maid. Her mother is very ill, and
      she is afraid she is not properly nursed. It is about five miles from the Milbury Station, and
      we thought of letting her go with a day-ticket, to see about her. She could go in the morning,
      after I am up; but I don't know what is to be done, for she could not get back before I dress
      for dinner.'</p>
     <p>Margaret felt perfectly aghast at the cool tone, especially after what had passed.</p>
     <p>'It would be quite impossible,' said the Doctor. 'Even going by the eight o'clock train, and
      returning by the last, she would only have two hours to spare—short enough measure for a sick
      mother.</p>
     <p>'Papa means to give her whatever she wants for any nurse she may get.'</p>
     <p>'Is there no one with her mother now?'</p>
     <p>'A son's wife, who, they think, is not kind. Poor Bellairs was so grateful for being allowed
      to go home. I wonder if I could dress for once without her.'</p>
     <p>'Do you know old Crabbe?' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'The dear old man at Abbotstoke? O yes, of course.'</p>
     <p>'There was a very sad case in his family. The mother was dying of a lingering illness, when
      the son met with a bad accident. The only daughter was a lady's maid, and could not be spared,
      though the brother was half crazy to see her, and there was no one to tend them but a wretch
      of a woman, paid by the parish. The poor fellow kept calling for his sister in his delirium,
      and, at last, I could not help writing to the mistress.'</p>
     <p>'Did she let her come?' said Meta, her cheek glowing.</p>
     <p>'As a great favour, she let her set out by the mail train, after
      <pb n="242"/> dressing her for a ball, with orders to return in time for her toilette for an
      evening party the next day.'</p>
     <p>'O, I remember,' said Margaret, 'her coming here at five in the morning, and your taking her
      home.'</p>
     <p>'And when we got to Abbotstoke, the brother was dead. That parish nurse had not attended to
      my directions, and, I do believe, was the cause of it. The mother had had a seizure, and was
      in the most precarions state.</p>
     <p>'Surely she stayed!'</p>
     <p>'It was as much as her place was worth,' said the Doctor; 'and her wages were the chief
      maintenance of the family. So she had to go back to dress her mistress, while the old woman
      lay there, wailing after Betsy. She did give warning then, but, before the month was out, the
      mother was dead.'</p>
     <p>Meta did not speak, and Dr. May presently rose, saying, he should try to meet Mr. Rivers in
      the town, and went out. Meta sat thoughtful, and, at last, sighing, said, 'I wonder whether
      Bellairs' mother is so very ill? I have a great mind to let Susan try to do my hair, and let
      Bellairs stay a little longer. I never thought of that.'</p>
     <p>'I do not think you will be sorry,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I shall, for if my hair does not look nice, papa will not be pleased, and there is
      aunt Leonora coming. How odd it will be to be without Bellairs! I will ask Mrs. Larpent.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, yes!' said Margaret. 'You must not think we meant to advise; but papa has seen so many
      instances of distress, from servants not spared to their friends in illness, that he feels
      strongly on the subject.'</p>
     <p>'And I really might have been as cruel as that woman!' said Meta. 'Well, I hope Mrs.
      Bellairs may be better, and able to spare her daughter. I don't know what will become of me
      without her.'</p>
     <p>'I think it will have been a satisfaction in one way,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'In what way?'</p>
     <p>'Don't you remember what you began by complaining of, that you could not be of use? Now, I
      fancy this would give you the pleasure of undergoing a little personal inconvenience for the
      good of another.'</p>
     <p>Meta looked half puzzled, half thoughtful, and Margaret, who was a little uneasy at the
      style of counsel she found herself giving, changed the conversation.</p>
     <p>It was a memorable one to little Miss Rivers, opening out to her, as did almost all her
      meetings with that family, a new scope for thought and for duty. The code, to which she had
      been brought
      <pb n="243"/> up, taught that servants were the machines of their employer's convenience.
      Good-nature occasioned much kindliness of manner and intercourse, and every luxury and
      indulgence was afforded freely; but where there was any want of accordance between the
      convenience of the two parties, there was no question. The master must be the first object,
      the servants' remedy was in their own hands.</p>
     <p>Amiable as was Mr. Rivers, this, merely from indulgence and want of reflection, was his
      principle; and his daughter had only been acting on it, though she did not know it, till the
      feelings, that she had never thought of, were thus displayed before her. These were her first
      practical lessons that life was not meant to be passed in pleasing ourselves, and being
      good-natured at small cost.</p>
     <p>It was an effort. Meta was very dependant, never having been encouraged to be otherwise, and
      Bellairs was like a necessary of life in her estimation; but strength of principle came to aid
      her naturally kind-hearted feeling, and she was pleased by the idea of voluntarily undergoing
      a privation, so as to test her sincerity.</p>
     <p>So when her father told her of the inconvenient times of the trains, and declared that
      Bellairs must give it up, she answered, by proposing to let her sleep a night or two there,
      gaily promised to manage very well, and satisfied him.</p>
     <p>Her maid's grateful looks and thanks recompensed her when she made the offer to her, and
      inspirited her to an energetic coaxing of Mrs. Larpent, who, being more fully aware than her
      father, of the needfulness of the lady's maid, and also very anxious that her darling should
      appear to the best advantage before the expected aunt, Lady Leonora Langdale, was unwilling to
      grant more than one night at the utmost.</p>
     <p>Meta carried the day, and her last assurance to Bellairs was, that she might stay as long as
      seemed necessary to make her mother comfortable.</p>
     <p>Thereupon Meta found herself more helpful in some matters than she had expected, but at a
      loss in others. Susan, with all Mrs. Larpent's supervision, could not quite bring her dress to
      the air that was so peculiarly graceful and becoming; and she often caught her papa's eye,
      looking at her as if he saw something amiss, and could not discover what it was. Then came
      aunt Leonora, always very kind to Meta, but the dread of the rest of the household, whom she
      was wont to lecture on the proper care of her niece. Miss Rivers was likely to have a
      considerable fortune, and Lady Leonora intended her to be a very fashionable and much admired
      young lady, under her own immediate protection.</p>
     <p>The two cousins, Leonora and Agatha, talked to her; the one of her balls, the other of her
      music—patronized her, and called her
      <pb n="244"/> their good little cousin—while they criticised the stiff set of those
      unfortunate plaits made by Susan, and laughed, as if it was an unheard-of concession, at
      Bellairs' holiday.</p>
     <p>Nevertheless, when 'Honoured Miss' received a note, begging for three days' longer grace,
      till a niece should come, in whom Bellairs could place full confidence, she took it on herself
      to return free consent. Lady Leonora found out what she had done, and reproved her, telling
      her it was only the way to make 'those people' presume, and Mrs. Larpent was also taken to
      task; but, decidedly, Meta did not regret what she had done, though she felt as if she had
      never before known how to appreciate comfort, when she once more beheld Bellairs stationed at
      her toilette table.</p>
     <p>Meta was asked about her friends. She could not mention anyone but Mrs. Charles Wilmot and
      the Miss Mays.</p>
     <p>'Physician's daughters; oh!' said Lady Leonora.</p>
     <p>And she proceeded to exhort Mr. Rivers to bring his daughter to London, or its
      neighbourhood, where she might have masters, and be in the way of forming intimacies suited to
      her connections.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rivers dreaded London—never was well there, and did not like the trouble of moving—while
      Meta was so attached to the Grange, that she entreated him not to think of leaving it, and
      greatly dreaded her aunt's influence. Lady Leonora did, indeed, allow that the Grange was a
      very pretty place; her only complaint was, the want of suitable society for Meta; she could
      not bear the idea of her growing accustomed—for want of something better—to the Vicar's wife,
      and the pet Doctor's daughters.</p>
     <p>Flora had been long desirous to effect a regular call at Abbotstoke, and it was just now
      that she succeeded. Mrs. Charles Wilmot's little girl was to have a birth-day feast, at which
      Mary, Blanche, and Aubrey were to appear. Flora went in charge of them, and as soon as she had
      safely deposited them, and appointed Mary to keep Aubrey out of mischief, she walked up to the
      Grange, not a whit daunted by the report of the very fine ladies, who were astonishing the
      natives of Abbotstoke.</p>
     <p>She was admitted, and found herself in the drawing-room, with a quick lively-looking lady,
      whom she perceived to be Lady Leonora, and who instantly began talking to her very civilly.
      Flora was never at a loss, and they got on extremely well; her ease and self-possession,
      without forwardness, telling much to her advantage. Meta came in, delighted to see her, but,
      of course, the visit resulted in no really intimate talk, though it was not without effect.
      Flora declared Lady Leonora Langdale to be a most charming person; and Lady Leonora, on her
      side, asked Meta who was that very elegant conversible girl. 'Flora May,' was the delighted
      answer,
      <pb n="245"/> now that the aunt had committed herself by commendation. And she did not retract
      it; she pronounced Flora to be something quite out of the common way, and supposed that she
      had had unusual advantages.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rivers took care to introduce to his sister-in-law, Dr. May, (who would fain have
      avoided it,) but ended by being in his turn pleased and entertained by her brilliant
      conversation, which she put forth for him, as her instinct showed her that she was talking to
      a man of high ability. A perfect gentleman she saw him to be, and making out some mutual
      connections far up in the family tree of the Mackenzies, she decided that the May family were
      an acquisition, and very good companions for her niece at present, while not yet come out.</p>
     <p>So ended the visit, with this great triumph for Meta, who had a strong belief in Aunt
      Leonora's power and infallibility, and yet had not consulted her about Bellairs, nor about the
      school question.</p>
     <p>She had missed one Sunday's school on account of her aunt's visit, but the resolution made
      beside Margaret's sofa had not been forgotten. She spent her Saturday afternoon in a call on
      Mrs. Wilmot, ending with a walk through the village; she confessed her ignorance, apologized
      for her blunders, and put herself under the direction which once she had fancied too strict
      and harsh to be followed.</p>
     <p>And on Sunday, she was content to teach the stupid girls, and abstain from making much of
      the smooth-faced engaging set. She thought it very dull work, but she could feel that it was
      something not done to please herself; and whereas her father had feared she would be dull when
      her cousins were gone, he found her more joyous than ever.</p>
     <p>There certainly was a peculiar happiness about Margaret Rivers; her vexations were but
      ripples, rendering the sunny course of her life more sparkling, and each exertion in the way
      of goodness was productive of so much present joy, that the steps of her ladder seemed,
      indeed, to be of diamonds.</p>
     <p>Her ladder—for she was, indeed, mounting upwards. She was very earnest in her Confirmation
      preparation, most anxious to do right and to contend with her failings; but the struggle at
      present was easy; and the hopes, joys, and incentives, shone out more and more upon her in
      this blithe stage of her life.</p>
     <p>She knew there was a dark side, but hope and love were more present to her than was fear.
      Happy those to whom such young days are granted.</p>

     <p>The holidays had commenced about a week when Harry, now duly appointed to H. M. S.
      Alcestis, was to come home on leave, as he proudly expressed it.</p>
     <p>A glad troop of brothers and sisters, with the Doctor himself, walked up to the station to
      meet him, and who was happiest when, from the window, was thrust out the rosy face, with the
      gold band? Mary gave such a shriek and leap, that two passengers and one guard turned round to
      look at her, to the extreme discomfiture of Flora and Norman, evidenced by one by a grave
      'Mary! Mary!' by the other, by walking off to the extreme end of the platform, and trying to
      look as if he did not belong to them, in which he was imitated by his shadow, Tom.</p>
     <p>Sailor already, rather than school-boy, Harry cared not for spectators; his bound from the
      carriage, and the hug between him and Mary would have been worthy of the return from the
      voyage. The next greeting was for his father, and the sisters had had their share by the time
      the two brothers thought fit to return from their calm walk on the platform.</p>
     <p>Grand was it to see that party return to the town—the naval cadet, with his arm linked in
      Mary's, and Aubrey clinging to his hand, and the others walking behind, admiring him as he
      turned his bright face every moment with some glad question or answer, 'How was Margaret?' Oh,
      so much better; she had been able to walk across the room, with Norman's arm round her—they
      hoped she would soon use crutches—and she sat up more. 'And the baby?' More charming than
      ever—four teeth—would soon walk— such a darling! Then came 'my dirk, the ship, our berth.'
      'Papa, do ask Mr. Ernescliffe to come here. I know he could get leave.'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ernescliffe! You used to call him Alan!' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Yes, but that is all over now. You forget what we do on board. Captain Gordon himself calls
      me Mr. May!'</p>
     <p>Some laughed, others were extremely impressed.</p>
     <pb n="247"/>
     <p>'Ha! There's Ned Anderson coming,' cried Mary. 'Now! Let him see you, Harry.'</p>
     <p>'What matters Ned Anderson to me?' said Harry; and, with an odd mixture of shame-facedness
      and cordiality, he marched full up to his old school-fellow, and shook hands with him, as if
      able, in the plenitude of his officership, to afford plenty of good-humoured superiority. Tom
      had meantime subsided out of all view. But poor Harry's exultation had a fall.</p>
     <p>'Well!' graciously inquired 'Mr. May,' 'and how is Harvey?'</p>
     <p>'O very well. We are expecting him home to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'Where has he been?'</p>
     <p>'To Oxford, about the Randall.'</p>
     <p>Harry gave a disturbed, wondering look round, on seeing Edward's air of malignant
      satisfaction. He saw nothing that reassured him, except the quietness of Norman's own face,
      but even that altered as their eyes met. Before another word could be said, however, the
      Doctor's hand was on Harry's shoulder.</p>
     <p>'You must not keep him now, Ned,' said he—'his sister has not seen him yet.'</p>
     <p>And he moved his little procession onwards, still resting on Harry's shoulder, while a
      silence had fallen on all, and even the young sailor ventured no question. Only Tom's lips
      were quivering, and Ethel had squeezed Norman's hand. 'Poor Harry!' he muttered, 'this is
      worst of all! I wish we had written it to him.'</p>
     <p>'So do I now, but we always trusted it would come right. Oh! if I were but a boy to flog
      that Edward!'</p>
     <p>'Hush, Ethel, remember what we resolved.'</p>
     <p>They were entering their own garden, where, beneath the shade of the tulip-tree, Margaret
      lay on her couch. Her arms were held out, and Harry threw himself upon her, but when he rose
      from her caress, Norman and Tom were gone.</p>
     <p>'What is this?' he now first ventured to ask.</p>
     <p>'Come with me,' said Dr. May, leading the way to his study, where he related the whole
      history of the suspicion that Norman had incurred. He was glad that he had done so in private,
      for Harry's indignation and grief went beyond his expectations; and when at last it appeared
      that Harvey Anderson was actually Randall scholar, after opening his eyes with the utmost
      incredulity, and causing it to be a second time repeated, he gave a gulp or two, turned very
      red, and ended by laying his head on the table, and fairly sobbing and crying aloud, in spite
      of dirk, uniform, and manhood.</p>
     <p>'Harry! why Harry, my boy! We should have prepared you for this,' said the Doctor,
      affectionately. 'We have left off breaking
      <pb n="248"/> our hearts about it. I don't want any comfort now, for having gold instead of
      glitter; though at first I was as bad as you.'</p>
     <p>'O if I had but been there!' said Harry, combating unsuccessfully with his tears.</p>
     <p>'Ah! so we all said, Norman and all. Your word would have cleared him—that is, if you had
      not been in the thick of the mischief. Ha! July, should not you have been on the top of the
      wall?'</p>
     <p>'I would have stood by him, at least. Would not I have given Axworthy and Anderson two such
      black eyes as they could not have shown in school for a week? They had better look out!' cried
      Harry, savagely.</p>
     <p>'What! Ah officer in Her Majesty's service! Eh, Mr. May?'</p>
     <p>'Don't, papa, don't. Oh! I thought it would have been so happy, when I came home, to see
      Norman Randall-scholar. Oh! now I don't care for the ship, nor anything.'</p>
     <p>Again Harry's face went down on the table.</p>
     <p>'Come, come, Harry,' said Dr. May, pulling off the spectacles that had become very dewy,
      'don't let us make fools of ourselves, or they will think we are crying for the
      scholarship.'</p>
     <p>'I don't care for the scholarship, but to have June turned down —and disgrace—'</p>
     <p>'What I care for, Harry, is having June what he is, and <hi>that</hi> I know better
      now.'</p>
     <p>'He is! he is—he is June himself, and no mistake!' cried Harry, with vehemence.</p>
     <p>'The prime of the year, is not it?' said the Doctor, smiling, as he stroked down the blue
      sleeve, as if he thought that generous July did not fall far short of it.</p>
     <p>'That he is!' exclaimed Harry. 'I have never met one fellow like him.'</p>
     <p>'It will be a chance if you ever do,' said Dr. May. 'That is better than scholarships!'</p>
     <p>'It should have been both,' said Harry.</p>
     <p>'Norman thinks the disappointment has been very good for him,' said the Doctor. 'Perhaps it
      made him what he is now. All success is no discipline, you know.'</p>
     <p>Harry looked as if he did not know.</p>
     <p>'Perhaps you will understand better by-and-by, but this I can tell you, Harry, that the
      patient bearing of his vexation, has done more to renew Norman's spirits, than all his
      prosperity. See if it has not. I believe it is harder to everyone of us, than to him. To
      Ethel, especially, it is a struggle to be in charity with the Andersons.'</p>
     <pb n="249"/>
     <p>'In charity!' repeated Harry. 'Papa! you don't want us to like a horrid, sneaking,
      mean-spirited pair like those, that have used Norman in that shameful way?'</p>
     <p>'No, certainly not; I only want you to feel no more personal anger, than if it had been
      Cheviot, or some indifferent person, that had been injured.'</p>
     <p>'I should have hated them all the same!' cried Harry.</p>
     <p>'If it is <hi>all the same</hi> , and it is the treachery you hate, I ask no more,' said the
      Doctor.</p>
     <p>'I cant help it, papa, I can't! If I were to meet those fellows, do you think I could shake
      hands with them? If I did not lick Ned all down Minster-street, he might think himself
      lucky.'</p>
     <p>'Well, Harry, I won't argue any more. I have no right to preach forbearance. Your brother's
      example is better worth than my precept. Shall we go back to Margaret, or have you anything to
      say to me?'</p>
     <p>Harry made no positive answer, but pressed close to his father, who put his arm round him,
      while the curly-head was laid on his shoulder. Presently, he said, with a great sigh, 'There's
      nothing like home.'</p>
     <p>'Was that what you wanted to say?' asked Dr. May, smiling, as he held the boy more closely
      to him.</p>
     <p>'No; but it will be a long time before I come back. They think we shall have orders for the
      Pacific.'</p>
     <p>'You will come home our real lion,' said the Doctor. 'How much you will have to tell!'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Harry; 'but, oh! it is very different from coming home every night, not having
      anyone to tell a thing to.'</p>
     <p>'Do you want to say anything now?'</p>
     <p>'I don't know. I told you in my letter about the half-sovereign.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, never mind that.</p>
     <p>'And there was one night, I am afraid, I did not stand by a little fellow that they bullied
      about his prayers. Perhaps he would have gone on, if I had helped him!'</p>
     <p>'Does he sail with you?'</p>
     <p>'No, he was at school. If I had told him that he and I would stand by each other—but he
      looked so foolish, and began to cry! I am sorry now.'</p>
     <p>'Weak spirits have much to bear,' said the Doctor, 'and you stronger ones, who don't mind
      being bullied, are meant, I suppose, to help them, as Norman has been doing by poor little
      Tommy'</p>
     <p>'It was thinking of Norman—that made me sorry. I knew there was something else, but you see
      I forget, when I don't see you and Margaret every day.'</p>
     <pb n="250"/>
     <p>'You have One always near, my boy.'</p>
     <p>'I know, but I cannot always recollect. And there is such a row at night on board, I cannot
      think or attend as I ought,' murmured Harry.</p>
     <p>'Yes, your life, sleeping at home in quiet, has not prepared you for that trial,' said the
      Doctor. 'But others have kept upright habits under the same, you know—and God helps those who
      are doing their best.'</p>
     <p>Harry sighed.</p>
     <p>'I mean to do my best,' he added; 'and if it was not for feeling bad, I should like it. I
       <hi>do</hi> like it'—and his eye sparkled, and his smile beamed, though the tear was
      undried.</p>
     <p>'I know you do!' said Dr. May, smiling, 'and for feeling bad, my Harry, I fear you must do
      that by sea, or land, as long as you are in this world. God be thanked that you grieve over
      the feeling. But He is ready to aid, and knows the trial, and you will be brought nearer to
      Him, before you leave us.'</p>
     <p>'Margaret wrote about the Confirmation. Am I old enough?'</p>
     <p>'If you wish it, Harry, under these circumstances.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose I do,' said Harry, uneasily twirling a button. 'But then, if I've got to forgive
      the Andersons—'</p>
     <p>'We won't talk any more of that,' said the Doctor—'here is poor Mary, reconnoitring, to know
      why I am keeping you from her.'</p>
     <p>Then began the scampering up and down the house, round and round the garden, visiting every
      pet or haunt, or contrivance; Mary and Harry at the head, Blanche and Tom in full career after
      them, and Aubrey stumping and scrambling at his utmost speed, far behind.</p>
     <p>Not a word passed between Norman and Harry on the school misadventure, but, after the
      outbreak of the latter, he treated it as a thing forgotten, and brought all his high spirits
      to enliven the family party. Richard, too, returned later on the same day, and though not
      received with the same uproarious joy as Harry, the elder section of the family were as happy
      in their way as what Blanche called the middle-aged. The Daisy was brought down, and the
      eleven were again all in the same room, though there were suppressed sighs from some, who
      reflected how long it might be before they could again assemble.</p>
     <p>Tea went off happily in the garden, with much laughing and talking. 'Pity to leave such good
      company!' said the Doctor, unwillingly rising at last—'but I must go to the Union—I promised
      Ward to meet him there.'</p>
     <p>'O let me walk with you!' cried Harry.</p>
     <p>'And me!' cried other voices, and the Doctor proposed that they
      <pb n="251"/> should wait for him in the meads, and extend the walk after the visit. Richard
      and Ethel both expressing their intention of adhering to Margaret—the latter observing bow
      nice it would be to get rid of everybody, and have a talk.</p>
     <p>'What have we been doing all this time?' said Dr. May, laughing.</p>
     <p>'Chattering, not conversing,' said Ethel, saucily.</p>
     <p>'Aye! the Cocksmoor board is going to sit,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'What is a board?' inquired Blanche, who had just come down prepared for her walk.</p>
     <p>'Richard, Margaret, and Ethel, when they sit upon Cocksmoor,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'But Margaret never does sit on Cocksmoor, papa.'</p>
     <p>'Only allegorically, Blanche,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'But I don't understand what is a board?' pursued Blanche.</p>
     <p>'Mr. May in his ship,' was Norman's suggestion.</p>
     <p>Poor Blanche stood in perplexity. 'What is it really?'</p>
     <p>'Something wooden-headed,' continued the provoking papa.</p>
     <p>'A board is all wooden, not only its head,' said Blanche.</p>
     <p>'Exactly so, especially at Stoneborough!' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'It is what papa is when he comes out of the council-room, added Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Or what everyone is while the girls are rigging themselves,' sighed Harry. 'Ha! here's
      Polly—now we only want Flora.'</p>
     <p>'And my stethoscope! Has anyone seen my stethoscope?' exclaimed the Doctor, beginning to
      rush frantically into the study, dining-room, and his own room; but failing, quietly took up a
      book, and gave up the search, which was vigorously pursued by Richard, Flora, and Mary, until
      the missing article was detected, where Aubrey had left it in the nook on the stairs, after
      using it for a trumpet and a telescope.</p>
     <p>'Ah! now my goods will have a chance!' said Dr. May, as he took it, and patted Richard's
      shoulder. 'I have my best righthand, and Margaret will be saved endless sufferings.'</p>
     <p>'Papa!'</p>
     <p>'Aye! poor dear! don't I see what she undergoes, when nobody will remember that useful
      proverb, "A place for everything, and everything in its place." I believe one use of her
      brains is to make an inventory of all the things left about the drawing-room; but, beyond it,
      it is past her power.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Flora, rather aggrieved; 'I do the best I can, but when nobody ever puts
      anything into its place, what can I do, single-handed? So no one ever goes anywhere without
      first turning the house up-side down, for their property; and Aubrey, and now even baby, are
      always carrying whatever they can lay hands on into
      <pb n="252"/> the nursery. I can't bear it; and the worst of it is, that—' she added,
      finishing her lamentation, after the others were out at the door, 'Papa and Ethel have neither
      of them the least shame about it.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, Flora, that is not fair!' exclaimed Margaret—but Flora was gone.</p>
     <p>'I have shame,' sighed Ethel, walking across the room, disconsolately, to put a book into a
      shelf.</p>
     <p>'And you don't leave things <hi>trainants</hi> as you used,' said Margaret. 'That is what I
      meant.'</p>
     <p>'I wish I did not,' said Ethel; 'I was thinking whether I had better not make myself pay a
      forfeit. Suppose you keep a book for me, Margaret, and make a mark against me at everything I
      leave about, and if I pay a farthing for each, it will be so much away from Cocksmoor, so I
      must cure myself!'</p>
     <p>'And what shall become of the forfeits?' asked Richard.</p>
     <p>'Oh, they won't be enough to be worth having, I hope,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Give them to the Ladies' Committee,' said Ethel, making a face.'Oh, Ritchie! they are worse
      than ever. We are so glad that Flora is going to join it, and see whether she can do any
      good.'</p>
     <p>'We?' said Margaret, hesitating.</p>
     <p>'Ah! I know you arn't, but papa said she might—and you know she has so much tact and
      management—'</p>
     <p>'As Norman says,' observed Margaret, doubtfully. 'I cannot like the notion of Flora going
      and squabbling with Mrs. Ledwich and Louisa Anderson!'</p>
     <p>'What do you think, Ritchie?' asked Ethel. 'Is it not too bad that they should have it all
      their own way, and spoil the whole female population? Why, the last thing they did was to
      leave off reading the Prayer-book prayers morning and evening! And it is much expected that
      next they will attack all learning by heart.'</p>
     <p>'It is too bad,' said Richard, 'but Flora can hardly hinder them.'</p>
     <p>'It will be one voice,' said Ethel; 'but oh! if I could only say half what I have in my
      mind, they must see the error. 'Why, these, these—what they call formal—these the ties—links
      on to the Church—on to what is good—if they don't learn them soundly— rammed down hard—you
      know what I mean—so that they can't remember the first—remember when they did not know them—
      they will never get to learn—know—understand when they can understand!'</p>
     <p>'My dear Ethel don't frown so horribly, or it will spoil your eloquence,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I don't understand either,' said Richard, gravely. 'Not understand when they can
      understand? What do you mean?'</p>
     <pb n="253"/>
     <p>'Why, Ritchie, don't you see? If they don't learn them—hard, firm, by rote when they
      can't—they won't understand when they can.'</p>
     <p>'If they don't learn when they can't, they won't understand when they can?'—puzzled
      Richard—making Margaret laugh—but Ethel was too much in earnest for amusement.</p>
     <p>'If they don't learn them by rote when they have strong memories. Yes, that's it!' she
      continued, 'they will not know them well enough to understand them when they are old
      enough!'</p>
     <p>'Who won't learn or understand what?' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Oh! Ritchie, Ritchie! Why the children—the Psalms—the Gospels—the things. They ought to
      know them, love them, grow up to them, before they know the meaning, or they won't care.
      Memory, association, affection, all those come when one is younger than comprehension!'</p>
     <p>'Younger than one's own comprehension?'</p>
     <p>'Richard, you are grown more tiresome than ever. Are you laughing at me?'</p>
     <p>'Indeed, I beg your pardon—I did not mean it,' said Richard. 'I am very sorry to be so
      stupid.'</p>
     <p>'My dear Ritchie, it was only my blundering—never mind.'</p>
     <p>'But what did you mean? I want to know, indeed, Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'I mean that memory and association come before comprehension, so that one ought to know all
      good things—fa—with familiarity before one can understand, because understanding does not make
      one love. Oh! one does that before, and, when the first little gleam, little bit of a sparklet
      of the meaning does come, then it is so valuable and so delightful.'</p>
     <p>'I never heard of a little bit of a sparklet before,' said Richard, 'but I think I do see
      what Ethel means; and it is like what I heard and liked in a University sermon some Sundays
      ago, saying that these lessons and holy words were to be impressed on us here from infancy on
      earth, that we might be always unravelling their meaning, and learn it fully at last—where we
      hope to be.'</p>
     <p>'The very same thought!' exclaimed Margaret, delighted; 'but,' after a pause, 'I am afraid
      the Ladies' Committee might not enter into it in plain English, far less in Ethel's
      language.'</p>
     <p>'Now, Margaret! You know I never meant myself. I never can get the right words for what I
      mean.'</p>
     <p>'And you leave about your <hi>faux commencements</hi> , as M. Ballomprê would call them, for
      us to stumble over,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'But Flora would manage!' said Ethel. 'She has power over people, and can influence them. O
      Ritchie, don't persuade papa out of letting her go.'</p>
     <pb n="254"/>
     <p>'Does Mr. Wilmot wish it?' asked Richard.</p>
     <p>'I have not heard him say, but he was very much vexed about the prayers,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Will he stay here for the holidays?'</p>
     <p>'No, his father has not been well, and he is gone to take his duty. He walked with us to
      Cocksmoor before he went, and we did so wish for you.'</p>
     <p>'How have you been getting on?'</p>
     <p>'Pretty well, on the whole,' said Ethel, 'but, oh dear! oh dear, Richard, the M'Carthys are
      gone!'</p>
     <p>'Gone, where?'</p>
     <p>'Oh, to Wales. I knew nothing of it till they were off. Una and Fergus were missing, and
      Jane Taylor told me they were all gone. Oh, it is so horrid! Una had really come to be so good
      and so much in earnest. She behaved so well at school and Church, that even Mrs. Ledwich liked
      her, and she used to read her Testament half the day, and bring her Sunday-school lessons to
      ask me about! Oh! I was so fond of her, and it really seemed to have done some good with her.
      And now it is all lost! Oh! I wish I knew what would become of my poor child!'</p>
     <p>The only hope is that it may not be all lost,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'With such a woman for a mother!' said Ethel; 'and going to some heathenish place again! If
      I could only have seen her first, and begged her to go to Church and say her prayers. If I
      only knew where she is gone! but I don't. I did think Una would have come to wish me
      good-bye!'</p>
     <p>'I am very sorry to lose her,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Mr. Wilmot says it is bread cast on the waters,' said Margaret—'he was very kind in
      consoling Ethel, who came home quite in despair.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, he said it was one of the trials,' said Ethel, 'and that it might be better for Una as
      well as for me. And I am trying to care for the rest still, but I cannot yet as I did for her.
      There are none of the eyes that look as if they were eating up one's words before they come,
      and that smile of comprehension! Oh! they all are such stupid little dolts, and so
      indifferent!'</p>
     <p>'Why, Ethel!'</p>
     <p>'Fancy last Friday—Mary and I found only eight there—'</p>
     <p>'Do you remember what a broiling day Friday was?' interrupted Margaret. 'Miss Winter and
      Norman both told me I ought not to let them go, and I began to think so when they came home.
      Mary was the colour of a peony!'</p>
     <p>'Oh! it would not have signified if the children had been good for anything, but all their
      mothers were out at work, and, of those that did come, hardly one had learnt their
      lessons—Willy Blake had lost
      <pb n="255"/> his spelling-card—Anne Harris kicked Susan Pope, and would not say she was
      sorry. Mary Hale would not know M from N, do all our Mary would; and Jane Taylor, after all
      the pains I have taken with her, when I asked how the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, seemed
      never to have heard of them.'</p>
     <p>Margaret could have said that Ethel had come in positively crying with vexation, but with no
      diminution of the spirit of perseverance. 'I am so glad you are come, Richard!' she continued.
      'You will put a little new life into them. They all looked so pleased, when we told them Mr.
      Richard was coming.'</p>
     <p>'I hope we shall get on,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'I want you to judge whether the Popes are civilized enough to be dressed for sunday-school.
      Oh! and the money. Here is the account-book—'</p>
     <p>'How neatly you have kept it, Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! it was for you, you know. Receipts—see, ar'n't you surprised?'</p>
     <p>'Four pounds, eighteen and eightpence! That is a great deal!'</p>
     <p>'The three guineas were Mr. Rivers's fees, you know; then, Margaret gave us
      half-a-sovereign, and Mary a shilling, and there was one that we picked up, tumbling about the
      house, and papa said we might have, and the two-pence were little Blanche's savings. Oh,
      Ritchie!' as a bright coin appeared on the book.</p>
     <p>'That is all I could save this term,' he said.</p>
     <p>'Oh! it is famous. Now, I do think I may put another whole sovereign away into the purse for
      the Church. See, here is what we have paid. Shoes—those did bring our money very low, and then
      I bought a piece of print which cost sixteen shillings, but it will make plenty of frocks. So,
      you see, the balance is actually two pounds nine! That is something. The nine shillings will
      go on till we get another fee; for I have two frocks ready made for the Popes, so the two
      pounds are a real nest-egg towards the Church.'</p>
     <p>'The Church!' repeated Richard, half-smiling.</p>
     <p>'I looked in the paper the other day, and saw that a chapel had been built for nine hundred
      pounds,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And you have two!'</p>
     <p>'Two in eight months, Ritchie, and more will come as we get older. I have a scheme in my
      head, but I won't tell you now.'</p>
     <p>Nine hundred! And a Church has to be endowed as well as built, you know, Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! never mind that now. If we can begin and build, some good person will come and help.
      I'll run and fetch it, Ritchie. I drew out a sketch of what I want it to be.'</p>
     <p>'What a girl that is!' said Richard, as Ethel dashed away.</p>
     <pb n="256"/>
     <p>'Is not she?' said Margaret. 'And she means all so heartily. Do you know she has spent
      nothing on her own pleasures, not a book, not a thing has she bought this year, except a
      present for Blanche's birthday, and some silk to net a purse for Harry.'</p>
     <p>'I cannot help being sometimes persuaded that she will succeed,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Faith, energy, selfdenial, perseverance, they go a great way,' said Margaret. 'And yet when
      we look at poor dear Ethel, and her queer ungainly ways, and think of her building a
      Church!'</p>
     <p>Neither Richard nor Margaret could help laughing, but they checked it at once, and the
      former said, 'That brave spirit is a reproof to us all.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret; 'and so is the resolution to mend her little faults.'</p>
     <p>Ethel came back, having, of course, mislaid her sketch, and, much vexed, wished to know if
      it ought to cause her first forfeit, but Margaret thought these should not begin till the date
      of the agreement, and the three resumed the Cocksmoor discussion.</p>
     <p>It lasted till the return of the walking party, so late, that they had been star-gazing, and
      came in, in full dispute as to which was Cygnus and which Aquila, while Blanche was talking
      very grandly of Taurus Poniatouski, and Harry begging to be told which constellations he
      should still see in the southern hemisphere. Dr. May was the first to rectify the globe for
      the southern latitudes, and fingers were affectionately laid on Orion's studded belt, as
      though he were a friend who would accompany the sailor-boy. Voices grew loud and eager in
      enumerating the stars common to both; and so come bed-time, and the globe stood on the table
      in danger of being forgotten. Ethel diligently lifted it up; and while Norman exclaimed at her
      tidiness, Margaret told how a new leaf was to be turned, and of her voluntary forfeits.</p>
     <p>'A very good plan,' cried the Doctor. 'We can't do better than follow her example.'</p>
     <p>'What you, papa? Oh! what fun!' exclaimed Harry.</p>
     <p>'So you think I shall be ruined, Mr. Monkey. How do you know I shall not be the most orderly
      of all? A penny for everything left about, confiscated for the benefit of Cocksmoor, eh?'</p>
     <p>'And twopence for pocket-handkerchiefs, if you please,' said Norman, with a gesture of
      disgust.</p>
     <p>'Very well. From Blanche, upwards. Margaret shall have a book, and set down marks against
      us—hold an audit every Saturday night. What say you, Blanche?'</p>
     <p>'O I hope Flora will leave something about!' cried Blanche, dancing with glee.</p>

      <l>'O no, we never mention her,</l>
      <l>   We never breathe her name.'—</l><p><hi>Song.</hi></p></quote>
     <p>A great deal of merriment had come home with Harry, who never was grave for ten
      minutes without a strong reaction, and distracted the house with his noise and his antics, in
      proportion, as it sometimes seemed, to the spaces of serious thought and reading spent in the
      study, where Dr. May did his best to supply Mr. Ramsden's insufficient attention to his
      Confirmation candidates, by giving an hour every day to Norman, Ethel, and Harry. He could not
      lecture, but he read with them, and his own earnestness was very impressive.</p>
     <p>The two eldest felt deeply, but Harry often kept it in doubt, whether he were not as yet too
      young and wild for permanent impressions, so rapid were his transitions, and so overpowering
      his high spirits. Not that these were objected to; but there was a feeling that there might as
      well be moderation in all things, and that it would have been satisfactory if, under present
      circumstances, he had been somewhat more subdued and diligent.</p>
     <p>'There are your decimals not done yet, Harry.'</p>
     <p>For Harry being somewhat deficient in arithmetic, had been recommended to work in that line
      during his visit at home—an operation usually deferred, as at present, to the evening.</p>
     <p>'I am going to do my sums now, Flora,' said Harry, somewhat annoyed.</p>
     <p>He really fetched his arithmetic, and his voice was soon heard asking how he was ever to put
      an end to a sum that <hi>would</hi> turn to nothing but everlasting threes.</p>
     <p>'What have you been doing, young ladies?' asked Dr. May. 'Did you call on Miss
      Walkingham?'</p>
     <p>'Flora and Blanche did,' said Ethel; 'I thought you did not want me to go, and I had not
      time. Besides, a London grand young lady—Oh!' and Ethel shook her head in disgust.</p>
     <p>'That is not the way you treat Meta Rivers.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Meta is different. She has never been out!'</p>
     <p>'I should have been glad for you to have seen Miss Walkingham,' said her father. 'Pretty
      manners are improving; besides, old Lady Walkingham begged me to send my daughters.'</p>
     <pb n="258"/>
     <p>'I should not have seen her,' said Ethel, 'for she was not well enough to let us in.'</p>
     <p>'Was it not pushing?' said Flora. 'There were the Andersons leaving their card!'</p>
     <p>'Those Andersons!' exclaimed the Doctor; 'I am sick of the very sound of the name. As sure
      as my name is Dick May, I'll include it in Margaret's book of fines.'</p>
     <p>Flora looked dignified.</p>
     <p>'They are always harping on that little trumpery girl's nonsense,' said Harry—'Aught, aught,
      eight, that is eight thousandths, eh, Norman! If it was about those two fellows, the
      boys—'</p>
     <p>'You would harp only on what affects you?' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'No, I don't; men never do. That is one hundred and twenty-fifth.'</p>
     <p>'One man does it to an hundred and twenty-five women?' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'It is rather a female defect, indeed,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Defect!' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Dr. May, 'since it is not only irksome to the hearers, but leads to the breaking
      of the ninth commandment.'</p>
     <p>Many voices declared, in forms of varying severity, that it was impossible to speak worse of
      the Andersons than they deserved.</p>
     <p>'Andersons again!' cried Dr. May, 'One, two, three, four, five, six forfeits!'</p>
     <p>'Papa himself, for he said the name,' saucily put in Blanche.</p>
     <p>'I think I should like the rule to be made in earnest,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'What! in order to catch Flora's pence for Cocksmoor?' suggested Harry.</p>
     <p>'No, but because it is malice. I mean, that is, if there is dislike, or a grudge in our
      hearts at them—talking for ever of nasty little miserable irritations makes it worse.'</p>
     <p>'Then why do you do it?' asked Flora. 'I heard you only on Sunday declaiming about Fanny
      Anderson.'</p>
     <p>'Ha!' cried out all at once. 'There goes Flora!'</p>
     <p>She looked intensely serious and innocent.</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Ethel. 'It is the very reason I want the rule to be made, just to stop us,
      for I am sure we must often say more than is right.'</p>
     <p>'Especially when we come to the pass of declaring that the ninth commandment <hi>cannot</hi>
      be broken with regard to them,' observed the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'Most likely they are saying much the same of us,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Or worse,' rejoined Dr. May. 'The injured never hates as much as the injurer.'</p>
     <pb n="259"/>
     <p>'Now papa has said the severest thing of all!' whispered Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Proving the inexpedience of personalities,' said Dr. May, 'and in good time enter the
      evening post.—Why! how now, Mr. May, are you gone mad?'</p>
     <p>'Hallo! why ho, ha! hurrah!' and up went Harry's book of decimals to the ceiling, coming
      down upon a candle, which would have been overturned on Ethel's work, if it had not been
      dexterously caught by Richard.</p>
     <p>'Harry!' indignantly cried Ethel and Flora, 'see what you have done;' and the Doctor's voice
      called to order, but Harry could not heed. 'Hear! hear! he has a fortune, an estate.'</p>
     <p>'Who? Tell us—don't be so absurd. Who?'</p>
     <p>'Why, Mr. Ernescliffe. Here is a letter from Hector. Only listen:</p>
     <p>'"Did you know we had an old far-away English cousin, one Mr. Halliday? I hardly did, though
      Alan was named after him, and he belonged to my mother. He was a cross old fellow, and took no
      notice of us, but within the last year or two, his nephew, or son, or something, died, and now
      he is just dead, and the lawyer wrote to tell Alan he is heir-at-law. Mr. Ernescliffe of
      Maplewood! Does it not sound well? It is a beautiful great place in Shropshire, and Alan and I
      mean to run off to see it as soon as he can have any time on shore."'</p>
     <p>Ethel could not help looking at Margaret, but was ashamed of her impertinence, and coloured
      violently, whereas her sister did not colour at all, and Norman, looking down, wondered
      whether Alan would make the voyage.</p>
     <p>'Oh! of course he will; he must,' said Harry. 'He would never give up now.'</p>
     <p>Norman further wondered whether Hector would remain on the Stoneborough foundation, and Mary
      hoped they should not lose him; but there was no great readiness to talk over the event, and
      there soon was a silence broken by Flora saying, 'He is no such nobody, as Louisa Anderson
      said, when we—'</p>
     <p>Another shout, which caused Flora to take refuge in playing waltzes for the rest of the
      evening. Moreover, to the extreme satisfaction of Mary, she left her crochet-needle on the
      floor at night. While a tumultuous party were pursuing her with it to claim the penny, and
      Richard was conveying Margaret up-stairs, Ethel found an opportunity of asking her father if
      he were not very glad of Mr. Ernescliffe's good fortune.</p>
     <p>'Yes, very. He is a good fellow, and will make a good use of it.'</p>
     <p>'And now, papa, does it not make—you won't say <hi>now</hi> you are sorry he came here.'</p>
     <pb n="260"/>
     <p>She had no answer but a sigh, and a look that made her blush for having ventured so far. She
      was so much persuaded that great events must ensue, that, all the next day, she listened to
      every ring of the bell, and when one at last was followed by a light, though, to her ears,
      manly sounding tread, she looked up flushing with expectation.</p>
     <p>Behold, she was disappointed. 'Miss Walkingham' was announced, and she rose surprised, for
      the lady in question had only come to Stoneborough for a couple of days with an infirm mother,
      who, having known Dr. May in old times, had made it her especial request that he would let her
      see his daughters. She was to proceed on her journey to-day, and the return of the visit had
      been by no means expected.</p>
     <p>Flora went forward to receive her, wondering to see her so young looking, and so unformed.
      She held out her hand, with a red wrist, and, as far as could be seen under her veil, coloured
      when presented to the recumbent Margaret. How she got into her chair, they hardly knew, for
      Flora was at that moment extremely annoyed by hearing an ill-bred peal of Mary's laughter in
      the garden, close to the window; but she thought it best to appear unconscious, since she had
      no power to stop it.</p>
     <p>Margaret thought the stranger embarrassed, and kindly inquired for Lady Walkingham.</p>
     <p>'Much the same, thank you,' mumbled a voice down in the throat.</p>
     <p>A silence, until Margaret tried another question, equally briefly answered; and, after a
      short interval, the young lady contrived to make her exit, with the same amount of gaucherie
      as had marked her entrance.</p>
     <p>Expressions of surprise at once began, and were so loud, that when Harry entered the room,
      his inquiry was, 'What's the row?'</p>
     <p>'Miss Walkingham,' said Ethel, 'but you won't understand. She seemed half wild! Worse than
      me!'</p>
     <p>'How did you like the pretty improving manners?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'Manners! she had none,' said Flora. 'She, highly connected! used to the best society!'</p>
     <p>'How do you know what the best society do?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'The poor thing seemed very shy,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I don't know about shyness,' said Flora. 'She was stifling a laugh all the time, like a
      rude school-boy. And I thought papa said she was pretty!'</p>
     <p>'Aye? Did you think her so?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'A great broad red face—and so awkward!' cried Flora, indignantly.</p>
     <p>'If one could have seen her face, I think she might have been
      <pb n="261"/> nice-looking,' said Margaret. 'She had pretty golden curls, and merry blue eyes,
      rather like Harry's.'</p>
     <p>'Umph!' said Flora—'beauty and manners seemed to me much on a par! This is one of papa's
      swans, indeed!'</p>
     <p>'I can't believe it was Miss Walkingham at all!' said Ethel. 'It must have been some boy in
      disguise.'</p>
     <p>'Dear me!' cried Margaret, starting with the painful timidity of helplessness. 'Do look
      whether anything is gone. Where's the silver inkstand?'</p>
     <p>'You don't think she could put that into her pocket,' said Ethel, laughing as she held it
      up.</p>
     <p>'I don't know. Do, Harry, see if the umbrellas are safe in the hall. I wish you would, for
      now I come to remember, the Walkinghams went at nine this morning. Miss Winter said that she
      saw the old lady helped into the carriage, as she passed.' Margaret's eyes looked quite large
      and terrified. 'She must have been a spy —the whole gang will come at night! I wish Richard
      was here. Harry, it really is no laughing matter. You had better give notice to the
      police.'</p>
     <p>The more Margaret was alarmed, the more Harry laughed. 'Never mind, Margaret, I'll take care
      of you! Here's my dirk. I'll stick all the robbers.'</p>
     <p>'Harry! Harry! Oh! don't!' cried Margaret, raising herself up in an agony of nervous terror.
      'Oh! where is papa? Will nobody ring the bell, and send George for the police?'</p>
     <p>'Police, police! Thieves! Murder! Robbers! Fire! All hands ahoy!' shouted Harry, his hands
      making a trumpet over his mouth.</p>
     <p>'Harry! how can you?' said Ethel, hastily; 'don't you see that Margaret is terribly
      frightened. Can't you say at once that it was you?'</p>
     <p>'You!' and Margaret sank back, as there was a general outcry of laughter and wonder.</p>
     <p>'Did you know it, Ethel?' asked Flora, severely.</p>
     <p>'I only guessed it this moment,' said Ethel. 'How well you did it, Harry!'</p>
     <p>'Well!' said Flora, 'I did think her dress very like Margaret's shot silk. I hope you did
      not do that any harm.'</p>
     <p>'But how did you manage?' said Ethel. 'Where did your bonnet come from?'</p>
     <p>'It was a new one of Adams' wife. Mary got it for me. Come in, Polly, they have found it
      out. Did you not hear her splitting with laughing outside the window? I would not let her come
      in for fear she should spoil all.'</p>
     <p>'And I was just going to give her such a scolding for giggling in
      <pb n="262"/> the garden,' said Flora, 'and to say we had been as bad as Miss Walkingham. You
      should not have been so awkward, Harry; you nearly betrayed yourself.'</p>
     <p>'He had nobody to teach him but Mary,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Ah! you should have seen me at my ease in Minster Street. No one suspected me there.'</p>
     <p>'In Minster Street. Oh! Harry! you don't really mean it.'</p>
     <p>'I do. That was what I did it for. I was resolved to know what the nameless ones said of the
      Miss Mays.'</p>
     <p>Hasty and eager inquiries broke out from Flora and Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Oh, Dr. May was very clever, certainly, very clever. Had I seen the daughters? I said I was
      going to call there, and they said—'</p>
     <p>'What, oh, what, Harry?'</p>
     <p>'They said Flora was thought pretty, but—and as to Ethel, now, how do you think you came
      off, Unready?'</p>
     <p>'Tell me. They could not say the same of me, at any rate.'</p>
     <p>'Quite the reverse! They called Ethel very odd, poor girl.'</p>
     <p>'I don't mind,' said Ethel. 'They may say what they please of me; besides that, I believe it
      is all Harry's own invention.'</p>
     <p>'Nay, that is a libel on my invention!' exclaimed Harry. 'If I had drawn on that, could I
      not have told you something much droller?'</p>
     <p>'And was that really all?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'They said—let me see—that all our noses were too long, and, that as to Flora's being a
      beauty! when their brothers called her—so droll of them—but Harvey called her a stuck-up
      duchess. In fact, it was the fashion to make a great deal of those Mays.'</p>
     <p>'I hope they said something of the sailor brother,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'No; I found if I stayed to hear much more, I should be knocking Ned down, so I thought it
      time to take leave before he suspected.'</p>
     <p>All this had passed very quickly, with much laughter, and numerous interjections of
      amusement, and reprobation, or delight. So excited were the young people, that they did not
      perceive a step on the gravel, till Dr. May entered by the window, and stood among them. His
      first exclamation was of consternation. 'Margaret! my dear child, what is the matter?'</p>
     <p>Only then did her brother and sisters perceive that Margaret was lying back on her cushions,
      very pale, and panting for breath. She tried to smile and say, 'it was nothing,' and 'she was
      silly,' but the words were faint, from the palpitation of her heart.</p>
     <p>'It was Harry's trick,' said Flora, indignantly, as she flew for the scent-bottle, while her
      father bent over Margaret. 'Harry dressed himself up, and she was frightened.'</p>
     <pb n="263"/>
     <p>'O no—no—he did not mean it,' gasped Margaret—'don't.'</p>
     <p>'Harry! I did not think you could be so cowardly and unfeeling!' and Dr. May's look was even
      more reproachful than his words.</p>
     <p>Harry was dismayed at his sister's condition, but the injustice of the wholesale reproach
      chased away contrition. 'I did nothing to frighten anyone,' he said, moodily.</p>
     <p>'Now, Harry, you know how you kept on,' said Flora, 'and when you saw she was
      frightened—'</p>
     <p>'I can have no more of this,' said Dr. May, seeing that the discussion was injuring Margaret
      more and more. 'Go away to my study, sir, and wait till I come to you! All of you out of the
      room —Flora, fetch the sal volatile.'</p>
     <p>'Let me tell you,' whispered Margaret. 'Don't be angry with Harry. It was—'</p>
     <p>'Not now, not now, my dear. Lie quite still.'</p>
     <p>She obeyed, took the sal volatile, and shut her eyes, while he sat leaning anxiously over,
      watching her. Presently, she opened them, and, looking up, said rather faintly, and trying to
      smile, 'I don't think I can be better till you have heard the rights of it. He did not mean
      it.'</p>
     <p>'Boys never do mean it,' was the Doctor's answer. 'I hoped better things of Harry.'</p>
     <p>'He had no intention,' began Margaret, but she still was unfit to talk, and her father
      silenced her, by promising to go and hear the boy's own account.</p>
     <p>In the hall, he was instantly beset by Ethel and Mary, the former exclaiming, 'Papa! you are
      quite mistaken. It was very foolish of Margaret to be so frightened! He did nothing at all to
      frighten anyone.'</p>
     <p>Ethel's mode of pleading was unfortunate; the 'very foolish of Margaret' were the very words
      to displease.</p>
     <p>'Do not interfere!' said her father, sternly. 'You only encourage him in his wanton
      mischief, and no one takes any heed how he torments my poor Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'Papa!' cried Harry, passionately bursting open the study door, 'tormenting Margaret was the
      last thing I would do.'</p>
     <p>'That is not the way to speak, Harry. What have you been doing?'</p>
     <p>With rapid agitated utterance, Harry made his confession. At another time the Doctor would
      have treated the matter as a joke carried too far, but which, while it called for censure, was
      very amusing; but now the explanation that the disguise had been assumed to impose on the
      Andersons, only added to his displeasure.</p>
     <p>'You seem to think you have a license to play off any impertinent
      <pb n="264"/> freaks you please, without consideration for anyone,' he said; 'but I tell you
      it is not so. As long as you are under my roof, you shall feel my authority, and you shall
      spend the rest of the day in your room. I hope quietness there will bring you to a better
      mind, but I am disappointed in you. A boy who can choose such a time, and such subjects, for
      insolent, unfeeling, practical jokes, cannot be in a fit state for Confirmation.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa! papa!' cried the two girls, in tones of entreaty— while Harry, with a burning
      face and hasty step, dashed up-stairs without a word.</p>
     <p>'You have been as bad!' said Dr. May. 'I say nothing to you, Mary, you knew no better; but,
      to see you, Ethel, first encouraging him in his impertinence, and terrifying Margaret so, that
      I dare say she may be a week getting over it, and now defending him, and calling her silly, is
      unbearable. I cannot trust one of you!'</p>
     <p>'Only listen, papa!'</p>
     <p>'I will have no altercation; I must go back to Margaret, since no one else has the slightest
      consideration for her.'</p>
     <p>An hour had passed away, when Richard knocked at Ethel's door to tell her that tea was
      ready.</p>
     <p>'I have a great mind not to go down,' said Ethel, as he looked in, and saw her seated with a
      book.</p>
     <p>'What do you mean?'</p>
     <p>'I cannot bear to go down while poor Harry is so unjustly used.'</p>
     <p>'Hush, Ethel!'</p>
     <p>'I cannot hush! Just because Margaret fancies robbers and murderers, and all sorts of
      nonsense, as she always did, is poor Harry to be accused of wantonly terrifying her, and shut
      up, and cut off from Confirmation? and just when he is going away, too! It is unkind, and
      unjust, and—'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, you will be sorry—'</p>
     <p>'Papa will be sorry,' continued Ethel, disregarding the caution. 'It is very unfair, and I
       <hi>will</hi> say so. It was all nonsense of Margaret's, but he will always make everything
      give way to her! And poor Harry, just going to sea. No, Ritchie, I cannot come down; I cannot
      behave as usual.'</p>
     <p>'You will grieve Margaret much more,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'I can't help that—she should not have made such a fuss.'</p>
     <p>Richard was somewhat in difficulties how to answer, but at that moment Harry's door, which
      was next, was slightly opened—and his voice said, 'Go down, Ethel. The Captain may punish
      anyone he pleases, and it is mutiny in the rest of the crew to take his part.'</p>
     <p>'Harry is in the right,' said Richard. 'It is our duty not to
      <pb n="265"/> question our father's judgments. It would be wrong of you to stay up.'</p>
     <p>'Wrong?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Of course. It would be against the articles of war,' said Harry, opening his door another
      inch. 'But, Ritchie, I say, do tell me whether it has hurt Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'She is better now,' said Richard, 'but she has a head-ache, chiefly, I believe, from
      distress at having brought this on you. She is very sorry for her fright.'</p>
     <p>'I had not the least intention of frightening the most fearsome little tender mouse on
      earth,' said Harry.</p>
     <p>'No, indeed!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And at another time it would not have signified,' said Richard; but, you know, Margaret
      always was timid, and now, the not being able to move, and the being out of health, has made
      her nerves weak, so that she cannot help it.'</p>
     <p>'The fault was in our never heeding her when we were so eager to hear Harry's story,' said
      Ethel. 'That was what made the palpitation so bad. But, now papa knows all, does he not
      understand about Harry?'</p>
     <p>'He was obliged to go out as soon as Margaret was better,' said Richard, 'and was scarcely
      come in when I came up.'</p>
     <p>'Go down, Ethel,' repeated Harry. 'Never mind me. Norman told me that sort of joke never
      answered, and I might have minded him.'</p>
     <p>The voice was very much troubled, and it brought back that burning sensation of indignant
      tears to Ethel's eyes.</p>
     <p>'O Harry! you did not deserve to be so punished for it.'</p>
     <p>'That is what you are not to say,' returned Harry. 'I ought not to have played the trick,
      and—and just now too—but I always forget things—'</p>
     <p>The door shut, and they fancied they heard sobs. Ethel groaned, but made no opposition to
      following her brother down to tea. Margaret lay, wan and exhausted, on the sofa—the Doctor
      looked very melancholy and rather stern, and the others were silent. Ethel had began to hope
      for the warm re-action she had so often known after a hasty fit, but it did not readily come;
      Harry was boy instead of girl—the fault and its consequence had been more serious—and the
      anxiety for the future was greater. Besides, he had not fully heard the story; Harry, in his
      incoherent narration, had not excused himself, and Margaret's panic had appeared more as if
      inspired by him, than, as it was, in fact, the work of her fancy.</p>
     <p>Thus the evening passed gloomily away, and it was not till the others had said good night,
      that Dr. May began to talk over the
      <pb n="266"/> affair with his eldest son, who then was able to lay before him the facts of the
      case, as gathered from his sisters. He listened with a manner as though it were a reproof, and
      then said, sadly, 'I am afraid I was in a passion.'</p>
     <p>'It was very wrong in Harry,' said Richard, 'and particularly unlucky it should happen with
      the Andersons.'</p>
     <p>'Very thoughtless,' said the Doctor, 'no more, even as regarded Margaret; but
      thoughtlessness should not have been treated as a crime.'</p>
     <p>'I wish we could see him otherwise,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'He wants—' and there Dr. May stopped short, and, taking up his candle, slowly mounted the
      stairs, and looked into Harry's room. The boy was in bed, but started up on hearing his
      father's step, and exclaimed, 'Papa, I am very sorry! Is Margaret better?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, she is; and I understand now, Harry, that her alarm was an accident. I beg your pardon
      for thinking for a moment that it was otherwise—'</p>
     <p>'No,' interrupted Harry, 'of course I could never mean to frighten her; but I did not leave
      off the moment I saw she was afraid, because it was so very ridiculous, and I did not guess it
      would hurt her.'</p>
     <p>'I see, my honest boy. I do not blame you, for you did not know how much harm a little
      terror does to a person in her helpless state. But, indeed, Harry, though you did not deserve
      such anger as mine was, it is a serious thing that you should be so much set on fun and frolic
      as to forget all considerations, especially at such a time as this. It takes away from much of
      my comfort in sending you into the world; and for higher things—how can I believe you really
      impressed and reverent, if the next minute—'</p>
     <p>'I'm not fit! I'm not fit!' sobbed Harry, hiding his face.</p>
     <p>'Indeed, I hardly know whether it is not so,' said the Doctor. 'You are under the usual age,
      and, though I know you wish to be a good boy, yet I don't feel sure that these wild spirits do
      not carry away everything serious, and whether it is right to bring one so thoughtless
      to—'</p>
     <p>'No, no,' and Harry cried bitterly, and his father was deeply grieved, but no more could
      then be said, and they parted for the night—Dr. May saying, as he went away, 'You understand,
      that it is not as punishment for your trick, if I do not take you to Mr. Ramsden for a ticket,
      but that I cannot be certain whether it is right to bring you to such solemn privileges while
      you do not seem to me to retain steadily any grave or deep feelings. Perhaps your mother would
      have better helped you.'</p>
     <pb n="267"/>
     <p>And Dr. May went away, to mourn over what he viewed as far greater sins than those of his
      son.</p>
     <p>Anger had, indeed, given place to sorrow, and all were grave the next morning, as if each
      had something to be forgiven.</p>
     <p>Margaret, especially, felt guilty of the fears which, perhaps, had not been sufficiently
      combated in her days of health, and now were beyond control, and had occasioned so much pain.
      Ethel grieved over the words she had yesterday spoken in haste of her father and sister; Mary
      knew herself to have been an accomplice in the joke, and Norman blamed himself for not having
      taken the trouble to perceive that Harry had not been talking rhodomontade, when he had
      communicated 'his capital scheme' the previous morning.</p>
     <p>The decision as to the Confirmation was a great grief to all. Flora consoled herself by
      observing that, as he was so young, no one need know it, nor miss him; and Ethel, with a
      trembling, almost sobbing voice, enumerated all Harry's excellencies, his perfect truth, his
      kindness, his generosity, his flashes of intense feeling—declared that nobody ought to be
      Confirmed if he were not, and begged and entreated that Mr. Wilmot might be written to, and
      consulted. She would almost have done so herself, if Richard had not shown her that it would
      be undutiful.</p>
     <p>Harry himself was really subdued. He made no question as to the propriety of the decision,
      but rather felt his own unworthiness, and was completely humbled and downcast. When a note
      came from Mrs. Anderson, saying that she was convinced that it could not have been Dr. May's
      wish that she should be exposed to the indignity of a practical joke, and that a young lady of
      the highest family should have been insulted, no one had spirits to laugh at the terms; and
      when Dr. May said, 'What is to be done?' Harry turned crimson, and was evidently trying to
      utter something.</p>
     <p>'I see nothing for it but for him to ask their pardon,' said Dr. May—and a sound was heard,
      not very articulate, but expressing full assent.</p>
     <p>'That is right,' said the Doctor. 'I'll come with you.'</p>
     <p>'O, thank you!' cried Harry, looking up.</p>
     <p>They set off at once. Mrs. Anderson was neither an unpleasing nor unkind person—her chief
      defect being a blind admiration of her sons and daughters, which gave her, in speaking of
      them, a tone of pretension that she would never have shown on her own account.</p>
     <p>Her displeasure was pacified in a moment by the sight of the confused contrition of the
      culprit, coupled with his father's frank and kindly tone of avowal, that it had been a foolish
      improper frolic, and that he had been much displeased with him for it.</p>
     <p>'Say no more—pray say no more, Dr. May. We all know how
      <pb n="268"/> to overlook a sailor's frolic, and, I am sure, Master Harry's present
      behaviour—but you'll take a bit of luncheon,' and, as something was said of going home to the
      early dinner, 'I am sure you will wait one minute. Master Harry must have a piece of my cake,
      and allow me to drink to his success.'</p>
     <p>Poor Mr. May! to be called Master Harry, and treated to sweet cake! But he saw his father
      thought he ought to endure, and he even said, 'thank you.'</p>
     <p>The cake stuck in his throat, however, when Mrs. Anderson and her daughters opened their
      full course of praise on their dear Harvey, and dearest Edward, telling all the flattering
      things Dr. Hoxton had said of the order into which Harvey had brought the school, and
      insisting on Dr. May's reading the copy of the testimonial that he had carried to Oxford. 'I
      knew you would be kind enough to rejoice,' said Mrs. Anderson, 'and that you would have no—no
      feeling about Mr. Norman; for, of course, at his age, a little matter is nothing, and it must
      be better for the dear boy himself to be a little while under a friend like Harvey, than to
      have authority while so young.'</p>
     <p>'I believe it has done him no harm,' was all that the Doctor could bring himself to say; and
      thinking that he and his son had endured quite enough, he took his leave as soon as Harry had
      convulsively bolted the last mouthful.</p>
     <p>Not a word was spoken all the way home. Harry's own trouble had overpowered even this
      subject of resentment. On Sunday, the notice of the Confirmation was read. It was to take
      place on the following Thursday, and all those who had already given in their names, were to
      come to Mr. Ramsden to apply for their tickets. While this was read, large tear-drops were
      silently falling on poor Harry's book.</p>
     <p>Ethel and Norman walked together in the twilight, in deep lamentation over their brother's
      deprivation, which seemed especially to humble them; 'for,' said Norman, 'I am sure no one can
      be more resolved on doing right than July, and he has got through school better than I
      did.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel; 'if we don't get into his sort of scrape, it is only that we are older,
      not better. I am sure mine are worse, my letting Aubrey be nearly burnt—my neglects.'</p>
     <p>'Papa must be doing right,' said Norman, 'but for July to be turned back when we are taken,
      makes me think of man judging only by outward appearance.'</p>
     <p>'A few outrageous-looking acts of giddiness that are so much grieved over, may not be half
      so bad as the hundreds of wandering thoughts that one forgets, because no one else can see
      them!' said Ethel.</p>
     <pb n="269"/>
     <p>Meanwhile, Harry and Mary were sitting twisted together into a sort of bundle, on the same
      footstool, by Margaret's sofa. Harry had begged of her to hear him say the Catechism once
      more, and Mary had joined with him in the repetition. There was to be only one more Sunday at
      home.</p>
     <p>'And that!' he said, and sighed.</p>
     <p>Margaret knew what he meant, for the Feast was to be spread for those newly admitted to
      share it. She only said a caressing word of affection.</p>
     <p>'I wonder when I shall have another chance,' said Harry. 'If we should get to Australia, or
      New Zealand—but then, perhaps, there would be no Confirmation going on, and I might be worse
      by that time.'</p>
     <p>'O, you must not let that be!'</p>
     <p>'Why, you see, if I can't be good here, with all this going on, what shall I do among those
      fellows, away from all?'</p>
     <p>'You will have one friend!'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ernescliffe! You are always thinking of him, Margaret, but perhaps he may not go, and
      if he should, a lieutenant cannot do much for a midshipman. No, I thought, when I was reading
      with my father, that <hi>somehow</hi> , it might help me to do what <hi>it</hi> called putting
      away childish things—don't you know? I might be able to be stronger and steadier,
       <hi>somehow</hi> . And then, if—if—you know, if I did tumble overboard, or any thing of that
      sort, there is <hi>that</hi> about the —what they will go to next Sunday, being necessary to
      salvation.'</p>
     <p>Harry laid down his head and cried; Margaret could not speak for tears; and Mary was
      incoherently protesting against any notion of his falling overboard.</p>
     <p>'It is <hi>generally</hi> necessary, Harry,' Margaret said, at last—'not in impossible
      cases.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, if it had been impossible, but it was not; if I had not been a mad goose all this
      time, but when a bit of fun gets hold of me, I can't think. And if I am too bad for that, I am
      too bad for—for— and I shall never see mamma again! Margaret, it almost makes me af—afraid to
      sail.'</p>
     <p>'Harry, don't, don't talk so!' sobbed Mary. 'O do come to papa, and let us beg and pray.
      Take hold of my hand, and Margaret will beg too, and when he sees how sorry you are, I am sure
      he will forgive, and let you be Confirmed.' She would have dragged him after her.</p>
     <p>'No, Mary,' said Harry, resisting her. 'It is not that he does not forgive. You don't
      understand. It is what is right. And he cannot help it, or make it right for me, if I am such
      a horrid
      <pb n="270"/> wretch that I can't keep grave thoughts in my head. I might do it again after
      that, just the same.'</p>
     <p>'You have been grave enough of late!' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'this was enough to make me so,' said Harry; 'but even at Church, since I came home, I have
      behaved ill! I kicked Tom, to make him look at old Levitt asleep, and then I went on, because
      he did not like it. I know I am too idle.'</p>
     <p>On the Tuesday, Dr. May had said he would take Norman and Etheldred to Mr. Ramsden. Ethel
      was gravely putting on her walking-dress, when she heard her father's voice calling Harry, and
      she started with a joyful hope.</p>
     <p>There, indeed, when she came down stairs, stood Harry, his cap in his hand, and his face
      serious, but with a look on it that had as much subdued joy, as awe.</p>
     <p>'Dear, dear Harry! you are going with us then?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa wrote to ask what Mr. Wilmot thought, and he said—'</p>
     <p>Harry broke off, as his father advanced, and gave her the letter itself to read. Mr. Wilmot
      answered, that he certainly should not refuse such a boy as Harry, on the proof of such entire
      penitence and deep feeling. Whether to bring him to the further privilege, might be another
      question; but, as far as the Confirmation was concerned, the opinion was decided.</p>
     <p>Norman and Ethel were too happy for words, as they went arm in arm along the street, leaving
      their dear sailor to be leant on by his father.</p>
     <p>Harry's sadness was gone, but he still was guarded and gentle, during the few days that
      followed; he seemed to have learnt thought, and in his gratitude for the privileges he had so
      nearly missed, to rate them more highly than he might otherwise have done. Indeed, the doubt
      for the Sunday gave him a sense of probation.</p>
     <p>The Confirmation day came. Mr. Rivers had asked that his daughter might be with Miss May,
      and Ethel had therefore to be called for in the Abbotstoke carriage, quite contrary to her
      wishes, as she had set her heart on the walk to Church with her father and brothers. Flora
      would not come, for fear of crowding Mr. Rivers, who, with Mrs. Larpent, accompanied his
      darling.</p>
     <p>'O Margaret,' said Flora, after putting her sister into the carriage, 'I wish we had put
      Ethel into a veil! There is Meta all white from head to foot, with such a veil! and Ethel, in
      her little white cap, looks as if she might be Lucy Taylor, only not so pretty.'</p>
     <p>'Mamma thought the best rule was to take the dress that needs
      <pb n="271"/> least attention from ourselves, and will be least noticed,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'There is Fanny Anderson gone by in the fly with a white veil on!' cried Mary, dashing
      in.</p>
     <p>'Then I am glad Ethel has not one,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>Margaret looked annoyed, but she had not found the means of checking Flora without giving
      offence; and she could only call Mary and Blanche to order, beg them to think of what the
      others were doing, and offer to read to them a little tale on Confirmation.</p>
     <p>Flora sat and worked, and Margaret, stealing a glance at her, understood, that, in her quiet
      way, she resented the implied reproof. 'Making the children think me worldly and frivolous!'
      she thought, 'as if Margaret did not know that I think and feel as much as any reasonable
      person!'</p>
     <p>The party came home in due time, and, after one kiss to Margeret, given in silence,
      dispersed, for they could not yet talk of what had passed.</p>
     <p>Only Ethel, as she met Richard on the stairs, said, 'Ritchie, do you know what the Bishop's
      text was? "No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom
      of God."'</p>
     <p>'Yes?' said Richard, interrogatively.</p>
     <p>'I thought it might be a voice to me,' said Ethel; 'besides what it says to all, about our
      Christian course. It seems to tell me not to be out of heart about all those vexations at
      Cocksmoor. Is it not a sort of putting our hand to the plough?'</p>
     <p>Dr. May gave his own history of the Confirmation to Margaret. 'It was a beautiful thing to
      watch,' he said, 'the faces of our own set. Those four were really like a poem. There was
      little Meta in her snowy whiteness, looking like innocence itself, hardly knowing of evil, or
      pain, or struggle, as that soft earnest voice made her vow to be ready for it all, almost as
      unscathed and unconscious of trial, as when they made it for her at her baptism—pretty little
      thing— may she long be as happy. And for our own Ethel, she looked as if she was promising on
      and on, straight into eternity. I heard her "I <hi>do</hi> ," dear child, and it was in such a
      tone as if she meant to be ever <hi>doing</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'And for the boys?'</p>
     <p>'There was Norman grave and steadfast, as if he knew what he was about, and was manfully and
      calmly ready—he might have been a young knight, watching his armour.'</p>
     <p>'And so he is!' said Margaret, softly. 'And poor Harry?'</p>
     <p>The Doctor could hardly command voice to tell her. 'Poor Harry, he was last of all, he
      turned his back and looked into the
      <pb n="272"/> corner of the seat, till all the voices had spoken, and then turned about in
      haste, and the two words came on the end of a sob.'</p>
     <p>'You will not keep him away on Sunday?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Far be it from me. I know not who should come, if he should not.'</p>

     <p>'I could not help it,' said Dr. May—'that little witch—'</p>
     <p>'Meta Rivers? Oh! what, papa?'</p>
     <p>'It seems that Wednesday is her birthday, and nothing will serve her but to eat her dinner
      in the old Roman camp.'</p>
     <p>'And are we to go? O which of us?'</p>
     <p>'Everyone of anything like rational years. Blanche is especially invited.'</p>
     <p>There were transports till it was recollected, that on Thursday morning school would
      recommence, and that on Friday Harry must join his ship.</p>
     <p>However, the Roman camp had long been an object of their desires, and Margaret was glad that
      the last day should have a brilliancy, so she would not hear of anyone remaining to keep her
      company, talked of the profit she should gain by a leisure day, and took ardent interest in
      everyone's preparations and expectations, in Ethel's researches into county histories and
      classical dictionaries, Flora's sketching intentions, Norman's promises of <hi>campanula
       glomerata</hi> , and a secret whispered into her ear by Mary and Harry.</p>
     <p>'Meta's weather,' as they said, when the August sun rose fresh and joyous; and great was the
      unnecessary bustle, and happy confusion, from six o'clock till eleven, when Dr. May, who was
      going to visit patients some way further on the same road, carried off Harry and Mary, to set
      them down at the place.</p>
     <p>The rest were called for by Mr. Rivers's carriage and break. Mrs. Charles Wilmot and her
      little girl were the only additions to the party, and Meta, putting Blanche into the carriage
      to keep
      <pb n="273"/> company with her contemporary, went herself in the break. What a brilliant
      little fairy she was, in her pink summer robes, fluttering like a butterfly, and with the same
      apparent felicity in basking in joy, all gaiety, glee, and light-heartedness in making others
      happy. On they went, through honey-suckled lanes, catching glimpses of sunny fields of corn
      falling before the reaper, and happy knots of harvest folks dining beneath the shelter of
      their sheaves, with the sturdy old green umbrella sheltering them from the sun.</p>
     <p>Snatches of song, peals of laughter, merry nonsense, passed from one to the other; Norman,
      roused into blitheness, found wit, the young ladies found laughter, and Richard's eyes and
      mouth looked very pretty, as they smiled their quiet diversion.</p>
     <p>At last, his face drawn all into one silent laugh, he directed the eyes of the rest to a
      high green mound, rising immediately before them, where stood two little figures, one with a
      spy-glass, intently gazing the opposite way.</p>
     <p>At the same time came the halt, and Norman, bounding out, sprang lightly and nimbly up the
      side of the mound, and, while the spy-glass was yet pointed full at Wales, had hold of a pair
      of stout legs, and with the words, 'Keep a good look out!' had tumbled Mr. May headforemost
      down the grassy slope, with Mary rolling after.</p>
     <p>Harry's first outcry was for his precious glass—his second was, not at his fall, but that
      they should have come from the east, when, by the compass, Stoneborough was north-north-west.
      And then the boys took to tumbling over one another, while Meta frolicked joyously, with Nipen
      after her, up and down the mounds, chased by Mary and Blanche, who were wild with glee.</p>
     <p>By-and-by she joined Ethel, and Norman was summoned to help them to trace out the old lines
      of encampment, ditch, rampart, and gates—happy work on those slopes of fresh turf, embroidered
      with every minute blossom of the moor—thyme, birdsfoot, eyebright, and dwarf purple thistle,
      buzzed and hummed over by busy, blacktailed, yellow-banded dumbledores, the breezy wind
      blowing softly in their faces, and the expanse of country-wooded hill, verdant pasture, amber
      harvest-field, winding river, smoke-canopied town, and brown moor, melting greyly away to the
      mountain heads.</p>
     <p>Now in sun, now in shade, the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old banks, and talked
      wisely of vallum and fossa, of legion and cohort, of Agricola and Suetonius, and discussed the
      delightful probability, that this might have been raised in the war with Caractacus, whence,
      argued Ethel, since Caractacus was certainly Arviragus, it must have been the very spot where
      Imogen met Posthumus again. Was not yonder the very high road to Milford
      <pb n="274"/> Haven, and thus must not 'fair Fidele's grassy tomb' be in the immediate
      neighbourhood?</p>
     <p>Then followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good deal like an ancient
      tomb, where, as Blanche interposed with some of the lore lately caught from Ethel's studies,
      'they used to bury their tears in wheelbarrows,' while Norman observed it was the more
      probable, as fair Fidele never was buried at all.</p>
     <p>The idea of a search enchanted the young ladies. 'It was the right sort of vehicle,
      evidently,' said Norman, looking at Harry, who had been particularly earnest in recommending
      that it should be explored; and Meta declared that if they could but find the least trace, her
      papa would be delighted to go regularly to work, and reveal all the treasures.</p>
     <p>Richard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasure-trove, but he was overruled
      by a chorus of eager voices, and dispossessed of the trowel, which he had brought to dig up
      some down-gentians for the garden. While Norman set to work as pioneer, some skipped about in
      wild ecstasy, and Ethel knelt down to peer into the hole.</p>
     <p>Very soon there was a discovery—an eager outcry—some pottery! Roman vessels—a red thing that
      might have been a lamp, another that might have been a lachrymatory.</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Ethel, 'you know, Norman, I always told you that the children's pots and pans
      in the clay ditch were very like Roman pottery.'</p>
     <p>'Posthumus's patty pan!' said Norman, holding it up. 'No doubt this was the bottle filled
      with the old queen's tears when Cloten was killed.'</p>
     <p>'You see it is very small,' added Harry; 'she could not squeeze out many.'</p>
     <p>'Come now, I do believe you are laughing at it!' said Meta, taking the derided vessels into
      her hands. 'Now, they really are genuine, and very curious things, are not they, Flora?'</p>
     <p>Flora and Ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh, and still more exciting
      discovery—a coin, actually a medal, with the head of an emperor upon it—not a doubt of his
      high nose being Roman. Meta was certain that she knew one exactly like him among her father's
      gems. Ethel was resolved that he should be Claudius, and began decyphering the defaced
      inscription THVRVS. She tried Claudius's whole torrent of names, and, at last, made it into a
      contraction of Tiberius, which highly satisfied her.</p>
     <p>Then Meta, in her turn, read D. V. X., which, as Ethel said, was all she could wish—of
      course it was <hi>dux et imperator</hi> , and Harry muttered into Norman's ear, 'ducks and
      geese!' and then heaved
      <pb n="275"/> a sigh, as he thought of the Dux no longer. 'V. V.,' continued Meta, 'what can
      that mean?'</p>
     <p>'Five, five, of course,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'No, no! I have it, <hi>Venus Victrix</hi> ,' said Ethel, 'the ancestral Venus! Ha! don't
      you see? there she is on the other side, crowning Claudius.'</p>
     <p>'Then there is an E.'</p>
     <p>'Something about Æneas,' suggested Norman, gravely.</p>
     <p>But Ethel was sure that could not be, because there was no dipthong; and a fresh theory was
      just being started, when Blanche's head was thrust in to know what made them all so busy.</p>
     <p>'Why, Ethel, what are you doing with Harry's old medal of the Duke of Wellington?'</p>
     <p>Poor Meta and Ethel, what a downfall! Meta was sure that Norman had known it the whole time,
      and he owned to having guessed it from Harry's importunity for the search. Harry and Mary had
      certainly made good use of their time, and great was the mirth over the trap so cleverly
      set—the more when it was disclosed that Dr. May had been a full participator in the scheme,
      had suggested the addition of the pottery, had helped Harry to some liquid to efface part of
      the most inscription, and had even come up with them to plant the snare in the most plausible
      corner for researches.</p>
     <p>Meta, enchanted with the joke, flew off to try to take in her governess and Mrs. Wilmot,
      whom she found completing their leisurely promenade, and considering where they should spread
      the dinner.</p>
     <p>The sight of those great baskets of good fare was appetizing, and the company soon collected
      on the shady turf, where Richard made himself extremely useful, and the feast was spread
      without any worse mishap than Nipen's running away with half a chicken, of which he was
      robbed, as Tom reported, by a surly looking dog that watched in the outskirts of the camp, and
      caused Tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white marauder.</p>
     <p>Meta 'very immorally,' as Norman told her, comforted Nipen with a large share of her
      sandwiches. Harry armed himself with a stick, and Mary with a stone, and marched off to the
      attack, but saw no signs of the enemy, and had begun to believe him a figment of Tom's
      imagination, when Mary spied him under a bush, lying at the feet of a boy, with whom he was
      sharing the spoil.</p>
     <p>Harry called out rather roughly, 'Hollo! what are you doing there?'</p>
     <p>The boy jumped up, the dog growled, Mary shrank behind her brother, and begged him not to be
      cross to the poor boy, but to come away. Harry repeated his question.</p>
     <pb n="276"/>
     <p>'Please, Sir, Toby brought it to me.'</p>
     <p>'What, is Toby your dog?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, Sir.'</p>
     <p>'Are you so hungry as to eat dog's meat?'</p>
     <p>'I have not had nothing before to-day, Sir.'</p>
     <p>'Why, where do you live? hereabouts?'</p>
     <p>'O no, Sir; I lived with grandmother up in Cheshire, but she is dead now, and father is just
      come home from sea, and he wrote down I was to be sent to him at Portsmouth, to go to sea with
      him.'</p>
     <p>'How do you live? do you beg your way?'</p>
     <p>'No, Sir; father sent up a pound in a letter, only Nanny Brooks said I owed some to her for
      my victuals, and I have not much of it left, and bread comes dear, so when Toby brought me
      this bit of meat, I was glad of it, Sir, but I would not have taken it—'</p>
     <p>The boy was desired to wait while the brother and sister, in breathless excitement, rushed
      back with their story.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Wilmot was at first inclined to fear that the naval part of it had been inspired by
      Harry's uniform, but the examination of Jem Jennings put it beyond a doubt that he spoke
      nothing but the truth; and the choicest delight of the feast was the establishing him and Toby
      behind the barrow, and feeding them with such viands as they had probably never seen
      before.</p>
     <p>The boy could not read writing, but he had his father's letter in his pocket, and Mary
      capered at the delightful coincidence, on finding that Jem Jennings was actually a
      quarter-master on board the Alcestis. It gave a sort of property in the boy, and she almost
      grudged Meta the having been first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey,
      instead of doing it by subscription.</p>
     <p>However, Mary had a consolation, she would offer to take charge of Toby, who, as Harry
      observed, would otherwise have been drowned —he could not be taken on board. To be sure, he
      was a particularly ugly animal, rough, grisly, short-legged, long-backed, and with an apology
      for a tail—but he had a redeeming pair of eyes, and he and Jem lived on terms of such close
      friendship, that he would have been miserable in leaving him to the mercy of Nanny Brooks.</p>
     <p>So, after their meal, Jem and Toby were bidden to wait for Dr. May's coming, and fell asleep
      together on the green bank, while the rest either sketched, or wandered, or botanized. Flora
      acted the grown-up lady with Mrs. Wilmot, and Meta found herself sitting by Ethel, asking her
      a great many questions about Margaret, and her home, and what it could be like to be one of
      such a numerous family. Flora had always turned aside from personal matters, as uninteresting
      to her companion, and, in spite of Meta's admiration, and the mutual wish to be intimate,
      confidence did not spring up
      <pb n="277"/> spontaneously, as it had done with the Doctor, and, in that single hour, with
      Margaret. Blunt as Ethel was, her heartiness of manner gave a sense of real progress in
      friendship. Their Confirmation vows seemed to make a link, and Meta's unfeigned enthusiasm for
      the Doctor was the sure road to Ethel's heart. She was soon telling how glad Margaret was that
      he had been drawn into taking pleasure in to-day's scheme, since, not only were his spirits
      tried by the approach of Harry's departure, but he had, within the last few days, been made
      very sad by reading and answering Aunt Flora's first letter on the news of last October's
      misfortune.</p>
     <p>'My aunt in New Zealand,' explained Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Have you an aunt in New Zealand?' cried Meta. 'I never heard of her!'</p>
     <p>'Did not you? Oh! she does write such charming long letters!'</p>
     <p>'Is she Dr. May's sister?'</p>
     <p>'No; he was an only child. She is dear mamma's sister. I don't remember her, for she went
      out when I was a baby, but Richard and Margaret were so fond of her. They say she used to play
      with them, and tell them stories, and sing Scotch songs to them. Margaret says, the first
      sorrow of her life was Aunt Flora's going away.'</p>
     <p>'Did she live with them?'</p>
     <p>'Yes; after grandpapa died, she came to live with them, but then Mr. Arnott came about. I
      ought not to speak evil of him, for he is my godfather, but we do wish he had not carried off
      Aunt Flora! That letter of hers showed me what a comfort it would be to papa to have her
      here.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps she will come.'</p>
     <p>'No; Uncle Arnott has too much to do. It was a pretty story altogether. He was an officer at
      Edinburgh, and fell in love with Aunt Flora, but my grandfather Mackenzie thought him too poor
      to marry her, and it was all broken off, and they tried to think no more of it. But grandpapa
      died, and she came to live here, and somehow Mr. Arnott turned up again, quartered at
      Whitford, and papa talked over my Uncle Mackenzie, and helped them—and Mr. Arnott thought the
      best way would be to go out to the colonies. They went when New Zealand was very new, and a
      very funny life they had! Once they had their house burnt in Heki's rebellion— and Aunt Flora
      saw a Maori walking about in her best Sunday bonnet—but, in general, everything has gone on
      very well, and he has a great farm, besides an office under government.'</p>
     <p>'Oh; so he went out as a settler; I was in hopes it was as a missionary.'</p>
     <p>'I fancy Aunt Flora has done a good deal that may be called
      <pb n="278"/> missionary work,' said Ethel, 'teaching the Maori women and girls. They call her
      mother, and she has quite a doctor's shop for them, and tries hard to teach them to take
      proper care of their poor little children, when they are ill—and she cuts out clothes for the
      whole pah, that is, the village.'</p>
     <p>'And are they Christians?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! to be sure they are now! They meet in the pah for prayers every morning and
      evening—they used to have a hoe struck against a bit of metal for a signal, and when papa
      heard of it, he gave them a bell, and they were so delighted. Now there comes a Clergyman
      every fourth Sunday, and, on the others, Uncle Arnott reads part of the service to the English
      near, and the Maori teacher to his people.'</p>
     <p>Meta asked ravenously for more details, and when she had pretty well exhausted Ethel's
      stock, she said, 'How nice it must be! Ethel, did you ever read the "Faithful Little
      Girl?"'</p>
     <p>'Yes; it was one of Margaret's old Sunday books. I often recollected it before I was allowed
      to begin Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'I'm afraid I am very like Lucilla!' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'What? In wishing to be a boy, that you might be a Missionary?' said Ethel. 'Not in being
      quite so cross at home?' she added, laughing.</p>
     <p>'I am not cross, because I have no opportunity,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'No opportunity. Oh, Meta! if people wish to be cross, it is easy enough to find grounds for
      it. There is always the moon to cry for.'</p>
     <p>'Really and truly,' said Meta, thoughtfully, 'I never do meet with any reasonable trial of
      temper, and I am often afraid it cannot be right or safe to live so entirely at ease, and
      without contradictions.'</p>
     <p>'Well, but—' said Ethel, 'it is the state of life in which you are placed.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; but are we meant never to have vexations?'</p>
     <p>'I thought you had them,' said Ethel. 'Margaret told me about your maid. That would have
      worried some people, and made them horridly cross.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! no rational person,' cried Meta. 'It was so nice to think of her being with the poor
      mother, and I was quite interested in managing for myself; besides, you know, it was just a
      proof how one learns to be selfish, that it had never occurred to me that I ought to spare
      her.'</p>
     <p>'And your school children—you were in some trouble about them?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! that is pleasure.'</p>
     <p>'I thought you had a class you did not like.'</p>
     <p>'I like them now—they are such steady plodding girls, so much in earnest, and one, that has
      been neglected, is so pleased and
      <pb n="279"/> touched by kindness. I would not give them up for anything now— they are just
      fit for my capacity.'</p>
     <p>'Do you mean that nothing ever goes wrong with you, or that you do not mind
      anything—which?'</p>
     <p>'Nothing goes wrong enough with me to give me a handsome excuse for minding it.'</p>
     <p>'Then it must be all your good temper.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think so,' said Meta—'it is that nothing is ever disagreeable to me.'</p>
     <p>'Stay,' said Ethel, 'if the ill-temper was in you, you would only be the crosser for being
      indulged—at least, so books say. And I am sure myself, that it is not whether things are
      disagreeable or not, but whether one's will is with them, that signifies.'</p>
     <p>'I don't quite understand.'</p>
     <p>'Why—I have seen the boys do for play, and done myself, what would have been a horrid
      hardship if one had been made to do it. I never liked any lessons as well as those I did
      without being obliged, and always, when there is a thing I hate very much in itself, I can get
      up an interest in it, by resolving that I will do it well, or fast, or something—if I
       <hi>can</hi> stick my will to it, it is like a lever, and it is done. Now, I think it must be
      the same with you, only your will is more easily set at it than mine.'</p>
     <p>'What makes me uncomfortable is, that I feel as if I never followed anything but my
      will.'</p>
     <p>Ethel screwed up her face, as if the eyes of her mind were pursuing some thought almost
      beyond her. 'If our will and our duty run the same,' she said, 'that can't be wrong. The
      better people are, the more they "love what He commands," you know. In Heaven they have no
      will but His.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! but Ethel,' cried Meta, distressed, 'that is putting it too high. Won't you understand
      what I mean? We have learnt so much lately about selfdenial, and crossing one's own
      inclinations, and enduring hardness. And here I live with two dear kind people, who only try
      to keep every little annoyance from my path. I can't wish for a thing without getting it—I am
      waited on all day long, and I feel like one of the women that are at ease—one of the careless
      daughters.'</p>
     <p>'I think still papa would say it was your happy contented temper that made you find no
      vexation.'</p>
     <p>'But that sort of temper is not goodness. I was born with it; I never did mind anything, not
      even being punished, they say, unless I knew papa was grieved, which always did make me
      unhappy enough. I laughed, and went to play most saucily, whatever they did to me. If I had
      striven for the temper, it would be worth
      <pb n="280"/> having, but it is my nature. And Ethel,' she added, in a low voice, as the tears
      came into her eyes, 'don't you remember last Sunday? I felt myself so vain and petted a thing!
      as if I had no share in the Cup of suffering, and did not deserve to call myself a member—it
      seemed ungrateful.'</p>
     <p>Ethel felt ashamed, as she heard of warmer feelings than her own had been, expressed in that
      lowered trembling voice, and she sought for the answer that would only come to her mind in
      sense, not at first in words. 'Discipline,' said she, 'would not that show the willingness to
      have the part? Taking the right times for refusing oneself some pleasant thing.'</p>
     <p>'Would not that be only making up something for oneself?' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'No, the Church orders it. It is in the Prayer-book,' said Ethel. 'I mean one can do little
      secret things—not read story-books on those days, or keep some tiresome sort of work for them.
      It is very trumpery, but it keeps the remembrance, and it is not so much as if one did not
      heed.'</p>
     <p>'I'll think,' said Meta, sighing. 'If only I felt myself at work, not to please myself, but
      to be of use. Ha!' she cried, springing up, 'I do believe I see Dr. May coming!'</p>
     <p>'Let us run and meet him,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>They did so, and he called out his wishes of many happy returns of blithe days to the little
      birthday queen, then added, 'You both look grave, though—have they deserted you?'</p>
     <p>'No, papa, we have been having a talk,' said Ethel. 'May I tell him, Meta? I want to know
      what he says.'</p>
     <p>Meta had not bargained for this, but she was very much in earnest, and there was nothing
      formidable in Dr. May, so she assented.</p>
     <p>'Meta is longing to be at work—she thinks she is of no use,' said Ethel—'she says she never
      does anything but please herself.'</p>
     <p>'Pleasing oneself is not the same as trying to please oneself,' said Dr. May, kindly.</p>
     <p>'And she thinks it cannot be safe or right,' added Ethel, 'to live that happy bright life,
      as if people without care or trouble could not be living as Christians are meant to live. Is
      that it, Meta?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I think it is,' said Meta. 'I seem to be only put here to be made much of!'</p>
     <p>'What did David say, Meta?' returned Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Then you think,' said Meta, much touched, 'that I ought to
      <pb n="281"/> look on this as "the pastures fair," and be thankful. I hope I was not
      unthankful.'</p>
     <p>'O, no,' said Ethel. 'It was the wish to bear hardness, and be a good soldier, was it
      not?'</p>
     <p>'Ah! my dear,' he said, 'the rugged path and dark valley will come in His own fit time.
      Depend upon it, the good Shephered is giving you what is best for you in the green meadow, and
      if you lay hold on His rod and staff in your sunny days.—' He stopped short, and turned to his
      daughter.</p>
     <p>'Ethel, they sang that Psalm the first Sunday I brought your mamma home!'</p>
     <p>Meta was much affected, and began to put together what the father and daughter had said.
      Perhaps the little modes of secret discipline, of which Ethel had spoken, might be the true
      means of clasping the staff—perhaps she had been impatient, and wanting in humility in craving
      for the strife, when her armour was scarce put on.</p>
     <p>Dr. May spoke once again. 'Don't let anyone long for external trial. The offering of a free
      heart is the thing. To offer praise is the great object of all creatures in heaven and earth.
      If the happier we are, the more we praise, then all is well.'</p>
     <p>But the serious discussion was suddenly broken off.</p>
     <p>Others had seen Dr. May's approach, and Harry and Mary rushed down in dismay at their story
      having, as they thought, been forestalled. However, they had it all to themselves, and the
      Doctor took up the subject as keenly as could have been hoped, but the poor boy being still
      fast asleep, after, probably, much fatigue, he would not then waken him to examine him, but
      came and sat down in the semicircle, formed by a terraced bank of soft turf, where Mrs.
      Larpent, Mrs. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, had for some time taken up their abode. Meta brought
      him the choice little basket of fruit which she had saved for him, and all delighted in having
      him there, evidently enjoying the rest and sport very much, as he reposed on the fragrant
      slope, eating grapes, and making inquiries as to the antiquities lately discovered.</p>
     <p>Norman gave an exceedingly droll account of the great Roman Emperor, Tiberius V. V., and
      Meta, correcting it, there was a regular gay skirmish of words, which entertained everyone
      extremely —above all, Meta's indignation when the charge was brought home to her of having
      declared the 'old Duke' exactly like in turns to Domitian and Tiberius—his features quite
      forbidding.</p>
     <p>This lasted till the younger ones, who had been playing and rioting till they were tired,
      came up, and throwing themselves down
      <pb n="282"/> on the grass, Blanche petitioned for something that everyone could play at.</p>
     <p>Meta proposed what she called the story play. One was to be sent out of earshot, and the
      rest to agree upon a word, which was then to be guessed by each telling a story, and
      introducing the word into it, not too prominently. Meta volunteered to guess, and Harry
      whispered to Mary it would be no go, but, in the meantime, the word was found, and Blanche
      eagerly recalled Meta, and sat in the utmost expectation and delight. Meta turned first to
      Richard, but he coloured distressfully, and begged that Flora might tell his story for him—he
      should only spoil the game. Flora, with a little tinge of graceful reluctance, obeyed. 'No
      woman had been to the summit of Mont Blanc,' she said, 'till one young girl, named Marie,
      resolved to have this glory. The guides told her it was madness, but she persevered. She took
      the staff, and everything requisite and, following a party, began the ascent. She bravely
      supported every fatigue, climbed each precipice, was undaunted by the giddy heights she
      attained, bravely crossed the fields of snow, supported the bitter cold, and finally, though
      suffering severely, arrived at the topmost peak, looked forth where woman had never looked
      before, felt her heart swell at the attainment of her utmost ambition, and the name of Marie
      was inscribed as that of the woman who alone has had the glory of standing on the summit of
      the Giant of the Alps.'</p>
     <p>It was prettily enunciated, and had a pleasing effect. Meta stood conning the
      words—woman—giant—mountain—glory—and begged for another tale.</p>
     <p>'Mine shall not be so stupid as Flora's,' said Harry. 'We have an old sailor on board the
      Alcestis—a giant he might be for his voice—but he sailed once in the Glory of the West, and
      there they had a monkey that was picked up in Africa, and one day this old fellow found his
      queer messmate, as he called him, spying through a glass, just like the captain. The captain
      had a glorious collection of old coins, and the like, dug up in some of the old Greek
      colonies, and whenever Master Monkey saw him overhauling them, he would get out a brass
      button, or a card or two, and turn 'em over, and chatter at them, and glory over them, quite
      knowing—' said Harry, imitating the gesture, 'and I dare say he saw V. V., and Tiberius Cæsar,
      as well as the best of them.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, Mr. Harry,' said Meta. 'I think we are at no loss for monkeys here. But I have
      not the word yet. Who comes next? Ethel—'</p>
     <p>'I shall blunder, I forewarn you,' said Ethel, 'but this is mine.
      <pb n="283"/> "There was a young king, who had an old tutor, whom he despised because he was
      so strict, so he got rid of him, and took to idle sport. One day, when he was out hunting in a
      forest, a white hind came and ran before him, till she guided him to a castle, and there he
      found a lady, all dressed in white, with a beamy crown on her head, and so nobly beautiful,
      that he fell in love with her at once, and was only sorry to see another prince who was come
      to her palace too. She told them her name was Gloria, and that she had had many suitors, but
      the choice did not depend on herself—she could only be won by him who deserved her, and for
      three years they were to be on their probation, trying for her. So she dismissed them, only
      burning to gain her, and telling them to come back in three years' time. But they had not gone
      far before they saw another palace, much finer, all glittering with gold and silver, and their
      Lady Gloria came out to meet them, not in her white dress, but in one all gay and bright with
      fine colours, and her crown they now saw was of diamonds. She told them they had only seen her
      every-day dress and house, this was her best; and she showed them about the castle, and all
      the pictures of her former lovers. There was Alexander, who had been nearer retaining her than
      anyone, only the fever prevented it; there was Pyrrhus, always seeking her, but slain by a
      tile—Julius Cæsar—Tamerlane—all the rest, and she hoped that one of these two would really
      prove worthy and gain her, by going in the same path as these great people.</p>
     <p>"So our prince went home; his head full of being like Alexander and all the rest of them,
      and he sent for his good old tutor to reckon up his armies, and see whom he could conquer in
      order to win her. But the old tutor told him he was under a mistake; the second lady he had
      seen was a treacherous cousin of Gloria, who drew away her suitors by her deceits, and whose
      real name was Vana Gloria. If he wished to earn the true Gloria, he must set to work to do his
      subjects good, and to be virtuous. And he did; he taught them, and he did justice to them, and
      he bore it patiently and kindly when they did not understand. But by-and-by, the other king,
      who had no good tutor to help him, had got his armies together, and conquered ever so many
      people, and drawn off their men to be soldiers; and now he attacked the good prince, and was
      so strong, that he gained the victory, though both prince and subjects fought manfully with
      heart and hand; but the battle was lost, and the faithful prince wounded and made prisoner,
      but bearing it most patiently, till he was dragged behind the other's triumphal car with all
      the rest, when the three years were up, to be presented to Vana Gloria. And so he was carried
      into the forest, bleeding and wounded, and his enemy drove the car over his body, and
      <pb n="284"/> stretched out his arms to Vana Gloria, and found her a vain, ugly wretch, who
      grew frightful as soon as he grasped her. But the good dying prince saw the beautiful beamy
      face of his lady-love bending over him. "Oh!" he said, "vision of my life, hast thou come to
      lighten my dying eyes? Never—never, even in my best days, did I deem that I could be worthy of
      thee; the more I strove, the more I knew that Gloria is for none below—for me less than
      all."</p>
     <p>'And then the lady came and lifted him up, and she said, "Gloria is given to all who do and
      suffer truly in a good cause, for faithfulness is glory, and that is thine."'</p>
     <p>Ethel's language had become more flowing as she grew more eager in the tale, and they all
      listened with suspended interest. Norman asked where she got the story. 'Out of an old French
      book, the <hi>Magazin des enfans</hi> ,' was the answer.</p>
     <p>'But why did you alter the end?' said Flora, 'why kill the poor man? He used to be
      prosperous, why not?'</p>
     <p>'Because I thought,' said Ethel, 'that glory could not properly belong to anyone here, and
      if he was once conscious of it, it would be all spoilt. Well, Meta do you guess?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! the word! I had forgotten all about it. I think I know what it must be, but I should so
      like another story. May I not have one?' said Meta, coaxingly. 'Mary, it is you.'</p>
     <p>Mary fell back on her papa, and begged him to take hers. Papa told the best stories of all,
      she said, and Meta looked beseeching.</p>
     <p>'My story will not be as long as Ethel's,' said the Doctor. yielding with a half reluctant
      smile. 'My story is of a humming bird, a little creature that loved its master with all its
      strength, and longed to do somewhat for him. It was not satisfied with its lot, because it
      seemed merely a vain and profitless creature. The nightingale sang praise, and the woods
      sounded with the glory of its strains; the fowl was valued for its flesh, the ostrich for its
      plume, but what could the little humming bird do, save rejoice in the glory of the flood of
      sunbeams, and disport itself over the flowers, and glance in the sunny light, as its bright
      breastplate flashed from rich purple to dazzling flame-colour, and its wings supported it,
      fluttering so fast that the eye could hardly trace them, as it darted its slender beak into
      the deep-belled blossoms. So the little bird grieved, and could not rest, for thinking that it
      was useless in this world, that it sought merely its own gratification, and could do nothing
      that could conduce to the glory of its master. But, one night, a voice spoke to the little
      bird, "Why hast thou been placed here," it said, "but at the will of thy master? Was it not
      that he might delight himself in thy radiant plumage, and see thy joy in the sunshine? His
      gifts are thy buoyant wing, thy beauteous colours, the love of all around,
      <pb n="285"/> the sweetness of the honey drop in the flowers, the shade of the palm leaf.
      Esteem them, then, as his; value thine own bliss, while it lasts, as the token of his care and
      love; and while thy heart praises him for them, and thy wings quiver and dance to the tune of
      that praise, then, indeed, thy gladness conduces to no vain-glory of thine own, in beauty, or
      in graceful flight, but thou art a creature serving as best thou canst to his glory.'"</p>
     <p>'I know the word,' half whispered Meta, not without a trembling of the lip. 'I know why you
      told the story, Dr. May, but one is not as good as the humming birds.'</p>
     <p>The elder ladies had begun to look at watches, and talk of time to go home; and Jem Jemmings
      having been seen rearing himself up from behind the barrow, the Doctor proceeded to
      investigate his case, was perfectly satisfied of the boy's truth, and as ready as the young
      ones to befriend him. A letter should be written at once, desiring his father to look out for
      him on Friday, when he should go by the same train as Harry, who was delighted at the notion
      of protecting him so far, and begged to be allowed to drive him home to Stoneborough in the
      gig.</p>
     <p>Consent was given; and Richard being added to give weight and discretion, the gig set out at
      once—the Doctor, much to Meta's delight, took his place in the break. Blanche, who, in the
      morning, had been inclined to despise it as something akin to a cart, now finding it a popular
      conveyance, was urgent to return in it; and Flora was made over to the carriage, not at all
      unwillingly, for, though it separated her from Meta, it made a senior of her.</p>
     <p>Norman's fate conveyed him to the exalted seat beside the driver of the break, where he
      could only now and then catch the sounds of mirth from below. He had enjoyed the day
      exceedingly, with that sort of <hi>abandon</hi> more than ordinarily delicious to grave or
      saddened temperaments, when roused or drawn out for a time. Meta's winning grace and sweetness
      had a peculiar charm for him, and, perhaps, his having been originally introduced to her as
      ill, and in sorrow, had given her manner towards him a sort of kindness which was very
      gratifying.</p>
     <p>And now he felt as if he was going back to a very dusky dusty world; the last and blithest
      day of his holidays was past, and he must return to the misapprehensions and injustice that
      had blighted his school career, be kept beneath boys with half his ability, and without
      generous feeling, and find all his attainments useless in restoring his position. Dr. Hoxton's
      dull scholarship would chill all pleasure in his studies—there would be no companionship among
      the boys—even his supporters, Ernescliffe and Larkins, were gone, and Harry would leave him
      still under a cloud.</p>
     <pb n="286"/>
     <p>Norman felt it more as disgrace than he had done since the first, and wished he had
      consented to quit the school when it had been offered—be made a man, instead of suffering
      these doubly irksome provocations, which rose before him in renewed force. 'And what would
      that little humming bird think of me if she knew me disgraced?' thought he. 'But it is of no
      use to think of it. I must go through with it, and as I always <hi>am</hi> getting
      vain-glorious, I had better have no opportunity. I did not declare I renounced vain-pomp and
      glory last week, to begin coveting them now again.'</p>
     <p>So Norman repressed the sigh as he looked at the school buildings, which never could give
      him the pleasures of memory they afforded to others.</p>
     <p>The break had set out before the carriage, so that Meta had to come in and wait for her
      governess. Before the vehicle had disgorged half its contents, Harry had rushed out to meet
      them. 'Come in! come in, Norman! Only hear. Margaret shall tell you herself! Hurra!'</p>
     <p>Is Mr. Ernescliffe come? crossed Ethel's mind, but Margaret was alone, flushed, and holding
      out her hands. 'Norman! where is he? Dear Norman, here is good news! Papa, Dr. Hoxton has been
      here, and he knows all about it—and oh! Norman, he is very sorry for the injustice, and you
      are Dux again!'</p>
     <p>Norman really trembled so much that he could neither speak nor stand, but sat down on the
      window-seat, while a confusion of tongues asked more.</p>
     <p>Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Larkins had come to call—heard no one was at home but Miss May—had,
      nevertheless, come in—and Margaret had heard that Mr. Larkins, who had before intended to
      remove his son from Stoneborough, had, in the course of the holidays, made discoveries from
      him, which he could not feel justified in concealing from Dr. Hoxton.</p>
     <p>The whole of the transactions with Ballhatchet, and Norman's part in them, had been
      explained, as well as the true history of the affray in Randall's alley—how Norman had
      dispersed the boys, how they had again collected, and, with the full concurrence of Harvey
      Anderson, renewed the mischief, how the Andersons had refused to bear witness in his favour,
      and how Ballhatchet's ill-will had kept back the evidence which would have cleared him.</p>
     <p>Little Larkins had told all, and his father had no scruple in repeating it, and causing the
      investigation to be set on foot. Nay, he deemed that Norman's influence had saved his son, and
      came as anxious to thank him, as Dr. Hoxton, warm-hearted, though injudicious, was to repair
      his injustice, They were much surprised and struck by finding that Dr. May had been aware of
      the truth the whole
      <pb n="287"/> time, and had patiently put up with the injustice, and the loss of the
      scholarship—a loss which Dr. Hoxton would have given anything to repair, so as to have sent up
      a scholar likely to do him so much credit; but it was now too late, and he had only been able
      to tell Margaret how dismayed he was at finding out that the boy to whom all the good order in
      his school was owing, had been so ill-used. Kind Dr. May's first feeling really seemed to be
      pity and sympathy for his old friend, the head master, in the shock of such a discovery. Harry
      was vociferously telling his version of the story to Ethel and Mary. Tom stood transfixed in
      attention. Meta, forgotten and bewildered, was standing near Norman, whose colour rapidly
      varied, and whose breath came short and quick as he listened. A quick half interrogation
      passed Meta's lips, heard by no one else.</p>
     <p>'It is only that it is all right,' he answered, scarcely audibly; 'they have found out the
      truth.'</p>
     <p>'What—who—you?' said Meta, as she heard words that implied the past suspicion.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman, 'I was suspected, but never at home.'</p>
     <p>'And is it over now?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, yes,' he whispered huskily, 'all is right, and Harry will not leave me in
      disgrace.'</p>
     <p>Meta did not speak, but she held out her hand in hearty congratulation; Norman, scarce
      knowing what he did, grasped and wrung it so tight, that it was positive pain, as he turned
      away his head to the window to struggle with those irrepressible tears. Meta's colour flushed
      into her cheek as she found it still held, almost unconsciously perhaps, in his agitation, and
      she heard Margaret's words, that both gentlemen had said Norman had acted nobly, and that
      every revelation made in the course of their examination, had only more fully established his
      admirable conduct.</p>
     <p>'O Norman! Norman, I am so glad!' cried Mary's voice in the first pause, and, Margaret
      asking where he was, he suddenly turned round, recollected himself, and found it was not the
      back of the chair that he had been squeezing, blushed intensely, but made no attempt at
      apology, for indeed he could not speak—he only leant down over Margaret, to receive her
      heartfelt embrace; and, as he stood up again, his father laid his hand on his shoulder, 'My
      boy, I am glad—' but the words were broken, and, as if neither could bear more, Norman hastily
      left the room, Ethel rushing after him.</p>
     <p>'Quite overcome!' said the Doctor, 'and no wonder. He felt it cruelly, though he bore up
      gallantly. Well, July.'</p>
     <p>'I'll go down to school with him to-morrow, and see him Dux again! I'll have
      three-times-three!' shouted Harry, 'hip! hip! hurra!' and Tom and Mary Joined in chorus.</p>
     <pb n="288"/>
     <p>'What is all this?' exclaimed Flora, opening the door—is everyone gone mad?'</p>
     <p>Many were the voices that answered.</p>
     <p>'Well! I am glad, and I hope the Andersons will make an apology. But where is poor Meta?
      Quite forgotten?'</p>
     <p>'Meta would not wonder if she knew all,' said the Doctor, turning, with a sweet smile that
      had in it something nevertheless of apology.</p>
     <p>'Oh! I am so glad—so glad!' said Meta, her eyes full of tears, as she came forward.</p>
     <p>And there was no helping it; the first kiss between Margaret May, and Margaret Rivers, was
      given in that overflowing sympathy of congratulation.</p>
     <p>The Doctor gave her his arm to take her to the carriage, and, on the way, his quick warm
      words filled up the sketch of Norman's behaviour; Meta's eyes responded better than her
      tongue, but, to her good-bye, she could not help adding, 'Now I <hi>have</hi> seen true
      glory.'</p>
     <p>His answer was much such a gripe as her poor little fingers had already received, but though
      they felt hot and crushed, all the way home, the sensation seemed to cause such throbs of joy,
      that she would not have been without it.</p>

     <p>Harry's last home morning was brightened by going to the school to see full justice
      done to Norman, and enjoying the scene for him. It was indeed a painful ordeal to Norman
      himself, who could, at the moment, scarcely feel pleasure in his restoration, excepting for
      the
      <pb n="289"/> sake of his father, Harry, and his sisters. To find the head master making
      apologies to him, was positively painful and embarrassing, and his countenance would have been
      fitter for a culprit receiving a lecture. It was pleasanter when the two other masters shook
      hands with him, Mr. Harrison with a free confession that he had done him injustice, and Mr.
      Wilmot with a glad look of congratulation, that convinced Harry he had never believed Norman
      to blame.</p>
     <p>Harry himself was somewhat of a hero; the masters all spoke to him, bade him good speed, and
      wished him a happy voyage, and all the boys were eager to admire his uniform, and wish
      themselves already men and officers like Mr. May. He had his long-desired three cheers for
      'May Senior!' shouted with a thorough good-will by the united lungs of the Whichcote
      foundation, and a supplementary cheer arose for the good ship Alcestis, while hands were held
      out on every side; and the boy arrived at such a pitch of benevolence and good humour, as
      actually to volunteer a friendly shake of the hand to Edward Anderson, whom he encountered
      skulking apart.</p>
     <p>'Never mind, Ned, we have often licked each other before now, and don't let us bear a grudge
      now I am going away. We are Stoneborough fellows both, you know, after all.'</p>
     <p>Edward did not refuse the offered grasp, and though his words were only, 'Good-bye, I hope
      you will have plenty of fun!' Harry went away with a lighter heart.</p>
     <p>The rest of the day Harry adhered closely to his father, though chiefly in silence; Dr. May
      had intended much advice and exhortation for his warm-hearted, wild-spirited son, but words
      would not come, not even when in the still evening twilight they walked down alone together to
      the cloister, and stood over the little stone marked M. M. After standing there for some
      minutes, Harry knelt to collect some of the daisies in the grass.</p>
     <p>'Are those to take with you?'</p>
     <p>'Margaret is going to make a Cross of them for my Prayer-book.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, they will keep it in your mind—say it all to you, Harry. She may be nearer to you
      everywhere, though you are far from us. Don't put yourself from her.'</p>
     <p>That was all Dr. May contrived to say to his son, nor could Margaret do much more than kiss
      him, while tears flowed one by one over her cheeks, as she tried to whisper that he must
      remember and guard himself, and that he was sure of being thought of, at least, in every
      prayer; and then she fastened into his book the Cross, formed of flattened daisies, gummed
      upon a framework of paper. He begged her to place it at the Baptismal Service, for he said, 'I
      like that about fighting—and I always did like the Church being like a ship
      <pb n="290"/> —don't you? I only found that prayer out the day poor little Daisy was
      Christened.'</p>
     <p>Margaret had indeed a thrill of melancholy pleasure in this task, when she saw how it was
      regarded. Oh! that her boy might not lose these impressions amid the stormy waves he was about
      to encounter.</p>
     <p>That last evening of home good nights cost Harry many a choking sob ere he could fall
      asleep; but the morning of departure had more cheerfulness; the pleasure of patronizing Jem
      Jennings was as consoling to his spirits, as was to Mary the necessity of comforting Toby.</p>
     <p>Toby's tastes were in some respects vulgar, as he preferred the stable, and Will Adams, to
      all Mary's attentions; but he attached himself vehemently to Dr. May, followed him everywhere,
      and went into raptures at the slightest notice from him. The Doctor said it was all homage to
      the master of the house. Margaret held that the dog was a physiognomist.</p>
     <p>The world was somewhat flat after the loss of Harry—that element of riot and fun—Aubrey was
      always playing at 'poor Harry sailing away,' Mary looked staid and sober, and Norman was still
      graver, and more devoted to books, while Ethel gave herself up more completely to the
      thickening troubles of Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>Jealousies had arisen there, and these, with some rebukes for failures in sending children
      to be taught, had led to imputations on the character of Mrs. Green, in whose house the school
      was kept. Ethel was at first vehement in her defence; then when stronger evidence was adduced
      of the woman's dishonesty, she was dreadfully shocked, and wanted to give up all connexion
      with her, and in both moods was equally displeased with Richard for pausing, and not going all
      lengths with her.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot was appealed to, and did his best to investigate, but the only result was, to
      discover that no one interrogated, had any notion of truth, except John Taylor, and he knew
      nothing of the matter. The mass of falsehood, spite, violence, and dishonesty, that became
      evident, was perfectly appalling, and not a clue was to be found to the truth—scarcely a hope
      that minds so lost to honourable feeling were open to receive good impressions. It was a great
      distress to Ethel—it haunted her night and day—she lay awake pondering on the vain hopes for
      her poor children, and slept to dream of the angry faces and rude accusations. Margaret grew
      quite anxious about her, and her elders were seriously considering the propriety of her
      continuing her labours at Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot would not be at Stoneborough after Christmas. His father's declining health made
      him be required at home, and since
      <pb n="291"/> Richard was so often absent, it became matter of doubt whether the Miss Mays
      ought to be allowed to persevere, unassisted by older heads, in such a locality.</p>
     <p>This doubt put Ethel into an agony. Though she had lately been declaring that it made her
      very unhappy to go—she could not bear the sight of Mrs. Green, and that she knew all her
      efforts were vain while the poor children had such homes; she now only implored to be allowed
      to go on; she said that the badness of the people only made it more needful to do their utmost
      for them— there were no end to the arguments that she poured forth upon her ever kind
      listener, Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Yes, dear Ethel, yes, but pray be clam; I know papa and Mr. Wilmot would not put a stop to
      it, if they could possibly help it, but if it is not proper—'</p>
     <p>'Proper! that is as bad as Miss Winter!'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, you and I cannot judge of these things—you must leave them to our elders—'</p>
     <p>'And men always are so fanciful about ladies—'</p>
     <p>'Indeed, if you speak in that way, I shall think it is really hurting you.'</p>
     <p>'I did not mean it, dear Margaret,' said Ethel, 'but if you knew what I feel for poor
      Cocksmoor, you would not wonder that I cannot bear it.'</p>
     <p>'I do not wonder, dearest, but if this trial is sent you, perhaps it is to train you for
      better things.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps it is for my fault,' said Ethel. 'Oh! oh! if it be that I am too unworthy. And it
      is the only hope; no one will do anything to teach these poor creatures, if I give it up. What
      shall I do, Margaret?'</p>
     <p>Margaret drew her down close to her, and whispered, 'Trust them, Ethel dear. The decision
      will be whatever is the will of God. If he thinks fit to give you the work, it will come; if
      not, He will give you some other, and provide for them.'</p>
     <p>'If I have been too neglectful of home, too vain of persevering when no one but
      Richard-would,' sighed Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I cannot see that you have, dearest,' said Margaret, fondly, 'but your own heart must tell
      you that. And now, only try to be calm and patient. Getting into these fits of despair is the
      very thing to make people decide against you.'</p>
     <p>'I will! I will! I will try to be patient,' sobbed Ethel; 'I know to be wayward and set on
      it would only hurt. I might only do more harm—I'll try. But oh! my poor children.'</p>
     <p>Margaret gave a little space for the struggle with herself, then advised her resolutely to
      fix her attention on something else. It
      <pb n="292"/> was a Saturday morning, and time was more free than usual, so Margaret was able
      to persuade her to continue a half-forgotten drawing, while listening to an interesting
      article in a review, which opened to her that there were too many Cocksmoors in the world.</p>
     <p>The dinner hour sounded too soon, and, as she was crossing the hall, to put away her drawing
      materials, the front door gave the click peculiar to Dr. May's left-handed way of opening it.
      She paused, and saw him enter, flushed, and with a look that certified her that something had
      happened.</p>
     <p>'Well, Ethel! he is come.'</p>
     <p>'Oh papa! Mr. Ernes—'</p>
     <p>He held up his finger, drew her into the study, and shut the door. The expression of mystery
      and amusement gave way to sadness and gravity as he sat down in his arm-chair, and sighed as
      if much fatigued. She was checked and alarmed, but she could not help asking, 'Is he
      here?'</p>
     <p>'At the Swan. He came last night, and watched for me this morning, as I came out of the
      hospital. We have been walking over the meadows to Fordholm.'</p>
     <p>No wonder Dr. May was hot and tired.</p>
     <p>'But is he not coming?' asked Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes, poor fellow; but hush, stop, say nothing to the others. I must not have her agitated
      till she has had her dinner in peace, and the house is quiet. You know she cannot run away to
      her room as you would.'</p>
     <p>'Then he is really come for <hi>that?</hi> ' cried Ethel, breathlessly; and, perceiving the
      affirmative, added, 'but why did he wait so long?'</p>
     <p>'He wished to see his way through his affairs, and also wanted to hear of her from Harry. I
      am afraid poor July's colours were too bright.'</p>
     <p>'And why did he come to the Swan instead of to us?'</p>
     <p>'That was his fine, noble feeling. He thought it right to see me first, that if I thought
      the decision too trying for Margaret, in her present state, or if I disapproved of the long
      engagement, I might spare her all knowledge of his coming.'</p>
     <p>'Oh papa! you won't!'</p>
     <p>'I don't know but that I ought—but yet—the fact is, that I cannot. With that fine young
      fellow so generously, fondly attached, I cannot find it in my heart to send him away for four
      years without seeing her, and yet, poor things, it might be better for them both. O Ethel, if
      your mother were but here!'</p>
     <p>He rested his forehead on his hands, and Ethel stood aghast at his unexpected reception of
      the addresses for which she had so long hoped. She did not venture to speak, and presently he
      roused
      <pb n="293"/> himself as the dinner-bell rang. 'One comfort is,' he said, 'that Margaret has
      more composure than I. Do you go to Cocksmoor this afternoon?'</p>
     <p>'I wished it.'</p>
     <p>'Take them all with you. You may tell them why when you are out. I must have the house
      quiet. I shall get Margaret out into the shade, and prepare her, as best I can, before he
      comes at three o'clock.'</p>
     <p>It was not flattering to be thus cleared out of the way, especially when full of excited
      curiosity, but any such sensation was quite overborne by sympathy in his great anxiety, and
      Ethel's only question was, 'Had not Flora better stay, to keep off company?'</p>
     <p>'No, no,' said Dr. May, impatiently, 'the fewer the better;' and hastily passing her, he
      dashed up to his room, nearly running over the nursery procession, and, in a very few seconds,
      was seated at table, eating and speaking by snatches, and swallowing endless draughts of cold
      water.</p>
     <p>'You are going to Cocksmoor!' said he, as they were finishing.</p>
     <p>'It is the right day,' said Richard. 'Are you coming, Flora?'</p>
     <p>'Not to-day, I have to call on Mrs. Hoxton.'</p>
     <p>'Never mind Mrs. Hoxton,' said the Doctor—'you had better go to-day, a fine cool day for a
      walk.'</p>
     <p>He did not look as if he had found it so.</p>
     <p>'O yes, Flora, you must come,' said Ethel, 'we want you.'</p>
     <p>'I have engagements at home,' replied Flora.</p>
     <p>'And it really is a trying walk,' said Miss Winter.</p>
     <p>'You must,' reiterated Ethel. 'Come to our room, and I will tell you why.'</p>
     <p>'I do not mean to go to Cocksmoor till something positive is settled. I cannot have anything
      to do with that woman.'</p>
     <p>'If you would only come up-stairs,' implored Ethel, at the door, 'I have something to tell
      you alone.'</p>
     <p>'I shall come up in due time. I thought you had outgrown closetings and foolish secrets,'
      said Flora.</p>
     <p>Her movements were quickened however by her father, who, finding her with Margaret in the
      drawing-room, ordered her up-stairs in a peremptory manner, which she resented, as treating
      her like a child, and therefore proceeded in no amiable mood to the room, where Ethel awaited
      her in wild tumultuous impatienence.</p>
     <p>'Well, Ethel, what is this grand secret?'</p>
     <p>'O Flora! Mr. Ernescliffe is at the Swan! He has been speaking to papa about Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'Proposing for her, do you mean?' said Flora.</p>
     <pb n="294"/>
     <p>'Yes, he is coming to see her this afternoon, and that is the reason that papa wants us to
      be all out of the way.'</p>
     <p>'Did papa tell you this?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, beginning to perceive the secret of her displeasure, 'but only because I
      was the first person he met; and Norman guessed it long ago. Do put on your things! I'll tell
      you all I know when we are out. Papa is so anxious to have the coast clear.'</p>
     <p>'I understand,' said Flora, 'but I shall not go with you. Do not be afraid of my interfering
      with anyone. I shall sit here.'</p>
     <p>'But papa said you were to go.'</p>
     <p>'If he had done me the favour of speaking to me himself,' said Flora, 'I should have shown
      him that it is not right that Margaret should be left without anyone at hand in case she
      should be overcome. He is of no use in such cases, only makes things worse. I should not feel
      justified in leaving Margaret with no one else; but he is in one of those hand-over-head
      moods, when it is not of the least use to say a word to him.'</p>
     <p>'Flora! how can you? when he expressly ordered you.'</p>
     <p>'All he meant was, do not be in the way, and I shall not show myself unless I am needed,
      when he would be glad enough of me. I am not bound to obey the very letter, like Blanche or
      Mary.'</p>
     <p>Ethel looked horrified by the assertion of independence, but Richard called her from below,
      and with one more fruitless entreaty, she ran down stairs.</p>
     <p>Richard had been hearing all from his father, and it was comfortable to talk the matter over
      with him, and hear explained the anxiety which frightened her, while she scarcely comprehended
      it; how Dr. May could not feel certain whether it was right or expedient to promote an
      engagement which must depend on health so uncertain as poor Margaret's, and how he dreaded the
      effect on the happiness of both.</p>
     <p>Ethel's romance seemed to be turning to melancholy, and she walked on gravely and
      thoughtfully, though repeating that there could be no doubt of Margaret's perfect recovery by
      the time of the return from the voyage.</p>
     <p>Her lessons were somewhat nervous and flurried, and even the sight of two very nice neat new
      scholars, of very different appearance from the rest, and of much superior attainments, only
      half interested her. Mary was enchanted at them as a pair of prodigies, actually able to read!
      and had made out their names, and their former abodes, and how they had been used to go to
      school, and had just come to live in the cottage deserted by the lamented Una.</p>
     <pb n="295"/>
     <p>Ethel thought it quite provoking in her brother to accede to Mary's entreaties that they
      should go and call on this promising importation. Even the children's information that they
      were taught now by 'Sister Cherry' failed to attract her; but Richard looked at his watch, and
      decided that it was too soon to go home, and she had to submit to her fate.</p>
     <p>Very different was the aspect of the house from the wild Irish cabin appearance that it had
      had in the M'Carthy days. It was the remains of an old farm-house that had seen better days,
      somewhat larger than the general run of the Cocksmoor dwellings. Respectable furniture had
      taken up its abode against the walls, the kitchen was well arranged, and, in spite of the
      wretched flooring and broken windows, had an air of comfort. A very tidy woman was bustling
      about, still trying to get rid of the relics of her former tenants, who might, she much
      feared, have left a legacy of typhus fever. The more interesting person was, however, a young
      woman of three or four-and-twenty, pale, and very lame, and with the air of a respectable
      servant, her manners particularly pleasing. It appeared that she was the daughter of a first
      wife, and, after the period of schooling, had been at service, but had been lamed by a fall
      down-stairs, and had been obliged to come home, just as scarcity of work had caused her father
      to leave his native parish, and seek employment at other quarries. She had hoped to obtain
      plain work, but all the family were dismayed and disappointed at the wild spot to which they
      had come, and anxiously availed themselves of this introduction to beg that the elder boy and
      girl might be admitted into the town school, distant as it was. At another time, the thought
      of Charity Elwood would have engrossed Ethel's whole mind, now she could hardly attend, and
      kept looking eagerly at Richard as he talked endlessly with the good mother. When, at last,
      they did set off, he would not let her gallop home like a steam-engine, but made her take his
      arm, when he found that she could not otherwise moderate her steps. At the long hill, a figure
      appeared, and, as soon as Richard was certified of its identity, he let her fly, like a bolt
      from a cross-bow, and she stood by Dr. May's side.</p>
     <p>A little ashamed, she blushed instead of speaking, and waited for Richard to come up and
      begin. Neither did he say anything, and they paused till, the silence disturbing her, she
      ventured a 'Well, papa!'</p>
     <p>'Well, poor things. She was quite overcome when first I told her—said it would be hard on
      him, and begged me to tell him that he would be much happier if he thought no more of
      her.'</p>
     <p>'Did Margaret?' cried Ethel. 'Oh! could she mean it?'</p>
     <p>'She thought she meant it, poor dear, and repeated such things
      <pb n="296"/> again and again; but when I asked whether I should send him away without seeing
      her, she cried more than ever, and said, 'You are tempting me! It would be selfishness.'</p>
     <p>'O dear! she surely has seen him!'</p>
     <p>'I told her that I would be the last person to wish to tempt her to selfishness, but that I
      did not think that either could be easy in settling such a matter through a third person.'</p>
     <p>'It would have been very unkind,' said Ethel; 'I wonder she did not think so.'</p>
     <p>'She did at last. I saw it could not be otherwise, and she said, poor darling, that when he
      had seen her, he would know the impossibility; but she was so agitated, that I did not know
      how it could be.'</p>
     <p>'Has she?'</p>
     <p>'Aye, I told him not to stay too long, and left him under the tulip-tree with her. I found
      her much more composed—he was so gentle and considerate. Ah! he is the very man! Besides, he
      has convinced her now that affection brings him, not mere generosity, as she fancied.'</p>
     <p>'O, then it is settled!' cried Ethel, joyously.</p>
     <p>'I wish it were! She has owned that if—if she were in health— but that is all, and he is
      transported with having gained so much! Poor fellow. So far, I trust, it is better for them to
      know each other's minds, but how it is to be—'</p>
     <p>'But, papa, you know Sir Matthew Fleet said she was sure to get well; and in three years'
      time—'</p>
     <p>'Yes! yes, that is the best chance. But it is a dreary look out for two young things. That
      is in wiser hands, however! If only I saw what was right to do! My miserable carelessness has
      undone you all!' he concluded, almost inaudibly.</p>
     <p>It was, indeed, to him, a time of great distress and perplexity, wishing to act the part of
      father and mother both towards his daughter, acutely feeling his want of calm decision, and
      torn to pieces at once by sympathy with the lovers, and by delicacy that held him back fro
      seeming to bind the young man to an uncertain engagement, above all, tortured by self-reproach
      for the commencement of the attachment, and for the misfortune that had rendered its
      prosperity doubtful.</p>
     <p>Ethel could find no words of comfort in the bewildered glimpse at his sorrow and agitation.
      Richard spoke with calmness and good sense, and his replies, though brief and commonplace,
      were not without effect in lessening the excitement and despondency which the poor Doctor's
      present mood had been aggravating.</p>
     <p>At the door, Dr. May asked for Flora, and Ethel explained. If
      <pb n="297"/> Flora had obtruded herself, he would have been irritated, but, as it was, he had
      no time to observe the disobedience, and saying that he hoped she was with Margaret, sent
      Ethel into the drawing-room.</p>
     <p>Flora was not there, only Margaret lay on her sofa, and Ethel hesitated, shy, curious, and
      alarmed; but, as she approached, she was relieved to see the blue eyes more serene even than
      usual, while a glow of colour spread over her face, making her like the blooming Margaret of
      old times; her expression was full of peace, but became somewhat amused at Ethel's timid,
      awkward pauses, as she held out her hands, and said, 'Come, dear Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'O, Margaret, Margaret!'</p>
     <p>And Ethel was drawn into her sister's bosom. Presently she drew back, gazed at her sister
      inquiringly, and said in an odd, doubtful voice, 'Then you are glad?'</p>
     <p>Margaret nearly laughed at the strange manner, but spoke with a sorrowful tone, 'Glad in one
      way, dearest, almost too glad, and grateful.'</p>
     <p>'O, I am so glad!' again said Ethel; 'I thought it was making everybody unhappy.'</p>
     <p>'I don't believe I could be that, now he has come, now I know;' and her voice trembled.
      'There must be doubt and uncertainty,' she added, 'but I cannot dwell on them just yet. They
      will settle what is right, I know, and, happen what may, I have always <hi>this</hi> to
      remember.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! that is right! Papa will be so relieved! He was afraid it had only been distress.'</p>
     <p>'Poor papa! Yes, I did not command myself at first; I was not sure whether it was right to
      see him at all.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Margaret, that was too bad!'</p>
     <p>'it did not seem right to encourage any such—such,' the word was lost, 'to such a poor
      helpless thing as I am. I did not know what to do, and I am afraid I behaved like a silly
      child, and did not think of dear papa's feelings. But I will try to be good, and leave it all
      to them.'</p>
     <p>'And you are going to be happy?' said Ethel, wistfully.</p>
     <p>'For the present, at least. I cannot help it,' said Margaret. 'Oh! he is so kind, and so
      unselfish, and so beautifully gentle— and to think of his still caring—but there, dear Ethel,
      I am not going to cry—do call papa, or he will think me foolish again. I want him to be quite
      at ease about me before he comes.'</p>
     <p>'Then he is coming?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, at tea-time—so run, dear Ethel, and tell Jane to get his room ready.'</p>
     <p>This message quickened Ethel, and after giving it, and reporting
      <pb n="298"/> consolingly to her father, she went up to Flora, who had been a voluntary
      prisoner up-stairs all this time, and was not peculiarly gratified at such tidings coming only
      through the medium of Ethel. She had before been sensible that, superior in discretion and
      effectiveness as she was acknowledged to be, she did not share so much of the confidence and
      sympathy as some of the others, and she felt mortified and injured, though in this case it was
      entirely her own fault. The sense of alienation grew upon her.</p>
     <p>She dressed quickly, and hurried down, that she might see Margaret alone, but the room was
      already prepared for tea, and the children were fast assembling. Ethel came down a few minutes
      after, and found Blanche claiming Alan Ernescliffe as her lawful property, dancing round him,
      chattering, and looking injured if he addressed a word to anyone else.</p>
     <p>'How did lovers look? was a speculation which had, more than once, occupied Ethel, and when
      she had satisfied herself that her father was at ease, she began to study it, as soon as a
      shamefaced consciousness would allow her, after Alan's warm shake of the hand.</p>
     <p>Margaret looked much as usual, only with more glow and brightness —Mr. Ernescliffe, not far
      otherwise; he was as pale and slight as on his last visit, with the same soft blue eyes,
      capable, however, of a peculiar keen, steady glance when he was listening, and which now
      seemed to be attending to Margaret's every word or look, through all the delighted uproar
      which Aubrey, Blanche, and Mary kept up round him, or while taking his share in the general
      conversation, telling of Harry's popularity and good conduct on board the Alcestis, or
      listening to the history of Norman's school adventures, which he had heard, in part, from
      Harry, and how young Jennings was entered in the flag-ship, as a boy, though not yet to sail
      with his father.</p>
     <p>After the storm of the day, the sky seemed quite clear, and Ethel could not see that being
      lovers made much difference—to be sure papa displeased Blanche, by calling her away to his
      side, when she would squeeze her chair in between Alan's and the sofa; and Alan took all the
      waiting on Margaret exclusively to himself. Otherwise, there was nothing remarkable, and he
      was very much the same Mr. Ernescliffe whom they had received a year ago.</p>
     <p>In truth, the next ten days were very happy. The future was left to rest, and Alan spent his
      mornings in the drawing-room alone with Margaret, and looked ever more brightly placid, while,
      with the rest, he was more than the former kind play-fellow, for he now took his place as the
      affectionate elder brother, entering warmly into all their schemes and pleasures, and winning
      for himself a full measure
      <pb n="299"/> of affection from all; even his little god-daughter began to know him, and smile
      at his presence. Margaret and Ethel especially delighted in the look of enjoyment with which
      their father sat down to enter on the evening's conversation after the day's work; and Flora
      was well-pleased that Mrs. Hoxton should find Alan in the drawing-room, and ask afterwards
      about his estate; and that Meta Rivers, after being certified that this was <hi>their</hi> Mr.
      Ernescliffe, pronounced that her papa thought him particularly pleasing and gentlemanlike.
      There was something dignified in having a sister on the point of being engaged.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>

      <l>'Sail forth into the sea, thou ship,</l>

     <p>Tranquillity only lasted until Mr. Ernescliffe found it necessary to understand on
      what terms he was to stand. Everyone was tender of conscience, anxious to do right, and
      desirous to yield to the opinion that nobody could, or would give. While Alan begged for a
      positive engagement, Margaret scrupled to exchange promises that she might never be able to
      fulfil, and both agreed to leave all to her father, who, in every way, ought to have the best
      ability to judge whether there was unreasonable presumption in such a betrothal; but this very
      ability only served to perplex the poor Doctor more and more. It is far easier for a man to
      decide when he sees only one bearing of a case, than when, like Dr. May, he not only sees them,
      but is rent by them in his inmost heart. Sympathizing in turn with each lover, bitterly
      accusing his own carelessness as the cause of all their troubles, his doubts contending with
      his hopes, his conviction clashing with Sir Matthew Fleet's opinion, his conscientious
      sincerity and delicacy conflicting with his affection and eagerness, he was perfectly
      incapable of coming to a decision, and suffered so cruelly, that Margaret was doubly
      distressed for his sake, and Alan felt himself guilty of having rendered everybody
      miserable.</p>
     <pb n="300"/>
     <p>Dr. May could not conceal his trouble, and rendered Ethel almost as unhappy as himself,
      after each conversation with her, though her hopes usually sprang up again, and she had a
      happy conviction that this was only the second volume of the novel. Flora was not often called
      into his councils; confidence never came spontaneously from Dr. May to her; there was
      something that did not draw it forth towards her, whether it resided in that half-sarcastic
      corner of her steady blue eye, or in the grave common sense of her gentle voice. Her view of
      the case was known to be that there was no need for so much perplexity—why should not Alan be
      the best judge of his own happiness? If Margaret were to be delicate for life, it would be
      better to have such a home to look to; and she soothed and comforted Margaret, and talked in a
      strain of unmixed hope and anticipation that often drew a smile from her sister, though she
      feared to trust to it.</p>
     <p>Flora's tact and consideration in keeping the children away, when the lovers could best be
      alone, and letting them in, when the discussion was becoming useless and harassing, her
      cheerful smiles, her evening music that covered all sounds, her removal of all extra
      annoyances, were invaluable, and Margaret appreciated them, as, indeed, Flora took care that
      she should.</p>
     <p>Margaret begged to know her eldest brother's judgment, but had great difficulty in dragging
      it out. Diffidently as it was proposed, it was clear and decided. He thought that his father
      had better send Sir Matthew Fleet a statement of Margaret's present condition, and abide by
      his answer as to whether her progress warranted the hope of her restoration.</p>
     <p>Never was Richard more surprised than by the gratitude with which his suggestion was hailed,
      simple as it was, so that it seemed obvious that others should have already thought of it.
      After the tossings of uncertainty, it was a positive relief to refer the question to some
      external voice, and only Ethel and Norman expressed strong dislike to Sir Matthew becoming the
      arbitrer of Margaret's fate, and were scarcely pacified by Dr. May's assurance, that he had
      not revealed the occasion of his inquiry. The letter was sent, and repose returned, but hearts
      beat high on the morning when the answer was expected.</p>
     <p>Dr. May watched the moment when his daughter was alone, carried the letter to her, and
      kissing her, said, with an oppressed voice, 'I give you joy, my dear.'</p>
     <p>She read with suspended breath and palpitating heart. Sir Matthew thought her improvement
      sure, though slow, and had barely a doubt, that, in a year, she would have regained her full
      strength and activity.</p>
     <pb n="301"/>
     <p>'You will show it to Alan,' said Dr. May, as Margaret lifted her eyes to his face
      inquiringly.</p>
     <p>'Will not you?' she said.</p>
     <p>'I cannot,' he answered. 'I wish I was more helpful to you, my child,' he added, wistfully,
      'but you will rest on him, and be happy together while he stays, will you not?'</p>
     <p>'Indeed I will, dear papa.'</p>
     <p>Mr. Ernescliffe was with her as the Doctor quitted her. She held the letter to him, 'But,'
      she said, slowly, 'I see that papa does not believe it.'</p>
     <p>'You promised to abide by it!' he exclaimed, between entreaty and authority.</p>
     <p>'I do; if you choose so to risk your hopes.'</p>
     <p>'But,' cried he, as he glanced hastily over the letter, 'there can be no doubt! These words
      are as certain as language can make them. Why will you not trust them?'</p>
     <p>'I see that papa does not.'</p>
     <p>'Despondency and self-reproach make him morbidly anxious. Believe so, my Margaret! You know
      he is no surgeon!'</p>
     <p>'His education included that line,' said Margaret. 'I believe he has all but the manual
      dexterity. However, I would fain have faith in Sir Matthew,' she added, smiling, 'and perhaps
      I am only swayed by the habit of thinking that papa must know best.'</p>
     <p>'He does in indifferent cases; but it is an old axiom, that a medical man should not
      prescribe for his own family; above all, in such a case, where it is but reasonable to believe
      an unprejudiced stranger, who alone is cool enough to be relied on. I absolutely depend on
      him!'</p>
     <p>Margaret absolutely depended on the bright cheerful look of conviction. 'Yes,' she said, 'we
      will try to make papa take pleasure in the prospect. Perhaps I could do more if I made the
      attempt.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure you could, if you would let me give you more support. If I were but going to
      remain with you!'</p>
     <p>'Don't let us be discontented,' said Margaret, smiling, 'when so much more has been granted
      than I dare to hope. Be it as it may, let us be happy in what we have.'</p>
     <p>'It makes you happy?' said he, archly reading her face to draw out the avowal, but he only
      made her hide it, with a mute caress of the hand that held hers. She was glad enough to rest
      in the present, now that everything concurred to satisfy her conscience in so doing, and come
      what might, the days now spent together would be a possession of joy for ever.</p>
     <pb n="302"/>
     <p>Captain Gordon contrived to afford his lieutenant another fortnight's leave, perhaps because
      he was in dread of losing him altogether, for Alan had some doubts, and many longings to
      remain. Had it been possible to marry at once, he would have quitted the navy immediately; and
      he would have given worlds to linger beside Margaret's couch, and claim her the first moment
      possible, believing his care more availing than all. He was, however, so pledged to Captain
      Gordon, that, without strong cause, he would not have been justified in withdrawing; besides,
      Harry was under his charge, and Dr. May and Margaret both thought, with the captain, that an
      active life would be a better occupation for him than watching her. He would never be able to
      settle down at his new home comfortably without her, and he would be more in the way of duty
      while pursuing his profession, so Margaret nerved herself against using her influence to
      detain him, and he thanked her for it.</p>
     <p>Though hope and affection could not at once repair an injured spine, they had wonderful
      powers in inciting Margaret to new efforts. Alan was as tender and ready of hand as Richard,
      and more clever and enterprising; and her unfailing trust in him prevented all alarms and
      misgivings, so that wonders were effected, and her father beheld her standing with so little
      support, looking so healthful and so blithe, that his forebodings melted away, and he talked
      joyously of the future.</p>
     <p>The great achievement was taking her round the garden. She could not bear the motion of
      wheels, but Alan adopted the hammock principle, and, with the aid of Richard and his crony,
      the carpenter, produced a machine in which no other power on earth could have prevailed on her
      to trust herself, but in which she was carried round the garden so successfully, that there
      was even a talk of next Sunday, and of the Minster.</p>
     <p>It was safely accomplished, and tired as she was, Margaret felt, as she whispered to Alan,
      that he had now crowned all the joy that he had brought to her.</p>
     <p>Ethel used to watch them, and think how beautiful their countenances were, and talk them
      over with her father, who was quite happy about them now. She gave assistance, which Alan
      never once called unhandy, to all his contrivances, and often floundered in upon his
      conferences with Margaret, in a way that would have been very provoking, if she had not always
      blushed and looked so excessively discomfited, that they had only to laugh and reassure
      her.</p>
     <p>Alan was struck by finding that the casual words spoken on the way from Cocksmoor had been
      so strenuously acted on, and he brought on himself a whole torrent of Ethel's confused
      narratives,
      <pb n="303"/> which Richard and Flora would fain have checked; but Margaret let them continue,
      as she saw him a willing listener, and was grateful to him for comprehending the ardent
      girl.</p>
     <p>He declared himself to have a share in the matter, reminding Ethel of her appeal to him to
      bind himself to the service of Cocksmoor. he sent a sovereign at once, to aid in a case of the
      sudden death of a pig; and when securely established in his brotherly right, he begged Ethel
      to let him know what would help her most. She stood colouring, twisting her hands, and
      wondering what to say, whereupon he relieved her by a proposal to leave an order for ten
      pounds, to be yearly paid into her hands, as a fixed income for her school.</p>
     <p>A thousand a year could hardly have been so much to Ethel. 'Thank you! Oh, this is charming!
      We could set up a regular school! Cherry Elwood is the very woman! Alan, you have made our
      fortune! Oh! Margaret! Margaret! I must go and tell Ritchie and Mary!' This is the first real
      step to our Church and all!'</p>
     <p>'May I do it?' said Alan, turning to Margaret, as Ethel frantically burst out of the room;
      'perhaps I should have asked leave?'</p>
     <p>'I was going to thank you,' said Margaret. 'It is the very kindest thing you could have done
      by dear Ethel! the greatest comfort to us. She will be at peace now, when anything hinders her
      from going to Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'I wonder,' said Alan, musing, 'whether we shall ever be able to help her more
      substantially. I cannot do anything hastily, for you know Maplewood is still in the hands of
      the executors, and I cannot tell what claims there may be upon me; but-by-and-by, when I
      return, if I find no other pressing duty, might not a Church at Cocksmoor be a thankoffering
      for all I have found here?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Alan, what joy it would be!</p>
     <p>'It is a long way off,' he said, sadly; 'and perhaps her force of perseverance will have
      prevailed alone.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose I must not tell her, even as a vision.'</p>
     <p>'It is too uncertain; I do not know the wants of the Maplewood people, and I must provide
      for Hector. I would not let these vague dreams interfere with her resolute work; but,
      Margaret, what a vision it is! I can see you laying the first stone on that fine heathy
      brow.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! your godchild should lay the first stone!'</p>
     <p>'She shall, and you shall lead her. And there shall be Ethel's sharp face full of
      indescribable things as she marshals her children, and Richard shall be Curate, and read in
      his steady soft tone, and your father shall look sunny with his boys around him, and you—'</p>
     <pb n="304"/>
     <p>'Oh! Alan!' said Margaret, who had been listening with a smile, 'it is, indeed, a long way
      off!'</p>
     <p>'I shall look to it as the haven where I would be,' said the sailor.</p>
     <p>They often spoke together of this scheme, ever decking it in brighter colours. The topic
      seemed to suit them better than their own future, for there was no dwelling on that without an
      occasional misgiving, and the more glad the anticipation, the deeper the sigh that followed on
      Margaret's part, till Mr. Ernescliffe followed her lead, and they seldom spoke of these
      uncertainties, but outwardly smiled over the present, inwardly dwelt on the truly certain
      hopes. There were readings shared together, made more precious than all, by the conversations
      that ensued.</p>
     <p>The hour for parting came at last. Ethel never knew what passed in the drawing-room, whence
      everyone was carefully excluded. Dr. May wandered about, keeping guard over the door, and
      watching the clock, till, at the last moment, he knocked, and called in a trembling voice,
      'Ernescliffe! Alan! It is past the quarter! You must not stay!'</p>
     <p>The other farewells were hurried; Alan seemed voiceless, only nodding in reply to Mary's
      vociferous messages to Harry, and huskily whispering to Ethel, 'Good luck to Cocksmoor!'</p>
     <p>The next moment the door had shut on him, and Dr. May and Flora had gone to her sister, whom
      she found not tearful, but begging to be left alone.</p>
     <p>When they saw her again, she was cheerful; she kept up her composure and animation without
      flagging, nor did she discontinue her new exertions, but seemed decidedly the happier for all
      that had passed.</p>
     <p>Letters came every day for her, and presents to everyone. Ethel had a gold chain and
      eye-glass, which, it was hoped, might cure her of frowning and stooping, though her various
      ways of dangling her new possession, caused her to be so much teazed by Flora and Norman,
      that, but for regard to Margaret's feelings, she would not have worn it for three days.</p>
     <p>To Mary was sent a daguerreotype of Harry, her glory and delight. Say, who would, that it
      had pig's eyes, a savage frown, a pudding chin, there were his own tight rings of hair, his
      gold-banded cap, his bright buttons, how could she prize it enough? She exhibited it to the
      little ones ten times a day, she kissed it night and morning, and registered her vow always to
      sleep with it under her 'pilow,' in a letter of thanks, which Margaret defended and
      despatched, in spite of Miss Winter's horrors at its disregard of orthography.</p>
     <pb n="305"/>
     <p>It was nearly the last letter before the Alcestis was heard of at Spithead. Then she sailed;
      she sent in her letters to Plymouth, and her final greetings by a Falmouth cutter—poor Harry's
      wild scrawl in pencil, looking very sea-sick.</p>
     <p>'Dear papa and all, good-bye. We are out of sight of land. Three years, and keep up a good
      heart. I shall soon be all right.</p>
     <p>Your <hi>H. May.'</hi></p>
     <p>It was inclosed in Mr. Ernescliffe's envelope, and with it came tidings that Harry's brave
      spirit was not failing, even under untoward circumstances, but he had struggled on deck, and
      tried to write, when all his contemporaries had given in; in fact, he was a fine
      fellow—everyone liked him, and Captain Gordon, though chary of commendation, had held him up
      to the other youngsters as an example of knowing what a sailor was meant to be like.</p>
     <p>Margaret smiled, and cried over the news when she imparted it— but all serenely—and though
      she was glad to be alone, and wrote journals for Alan, when she could not send letters, she
      exerted herself to be the same sister as usual to the rest of the household, and not to give
      way to her wandering musings.</p>
     <p>From one subject her attention never strayed. Ethel had never found any lack of sympathy in
      her for her Cocksmoor pursuits; but the change now showed, that where once Margaret had been
      interested, merely as a kind sister, she now had a personal concern, and she threw herself
      into all that related to it as her own chief interest and pursuit—becoming the foremost in
      devising plans, and arranging the best means of using Mr. Ernescliffe's benefaction.</p>
     <p>The Elwood family had grown in the good opinion of the Mays. Charity had hobbled to Church,
      leaning on her father's arm, and being invited to dinner in the kitchen, the acquaintance had
      been improved, and nurse herself had pronounced her such a tidy, good sort of body, that it
      was a pity she had met with such a misfortune. If Miss Ethel brought in nothing but the like
      of her, they should be welcome—poor thing, how tired she was!</p>
     <p>Nurse's opinions were apt to be sagacious, especially when in the face of her prejudices,
      and this gave Margaret confidence. Cherry proved to have been carefully taught by a good
      Clergyman and his wife, and to be of very different stamp from the persons to whom the girls
      were accustomed. They were charmed with her, and eagerly offered to supply her with
      books—respecting her the more when they found that Mr. Hazlewood had already lent her their
      chief favourites. Other and greater needs they had no power to fill up.</p>
     <p>'It is so lone without the Church bells, you see, Miss,' said Mrs. Elwood. 'Our tower had a
      real fine peal, and my man was
      <pb n="306"/> one of the ringers. I seems quite lost without them, and there was Cherry, went
      a'most every day with the children.'</p>
     <p>'Every day!' cried Mary, looking at her with respect.</p>
     <p>'It was so near,' said Cherry, 'I could get there easy, and I got used to it when I was at
      school.'</p>
     <p>'Did it not take up a great deal of time?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Why, you see, Ma'am, it came morning and night, out of working times, and I can't be
      stirring much.'</p>
     <p>'Then you miss it sadly?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes, Ma'am, it made the day go on well like, and settled a body's mind, when I fretted for
      what could not be helped. But I try not to fret after it now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did
      my best wherever I was, the Lord would still join our prayers together.'</p>
     <p>Mr. Hazlewood was recollected by Mr. Wilmot as an old College friend, and a correspondence
      with him fully confirmed the favourable estimate of the Elwoods, and was decisive in
      determining that the day-school, with Alan's ten pounds as salary, and a penny a week from
      each child, should be offered to Cherry.</p>
     <p>Mr. Hazlewood answered for her sound excellence, and aptitude for managing little children,
      though he did not promise genius, such as should fulfil the requirements of modern days. With
      these Cocksmoor could dispense at present; Cherry was humbly gratified, and her parents
      delighted with the honour and profit; there was a kitchen which afforded great facilities, and
      Richard and his carpenter managed the fitting to admiration; Margaret devised all manner of
      useful arrangements, settled matters with great earnestness, saw Cherry frequently, discussed
      plans, and learnt the history and character of each child, as thoroughly as Ethel herself. Mr.
      Ramsden himself came to the opening of the school, and said so much of the obligations of
      Cocksmoor to the young ladies, that Ethel would not have known which way to look, if Flora had
      not kindly borne the brunt of his compliments.</p>
     <p>Everyone was pleased, except Mrs. Green, who took upon herself to set about various
      malicious reports of Cherry Elwood; but nobody cared for them, except Mrs. Elwood, who flew
      into such passions, that Ethel was quite disappointed in her, though not in Cherry, who meekly
      tried to silence her mother, begged the young ladies not to be vexed, and showed a quiet
      dignity that soon made the shafts of slander fall inoffensively.</p>
     <p>All went well; there was a school instead of a hubbub, clean faces instead of dirty, shining
      hair instead of wild elf-locks, orderly children instead of little savages. The order and
      obedience that Ethel could not gain in six months, seemed impressed in six days by Cherry; the
      neat work made her popular with the mothers, her
      <pb n="307"/> firm gentleness won the hearts of the children, and the kitchen was filled not
      only with boys and girls from the quarry, but with some little ones from outlying cottages of
      Fordholm and Abbotstoke, and there was even a smart little farmer, who had been unbearable at
      home.</p>
     <p>Margaret's unsuccessful Bath chair was lent to Cherry, and in it her scholars drew her to
      Stoneborough every Sunday, and slowly began to redeem their character with the ladies, who
      began to lose the habit of shrinking out of their way—the Stoneborough children did so
      instead; and Flora and Ethel were always bringing home stories of injustice to their scholars,
      fancied or real, and of triumphs in their having excelled any national school girl. The most
      stupid children at Cocksmoor always seemed to them wise in comparison with the Stoneborough
      girls, and the Sunday-school might have become to Ethel a school of rivalry, if Richard had
      not opened her eyes by a quiet observation, that the town girls seemed to fare as ill with
      her, as the Cocksmoor girls did with the town ladies. Then she caught herself up, tried to be
      candid, and found that she was not always impartial in her judgments. Why would competition
      mingle even in the best attempts?</p>
     <p>Cherry did not so bring forward her scholars, that Ethel could have many triumphs of this
      dangerous kind. Indeed, Ethel was often vexed with her; for though she taught needlework
      admirably, and enforced correct reading, and reverent repetition, her strong provincial
      dialect was a stumbling-block; she could not put questions without book, and nothing would
      teach her Ethel's rational system of arithmetic. That she was a capital dame, and made the
      children very good, was allowed; but now and then, when mortified by hearing what was done at
      Stoneborough, Fordholm, or Abbotstoke, Ethel would make vigorous efforts, which resulted only
      in her coming home fuming at Cherry's 'outrageous dullness.'</p>
     <p>These railings always hurt Margaret, who had made Cherry almost into a friend, and generally
      liked to have a visit from her during the Sunday, when she always dined with the servants.
      Then school questions, Cocksmoor news, and the tempers of the children, were talked over, and
      Cherry was now and then drawn into home reminiscences, and descriptions of the ways of her
      former school. There was no fear of spoiling her—notice from her superiors was natural to her,
      and she had the lady-likeness of womanly goodness, so as never to go beyond her own place. She
      had had many trials too, and Margaret learnt the true history of them, as she won Cherry's
      confidence, and entered into them, feeling their likeness, yet dissimilarity, to her own.</p>
     <p>Cherry had been a brisk happy girl in a good place, resting in
      <pb n="308"/> one of the long engagements that often extend over half the life of a servant,
      enjoying the nod of her baker as he left his bread, and her walk from Church with him on
      alternate Sundays. But poor Cherry had been exposed to the perils of window cleaning; and,
      after a frightful fall, had wakened to find herself in a hospital, and her severe sufferings
      had left her a cripple for life.</p>
     <p>And the baker had not been an Alan Ernescliffe! She did not complain of him—he had come to
      see her, and had been much grieved, but she had told him she could never be a useful wife; and
      before she had used her crutches, he was married to her pretty fellow-servant.</p>
     <p>Cherry spoke very simply; she hoped it was better for Long, and believed Susan would make
      him a good wife. Ethel would have thought she did not feel, but Margaret knew better.</p>
     <p>She stroked the thin slight fingers, and gently said, 'Poor Cherry!' and Cherry wiped away a
      tear, and said, 'Yes, Ma'am, thank you, it is best for him. I should not have wished him to
      grieve for what cannot be helped.'</p>
     <p>'Resignation is the great comfort.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, Ma'am. I have a great deal to be thankful for. I don't blame no one, but I do see how
      some, as are married, seem to get to think more of this world; and now and then I fancy I can
      see how it is best for me as it is.'</p>
     <p>Margaret sighed, as she remembered certain thoughts before Alan's return.</p>
     <p>'Then, Ma'am, there has been such goodness! I did vex at being a poor helpless thing,
      nothing but a burthen on father; and when we had to go from home, and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood
      and all, I can't tell you how bad it was, Ma'am.'</p>
     <p>'Then you are comforted now?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, Ma'am,' said Cherry, brightening. 'It seems as if He had given me something to do, and
      there are you and Mr. Richard, and Miss Ethel, to help. I should like, please God, to be of
      some good to those poor children.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure you will, Cherry; I wish I could do as much.'</p>
     <p>Cherry's tears had come again. 'Ah! Ma'am, you—' and she stopped short, and rose to depart.
      Margaret held out her hand to wish her good-bye. 'Please, Miss, I was thinking how Mr.
      Hazlewood said that God fits our place to us, and us to our place.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, Cherry, you are leaving me something to remember.'</p>
     <p>And Margaret lay questioning with herself, whether the school-mistress had not been the most
      self-denying of the two; but withal gazing on the hoop of pearls which Alan had chosen as the
      ring of betrothal.</p>
     <pb n="309"/>
     <p>'The Pearl of great price,' murmured she to herself; 'if we hold that, the rest will soon
      matter but little! It remaineth that both they that have wives, be as they that have none, and
      they that weep, as though they wept not, and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not!
      If ever Alan and I have a home together upon earth, may all too confident joy be tempered by
      the fears that we have begun with! I hope this probation may make me less likely to be taken
      up with the cares and pleasures of his position, than I might have been last year. He is one
      who can best help the mind to go truly upward! But, oh! that voyage!'</p>

     <p>'What a bore!'</p>
     <p>'What's the matter now?'</p>
     <p>'Here has this old fellow asked me to dinner again!'</p>
     <p>'A fine pass we are come to!' cried Dr. May, half amused, half irate. 'I should like to know
      what I should have said at your age, if the head-master had asked me to dinner.'</p>
     <p>'Papa is not so very fond of dining at Dr. Hoxton's,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'A whipper-snapper schoolboy, who might be thankful to dine anywhere!' continued Dr. May,
      while the girls burst out laughing, and Norman looked injured.</p>
     <p>'It is very ungrateful of Norman,' said Flora; 'I cannot see what he finds to complain
      of.'</p>
     <p>'You would know,' said Norman, 'if, instead of playing those perpetual tunes of yours, you
      had to sit it out in that perfumy drawing-room, without anything to listen to worth hearing.
      If I have looked over that Court Album once, I have a dozen times, and there is not another
      book in the place!'</p>
     <p>'I am glad there is not,' said Flora. 'I am quite ashamed to see you for ever turning over
      those old pictures! You cannot guess how stupid you look. I wonder Mrs. Hoxton likes to have
      you,' she added, patting his shoulders between jest and earnest.</p>
     <p>'I wish she would not, then! It is only to escort you.'</p>
     <pb n="310"/>
     <p>'Nonsense, Norman, you know better!' cried Ethel. 'You know it is for your own sake, and to
      make up for their injustice, that he invites you, or Flora either.'</p>
     <p>'Hush, Ethel! he gives himself quite airs enough already,' said the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'Papa!' said Ethel, in vexation, though he gave her a pinch to show it was all in good
      humour, while he went on, 'I am glad to hear they do leave him to himself in a corner. A very
      good thing too! Where else should a great gawky schoolboy be?'</p>
     <p>'Safe at home, where I wish he would let me be,' muttered Norman, though he contrived to
      smile, and followed Flora out of the room, without subjecting himself to the imputation of
      offended dignity.</p>
     <p>Ethel was displeased, and began her defence: 'Papa! I wish—' and there she checked
      herself.</p>
     <p>'Eh! Miss Ethel's bristles up!' said her father, who seemed in a somewhat mischievous mood
      of teazing.</p>
     <p>'How could you, papa?' cried she.</p>
     <p>'How could I what, Miss Etheldred?'</p>
     <p>'Plague Norma,'—the words would come. 'Accuse him of airs.'</p>
     <p>'I hate to see young fellows above taking an honour from their elders,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Now, papa, papa, you know it is no such thing. Dr. Hoxton's parties are very dull—you know
      they are, and it is not fair on Norman. If he was set up and delighted at going so often, then
      you would call him conceited.'</p>
     <p>'Conceit has a good many lurking-places,' said Dr. May. 'It is harder to go and be
      overlooked, than to stay at home.'</p>
     <p>'Now, papa, you are not to call Norman conceited!' cried Ethel. 'You don't believe that he
      is any such thing.'</p>
     <p>'Why, not exactly,' said Dr. May, smiling. 'The boy has missed it marvellously; but, you
      see, he has everything that subtle imp would wish to feed upon, and it is no harm to give him
      a lick with the rough side of the tongue, as your canny Scots grandfather used to say.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! if you knew, papa—' began Ethel.</p>
     <p>'If I knew?'</p>
     <p>'No, no, I must not tell.'</p>
     <p>'What, a secret, is there?'</p>
     <p>'I wish it was not; I should like to tell you very much, but then, you see, it is Norman's,
      and you are to be surprised.'</p>
     <p>'Your surprise is likely to be very much like Blanche's birthday presents, a stage
      aside.'</p>
     <p>'No, I <hi>am</hi> going to keep it to mysalf.'</p>
     <pb n="311"/>
     <p>Two or three days after, as Ethel was going to the school-room after breakfast, Dr. May
      beckoned her back to the dining-room, and, with his merry look of significance, said, 'Well,
      ma'am, I have found out your mystery!'</p>
     <p>'About Norman? Oh papa! Did he tell you?'</p>
     <p>'When I came home from the hospital last night, at an hour when all respectable characters,
      except doctors and police, should be in their warm beds, I beheld a light in Norman's window,
      so methought I would see what Gravity was doing out of his bed at midnight—'</p>
     <p>'And you found him at his Greek—'</p>
     <p>'So that was the meaning of his looking so lank and care-worn, just as he did last year, and
      he the prince of the school! I could have found it in my heart to fling the books at his
      head!'</p>
     <p>'But you consent, don't you, to his going up for the scholarship?'</p>
     <p>'I consent to anything, as long as he keeps within due bounds, and does not work himself to
      death. I am glad of knowing it, for now I can put a moderate check upon it.'</p>
     <p>'And did he tell you all about it?'</p>
     <p>'He told me he felt as if he owed it to us to gain something for himself, since I had given
      up the Randall to gratify him—a pretty sort of gratification.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, and he will be glad to get away from school. He says he knows it is bad for him—as it
      is uncomfortable to be singled out in the way Dr. Hoxton does now. You know,' pleaded Ethel,
      'it is not ingratitude or elation, but it is, somehow, not <hi>nice</hi> to be treated as he
      is, set apart from the rest.'</p>
     <p>'True; Dr. Hoxton never had taste or judgment. If Norman were not a <hi>lusus natureæ</hi>
      ,' said Dr. May, hesitating for a word, 'his head would have been turned long ago. And he
      wants companions too—he has been forced out of boyhood too soon, poor fellow—and Harry gone
      too. He does not get anything like real relaxation, and he will be better among youths than
      boys. Stoneborough will never be what it was in my time!' added the Doctor, mournfully. 'I
      never thought to see the poor old place come to this; but there— when all the better class
      send their sons to the great public schools, and leave nothing but riff-raff here, one is
      forced, for a boy's own sake, to do the same.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! I am so glad! Then you have consented to the rest of Norman's scheme, and will not keep
      poor little Tom at school here without him?'</p>
     <p>'By what he tells me, it would be downright ruin to the boy. I little thought to have to
      take a son of mine away from Stoneborough;
      <pb n="312"/> but Norman is the best judge, and be is the only person who seems to have made
      any impression on Tom, so I shall let it be. In fact,' he added, half smiling, 'I don't know
      what I could refuse old June.'</p>
     <p>'That's right!' cried Ethel. 'That is so nice! Then, if Norman gets the scholarship, Tom is
      to go to Mr. Wilmot first, and then to Eton!'</p>
     <p>'If Norman gains the scholarship, but that is an if,' said Dr. May, as though hoping for a
      loop-hole to escape offending the shade of Bishop Whichcote.</p>
     <p>'Oh, papa, you cannot doubt of that!'</p>
     <p>'I cannot tell, Ethel. He is <hi>facile princeps</hi> here in his own world, but we do not
      know how it may be when he is measured with public schoolmen, who have had more first-rate
      tutorship than poor old Hoxton's.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! he says so, but I thought that was all his humility.'</p>
     <p>'Better he should be prepared. If he had had all those advantages —but it may be as well
      after all. I always had a hankering to have sent him to Eton, but your dear mother used to say
      it was not fair on the others. And now, to see him striving in order to give the advantage of
      it to his little brother! I only hope Master Thomas is worthy of it—but it is a boy I can't
      understand.'</p>
     <p>'Nor I,' said Ethel; 'he never seems to say anything he can help, and goes after Norman
      without talking to anyone else.'</p>
     <p>'I give him up to Norman's management!' said Dr. May. 'He says the boy is very clever, but I
      have not seen it; and, as to more serious matters.—However, I must take it on Norman's word,
      that he is wishing to learn truth. We made an utter mistake about him; I don't know who is to
      blame for it.'</p>
     <p>'Have you told Margaret about Norman's plan?' asked Ethel.</p>
     <p>'No; he desired me to say nothing. Indeed, I should not like Tom's leaving school to be
      talked of beforehand.'</p>
     <p>'Norman said he did not want Flora to hear, because she is so much with the Hoxton's, and he
      said they would all watch him.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, aye! and we must keep his secret. What a boy it is! But it is not safe to say
      conceited things. We shall have a fall yet, Ethel. Not seventeen, remember, and brought up at
      a mere grammar-school.'</p>
     <p>'But we shall still have the spirit that made him try,' said Ethel, 'and that is the
      thing.'</p>
     <p>'and, to tell you the truth,' said the Doctor, lingering, 'for my own part, I don't care a
      rush for it!' and he dashed off to his work, while Ethel stood laughing.</p>
     <pb n="313"/>
     <p>'Papa was so very kind,' said Norman, tremulously, when Ethel followed him to his room, to
      congratulate him on having gained his father's assent, of which he had been more in doubt than
      she.</p>
     <p>'And you see he quite approves of the scheme for Tom, except for thinking it disrespect to
      Bishop Whichcote. He said he only hoped Tom was worthy of it.'</p>
     <p>'Tom!' cried Norman. 'Take my word for it, Ethel, Tom will surprise you all. He will beat us
      all to nothing, I know!'</p>
     <p>'If only he can be cured of—'</p>
     <p>'He will,' said Norman, 'when once he has outgrown his frights, and that he may do at Mr.
      Wilmot's, apart from those fellows. When I go up for this scholarship, you must look after his
      lessons, and see if you are not surprised at his construing!'</p>
     <p>'When you go. It will be in a month!'</p>
     <p>'He has told no one, I hope.'</p>
     <p>'No; but I hardly think he will bear not telling Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'Well—I hate a thing being out of ones own keeping. I should not so much dislike Margaret's
      knowing, but I <hi>won't</hi> have Flora know—mind that, Ethel,' he said, with
      disproportionate vehemence.</p>
     <p>'I only hope Flora will not be vexed. But, oh dear! how nice it will be when you have it,
      telling Meta Rivers, and all!'</p>
     <p>'And this is a fine way of getting it, standing talking here. Not that I shall—You little
      know what public schools can do! But that is no reason against trying.'</p>
     <p>'Good night, then. Only one thing more. You mean that, till further orders, Margaret should
      not know?'</p>
     <p>'Of course,' said Norman, impatiently. 'She won't take any of Flora's silly affronts, and,
      what is more, she would not care half so much as before Alan Ernescliffe came.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, Norman, Norman! I'm sure—'</p>
     <p>'Why, it is what they always say. Everybody can't be first, and Ernescliffe has the biggest
      half of her, I can see.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure I did not,' said Ethel, in a mortified voice.</p>
     <p>'Why, of course, it always comes of people having lovers.'</p>
     <p>'Then I am sure I won't!' exclaimed Ethel.</p>
     <p>Norman went into a fit of laughing.</p>
     <p>'You may laugh, Norman, but I will never let papa or any of you be second to anyone!' she
      cried, vehemently.</p>
     <p>A brotherly home-truth followed: 'Nobody asked you, sir, she said!' was muttered by Norman,
      still laughing heartily.</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Ethel, not in the least offended, 'I am very ugly, and very awkward, but I
      don't care. There never can be anybody in all the world that I shall like half as well as
      papa, and I am glad no one is ever likely to make me care less for him and Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <pb n="314"/>
     <p>'Stay till you are tried,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>Ethel squeezed up her eyes, curled up her nose, showed her teeth in a horrible grimace, and
      made a sort of snarl: 'Yah! That's the face I shall make at them!' and then, with another
      good-night, ran to her own room.</p>
     <p>Norman was, to a certain extent, right with regard to Margaret —her thoughts and interest
      had been chiefly engrossed by Alan Ernescliffe, and, so far drawn away from her own family,
      that when the Alcestis was absolutely gone beyond all reach of letters for the present,
      Margaret could not help feeling somewhat of a void, and as if the home concerns were not so
      entire an occupation for her mind as formerly.</p>
     <p>She would fain have thrown herself into them again, but she became conscious that there was
      a difference. She was still the object of her father's intense tenderness and solicitude,
      indeed she could not be otherwise, but it came over her sometimes that she was less necessary
      to him than in the first year. He was not conscious of any change, and, indeed, it hardly
      amounted to a change, and yet Margaret, lying inactive and thoughtful, began to observe that
      the fullness of his confidence was passing to Ethel. Now and then it would appear that he
      fancied he had told Margaret little matters, when he had really told them to Ethel—and it was
      Ethel who would linger with him in the drawing-room after the others had gone up at night, or
      who would be late at the morning's reading, and disarm Miss Winter, by pleading that papa had
      been talking to her. The secret they shared together was, of course, the origin of much of
      this; but also Ethel was now more entirely the Doctor's own than Margaret could be after her
      engagement; and there was a likeness of mind between the father and daughter that could not
      but develop more in this year, that in all Ethel's life, when she had made the most rapid
      progress. Perhaps, too, the Doctor looked on Margaret rather as the authority and mistress of
      his house, while Ethel was more of a playfellow; and thus, without either having the least
      suspicion that the one sister was taking the place of the other, and without any actual
      neglect of Margaret, Ethel was his chief companion.</p>
     <p>'How excited and anxious Norman looks!' said Margaret, one day, when he had rushed in at the
      dinner-hour, asking for his father, and, when he could not find him, shouting out for Ethel.
      'I hope there is nothing amiss. He has looked thin and worn for some time, and yet his work at
      school is very easy to him.'</p>
     <p>'I wish there may be nothing wrong there again,' said Flora. 'There! there's the front door
      banging! He is off! Ethel!'— stepping to the door, and calling in her sister, who came from
      the
      <pb n="315"/> street door, her hair blowing about with the wind.—'What did Norman want?'</p>
     <p>'Only to know whether papa had left a note for Dr. Hoxton,' said Ethel, looking very
      confused and very merry.</p>
     <p>'That was not all,' said Flora. 'Now don't be absurd, Ethel—I hate mysteries.'</p>
     <p>'Last time I had a secret, you would not believe it,' said Ethel, laughing.</p>
     <p>'Come!' exclaimed Flora, 'why cannot you tell us at once what is going on?'</p>
     <p>'Because I was desired not,' said Ethel. 'You will hear it soon enough,' and she capered a
      little.</p>
     <p>'Let her alone, Flora,' said Margaret. 'I see there is nothing wrong.'</p>
     <p>'If she is desired to be silent, there is nothing to be said,' replied Flora, sitting down
      again, while Ethel ran away to guard her secret.</p>
     <p>'Absurd!' muttered Flora. 'I cannot imagine why Ethel is always making mysteries!'</p>
     <p>'She cannot help other people having confidence in her,' said Margaret, gently.</p>
     <p>'She need not be so important, then,' said Flora—'always having private conferences with
      papa! I do not think it is at all fair on the rest.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel is a very superior person,' said Margaret, with half a sigh.</p>
     <p>Flora might toss her head, but she attempted no denial in words.</p>
     <p>'And,' continued Margaret, 'if papa does find her his best companion and friend, we ought to
      be glad of it.'</p>
     <p>'I do not call it just,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I do not think it can be helped,' said Margaret; 'the best <hi>must</hi> be preferred.'</p>
     <p>'As to that, Ethel is often very ridiculous and silly.'</p>
     <p>'She is improving every day; and you know dear mamma always thought her the finest character
      amongst us.'</p>
     <p>'Then you are ready to be left out, and have your third sister always put before you?'</p>
     <p>'No, Flora, that is not the case. Neither she nor papa would ever be unfair; but, as she
      would say herself, what they can't help, they can't help; and, as she grows older, she must
      surpass me more and more.'</p>
     <p>'And you like it?'</p>
     <p>'I like it—when—when I think of papa, and of his dear, noble Ethel. I <hi>do</hi> like it,
      when I am not selfish.'</p>
     <p>Margaret turned away her head, but presently looked up again.</p>
     <p>'Only, Flora,' she said, 'pray do not say one word of this, on any account, to Ethel. She is
      so happy with papa, and I would
      <pb n="316"/> not, for anything, have her think I feel neglected, or had any jealousy.'</p>
     <p>'Ah,' thought Flora, 'you can give up sweetly, but you have Alan to fall back upon. Now I,
      who certainly have the best right, and a great deal more practical sense—'</p>
     <p>Flora took Margaret's advice, and did not reproach Ethel, for a little reflection convinced
      her that she should make a silly figure in so doing, and she did not like altercations.</p>
     <p>It was the same evening that Norman came in from school with his hands full of papers, and,
      with one voice, his father and Ethel exclaimed, 'You have them?'</p>
     <p>'Yes;' and he gave a letter to his father, while Blanche, who had a very inquisitive pair of
      eyes, began to read from a paper he placed on the table.</p>
     <p>'Norman Walter, son of Richard and Margaret May, High-street, Doctor of Medicine, December
      21st, 18—Thomas Ramsden.'</p>
     <p>'What is that for, Norman?' and, as he did not attend, she called Mary to share her
      speculations, and spell out the words.</p>
     <p>'Ha!' cried Dr. May, 'this is capital! The old Doctor seems not to know how to say enough
      for you. Have you read it?'</p>
     <p>'No, he only told me he had said something in my favour, and wished me all success.'</p>
     <p>'Success!' cried Mary. 'Oh, Norman, you are not going to sea, too?'</p>
     <p>'No, no!' interposed Blanche, knowingly—'he is going to be married. I heard nurse wish her
      brother success when he was going to marry the washerwoman with a red face.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Mary, 'people never are married till they are twenty.'</p>
     <p>'But I tell you,' persisted Blanche, 'people always write like this, in a great book in
      Church, when they are married. I know, for we always go into Church with Lucy and nurse, when
      there is a wedding.'</p>
     <p>'Well, Norman, I wish you success with the bride you are to court,' said Dr. May—much
      diverted with the young ladies' conjectures.</p>
     <p>'But is it really?' said Mary, making her eyes as round as full moons.</p>
     <p>'Is it really?' repeated Blanche—'Oh dear! is Norman going to be married? I wish it was to
      be Meta Rivers, for then I could always ride her dear little white pony.'</p>
     <p>'Tell them,' whispered Norman, a good deal out of countenance, as he leant over Ethel, and
      quitted the room.</p>
     <p>Ethel cried, 'Now then!' and looked at her father, while Blanche and Mary reiterated
      inquiries—marriage, and going to sea, being
      <pb n="317"/> the only events that, in their imagination, the world could furnish. Going to
      try for a Balliol scholarship! It was a sad falling off, even if they understood what it
      meant. The Doctor's explanations to Margaret had a tone of apology for having kept her in
      ignorance, and Flora said few words, but felt herself injured; she had nearly gone to Mrs.
      Hoxton that afternoon, and how strange it would have been if anything had been said to her of
      her own brother's projects, when she was in ignorance.</p>
     <p>Ethel slipped away to her brother, who was in his own room, surrounded with books, flushed
      and anxious, and trying to glance over each subject on which he felt himself weak.</p>
     <p>'I shall fail! I know I shall!' was his exclamation. 'I wish I had never thought of it!'</p>
     <p>'What? did Dr. Hoxton think you not likely to succeed?' cried Ethel, in consternation.</p>
     <p>'Oh! he said I was certain, but what is that? We Stoneborough men only compare ourselves
      with each other. I shall break down to a certainty, and my father will be disappointed.'</p>
     <p>'You will do your best?'</p>
     <p>'I don't know that. My best will all go away when it comes to the point.'</p>
     <p>'Surely not. It did not go away last time you were examined, and why should it now?'</p>
     <p>'I tell you, Ethel, you know nothing about it. I have not got up half what I meant to have
      done. Here, do take this book—try me whether I know this properly.'</p>
     <p>So they went on, Ethel doing her best to help and encourage, and Norman in an excited state
      of restless despair, which drove away half his senses and recollection, and his ideas of the
      superior powers of public school-boys magnifying every moment. They were summoned down-stairs
      to prayers, but went up again at once, and more than an hour subsequently, when their father
      paid one of his domiciliary visits, there they still were, with their Latin and Greek spread
      out, Norman trying to strengthen all doubtful points, but, in a desperate desultory manner,
      that only confused him more and more, till he was obliged to lay his head down on the table,
      shut his eyes, and run his fingers through his hair, before he could recollect the simplest
      matter; his renderings alternated with groans, and, cold as was the room, his cheeks and brows
      were flushed and burning.</p>
     <p>The Doctor checked all this, by saying, gravely and sternly, 'This is not right, Norman.
      Where are all your resolutions?'</p>
     <p>'I shall never do it. I ought never to have thought of it! I shall never succeed!'</p>
     <pb n="318"/>
     <p>'What, if you do not?' said Dr. May, laying his hand on his shoulder.</p>
     <p>'What? why Tom's chance lost—you will all be mortified,' said Norman, hesitating in some
      confusion.</p>
     <p>'I will take care of Tom,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'And he will have been foiled!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'If he is?'</p>
     <p>The boy and girl were both silent.</p>
     <p>'Are you striving for mere victory's sake, Norman?' continued his father.</p>
     <p>'I thought not,' murmured Norman.</p>
     <p>'Successful or not, you will have done your utmost for us. You would not lose one jot of
      affection, or esteem, and Tom shall not suffer. Is it worth this agony?'</p>
     <p>'No, it is foolish,' said Norman, with trembling voice, almost as if he could have burst
      into tears. He was quite unnerved by the anxiety and toil with which he had overtasked
      himself, beyond his father's knowledge.</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa!' pleaded Ethel, who could not bear to see him pained.</p>
     <p>'It is foolish,' continued Dr. May, who felt it was the moment for bracing severity. 'It is
      rendering you unmanly. It is wrong.'</p>
     <p>Again Ethel made an exclamation of entreaty.</p>
     <p>'It is wrong, I know,' repeated Norman; but you don't know what is to get into the spirit of
      the thing.'</p>
     <p>'Do you think I do not?' said the Doctor; 'I can tell exactly what you feel now. If I had
      not been an idle dog, I should have gone through it all many more times.'</p>
     <p>'What shall I do?' asked Norman, in a worn-out voice.</p>
     <p>'Put all this out of your mind, sleep quietly, and don't open another book.'</p>
     <p>Norman moved his head, as if sleep were beyond his power.</p>
     <p>'I will read you something to calm your tone,' said Dr. May, and he took up a Prayer-Book.
      "'Know ye not, that they which run in a race, run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run
      that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery, is temperate in all things.
      Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible." And, Norman, that is
      not the struggle where the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; nor the
      contest, where the conqueror only wins vanity and vexation of spirit.'</p>
     <p>Norman had cast down his eyes, and hardly made answer, but the words had evidently taken
      effect. The Doctor only further bade him good night, with a whispered blessing, and, taking
      Ethel by the hand, drew her away.</p>
     <pb n="319"/>
     <p>When they met the next morning, the excitement had passed from Norman's manner, but he
      looked dejected and resigned. He had made up his mind to lose, and was not grateful for good
      wishes; he ought never to have thought, he said, of competing with men from public-schools,
      and he knew his return of love of vain-glory deserved that he should fail. However, he was now
      calm enough not to be likely to do himself injustice by nervousness, and Margaret had hopes
      that Richard's steady equable mind, would have a salutary influence. So, commending Tom's
      lessons to Ethel, and hearing, but not marking, countless messages to Richard, he set forth
      upon his <hi>emprise</hi> , while his anxiety seemed to remain as a legacy for those at
      home.</p>
     <p>Poor Dr. May confessed that his practice by no means agreed with his precept, for he could
      think of nothing else, and was almost as bad as Norman, in his certainty that the boy would
      fail from mere nervousness. Margaret was the better companion for him now, attaching less
      intensity of interest to Norman's success, than did Ethel; she was the more able to compose
      him, and cheer his hopes.</p>

     <p>Tea had just been brought in on the eighth evening from Tom's departure, when there
      was a ring at the bell. There was a start, and look of expectation. 'Only a patient,' said the
      Doctor; but it surely was not for that reason that he rose with so much alacrity and opened
      the door, nor was 'Well, old fellow?' the greeting for his patients—so everybody sprang after
      him, and beheld something tall taking off a coat, while a voice said, 'I have got it.'</p>
     <p>The mass of children rushed back to Margaret, screaming, 'He has got it!' and then Aubrey
      trotted out into the hall again to see what Norman had got.</p>
     <p>'A happy face at least,' said Margaret, as he came to her. And that was not peculiar to
      Norman. The radiance had shone out
      <pb n="320"/> upon everyone in that moment, and it was one buzz of happy exclamation, query
      and answer—the only tone of regret when Mary spoke of Harry, and all at once took up the
      strain—how glad poor Harry would be. As to the examination, that had been much less difficult
      than Norman had expected; in fact, he said, it was lucky for him that the very subjects had
      been chosen in which he was most up—luck which, as the Doctor could not help observing,
      generally did attend Norman. And Norman had been so happy with Richard; the kind, wise, elder
      brother had done exactly what was best for him in soothing his anxiety, and had fully shared
      his feelings, and exulted in his success. Margaret had a most triumphant letter, dwelling on
      the abilities of the candidates whom Norman had outstripped, and the idea that everyone had
      conceived of his talent. 'Indeed,' wrote Richard, 'I fancy the men had never believed that I
      could have a clever brother. I am glad they have seen what Norman can do.'</p>
     <p>Margaret could not help reading this aloud, and it made Norman blush with the compunction
      that Richard's unselfish pride in him always excited. He had much to tell of his ecstasy with
      Oxford. Stoneborough Minster had been a training in appreciation of its hoary beauty, but the
      essentially prosaic Richard had never prepared him for the impression that the Reverend old
      University made on him, and he was already, heart and soul, one of her most loyal and loving
      sons, speaking of his College and of the whole University as one who had a right of property
      in them, and looking, all the time, not elated, but contented, as if he had found his sphere
      and was satisfied. He had seen Cheviot, too, and had been very happy in the renewed
      friendship; and had been claimed as a cousin by a Balliol man, a certain Norman Ogilvie, a
      name well known among the Mays. 'And how has Tom been getting on?' he asked, when he returned
      to home affairs.</p>
     <p>'Oh! I don't know,' said Ethel. 'He will not have my help.'</p>
     <p>'Not let you help him?' exclaimed Norman.</p>
     <p>'No. He says he wants no girls,' said Ethel, laughing.</p>
     <p>'Foolish fellow!' said Norman. 'I wonder what sort of work he has made!'</p>
     <p>'Very funny, I should think,' said Ethel, 'judging by the verses I could see.'</p>
     <p>The little pale rough-haired Tom, in his perpetual coating of dust, softly crept into the
      room, as if he only wanted to elude observation; but Mary and Blanche were at once
      vociferating their news in his ears, though with little encouragement—he only shook them off
      abruptly, and would not answer when they required him to be glad.</p>
     <pb n="321"/>
     <p>Norman stretched out his arm, intercepting him as he was making for his hiding-place behind
      Dr. May's arm-chair.</p>
     <p>'Come, August, how have things gone on?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! I don't know.'</p>
     <p>'What's your place?'</p>
     <p>'Thirteenth!' muttered Tom in his throat, and well he might, for two or three voices cried
      out that was too bad, and that it was all his own fault, for not accepting Ethel's help. He
      took little heed, but crept to his corner without another word, and Mary knew she should be
      thumped, if she should torment him there.</p>
     <p>Norman left him alone, but the coldness of the little brother for whom he had worked, gave a
      greater chill to his pleasure than he could have supposed possible. He would rather have had
      some cordiality on Tom's part, than all the congratulations that met him the next day.</p>
     <p>He could not rest contented while Tom continued to shrink from him, and he was the more
      uneasy when, on Saturday morning, no calls from Mary availed to find the little boy, and bring
      him to the usual reading and Catechism.</p>
     <p>Margaret decided that they must begin without him, and poor Mary's verse was read, in
      consequence, with a most dolorous tone. As soon as the books were shut, she ran off, and a few
      words passed among the elder ones about the truant—Flora opining that the Andersons had led
      him away; Ethel suggesting that his gloom must arise from his not being well; and Margaret
      looking wistfully at Norman, and saying she feared they had judged much amiss last spring.</p>
     <p>Norman heard in silence, and walked thoughtfully into the garden. Presently he caught Mary's
      voice in expostulation: How could you not come to read!'</p>
     <p>'Girls' work!' growled another voice, out of sight.</p>
     <p>'But Norman, and Richard, and Harry, always come to the reading. Everybody ought.'</p>
     <p>Norman, who was going round the shrubs that concealed the speakers from him, here lost their
      voices, but, as he emerged in front of the old tool-house, he heard a little scream from Mary,
      and, at the same moment, she darted back, and fell over a heap of cabbage-stumps in front of
      the old tool-house. It was no small surprise to her to be raised by him, and tenderly asked
      whether she were hurt. She was not hurt, but she could not speak without crying, and when
      Norman begged to hear what was the matter, and where Tom was, she would only plead for
      him—that he did not intend to hurt her, and that she had been teasing him. What had he done to
      frighten her? Oh! he had <hi>only</hi> run at her with a hoe, because she was
      <pb n="322"/> troublesome; she did not mind it, and Norman must not—and she clung to him as if
      to keep him back, while he pursued his researches in the tool-house, where, nearly concealed
      by a great bushel-basket, lurked Master Thomas, crouching down, with a volume of Gil Blas in
      his hand.</p>
     <p>'You here! Tom! What have you hidden yourself here for? What can make you so savage to
      Mary?'</p>
     <p>'She should not bother me,' said Tom, sulkily.</p>
     <p>Norman sent Mary away, pacifying her by promises that he would not revenge her quarrel upon
      Tom, and then, turning the basket upside down, and perching himself astride on it, he began:
      'That is the kindest, most forgiving little sister I ever did see. What possesses you to treat
      her so ill?'</p>
     <p>'I wasn't going to hurt her.'</p>
     <p>'But why drive her away? Why don't you come to read?' No answer; and Norman, for a moment,
      felt as if Tom were really hopelessly ill-conditioned and sullen, but he persevered in
      restraining his desire to cuff the ill-humour out of him, and continued: 'Come! there's
      something wrong, and you will never be better till it is out. Tell me—don't be afraid. Those
      fellows have been at you again?'</p>
     <p>He took Tom by the arm to draw him nearer, but a cry and start of pain were the result. 'So
      they have licked you? Eh? What have they been doing?'</p>
     <p>'They said they would spiflicate me if I told!' sighed Tom.</p>
     <p>'They shall never do anything to you—' and, by-and-by, a sobbing confession was drawn forth,
      muttered at intervals, as low as if Tom expected the strings of onions to hear and betray him
      to his foes. Looking on him as a deserter, these town-boys had taken advantage of his
      brother's absence, to heap on him every misery they could inflict. There had been a wager
      between Edward Anderson and Sam Axworthy as to what Tom could be made to do, and his personal
      timidity made him a miserable victim, not merely beaten and bruised, but forced to transgress
      every rule of right and wrong that had been enforced on his conscience. On Sunday, they had
      profited by the absence of their Dux, to have a jollification at a little public-house, not
      far from the playing-fields; and here had Tom been dragged in, forced to partake with them,
      and frightened with threats that he had treated them all, and was liable to pay the whole
      bill, which, of course, he firmly believed, as well as that he should be at least
      half-murdered if he gave his father any suspicion that the whole had not been consumed by
      himself. Now, though poor Tom's conscience had lost many scruples during the last spring, the
      offence, into which he had been forced, was too heinous to a child brought up as he had been,
      to be palliated even in his own eyes.
      <pb n="323"/> The profanation of Sunday, and the carousal in a public-house, had combined to
      fill him with a sense of shame and degradation, which was the real cause that he felt himself
      unworthy to come and read with his sisters. His grief and misery were extreme, and Norman's
      indignation was such as could find no utterance. He sat silent, quivering with anger, and
      clenching his fingers over the handle of the hoe.</p>
     <p>'I knew it!' sighed Tom. 'None of you will ever speak to me again!'</p>
     <p>'You! Why, August, man, I have better hopes of you than ever. You are more really sorry now
      than ever you were before.</p>
     <p>'I had never been at the Green Man before,' said poor Tom, feeling his future life
      stained.</p>
     <p>'You never will again!'</p>
     <p>'When you are gone—' and the poor victim's voice died away.</p>
     <p>'Tom, you will not stay after me. It is settled that when I go to Balliol, you leave
      Stoneborough, and go to Mr. Wilmot as pupil. Those scamps shall never have you in their
      clutches again.'</p>
     <p>It did not produce the ecstasy Norman had expected. The boy still sat on the ground, staring
      at his brother, as if the good news hardly penetrated the gloom; and, after a disappointing
      silence, recurred to the most immediate cause of distress: 'Eight shillings and
      tenpence-halfpenny! Norman, if you would only lend it to me, you shall have all my tin till I
      have made it up—sixpence a week, and half-a-crown on New Year's Day.'</p>
     <p>'I am not going to pay Mr. Axworthy's reckoning,' said Norman, rather angrily. 'You will
      never be better till you have told my father the whole.'</p>
     <p>'Do you think they will send in the bill to my father?' asked Tom, in alarm.</p>
     <p>'No, indeed! that is the last thing they will do,' said Norman; 'but I would not have you
      come to him only for such a sneaking reason.'</p>
     <p>'But the girls would hear it. Oh! if I thought Mary and Margaret would ever hear it—Norman,
      I can't—'</p>
     <p>Norman assured him that there was not the slightest reason that these passages should ever
      come to the knowledge of his sisters. Tom was excessively afraid of his father, but he could
      not well be more wretched than he was already; and he was brought to assent when Norman showed
      him that he had never been happy since the affair of the blotting-paper, when his father's
      looks and tones had become objects of dread to his guilty conscience. Was not the only means
      of recovering a place in papa's esteem to treat him with confidence?</p>
     <pb n="324"/>
     <p>Tom answered not, and would only shudder when his brother took upon him to declare that free
      confession would gain pardon even for the doings at the Green Man.</p>
     <p>Tom had grown stupified and passive, and his sole dependence was on Norman, so, at last, he
      made no opposition when his brother offered to conduct him to his father and speak for him.
      The danger now was that Dr. May should not be forthcoming, and the elder brother was as much
      relieved, as the younger was dismayed, to see, through the drawing-room window, that he was
      standing beside Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Papa, can you come and speak to me,' said Norman, 'at the door?'</p>
     <p>'Coming! What now?' said the Doctor, entering the hall. 'What, Tom, my boy, what is it?' as
      he saw the poor child, white, cold, almost sick with apprehension, with every pulse throbbing,
      and looking positively ill. He took the chilly, damp hand, which shook nervously, and would
      fain have withdrawn itself.</p>
     <p>'Come, my dear, let us see what is amiss;' and before Tom knew what he was doing, he had
      seated him on his knee, in the arm-chair in the study, and was feeling his pulse. 'There, rest
      your head! Has it not been aching all day?'</p>
     <p>'I do not think he is ill,' said Norman; 'but there is something he thinks I had better tell
      you.'</p>
     <p>Tom would fain have been on his feet, yet the support of that shoulder was inexpressibly
      comfortable to his aching temples, and he could not but wait for the shock of being roughly
      shaken and put down. So, as his brother related what had occurred, he crouched and trembled
      more and more on his father's breast, till, to his surprise, he found the other arm passed
      round him in support, drawing him more tenderly close.</p>
     <p>'My poor little fellow!' said Dr. May, trying to look into the drooping face, 'I grieve to
      have exposed you to such usage as this! I little thought it of Stoneborough fellows!'</p>
     <p>'He is very sorry,' said Norman, much distressed by the condition of the culprit.</p>
     <p>'I see it—I see it plainly,' said Dr. May. 'Tommy, my boy, why should you tremble when you
      are with me?'</p>
     <p>'He has been in great dread of your being displeased.'</p>
     <p>'My boy, do you not know how I forgive you?'</p>
     <p>Tom clung round his neck, as if to steady himself. 'Oh! papa! I thought you would
      never—'</p>
     <p>'Nay, you need never have thought so, my boy! What have I done that you should fear me?'</p>
     <p>Tom did not speak, but nestled up to him with more confidence;
      <pb n="325"/> 'There! that's better! Poor child! what he must have suffered! He was not fit
      for the place! I had thought him looking ill. Little did I guess the cause.'</p>
     <p>'He says his head has ached ever since Sunday,' said Norman; 'and I believe he has hardly
      eaten or slept properly since.'</p>
     <p>'He shall never be under their power again! Thanks to you, Norman. Do you hear that,
      Tommy?'</p>
     <p>The answer was hardly audible. The little boy was already almost asleep, worn out with all
      he had undergone. Norman began to clear the sofa, that they might lay him down, but his father
      would not hear of disturbing him, and, sending Norman away, sat still for more than an hour,
      until the child slowly awoke, and scarcely recalling what had happened, stood up between his
      father's knees, rubbing his eyes, and looking bewildered.</p>
     <p>'You are better now, my boy?'</p>
     <p>'I thought you would be very angry,' slowly murmured Tom, as the past returned on him.</p>
     <p>'Never, while you are sorry for your faults, and own them freely.'</p>
     <p>'I'm glad I did,' said the boy, still half asleep. 'I did not know you would be so
      kind.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! Tom, I fear it was as much my fault as yours, that you did not know it. But, my dear,
      there is a pardon that can give you better peace than mine.'</p>
     <p>'I think,' muttered Tom, looking down—'I think I could say my prayers again now, if—'</p>
     <p>'If what, my dear?'</p>
     <p>'If you would help me, as mamma used—'</p>
     <p>There could be but one response to this speech.</p>
     <p>Tom was still giddy and unwell, his whole frame affected by the troubles of the last week,
      and Dr. May arranged him on the sofa, and desired him to be quiet, offering to send Mary to be
      his companion. Tom was languidly pleased, but renewed his entreaty, that his confession might
      be a secret from his sisters. Dr. May promised, and Mary, quite satisfied at being taken into
      favour, asked no questions, but spent the rest of the morning in playing at draughts with him,
      and, in having inflicted on her the history of the Bloody Fire King's Ghost—a work of Tom's
      imagination, which he was wont to extemporize, to the extreme terror of much enduring
      Mary.</p>
     <p>When Dr. May had called Mary, he next summoned Norman, who found him in the hall, putting on
      his hat, and looking very stern and determined.</p>
     <p>'Norman!' said he, hastily, 'don't say a word—It must be done —Hoxton must hear of
      this.'</p>
     <pb n="326"/>
     <p>Norman's face expressed utter consternation.</p>
     <p>'It is not your doing. It is no concern of yours,' said Dr. May, walking impetuously into
      the garden. 'I find my boy ill, broken down, shattered—it is the usage of this crew of
      fellows—what right have I to conceal it—leave other people's sons to be so served?'</p>
     <p>'I believe they did so to Tom out of ill-will to me,' said Norman, 'and because they thought
      he had ratted.'</p>
     <p>'Hush! don't argue against it,' said Dr. May, almost petulantly. 'I have stood a great deal
      to oblige you, but I cannot stand this, When it is a matter of corruption, base cruelty—no,
      Norman, it is not right—not another word!'</p>
     <p>Norman's words had not been many, but he felt a conviction that, in spite of the dismay and
      pain to himself, Dr. May ought to meet with submission to his judgment, and he acquiesced by
      silence.</p>
     <p>'Don't you see,' continued thé Doctor; 'if they act thus, when your back is turned, what is
      to happen next half? 'Tis not for Tom's sake, but how could we justify it to ourselves, to
      expose other boys to this usage?'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman, not without a sigh. 'I suppose it must be.'</p>
     <p>'That is right,' said Dr. May, as if much relieved. 'I knew you must see it in that light. I
      do not mean to abuse your confidence.'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed,' answered Norman warmly.</p>
     <p>'But you see yourself, that where the welfare of so many is at stake, it would be
      wickedness—yes, wickedness to be silent. Could I see that little fellow prostrated, trembling
      in my arms, and think of those scamps inflicting the same on other helpless children—away from
      their homes!'</p>
     <p>'I see, I see!' said Norman, carried along by the indignation and tenderness that agitated
      his father's voice in his vehemence— 'it is the only thing to be done.'</p>
     <p>'It would be sharing the guilt to hide it,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Very well,' said Norman, still reluctantly. 'What do you wish me to do? You see, as Dux, I
      know nothing about it. It happened while I was away.'</p>
     <p>'True, true,' said his father. 'You have learnt it as brother, not as senior boy. Yes, we
      had better have you out of the matter. It is I who complain of their usage of my son.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Norman, with gratitude.</p>
     <p>'You have not told me the names of these fellows. No, I had best not know them.'</p>
     <p>'I think it might make a difference,' hesitated Norman.</p>
     <p>'No, no, I will not hear them. It ought to make none. The fact is the same, be they who they
      may.'</p>
     <pb n="327"/>
     <p>The Doctor let himself out at the garden gate, and strode off at a rapid pace, conscious
      perhaps, in secret, that if he did not at once yield to the impulse of resentment, good-nature
      would overpower the sense of justice. His son returned to the house with a heavy sigh, yet
      honouring the generosity that had respected his scruples, when merely his own worldly loss was
      involved, but set them aside when the good of others was concerned. By-and-by Dr. May
      reappeared. The headmaster had been thoroughly roused to anger, and had begged at once to
      examine May junior, for whom his father was now come.</p>
     <p>Tom was quite unprepared for such formidable consequences of his confession, and began by
      piteous tears and sobs, and when these had, with some difficulty, been pacified, he proved to
      be really so unwell and exhausted, that his father could not take him to Minster-street, and
      was obliged to leave him to his brother's keeping, while he returned to the school.</p>
     <p>Upon this, Dr. Hoxton came himself, and the sisters were extremely excited and alarmed by
      the intelligence that he was in the study with papa and Tom.</p>
     <p>Then away went the gentlemen; and Mary was again called to comfort Tom, who, broken down
      into the mere longing for sympathy, sobbed out all his troubles to her, while her eyes
      expanded more and more in horror, and her soft heart giving way, she cried quite as pitifully,
      and a great deal more loudly; and so the other sisters learnt the whole, and Margaret was
      ready for her father, when he came in, in the evening, harassed and sorrowful. His anger was
      all gone now, and he was excessively grieved at finding that the ringleaders, Samuel Axworthy
      and Edward Anderson, could, in Dr. Hoxton's opinion, receive no sentence but explusion, which
      was to be pronounced on them on Monday.</p>
     <p>Sam Axworthy was the son of a low, uneducated man, and his best chance had been the going to
      this school; but he was of a surly, obstinate temper, and showed so little compunction, that
      even such superabundant kindness as Dr. May's, could not find compassion for him; especially
      since it had appeared that Tom had been by no means the only victim, and that he had often
      been the promoter of the like mal-practices, which many boys were relieved to be forced to
      expose.</p>
     <p>For Edward Anderson, however, or rather for his mother, Dr. May was very sorry, and had even
      interceded for his pardon; but Dr. Hoxton, though slow to be roused, was far less placable
      than the other Doctor, and would not hear of anything but the most rigorous justice.</p>
     <p>'Poor Mrs. Anderson, with her pride in her children!' Flora
      <pb n="328"/> spoke it with a shade of contemptuous pity, but it made her father groan.</p>
     <p>'I shall never be able to look in her face again! I shall never see that boy without feeling
      that I have ruined him.'</p>
     <p>'He needed nobody to do that for him,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'With every disadvantage!' continued Dr. May; 'unable even to remember his father! Why could
      I not be more patient and forbearing?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa!' was the general cry—Norman's voice giving decision to the sisters'
      exclamation.</p>
     <p>'Perhaps,' said Margaret, 'the shock may be the best thing for him.'</p>
     <p>'Right, Margaret,' said her father. 'Sometimes such a thing is the first that shows what a
      course of evil really is.'</p>
     <p>'They are an affectionate family too,' said Margaret, 'and his mother's grief may have an
      effect on him.'</p>
     <p>'If she does not treat him as an injured hero,' said Flora; 'besides, I see no reason for
      regret. These are but two, and the school is not to be sacrificed to them.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman; 'I believe that Ashe will be able to keep much better order without
      Axworthy. It is much better as it is, but Harry will be very sorry to hear it, and I wish this
      half was over.'</p>
     <p>Poor Mrs. Anderson! her shower of notes rent the heart of the one Doctor, but were tossed
      carelessly aside by the other. On that Sunday, Norman held various conversations with his
      probable successor, Ashe, a gentle, well-disposed boy, hitherto in much dread of the post of
      authority, but owning, that, in Axworthy's absence, the task would be comparatively easy, and
      that Anderson would probably originate far less mischief.</p>
     <p>Edward Anderson himself fell in Norman's way in the street, and was shrinking aside, when a
      word, of not unfriendly greeting, caused him to quicken his steps, and say, hesitatingly, 'I
      say, how is August?'</p>
     <p>'Better, thank you; he will be all right in a day or two.'</p>
     <p>'I say, we would not have bullied him so, if he had not been in such a fright at
      nothing.'</p>
     <p>'I dare say not.'</p>
     <p>'I did not mean it all, but that sort of thing makes a fellow go on,' continued Edward,
      hanging down his head, very sorrowful and downcast.</p>
     <p>'If it had only been fair bullying; but to take him to that place —to teach him falsehood—'
      said Norman.</p>
     <p>Edward's eyes were full of tears; he almost owned the whole.
      <pb n="329"/> He had not thought of such things, and then Axworthy—It was more evident from
      manner, than words, that the boy did repent, and was greatly overcome both by his own
      disgrace, and his mother's distress, wishing earnestly to redeem his character, and declaring,
      from the bottom of his heart, that he would avoid his former offences. He was emboldened at
      last to say, with hesitation, 'Could not you speak to Doctor Hoxton for me?'</p>
     <p>'My father has said all he could in your behalf.'</p>
     <p>Edward's eye glanced towards Norman in wonder, as he reecollected that the Mays must know
      that a word from him would have saved Norman from unjust punishment, and the loss of the
      scholarship, and he said, 'good night,' and turned aside to his own home, with a heavy
      sigh.</p>
     <p>Norman took another turn, looked up at the sky, twisted his hands together in perplexity,
      mumbled something about hating to do a thing when it was all for no use, and then marched off
      towards Minster-street, with a pace like his father's the day before.</p>
     <p>When he came forth again from Dr. Hoxton's study, he did not believe that his intercession
      had produced the least effect, and there was a sense of vexation at the position which he had
      assumed. He went home, and said nothing on the subject; but when, on Monday, the school was
      assembled, and the judgment announced, it was Axworthy alone whose friends had been advised to
      remove him.</p>
     <p>Anderson received a severe punishment, as did all those who had shared in the revel at the
      Green Man. Even Tom, and another little boy, who had been likewise drawn in, were obliged to
      stay within narrow bounds, and to learn heavy impositions; and a stern reprimand and
      exhortation were given to the school collectively. Anderson, who had seen from the window that
      turn towards Minster-street, drew his own conclusions, and was not insensible to the
      generosity that had surpassed his hopes, though to his faltering attempt to thanks, Norman
      replied that he did not believe it was owing to him, and never exposed himself to Flora's
      wonder, by declaring at home what he had done.</p>
     <p>So the last weeks of the half-year passed away with the boys in a subdued, but hopeful
      manner, and the reformation, under Norman's ausplces, progressed so well, that Ashe might
      fairly expect to reap the benefit of the discipline, established at so much cost.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot had looked on, and given his help, but he was preparing to leave Stoneborough,
      and there was great concern at the parting with such a friend. Ethel, especially, mourned the
      loss to Cocksmoor, and, for though hers had been the executive part, his had been the head,
      and he was almost equally grieved to go from the newly-begun work.</p>
     <pb n="330"/>
     <p>Margaret lamented the loss of her kind counsellor, and the ready hearer of her anxieties for
      the children. Writing could ill supply the place of their conversations, and she feared
      likewise that her father would feel the want of his companionship. The promise of visits, and
      the intercourse kept up by Tom's passing to and fro, was the best consolation.</p>
     <p>Poor Margaret had begun to flag, both in strength and spirits, as winter approached, but
      there came a revival in the shape of 'Ship Letters!' Alan wrote cheerfully and graphically,
      with excellent accounts of Harry, who, on his side, sent very joyous and characteristic
      despatches, only wishing that he could present Mary with all the monkeys and parrots he had
      seen at Rio, as well as the little ruby-crested humming-birds, that always reminded him of
      Miss Rivers.</p>
     <p>With the Christmas holidays, Hector Ernescliffe came from Eton, as to a home, and was
      received by Margaret as a sort of especial charge. It was pretty to see how he turned to her
      as something peculiarly his own, and would sit on a footstool by her, letting himself be drawn
      into confidence, and dwelling on his brother's past doings, and on future schemes for
      Maplewood. For the rest, he restored to the house the atmosphere of boy, which had somewhat
      departed with Harry. Mary, who had begun to be tamed down, ran more wild than ever, to the
      utter despair of Miss Winter; and Tom, now that his connexion with the Whichcote foundation
      was over, and he was no more cowed by the sight of his tyrants, came out in a new light. He
      put on his boy-nature, rioted like the rest, acquired colour in his cheeks, divested his
      jacket of perpetual dust, had his hair cut, brushed up a crest on his head, and ran about no
      longer a little abject, but a merry lad.</p>
     <p>Ethel said it was a change from Horrid-locks to Harfagre; Margaret said little, but like her
      father, she blessed Norman in her heart for having given back the boy to his father's
      confidence, and saved him so far from the terrible course of deceit and corruption. She could
      not much take to heart the mad exploits of the so-called boys, even though she spent three
      hours in heart-beatings on Christmas Eve, when Hector, Mary. Tom, Blanche, and the dog Toby,
      were lost the whole day. However they did come back at six o'clock, having been deluded by an
      old myth of George Larkins, into starting for a common, three miles beyond Cocksmoor, in
      search of mistletoe, with scarlet berries, and yellow holly, with leaves like a porcupine!
      Failing these wonders, they had been contenting themselves with scarlet holly, in the Drydale
      plantations, when a rough voice exclaimed, 'Who gave you leave to take that?' whereupon Tom
      had plunged into a thicket, and nearly 'scratched out both his eyes;'
      <pb n="331"/> but Hector boldly standing his ground, with Blanche in his hand, the woodman
      discovered that here was the Miss Mary, of whom his little girls talked so much, thereupon cut
      down the choicest boughs, and promised to leave a full supply at Dr. May's. Margaret could
      have been angry at the taking the young ladies on so mad a scheme, but then Mary was so happy,
      and as to Hector, how scold him, when he had lifted Blanche over every ditch, and had carried
      her home one mile on his back, and another, Queen's-cushion fashion, between him and Mary?</p>
     <p>Flora, meanwhile, went her own way. The desire of compensating for what had past with
      Norman, led to great civilities from Dr. and Mrs. Hoxton, which nobody was at liberty to
      receive except Flora. Pretty, graceful, and pleasing, she was a valuable companion to a gentle
      little, inane lady, with more time and money than she knew what to do with; and Mrs. Hoxton,
      who was of a superior grade to the Stoneborough ladies in general, was such a chaperon as
      Flora was glad to secure. Dr. May's old loyal feelings could not help regarding her notice of
      his daughter as a favour and kindness, and Margaret could find no tangible objections, nor any
      precedent from her mother's conduct, even had anyone had the power to interfere with one so
      quiet, reasonable, and determined as Flora.</p>
     <p>So the intimacy became closer and closer, and as the winter passed on, Flora gradually
      became established as the dear friend and assistant, without whom Mrs. Hoxton could give no
      party. Further, Flora took the grand step of setting up a copperplate and cards of 'Miss Flora
      May,' went out frequently on morning calls with Mrs. Hoxton and her bay horses, and when Dr.
      May refused his share of invitations to dinner with the neighbours in the country, Flora
      generally found that she could go under the Hoxtons' guardianship.</p>

     <p>'That is better!' said Margaret, contemplating a butterfly of the penwiper class,
      whose constitution her dextrous needle had been rendering less ricketty than Blanche had left
      it.</p>
     <p>Margaret still lay on the sofa, and her complexion had assumed the dead white of habitual
      ill-health. There was more languor of manner, and her countenance, when at rest, and not under
      the eye of her father, had a sadness of expression, as if any hopes, that she might once have
      entertained, were fading away. The years of Alan Ernescliffe's absence that had elapsed had
      rather taken from her powers than added to them. Nevertheless, the habit of cheerfulness and
      sympathy had not deserted her, and it was with a somewhat amused glance that she turned
      towards Ethel, as she heard her answer by a sigh.</p>
     <p>These years had dealt more kindly with Etheldred's outward appearance. They had rounded her
      angles, softened her features, and tinged her cheeks with a touch of red, that took off from
      the surrounding sallowness. She held herself better, had learnt to keep her hair in order, and
      the more womanly dress, plain though it was, improved her figure more than could have been
      hoped in the days of her lank, gawky girlhood. No one could call her
      <pb n="336"/> pretty, but her countenance had something more than ever pleasing in the
      animated and thoughtful expression on those marked features. She was sitting near the window,
      with a book, a dictionary and pencil, as she replied to Margaret, with the sigh that made her
      sister smile.</p>
     <p>'Poor Ethel! I condole with you.'</p>
     <p>'And I wonder at you!' said Ethel, 'especially as Flora and Mrs. Hoxton say it is all for
      your sake;' then, nettled by Margaret's laugh, 'such a nice occupation for her, poor thing, as
      if you were Mrs. Hoxton, and had no resource but fancy-work.'</p>
     <p>'You know I am base enough to be so amused,' said Margaret; 'but, seriously, Ethel dear, I
      cannot bear to see you so much hurt by it. I did not know you were really grieved.'</p>
     <p>'Grieved! I am ashamed—sickened!' cried Ethel, vehemently. 'Poor Cocksmoor! As soon as
      anything is done there, Flora must needs go about implying that we have set some grand work in
      hand, and want only means—'</p>
     <p>'Stop, Ethel; Flora does not boast.'</p>
     <p>'No, she does not boast. I wish she did! That would be straight-forward and simple; but she
      has too good taste for that—so she does worse—she tells a little, and makes that go a long
      way, as if she were keeping back a great deal! You don't know how furious it makes me!'</p>
     <p>'Ethel!'</p>
     <p>'So,' said Ethel, disregarding, 'she stirs up all Stoneborough to hear what the Miss Mays
      are doing at Cocksmoor. So the Ladies' Committee must needs have their finger in! Much they
      cared for the place when it was wild and neglected! But they go to inspect Cherry and her
      school—Mrs. Ledwich and all—and, back they come, shocked—no system, no order, the mistress
      untrained, the school too small, with no apparatus! They all run about in despair, as if we
      had ever asked them to help us. And so Mrs. Hoxton, who cares for poor children no more than
      for puppy-dogs, but who can't live without useless work, and has filled her house as full of
      it as it can hold, devises a bazaar—a field for her trumpery, and a shew-off for all the young
      ladies; and Flora treats it like an inspiration! Off they trot, to the old Assembly Rooms. I
      trusted that the smallness of them would have knocked it on the head; but, still worse,
      Flora's talking of it makes Mr. Rivers think it our pet scheme; so, what does he do but offer
      his park, and so we are to have a regular fancy fair, and Cocksmoor school will be founded in
      vanity and frivolity! But, I believe you like it!'</p>
     <p>'I am not sure of my own feeling, said Margaret. 'It has been settled without our
      interposition, and I have never been able
      <pb n="337"/> to talk it over calmly with you. Papa does not seem to disapprove.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Ethel. 'He <hi>will</hi> only laugh, and say it will spare him a great many of
      Mrs. Hoxton's nervous attacks. He thinks of it nearly as I do, at the bottom, but I cannot get
      him to stop it, nor even to say he does not wish Flora to sell.'</p>
     <p>'I did not understand that you really had such strong objections,' said Margaret. 'I thought
      it was only as a piece of folly, and—'</p>
     <p>'And interference with <hi>my</hi> Cocksmoor?' said Ethel. I had better own to what may be
      wrong personal feeling at first.'</p>
     <p>'I can hardly call it wrong,' said Margaret, tenderly, 'considering what Cocksmoor is to
      you, and what the Ladies' Committee is.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Margaret, if the lawful authority—if a good Clergyman would only come, how willingly
      would I work under him. But Mrs. Ledwich and—it is like having all the Spaniards and savages
      spoiling Robinson Crusoe's desert island!'</p>
     <p>'It is not come to that yet,' said Margaret; but, about the Fancy Fair. We all know that the
      school is very much wanted.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, but I hoped to wait in patience and perseverance, and do it at last.'</p>
     <p>'All yourself?'</p>
     <p>'Now Margaret! you know I was glad of Alan's help.'</p>
     <p>'I should <hi>think</hi> so!' said Margaret. 'You need not make a favour of that!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, but, don't you see, that came as almsgiving, in the way which brings a blessing. We
      want nothing to make us give money and work to Cocksmoor. We do all we can already; and I
      don't want to get a fine bag or a ridiculous pincushion in exchange!'</p>
     <p>'Not you, but—'</p>
     <p>'Well, for the rest. If they like to offer their money, well and good, the better for them;
      but why must they not give it to Cocksmoor —but for that unnatural butterfly of Blanche's,
      with black pins for horns, that they will go and sell at an extortionate rate.'</p>
     <p>'The price will be given for Cocksmoor's sake!'</p>
     <p>'Pooh! Margaret. Do you think it is for Cocksmoor's sake that Lady Leonora Langdale and her
      fine daughter come down from London? Would Mrs. Hoxton spend the time in making frocks for
      Cocksmoor children that she does in cutting out paper, and stuffing glass bottles with it? Let
      people be honest—alms, or pleasure, or vanity! let them say which they mean; but don't make
      charity the excuse for the others; and, above all, don't make my poor Cocksmoor the victim of
      it.'</p>
     <p>This is very severe,' said Margaret, pausing, almost confounded.
      <pb n="338"/> 'Do you think no charity worth having but what is given on unmixed motives? Who,
      then, could give?'</p>
     <p>'Margaret—we see much evil arise in the best-planned institutions; nay, in what are not
      human. Don't you think we ought to do our utmost to have no flaw in the foundation? Schools
      are not such perfect places that we can build them without fear, and, if the means are to be
      raised by a bargain for amusement—if they are to come from frivolity instead of selfdenial, I
      am afraid of them. I do not mean that Cocksmoor has not been the joy of my life, and of
      Mary's, but that was not because we did it for pleasure.'</p>
     <p>'No!' said Margaret, sighing, 'you found pleasure by the way. But why did you not say all
      this to Flora.'</p>
     <p>'It is of no use to talk to Flora,' said Ethel; 'she would say it was high-flown and
      visionary. Oh! she wants it for the bazaar's own sake, and that is one reason why I hate
      it.'</p>
     <p>'Now, Ethel!'</p>
     <p>'I do believe it was very unfortunate for Flora that the Hoxtons took to patronizing her,
      because Norman would not be patronized. Ever since it began, her mind has been full of
      visitings, and parties, and county families, and she has left off the home usefulness she used
      to care about.'</p>
     <p>'But you are old enough for that,' said Margaret. 'It would be hard to keep Flora at home,
      now that you can take her place, and do not care for going out. One of us must be the
      representative Miss May, you know, and keep up the civilities; and you may think yourself
      lucky it is not you.'</p>
     <p>'If it was only that, I should not care, but I may as well tell you, Margaret, for it is a
      weight to me. It is not the mere pleasure in gaieties—Flora cares for them, in themselves, as
      little as I do—nor is it neighbourliness, as a duty to others, for, you may observe, she
      always gets off any engagement to the Wards, or any of the town folk, to whom it would be a
      gratification to have her—she either eludes them, or sends me. The thing is, that she is
      always trying to be with the great people, the county set, and I don't think that is the safe
      way of going on.'</p>
     <p>Margaret mused sadly. 'You frighten me, Ethel! I cannot say it is not so, and these are so
      like the latent faults that dear mamma's letter spoke of—'</p>
     <p>Ethel sat meditating, and, at last, said, 'I wish I had not told you! I don't always believe
      it myself, and it is so unkind, and you will make yourself unhappy too. I ought not to have
      thought it of her! Think of her ever ready kindness and helpfulness; her pretty courteous ways
      to the very least; her obligingness and tact!'</p>
     <pb n="339"/>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret, 'she is one of the kindest people there is, and I am sure that she
      thought the gaining funds for Cocksmoor, was the best thing to be done, that you would be
      pleased, and a great deal of pleasant occupation provided for us all.'</p>
     <p>'That is the bright side, the surface side,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And not an untrue one,' said Margaret; 'Meta will not be vain, and will work the more
      happily for Cocksmoor's sake. Mary and Blanche, poor Mrs. Boulder, and many good ladies who
      hitherto have not known how to help Cocksmoor, will do so now with a good will, and though it
      is not what we should have chosen, I think we had better take it in good part.'</p>
     <p>'You think so?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, indeed I do. If you go about with that dismal face and strong disapproval, it will
      really seem as if it was the having your dominion meddled with that you dislike. Besides, it
      is putting yourself forward to censure what is not absolutely wrong in itself, and that cannot
      be desirable.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Ethel, 'but I cannot help being sorry for Cocksmoor. I thought patience would
      prepare the way, and the means be granted in good time, without hastiness—only
      earnestness.'</p>
     <p>'You had made a picture for yourself,' said Margaret, gently. 'Yes, we all make pictures for
      ourselves, and we are the foremost figures in them; but they are taken out of our hands, and
      we see others putting in rude touches, and spoiling our work, as it seems; but, by-and-by, we
      shall see that it is all guided.'</p>
     <p>Ethel sighed. 'Then having protested to my utmost against this concern, you think I ought to
      be amiable about it.'</p>
     <p>'And to let poor Mary enjoy it. She would be so happy, if you would not bewilder her by your
      gloomy looks, and keep her to the hemming of your endless glazed calico bonnet strings.'</p>
     <p>'Poor old Mary! I thought that was by her own desire.'</p>
     <p>'Only her dutiful allegiance to you; and, as making pincushions is nearly her greatest
      delight, it is cruel to make her think it, in some mysterious way, wrong and displeasing to
      you.'</p>
     <p>Ethel laughed, and said, 'I did not think Mary was in such awe of me. I'll set her free,
      then. But, Margaret, do you really think I ought to give up my time to it?'</p>
     <p>'Could you not just let them have a few drawings, or a little bit of your company work—just
      enough for you not to annoy everyone, and seem to be testifying against them. You would not
      like to vex Meta.'</p>
     <p>'It will go hard, if I do not tell Meta my mind. I cannot bear to see her deluded.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think she is,' said Margaret; 'but she does not set her
      <pb n="340"/> face against what others wish. As papa says of his dear little humming-bird, she
      takes the honey, and leaves the poison.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; amid all that enjoyment, she is always choosing the good, and leaving the evil; always
      sacrificing something, and then being happy in the sacrifice!'</p>
     <p>'No one would guess it was a sacrifice, it is so joyously done— least of all Meta
      herself.'</p>
     <p>'Her coming home from London was exactly a specimen of that sacrifice—and no sacrifice,'
      said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'What was that?' said Norman, who had come up to the window unobserved, and had been
      listening to their few last sentences.</p>
     <p>'Did not you hear of it? It was a sort of material turning away from vanity that made me
      respect the little rival Daisy, as much as I always admired her.</p>
     <p>'Tell me,' said Norman. 'When was it?'</p>
     <p>'Last spring. You know Mr. Rivers is always ill in London: indeed, papa says it would be the
      death of him; but Lady Leonora Langdale thinks it dreadful that Meta should not go to all the
      gaieties; and, last year, when Mrs. Larpent was gone, she insisted on her coming to stay with
      her for the season. Now, Meta thought it wrong to leave her father alone, and wanted not to
      have gone at all, but, to my surprise, Margaret advised her to yield, and go for some short
      fixed time.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret; 'as all her elders thought it right, I did not think we could advise
      her to refuse absolutely. Besides, it was a promise.'</p>
     <p>'She declared she would only stay three weeks, and the Langdales were satisfied, thinking
      that, once in London, they should keep her. They little knew Meta, with her pretty ways of
      pretending that her resolution is only spoilt-child wilfulness. None of you quite trusted her,
      did you Margaret? Even papa was almost afraid, though he wanted her very much to be at home;
      for poor Mr. Rivers was so low and forlorn without her, though he would not let her know,
      because Lady Leonora had persuaded him to think it was all for her good.'</p>
     <p>'What did they do with her in London?' asked Norman.</p>
     <p>'They did their utmost,' said Ethel. 'They made engagements for her, and took her to parties
      and concerts—those she did enjoy very much—and she had lessons in drawing and music, but
      whenever she wanted to see any exhibitions, or do anything, they always said there was time to
      spare. I believe it was very charming, and she would have been very glad to stay, but she
      never would promise, and she was always thinking of her positive duty at home. She seemed
      afterwards to think of her wishes to remain almost as if
      <pb n="341"/> they had been a sin; but she said—dear little Meta—that nothing had ever helped
      her so much as that she used to say to herself, whenever she was going out, "I renounce the
      world." It came to a crisis at last, when Lady Leonora wanted her to be presented— the
      drawing-room was after the end of her three weeks—and she held out against it; though her aunt
      laughed at her, and treated her as if she was a silly, shy child. At last, what do you think
      Meta did? She went to her uncle, Lord Cosham, and appealed to him to say whether there was the
      least necessity for her to go to court.'</p>
     <p>'Then she gained the day?' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'He was delighted with that spirited, yet coaxing way of hers, and admired her
      determination. He told papa so himself—for you must know, when he heard all Meta had to say,
      he called her a very good girl, and said he would take her home himself on the Saturday she
      had fixed, and spend Sunday at Abbotstoke. Oh! he was perfectly won by her sweet ways. Was not
      it lucky? for before this Lady Leonora had written to Mr. Rivers, and obtained from him a
      letter, which Meta had the next day, desiring her to stay for the Drawing-room. But Meta knew
      well enough how it was, and was not to be conquered that way; so she said she must go home to
      entertain her uncle, and that if her papa really wished it, she would return on Monday.'</p>
     <p>'Knowing well that Mr. Rivers would be only too glad to heep her.'</p>
     <p>'Just so. How happy they both did look, when they came in here on their way from the station
      where he had met her! How she danced in, and how she sparkled with glee!' said Margaret, 'and
      poor Mr. Rivers was quite tremulous with the joy of having her back, hardly able to keep from
      fondling her every minute, and coming again into the room after they had taken leave, to tell
      me that his little girl had preferred her home, and her poor old father, to all the pleasures
      in London. Oh! I was so glad they came! That was a sight that did one good! And then, I fancy
      Mr. Rivers is a wee bit afraid of his brother-in-law, for he begged papa and Flora to come
      home and dine with them, but Flora was engaged to Mrs. Hoxton.'</p>
     <p>'Ha! Flora!' said Norman, as if he rather enjoyed her losing something through her going to
      Mrs. Hoxton. 'I suppose she would have given the world to go!'</p>
     <p>'I was so sorry,' said Ethel, 'but I had to go instead, and it was delightful. Papa made
      great friends with Lord Cosham, while Mr. Rivers went to sleep after dinner, and I had such a
      delightful wandering with Meta, listening to the nightingales, and hearing all about it. I
      never knew Meta so well before.'</p>
     <pb n="342"/>
     <p>'And there was no more question of her going back?' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'No, indeed! She said, when her uncle asked in joke, on Monday morning, whether she had
      packed up to return with him, Mr. Rivers was quite nervously alarmed the first moment, lest
      she should intend it.'</p>
     <p>'That little Meta,' said Margaret. 'Her wishes for substantial use have been pretty well
      realized!'</p>
     <p>'Um!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'What do you mean?' said Norman, sharply. 'I should call her present position the perfection
      of feminine usefulness.'</p>
     <p>'So perhaps it is,' said Ethel; 'but though she does it beautifully, and is very valuable;
      to be the mistress of a great luxurious house, like that, does not seem to me the subject of
      aspirations like Meta's.'</p>
     <p>'Think of the contrast with what she used to be,' said Margaret, gently, 'the pretty,
      gentle, playful toy that her father brought her up to be, living a life of mere
      accomplishments and self indulgence; kind certainly, but never so as to endure any
      disagreeables, or make any exertion. But as soon as she entered into the true spirit of our
      calling, did she not begin to seek to live the sterner life, and train herself in duty? The
      quiet way she took always seemed to me the great beauty of it. She makes duties of her
      accomplishments by making them loving obedience to her father.'</p>
     <p>'Not that they are not pleasant to her?' interposed Norman.</p>
     <p>'Certainly,' said Margaret, 'but it gives them the zest, and confidence that they are right,
      which one could not have in such things merely for one's own amusement.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, 'she does more; she told me one day that one reason she liked sketching
      was, that looking into nature always made Psalms and Hymns sing in her ears, and so with her
      music and her beautiful copies from the old Italian devotional pictures. She says our papa
      taught her to look at them so as to see more than the mere art and beauty.'</p>
     <p>'Think how diligently she measures out her day,' said Margaret; 'getting up early, to be
      sure of time for reading her serious books, and working hard at her tough studies.'</p>
     <p>'And what I care for still more,' said Ethel, 'her being bent on learning plain needlework
      and doing it for her poor people. She is so useful amongst the cottagers at Abbotstoke!'</p>
     <p>'And a famous little mistress of the house,' added Margaret. 'When the old housekeeper went
      away two years ago, she thought she ought to know something about the government of the house;
      so she asked me about it, and proposed to her father that the new
      <pb n="343"/> one should come to her for orders, and that she should pay the wages and have
      the accounts in her hands. Mr. Rivers thought it was only a freak, but she has gone on
      steadily; and I assure you, she has had some difficulties, for she has come to me about them.
      Perhaps Ethel does not believe in them?'</p>
     <p>'No, I was only thinking how I should hate ordering those fanciful dinners for Mr. Rivers. I
      know what you mean, and how she had difficulties about sending the maids to Church, and in
      dealing with the cook who did harm to the other servants, and yet sent up dinners that he
      liked, and how puzzled she was how to avoid annoying him. Oh! she has got into a peck of
      troubles by making herself manager.'</p>
     <p>'And had she not been the Meta she is, she would either have fretted, or thrown it all up,
      instead of humming briskly through all. She never was afraid to speak to anyone,' said
      Margaret, 'that is one thing; I believe every difficulty makes the spirit bound higher, till
      she springs over it, and finds it, as she says, only a pleasure.'</p>
     <p>'She need not be afraid to speak,' said Ethel, 'for she always does it well and winningly. I
      have seen her give a reproof in so firm and kind a way, and so bright in the instant of
      forgiveness.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Margaret, 'she does those disagreeable things as well as Flora does in her
      way.'</p>
     <p>'And yet,' said Ethel, 'doing things well does not seem to be a snare to her.'</p>
     <p>'Because,' whispered Margaret, 'she fulfils more than almost anyone —the—"Whatsoever ye do,
      do all to the glory of God."'</p>
     <p>'Do you know,' said Norman, suddenly, the derivation of Margarita?'</p>
     <p>'No further than those two pretty meanings, the pearl and the daisy,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'It is from the Persian Mervarid, child of light,' said Norman; and, with a sudden flush of
      colour, he returned to the garden.</p>
     <p>'A fit meaning for one whole carries sunshine with her,' said Margaret. 'I feel in better
      tune, for a whole day, after her bright eyes have been smiling on me.'</p>
     <p>'You want no one to put you in tune,' said Ethel, fondly—'you, our own pearl of light.'</p>
     <p>'No, call me only an old faded daisy,' said Margaret, sadly.</p>
     <p>'Not a bit, only our moon, <hi>la gran Margarita</hi> ,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I hear the real Daisy coming!' exclaimed Margaret, her face lighting up with pleasure as
      the two youngest children entered, and indeed, little Gertrude's golden hair, round open face,
      fresh red and white complexion, and innocent looks, had so much likeness to the flower, as to
      promote the use of the pet name, though protests were
      <pb n="344"/> often made in favour of her proper appellation. Her temper was daisy-like too,
      serene and loving, and able to bear a great deal of spoiling, and resolve as they might, who
      was not her slave?</p>
     <p>Miss Winter no longer ruled the school-room. Her sway had been brought to a happy conclusion
      by a proposal from a widowed sister to keep house with her; and Ethel had reason to rejoice
      that Margaret had kept her submissive under authority, which, if not always judicious, was
      both kind and conscientious.</p>
     <p>Upon the change, Ethel had thought that the lessons could easily be managed by herself and
      Flora; while Flora was very anxious for a finishing governess, who might impart singing to
      herself, graces to Ethel, and accomplishments to Mary and Blanche.</p>
     <p>Dr. May, however, took them both by surprise. He met with a family of orphans, the eldest of
      whom had been qualifying herself for a governess, and needed nothing but age and finish; and
      in ten minutes after the project had been conceived, he had begun to put it in execution, in
      spite of Flora's prudent demurs.</p>
     <p>Miss Bracy was a gentle, pleasing young person, pretty to look at, with her soft olive
      complexion, and languid pensive eyes, obliging and intelligent; and the change from the dry,
      authoritative Miss Winter, was so delightful, that unedifying contrasts were continually being
      drawn. Blanche struck up a great friendship for her at once, Mary, always docile, ceased to be
      piteous at her lessons, and Ethel moralised on the satisfaction of having sympathy needed
      instead of repelled, and did her utmost to make Miss Bracy feel at home—and like a friend—in
      her new position.</p>
     <p>For herself, Ethel had drawn up a beautiful time-table, with all her pursuits and duties
      most carefully balanced, after the pattern of that which Margaret Rivers had made by her
      advice, on the departure of Mrs. Larpent, who had been called away by the ill-health of her
      son. Meta had adhered to hers in an exemplary manner, but she was her own mistress in a manner
      that could hardly be the lot of one of a large family.</p>
     <p>Margaret had become subject to languor and palpitations, and the headship of the household
      had fallen entirely upon Flora, who, on the other hand, was a person of multifarious
      occupations, and always had a great number of letters to write, or songs to copy and practise,
      which, together with her frequent visits to Mrs. Hoxton, made her glad to devolve, as much as
      she could, upon her younger sister; and, "O Ethel, you will not mind just doing this for me,"
      was said often enough to be a tax upon her time.</p>
     <p>Moreover, Ethel perceived that Aubrey's lessons were in an unsatisfactory state. Margaret
      could not always attend to them, and suffered from them when she did; and he was bandied about
      <pb n="345"/> between his sisters and Miss Bracy in a manner that made him neither attentive
      nor obedient.</p>
     <p>On her own principle, that to embrace a task heartily, renders it no longer irksome, she
      called on herself to sacrifice her studies and her regularity as far as was needful, to make
      her available for home requirements. She made herself responsible for Aubrey, and, after a few
      battles with his desultory habits, made him a very promising pupil, inspiring so much of
      herself into him, that he was, if anything, overfull of her classical tastes. In fact, he had
      such an appetite for books, and dealt so much in precocious wisdom, that his father was heard
      to say, "Six years old! It is a comfort that he will soon forget the whole."</p>
     <p>Gertrude was also Ethel's pupil, but learning was not at all in her line; and the sight of
      "Cobwebs to Catch Flies," or of the venerated "Little Charles," were the most serious clouds,
      that made the Daisy pucker up her face, and infuse a whine into her voice.</p>
     <p>However, to-day, as usual, she was half dragged, half coaxed, through her day's portion of
      the discipline of life, and then sent up for her sleep, while Aubrey's two hours were spent in
      more agreeable work, such as Margaret could not but enjoy hearing—so spirited was Ethel's mode
      of teaching—so eager was her scholar.</p>
     <p>His play afterwards consisted in fighting o'er again the siege of Troy on the floor, with
      wooden bricks, shells, and the survivors of a Noah's ark, while Ethel read to Margaret until
      Gertrude's descent from the nursery, when the only means of preventing a dire confusion in
      Aubrey's camp was, for her elder sisters to become her playfellows, and so spare Aubrey's
      temper Ethel good-humouredly gave her own time, till their little tyrant trotted out to make
      Norman carry her round the garden on his back!</p>
     <p>So sped the morning till Flora came home, full of the intended bazaar, and Ethel would fain
      have taken refuge in puzzling out her Spanish, had she not remembered her recent promise to be
      gracious.</p>
     <p>The matter had been much as she had described it. Flora had a way of hinting at anything she
      thought creditable, and thus the Stoneborough public had become aware of the exertions of the
      May family on behalf of Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>The plan of a Fancy Fair was started. Mrs. Hoxton became more interested than was her wont;
      and Flora was enchanted at the opening it gave for promoting the welfare of the forlorn
      district. She held a position which made her hope to direct the whole. As she had once
      declared, with truth, it only had depended on them selves, whether she and her sisters should
      sink to the level of the Andersons, and their set, or belong to the county society; and her
      <pb n="346"/> tact had resulted in her being decidedly—as the little dress-maker's apprentice
      amused Ethel by saying—"One of our most distinguished patronesses"—a name that had stuck by
      her ever since.</p>
     <p>Margaret looked on passively, inclined to admire Flora in everything, yet now and then
      puzzled; and her father, in his simplehearted way, felt only gratitude and exultation in the
      kindness that his daughter met with. As to the bazaar, if it had been started in his own
      family, he might have weighed the objections, but, as it was not his daughters own concern, he
      did not trouble himself about it, only regarding it as one of the many vagaries of the ladies
      of Stoneborough.</p>
     <p>So the scheme had been further developed, till now Flora came in with much to tell. The
      number of stalls had been finally fixed. Mrs. Hoxton undertook one, with Flora as an
      aid-de-camp, and some nieces to assist; Lady Leonora was to <hi>chaperon</hi> Miss Rivers; and
      a third, to Flora's regret, had been allotted to Miss Cleveland, a good-natured, merry,
      elderly heiress, who would, Flora feared, bring on them the whole "Stoneborough crew." And
      then she began to reckon up the present resources—drawings, bags, and pincushions. 'That chip
      hat you plaited for Daisy, Margaret, you must let us have that. It will be lovely, trimmed
      with pink.'</p>
     <p>'Do you wish for this?' said Ethel, heaving up a grim mass of knitting.</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Flora; 'so ornamental, especially the original performance in the corner,
      which you would perpetrate, in spite of my best efforts.'</p>
     <p>'I shall not be offended, if you despise it. I only thought you might have no more scruple
      in robbing Granny Hall, than in robbing Daisy.'</p>
     <p>'Pray send it. Papa will buy it as your unique performance.'</p>
     <p>'No; you shall tell me what I am to do.'</p>
     <p>'Does she mean it?' said Flora, turning to Margaret. 'Have you converted her? Well done!
      Then, Ethel, we will get some pretty <hi>batiste</hi> , and you and Mary shall make some of
      those nice sun-bonnets, which you really do to perfection.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you. That is a more respectable task than I expected. People may have something worth
      buying,' said Ethel, who, like all the world, felt the influence of Flora's tact.</p>
     <p>'I mean to study the useful,' said Flora. 'The Cleveland set will be sure to deal in
      frippery, and I have been looking over Mrs. Hoxton's stores, where I see quite enough for mere
      decoration. There are two splendid vases in potichomanie, in an Etruscan pattern, which are
      coming for me to finish.</p>
     <p>'Mrs. Taylor, at Cocksmoor, could do that for you,' said Ethel.
      <pb n="347"/> 'Her two phials, stuffed with chintz patterns and flour, are quite as original
      and tasteful.'</p>
     <p>'Silly work,' said Flora, 'but it makes a fair show.'</p>
     <p>'The essence of Vanity Fair,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'It won't do to be satirical over much,' said Flora. 'You won't get on without humouring
      your neighbours' follies.'</p>
     <p>'I don't want to get on.'</p>
     <p>'But you want—or, at least, I want—Cocksmoor to get on.'</p>
     <p>Ethel saw Margaret looking distressed, and, recalling her resolution, she said, 'Well,
      Flora, I dont mean to say any more about it. I see it can't be helped, and you all think you
      intend it for good; so there's an end of the matter, and I'll do anything for you in
      reason.'</p>
     <p>'Poor old King Ethel!' said Flora, smiling in an elder-sisterly manner. 'You will see, my
      dear, your views are very pretty, but very impracticable, and it is a work-a-day world after
      all—even papa would tell you so. When Cocksmoor school is built, then you may thank me. I do
      not look for it before.'</p>

     <p>Etheldred had not answered her sister, but she did not feel at all secure that she
      should have anything to be thankful for, even if the school were built.</p>
     <p>The invasion of Cocksmoor was not only interference with her own field of action, but it was
      dangerous to the improvement of her scholars. Since the departure of Mr. Wilmot, matters at
      Stoneborough National School had not improved, though the Miss Andersons talked a great deal
      about progress, science, and lectures.</p>
     <p>The Ladies' Committee were constantly at war with the mistresses, and that one was a veteran
      who endured them, or whom they could
      <pb n="348"/> endure beyond her first half-year. No mistress had staid a year within the
      memory of any girl now at school. Perpetual change prevented any real education, and, as each
      lady held different opinions and proscribed all books not agreeing thereto, everything
      "dogmatical" was excluded; and, as Ethel said, the children learnt nothing but facts about
      lions and steam-engines, while their doctrine varied with that of the visitor for the week. If
      the ten generals could only have given up to Miltiades, but alas! there was no Miltiades. Mr.
      Ramsden's health was failing, and his neglect told upon the parish in the dreadful evils
      reigning unchecked, and engulfing many a child whom more influential teaching might have
      saved. Mental arithmetic, and the rivers of Africa, had little power to strengthen the soul
      against temptation.</p>
     <p>The scanty attendance at the National School attested the indifference with which it was
      regarded, and the borderers voluntarily patronized Cherry Elwood, and thus had, perhaps, first
      aroused the emulation that led Mrs. Ledwich on a visit of inspection, to what she chose to
      consider as an offshoot of the National School.</p>
     <p>The next day, she called upon the Miss Mays. It was well that Ethel was not at home.
      Margaret received the lady's horrors at the sight of the mere crowded cottage kitchen, the
      stupid untrained mistress, without an idea of method, and that impertinent woman, her mother!
      Miss Flora and Miss Ethel must have had a great deal to undergo, and she would lose no time in
      convening the Ladies' Committee, and appointing a successor to "that Elwood," as soon as a fit
      room could be erected for her use. If Margaret had not known that Mrs. Ledwich sometimes
      threatened more than she could accomplish, she would have been in despair. She tried to say a
      good word for Cherry, but was talked down, and had reason to believe that Mrs. Elwood had
      mortally offended Mrs. Ledwich.</p>
     <p>The sisters had heard the other side of the story at Cocksmoor. Mrs. Elwood would not let
      them enter the school, till she had heard how that there Mrs. Ledwich had come in, and treated
      them all as if it was her own place—how she had found fault with Cherry before all the
      children, and, as good as said, she was not fit to keep a school. She had even laid hands on
      one of the books, and said that she should take it home, and see whether it were a fit one for
      them to use; whereupon Mrs. Elwood had burst out in defence— it was Miss Ethel May's book, and
      should not be taken away— it was Miss Ethel as she looked to—and when it seemed that Mrs.
      Ledwich had said something disparaging of Miss Ethel, either as to youth, judgment, or
      doctrine, Mrs. Elwood had fired up into a declaration that 'Miss Ethel was a real lady—that
      she was! and that no real lady would ever come prying into other folk's work,
      <pb n="349"/> and finding fault with what wasn't no business of theirs,' with more of a
      personal nature, which Flora could not help enjoying, even while she regretted it.</p>
     <p>Cherry was only too meek, as her mother declared. She had said not a word, except in quiet
      reply, and being equally terrified by the attack and defence, had probably seemed more dull
      than was her wont. Her real feelings did not appear till the next Sunday, when, in her
      peaceful conference with Margaret, far from the sound of storms, she expressed that she well
      knew that she was a poor scholar, and that she hoped the young ladies would not let her stand
      in the children's light, when a better teacher could be found for them.</p>
     <p>'I am sure!' cried Ethel, as she heard of this, 'it would be hard to find such a teacher in
      humility! Cherry bears it so much better than I, that it is a continual reproof!'</p>
     <p>As to the dullness, against which Ethel used to rail, the attacks upon it had made her erect
      it into a positive merit; she was always comparing the truth, honesty, and respectful
      demeanour of Cherry's scholars, with the notorious faults of the National-school girls, as if
      these defects had been implanted either by Mrs. Ledwich, or by geography. It must be confessed
      that the violence of partisanship did not make her a pleasant companion.</p>
     <p>However, the interest of the bazaar began somewhat to divert the current of the ladies'
      thoughts, and Ethel found herself walking day after day to Cocksmoor, unmolested by further
      reports of Mrs. Ledwich's proceedings. Richard was absent, preparing for Ordination, but
      Norman had just returned home for the Long Vacation, and, rather than lose the chance of a
      conversation with her, had joined her and Mary in a walk to Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>His talk was chiefly of Settlesham, old Mr. Wilmot's parish, where he had been making a
      visit to his former tutor, and talking over the removal to Eton of Tom, who had well responded
      to the care taken of him, and with his good principles confirmed, and his character
      strengthened, might be, with less danger, exposed to trial.</p>
     <p>It had been a visit such as to leave a deep impression on Norman's mind. Sixty years ago,
      old Mr. Wilmot had been what he now was himself—an enthusiastic and distinguished Balliol man,
      and he had kept up a warm, clear-sighted interest in Oxford, throughout his long life. His
      anecdotes, his recollections, and comments on present opinions had been listened to with great
      eagerness, and Norman had felt it an infinite honour to give the venerable old man his arm, as
      to be shown by him his curious collection of books. His parish, carefully watched for so many
      years, had been a study not lost upon Norman, who detailed particulars of the doings there,
      <pb n="350"/> which made Ethel sigh to think of the contrast with Stoneborough. —In such
      conversation they came to the entrance of the hamlet, and Mary, with a scream of joy, declared
      that she really believed that he was going to help them! He did not turn away.</p>
     <p>'Thank you!' said Ethel, in a low voice, from the bottom of her heart.</p>
     <p>She used him mercifully, and made the lessons shorter than usual, but when they reached the
      open air again, he drew a long breath; and when Mary eagerly tried for a compliment to their
      scholars, asked if they could not be taught the use of eyelids.</p>
     <p>'Did they stare?' said Ethel. 'That's one advantage of being blind. No one can stare me out
      of countenance.'</p>
     <p>'Why were you answering all your questions yourself?' asked Mary.</p>
     <p>'Because no one else would,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'You used such hard words,' replied Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Indeed! I thought I was very simple.'</p>
     <p>'O! cried Mary, there were derive, and instruction, and implicate, and—oh, so many.'</p>
     <p>'Never mind,' said Ethel, seeing him disconcerted. 'It is better for them to be drawn up,
      and you will soon learn their language. If we only had Una M'Carthy here!'</p>
     <p>'Then you don't like it?' said Mary, disappointed.</p>
     <p>'It is time to learn not to be fastidious,' he answered. 'So, if you will help me—'</p>
     <p>'Norman, I am so glad!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman, 'I see now that these things that puff us up, and seem the whole world
      to us now, all end in nothing but such as this! Think of old Mr. Wilmot, once carrying all
      before him, but deeming all his powers well bestowed in fifty years' teaching of clowns!'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' replied Ethel, very low. 'One soul is worth—' and she paused from the fullness of
      thought.</p>
     <p>'And these things, about which we are so elated, do not render us so fit to teach—as you,
      Mary, or as Richard.'</p>
     <p>'They do,' said Ethel. The ten talents were doubled. Strength tells in power. The more
      learning, the fitter to teach the simplest thing.'</p>
     <p>'You remind me of old Mr. Wilmot, saying that the first thing he learnt at his parish was,
      how little his people knew; the second, how little he himself knew.'</p>
     <p>So Norman persevered in the homely discipline that he had chosen for himself, which brought
      out his deficiency in practical work in a manner which lowered him in his own eyes, to a
      degree almost
      <pb n="351"/> satisfactory to himself. He was not, indeed, without humility, but his nature
      was self-contemplative and self-conscious enough to perceive his superiority of talent, and it
      had been the struggle of his life to abase this perception, so that it was actually a relief
      not to be obliged to fight with his own complacency in his powers. He had learnt not to think
      too highly of himself—he had yet to learn to "think soberly." His aid was Ethel's chief
      pleasure through this somewhat trying summer, it might be her last peaceful one at
      Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>That bazaar! How wild it had driven the whole town, and even her own home!</p>
     <p>Margaret herself, between good-nature and feminine love of pretty things, had become ardent
      in the cause. In her unvaried life, it was a great amusement to have so many bright elegant
      things exhibited to her, and Ethel was often mortified to find her excited about some new
      device, or drawn off from "rational employments," to complete some trifle.</p>
     <p>Mary and Blanche were far worse. From the time that consent had been given to the fancy-work
      being carried on in the school-room, all interest in study was over. Thenceforth, lessons were
      a necessary form, gone through without heart or diligence. These were reserved for paste-board
      boxes, beplastered with rice and sealing-wax, for alum-baskets, dressed dolls, and every
      conceivable trumpery; and the governess was as eager as the scholars.</p>
     <p>If Ethel remonstrated, she hurt Miss Bracy's feelings, and this was a very serious matter to
      both parties.</p>
     <p>The governess was one of those morbidly sensitive people, who cannot be stopped when once
      they have begun arguing that they are injured. Two women together, each with the last-word
      instinct, have no power to cease; and, when the words are spent in explaining —not in
      scolding—conscience is not called in to silence them, and nothing but dinner, or a
      thunder-storm can check them. All Ethel's good sense was of no avail; she could not stop Miss
      Bracy, and, though she might resolve within herself that real kindness would be to make one
      reasonable reply, and then quit the subject, yet, on each individual occasion, such a measure
      would have seemed mere impatience and cruelty. She found that if Miss Winter had been too dry,
      Miss Bracy went to the other extreme, and demanded a manifestation of sympathy, and return to
      her passionate attachment that perplexed Ethel's undemonstrative nature. Poor good Miss Bracy,
      she little imagined how often she added to the worries of her dear Miss Ethel, all for want of
      self-command.</p>
     <p>Finally, as the lessons were less and less attended to, and the needs of the stall became
      more urgent, Dr. May and Margaret
      <pb n="352"/> concurred in a decision, that it was better to yield to the mania, and give up
      the studies till they could be pursued with a willing mind.</p>
     <p>Ethel submitted, and only laughed with Norman at the display of treasures, which the girls
      went over daily, like the "House that Jack built," always starting from 'the box that Mary
      made.' Come when Dr. May would into the drawing-room, there was always a line of penwipers
      laid out on the floor, bags pendant to all the table-drawers, anti-macassars laid out
      everywhere.</p>
     <p>Ethel hoped that the holidays would create a diversion, but Mary was too old to be made into
      a boy, and Blanche drew Hector over to the feminine party, setting him to gum, gild, and paste
      all the contrivances which, in their hands, were mere feeble gimcracks, but which now became
      fairly sound, or, at least, saleable.</p>
     <p>The boys also constructed a beautiful little ship from a print of the Alcestis, so
      successfully, that the Doctor promised to buy it; and Ethel grudged the very sight of it to
      the bazaar.</p>
     <p>Tom, who, in person, was growing like a little shadow or model of Norman, had, unlike him, a
      very dextrous pair of hands, and made himself extremely useful in all such works. On the other
      hand, the Cleveland stall seemed chiefly to rely for brilliance on the wit of Harvey Anderson,
      who was prospering at his College, and the pride of his family. A great talker, and extremely
      gallant, he was considered a far greater acquisition to a Stoneborough drawing-room, than was
      the silent bashful Norman May, and rather looked down on his brother Edward, who, having gone
      steadily through the school, was in the attorney's office, and went on quietly and well,
      colouring up gratefully whenever one of the May family said a kind word to him.</p>

     <p>'This one day, and it will be over! and we shall be rational again!' thought
      Ethel, as she awoke.</p>
     <p>Flora was sleeping at the Grange, to be ready for action in the morning, and Ethel was to go
      early with Mary and Blanche, who
      <pb n="353"/> were frantic to have a share in the selling. Norman and the boys were to walk at
      their own time, and the children to be brought later by Miss Bracy. The Doctor would be bound
      by no rules.</p>
     <p>It was a pattern day, bright, clear, warm, and not oppressive, perfect for an out-of-doors
       <hi>fète</hi> ; and Ethel had made up her mind to fulfil her promise to Margaret of enjoying
      herself. In the brilliant sunshine, and between two such happy sisters, it would have been
      surly, indeed, not to enter into the spirit of the day; and Ethel laughed gaily with them, and
      at their schemes and hopes; Blanche's heart being especially set on knowing the fate of a
      watch-guard of her own construction.</p>
     <p>Hearing that the ladies were in the gardens, they repaired thither at once. The broad,
      smooth bowling-green lay before them; a marquee, almost converted into a bower, bounding it on
      either side, while, in the midst arose, gorgeous and delicious, a pyramid of
      flowers—contributions from all the hot-houses in the neighbourhood —to be sold for the benefit
      of the bazaar. Their freshness and fragrance gave a brightness to the whole scene, while
      shrinking from such light, as only the beauteous works of nature could bear, was the array
      accomplished by female fingers.</p>
     <p>Under the wreathed canopies were the stalls, piled up with bright colours, most artistically
      arranged. Ethel, with her over minute knowledge of every article, could hardly believe that
      yonder glowing Eastern pattern of scarlet, black and blue, was, in fact, a judicious mosaic of
      penwipers that she remembered, as shreds begged from the tailor, that the delicate lace-work
      consisted of Miss Bracey's perpetual anti-macassars, and that the potichomanie could look so
      dignified and Etruscan.</p>
     <p>'Here you are!' cried Meta Rivers, springing to meet them. 'Good girls, to come early.
      Where's my little Daisy?'</p>
     <p>'Coming in good time,' said Ethel. 'How pretty it all looks!'</p>
     <p>'But where's Flora—where's my watch-guard,' anxiously asked Blanche.</p>
     <p>'She was here just now,' said Meta, looking round. 'What a genius she is, Ethel! She worked
      wonders all yesterday, and let the Miss Hoxtons think it was all their own doing, and she was
      out before six this morning, putting finishing touches.'</p>
     <p>'Is this your stall?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes, but it will not bear a comparison with hers. It has a lady's-maid-look by the side of
      hers. In fact, Bellairs and my aunt's maid did it chiefly, for papa was rather ailing
      yesterday, and I could not be out much.</p>
     <p>'How is he now?'</p>
     <pb n="354"/>
     <p>'Better; he will walk round by-and-by. I hope it will not be too much for him.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! what beautiful <hi>things!</hi> ' cried Mary, in ecstasy, at what she was forced to
      express by the vague substantive, for her imagination had never stretched to the marvels she
      beheld.</p>
     <p>'Aye! we have been lazy, you see, and so Aunt Leonora brought down all these smart concerns.
      It is rather like Howell and James's, isn't it?'</p>
     <p>In fact, Lady Leonora's marquee was filled with costly knick-knacks, which, as Meta justly
      said, had not half the grace and appropriate air that reigned where Flora had arranged, and
      where Margaret had worked, with the peculiar freshness and finish that distinguished
      everything to which she set her hand.</p>
     <p>Miss Cleveland's counter was not ill set-out, but it wanted the air of ease and simplicity,
      which was even more noticeable than the perfect taste of Flora's wares. If there had been
      nothing facetious, the effect would have been better, but there was nothing to regret, and the
      whole was very bright and gay.</p>
     <p>Blanche could hardly look; so anxious was she for Flora, to tell her the locality of her
      treasure.</p>
     <p>'There she is,' said Meta, at last. 'George is fixing that branch of evergreen for her.'</p>
     <p>'Flora! I did not know her,' cried each sister amazed, while Mary added, 'Oh! how nice she
      looks.'</p>
     <p>It was the first time of seeing her in the white muslin, and broad chip-hat—which all the
      younger saleswomen of the bazaar had agreed to wear. It was a most becoming dress, and she
      did, indeed, look strikingly elegant, and well dressed. It occurred to Ethel, for the first
      time, that Flora was decidedly the reigning beauty of the bazaar—no one but Meta Rivers could
      be compared to her, and that little lady was on so small a scale of perfect finish, that she
      seemed fit to act the fairy, where Flora was the enchanted princess.</p>
     <p>Flora greeted her sisters eagerly, while Meta introduced her brother—a great contrast to
      herself, though not without a certain comeliness, tall and large, with ruddy complexion, deep
      lustreless black eyes, and a heavy straight bush of black moustache, veiling rather thick
      lips. Blanche reiterated enquiries for her watch-guard.</p>
     <p>'I don't know,' said Flora. 'Somewhere among the rest.'</p>
     <p>Blanche was in despair.</p>
     <p>'You may look for it,' said Flora—who, however hurried, never failed in kindness—'if you
      will touch nothing.'</p>
     <p>So Blanche ran from place to place in restless dismay, that caused Mr. George Rivers to ask
      what was the matter.</p>
     <pb n="355"/>
     <p>'The guards! the guards!' cried Blanche; whereupon he fell into a fit of laughter, which
      disconcerted her, because she could not understand him, and made Ethel take an aversion to him
      on the spot.</p>
     <p>However, he was very good-natured; he took Blanche's reluctant hand, and conducted her all
      along the stall, even proceeding to lift her up where she could not command a view of the
      whole, thus exciting her extreme indignation. She shook herself out when he set her down,
      surveyed her crumpled muslin, and believed he took her for a <hi>little</hi> girl! She ought
      to have been flattered when the quest was successful, and he insisted on knowing which was
       <hi>the</hi> guard, and declared that he should buy it. She begged him to do no such thing,
      and he desired to know why—insisting that he would give five shillings—fifteen—twenty-five for
      that one! till she did not know whether he was in earnest, and she doing an injury to the
      bazaar!</p>
     <p>Meantime, the hour had struck, and Flora had placed Mrs. Hoxton in a sheltered-spot, where
      she could take as much, or as little trouble, as she pleased. Lady Leonora, and Miss Langdale,
      came from the house, and, with the two ladies-maids in the back-ground, took up their station
      with Miss Rivers. Miss Cleveland called her party to order, and sounds of carriages were heard
      approaching.</p>
     <p>Mary and Blanche disbursed the first money spent in the "Fancy Fair;" Mary, on a
      blotting-book for Harry, to be placed among the presents, to which she added on every
      birthday, while Blanche bought a sixpenny gift for everyone, with more attention to the
      quantity than the quality. Then came a revival of her anxieties for the guards, and while Mary
      was simply desirous of the fun of being a shopwoman, and was made happy by Meta Rivers asking
      her help, Blanche was in despair, till she had sidled up to their neighbourhood, and her
      piteous looks had caused good-natured Mrs. Hoxton to invite her to assist, when she placed
      herself close to the precious object.</p>
     <p>A great fluttering of heart went to that manoeuvre, but still felicity could not be
      complete. That great troublesome Mr. George Rivers, had actually threatened to buy nothing but
      that one watch-chain, and Blanche's eye followed him everywhere with fear, lest he should come
      that way. And there were many other gentlemen— what could they want but watch-guards, and of
      them—what—save this paragon?</p>
     <p>Poor Blanche; what did she not undergo whenever any one cast his eye over her range of
      goods? and this was not seldom, for there was an attraction in the pretty little eager girl,
      glowing and smiling. One old gentleman actually stopped, handled the guards themselves, and
      asked their price.</p>
     <pb n="356"/>
     <p>'Eighteen-pence,' said Blanche, colouring and faltering, as she held up one in
      preference.</p>
     <p>'Eh! is not this the best?' said he, to the lady on his arm.</p>
     <p>'Oh! please, take that instead?' exclaimed Blanche, in extremity.</p>
     <p>'And why?' asked the gentleman, amused.</p>
     <p>'I made this,' she answered.</p>
     <p>'Is that the reason I must not have it?'</p>
     <p>'No, don't teaze her,' the lady said, kindly; and the other was taken.</p>
     <p>'I wonder for what it is reserved!' the lady could not help saying, as she walked away.</p>
     <p>'Let us watch her for a minute or two. What an embellishment children are! Ha! don't you
      see—the little maid is fluttering and reddening now! How pretty she looks! Ah! I see! here's
      the favoured! Don't you see that fine bronzed lad—Eton—one can see at a glance! It is a little
      drama. They are pretending to be strangers. He is turning over the goods with an air, she
      trying to look equally careless, but what a pretty carnation it is! Ha! ha! he has come to
      it—he has it! Now the acting is over, and they are having their laugh out! How joyously! What
      next! Oh! she begs off from keeping shop—she darts out to him, goes off in his hand—I declare
      that is the prettiest sight in the whole fair! I wonder who the little demoiselle can be?'</p>
     <p>The great event of the day was over now with Blanche, and she greatly enjoyed wandering
      about with Hector and Tom. There was a post-office at Miss Cleveland's stall, where, on paying
      sixpence, a letter could be obtained to the address of the inquirer. Blanche had been very
      anxious to try, but Flora had pronounced it nonsense; however, Hector declared that Flora was
      not his master, tapped at the sliding panel, and charmed Blanche by what she thought a most
      witty parody of his name as Achilles Lionsrock, Esquire. When the answer came from within,
      "Ship letter, sir, double postage," they thought it almost uncanny; and Hector's shilling was
      requited by something so like a real ship letter, that they had some idea that the real post
      had somehow transported itself thither. The interior was decidedly oracular, consisting of
      this one line, 'I counsel you to persevere in your laudable undertaking.'</p>
     <p>Hector said he wished he had any laudable undertaking, and Blanche tried to persuade Tom to
      try his fortune, but he pronounced that he did not care to hear Harvey Anderson's trash—he
      knew his writing, though disguised, and had detected his shining boots below the counter.
      There Mr. George Rivers came up, and began to teaze Blanche about the guards, asking her to
      take his fifteen shillings— or five-and-twenty, and who had got that <hi>one</hi> , which
      alone he
      <pb n="357"/> wanted; till the poor child, after standing perplexed for some moments, looked
      up with spirit, and said, "You have no business to ask," and, running away, took refuge in the
      back of Mrs. Hoxton's marquee, where she found Ethel packing up for Miss Hoxton's purchasers,
      and confiding to her that Mr. George Rivers was a horrid man, she ventured no more from her
      protection. She did, indeed, emerge, when told that papa was coming with Aubrey and Daisy, and
      Miss Bracy, and she had the pleasure of selling to them some of her wares, Dr. May bargaining
      with her to her infinite satisfaction; and little Gertrude's blue eyes opened to their full
      width, not understanding what could have befallen her sisters.</p>
     <p>'And what is Ethel doing?' asked the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'Packing up parcels, papa,' and Ethel's face was raised, looking very merry.</p>
     <p>'Packing parcels! How long will they last tied up?' said Dr. May, laughing.</p>
     <p>'Lasting is the concern of nothing in the fair, papa' answered she, in the same tone.</p>
     <p>For Ethel was noted as the worst packer in the house; but, having offered to wrap up a
      pincushion, sold by a hurried Miss Hoxton, she became involved in the office for the rest of
      the day—the same which Bellairs and her companion performed at the Langdale counter. Flora was
      too ready and dextrous to need any such aid, but the Miss Hoxtons were glad to be spared the
      trouble; and Blanche, whose fingers were far neater than Ethel's, made the task much easier,
      and was kept constant to it by her dread of the dark moustache, which was often visible near
      their tent, searching, she thought, for her.</p>
     <p>Their humble employment was no sinecure; for this was the favourite stall with the
      purchasers of better style, since the articles were, in general, tasteful, and fairly worth
      the moderate price set on them. At Miss Cleveland's counter, there was much noisy
      laughter—many jocular cheats—tricks for gaining money, and refusals to give change; and it
      seemed to be very popular with the Stoneborough people, and to carry on a brisk trade. The
      only languor was in Lady Leonora's quarter—the articles were too costly, and hung on hand; nor
      were the ladies sufficiently well known, nor active enough, to gain custom, excepting Meta,
      who drove a gay traffic at her end of the stall, which somewhat redeemed the general
      languor.</p>
     <p>Her eyes were, all the time, watching for her father, and, suddenly perceiving him, she left
      her trade in charge of the delighted and important Mary, and hastened to walk round with him,
      and shew him the humours of the fair.</p>
     <pb n="358"/>
     <p>Mary, in her absence, had the supreme happiness of obtaining Norman as a customer. He wanted
      a picture for his rooms at Oxford, and water-coloured drawings were, as Tom had observed,
      suitable staple commodities for Miss Rivers. Mary tried to make him choose a brightly-coloured
      pheasant, with a pencil back-ground; and, then, a fine foaming sea-piece, by some unknown Lady
      Adelaide, that much dazzled her imagination; but nothing would serve him but a sketch of an
      old cedar tree, with Stoneborough Minster in the distance, and the Welsh hills beyond, which
      Mary thought a remarkable piece of bad taste, since—could he not see all that any day of his
      life? and was it worth while to give fourteen shillings and sixpence for it? But he said it
      was all for the good of Cocksmoor, and Mary was only too glad to add to her hoard of coin; so
      she only marvelled at his extravagance, and offered to take care of it for him; but, to this,
      he would not consent. He made her pack it up for him, and had just put the whitey-brown parcel
      under his arm, when Mr. Rivers and his daughter came up, before he was aware. Mary proudly
      advertised Meta that she had sold something for her.</p>
     <p>'Indeed! What was it?'</p>
     <p>'Your great picture of Stoneborough!' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Is that gone? I am sorry you have parted with that, my dear; it was one of your best,' said
      Mr. Rivers, in his soft, sleepy, gentle tone.</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa, I can do another. But, I wonder! I put that extortionate price on it, thinking no
      one would give it, and so that I should keep it for you. Who has it, Mary?'</p>
     <p>'Norman, there. He would have it, though I told him it was very dear.'</p>
     <p>Norman, pressed near them by the crowd, had been unable to escape, and stood blushing,
      hesitating, and doubting whether he ought to restore the prize, which he had watched so long,
      and obtained so eagerly.</p>
     <p>'Oh! it is you?' said Mr. Rivers, politely. 'O, no, do not think of exchanging it. I am
      rejoiced that one should have it who can appreciate it. It was its falling into the hands of a
      stranger that I disliked. You think with me, that it is one of her best drawings.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I do,' said Norman, still rather hesitating.</p>
     <p>'She did that with C—, when he was here last year. He taught her very well. Have you that
      other here, that you took with him, my dear? The view from the gate, I mean.'</p>
     <p>'No, dear papa. You told me not to sell that.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! I remember; that is right. But there are some very pretty copies from Prout here.'</p>
     <pb n="359"/>
     <p>While he was seeking them, Meta contrived to whisper—'If you could persuade him to go in
      doors—this confusion of people is so bad for him, and I must not come away. I was in hopes of
      Dr. May, but he is with the little ones.'</p>
     <p>Norman signed comprehension, and Meta said, 'Those copies are not worth seeing, but, you
      know, papa, you have the originals in the library.'</p>
     <p>Mr. Rivers looked pleased, but was certain that Norman could not prefer the sketches to this
      gay scene. However, it took very little persuasion to induce him to do what he wished, and he
      took Norman's arm, crossed the lawn, and arrived in his own study, where it was a great treat
      to him to catch anyone who would admire his accumulation of prints, drawings, coins, etc.;
      and his young friend was both very well amused, and pleased to be setting Miss Rivers's mind
      at ease on her father's account. It was not till half-past four that Dr. May knocked at the
      door, and stood surprised at finding his son there. Mr. Rivers spoke warmly of the young
      Oxonian's kindness in leaving the fair for an old man, and praised Norman's taste in art.
      Norman rose to take leave, but still thought it incumbent on him to offer to give up the
      picture, if Mr. Rivers set an especial value on it. But Mr. Rivers went to the length of being
      very glad that it was in his possession, and added to it a very pretty drawing of the same
      size, by a noted master, which had been in the water-colour exhibition, and, while Norman
      walked away, well pleased, Mr. Rivers began to extol him to his father, as a very superior and
      sensible young man, of great promise, and began to wish George had the same turn.</p>
     <p>Norman, on returning to the Fancy Fair, found the world in all the ardour of raffles. Lady
      Leonora's contributions were the chief prizes, which attracted everyone, and, of course, the
      result was delightfully incongruous. Poor Ethel, who had been persuaded to venture a shilling
      to please Blanche, who had spent all her own, obtained the two jars in potichomanie, and was
      regarding them with a face worth painting. Harvey Anderson had a doll, George Rivers a wooden
      monkey, that jumped over a stick; and, if Hector Ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a
      beautiful mother-of-pearl inlaid workbox, which he had vainly wished to buy for Margaret,
      Flora only gained a match-box of her own, well known always to miss fire, but which had been
      decided to be good enough for the bazaar.</p>
     <p>By fair means or foul, the commodities were cleared off, and, while the sun-beams faded from
      the trodden grass, the crowds disappeared, and the vague compliment—"a very good bazaar," was
      exchanged between the lingering sellers and their friends.</p>
     <p>Flora was again to sleep at the Grange, and return the next day,
      <pb n="360"/> for a committee to be held over the gains, which were not yet fully ascertained.
      So Dr. May gathered his flock together, and packed them, boys and all, into the two
      conveyances, and Ethel bade Meta good night, almost wondering to hear her merry voice say, 'It
      has been a delightful day, has it not? It was so kind of your brother to take care of
      papa.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! it was delightful,' echoed Mary,'and I took one pound fifteen and sixpence!'</p>
     <p>'I hope it will do great good to Cocksmoor,' added Meta, 'but, if you want real help, you
      know, you must come to us.'</p>
     <p>Ethel smiled, but hurried her departure, for she saw Blanche again tormented by Mr. George
      Rivers, to know what had become of the guard, telling her that, if she would not say, he
      should be furiously jealous.</p>
     <p>Blanche hid her face on Ethel's arm, when they were in the carriage, and almost cried with
      indignant "shamefastness." That long-desired day had not bee one of unmixed happiness to her,
      poor child, and Ethel doubted whether it had been so to anyone, except, indeed, to Mary, whose
      desires never soared so high but that they were easily fulfilled, and whose placid content was
      not easily wounded. All she was wishing now was, that Harry were at home, to receive his
      paper-case.</p>
     <p>The return to Margaret was real pleasure. The narration of all that had passed was an event
      to her. She was so charmed with her presents, of every degree; things, unpleasant at the time,
      could, by drollery in the relating, be made mirthful fun, ever after; Dr. May and the boys
      were so comical in their observations—Mary's wonder and simplicity came in so amazingly—and
      there was such merriment at Ethel's two precious jars, that she could hardly wish they had not
      come to her. On one head, they were all agreed, in dislike of George Rivers, whom Mary
      pronounced to be a detestable man, and, when gently called to order by Margaret, defended it,
      by saying that Miss Bracy said it was better to detest than to hate, while Blanche coloured up
      to the ears, and hid herself behind the arm-chair; and Dr. May qualified the censure by
      saying, he believed there was no great harm in the youth, but that he was shallow-brained, and
      extravagant, and, having been born in the days when Mr. Rivers had been working himself up in
      the world, had not had so good an education as his little half-sister.</p>
     <p>'Well, what are you thinking of?' said her father, laying his hand on Ethel's arm, as she
      was wearily and pensively putting together the scattered purchases, before going up to
      bed.</p>
     <p>'I was thinking, papa, that there is a great deal of trouble taken, in this world, for a
      very little pleasure.'</p>
     <pb n="361"/>
     <p>'The trouble is the pleasure, in most cases, most misanthropical Miss!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, that is true; but, if so, why cannot it be taken for some good?'</p>
     <p>'They meant it to be good,' said Dr. May. 'Come, I cannot have you severe and
      ungrateful.'</p>
     <p>'So I have been telling myself, papa, all along; but, now that the day has come, and I have
      seen what jealousies, and competitions, and vanities, and disappointments it has produced—not
      even poor little Blanche allowed any comfort—I am almost sick at heart, with thinking
      Cocksmoor was the excuse!'</p>
     <p>'Spectators are more philosophical than actors, Ethel. Others have not been tying parcels
      all day.'</p>
     <p>'I had rather do that than—but that is the "Fox and the Grapes," ' said Ethel, smiling.
      'What I mean is, that the real gladness of life is not in these great occasions of pleasure,
      but in the little side delights, that come in the midst of one's work, don't they, papa? Why
      is it worth while to go and search for a day's pleasuring?'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, my child! I don't like to hear you talk so,' said Dr. May, looking anxiously at her.
      'It may be too true, but it is not youthful, nor hopeful. It is not as your mother or I felt
      in our young days, when a treat was a treat to us, and gladdened our hearts long before and
      after. I am afraid you have been too much saddened with loss and care—'</p>
     <p>'Oh! no, papa!' said Ethel, rousing herself, though speaking huskily. 'You know I am your
      merry Ethel. You know I can be happy enough—only at home—'</p>
     <p>And Ethel, though she had tried to be cheerful, leant against his arm, and shed a few
      tears.</p>
     <p>'The fact is, she is tired out,' said Dr. May, soothingly, yet half laughing. 'She is not a
      beauty or a grace, and she is thoughtful and quiet, and so she moralizes, instead of enjoying,
      as the world goes by. I dare say a night's rest will make all the difference in the
      world.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! but there is more to come. That Ladies' Committee at Cocksmoor!'</p>
     <p>'They are not there yet, Ethel. Good night, you tired little cynic.'</p>

     <p>The next day, Ethel had hoped for a return to reason, but behold, the world was
      cross! The reaction of the long excitement was felt, Gertude fretted, and was unwell; Aubrey
      was pettish at his lessons; and Mary and Blanche were weary, yawning and inattentive, every
      straw was a burthen, and Miss Bracy had feelings.</p>
     <p>Ethel had been holding an interminable conversation with her in the school-room, interrupted
      at last by a summons to speak to a Cocksmoor woman at the back-door, and she was returning
      from the kitchen, when the Doctor called her into his study.</p>
     <p>'Ethel! what is all this? Mary has found Miss Bracy in floods of tears in the school-room,
      because she says you told her she was ill-tempered.'</p>
     <p>'I am sure you will be quite as much surprised,' said Ethel, somewhat exasperated, 'when you
      hear that you lacerated her feelings yesterday.'</p>
     <p>'I? Why what did I do?' exclaimed Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'You shewed your evident want of confidence in her.'</p>
     <p>'I? What can I have done?'</p>
     <p>'You met Aubrey and Gertrude in her charge, and you took them away at once to walk with
      you.'</p>
     <p>'Well?'</p>
     <p>'Well, that was it. She saw you had no confidence in her.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, what on earth can you mean? I saw the two children dragging on her, and I thought
      she would see nothing that was going on, and would be glad to be released; and I wanted them
      to go with me, and see Meta's gold pheasants.'</p>
     <p>'That was the offence. She has been breaking her heart all this time, because she was sure,
      from your manner, that you were displeased to see them alone with her—eating <hi>bon-bons</hi>
      , I believe, and therefore took them away.'</p>
     <p>'Daisy is the worse for her <hi>bon-bons</hi> , I believe, but the over-dose of them rests
      on my shoulders. I do not know how to believe you, Ethel. Of course you told her, nothing of
      the kind crossed my mind, poor thing.'</p>
     <pb n="363"/>
     <p>'I told her so, over and over again, as I have done forty times before, but her feelings are
      always being hurt!'</p>
     <p>'Poor thing, poor thing! no doubt it is a trying situation, and she is sensitive. Surely you
      are all forbearing with her?'</p>
     <p>'I hope we are,' said Ethel; 'but how can we tell what vexes her?'</p>
     <p>'And what is this, of your telling her she was ill-tempered?' asked Dr. May,
      incredulously.</p>
     <p>'Well, papa,' said Ethel, softened, yet wounded by his thinking it so impossible. 'I had
      often thought I ought to tell her that these sensitive feelings of hers were nothing but
      temper; and perhaps— indeed I know I do—I partake of the general fractiousness of the house
      to-day, and I did not bear it so patiently as usual. I did say that I thought it wrong to
      foster her fancies; for if she looked at them coolly, she would find they were only a form of
      pride and temper.'</p>
     <p>'It did not come well from you, Ethel,' said the Doctor, looking vexed.</p>
     <p>'No, I know it did not,' said Ethel, meekly; 'but oh! to have these janglings once a week,
      and to see no end to them!'</p>
     <p>'Once a week?'</p>
     <p>'It is really as often, or more often!' said Ethel. If any of us criticize anything the
      girls have done, if there is a change in any arrangement, if she thinks herself neglected—I
      can't tell you what little matters suffice; she will catch me, and argue with me, till-oh!
      till we are both half-dead, and yet cannot stop ourselves.'</p>
     <p>'Why do you argue?'</p>
     <p>'If I could only help it!'</p>
     <p>'Bad management,' said the Doctor, in a low musing tone. 'You want a head!'—and he
      sighed.</p>
     <p>'Oh! papa, I did not mean to distress you. I would not have told you, if I had remebered—but
      I am worried to-day, and off my guard—'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, I thought you were the one on whom I could depend for hearing everything.'</p>
     <p>'These were such nonsense!'</p>
     <p>'What may seem nonsense to you, is not the same to her. You must be forbearing, Ethel.
      Remember that dependance is prone to morbid sensitiveness, especially in those who have a
      humble estimate of themselves.'</p>
     <p>'It seems to me that touchiness is more pride than humility,' said Ethel, whose temper,
      already not in the smoothest state, found it hard that, after having long borne patiently with
      these constant arguments, she should find Miss Bracy made the chief object of compassion.</p>
     <p>Dr. May's chivalrous feeling caused him to take the part.
      <pb n="364"/> of the weak, and he answered, 'You know nothing about it. Among our own kin, we
      can afford to pass over slights, because we are sure the heart is right—we do not know what it
      is to be among strangers, uncertain of any claim to their esteem or kindness. Sad! sad!' he
      continued, as the picture wrought on him. 'Each trifle seems a token one way or the other! I
      am very sorry I grieved the poor thing yesterday. I must go and tell her so at once.'</p>
     <p>He put Ethel aside, and knocked at the school-room door, while Ethel stood, mortified. 'He
      thinks I have been neglecting, or speaking harshly to her! For fifty times that I have borne
      with her maundering, I have, at last, once told her the truth; and for that I am accused of
      want of forbearance! Now he will go and make much of her, and pity her, till she will think
      herself an injured heroine, and be worse than ever; and he will do away with all the good of
      my advice, and want me to ask her pardon for it—but that I never will. It was only the truth,
      and I will stick to it.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel!' cried Mary, running up to her, then slackening her pace, and whispering; 'You did
      not tell Miss Bracy she was ill-tempered.'</p>
     <p>'No—not exactly. How could you tell papa I did?'</p>
     <p>'She said so. She was crying, and I asked what was the matter, and she said, my sister Ethel
      said, she was ill-tempered.'</p>
     <p>'She made a great exaggeration then,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I am sure she was very cross all day!' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Well, that is no business of yours,' said Ethel, pettishly. 'What now? Mary! don't look out
      at the street window.'</p>
     <p>'It is Flora—the Grange carriage—' whispered Mary, as the two sisters made a precipitate
      retreat into the drawing-room.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, Dr. May had been in the school-room. Miss Bracy had ceased her tears before he
      came—they had been her retort on Ethel, and she had not intended the world to know of them.
      Half-disconcerted, half-angry, she heard the Doctor approach. She was a gentle, tearful woman,
      one of those who are often called meek, under an erroneous idea, that meekness consists in
      making herself exceedingly miserable under every kind of grievance; and she now had a sort of
      melancholy satisfaction in believing that the young ladies had fabricated an exaggerated
      complaint of her temper, and that she was going to become injured innocence. To think herself
      accused of a great wrong, excused her from perceiving herself guilty of a lesser one.</p>
     <p>'Miss Bracy,' said Dr. May, entering with his frank, sweet look; 'I am concerned that I
      vexed you by taking the children to walk with me yesterday. I thought such little brats would
      be troublesome
      <pb n="365"/> to any but their spoiling papa, but they would have been in safer hands with
      you. You would not have been as weak as I was, in regard to sugar-plums.'</p>
     <p>Such amends as these confused Miss Bracy, who found it pleasanter to be lamentable with
      Ethel, than to receive a full apology, for her imagined offence, from the master of the house.
      Feeling both small and absurd, she murmured something of "oh no;" and "being sure," and hoped
      he was going, so that she might sit down to pity herself, for those girls having made her
      appear so ridiculous.</p>
     <p>No such thing! Dr. May put a chair for her, and sat down himself, saying, with a smile, 'You
      see, you must trust us sometimes, and overlook it, if we are less considerate than we might
      be. We have rough, careless habits with each other, and forget that all are not used to
      them.'</p>
     <p>Miss Bracy exclaimed, 'Oh! no, never, they were most kind.'</p>
     <p>'We wish to be,' said Dr. May, 'but there are little neglects—or you think there are. I will
      not say there are none, for that would be answering too much for human nature, or that they
      are fanciful —for that would be as little comfort as to tell a patient that the pain is only
      nervous—'</p>
     <p>Miss Bracy smiled, for she could remember instances when, after suffering much at the time,
      she had found the affront imaginary.</p>
     <p>He was glad of that smile, and proceeded. 'You will let me speak to you, as to one of my own
      girls? To them, I should say, use the only true cure. Don't brood over vexations, small or
      great, but think of them as trials that, borne bravely, become blessings.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! but Dr. May!' she exclaimed, shocked; 'nothing in your house could call for such
      feelings.'</p>
     <p>'I hope we are not <hi>very</hi> savage,' he said, smiling; 'but, indeed, I still say it is
      the safest rule. It would be the only one if you were really among unkind people; and, if you
      take so much to heart an unlucky neglect of mine, what would you do if the slight were a true
      one?'</p>
     <p>'You are right; but my feelings were always over sensitive;' and this she said with a sort
      of complacency.</p>
     <p>'Well, we must try to brace them,' said Dr. May, much as if prescribing for her. 'Will not
      you believe in our confidence and esteem, and harden yourself against any outward
      unintentional piece of incivility?'</p>
     <p>She felt as if she could at that moment.</p>
     <p>'Or at least, try to forgive and forget them. Talking them over only deepens the sense of
      them, and discussions do not good to
      <pb n="366"/> anyone. My daughters are anxious to be your best friends, as I hope you
      know.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! they are most kind—'</p>
     <p>'But, you see, I must say this—' added Dr. May, somewhat hesitating—'as they have no mother
      to—to spare all this—' and, then, growing clearer, he proceeded, 'I must beg you to be
      forbearing with them, and not perplex yourself and them with arguing on what cannot be helped.
      They have not the experience that could enable them to finish such a discussion without
      unkindness; and it can only waste the spirits, and raise fresh subjects of regret. I must
      leave you—I hear myself called.'</p>
     <p>Miss Bracy began to be sensible that she had somewhat abused Ethel's patience; and the
      unfortunate speech about the source of her sensitiveness, did not appear to her so direfully
      cruel as at first. She hoped everyone would forget all about it, and resolved not to take
      umbrage so easily another time, or else be silent about it, but she was not a person of much
      resolution.</p>
     <p>The Doctor found that Meta Rivers and her brother had brought Flora home, and were in the
      drawing-room, where Margaret was hearing another edition of the history of the fair, and a
      bye-play was going on, of teasing Blanche about the chain.</p>
     <p>George Rivers was trying to persuade her to make one for him; and her refusal came out at
      last, in an almost passionate key, in the midst of the other conversation—'No! I say—no!'</p>
     <p>'Another no, and that will be yes.'</p>
     <p>'No! I won't! I don't like you well enough!'</p>
     <p>Margaret gravely sent Blanche and the other children away, to take their walk, and the
      brother and sister, soon after, took leave, when Flora called Ethel to hasten to the Ladies'
      Committee, that they might arrange the disposal of the one hundred and fifty pounds, the
      amount of their gains.</p>
     <p>'To see the fate of Cocksmoor,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Do you think I cannot manage the Stoneborough folk?' said Flora, looking radiant with good
      humour, and conscious of power. 'Poor Ethel! I am doing you good against your will! Never
      mind, here is wherewith to build the school, and the management will be too happy to fall into
      our hands. Do you think everyone is as ready as you are, to walk three miles, and back,
      continually?'</p>
     <p>There was sense in this; there always was sense in what Flora said, but it jarred on Ethel;
      and it seemed almost unsympathizing in her to be so gay, when the rest were wearied or
      perturbed. Ethel would have been very glad of a short space to recollect herself, and recover
      her good temper; but it was late, and Flora hurried her to
      <pb n="367"/> put on her bonnet, and come to the Committee. 'I'll take care of your
      interests,' she said, as they set out. 'You look as doleful as if you thought you should be
      robbed of Cocksmoor, but that is the last thing that will happen, you will see.'</p>
     <p>'It would not be acting fairly to let them build for us, and then for us to put them out of
      the management,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'My dear, they want importance, not action. They will leave the real power to us of
      themselves.'</p>
     <p>'You like to build Cocksmoor with such instruments,' said Ethel, whose ruffled condition
      made her forget her resolution not to argue with Flora.'</p>
     <p>'Bricks are made of clay!' said Flora. 'There, that was said like Norman himself! On your
      plan, we might have gone on for forty years, saving seven shillings a year, and spending six,
      whenever there was an illness in the place.'</p>
     <p>'You, who used to dislike these people more than even I did!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'That was when I was an infant, my dear, and did not know how to deal with them. I will take
      care—I will even save Cherry Elwood for you, if I can. Alan Ernescliffe's ten pounds is a
      noble weapon.'</p>
     <p>'You always mean to manage everything, and then you have no time!' said Ethel, sensible all
      the time of her own ill-humour, and of her sister's patience and amiability, yet propelled to
      speak the unpleasant truths that in her better moods were held back.</p>
     <p>Still Flora was good tempered, though Ethel would almost have preferred her being provoked;
      'I know,' she said,'I have been using you ill, and leaving the world on your shoulders, but it
      was all in your service and Cocksmoor's; and now we shall begin to be reasonable and useful
      again.'</p>
     <p>'I hope so,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Really, Ethel, to comfort you, I think I shall send you with Norman to dine at Abbotstoke
      Grange on Wednesday. Mr. Rivers begged us to come; he is so anxious to make it lively for his
      son.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, I do not think Mr. George Rivers and I should be likely to get on together. What
      a bad style of wit! You heard what Mary said about him?' and Ethel repeated the doubt between
      hating and detesting.</p>
     <p>'Young men never know how to talk to little girls,' was Flora's reply.</p>
     <p>At this moment they came up with one of the Miss Andersons, and Flora began to exchange
      civilities, and talk over yesterday's events with great animation. Her notice always gave
      pleasure, brightened as it was by the peculiarly engaging address which she had inherited from
      her father, and which, therefore, was perfectly
      <pb n="368"/> easy and natural. Fanny Anderson was flattered and gratified, rather by the
      manner than the words, and, on excellent terms, they entered the Committee-room, namely, the
      school-mistress's parlour.</p>
     <p>There were nine ladies on the Committee—nine muses, as the Doctor called them,
       <hi>because</hi> they produced anything but harmony. Mrs. Ledwich was in the chair; Miss Rich
      was secretary, and had her pen and ink, and account-book ready. Flora came in, smiling and
      greeting; Ethel, grave, earnest, and annoyed, behind her, trying to be perfectly civil, but
      not at all enjoying the congratulation on the successful bazaar. The ladies all talked and
      discussed their yesterday's adventures, gathering in little knots, as they traced the fate of
      favourite achievements of their skill, while Ethel, lugubrious and impatient, beside Flora,
      the only one not engaged, and, therefore, conscious of the hubbub of clacking tongues.</p>
     <p>At last, Mrs. Ledwich glanced at the mistress's watch, in its paste-board tower, in Gothic
      architecture, and insisted on proceeding to business. So they all sat down round a circular
      table, with a very fine red, blue, and black oil-cloth, whose pattern was inseparably
      connected, in Ethel's mind, with absurdity, tedium, and annoyance.</p>
     <p>The business was opened by the announcement of what they all knew before, that the proceeds
      of the Fancy Fair amounted to one hundred and forty-nine pounds, fifteen shillings and
      tenpence.</p>
     <p>Then came a pause, and Mrs. Ledwich said that next they had to consider what was the best
      means of disposing of the sum gained in this most gratifying manner. Everyone except Flora,
      Ethel, and quiet Mrs. Ward, began to talk at once. There was a great deal about Elizabethan
      architecture, crossed by much more, in which normal, industrial, and common things, most often
      met Ethel's ear, with some stories, second-hand, from Harvey Anderson, of marvellous mistakes;
      and, on the opposite side of the table, there was Mrs. Ledwich, impressively saying something
      to the silent Mrs. Ward, marking her periods with emphatic beats with her pencil, and each
      seemed to close with "Mrs. Perkinson's niece," whom Ethel knew to be Cherry's intended
      supplanter. She looked piteously at Flora, who only smiled and made a sign with her hand to
      her to be patient. Ethel fretted inwardly at that serene sense of power; but she could not but
      admire how well Flora knew how to bide her time, when, having waited till Mrs. Ledwich had
      nearly wound up her discourse on Mrs. Elwood's impudence, and Mrs. Perkinson's niece, she
      leant towards Miss Boulder, who sat between, and whispered to her: 'Ask Mrs. Ledwich if we
      should not begin with some steps for getting the land.'</p>
     <p>Miss Boulder, having acted as conductor, the president exclaimed,
      <pb n="369"/> 'Just so, the land is the first consideration. We must at once take steps for
      obtaining it.' Thereupon Mrs. Ledwich, who "always did things methodically," moved, and Miss
      Anderson seconded, that the land requisite for the school must be obtained, and the nine
      ladies held up their hands, and resolved it.</p>
     <p>Miss Rich duly recorded the great resolution, and Miss Boulder suggested that, perhaps, they
      might write to the National Society, or Government, or something; whereat Miss Rich began to
      flourish one of the very long goose quills which stood in the inkstand before her, chiefly as
      insignia of office, for she always wrote with a small, stiff metal pen.</p>
     <p>Flora here threw in a query, whether the National Society, or Government, or something,
      would give them a grant, unless they had the land to build upon?</p>
     <p>The ladies all started off hereupon, and all sorts of instances of hardness of heart were
      mentioned; the most relevant of which was, that the Church Building Society would not give a
      grant to Mr. Holloway's proprietary Chapel at Whitford, when Mrs. Ledwich was suddenly struck
      with the notion that dear Mr. Holloway might be prevailed on to come to Stoneborough, to
      preach a sermon in the Minster, for the benefit of Cocksmoor, when they would all hold plates
      at the door. Flora gave Ethel a tranquillizing pat, and, as Mrs. Ledwich turned to her, asking
      whether she thought Dr. May, or Dr. Hoxton, would prevail on him to come, she said, with her
      winning look, 'I think that consideration had better wait till we have some more definite
      view. Had we not better turn to this land question?'</p>
     <p>'Quite true!' they all agreed, but to whom did the land belong? —and what a chorus arose!
      Miss Anderson thought it belonged to Mr. Nicolson, because the wagons of slate had James
      Nicolson on them, and, if so, they had no chance, for he was an old miser—and six stories
      illustrative thereof ensued. Miss Rich was quite sure some Body held it, and Bodies were slow
      of movement. Mrs. Ledwich remembered some question of enclosing, and thought all waste lands
      were under the Crown; she knew that the Stoneborough people once had a right to pasture their
      cattle, because Mr. Southron's cow had tumbled down a loam-pit, when her mother was a girl.
      No, that was on Far-view down, out the other way! Miss Harrison was positive that Sir Henry
      Walkinghame had some right there, and would not Dr. May apply to him? Mrs. Grey thought it
      ought to be part of the Drydale estate, and Miss Boulder was certain that Mr. Bramshaw knew
      all about it.</p>
     <p>Flora's gentle voice carried conviction that she knew what she was saying, when, at last,
      they left a moment for her to speak—
      <pb n="370"/> (Ethel would have done so long ago.) 'If I am not mistaken, the land is a
      copyhold of Sir Henry Walkinghame, held under the manor of Drydale, which belongs to M—
      College, and is underlet to Mr. Nicolson.'</p>
     <p>Everybody, being partially right, was delighted, and had known it all before; Miss Boulder
      agreed with Miss Anderson, that Miss May had stated it as lucidly as Mr. Bramshaw could. The
      next question was, to whom to apply? and, after as much as was expedient had been said in
      favour of each, it was decided that, as Sir Henry Walkinghame was abroad, no one knew exactly
      where, it would be best to go to the fountain-head, and write at once to the Principal of the
      College. But who was to write? Flora proposed Mr. Ramsden as the fittest person, but this was
      negatived. Everyone declared that he would never take the trouble, and Miss Rich began to
      agitate her pens. By this time, however, Mrs. Ward, who was opposite to the Gothic
      clock-tower, began to look uneasy, and suggested, in a nervous manner, that it was half-past
      five, and she was afraid Mr. Ward would be kept waiting for his dinner. Mrs. Grey began to
      have like fears, that Mr. Grey would be come in from his ride, after banking hours. The other
      ladies began to think of tea, and the meeting decided on adjourning till that day next week,
      when the Committee would sit upon Miss Rich's letter.</p>
     <p>'My dear Miss Flora!' began Miss Rich, adhering to her as they parted with the rest at the
      end of the street, 'How am I to write to a Principal? Am I to begin Reverend Sir, or my Lord,
      or is he Venerable, like an Archdeacon? What is his name, and what am I to say?'</p>
     <p>'Why; it is not a correspondence much in my line,' said Flora, laughing.</p>
     <p>'Ah! but you are so intimate with Dr. Hoxton, and your brothers at Oxford! You must
      know—'</p>
     <p>'I'll take advice,' said Flora, good-naturedly. 'Shall I come, and call before Friday, and
      tell you the result.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! pray! It will be a real favour! Good morning—'</p>
     <p>'There,' said Flora, as the sisters turned homewards; 'Cherry is not going to be turned out
      just yet!'</p>
     <p>'How could you, Flora? Now they will have that man from Whitford, and you said not a word
      against it!'</p>
     <p>'What was the use of adding to the hubbub? A little opposition would make them determined on
      having him. You will see, Ethel, we shall get the ground on our own terms, and then it will be
      time to settle about the mistress. If the harvest holidays were not over, we would try to send
      Cherry to a training-school, so as to leave them no excuse.'</p>
     <pb n="371"/>
     <p>'I hate all this management and contrivance. It would be more honest to speak our minds, and
      not pretend to agree with them.'</p>
     <p>'My dear Ethel! have I spoken a word contrary to my opinion? It is not fit for me, a girl of
      twenty, to go disputing and dragooning as you would have me; but a little <hi>scavoir
       faire</hi> , a grain of common sense, thrown in among the babble, always works. Don't you
      remember how Mrs. Ward's sister told us that a whole crowd of tottering Chinese ladies would
      lean on her, because they felt her firm support, though it was out of sight?'</p>
     <p>Ethel did not answer; she had self-control enough left, not to retort upon Flora's estimate
      of herself, but the irritation was strong; she felt as if her cherished views of Cocksmoor
      were insulted, as well as set aside, by the place being made the occasion of so much folly and
      vain prattle, the sanctity of her vision of self-devotion destroyed by such interference, and
      Flora's promises did not reassure her. She doubted Flora's power, and had still more
      repugnance to the means by which her sister tried to govern; they did not seem to her
      straightforward, and she could not endure Flora's complacency in their success. Had it not
      been for her real love for the place, and people, as well as the principle which prompted that
      love, she could have found it in her heart to throw up all concern with it, rather than become
      a fellow-worker with such a conclave.</p>
     <p>Such were Ethel's feelings as the pair walked down the street; the one sister bright and
      smiling with the good humour that had endured many shocks all that day, all good-nature and
      triumph, looking forward to success, great benefit to Cocksmoor, and plenty of management,
      with credit and praise to herself; the other, downcast and irritable, with annoyance at the
      interference with her schemes, at the prospects of her school, and at herself for being out of
      temper, prone to murmur or to reply tartly, and not able to recover from her mood, but only,
      as she neared the house, lapsing into her other trouble, and preparing to resist any
      misjudged, though kind attempt of her father, to make her unsay her rebuke to Miss Bracy.
      Pride and temper! Ah! Etheldred! where were they now?</p>
     <p>Dr. May was at his study door, as his daughters entered the hall, and Ethel expected the
      order which she meant to question; but, instead of this, after a brief inquiry after the
      doings of the nine muses, which Flora answered, so as to make him laugh, he stopped Ethel, as
      she was going up-stairs, by saying, 'I do not know whether this letter is intended for
      Richard, or for me. At any rate, it concerns you most.'</p>
     <p>The envelope was addressed to the Reverend Richard May, D.D., Market Stoneborough, and the
      letter began, 'Reverend Sir.' So far Ethel saw, and exclaimed, with amusement, then, with a
      long-drawn
      <pb n="372"/> "Ah!" and an interjection, "My poor dear Una!" she became absorbed, the large
      tears—yes, Ethel's reluctant tears gathering slowly and dropping.</p>
     <p>The letter was from a Clergyman far away in the north of England, who said he could not,
      though a stranger, resist the desire to send to Dr. May, an account of a poor girl, who seemed
      to have received great benefits from him, or from some of his family, especially as she had
      shown great eagerness on his proposing to write.</p>
     <p>He said it was nearly a year since there had come into his parish a troop of railway men and
      their families. For the most part, they were completely wild and rude, unused to any pastoral
      care; but, even on the first Sunday, he had noticed a keen-looking, freckled, ragged,
      unmistakably Irish girl, creeping into Church, with a Prayer-book in her hand, and had
      afterwards found her hanging about the door of the school. "I never saw a more engaging,
      though droll, wild expression, than that with which she looked up to me—" (Ethel's cry of
      delight was, at that sentence—she knew that look so well, and had yearned after it so often!)
      "I found her far better instructed than her appearance had led me to expect, and more truly
      impressed with the spirit of what she had learnt, than it has often been my lot to find
      children. She was perfect in the New Testament history—" ('Ah! that she was not, when she went
      away!') "and was in the habit of constantly attending Church, and using morning and evening
      prayers—" ('Oh! how I longed, when she went away, to beg her to keep them up! Dear Una.') "On
      my questions, as to how she had been taught, she always replied, 'Mr. Richard May,' or 'Miss
      Athel.' You must excuse me, if I have not correctly caught the name, from her Irish
      pronunciation—" ('I am afraid he thinks my name is Athaliah! But, oh! this dear girl! How I
      have wished to hear of her.') "Everything was answered with 'Mr. Richard,' or 'Miss Athel;'
      and, if I enquired further, her face would light up with a beam of gratitude, and she would
      run on as long as I could listen, with instances of their kindness. It was the same with her
      mother, a wild, rude specimen of an Irishwoman, whom I never could bring to Church herself,
      but who ran on loudly with their praises, usually ending with, 'Heavens be their bed,' and
      saying that Una had been quite a different girl since the young ladies and gentleman found her
      out, and put them parables in her head."</p>
     <p>"For my own part, I can testify that, in the seven months that she attended my school, I
      never had a serious fault to find with her but far more often to admire the earnestness and
      devout spirit, as well as the kindness and generosity apparent in all her conduct. Bad living,
      and an unwholesome locality, have occasioned a typhus
      <pb n="373"/> fever among the poor strangers in this place, and Una was one of the first
      victims. Her mother, almost from the first, gave her up, saying, she knew she was one marked
      for glory; and Una has been lying, day after day, in a sort of half-delirious state,
      constantly repeating hymns and psalms, and generally, apparently very happy, except when one
      distress occurred again and again, whether delirious or sensible, namely, that she had never
      gone to wish Miss May good-bye, and thank her; and, that may be, she and Mr. Richard thought
      her ungrateful; and, she would sometimes beg, in her phraseology, to go on her bare knees to
      Stoneborough, only to see Miss Athel again.</p>
     <p>"Her mother, I should say, told me the girl had been half-mad, at not being allowed to go
      and take leave of Miss May; and she had been sorry herself, but her husband had come home
      suddenly from the search for work, and, having made his arrangements, removed them at once,
      early the next morning—too early to go to the young lady—though, she said, Una did—as they
      passed through Stoneborough —run down the street before she was aware, and she found her
      sobbing, fit to break her heart, before the house—" ('Oh! why, why was I not up, and at the
      window! Oh, my Una! to think of that!') "When I spoke of writing to let Miss May hear how it
      was, the poor girl caught at the idea with the utmost delight. Her weakness was too great to
      allow her to utter many words distinctly, when I asked her what she would have me say, but
      these were as well as I could understand:—'The blessing of one, that they have brought peace
      unto. Tell them I pray, and will pray, that they may walk in the robe of glory—and tell Mr.
      Richard that I mind what he said to me, of taking hold on the sure hope. God crown all their
      crosses unto them, and fulfil all their desires unto everlasting life.' "I feel that I am not
      rendering her words with all their fervour and beauty of Irish expression, but I would that I
      could fully retain and transmit them, for, those who have so led her, must, indeed, be able to
      feel them precious. I never saw a more peaceful frame of penitence and joy. She died last
      night, sleeping herself away, without more apparent suffering, and will be committed to the
      earth on Sunday next, all her fellow-scholars attending; and, I hope, profiting by the example
      she has left."</p>
     <p>"I have only to add my most earnest congratulations to those, whose labour of love has borne
      such blessed fruit; and, hoping you will pardon the liberty, etc."</p>
     <p>Etheldred finished the letter through blinding tears, while rising sobs almost choked her.
      She ran away to her own room, bolted the door, and threw herself on her knees, beside her
      bed—now confusedly giving thanks for such results—now weeping bitterly over
      <pb n="374"/> her own unworthiness. Oh! what was she in the sight of Heaven, compared with
      what this poor girl had deemed her—with what this Clergyman thought her? She, the teacher,
      taught, trained, and guarded, from her infancy, by her wise mother, and by such a father! She,
      to have given way, all day, to pride, jealousy, anger, selfish love of her own will; when this
      poor girl had embraced, and held fast, the blessed hope, from the very crumbs they had brought
      her! Nothing could have so humbled the distrustful spirit that had been working in Ethel,
      which had been scotched into silence—not killed—when she endured the bazaar, and now had been
      indemnifying itself by repining at every stumbling-block. Her own scholar's blessing was the
      rebuke that went most home to her heart, for having doubted whether good could be worked in
      any way, save her own.</p>
     <p>She was interrupted by Mary, trying to open the door, and, admitting her, heard her wonder
      at the traces of her tears, and ask what there was about Una? Ethel gave her the letter, and
      Mary's tears showered very fast—they always came readily. 'Oh! Ethel! how glad Richard will
      be!'</p>
     <p>'Yes; it is all Richard's doing. So much more good, and wise, and humble, as he is. No
      wonder his teaching—' and Ethel sat down and cried again.</p>
     <p>Mary pondered. 'It makes me very glad,' she said; 'and yet I don't know why one cries.
      Ethel, do you think'—she came near, and whispered—'that Una has met dear mamma there?'</p>
     <p>Ethel kissed her. It was almost the first time Mary had spoken of her mother; and she
      answered,'Dear Mary, we cannot tell—we may think. It is all one Communion, you know.'</p>
     <p>Mary was silent, and, next time she spoke, it was to hope that Ethel would tell the
      Cocksmoor children about Una.</p>
     <p>Ethel was obliged to dress, and go down-stairs to tea. Her father seemed to have been
      watching for her, with his study door open, for he came to meet her, took her hand, and said,
      in a low voice, 'My dear child, I wish you joy. This will be a pleasant message, to bid poor
      Ritchie good speed for his Ordination, will it not?'</p>
     <p>'That it will, papa—'</p>
     <p>'Why, Ethel, have you been crying over it all this time?' said he, struck by the sadness of
      her voice.</p>
     <p>'Many other things, papa. I am so unworthy—but it was not our doing—but the grace—'</p>
     <p>'No, but thankful you may be, to have been the means of awakening the grace!'</p>
     <p>Ethel's lips trembled. 'And, oh, papa! coming to-day, when I
      <pb n="375"/> have been behaving so ill to you, and Miss Bracy, and Flora, and all.'</p>
     <p>'Have you? I did not know you had behaved ill to me.'</p>
     <p>'About Miss Bracy—I thought wrong things, if I did not say them. To her, I believe, I said
      what was true, though it was harsh of me to say it, and—'</p>
     <p>'What? about pride and temper? It was true, and I hope it will do her good. Cure a piping
      turkey with a pepper-corn sometimes. I have spoken to her, and told her to pluck up a little
      spirit; not fancy affronts, and not to pester you with them. Poor child! you have been sadly
      victimized to-day and yesterday. No wonder you were bored past patience, with that absured
      rabble of women!'</p>
     <p>'It was all my own selfish, distrustful temper, wanting to have Cocksmoor taken care of in
      my own way, and angry at being interfered with. I see it now—and here this poor girl, that I
      thought thrown away—'</p>
     <p>'Aye, Ethel, you will often see the like. The main object may fail or fall short, but the
      earnest pains-taking will always be blessed some way or other, and where we thought it most
      wasted, some fresh green shoot will spring up, to show it is not we that give the increase. I
      suppose you will write to Richard with this?'</p>
     <p>'That I shall.'</p>
     <p>'Then you may send this with it. Tell him my arm is tired and stiff to-day, or I would have
      said more. He must answer the Clergyman's letter.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May gave Ethel his sheet not folded. His written words were now so few as to be
      cherished amongst his children.</p>
     <p>Dear Richard,</p>
     <p>May all your ministerial works be as blessed as this, your first labour of love. I give you
      hearty joy of this strengthening blessing.—Mine goes with it—'only be strong and of a good
      courage!'</p>
     <p>Your affectionate Father,</p>
     <p><hi>R. May.</hi></p>
     <p>P.S. Margaret does not gain ground this summer—you must soon come home and cheer her.</p>

      <l>As late, engaged by fancy's dream,</l>
      <l>I lay beside a rapid stream,</l>
      <l>I saw my first come gliding by,</l>
      <l>Its airy form soon caught my eye;</l>
      <l>Its texture frail, and colour various,</l>
      <l>Like human hopes, and life precarious.</l>
      <l>Sudden, my second caught my ear,</l>
      <l>And filled my soul with instant fear;</l>
      <l>I quickly rose, and home I ran,</l>
      <l>My whole was hissing in the pan.</l><p><hi>Riddle.</hi></p></quote>
     <p>Flora revised the letter to the Principal, and the Ladies' Committee approved,
      after having proposed seven amendments, all of which Flora caused to topple over by their own
      weakness.</p>
     <p>After interval sufficient to render the nine ladies very anxious, the Principal wrote from
      Scotland, where he was spending the Long Vacation, and informed them that their request should
      be laid before the next College meeting.</p>
     <p>After the Committee had sat upon this letter, the two sisters walked home in much greater
      harmony than after the former meeting. Etheldred had recovered her candour, and was willing to
      own that it was not art, but good sense, that gave her sister so much ascendancy. She began to
      be hopeful, and to declare that Flora might yet do something even with the ladies. Flora was
      gratified by the approval that no one in the house could help valuing; 'Positively,' said
      Flora, 'I believe I may in time. You see there are different ways of acting, as an authority,
      or as an equal.'</p>
     <p>'The authority can move from without, the equal must from within,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Just so. We must circumvent their prejudices, instead of trying to beat them down.'</p>
     <p>'If you only could have the proper Catechizing restored!'</p>
     <p>'Wait; you will see. Let me feel my ground.'</p>
     <p>'Or if we could only abdicate into the hands of the rightful power!'</p>
     <p>'The rightful power would not be much obliged to you.'</p>
     <p>'That is the worst of it,' said Ethel. 'It is sad to hear the sick people say that Dr. May
      is more to them than any parson; it shews that they have so entirely lost the notion of what
      their Clergyman should be.'</p>
     <pb n="377"/>
     <p>'Dr. May is <hi>the</hi> man most looked up to in the town,' said Flora, and that gives
      weight to us in the Committee, but it is all in the using.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, hesitating.</p>
     <p>'You see, we have the <hi>prestige</hi> of better birth, and better education, as well as of
      having the chief property in the town, and of being the largest subscribers, added to his
      personal character,' said Flora; 'so that everything conspires to render us leaders, and our
      age alone prevented us from assuming our post sooner.'</p>
     <p>They were at home by this time, and, entering the hall, perceived that the whole party were
      in the lawn. The consolation of the children for the departure of Hector and Tom, was a bowl
      of soapsuds and some tobacco pipes, and they had collected the house to admire and assist;
      even Margaret's couch being drawn close to the window.</p>
     <p>Bubbles are one of the most fascinating of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven
      snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow "a honeycomb," holding the bowl of the
      pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger,
      clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until
      Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff
      enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it
      away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with
      swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused
      assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing
      down on either side, bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree.
      Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a
      peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing
      house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson,
      and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in
      silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze,
      with a tardy, graceful uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks
      at her empty fingers with a puzzled "All gone!" as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at
      them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the
      kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.</p>
     <p>Even the grave Norman is drawn in. He agrees with Mary that bubbles used to fly over the
      wall, and that one once went into
      <pb n="378"/> Mrs. Richardson's garret window, when her housemaid tried to catch it with a
      pair of tongs, and then ran down-stairs screaming that there was a ghost in her room; but that
      was in Harry's time, the heroic age of the May nursery.</p>
     <p>He accepts a pipe, and his greater height raises it into a favourable current of air—the
      glistening balloon sails off. It flies, it soars; no, it is coming down! The children shout at
      it, as if to drive it up, but it wilfully descends—they rush beneath, they try to waft it on
      high with their breath—there is a collision between Mary and Blanche—Aubrey perceives a taste
      of soapy water—the bubble is no more—it has vanished in his open mouth!</p>
     <p>Papa himself has taken a pipe, and the little ones are mounted on chairs, to be on a level
      with their tall elders. A painted globe is swimming along, hesitating at first, but the
      dancing motion is tending upwards, the rainbow tints glisten in the sunlight—all rush to
      assist it; if breath of the lips can uphold it, it should rise, indeed! Up! above the wall!
      over Mrs. Richardson's elm, over the topmost branch—hurra! out of sight! Margaret adds her
      voice to the acclamations. Beat that if you can, Mary! That doubtful wind keeps yours
      suspended in a graceful minuet; its pace is accelerated —but earthwards! it has committed
      self-destruction by running foul of a rose-bush. A general blank!</p>
     <p>'You here, Ethel?' said Norman, as the elders laughed at each other's baffled faces.</p>
     <p>'I am more surprised to find you here,' she answered.</p>
     <p>'Excitement!' said Norman, smiling; one cause is as good as another for it.'</p>
     <p>'Very pretty sport,' said Dr. May. 'You should write a poem on it, Norman.'</p>
     <p>'It is an exhausted subject,' said Norman; 'bubble and trouble are too obvious a rhyme.'</p>
     <p>'Ha! there it goes! It will be over the house! That's right!' Everyone joined in the
      outcry.</p>
     <p>'Whose is it?'</p>
     <p>'Blanche's—'</p>
     <p>'Hurrah for Blanche! Well done, white Mayflower, there!' said the Doctor, 'that is what I
      meant. See the applause gained by a proud bubble that flies! Don't we all bow down to it, and
      waft it up with the whole force of our lungs, air as it is; and when it fairly goes out of
      sight, is there any exhilaration or applause that surpasses ours?'</p>
     <p>'The whole world being bent on making painted bubbles fly over the house,' said Norman, far
      more thoughtfully than his father. 'It is a fair pattern of life and fame.'</p>
     <pb n="379"/>
     <p>'I was thinking,' continued Dr. May, 'what was the most unalloyed exultation, I
      remember.'</p>
     <p>'Harry's, when you were made Dux,' whispered Ethel to her brother.</p>
     <p>'Not mine,' said Norman, briefly.</p>
     <p>'I believe,' said Dr. May, 'I never knew such glorification as when Aubrey Spencer climbed
      the poor old market-cross. We all felt ourselves made illustrious for ever in his person.'</p>
     <p>'Nay, papa, when you got that gold medal must have been the grandest time?' said Blanche,
      who had been listening.</p>
     <p>Dr. May laughed, and patted her. 'I, Blanche? Why, I was excessively amazed, that is all,
      not in Norman's way, but I had been doing next to nothing to the very last, then fell into an
      agony, and worked like a horse, thinking myself sure of failure, and that my mother and my
      uncles would break their hearts.'</p>
     <p>'But when you heard that you had it?' persisted Blanche.</p>
     <p>'Why, then I found I must be a much cleverer fellow than I thought for!' said he, laughing;
      'but I was ashamed of myself, and of the authorities, for choosing such an idle dog, and vexed
      that other plodding lads missed it, who deserved it more than I.'</p>
     <p>'Of course,' said Norman, in a low voice, 'that is what one always feels. I had rather blow
      soap-bubbles!'</p>
     <p>'Where was Dr. Spencer?' asked Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Not competing. He had been ready a year before, and had gained it, or I should have had no
      chance. Poor Spencer! what would I not give to see him, or hear of him?'</p>
     <p>'The last was—how long ago?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Six years, when he was setting off, to return from Poonshedagore,' said Dr. May, sighing.
      'I give him up; his health was broken, and there was no one to look after him. He was the sort
      of man to have a nameless grave, and a name too blessed for fame.'</p>
     <p>Ethel would have asked further of her father's dear old friend, but there were sounds,
      denoting an arrival, and Margaret beckoned to them, as Miss Rivers, and her brother, were
      ushered into the drawing-room; and Blanche instantly fled away, with her basin, to hide
      herself in the school-room.</p>
     <p>Meta skipped out, and soon was established on the grass, an attraction to all the live
      creatures, as it seemed; for the kitten came, and was caressed, till her own graceful Nipen
      was ready to fight with the uncouth Toby, for the possession of a resting-place on the skirt
      of her habit, while Daisy nestled up to her, as claiming a privilege, and Aubrey kept guard
      over the dogs.</p>
     <p>Meta enquired after a huge doll—Dr. Hoxton's gift to Daisy, at the bazaar.</p>
     <pb n="380"/>
     <p>'She is in Margaret's wardrobe,' was the answer, 'because Aubrey tied her hands behind her,
      and was going to offer her up on the nursery grate.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Aubrey, that was too cruel!'</p>
     <p>'No,' returned Aubrey; 'she was Iphigenia, going to be sacrificed.'</p>
     <p>'Mary unconsciously acted Diana,' said Ethel, 'and bore the victim away.'</p>
     <p>'Pray, was Daisy a willing Clytemnestra?' asked Meta.</p>
     <p>'Oh, yes, she liked it,' said Aubrey, while Meta looked discomfited.</p>
     <p>'I never could get proper respect paid to dolls,' said Margaret; 'we deal too much in their
      natural enemies.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel,'my only doll was like a heraldic lion, couped in all her parts.'</p>
     <p>'Harry and Tom once made a general execution,' said Flora; 'there was a doll hanging to
      every baluster—the number made up with rag.'</p>
     <p>George Rivers burst out laughing—his first sign of life; and Meta looked as if she had heard
      of so many murders.'</p>
     <p>'I can't help feeling for a doll!' she said. 'They used to be like sisters to me. I feel as
      if they were wasted on children, that see no character in them, and only call them Dolly.'</p>
     <p>'I agree with you,' said Margaret. 'If there had been no live dolls, Richard and I should
      have reared our doll family as judiciously as tenderly. There are treasures of carpentry still
      extant, that he made for them.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! I am so glad!' cried Meta, as if she had found another point of union. 'If I were to
      confess—there is a dear old Rose in the secret recesses of my wardrobe. I could as soon throw
      away my sister—'</p>
     <p>'Ha!' cried her brother, laying hold of the child,'here, little Daisy, will you give your
      doll to Meta?'</p>
     <p>'My name is Gertrude Margaret May,' said the little round mouth. The fat arm was drawn back,
      with all a baby's dignity, and the rosy face was hidden in Dr. May's breast, at the sound of
      George Rivers's broad laugh, and, 'Well done, little one!'</p>
     <p>Dr. May put his arm round her, turned aside from him, and began talking to Meta about Mr.
      Rivers.</p>
     <p>Flora and Norman made conversation for the brother; and he presently asked Norman to go out
      shooting with him; but, looked so amazed on hearing that Norman was no sportsman, that Flora
      tried to save the family credit, by mentioning Hector's love of a gun, which caused their
      guest to make a general tender of sporting
      <pb n="381"/> privileges; 'Though,' added he, with a drawl, 'shooting is rather a nuisance,
      especially alone.'</p>
     <p>Meta told Ethel, a little apart, that he was so tired of going out alone, that he had
      brought her here, in search of a companion.</p>
     <p>'He comes in at eleven o'clock, poor fellow, quite tired with solitude,' said she, 'and
      comes to me to be entertained.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed,' exclaimed Ethel. 'What can you do?'</p>
     <p>'What I can,' said Meta, laughing. 'Whatever is not "a horrid nuisance" to him.'</p>
     <p>'It would be a horrid nuisance to me,' said Ethel, bluntly, 'if my brothers wanted me to
      amuse them all the morning.'</p>
     <p>'Your brothers, oh!' said Meta, as if that were very different; 'besides, you have so much
      more to do. I am only too glad and grateful, when George will come to me at all. You see, I
      have always been too young to be his companion, or find out what suited him, and now he is so
      very kind and good-natured to me.'</p>
     <p>'But what becomes of your business?'</p>
     <p>'I get time, one way or another. There is the evening, very often, when I have sung both him
      and papa to sleep. I had two hours, all to myself, yesterday night,' said Meta, with a look of
      congratulation, 'and I had a famous reading of "Thirlwall's Greece."'</p>
     <p>'I should think that such evenings were as bad as the mornings.'</p>
     <p>'Come, Ethel, don't make me naughty. Large families, like yours, may have merry, sociable
      evenings; but, I do assure you, ours are very pleasant. We are so pleased to have George at
      home; and we really hope that he is taking a fancy to the dear Grange. You can't think how
      delighted papa is, to have him content to stay quietly with us so long. I must call him, to go
      back now, though, or papa will be kept waiting.'</p>
     <p>When Ethel had watched the tall, ponderous brother help the bright fairy sister to fly
      airily into her saddle, and her sparkling glance,' and wave of the hand, as she cantered off,
      contrasting with his slow bend, and immobility of feature, she could not help saying that
      Meta's life certainly was not too charming, with her fanciful, valetudinarian father, and that
      stupid, idealess brother.</p>
     <p>'He is very amiable and good-natured,' interposed Norman.</p>
     <p>'Ha! Norman, you are quite won by his invitation to shoot! How he despised you for
      refusing—as much as you despised him.'</p>
     <p>'Speak for yourself,' said Norman. 'You fancy no sensible man likes shooting, but you are
      all wrong. Some of our best men are capital sportsmen. Why, there is Ogilvie—you know what he
      is, When I bring him down here, you will see that there is no sort of sport that he is not
      keen after.'</p>
     <pb n="382"/>
     <p>'This poor fellow will never be keen after anything,' said Dr. May. 'I pity him! Existence
      seems hard work to him!'</p>
     <p>'We shall have baby calling him "the detestable" next,' said Ethel. 'What a famous set down
      she gave him.'</p>
     <p>'She is a thorough lady, and allows no liberties,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Ah!' said Margaret, 'it is a proof of what I want to impress on you. We really must leave
      off calling her Daisy, when strangers are there.'</p>
     <p>'It is so much nicer,' pleaded Mary.</p>
     <p>'The very reason,' said Margaret, 'fondling names should be kept for our innermost selves,
      not spread abroad, and made common. I remember when I used to be called Peg-top—and Flora,
      Flossy— we were never allowed to use the names, when any visitor was near; and we were asked
      if we could not be as fond of each other by our proper names. I think it was felt that there
      was a want of reserve, in publishing our pet words to other people.'</p>
     <p>'Quite true,' said Dr. May; 'baby-names never ought to go beyond home. It is the fashion to
      use them now; and, besides the folly, it seems, to me, an absolute injury to a girl, to let
      her grow up, with a nick-name attached to her.'</p>
     <p>'Aye!' chimed in Norman, 'I hear men talking of Henny, and Loo, and the like; and you can't
      think how glad I have been, that my sisters could not be known by any absurd word!'</p>
     <p>'It is a case, where self-respect would make others behave properly,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'True,' said Dr. May; 'but if girls won't keep up their own dignity, their friends' duty is
      to do it for them. The mischief is in the intimate friends, who blazon the words to
      everyone.'</p>
     <p>'And then they call one formal, for trying to protect the right name,' said Flora. 'It is,
      one-half of it, silliness, and, the other, affectation of intimacy.'</p>
     <p>'Now, I know,' said Mary, 'why you are so careful to call Meta Miss Rivers, to all the
      people here.'</p>
     <p>'I should hope so!' cried Norman, indignantly.</p>
     <p>'Why, yes, Mary,' said Margaret, 'I should hope lady-like feeling would prevent you from
      calling her Meta before—'</p>
     <p>'The Andersons!' cried Ethel, laughing. 'Margaret was just going to say it. We only want
      Harry, to exact the forfeit! Poor dear little humming bird! It gives one an oppression on the
      chest, to think of her having that great do-nothing brother on her hands all day.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, said Norman, 'I shall know where I am not to look when I want a sister.'</p>
     <p>'Aye,' said Ethel, 'when you come yawning to me to find amusement for you, you will see what
      I shall do!'</p>
     <pb n="383"/>
     <p>'Stand over me with a stick while I print A B C for Cocksmoor, I suppose,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Well! why not? People are much better doing something than nothing.'</p>
     <p>'What, you won't even let me blow bubbles!' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'That is too intellectual, as papa makes it,' said Ethel. 'By-the-by, Norman,' she added, as
      she had now walked with him a little apart, 'it always was a bubble of mine that you should
      try for the Newdigate Prize. Ha?' as the colour rushed into his cheeks, 'you really have
      begun!'</p>
     <p>'I could not help it, when I heard the subject given out for next year. Our old friend,
      Decius Mus.'</p>
     <p>'Have you finished?'</p>
     <p>'By no means, but it brought a world of notions into my head, such as I could not but set
      down. Now, Ethel, do oblige me, do write another, as we used in old times.'</p>
     <p>'I had better not,' said Ethel, standing thoughtful. 'If I throw myself into it, I shall
      hate everything else, and my wits will be wool-gathering. I have neither time nor poetry
      enough.'</p>
     <p>'You used to write English Verse.'</p>
     <p>'I was cured of it.'</p>
     <p>'How?'</p>
     <p>'I wanted money for Cocksmoor, and, after persuading papa, I got leave to send a ballad
      about a little girl, and a white rose, to that school magazine. I don't think papa liked it,
      but there were some verses that touched him, and one had seen worse. It was actually inserted,
      and I was in high feather, till, oh! Norman! imagine Richard getting hold of this unlucky
      thing, without a notion where it came from. Margaret put it before him, to see what he would
      say to it.'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid it was not like a young lady's anonymous composition in a story.'</p>
     <p>'By no means. Imagine Ritchie picking my poor metaphors to pieces, and weighing every
      sentimental line! And all in his dear old simplicity, because he wanted to understand it,
      seeing that Margaret liked it. He had not the least intention of hurting my feelings, but
      never was I so annihilated! I thought he was doing it on purpose, till I saw how distressed he
      was when he found it out; and, worse than all was, his saying at the end, that he supposed it
      was very fine, but he could not understand it.'</p>
     <p>'Let me see it.'</p>
     <p>'Some time or other; but let me see Decius.'</p>
     <p>'Did you give up verses because Richard could not understand them?'</p>
     <p>'No; because I had other fish to fry. And I have not given them
      <pb n="384"/> up altogether. I do scrabble down things that tease me by running in my head,
      when I want to clear my brains, and know what I mean; but I can't do it without sitting up at
      night, and that stupifies me before breakfast. And as to making bubbles of them, Ritchie has
      cured me of that!'</p>
     <p>'It is a pity!' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Nonsense, let me see Decius. I know he is splendid.'</p>
     <p>'I wish you would have tried, for all my best ideas are stolen from you.'</p>
     <p>Ethel prevailed by following her brother to his room, and perching herself on the
      window-sill, while he read his performance from many slips of paper. The visions of those
      boyish days had not been forgotten, the Vesuvius scenery was much as Ethel had once described
      it, but with far more force and beauty; there was Decius' impassioned address to the beauteous
      land he was about to leave, and the remembrances of his Roman hearth, his farm, his children,
      whom he quitted for the pale shadows of an uncertain Elysium. There was a great hiatus in the
      middle, and Norman had many more authorities to consult, but the summing up was nearly
      complete, and Ethel thought the last lines grand, as they spoke of the noble consul's name
      living for evermore, added to the examples that nerve ardent souls to devote life, and all
      that is precious, to the call of duty. Fame is not their object. She may crown their pale
      brows, but for the good of others, not their own, a beacon light to the world. Self is no
      object of theirs, and it is the casting self behind that wins—not always the visible earthly
      strife, but the combat between good and evil. They are the true victors, and whether
      chronicled, or forgotten, true glory rests on their heads, the sole true glory that man can
      attain, namely, the reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of Him whom Decius knew
      not— the Prince who gave himself for His people, and thus rendered death, for Truth's sake,
      the highest boon to mortal man.</p>
     <p>'Norman, you must finish it! When will it be given in?'</p>
     <p>'Next spring, if at all, but keep the secret, Ethel. I cannot have my father's hopes
      raised.'</p>
     <p>'I'll tell you of a motto,' said Ethel. 'Do you remember Mrs. Hemans mention of a saying of
      Sir Walter Scott—"Never let me hear that brave blood has been shed in vain. It sends a roaring
      voice down through all time."'</p>
     <p>'If—' said Norman, rather ashamed of the enthusiasm which, almost approaching to the
      so-called "funny state," of his younger days, had trembled in his voice, and kindled his eye,
      'if you won't let me put " <hi>nascitur ridiculus mus</hi> ."</p>
     <pb n="385"/>
     <p>'Too obvious,' said Ethel. 'Depend upon it every undergraduate has thought of it
      already.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was always very happy over Norman's secrets, and went about smiling over Decius, and
      comparing <hi>her</hi> brother with such a one as poor Meta was afflicted with; wasting some
      superfluous pity and contempt on the weary weight that was inflicted on the Grange.</p>
     <p>'What do you think of me?' said Margaret, one afternoon. 'I have had Mr. George Rivers here
      for two hours.'</p>
     <p>'Alone! what could bring him here?'</p>
     <p>'I told him that everyone was out, but he chose to sit down, and seemed to be waiting.'</p>
     <p>'How could you get on?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! we asked a few questions, and brought out remarks, with great difficulty, at long
      intervals. He asked me if lying here was not a great nuisance, and, at last, he grew tired of
      twisting his moustache, and went away.'</p>
     <p>'I trust it was a call to take leave.'</p>
     <p>'No, he thinks he shall sell out, for the army is a great nuisance.'</p>
     <p>'You seem to have got into his confidence.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, he said he wanted to settle down, but living with one's father was such a
      nuisance.'</p>
     <p>'By-the-by!' cried Ethel, laughing. 'Margaret, it strikes me that this is a Dumbiedikes'
      courtship!'</p>
     <p>'Of yourself?' said Margaret, slyly.</p>
     <p>'No, of Flora. You know, she has often met him at the Grange and other places, and she does
      contrive to amuse him, and make him almost animated. I should not think he found her a great
      nuisance.'</p>
     <p>'Poor man! I am sorry for him!' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Oh! rejection will be very good for him, and give him something to think of.'</p>
     <p>'Flora will never let it come to that,' said Margaret. 'But not one word about it,
      Ethel!'</p>
     <p>Margaret and Etheldred kept their eyes open, and sometimes imagined, sometimes laughed at
      themselves for their speculations, and so October began; and Ethel laughed, as she questioned
      whether the Grange would feel the Hussar's return to his quarters, as much as home would the
      departure of their scholar for Balliol.</p>

     <p>Flora and Norman were dining with one of their county acquaintance, and Dr. May had
      undertaken to admit them on their return. The fire shone red and bright, as it sank calmly
      away, and the time-piece and clock on the stairs had begun their nightly duett off ticking,
      the crickets chirped in the kitchen, and the Doctor sat alone. His book lay with unturned
      pages, as he sat musing, with eyes fixed on the fire, living over again his own life, the easy
      bright days of his youth, when, without much pains on his own part, the tendencies of his
      generous affectionate disposition, and the influences of a warm friendship, and an early
      attachment, had guarded him from evil—then the period when he had been perfectly happy, and
      the sobering power of his position had been gradually working on him; but though always
      religious and highly principled, the very goodness of his natural character preventing him
      from perceiving the need of self-control, until the shock that changed the whole tenor of his
      life, and left him, for the first time, sensible of his own responsibility, but, with
      inveterate habits of heedlessness and hastiness, that love alone gave him force to combat. He
      was now a far gentler man. His younger children had never seen, his elder had long since
      forgotten, his occasional bursts of temper, but he suffered keenly from their effects,
      especially as regarded some of his children. Though Richard's timidity had been overcome, and
      Tom's more serious failures had been remedied, he was not without anxiety, and had a strange
      unsatisfactory feeling as regarded Flora. He could not feel that he had fathomed her! She
      reminded him of his old Scottish father-in-law, Professor Mackenzie, whom he had never
      understood, nor, if the truth were known, liked. Her dealings with the Ladies' Committee were
      so like her grandfather's canny ways in a public meeting, that he laughed over them—but they
      were not congenial to him. Flora was a most valuable person; all that she undertook prospered,
      and he depended entirely on her for household affairs, and for the care of Margaret; but,
      highly as he
      <pb n="387"/> esteemed her, he was a little afraid of her cool prudence; she never seemed to
      be in any need of him, nor to place any confidence in him, and seemed altogether, so much
      older and wiser than he could feel himself—pretty girl as she was—and very pretty were her
      fine blue eyes and clear skin, set off by her dark brown hair. There arose the vision of eyes
      as blue, skin as clear, but of light blonde locks, and shorter, rounder, more dove-like form,
      open simple loving face, and serene expression, that had gone straight to his heart, when he
      first saw Maggie Mackenzie making tea.</p>
     <p>He heard the wheels, and went out to unbolt the door. Those were a pair for a father to be
      proud of—Norman, of fine stature, and noble looks, with his high brow, clear thoughtful eye,
      and grave intellectual eagle face, lighting into animation with his rare, sweet smile; and
      Flora, so tall and graceful, and in her white dress, picturesquely half-concealed by her
      mantle, with flowers in her hair, and a deepened colour in her cheek, was a fair vision, as
      she came in from the darkness.</p>
     <p>'Well! was it a pleasant party?'</p>
     <p>Norman related the circumstances, while his sister remained silently leaning against the
      mantel-piece; looking into the fire, until he took up his candle, and bade them good night.
      Dr. May was about to do the same, when she held out her hand. 'One moment, if you please, dear
      papa,' she said—'I think you ought to know it.'</p>
     <p>'What, my dear?'</p>
     <p>'Mr. George Rivers, papa—'</p>
     <p>'Ha!' said Dr. May, beginning to smile. 'So that is what he is at, is it? But what an
      opportunity to take.'</p>
     <p>'It was in the conservatory,' said Flora—a little hurt, as her father discovered by her
      tone. 'The music was going on, and I don't know that there could have been—'</p>
     <p>'A better opportunity, eh?' said Dr. May, laughing; 'well, <hi>I</hi> should have thought it
      awkward; was he very much discomposed?'</p>
     <p>'I thought,' said Flora, looking down and hesitating, 'that he had better come to you.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed! so you shifted the ungracious office to me. I am very glad to spare you, my dear;
      but it was hard on him to raise his hopes.'</p>
     <p>'I thought,' faltered Flora, 'that you could not disapprove—'</p>
     <p>'Flora—' and he paused completely confounded, while his daughter was no less surprised at
      the manner in which her news was received. Each waited for the other to speak, and Flora
      turned away, resting her head against the mantel-piece.</p>
     <p>'Surely,' said he, laying his hand on her shoulder, 'you do not mean that you like this
      man.'</p>
     <pb n="388"/>
     <p>'I did not think that you would be against it,' said Flora, in a choked voice, her face
      still averted.</p>
     <p>'Heaven knows, I would not be against anything for your happiness, my dear,' he answered;
      'but have you considered what it would be to spend your life with a man that has not three
      ideas; not a resource for occupying himself—a regular prey to <hi>ennui</hi> —one whom you
      could never respect!' He had grown more and more vehement—and Flora put her handkerchief to
      her eyes, for tears of actual disappointment were flowing.</p>
     <p>'Come, come,' he said, touched, but turning it off by a smile, 'we will not talk of it any
      more to-night.—It is your first offer, and you are flattered, but we know "Colours seen by
      candle-light, Will not bear the light of day." There, good night, Flora, my dear—we will have
      a <hi>tête à tête</hi> in the study before breakfast, when you have had time to look into your
      own mind.'</p>
     <p>He kissed her affectionately, and went up-stairs with her, stopping at her door to give her
      another embrace, and to say, 'Bless you, my dear child, and help you to come to a right
      decision—'</p>
     <p>Flora was disappointed. She had been too highly pleased at her conquest to make any clear
      estimation of the prize, individually considered. Her vanity magnified her achievement, and
      she had come home in a flutter of pleasure, at having had such a position in society offered
      to her, and expecting that her whole family would share her triumph. Gratified by George
      Rivers's admiration, she regarded him with favour and complacency; and her habit of
      considering herself as the most sensible person in her sphere, made her so regard his
      appreciation of her, that she was blinded to his inferiority. It must be allowed, that he was
      less dull with her than with most others.</p>
     <p>And, in the midst of her glory, when she expected her father to be delighted and grateful—to
      be received as a silly girl, ready to accept any proposal, her lover spoken of with scorn, and
      the advantages of the match utterly passed over, was almost beyond endurance. A physician,
      with eleven children dependent on his practice, to despise an offer from the heir of such a
      fortune! But that was his customary romance! She forgave him, when it occurred to her that she
      was too important, and valuable, to be easily spared; and a tenderness thrilled through her,
      as she looked at the sleeping Margaret's pale face, and thought of surrendering her and little
      Daisy to Ethel's keeping. And what would become of the house-keeping? She decided, however,
      that feelings must not sway her— out of six sisters some must marry, for the good of the rest.
      Blanche
      <pb n="389"/> and Daisy should come and stay with her, to be formed by the best society; and,
      as to poor dear Ethel, Mrs. Rivers would rule the Ladies' Committee for her with a high hand,
      and, perhaps, provide Cocksmoor with a school at her sole expense. What a useful, admirable
      woman she would be! The Doctor would be the person to come to his senses in the morning, when
      he remembered Abbotstoke, Mr. Rivers, and Meta.</p>
     <p>So Flora met her father, the next morning, with all her ordinary composure, in which he
      could not rival her, after his sleepless, anxious night. His looks of affectionate solicitude
      disconcerted what she had intended to say, and she waited, with downcast eyes, for him to
      begin.</p>
     <p>'Well, Flora,' he said, at last, 'have you thought?'</p>
     <p>'Do you know any cause against it?' said Flora, still looking down.</p>
     <p>'I know almost nothing of him. I have never heard anything of his character, or conduct.
      Those would be a subject of enquiry, if you wish to carry this on—'</p>
     <p>'I see you are averse,' said Flora. 'I would do nothing against your wishes—'</p>
     <p>'My wishes have nothing to do with it,' said Dr. May. 'The point is—that I must do right, as
      far as I can, as well as try to secure your happiness; and I want to be sure that you know
      what you are about.'</p>
     <p>'I know he is not clever,' said Flora; 'but there may be many solid qualities without
      talent.'</p>
     <p>'I am the last person to deny it; but where are these solid qualities? I cannot see the
      recommendation!'</p>
     <p>'I place myself in your hands,' said Flora, in a submissive tone, which had the effect of
      making him lose patience.</p>
     <p>'Flora, Flora! why will you talk as if I were sacrificing you to some dislike or prejudice
      of my own! Don't you think I should only rejoice, to have such a prosperous home offered to
      you, if only the man were worthy?'</p>
     <p>'If you do not think him so, of course, there is an end of it,' said Flora, and her voice
      shewed suppressed emotion.</p>
     <p>'It is not what I think, in the absence of proof, but what you think, Flora. What I want you
      to do is this—to consider the matter fairly. Compare him with—I'll not say with Norman—but
      with Richard, Alan, Mr. Wilmot. Do you think you could rely on him —come to him for advice?'
      (Flora never did come to anyone for advice). 'Above all—do you think him likely to be a help,
      or a hindrance, in doing right?'</p>
     <p>'I think you under-rate him,' said Flora, steadily; 'but, of
      <pb n="390"/> course, if you dislike it—though, I think, you would change your mind, if you
      knew him better—'</p>
     <p>'Well!' he said, as if to himself, 'It is not always the most worthy—' then continued, 'I
      have no dislike to him. Perhaps I may find that you are right. Since your mind is made up, I
      will do this: first, we must be assured of his father's consent, for they may very fairly
      object, since, what I can give you, is a mere nothing to them. Next, I shall find out what
      character he bears in his regiment, and watch him well myself; and, if nothing appear
      seriously amiss, I will not withhold my consent. But, Flora, you should still consider whether
      he shows such principle, and right feeling, as you can trust to.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, papa. I know you will do all that is kind.'</p>
     <p>'Mind, you must not consider it an engagement, unless all be satisfactory.'</p>
     <p>'I will do as you please.'</p>
     <p>Ethel perceived that something was in agitation, but the fact did not break upon her till
      she came to Margaret, after the school-room reading, and heard Dr. May declaiming away, in the
      vehement manner, that always relieved him.</p>
     <p>'Such a cub!' These were the words that met her ear; and she would have gone away, but he
      called her—'Come in, Ethel; Margaret says, you guessed at this affair!'</p>
     <p>'At what affair!' exclaimed Ethel. 'Oh, it is about Flora. Poor man; has he done it?'</p>
     <p>'Poor! He is not the one to be pitied!' said her father.</p>
     <p>'You don't mean that she likes him?'</p>
     <p>'She does though! A fellow with no more brains than a turnip lantern!'</p>
     <p>'She does not mean it?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes she does! Very submissive, and proper spoken, of course, but bent on having him; so
      there is nothing left for me but to consent —provided Mr. Rivers does, and he should turn out
      not to have done anything outrageous; but there's no hope of that—he has not the energy. What
      can possess her? What can she see to admire?'</p>
     <p>'He is good-natured,' said Margaret, 'and rather good-looking—'</p>
     <p>'Flora has more sense. What on earth can be the attraction?'</p>
     <p>'I am afraid it is partly the grandeur—' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>She broke off short, quite dismayed at the emotion she had excited. Dr. May stepped towards
      her, almost as if he could have shaken her.</p>
     <pb n="391"/>
     <p>'Ethel!' he cried, 'I won't have such motives ascribed to your sister!'</p>
     <p>Ethel tried to recollect what she had said that was so shocking, for the idea of Flora's
      worldly motives was no novelty to her. They had appeared in too many instances; and, though
      frightened at his anger, she stood still, without unsaying her words.</p>
     <p>Margaret began to explain away. 'Ethel did not mean, dear papa—'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Dr. May, his passionate manner giving way to dejection. 'The truth is, that I
      have made home so dreary, that my girls are ready to take the first means of escaping.'</p>
     <p>Poor Margaret's tears sprang forth, and, looking up imploringly, she exclaimed, 'Oh, papa,
      papa! it was no want of happiness! I could not help it. You know he had come before—'</p>
     <p>Any reproach to her had been entirely remote from his thoughts, and he was at once on his
      knee beside her, soothing and caressing, begging her pardon, and recalling whatever she could
      thus have interpreted.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, Ethel stood unnoticed and silent, making no outward protestation, but with lips
      compressed, as in her heart of hearts, she passed the resolution—that her father should never
      feel this pain on her account. Leave him who might, she would never forsake him; nothing but
      the will of Heaven should part them. It might be hasty and venturesome. She knew not what it
      might cost her; but, where Ethel had treasured her resolve to work for Cocksmoor, there she
      also laid up her secret vow—that no earthly object should be placed between her and her
      father.</p>
     <p>The ebullition of feeling seemed to have restored Dr. May's calmness, and he rose, saying,
      'I must go to my work; the man is coming here this afternoon.'</p>
     <p>'Where shall you see him?' Margaret asked.</p>
     <p>'In my study, I suppose. I fear there is no chance of Flora's changing her mind first. Or do
      you think one of you could talk to her, and get her fairly to contemplate the real bearings of
      the matter—' and, with these words, he left the room.</p>
     <p>Margaret and Ethel glanced at each other; and both felt the impenetrability of Flora's
      nature, so smooth, that all thrusts glided off.</p>
     <p>'It will be of no use,' said Ethel; 'and, what is more, she will not have it done.'</p>
     <p>'Pray try; a few of your forcible words would set it in a new light.'</p>
     <p>'Why! Do you think she will attend to me, when she has not chosen to heed papa?' said Ethel,
      with an emphasis of incredulity. 'No; whatever Flora does, is done deliberately, and
      unalterably.'</p>
     <pb n="392"/>
     <p>'Still, I don't know whether it is not our duty,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'More yours than mine,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>Margaret flushed up. 'Oh, no, I cannot!' she said, always timid, and slightly defective in
      moral courage. She looked so nervous and shaken by the bare idea of a remonstrance with Flora,
      that Ethel could not press her; and, though convinced that her representation would be
      useless, she owned that her conscience would rest better, after she had spoken. 'But there is
      Flora, walking in the garden with Norman,' she said. 'No doubt, he is doing it.'</p>
     <p>So Ethel let it rest, and attended to the children's lessons, during which Flora came into
      the drawing-room, and practised her music, as if nothing had happened.</p>
     <p>Before the morning was over, Ethel contrived to visit Norman, in the dining-room, where he
      was wont to study, and asked him whether he had made any impression on Flora.</p>
     <p>'What impression do you mean?'</p>
     <p>'Why, about this concern,' said Ethel; 'this terrible man, that makes papa so unhappy.'</p>
     <p>'Papa unhappy! Why, what does he know against him? I thought the Riverses were his peculiar
      pets.'</p>
     <p>'The Riverses! As if, because one liked the sparkling stream, one must like a muddy
      ditch.'</p>
     <p>'What harm do you know of him?' said Norman, with much surprise, and anxiety, as if he
      feared that he had been doing wrong, in ignorance.</p>
     <p>'Harm! Is he not a regular oaf?'</p>
     <p>'My dear Ethel, if you wait to marry till you find some one as clever as yourself, you will
      wait long enough.</p>
     <p>'I don't think it right for a woman to marry a man decidedly her inferior.'</p>
     <p>'We have all learnt to think much too highly of talent,' said Norman, gravely.</p>
     <p>'I don't care for mere talent—people are generally more sensible without it; but, one way or
      other, there ought to be superiority on the man's side.</p>
     <p>'Well, who says there is not?'</p>
     <p>'My dear Norman! Why, this George Rivers is really below the average! you cannot deny that!
      Did you ever meet anyone so stupid?'</p>
     <p>'Really!' said Norman, considering; and, speaking very innocently, 'I cannot see why you
      think so. I do not see that he is at all less capable of sustaining a conversation than
      Richard.'</p>
     <p>Ethel sat down, perfectly breathless with amazement and indignation.</p>
     <pb n="393"/>
     <p>Norman saw that he had shocked her very much. 'I do not mean,' he said, 'that we have not
      much more to say to Richard; all I meant to say was, merely as to the intellect.'</p>
     <p>'I tell you,' said Ethel, 'it is not the intellect. Richard! why, you know how we respect,
      and look up to him. Dear old Ritchie! with his goodness, and earnestness, and right
      judgment—to compare him to that man! Norman! Norman! I never thought it of you!'</p>
     <p>'You do not understand me, Ethel. I only cited Richard, as a person who proves how little
      cleverness is needed to insure respect.'</p>
     <p>'And, I tell you, that cleverness is not the point.'</p>
     <p>'It is the only objection you have put forward.'</p>
     <p>'I did wrong,' said Ethel. 'It is not the real one. It is earnest goodness that one honours
      in Richard. Where do we find it in this man? who has never done anything but yawn over his
      self-in-dulgence.'</p>
     <p>'Now, Ethel, you are working yourself up into a state of foolish prejudice. You, and papa,
      have taken a dislike to him; and you are over-looking a great deal of good safe sense, and
      right thinking. I know his opinions are sound, and his motives right. He has been
      under-educated, we all see, and is not very brilliant or talkative; but, I respect Flora for
      perceiving his solid qualities.'</p>
     <p>'Very solid and weighty, indeed!' said Ethel, ironically. 'I wonder if she would have seen
      them in a poor Curate.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel! you are allowing yourself to be carried, by prejudice, a great deal too far. Are
      such imputations to be made, wherever there is inequality of means? It is very wrong! very
      unjust!'</p>
     <p>'So papa said,' replied Ethel, as she looked sorrowfully down. 'He was very angry with me
      for saying so. I wish I could help feeling as if that were the temptation.'</p>
     <p>'You ought,' said Norman. 'You will be sorry, if you set yourself, and him, against it.'</p>
     <p>'I only wish you to know what I feel; and, I think, Margaret and papa do,' said Ethel,
      humbly, 'and then you will not think us more unjust than we are. We cannot see anything so
      agreeable or suitable in this man, as to account for Flora's liking, and we do not feel
      convinced of his being good for much. That makes papa greatly averse to it, though he does not
      know any positive reason for refusing; and we cannot feel certain that she is doing quite
      right, or for her own happiness.'</p>
     <p>'You will be convinced,' said Norman, cheerfully. 'You will find out the good that is under
      the surface, when you have seen more of him. I have had a good deal of talk with him.'</p>
     <p>A good deal of talk <hi>to</hi> him would have been more correct, if Norman had but been
      aware of it. He had been at the chief expense
      <pb n="394"/> of the conversation with George Rivers, and had taken the sounds of assent,
      which he obtained, as evidences of his appreciation of all his views. Norman had been
      struggling so long against his old habit of looking down on Richard, and exalting intellect;
      and had seen, in his Oxford life, so many ill-effects of the knowledge that puffeth up, that
      he had come to have a certain respect for dullness, <hi>per se</hi> , of which George Rivers
      easily reaped the benefit, when surrounded by the halo, which everything at Abbotstoke Grange
      bore in the eyes of Norman.</p>
     <p>He was heartily delighted at the proposed connexion, and his genuine satisfaction not only
      gratified Flora, and restored the equanimity that had been slightly disturbed by her father,
      but it also reassured Ethel and Margaret, who could not help trusting in his judgment, and
      began to hope that George might be all he thought him.</p>
     <p>Ethel, finding that there were two ways of viewing the gentleman, doubted whether she ought
      to express her opinion. It was Flora's disposition, and the advantages of the match, that
      weighed most upon her, and, in spite of her surmise having been treated as so injurious, she
      could not rid herself of the burthen.</p>
     <p>Dr. May was not so much consoled by Norman's opinion, as Ethel expected. The corners of his
      mouth curled up a little with diversion, and though he tried to express himself glad, and
      confident in his son's judgment, there was the same sort of involuntary lurking misgiving,
      with which he had accepted Sir Matthew Fleet's view of Margaret's case.</p>
     <p>There was no danger that Dr. May would not be kind and courteous to the young man himself.
      It was not his fault if he were a dunce, and Dr. May perceived that his love for Flora was
      real, though clumsily expressed. He explained that he could not sanction the engagement till
      he should be better informed of the young gentleman's antecedents; this was, as George
      expressed it, a great nuisance, but his father agreed that it was quite right, in some doubt,
      perhaps, as to how Dr. May might be satisfied.</p>

     <p>Nothing transpired to the discredit of Lieutenant Rivers. He had spent a great deal
      of money, but chiefly for want of something else to do, and, though he was not a subject for
      high praise, there was no vice in him—no more than in an old donkey—as Dr. May declared, in
      his concluding paroxysm of despair, on finding that, though there was little to reconcile him
      to the engagement, there was no reasonable ground for thwarting his daughter's wishes. He
      argued the matter once more with her, and, finding her purpose fixed, he notified his consent,
      and the rest of the family were admitted to a knowledge of the secret which they had never
      suspected.</p>
     <p>Etheldred could not help being gratified with the indignation it excited. With one voice,
      Mary and Blanche declared that they would never give up the title of "the detestable," and
      would not make him any presents; certainly, not watch-chains! Miss Bracy, rather alarmed,
      lectured them just enough to make them worse; and Margaret, overhearing Blanche instructing
      Aubrey in her own impertinences, was obliged to call her to her sofa, and assure her that she
      was unkind to Flora, and that she must consider Mr. George Rivers as her brother.</p>
     <p>'Never my brother like Harry!' exclaimed Mary, indignantly.</p>
     <p>'No, indeed; nor like Alan!' exclaimed Blanche. 'And I won't call him George, I am
      determined, if it is ever so!'</p>
     <p>'It will not matter to him what such little girls call him,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>Blanche was so annihilated, that the sound of a carriage, and of the door bell, was a great
      satisfaction to her.</p>
     <p>Meta Rivers came flying into the room, her beautiful eyes dancing, and her cheeks glowing
      with pleasure, as, a little timidly, she kissed Margaret; while Ethel, in a confused way,
      received Mr. Rivers, in pain for her own cold, abrupt manner, in contrast with his gentle,
      congratulating politeness.</p>
     <pb n="396"/>
     <p>Meta asked, blushing, and with a hesitating voice, for their dear Flora; Mary offered to
      call her, but Meta begged to go herself, and thus was spared the awkwardness that ensued.
      Ethel was almost vexed with herself, as ungrateful, when she saw Mr. Rivers so mildly kind,
      and so delighted, with the bland courtesy that seemed fully conscious of the favour that Flora
      had conferred on his son, and thankful to the Mays for accepting him.</p>
     <p>Margaret answered with more expression of gratification, than would have been sincere in
      Ethel; but it was a relief, when Flora and Meta came in together, as pretty a contrast as
      could be seen; the little dark-eyed fairy, all radiant with joy, clinging to the slender waist
      of Flora, whose quiet grace, and maidenly dignity, were never more conspicuous, than, as with
      a soft red mantling in her fair cheek, her eyes cast down, but with a simple, unaffected
      warmth of confidence and gratitude, she came forward to receive Mr. Rivers's caressing
      affectionate greeting.</p>
     <p>Stiffness was over when she came in, and Dr. May, who presently made his appearance, soon
      was much more at his ease than could have been hoped, after his previous declarations that he
      should never be able to be moderately civil about it to Mr. Rivers. People of ready sympathy,
      such as Dr. May and Margaret, have a great deal of difficulty with their sincerity spared
      them, by being carried along with the feelings of others. Ethel could not feel the same, and
      was bent on avoiding any expression of opinion; she hoped that Meta's ecstacies would all be
      bestowed upon her future sister-in-law; but Meta was eager for an interview with Ethel
      herself, and, as usual, gained her point.</p>
     <p>'Now then, you are property of my own!' she cried. 'May I not take you all for sisters?'</p>
     <p>Ethel had not thought of this as a convenience of the connection, and she let Meta kiss her,
      and owned that it was very nice.</p>
     <p>'Ethel,' said Meta, 'I see, and I wanted to talk to you. You don't think poor George good
      enough for Flora.'</p>
     <p>'I never meant to shew it,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'You need not mind,' said Meta, smiling; 'I was very much surprised myself, and thought it
      all a mistake. But I am so very glad, for I know it will make such a difference to him, poor
      fellow. I should like to tell you all about him, for no one else can very well, and you will
      like him better, perhaps. You know my grandfather made his own fortune, and you would think
      some of our relations very queer. My aunt Dorothy once told me all about it— papa was made to
      marry the partner's daughter, and I fancy she could not have been much of a lady. I don't
      think he could have been very happy with her, but she soon died, and left him with this
      <pb n="397"/> one son, whom those odd old aunts brought up their own way. By-and-by, you know,
      papa came to be in quite another line of society, but when he married again, poor George had
      been so spoilt by these aunts, and was so big, and old, that my mother did not know what to
      make of him.'</p>
     <p>'A great lubberly boy,' Ethel said, rather repenting the next moment.</p>
     <p>'He is thirteen years older than I am,' said Meta, 'and you see it has been hard on him
      altogether; he had not the education that papa would have given him if he had been born later;
      and he can't remember his mother, and has always been at a loss when with clever people. I
      never understood it till within the last two or three years, nor knew how trying it must be to
      see such a little chit as me made so much of—almost thrusting him aside. But you cannot think
      what a warm-hearted good fellow he is—he has never been otherwise than so very kind to me, and
      he was so very fond of his old aunt. Hitherto, he has had such disadvantages, and no real,
      sensible woman, has taken him in hand; he does not care for papa's tastes, and I am so much
      younger, that I never could get on with him at all, till this time; but I do know that he has
      a real good-temper, and all sorts of good qualities, and that he only needs to be led right,
      to go right. Oh! Flora may make anything of him, and we are so thankful to her for having
      found it out!'</p>
     <p>'Thank you for telling me,' said Ethel. 'It is much more satisfactory to have no
      shamming.'</p>
     <p>Meta laughed, for Ethel's sham was not too successful; she continued, 'dear Dr. May, I
      thought he would think his beautiful Flora not exactly matched—but tell him, Ethel, for if he
      once is sorry for poor George, he will like him. And it will really be the making of George,
      to be thrown with him and your brothers. Oh! we are so glad! But I won't teaze you to be
      so.'</p>
     <p>'I can like it better now,' said Ethel. 'You know Norman thinks very highly of your brother,
      and declares that it will all come out by-and-by.'</p>
     <p>Meta clapped her hands, and said that she should tell her father, and Ethel parted with her,
      liking <hi>her</hi> , at least, better than ever. There was a comical scene between her and
      the Doctor, trying to define what relations they should become to each other, which Ethel
      thought did a good deal to mollify her father.</p>
     <p>The history of George's life did more; he took to pitying him, and pity was, indeed, akin to
      love in the good Doctor's mind. In fact, George was a man who could be liked, when once
      regarded as a belonging—a necessity, not a choice; for it was quite true that there was no
      harm in him, and a great deal of good-nature. His
      <pb n="398"/> constant kindness, and evident liking for Margaret, stood him in good stead; he
      made her a sort of confidante, bestowing on her his immeasurable appreciation of Flora's
      perfections, and telling her how well he was getting on with "the old gentleman"—a name under
      which she failed to recognize her father.</p>
     <p>As to Tom, he wrote his congratulations to Ethel, that she might make a wedding present of
      her Etruscan vases, the Cupids on which must have been put there by anticipation. Richard
      heard none of the doubts, and gave kind, warm congratulations, promising to return home for
      the wedding; and Mary and Blanche no sooner heard a whisper about bridesmaids, than all their
      opposition faded away, in a manner that quite scandalized Ethel, while it set Margaret on
      reminiscences of her having been a six-year old bridesmaid to Flora's godmother, Mrs.
      Arnott.</p>
     <p>As to the gossip in the town, Ethel quite dreaded the sight of everyone without Flora to
      protect her, and certainly, Flora's unaffected, quiet manner, was perfection, and kept off all
      too forward congratulations, while it gratified those whom she was willing to encourage.</p>
     <p>There was no reason for waiting, and Mr. Rivers was as impatient as his son, so an
      understanding arose that the wedding should take place near the end of the Christmas
      holidays.</p>
     <p>Flora shewed herself sensible and considerate. Always openhanded, her father was inclined to
      do everything liberally, and laid no restrictions on her preparations, but she had too much
      discretion to be profuse, and had a real regard for the welfare of the rest. She laughed with
      Ethel at the anticipations of the Stoneborough ladies that she must be going to London, and,
      at the requests, as a great favour, that they might be allowed the sight of her
       <hi>trousseau</hi> . Her wedding-dress, white silk, with a white cashmere mantle, was,
      indeed, ordered from Meta's London dress-maker; but, for the rest, she contented herself with
      an expedition to Whitford, accompanied by Miss Bracy and her two enchanted pupils, and there
      laid in a stock of purchases, unpretending and in good taste, aiming only at what could be
      well done, and not attempting the decorative wardrobe of a great lady. Ethel was highly amused
      when the Miss Andersons came for their inspection, to see their concealed disappointment at
      finding no under garments trimmed with Brussels, lace, nor pocket handkerchiefs all open-work,
      except a centre of the size of a crown-piece, and the only thing remarkable, was Margaret's
      beautiful marking in embroidery. There was some compensation in the costly wedding
      presents—Flora had reaped a whole harvest from friends of her own, grateful patients of her
      father, and the whole Rivers and Langdale connection; but, in spite of the brilliant
      uselessness of most of these, the young ladies considered themselves ill-used, thought Dr. May
      never would have
      <pb n="399"/> been shabby, and were of opinion that, when Miss Ward had married her father's
      surgical pupil, her outfit had been a far more edifying spectacle.</p>
     <p>The same moderation influenced Flora's other arrangements. Dr. May was resigned to whatever
      might be thought most proper, stipulating only that he should not have to make a speech; but
      Flora felt that, in their house, a grand breakfast would be an unsuccessful and melancholy
      affair. If the bride had been anyone else, she could have enjoyed making all go off well, but,
      under present circumstances, it would be great pain to her father and Margaret, a misery to
      Ethel, and something she dared not think of to the guests. She had no difficulty in having it
      dispensed with. George was glad to avoid "a great nuisance." Mr. Rivers feared the fatigue,
      and, with his daughter, admired Flora for her amiability, and, as to the home party, no words
      could express their gratitude to her for letting them off. Mary and Blanche did, indeed, look
      rather blank, but Blanche was consoled, by settling with Hector, the splendours in store for
      Alan and Margaret, and Mary cared the less, as there would be no Harry to enjoy the fun.</p>
     <p>The bride-maiden's glory was theirs by right, though Ethel was an unsatisfactory chief, for
      such as desired splendour. She protested against anything incongruous with January, or that
      could not be useful afterwards, and Meta took her part, laughing at the cruel stroke they were
      preparing for Bellairs. Ethel begged for dark silks and straw bonnets, and Flora said that she
      had expected to hear of brown stuff and grey duffle, but owned that they had better omit the
      ordinary muslin garb in the heart of winter. The baby bridesmaid was, at last, the chief
      consideration. Margaret suggested how pretty she and Blanche would look in sky-blue merino,
      trimmed with swan's-down. Meta was charmed with the idea, and though Ethel stuck out her
      shoulder-blades and poked out her head, and said she should look like the ugly duckling, she
      was clamorously reminded that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan, and promised that she
      should be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size, trimmed with white, for Mr. Rivers' good
      taste could endure, as little as Dr. May's sense of propriety, the sight of a daughter without
      shade to her face. Ethel, finally, gave in, on being put in mind that her papa had a
       <hi>penchant</hi> for swan's-down; and, on Margaret's promising to wear a dress of the same
      as theirs.</p>
     <p>Ethel was pleased and satisfied by Flora's dislike of parade, and attention to the feelings
      of all. Passing over the one great fact; the two sisters were more of one mind than usual,
      probably because all latent jealousy of Ethel had ceased in Flora's mind. Hitherto, she had
      preferred the being the only practically useful person in the
      <pb n="400"/> family, and had encouraged the idea of Ethel's <hi>gaucherie</hi> ; but now she
      desired to render her sister able to take her place, and did all in her power to put her in
      good heart.</p>
     <p>For Etheldred was terrified at the prospect of becoming responsible housekeeper. Margaret
      could only serve as an occasional reference. Her morning powers became too uncertain to be
      depended on for any regular, necessary duty, and it would have oppressed her so much to order
      the dinners, which she never saw, that, though she offered to resume the office, Flora would
      not hear of Ethel's consenting. If it were her proper business, Ethel supposed she could do
      it, but another hour of her leisure was gone, and what would become of them all, with her, a
      proverb for heedlessness, and ignorance of ordinary details. She did not know that these were
      more proverbial than actual, and, having a bad name, she believed in it herself. However,
      Flora made it her business to persuade her, that her powers were as good for household
      matters, as for books, or Cocksmoor; instructed her in her own methodical plans, and made her
      keep house for a fortnight, with so much success, that she began to be hopeful.</p>
     <p>In the attendance on Margaret, the other great charge, old nurse was the security; and
      Ethel, who had felt herself much less unhandy than before, was to succeed to the abode, in her
      room— Blanche being promoted, from the nursery, to the old attic. 'And,' said Flora,
      consolingly, 'if dear Margaret ever should be ill, you may reckon on me.'</p>
     <p>Miss Flora May made her last appearance at the Ladies' Committee, to hear the reply from the
      Principal of the College. It was a civil letter, but declined taking any steps in the matter,
      without more certain intelligence of the wishes of the Incumbent of the parish, or of the
      holders of the land in question.</p>
     <p>The Ladies abused all Colleges—as prejudiced old Bodies, and feared that it would be
      impossible to ask Mrs. Perkinson's niece to take the school, while there was neither room nor
      lodging. So Miss Rich recorded the correspondence, and the vote of censure, by which it was to
      be hoped the Ladies' Committee of Market Stoneborough, inflicted a severe blow on the
      Principal and Fellows of M— College.</p>
     <p>'Never mind, Ethel,' said Flora. 'I shall meet Sir Henry Walkinghame in London, and will
      talk to him. We shall yet astonish the Muses. If we can get the land without them, we shall be
      able to manage it our own way, without obligations.'</p>
     <p>'You forget the money!'</p>
     <p>'We will keep them from dissipating it—or that might be no harm! A hundred pounds will be
      easily found, and we should then
      <pb n="401"/> have it in our own hands. Besides, you know, I don't mean to give up. I shall
      write a polite note to Mrs. Ledwich, begging to subscribe on my own account, and to retain my
      seat! and you will see what we shall do.'</p>
     <p>'You mean to come down with the external authority,' said Ethel, smiling.</p>
     <p>'True! and though my driving in with a pair of horses may make little difference to you,
      Ethel, depend upon it, Mrs. Ledwich will be the more amenable. Whenever I want to be
      particularly impressive, I shall bring in that smelling-bottle, with the diamond stopper that
      won't come out, and you will find that carries all before it.</p>
     <p>'A talisman!' said Ethel laughing. 'But I had rather they yielded to a sense of right!'</p>
     <p>'So had I,' said Flora. 'Perhaps you will rule them that way?'</p>
     <p>'Not I!' cried Ethel, terrified.</p>
     <p>'Then you must come to me, and secondary motives. Seriously —I do mean that George should do
      something for Stoneborough; and, in a position of influence, I hope to be able to be useful to
      my poor old town. Perhaps we shall have the Minster restored.'</p>
     <p>Flora did wish it. She did love Stoneborough, and was sincerely interested for Cocksmoor.
      She thought she worked earnestly for them, and that her situation would be turned to their
      profit; but there was something, for which she worked more earnestly. Had Flora never heard of
      the two masters, whom we cannot serve at the same time?</p>
     <p>Richard came home for 'a Parson's week,' so as to include the wedding. He looked very fresh
      and youthful; but his manner, though still gentle and retiring, had lost all that shrinking
      diffidence, and had, now, a very suitable grave composure. Everybody was delighted to have
      him; and Ethel, more than anyone, except Margaret. What floods of Cocksmoor histories were
      poured upon him; and what comparing of notes about his present school children! He could not
      enter into the refinements of her dread of the Ladies' Committee, and thought she might be
      thankful if the school were built by any proper means; for, if Cherry Elwood were retained,
      and the ladies prevented from doing harm, he did not understand why Ethel should wish to
      reject all assistance, that did not come in a manner she admired. He never would comprehend—
      so Ethel gave it up—feared she was again jealous and self-sufficient, and contented herself
      with the joy that his presence produced at Cocksmoor, where the children smiled, blushed, and
      tittered, with ecstacy, whenever he even looked at one of them.</p>
     <p>Richard was not allowed to have a Sunday of rest. His father apologized for having made an
      engagement for him—as
      <pb n="402"/> Mr. Ramsden was unwell, and the school Clergy were all absent, so that he could
      do no otherwise than assist in the service. Richard coloured, and said that he had brought no
      sermon; and he was, in fact, deprived of much of his sisters' company, for composition was not
      easy to him, and the quantity of time he spent on it, quite alarmed Norman and Ethel, who both
      felt rather nervous on the Sunday morning, but agreed that preaching was not everything.</p>
     <p>Ethel could not see well, as far as the reading desk, but she saw her father glance up, take
      off his spectacles, wipe them, and put them away; and she could not be displeased, though she
      looked reproof at Blanche's breathless whisper, 'Oh, he looks so nice!' Those white folds did
      truly suit well, with the meek, serious expression of the young Deacon's fair face, and made
      him, as his sisters afterwards said, like one of the solemnly peaceful angel-carvings of the
      earlier ages.</p>
     <p>His voice was sweet and clear, and his reading full of quiet simplicity and devotion, such
      as was not often heard by that congregation, who were too much used, either to carelessness,
      or to pomposity. The sermon made his brother and sister ashamed of their fears. It was an
      exposition of the Gospel for the day, practical and earnest, going deep, and rising high, with
      a clearness and soberness, yet with a beauty and elevation, such as Norman and Ethel had
      certainly not expected—or, rather, they forgot all their own expectations, and Richard
      himself, and only recollected their own hearts, and the great future before them.</p>
     <p>Even Blanche and Aubrey told Margaret a great deal about it, and declared that, if Richard
      preached every Sunday, they should like going to Church much better.</p>
     <p>When Dr. May came in, some time after, he was looking much pleased. 'So, Mr. Ritchie,' he
      said, 'you have made quite a sensation —everyone shaking me by the hand, and thanking me for
      my son's sermon. You will be a popular preacher at last!'</p>
     <p>Richard blushed distressfully, and quoted the saying, that it would be the true comfort to
      hear that people went home, thinking of themselves, rather than of the sermon. This put an end
      to the subject; but the Doctor went over it again, most thoroughly, with his other children,
      who were greatly delighted.</p>
     <p>Flora's last home Sunday! She was pale and serious, evidently feeling much, though seeking
      no <hi>tête à têtes</hi> , and chiefly engrossed with waiting on Margaret, or fondling little
      Gertrude. No one saw the inside of her mind—probably, she did not herself. On the outside was
      a very suitable pensiveness, and affection for all that she was leaving. The only one in the
      family, to whom she talked much, was Norman, who continued to see many perfections in
      <pb n="403"/> George, and contrived, by the force of his belief, to impress the same on the
      others; and to make them think his great talent for silence, such a proof of his discretion,
      that they were not staggered, even by his shy blundering exclamation, that his wedding would
      be a great nuisance—a phrase which, as Dr. May observed, was, to him, what <hi>Est il
       possible</hi> was to his namesake of Denmark.</p>
     <p>Nobody wished for any misgivings, so Richard was never told of any, though there was a
      careful watch kept, to see what were his first impressions. None transpired, except something
      about good nature, but it was shrewdly believed that Richard and George, being much alike in
      shy unwillingness to speak, had been highly satisfied with the little trouble they had caused
      to each other, and so had come to a <hi>tacit</hi> esteem.</p>
     <p>There was very little bustle of preparation. Excepting the packing, everything went on much
      as usual, till the Thursday morning, and then the children were up early, refreshing the
      Christmas hollies, and working up their excitement, only to have it damped by the suppressed
      agitation of their elders at the breakfast-table.</p>
     <p>Dr. May did not seem to know what he was about; and Flora looked paler and paler. She went
      away before the meal was over, and, when Ethel went to the bed-room, shortly after, she found
      that she had fairly broken down, and was kneeling beside Margaret's sofa, resting her head on
      her sister's bosom, and sobbing—as Ethel had never seen her weep, except on that dreadful
      night, after their mother's death.</p>
     <p>In a person ordinarily of such self-command as Flora, weeping was a terrible thing, and
      Margaret was much distressed and alarmed; but the worst had passed before Ethel came up, and
      Flora was able to speak. 'Oh! Margaret! I cannot leave you! Oh! how happy we have been—'</p>
     <p>'You are going to be happier, we trust, dearest,' said Margaret, fondly.</p>
     <p>'Oh! what have I done? It is not worth it!'</p>
     <p>Ethel thought she caught those words; but, no more, Mary's step was heard, and Flora was on
      her feet, instantly, composing herself rapidly. She shed no more tears, but her eyelids were
      very heavy, and her face softened, in a manner that, though she was less pretty than usual,
      was very becoming under her bridal veil. She recovered calmness, and even cheerfulness, while
      reversing the usual order of things, and dressing her bridemaids, who would never have turned
      out fit to be seen, but for the exertions of herself, Margaret, and Miss Bracy. Ethel's long
      Scotch bones, and Mary's round, dumpy shapelessness, were, in their different ways, equally
      hard to overcome; and the one was swelled out with a fabulous number of
      <pb n="404"/> petticoats, and the other pinched in, till she gasped and screamed for mercy,
      while Blanche and Gertrude danced about, beautiful to behold, under their shady hats; and
      presently, with a light tap at the door, Meta Rivers stepped in, looking so pretty, that all
      felt, that to try to attain to such an appearance, was vain.</p>
     <p>Timid in her affection, she hardly dared to do more than kiss them, and whisper her pretty
      caressing words to each. There was no more time—Dr. Hoxton's carriage was come to take up the
      bride.</p>
     <p>Ethel did as she was told, without much volition of her own; and she quitted the carriage,
      and was drawn into her place by Norman, trusting that Meta would not let her do wrong, and
      relieved that, just in front of her, were the little ones, over whose heads she could see her
      father, with Flora's veiled bending figure.</p>
     <p>That pause, while the procession was getting into order, the slow movement up the centre
      aisle, the week-day atmosphere of the Church, brought back to her thoughts a very different
      time, and one of those strange echoings on the mind, repeated in her ears the words, 'For man
      walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain—'</p>
     <p>There was a little pause—George did not seem to be forthcoming, and Meta turned round,
      rather uneasily, and whispered something about his having been so nervous. However, there he
      was, looking exceedingly red, and very sheepish, and disposed to fall back on his best-man,
      Norman, whose countenance was at the brightest—and almost handsome.</p>
     <p>Dr. Hoxton performed the ceremony, "assisted by" Richard. It had been Flora's choice; and
      his loud sonorous voice was thought very impressive. Blanche stood the nearest, and looked
      happy, and important, with Flora's glove. Gertrude held Mary's hand, and gazed straight up
      into the fretted roof, as if that were to her the chief marvel. Ethel stood and knelt, but did
      not seem, to herself, to have the power of thinking, or feeling. She saw and heard—that was
      all; she could not realize.</p>
     <p>They drew her forward, when it was over, to sign her name, as witness. She took up the pen,
      looked at the Flora May, written for the last time, and found her hand so trembling, that she
      said, half-smiling, that she could not write. Mary was only too well pleased to supply the
      deficiency. Dr. May looked at her anxiously, and asked whether she felt overcome.</p>
     <p>'No, papa. I did not know my hand was shaky.'</p>
     <p>He took it into his, and pressed it. Ethel knew, then, how much had been undeveloped in her
      own mind, catching it, as it were, from his touch, and look. The thought of his past joy—the
      sad fading of hope for Margaret—the fear and doubt for their present bride—
      <pb n="405"/> above all, the sense that the fashion of this world passeth away; and that it is
      not the outward scene, but our bearing in it, that is to last for ever.</p>
     <p>The bells struck up, each peal ending with a crash, that gave Ethel some vague idea of
      fatality; and they all came back to the house, where Margaret was ready, in the drawing-room,
      to receive them, looking very pretty, in her soft blue dress, which especially became her fair
      complexion, and light brown hair. Ethel did not quite like the pink colour on her cheeks, and
      feared that she had been shaken by Flora's agitation, in the morning; but she was very calm
      and bright, in the affectionate greeting with which she held out her hands to the bride and
      bridegroom, as they came in.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rivers and Meta were the only guests, and, while Meta was seized by the children,
      Margaret lay talking to Mr. Rivers, George standing upright and silent behind her sofa, like a
      sentinel. Flora was gone to change her dress, not giving way, but nervous and hurried, as she
      reiterated parting directions about household comforts to Ethel, who stood by the
      toilette-table, sticking a pin into the pincushion and drawing it out again, as if solely
      intent on making it always fit into the same hole, while Mary dressed Flora, packed, flew
      about, and was useful.</p>
     <p>As they came down stairs, Ethel found that Flora was trembling from head to foot, and
      leaning on her; Dr. May stood at the foot of the stairs, and folded his daughter in a long
      embrace; Flora gave herself up to it as if she would never bear to leave it. Did a flash come
      over her then, what the father was, whom she had held cheaply? what was the worth of that for
      which she had exchanged such a home? She spoke not a word, she only clung tightly—if her heart
      failed her—it was too late "Bless you! my child!" he said at last. "Only be what your mother
      was!"</p>
     <p>A coming tread warned them to part. There was a tray of luncheon for the two who were about
      to depart, and the great snow-white cake was waiting for Flora to cut it. She smiled,
      accomplished that feat steadily, and Norman continuing the operation, Aubrey guided Gertrude
      in handing round the slices. George did full justice thereto, as well as to the more solid
      viands. Flora could taste nothing, but she contrived to smile and say it was too early. She
      was in haste to have it over now, and, as soon as George had finished, she rose up, still
      composed and resolved, the last kisses were given—Gertrude was lifted up to her, after she was
      in the carriage for the very last, when George proposed to run away with her also, whereupon
      Daisy kicked and screamed, and was taken back in haste. The door was shut, and they drove off,
      bound for the Continent, and then Mary, as if the contingency of losing Flora had only for the
      first time occurred
      <pb n="406"/> to her as the consequence of the wedding, broke out into a piteous fit of
      sobbing—rather too unrestrained, considering her fourteen years.</p>
     <p>Poor Mary, she was a very child still! They pulled her into the study, out of the way of Mr.
      Rivers, and Meta had no sooner said how Flora would soon come home and live at the Grange, and
      talked of the grand school-feast, to which she was at once going to take her friends, than the
      round rosy face drew out of its melancholy puckers into smiles, as Mary began to tell the
      delight caused by the invitations which she had conveyed. That was to be a feast indeed —all
      the Abbotstoke children—all Flora's class at Stoneborough, and as many Cocksmoor scholars as
      could walk so far, were to dine on Christmas fare, at one o'clock, at the Grange, and Meta was
      in haste to be at home to superintend the feast.</p>
     <p>Mary, Blanche, and Aubrey went with her, under the keeping of Miss Bracy, the boys were to
      follow. She had hoped for Ethel, but on looking at her, ceased her coaxing importunity.</p>
     <p>'I see,' she said, kindly; 'even school children will not be so good for you as peace.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Ethel, 'I should like to be quiet till the evening, if you will let me
      off. It is very kind in you.'</p>
     <p>'I ought to know how to pity you,' said Meta, 'I who have gained what you have lost.'</p>
     <p>'I want to think too,' said Ethel. 'It is the beginning to me of a new life, and I have not
      been able to look at it yet.'</p>
     <p>'Besides, Margaret will want you. Poor Margaret—has it been very trying to her?'</p>
     <p>'I fear so, but I shall keep out of her way, and leave her to a quiet afternoon with
      Richard. It will be the greatest treat to those two to be together.'</p>
     <p>'Very well, I will carry off the children, and leave the house quiet.'</p>
     <p>And quiet it was in another hour—Gertrude walking with the nurses, Dr. May gone to his
      patients, and all the rest at Abbotstoke, except Richard and Margaret down-stairs; and Ethel,
      who, while arranging her properties in her new room, had full leisure to lay out before
      herself the duties that had devolved on her, and to grapple with them. She recalled the many
      counsels that she had received from Flora, and they sounded so bewildering, that she wished it
      had been Conic sections, and then she looked at a Hebrew grammar that Norman had given her,
      and gave a sigh as she slipped it into the shelf of the seldom used. She looked about the
      room, cleared out the last piece of brown paper, and burnt the last torn envelope, that no
      relic of packing and change might distress Margaret's eyes for order—then feeling at once
      desolate and intrusive, she sat down in Flora's fire-side chair, opened her desk, and took
      <pb n="407"/> out her last time-table. She looked at it for some minutes, laid it aside, and
      rising, knelt down. Again seating herself, she resumed her paper, took a blank one, ruled it,
      and wrote her rules for each hour of each day in the week. That first hour after breakfast,
      when hitherto she had been free, was one sacrifice—it must go now, to ordering dinner, seeing
      after stores, watching over the children's clothes, and the other non-descripts, which,
      happily for her, Flora had already reduced to method. The other loss was the spare time
      between the walk and tea; she must not spend that in her own room now, or there would be no
      one to sit with Margaret, or keep the little ones from being troublesome to her. Ethel had
      often had to give up this space before, when Flora went out in the evening, and she had seldom
      felt otherwise than annoyed. Give it up for good! that was the cure for temper, but it had
      been valuable as something of her own! She would have been thankful could she have hoped to
      keep regularly to her own rules, but that she knew was utterly improbable—boys, holidays,
      callers, engagements, Dr. May, would all conspire to turn half her days upside down, and
      Cocksmoor itself must often depend not only on the weather, but on home doings. Two or three
      notes she wrote at the foot of her paper.</p>
     <p>N. B. These are a standard—not a bed of Procrustes.</p>
     <p><hi>Musts</hi> —To be first consulted.— <hi>Mays</hi> —last. Ethel May's last of all.</p>
     <p>If I cannot do everything—omit the self-chosen.</p>
     <p><hi>Mem.</hi> —Neither hurry when it depends on myself, nor fidget when it depends on
      others.</p>
     <p>Keep a book going, to pacify myself.</p>
     <p>Her rules drawn up, Ethel knelt once more. Then she drew a long sigh, and wondered where
      Flora was; and next, as she was fairly fagged, mind and body, she threw herself back in the
      armchair, took up a railway novel that Hector had brought home, and which they had hidden from
      the children, and repaired herself with the luxury of an idle reading.</p>
     <p>Margaret and Richard likewise spent a peaceful, though pensive afternoon. Margaret had
      portions of letters from Alan to read to him, and a consultation to hold. The hope of her full
      recovery had so melted away, that she had, in every letter, striven to prepare Mr. Ernescliffe
      for the disappointment, and each that she received in return was so sanguine and affectionate,
      that the very fondness was as much grief as joy. She could not believe that he took in the
      true state of the case, or was prepared to perceive that she could never be his wife, and she
      wanted Richard to write one of his clear, dispassionate statements, such as carried full
      conviction, and to help to put a final end to the engagement.</p>
     <p>'But why,' said Richard—'why should you wish to distress him?'</p>
     <pb n="408"/>
     <p>'Because I cannot bear that he should be deceived, and should feed on false hopes. 'Do you
      think it right, Richard?'</p>
     <p>'I will write to him, if you like,' said Richard; 'but I think he must pretty well know the
      truth from all the letters to Harry and to himself.'</p>
     <p>'It would be so much better for him, to settle his mind at once,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Perhaps he would not think so—'</p>
     <p>There was a pause, while Margaret saw that her brother was thinking. At last, he said,
      'Margaret, will you pardon me? I do think that this is a little restlessness. The truth has
      not been kept from him, and I do not see that we are called to force it on him. He is sensible
      and reasonable, and will know how to judge when he comes home.'</p>
     <p>'It was to try to save him the pang,' murmured Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Yes; but it will be worse far away than near. I do not mean that we should conceal the
      fact, but you have no right to give him up before he comes home. The whole engagement was for
      the time of his voyage.'</p>
     <p>'Then you think I ought not to break it off before his return?'</p>
     <p>'Certainly not.'</p>
     <p>'It will be pain spared—unless it should be worse by-and-by.'</p>
     <p>'I do not suppose we ought to look to by-and-by,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'How so.'</p>
     <p>'Do the clearly right thing, for the present, I mean,' he said, 'without anxiety for the
      rest. How do we—any of us—know what may be the case in another year?'</p>
     <p>'Do not flatter me with hopes,' said Margaret, sadly smiling; 'I have had too many of
      them.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Richard; 'I do not think you will ever get well. But so much may happen—'</p>
     <p>'I had rather have my mind made up once for all, and resign myself,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'His will is sometimes that we should be uncertain,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'And that is the most trying,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Just so—' and he paused tenderly.</p>
     <p>'I feel how much has been right,' said Margaret. 'This wedding has brought my real character
      before me. I feel what I should have been. You have no notion how excited and elated I can get
      about a little bit of dress out of the common way for myself, or others,' said she,
      smiling—'and then all the external show and things belonging to station—I naturally care much
      more for them than even Flora does. Ethel would bear all those things as if they did not
      exist—I could not.'</p>
     <pb n="409"/>
     <p>'They would be a temptation?'</p>
     <p>'They would once have been. Yes, they would now,' said Margaret. 'And government, and
      management, and influence—you would not guess what dreams I used to waste on them, and now
      here am I set aside from it all, good for nothing but for all you dear ones to be kind
      to.'</p>
     <p>'They would not say so,' said Richard, kindly.</p>
     <p>'Not say it, but I feel it. Papa and Ethel are all the world to each other—Richard, I may
      say it to you—There has been only one thing more hard to bear than that—Don't suppose there
      was a moment's neglect, or disregard; but when first I understood that Ethel could be more to
      him than I—then I could not always feel rightly. It was the punishment for always wanting to
      be first.'</p>
     <p>'My father would be grieved that you had the notion. You should not keep it.'</p>
     <p>'He does not know it is so,' said Margaret; 'I am his first care, I fear, his second grief;
      but it is not in the nature of things that Ethel should not be more his comfort and companion.
      Oh! I am glad it was not she who married! What shall we do when she goes?'</p>
     <p>This came from Margaret's heart, so as to shew that, if there had once been a jealous pang
      of mortification, it had been healed by overflowing, unselfish affection, and humility.</p>
     <p>They went off to praise Ethel, and thence to praise Norman, and the elder brother and
      sister, who might have had some jealousy of the superiority of their juniors, spent a good
      happy hour in dwelling on the shining qualities they loved so heartily.</p>
     <p>And Richard was drawn into talking of his own deeper thoughts, and Margaret had again the
      comfort of clerical counsel—and now from her own most dear brother! So they sat till darkness
      closed in, when Ethel came down, bringing Gertrude and her great favour, very full of chatter,
      only not quite sure whether she had been bride, bridemaid, or bridegroom.</p>
     <p>The school-room set, with Tom and Aubrey, came home soon after, and tongues went fast with
      stories of roast-beef, plum-pudding, and blind man's-buff. How the dear Meta had sent a cart
      to Cocksmoor to bring Cherry herself, and how many slices everybody had eaten, and how the
      bride's health had been drunk by the children in real wine, and how they had all played,
      Norman and all, and how Hector had made Blanche bold enough to extract a raisin from the
      flaming snap-dragon.—It was not half told when Dr. May came home, and Ethel went up to dress
      for her dinner at Abbotstoke, Mary following to help her, and continue her narration, which
      bade fair to entertain Margaret the whole evening.</p>
     <p>Dr. May, Richard, and Ethel, had a comfortable dark drive to
      <pb n="410"/> the Grange, and, on arriving, found Hector deep in "Wild Sports of the West,"
      while Norman and Meta were sitting over the fire talking, and Mr. Rivers was resting in his
      library.</p>
     <p>And when Ethel and Meta spent the time before the gentlemen came in from the dining-room, in
      a happy <hi>tête à tête</hi> , Ethel learnt that the fire-light dialogue had been the
      pleasantest part of the whole day, and that Meta had had confided to her the existence of
      Decius Mus—a secret which Ethel had hitherto considered as her own peculiar property, but she
      supposed it was a pledge of the sisterhood, which Meta professed with all the house of
      May.</p>

     <p>Etheldred was thankful for that confidence to Meta Rivers, for without it, she
      would hardly have succeeded in spurring Norman up to give the finishing touches to Decius, and
      to send him in. If she talked of the poem as the devotion of Decius, he was willing enough,
      and worked with spirit, for he liked the ideas, and enjoyed the expressing them, and trying to
      bring his lines to his notion of perfection, but if she called it the "Newdigate," or the
      "Prize Poem," and declared herself sure it would be successful, he yawned, slackened, leant
      back in his chair, and began to read other people's poetry, which Ethel was disrespectful
      enough not to think nearly as good as his own.</p>
     <p>It was completed at last, and Ethel stitched it up with a narrow red and white ribbon—the
      Balliol colours; and set Meta at him till a promise was extorted that he would send it in.</p>
     <p>And, in due time, Ethel received the following note:</p>
     <p>My dear Ethel,—</p>
     <p>My peacock bubble has flown over the house. Tell them all about it.          Your
      affectionate, N. W. M.</p>
     <p>They were too much accustomed to Norman's successes to be extraordinarily excited; Ethel
      would have been much mortified if
      <pb n="411"/> the prize had been awarded to anyone else, but, as it was, it came rather as a
      matter of course. The Doctor was greatly pleased, and said he should drive round by Abbotstoke
      to tell the news there, and then laughed beyond measure to hear that Meta had been in the
      plot, saying, he should accuse the little humming-bird of being a magpie, stealing
      secrets.</p>
     <p>By this time, the bride and bridegroom were writing that they thought of soon returning—they
      had spent the early spring at Paris, had wandered about in the south of France, and now were
      at Paris again. Flora's letters were long, descriptive, and affectionate, and she was eager to
      be kept fully informed of everything at home. As soon as she heard of Norman's success, she
      wrote a whole budget of letters, declaring that she and George would hear of no refusal; they
      were going to spend a fortnight at Oxford for the Commemoration, and must have Meta and Ethel
      with them to hear Norman's poem in the theatre.</p>
     <p>Dr. May, who already had expressed a hankering to run up for the day, and take Ethel with
      him, was perfectly delighted at the proposal, and so was Mr. Rivers, but the young ladies made
      many demurs. Ethel wanted Mary to go in her stead, and had to be told that this would not be
      by any means the same to the other parties—she could not bear to leave Margaret; it was a long
      time since there had been letters from the Alcestis, and she did not like to miss being at
      home when they should come; and Meta, on her side, was so unwilling to leave her father, that,
      at last, Dr. May scolded them both for a pair of conceited, self-important damsels, who
      thought nothing could go on without them; and next, compared them to young birds, obliged to
      be shoved by force into flying.</p>
     <p>Meta consented first, on condition that Ethel would; and Ethel found that her whole house
      would be greatly disappointed if she refused, so she proceeded to be grateful, and then
      discovered how extremely delightful the plan was. Oxford, of which she had heard so much, and
      which she had always wished to see! And Norman's glory—and Meta's company—nay, the very
      holiday, and going from home, were charms enough for a girl of eighteen, who had never been
      beyond Whitford in her life. Besides, to crown all, papa promised that, if his patients would
      behave well, and not want him too much, he would come up for the one great day.</p>
     <p>Mr. and Mrs. George Rivers came to Abbotstoke to collect their party. They arrived by a
      railroad, whose station was nearer to Abbotstoke than to Stoneborough, therefore, instead of
      their visiting the High-street by the way, Dr. May, with Ethel, and Mary, were
      <pb n="412"/> invited to dine at the Grange, the first evening—a proposal, at least, as new
      and exciting to Mary, as was the journey to Oxford, to her sister.</p>
     <p>The two girls went early, as the travellers had intended to arrive before luncheon, and,
      though Ethel said few words, but let Mary rattle on with a stream of conjectures and
      questions, her heart was full of longings for her sister, as well as of strange doubts and
      fears, as to the change that her new life might have made in her.</p>
     <p>'There! there!' cried Mary. 'Yes! it is Flora! Only she has her hair done in a funny
      way!'</p>
     <p>Flora and Meta were both standing on the steps before the conservatory, and Mary made but
      one bound before she was hugging Flora. Ethel kissed her without so much violence, and then
      saw that Flora was looking very well and bright, more decidedly pretty and elegant than ever,
      and with certainly no diminution of affection; it was warmer, though rather more
      patronizing.</p>
     <p>'How natural you look!' was her first exclamation, as she held Mary's hand, and drew Ethel's
      arm into hers. 'And how is Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'Pretty well—but the heat makes her languid—'</p>
     <p>'Is there any letter yet?'</p>
     <p>'No—'</p>
     <p>'I do not see any cause for alarm—letters are so often detained, but, of course, she will be
      anxious.—Has she had pain in the back again.'</p>
     <p>'Sometimes, but summer always does her good—'</p>
     <p>'I shall see her to-morrow—and the Daisy—How do you all get on? Have you broken down yet,
      Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! we do go on,' said Ethel, smiling; the worst thing I have done was expecting James to
      dress the salads with lamp-oil.'</p>
     <p>'A Greenland salad! But don't talk of oil—I have the taste still in my mouth after the
      Pyrennean cookery! Oh! Ethel, you would have been wild with delight in those places!'</p>
     <p>'Snowy mountains! Are they not like a fairy-dream to you now? You must have felt at home, as
      a Scotchwoman's daughter.'</p>
     <p>'Think of the peaks in the sun-rise! Oh! I wanted you in the pass of Roncevalles, to hear
      the echo of Roland's horn. And we saw the cleft made by Roland's sword in the rocks.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! how delightful—and Spain too!'</p>
     <p>'Aye, the Isle of Pheasants, where all the conferences took place.'</p>
     <p>'Where Louis XIV. met his bride, and François I. sealed his treason with his empty
      flourish—'</p>
     <p>'Well, don't let us fight about François I. now; I want to know how Tom likes Eton.'</p>
     <pb n="413"/>
     <p>'He gets on famously. I am so glad he is in the same house with Hector.'</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ramsden—how is he?'</p>
     <p>'No better—he has not done any duty for weeks. Tomkins and his set want to sell the next
      presentation, but papa hopes to stave that off, for there is a better set than usual in the
      Town Council this year.'</p>
     <p>'Cocksmoor? And how are our friends the Muses? I found a note from the secretary telling me
      that I am elected again. How have they behaved?'</p>
     <p>'Pretty well,' said Ethel. 'Mrs. Ledwich has been away, so we have had few meetings, and
      have been pretty quiet, except for an uproar about the mistress beating that Franklin's
      girl—and what do you think I did, Flora? I made bold to say the woman should shew her to papa,
      to see if she had done her any harm, and he found that it was all a fabrication from one end
      to the other. So it ended in the poor girl being expelled, and Mary and I have her twice a
      week, to see if there is any grace in her.'</p>
     <p>'To reward her!' said Flora. 'That is always your way—'</p>
     <p>'Why, one cannot give the poor thing quite up,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'You will manage the ladies at last!' cried Flora.</p>
     <p>'Not while Mrs. Ledwich is there!'</p>
     <p>'I'll cope with her! But, come, I want you in my room—'</p>
     <p>'May not I come? said Meta. 'I must see when—'</p>
     <p>Flora held up her hand, and, while signing invitation, gave an arch look to Meta to be
      silent. Ethel here bethought herself of enquiring after Mr. Rivers, and then for George.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rivers was pretty well—George, quite well, and somewhere in the garden; and Meta said
      that he had such a beard that they would hardly know him; while, Flora added, that he was
      delighted with the Oxford scheme.</p>
     <p>Flora's rooms had been, already, often shewn to her sisters, when Mr. Rivers had been newly
      furnishing them, with every luxury and ornament that taste could devise. Her dressing room,
      with the large bay window, commanding a beautiful view of Stoneborough, and filled, but not
      crowded, with every sort of choice article, was a perfect exhibition to eyes unaccustomed to
      such varieties.</p>
     <p>Mary could have been still amused by the hour, in studying the devices and ornaments on the
      shelves and chiffonieres; and Blanche had romanced about it, to the little ones, till they
      were erecting it into a mythical palace.</p>
     <p>And Flora, in her simple, well-chosen dress, looked, and moved, as if she had been born and
      bred in the like.</p>
     <p>There were signs of unpacking about the room—Flora's dressing-case
      <pb n="414"/> on the table, and some dresses lying on the sofa and ottoman.</p>
     <p>Mary ran up to them eagerly, and exclaimed at the beautiful shot blue and white silk.</p>
     <p>'Paris fashions?' said Ethel, carelessly.</p>
     <p>'Yes; but I don't parade my own dresses here,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Whose are they then? Your commissions, Meta?'</p>
     <p>'No!' and Meta laughed heartily.</p>
     <p>'Your French maid's then?' said Ethel. I dare say she dresses quite as well; and the things
      are too really pretty and simple for an English maid's taste.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad you like them,' said Flora, maliciously. 'Now, please to be good.'</p>
     <p>'Who are they for then?' said Ethel, beginning to be frightened.</p>
     <p>'For a young lady, whose brother has got the Newdigate prize, and who is going to
      Oxford.'</p>
     <p>'Me! Those! But I have not got four backs,' as Ethel saw Meta in fits of laughing, and Flora
      making affirmative signs. Mary gave a ponderous spring of ecstacy.</p>
     <p>'Come!' said Flora, 'you may as well be quiet. Whatever you may like, I am not going to have
      the Newdigate prizeman shown as brother to a scare-crow. I knew what you would come to,
      without me to take care of you. Look at yourself in the glass.'</p>
     <p>'I'm sure I see no harm in myself,' said Ethel, turning towards the pier-glass, and
      surveying herself—in a white muslin, made high, a black silk mantle, and a brown hat. She had
      felt very respectable when she set out, but she could not avoid a lurking conviction that,
      beside Flora and Meta, it had a scanty, school-girl effect. 'And,' she continued, quaintly,
      'besides, I have <hi>really</hi> got a new gown on purpose—a good useful silk, that papa chose
      at Whitford —just the colour of a copper tea-kettle, where it turns purple.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel! you will kill me!' said Meta, sinking back on the sofa.</p>
     <p>'And, I suppose,' continued Flora, 'that you have sent it to Miss Broad's, without any
      directions, and she will trim it with flame-coloured gimp, and glass buttons; and, unless
      Margaret catches you, you will find yourself ready to set the Thames on fire. No, my dear
      tea-kettle, I take you to Oxford on my own terms, and you had better submit, without a fuss,
      and be thankful it is no worse. George wanted me to buy you a white brocade, with a perfect
      flower-garden on it, that you could have examined with a microscope. I was obliged to let him
      buy that lace mantle, to make up to him. Now then, Meta, the scene opens, and discovers—'</p>
     <p>Meta opened the folding-doors into Flora's bed-room, and thence came forward Bellairs and a
      little brisk Frenchwoman, whom Flora
      <pb n="415"/> had acquired at Paris. The former, who was quite used to adorning Miss Ethel
      against her will, looked as amused as her mistresses; and, before Ethel knew what was going
      on, her muslin was stripped off her back, and that instrument of torture, a half made body,
      was being tried upon her. She made one of her most wonderful grimaces of despair, and stood
      still! The dresses were not so bad after all; they were more tasteful than costly, and neither
      in material nor ornament, were otherwise than suitable to the occasion, and the wearer. It was
      very kind and thoughtful of Flora—that she could not but feel—nothing had been forgotten, but
      when Ethel saw the mantles, the ribbons, the collars, the bonnet, all glistening with the
      French air of freshness and grace, she began to feel doubts and hesitations, whether she ought
      to let her sister go to such an expense on her account, and privately resolved that the
      accepting thanks should not be spoken, till she should have consulted her father.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, she could only endure, be laughed at by her elders, and entertained by
      Mary's extreme pleasure in her array. Good Mary—it was more than any comedy to her; she had
      not one moment's thought of herself, till, when Flora dived into her box, produced a pair of
      bracelets, and fastened them on her comfortable plump arms, her eyes grew wide with wonder,
      and she felt, at least, two stages nearer womanhood.</p>
     <p>Flora had omitted no one. There was a Paris present for every servant at home, and a
      needle-case even for Cherry Elwood, for which Ethel thanked her with a fervency wanting in her
      own case.</p>
     <p>She accomplished consulting her father on her scruples, and he set her mind at rest. He knew
      that the outlay was a mere trifle to the Riverses, and was greatly pleased and touched with
      the affection that Flora showed; so he only smiled at Ethel's doubts, and dwelt with heartfelt
      delight on the beautiful print, that she had brought him from Ary Scheffer's picture of the
      Great Consoler.</p>
     <p>Flora was in her glory. To be able to bestow benefits on those whom she loved, had been
      always a favourite vision, and she had the full pleasure of feeling how much enjoyment she was
      causing. They had a very pleasant evening; she gave interesting accounts of their tour, and by
      her appeals to her husband, made him talk also. He was much more animated and agreeable than
      Ethel had ever seen him, and was actually laughing, and making Mary laugh heartily with his
      histories of the inns in the Pyrennees. Old Mr. Rivers looked as proud and happy as possible,
      and was quite young and gay, having evidently forgotten all his maladies, in paying elaborate
      attention to his daughter-in-law.</p>
     <p>Ethel told Margaret, that night, that she was quite satisfied about
      <pb n="416"/> Flora—she was glad to own that she had done her injustice, and that Norman was
      right in saying there was more in George Rivers than met the eye.</p>
     <p>The morning spent at home was equally charming. Flora came back, with love strengthened by
      absence. She was devoted to Margaret—caressing to all; she sat in her old places; she
      fulfilled her former offices; she gratified Miss Bracy, by visiting her in the school-room,
      and talking of French books; and won golden opinions, by taking Gertrude in her hand, and
      walking to Minster-street, to call on Mrs. Hoxton, as in old times, and take her the newest
      foreign device of working to kill time.</p>
     <p>So a few days passed merrily away, and the great journey commenced. Ethel met the Abbotstoke
      party at the station, and, with a parting injunction to her father, that he was to give all
      his patients a sleeping potion, that they might not miss him, she was carried away from
      Stoneborough.</p>
     <p>Meta was in her gayest mood; Ethel full of glee and wonder, for once beyond Whitford, the
      whole world was new to her; Flora more quiet, but greatly enjoying their delight, and George
      not saying much, but smiling under his beard, as if well pleased to be so well amused with so
      little trouble.</p>
     <p>He took exceeding care of them, and fed them with everything he could make them eat at the
      Swindon station, asking for impossible things, and wishing them so often to change for
      something better, that, if they had been submissive, they would have had no luncheon at all;
      and, as it was, Flora was obliged to whisk into the carriage with her last sandwich in her
      hand.</p>
     <p>'I am the more sorry,' said he, after grumbling at the allotted ten minutes, 'as we shall
      dine so late. You desired Norman to bring any friend he liked, did you not, Flora!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, and he spoke of bringing our old friend, Charles Cheviot, and Mr. Ogilvie,' said
      Flora.</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ogilvie!' said Ethel, 'the Master of Glenbracken! Oh! I am so glad! I have wanted so
      much to see him!'</p>
     <p>'Ah! he is a great hero of yours,' said Flora?</p>
     <p>'Do you know him?' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'No; but he is a great friend of Norman's, and a Scottish cousin —Norman Ogilvie. Norman has
      his name from the Ogilvies.'</p>
     <p>'Our grandmother, Mrs. Mackenzie, was a daughter of Lord Glenbracken,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'This man might be called the Master of Glenbracken at home,' said Ethel. 'It is such a
      pretty title, and there is a beautiful history belonging to them. There was a Master of
      Glenbracken who carried James IV.'s standard at Flodden, and would not yield,
      <pb n="417"/> and was killed with it wrapped round his body, and the Lion was dyed with his
      blood. Mamma knew some scraps of a ballad about him. Then they were out with Montrose, and had
      their castle burnt by the Covenanters, and since that they have been Jacobites, and one barely
      escaped being beheaded at Carlisle! I want to hear the rights of it! Norman is to go, some
      time or other, to stay at Glenbracken!'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Flora, 'coming down to times present, this young heir seems worthy of his race.
      They are pattern people—have built a Church, and have all their tenantry in excellent order.
      This is the only son, and very good and clever—he preferred going to Balliol, that he might
      work; but he is a great sportsman, George,' added she; 'you will get on with him very well,
      about fishing, and grouse shooting, I dare say.'</p>
     <p>Norman met them at the station, and there was great excitement at seeing his long nose under
      his College cap. He looked rather thin and worn, but brightened at the sight of the party.
      After the question—whether there had been any letters from Harry? he asked whether his father
      were coming?—and Ethel thought he seemed nervous at the idea of this addition to his audience.
      He saw them to their hotel, and, promising them his two guests, departed.</p>
     <p>Ethel watched collegiate figures passing in the street, and recollected the grey buildings,
      just glimpsed at in her drive—it was dreamy and confused, and she stood musing, not
      discovering that it was time to dress, till Flora, and her Frenchwoman, came in, and laid
      violent hands on her.</p>
     <p>The effect of their manipulations was very successful. Ethel was made to look well-dressed,
      and, still more, distinguished. Her height told well, when her lankiness was overcome, and her
      hair was disposed so as to set off her features to advantage. The glow of amusement and
      pleasure did still more for her; and Norman, who was in the parlour when the sisters appeared,
      quite started with surprise and satisfaction at her aspect.</p>
     <p>'Well done, Flora!' he said. 'Why! I have been telling Ogilvie that one of my sisters was
      very plain!'</p>
     <p>'Then, I hope we have been preparing an agreeable surprise for him,' said Flora. 'Ethel is
      very much obliged to you. By-the-by,' she said, in her universal amity, 'I must ask Harvey
      Anderson to dinner one of these days?'</p>
     <p>Norman started—and his face said, 'Don't.'</p>
     <p>'O, very well; it is as you please. I though it would please Stoneborough, and that Edward
      was a <hi>protégé</hi> of yours. What has
      <pb n="418"/> he been doing? Did we not hear he had been distinguishing himself? Dr. Hoxton
      was boasting of his two scholars.'</p>
     <p>'Ask him,' said Norman, hurriedly. 'At least,' said he, 'do not let anything from me prevent
      you.'</p>
     <p>'Has he been doing anything wrong?' reiterated Flora.</p>
     <p>'Not that I know of,' was the blunt answer; and, at the same instant, Mr. Ogilvie arrived.
      He was a pleasant, high-bred looking gentleman, brown-complexioned, and dark-eyed, with a
      brisk and resolute cast of countenance, that, Ethel thought, might have suited the Norman of
      Glenbracken, who died on the ruddy Lion of Scotland, and speaking with the very same slight
      degree of Scottish intonation as she remembered in her mother, making a most home-like sound
      in her ears.</p>
     <p>Presently, the rest of their own party came down, and, soon after, Charles Cheviot appeared,
      looking as quiet, and tame, as he used to be in the school-boy days, when Norman would bring
      him home, and he used to be too shy to speak a word.</p>
     <p>However, he had learnt the use of his tongue by this time, though it was a very soft one;
      and he stood by Ethel, asking many questions about Stoneborough, while something, apparently
      very spirited and amusing, was going on between the others.</p>
     <p>The dinner went off well—there were few enough for the conversation to be general. The young
      men began to strike out sparks of wit against each other—Flora put in a word or two—Ethel grew
      so much interested in the discussion, that her face lighted up, and she joined in it, as if it
      had been only between her father and brother—keen, clear, and droll. After that, she had her
      full share in the conversation, and enjoyed it so much that, when she left the dinner-table,
      she fetched her writing-case, to sketch the colloquy, for Margaret and her father.</p>
     <p>Flora exclaimed at her, for never allowing anyone to think of rest. Meta said she should
      like to do the same, but it was impossible now; she did not know how she should ever settle
      down to write a letter. Ethel was soon interrupted—the gentlemen entered, and Mr. Ogilvie came
      to the window, where she was sitting, and began to tell her how much obliged to her he and his
      College were, for having insisted on her brother's sending in his poem. 'Thanks are due, for
      our being spared an infliction, next week,' he said.</p>
     <p>'Have you seen it?' she asked, and she was amused by the quick negative movement of his
      head.</p>
     <p>'I read my friend's poems? But our lungs are prepared! Will you give me my cue—it is of no
      use to ask him when we are to deafen you. One generally knows the crack passages—something
      <pb n="419"/> beginning with "O woman!" but it is well to be in readiness—if you would only
      forewarn me of the telling hits?'</p>
     <p>'If they cannot tell themselves,' said Ethel, smiling, 'I don't think they deserve the
      name.'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps you think what does tell on the undergraduates, collectively, is not always what
      ought to tell on them.'</p>
     <p>'I don't know. I dare say the same would not be a favourite with them and with me.'</p>
     <p>'I should like to know which are your favourites. No doubt you have a copy here—made by
      yourself—' and he looked towards her paper-case.</p>
     <p>There was the copy, and she took it out, peering to see whether Norman were looking.</p>
     <p>'Let me see,' he said, as she paused to open the MS., 'he told me the thoughts were more
      yours than his own.'</p>
     <p>'Did he? That was not fair. One thought was an old one, long ago talked over between us; the
      rest is all his own.'</p>
     <p>Here Mr. Ogilvie took the paper, and Ethel saw his countenance shew evident tokens of
      surprise and feeling.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' he said, presently, 'May goes deep—deeper than most men—though I doubt whether they
      will applaud this.'</p>
     <p>'I should like it better if they did not,' said Ethel. 'It is rather to be felt than shouted
      at.'</p>
     <p>'And I don't know how the world would go on if it were felt. Few men would do much without
      the hope of fame,' said Norman Ogilvie.</p>
     <p>'Is it the question what they <hi>would</hi> do?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'So you call fame a low motive? I see where your brother's philosophy comes from.</p>
     <p>'I do not call it a low motive—' Her pause was expressive.</p>
     <p>'Nor allow that the <hi>Non omnis moriar</hi> of Horace has in it something divine?'</p>
     <p>'For a heathen—yes.'</p>
     <p>'And pray, what would you have the moving spring?'</p>
     <p>'Duty.'</p>
     <p>'Would not that end in, "Mine be a cot, beside the rill?"' said he, with an intonation of
      absurd sentiment.</p>
     <p>'Well, and suppose an enemy came, would duty prompt not the Hay with the yoke—or Winkelried
      on the spears?'</p>
     <p>'Nay, why not—"It is my duty to take care of Lucy."'</p>
     <p>'Then Lucy ought to be broken on her own wheel.'</p>
     <p>'Not at all! It is Lucy's duty to keep her Colin from running into danger.'</p>
     <p>'I hope there are not many Lucies who would think so.'</p>
     <pb n="420"/>
     <p>'I agree with you. Most would rather have Colin killed than disgraced.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure!' then, perceiving a knowing twinkle, as if he thought she had made an
      admission, she added, 'but what is disgrace?'</p>
     <p>'Some say it is misfortune,' said Mr. Ogilvie.</p>
     <p>'Is it not failure in duty?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Well!'</p>
     <p>'Colin's first duty is to his king and country. If he fail in that, he is disgraced, in his
      own eyes, before Heaven, and men. If he does it, there is a reward, which seems to me a
      better, more powerful motive for Lucy to set before him than, "My dear, I hope you will
      distinguish yourself," when, the fact is, "England has forty thousand men,    We trust, as
      good as he." </p>
     <p>'"Victory or Westminster Abbey!" is a tolerable war cry,' said Mr. Ogilvie.</p>
     <p>'Not so good as "England expects every man to do his duty." That serves for those who cannot
      look to Westminster Abbey.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! you are an English woman!'</p>
     <p>'Only by halves. I had rather have been the Master of Glenbracken at Flodden than King
      James, or—' for she grew rather ashamed of having been impelled to utter the personal
      allusion, 'better to have been the Swinton or the Gordon at Homildon, than all the rest put
      together.'</p>
     <p>'I always thought Swinton a pig-headed old fellow, and I have little doubt that my ancestor
      was a young ruffian,' coolly answered the Master of Glenbracken.</p>
     <p>'Why?' was all that Ethel could say in her indignation.</p>
     <p>'It was the normal state of Scottish gentlemen,' he answered.</p>
     <p>'If I thought you were in earnest, I should say you did not deserve to be a Scot.'</p>
     <p>'And so you wish to make me out a fause Scot!'</p>
     <p>'Ogilvie!' called Norman, 'are you fighting Scottish and English battles with Ethel there?
      We want you to tell us which will be the best day for going to Blenheim.'</p>
     <p>The rest of the evening was spent in arranging the programme of their lionizing, in which it
      appeared that the Scottish cousin intended to take his full share. Ethel was not sorry, for he
      interested her much, while provoking her. She was obliged to put out her full strength in
      answering him, and felt, at the same time, that he was not making any effort in using the
      arguments that puzzled her —she was in earnest, while he was at play; and, though there was
      something teasing in this, and she knew it partook of what her
      <pb n="421"/> brothers called chaffing, it gave her that sense of power on his side, which is
      always attractive to women. With the knowledge, that through Norman, she had of his real
      character, she understood that half, at least, of what he said, was jest; and the other half
      was enough in earnest to make it exciting to argue with him.</p>

      <l>While I, thy dearest, sat apart,</l>

     <p>That was a week of weeks; the most memorable week in Ethel's life, spent in
      indefatigable sight-seeing. College Chapels, Bodleian Library, Taylor Gallery, the Museum, all
      were thoroughly studied, and, if Flora had not dragged the party on, in mercy to poor George's
      patience, Ethel would never have got through a day's work.</p>
     <p>Indeed, Mr. Ogilvie, when annoyed at being hurried in going over Merton Chapel with her, was
      heard to whisper that he acted the part of policeman, by a perpetual "move on;" and as Ethel
      recollected the portly form and wooden face of the superintendent at Stoneborough, she was
      afraid that the comparison would not soon be forgotten. Norman Ogilvie seemed to consider
      himself bound to their train as much as his namesake, or, as on the second morning, Norman
      reported his reasoning, it was that a man must walk about with somebody in Commemoration week,
      and that it was a comfort to do so with ladies who wore their bonnets upon their heads,
      instead of, like most of those he met, remind him of what Cock Robin said to Jenny Wren in
      that matrimonial quarrel, when Robin, he grew angry, Hopped upon a twig— </p>
     <p>Flora was extremely delighted, and, in matronly fashion, told her sister that people were
      always respected and admired who had the strength of mind to resist unsuitable customs. Ethel
      laughed in answer, and said, she thought it would take a great deal more strength of mind to
      go about with her whole visage exposed to the universal gaze; and, woman like, they had a
      thorough gossip over the evils of the "back-sliding" head-gear.</p>
     <pb n="422"/>
     <p>Norman had retreated from it into the window, when Flora returned to the charge about Harvey
      Anderson. She had been questioning their old friend Mr. Everard, and had learnt from him that
      the cause of the hesitation, with which his name had been received, was that he had become
      imbued with some of the Rationalistic ideas current in some quarters. He seldom met Norman May
      without forcing on him debates, which were subjects of great interest to the hearers, as the
      two young men were considered as the most distinguished representatives of their respective
      causes, among their own immediate contemporaries. Norman's powers of argument, his eloquence,
      readiness, and clearness, were thought to rank very high, and, in the opinion of Mr. Everard,
      had been of great effect in preventing other youths from being carried away by the specious
      brilliancy of his rival.</p>
     <p>Ethel valued this testimony far above the Newdigate prize, and she was extremely surprised
      by hearing Flora declare her intention of still asking Mr. Anderson to dinner, only consulting
      her brother as to the day.</p>
     <p>'Why, Flora! ask him! Norman—'</p>
     <p>Norman had turned away with the simple answer, "any day."</p>
     <p>'Norman is wiser than you are, Ethel,' said Flora. He knows that Stoneborough would be up in
      arms at any neglect from us to one of the Andersons, and, considering the rivalship, it is the
      more graceful and becoming.'</p>
     <p>'I do not think it right,' said Ethel, stoutly; 'I believe that a a line ought to be drawn,
      and that we ought not to associate with people who openly tamper with their faith.'</p>
     <p>'Never fear,' smiled Flora; 'I promise you that there shall be no debates at <hi>my</hi>
      table.'</p>
     <p>Ethel felt the force of the pronoun, and, as Flora walked out of the room, she went up to
      Norman, who had been resting his brow against the window.</p>
     <p>'It is vain to argue with her,' she said: 'but, Norman, do not you think it is clearly wrong
      to seek after men who desert and deny—'</p>
     <p>She stopped short, frightened at his pale look.</p>
     <p>He spoke in a clear low tone, that seemed to thrill her with a sort of alarm. 'If the
      secrets of men's hearts were probed, who could cast the first stone?'</p>
     <p>'I don't want to cast stones,' she began; but he made a gesture as if he would not hear,
      and, at the same moment, Mr. Ogilvie entered the room.</p>
     <p>Had Ethel been at home, she would have pondered much over her brother's meaning—here she had
      no leisure. Not only was she
      <pb n="423"/> fully occupied with the new scenes around, but her Scottish cousin took up every
      moment open to conversation. He was older than Norman, and had just taken his degree, and he
      talked with that superior <hi>aplomb</hi> , which a few years bestow at their time of life,
      without conceit, but more hopeful and ambitious, and with higher spirits than his cousin.</p>
     <p>Though industrious and distinguished, he had not avoided society or amusement, was a great
      cricketer and tennis-player, one of the "eight" whose success in the boat-races was one of
      Norman's prime interests, and he told stories of frolics that reminded Ethel of her father's
      old Cambridge adventures.</p>
     <p>He was a new variety in her eyes, and entertained her greatly. Where the bounds of banter
      ended, was not easy to define, but whenever he tried a little mystification, she either
      entered merrily into the humour, or threw it over with keen wit that he kept constantly on the
      stretch. They were always discovering odd, unexpected bits of knowledge in each other, and a
      great deal more accordance in views and opinions than appeared on the surface, for his
      enthusiasm usually veiled itself in persiflage on hers, though he was too good and serious at
      heart to carry it too far.</p>
     <p>At Blenheim, perhaps he thought he had given an overdose of nonsense, and made her believe,
      as Meta really did, that the Duchess Sarah was his model woman; for as they walked in the park
      in search of Phoebe Mayflower's well, he gathered a fern leaf, to shew her the Glenbracken
      badge, and talked to her of his home, his mother, and his sister Marjorie, and the little
      Church in the rocky glen. He gave the history of the stolen meetings of the little knot of
      Churchmen during the days of persecution, and shewed a heart descended straight from the
      Ogilvie who was "out with Montrose," now that the upper structure of young England was for a
      little while put aside.</p>
     <p>After this, she took his jokes much more coolly, and made thrusts beneath them, which he
      seemed to enjoy, and caused him to unfold himself the more. She liked him all the better for
      finding that he thought Norman had been a very good friend to him, and that he admired her
      brother heartily, watching tenderly over his tendencies to make himself unhappy. He confided
      to her that, much as he rejoiced in the defeats of Anderson, he feared that the reading and
      thought consequent on the discussions, had helped to overstrain Norman's mind, and he was very
      anxious to carry him away from all study, and toil, and make his brains rest, and his eyes
      delight themselves upon Scottish mountains.</p>
     <p>Thereupon came vivid descriptions of the scenery, especially his own glen with the ruined
      tower, and ardent wishes that his cousin
      <pb n="424"/> Ethel could see them also, and know Marjorie. She could quite echo the wish,
      Edinburgh and Loch Katrine had been the visions of her life, and now that she had once taken
      the leap and left home, absence did not seem impossible, and, with a start of delight, she
      hailed her own conviction that he intended his mother to invite the party to Glenbracken.</p>
     <p>After Norman's visit, Mr. Ogilvie declared that he must come home with him and pay his
      long-promised visit to Stoneborough. He should have come long ago. He had been coming last
      winter, but the wedding had prevented him; he had always wished to know Dr. May, whom his
      father well remembered, and now nothing should keep him away!</p>
     <p>Flora looked on amused and pleased at Ethel's development—her abruptness softened into
      piquancy, and her countenance so embellished, that the irregularity only added to the
      expressiveness. There was no saying what Ethel would come to! She had not said that she would
      not go to the intended ball, and her grimaces at the mention of it were growing fainter every
      day.</p>
     <p>The discussion about Harvey Anderson was never revived; Flora sent the invitation without
      another word—he came with half-a-dozen other gentlemen—Ethel made him a civil greeting, but
      her head was full of boats and the procession day, about which Mr. Ogilvie was telling her,
      and she thought of him no more.</p>
     <p>'A lucky step!' thought Flora. 'A grand thing for Ethel—a capital connection for us all.
      Lady Glenbracken will not come too much into my sphere either. Yes, I am doing well by my
      sisters.'</p>
     <p>It would make stay-at-home people giddy to record how much pleasure, how much conversation
      and laughter were crowded into those ten days, and with much thought and feeling beside them,
      for these were not girls on whom grave Oxford could leave no impression but one of gaiety.</p>
     <p>The whole party was very full of merriment. Norman May, especially, on whom Flora contrived
      to devolve that real leadership of conversation that should rightly have belonged to George
      Rivers, kept up the ball with wit and drollery far beyond what he usually put forth; enlivened
      George into being almost an agreeable man, and drew out little Meta's vivacity into sunny
      sparkles.</p>
     <p>Meta generally had Norman for her share, and seemed highly contented with his lionizings,
      which were given much more quietly and copiously than those which his cousin bestowed upon his
      sister. Or if there were anything enterprising to be done, any tower to be mounted, or
      anything with the smallest spice of danger in it, Meta was charmed, and with her lightness and
      airiness of foot and figure, and perfectly feminine ways, showed a spirit of
      <pb n="425"/> adventure that added to the general diversion. But if she were to be helped up
      or down anywhere, she certainly seemed to find greater security in Norman May's assistance,
      though it was but a feather-like touch that she ever used to aid her bounding step.</p>
     <p>Both as being diffident, and, in a manner at home, Norman was not as constantly her cavalier
      as was Mr. Ogilvie to his sister; and, when supplanted, his wont was either to pioneer for
      Flora, or, if she did not need him, to walk alone, grave and abstracted. There was a weight on
      his brow, when nothing was going on to drive it away, and whether it were nervousness as to
      the performance in store for him, anxiety about Harry, or, as Mr. Ogilvie said, too severe
      application; some burthen hung upon him, that was only lightened for the time by his
      participation in the enjoyment of the party.</p>
     <p>On Sunday evening, when they had been entering into the almost vision-like delight of the
      choicest of music, and other accompaniments of Church service, they went to walk in
      Christchurch meadows. They had begun altogether by comparing feelings—Ethel wondering whether
      Stoneborough Minster would ever be used as it might be, and whether, if so, they should be
      practically the better for it; and proceeding with metaphysics on her side, and satire on
      Norman Ogilvie's, to speculate whether that which is, is best, and the rights and wrongs of
      striving for change and improvements, what should begin from above, and what from beneath—with
      illustrations often laughter-moving, though they were much in earnest, as the young heir of
      Glenbracken looked into his future life.</p>
     <p>Flora had diverged into wondering who would have the living after poor old Mr. Ramsden, and
      walked, keeping her husband amused with instances of his blunders.</p>
     <p>Meta, as with Norman she parted from the rest, thought her own dear Abbotstoke Church, and
      Mr. Charles Wilmot, great subjects for content and thanksgiving, though it was a wonderful
      treat to see and hear such as she had enjoyed to-day; and she thought it was a joy, to carry
      away abidingly, to know that praise and worship, as near perfection as this earth could render
      them, were being offered up.</p>
     <p>Norman understood her thought, but responded by more of a sigh than was quite
      comfortable.</p>
     <p>Meta went on with her own thoughts, on the connection between worship and good works, how
      the one leads to the other, and how praise, with pure lips is, after all, the great purpose of
      existence.— Her last thought she spoke aloud.</p>
     <p>'I suppose everything, our own happiness and all, are given to us to turn into praise,' she
      said.</p>
     <pb n="426"/>
     <p>'Yes—' echoed Norman; but as if his thoughts were not quite with hers, or rather in another
      part of the same subject; then recalling himself, 'Happy such as can do so.'</p>
     <p>'If one only could—' said Meta—</p>
     <p>'You can—don't say otherwise,' exclaimed Norman; 'I know, at least, that you and my father
      can.'</p>
     <p>'Dr. May does so, more than anyone I know,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman again; it is his secret of joy. To him, it is never, 'I am half sick of
      shadows.'</p>
     <p>'To him they are not shadows, but foretastes,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>Silence again; and when she spoke, she said, 'I have always thought it must be such a
      happiness to have power of any kind that can be used in direct service, or actual doing
      good.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Norman. 'Whatever becomes a profession, becomes an unreality.'</p>
     <p>'Surely not, in becoming a duty,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'Not for all,' he answered; 'but where the fabric erected by ourselves, in the sight of the
      world, is but an outer case, a shell of mere words, blown up for the occasion, strung together
      as mere language; then, self-convicted, we shrink within the husk, and feel our own
      worthlessness and hypocrisy.'</p>
     <p>'As one feels in reproving the school children for behaving ill at Church?' said Meta.</p>
     <p><hi>'You</hi> never felt anything approaching to it!' said Norman. 'To know oneself to be
      such a deception, that everything else seems a delusion too!'</p>
     <p>'I don't know whether that is metaphysical,' said Meta, 'but I am sure I don't understand
      it. One must know oneself to be worse than one knows any one else to be.'</p>
     <p>'I could not wish you to understand,' said Norman; and yet he seemed impelled to go on; for,
      after a hesitating silence, he added, 'When the wanderer in the desert fears that the spring
      is but a mirage; or when all that is held dear is made hazy or distorted by some enchanter,
      what do you think are the feelings, Meta?'</p>
     <p>'It must be dreadful,' she said, rather bewildered; 'but he may know it is a delusion, if he
      can but wake. Has he not always a spell, a charm?—'</p>
     <p>'What is the spell?' eagerly said Norman, standing still.</p>
     <p>"Believe—" said Meta, hardly knowing how she came to choose the words.</p>
     <p>"I believe!" he repeated. 'What—when we go beyond the province of reason—human, a thing of
      sense after all! How often have I so answered. But Meta, when a man has been drawn, in
      self-sufficient security, to look into a magic mirror, and cannot detach
      <pb n="427"/> his eyes from the confused, misty scene—where all that had his allegiance
      appears shattered, overthrown, like a broken image, or at least unable to endure examination,
      then—'</p>
     <p>'O Norman, is that the trial to anyone here? I thought old Oxford was the great guardian
      nurse of truth! I am sure she cannot deal in magic mirrors or such frightful things. Do you
      know you are talking like a very horrible dream?'</p>
     <p>'I believe I am in one,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'To be sure you are. Wake!' said Meta, looking up, smiling in his face. 'You have read
      yourself into a maze, that's all—what Mary calls, muzzling your head; you don't really think
      all this, and when you get into the country, away from books, you will forget it. One look at
      our dear old purple Welsh hills will blow away all the mists!'</p>
     <p>'I ought not to have spoken in this manner,' said Norman sadly. 'Forget it, Meta.'</p>
     <p>'Forget it! Of course I will. It is all nonsense, and meant to be forgotten,' said Meta,
      laughing. 'You will own that it is by-and-by.'</p>
     <p>He gave a deep sigh.</p>
     <p>'Don't think I am unfeeling,' she said; 'but I know it is all a fog up from books, books,
      books—I should like to drive it off with a good fresh gust of wind! Oh! I wish those yellow
      lilies would grow in our river!'</p>
     <p>Meta talked away gaily for the rest of the walk. She was anything but unfeeling, but she had
      a confidence in Norman that forbade her to see anything here but one of his variations of
      spirits, which always sank in the hour of triumph. She put forth her brightness to enliven
      him, and, in their subsequent <hi>tête à têtes</hi> , she avoided all that could lead to a
      renewal of this conversation. Ethel would not have rested till it had been fought out. Meta
      thought it so imaginary, that it had better die for want of the aliment of words; certainly,
      hers could not reach an intellect like his, and she would only soothe and amuse him. Dr. May,
      mind-curer, as well as body-curer, would soon be here, to put the climax to the general joy,
      and watch his own son.</p>
     <p>He did arrive; quite prepared to enjoy, giving an excellent account of both homes; Mr.
      Rivers very well, and the Wilmots taking care of him, and Margaret as comfortable as usual,
      Mary making a most important and capable little housekeeper, Miss Bracy as good as possible.
      He talked as if they had all flourished the better for Ethel's absence, but he had evidently
      missed her greatly, as he shewed, without knowing it, by his instant eagerness to have
      <pb n="428"/> her to himself. Even Norman, prizeman as he was, was less wanted. There was
      proud affection, eager congratulation, for him, but it was Ethel to whom he wanted to tell
      everything that had passed during her absence—whom he treated as if they were meeting after a
      tedious separation.</p>
     <p>They dined rather early, and went out afterwards, to walk down the High Street to Christ
      Church Meadow. Norman and Ethel had been anxious for this; they thought it would give their
      father the best idea of the <hi>tout ensemble</hi> of Oxford, and were not without hopes of
      beating him by his own confession, in that standing fight between him and his sons, as to the
      beauties of Oxford and Cambridge—a fight in which, hitherto, they had been equally
      matched—neither partizan having seen the rival University.</p>
     <p>Flora staid at home; she owned herself fairly tired by her arduous duties of following the
      two young ladies about, and was very glad to give her father the keeping of them. Dr. May held
      out his arm to Ethel—Norman secured his peculiar property. Ethel could have preferred that it
      should be otherwise—Norman would have no companion but George Rivers; how bored he would
      be!</p>
     <p>All through the streets, while she was telling her father the names of the buildings, she
      was not giving her whole attention; she was trying to guess, from the sounds behind, whether
      Mr. Ogilvie were accompanying them. They entered the meadows—Norman turned round, with a
      laugh, to defy the Doctor to talk of the Cam, on the banks of the Isis. The party stood
      still—the other two gentlemen came up. They amalgamated again—all the Oxonians conspiring to
      say spiteful things of the Cam, and Dr. May making a spirited defence, in which Ethel found
      herself impelled to join.</p>
     <p>In the wide gravelled path, they proceeded in threes; George attached himself to his sister
      and Norman. Mr. Ogilvie came to Ethel's other side, and began to point out all the various
      notabilities. Ethel was happy again; her father was so much pleased and amused, with him, and
      he with her father, that it was a treat to look on.</p>
     <p>Presently, Dr. May, as usual, always meeting with acquaintances, fell in with a county
      neighbour, and Ethel had another pleasant aside, until her father claimed her, and Mr. Ogilvie
      was absorbed among another party, and lost to her sight.</p>
     <p>He came to tea, but, by that time, Dr. May had established himself in the chair, which had,
      hitherto, been appropriated to her cousin, a chair that cut her nook off from the rest of the
      world, and made her the exclusive possession of the occupant. There was a
      <pb n="429"/> most interesting history for her to hear, of a meeting with the Town Council,
      which she had left pending, when Dr. May had been battling to save the next presentation of
      the living from being sold.</p>
     <p>Few subjects could affect Ethel more nearly, yet she caught herself missing the thread of
      his discourse, in trying to hear what Mr. Ogilvie was saying to Flora about a visit to
      Glenbracken.</p>
     <p>The time came for the two Balliol men to take their leave. Norman May had been sitting very
      silent all the evening, and Meta, who was near him, respected his mood. When he said
      good-night, he drew Ethel outside the door. 'Ethel,' he said, 'only one thing: do ask my
      father not to put on his spectacles to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'Very well,' said Ethel, half smiling; 'Richard did not mind them.'</p>
     <p>'Richard has more humility—I shall break down if he looks at me! I wish you were all at
      home.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you.'</p>
     <p>The other Norman came out of the sitting-room at the moment, and heard the last words.</p>
     <p>'Never mind,' said he to Ethel, 'I'll take care of him. He shall comport himself as if you
      were all at Nova Zembla. A pretty fellow to talk of despising fame, and then get a fit of
      stage-fright!'</p>
     <p>'Well, good-night,' said Norman, sighing. 'It will be over to-morrow; only remember the
      spectacles.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May laughed a good deal at the request, and asked if the rest of the party were to be
      blindfolded. Meta wondered that Ethel should have mentioned the request so publicly; she was a
      good deal touched by it, and she thought Dr. May ought to be so.</p>
     <p>Good-night was said, and Dr. May put his arm round Ethel, and gave her the kiss that she had
      missed for seven nights. It was very homelike, and it brought a sudden flash of thought across
      Ethel! What had she been doing? She had been impatient of her father's monopoly of her!</p>
     <p>She parted with Flora, and entered the room she shared with Meta, where Bellairs waited to
      attend her little mistress. Few words passed between the two girls, and those chiefly on the
      morrow's dress. Meta had some fixed ideas—she should wear pink. Norman had said he liked her
      pink bonnet, and then she could put down her white veil, so that he could be certain that she
      was not looking; Ethel vaguely believed Flora meant her to wear—something—</p>
     <p>Bellairs went away, and Meta gave expression to her eager hope that Norman would go through
      it well. If he would only read it, as he did last Easter to her and Ethel.</p>
     <p>'He will,' said Ethel. 'This nervousness always wears off when it comes to the point, and he
      warms with his subject.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! but think of all the eyes looking at him!'</p>
     <pb n="430"/>
     <p>'Our's are all that he really cares for, and he will think of none of them, when he begins.
      No, Meta, you must not encourage him in it. Papa says, if he did not think it half morbid—the
      result of <hi>the</hi> shock to his nerves—he should be angry with it as a sort of
      conceit!'</p>
     <p>'I should have thought <hi>that</hi> the last thing to be said of Norman!' said Meta, with a
      little suppressed indignation.</p>
     <p>'It was once in his nature,' said Ethel; 'and I think it is the fault he most beats down.
      There was a time, before you knew him, when he would have been vain and ambitious.'</p>
     <p>'Then it is as they say, conquered faults grow to be the opposite virtues!' said Meta. 'How
      very good he is, Ethel; one sees it more when he is with other people, and one hears all these
      young men's stories!'</p>
     <p>'Everything Norman does not do, is not therefore wrong,' said Ethel, with her usual lucidity
      of expression.</p>
     <p>'Don't you like him the better for keeping out of all these follies?'</p>
     <p>'Norman does not call them so, I am sure.'</p>
     <p>'No, he is too good to condemn—'</p>
     <p>'It is not only that,' said Ethel. 'I know papa thinks that the first grief, coming at his
      age, and in the manner it did, checked and subdued his spirits, so that he has little pleasure
      in those things. And he always meant to be a Clergyman, which acted as a sort of Consecration
      on him; but many things are innocent, and I do believe papa would like it better, if Norman
      were less grave.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Meta, remembering the Sunday talk, 'but still, he would not be all he is—so
      different from others—'</p>
     <p>'Of course, I don't mean less good, only, less grave,' said Ethel, 'and certainly less
      nervous. But, perhaps, it is a good thing; dear mamma thought his talents would have been a
      greater temptation than they seem to be, subdued as he has been. I only meant that you must
      not condemn all that Norman does not do. Now, good-night.'</p>
     <p>Very different were the feelings with which those two young girls stretched themselves in
      their beds that night. Margaret Rivers's innocent, happy little heart was taken up in one
      contemplation. Admiration, sympathy, and the exultation for him, which he would not feel for
      himself, drew little Meta entirely out of herself—a self that never held her much. She was
      proud of the slender thread of connexion between them; she was confident that his vague
      fancies were but the scruples of a sensitive mind, and, as she fell sound asleep, she murmured
      broken lines of Decius, mixed with promises not to look.</p>
     <p>Etheldred heard them, for there was no sleep for her. She had
      <pb n="431"/> a parley to hold with herself, and to accuse her own feelings of having been
      unkind, ungrateful, undutiful towards her father. What had a fit of vanity brought her to?
      that she should have been teazed by what would naturally have been her greatest delight! her
      father's pleasure in being with her. Was this the girl who had lately vowed within herself
      that her father should be her first earthly object?</p>
     <p>At first, Ethel blamed herself for her secret impatience, but another conviction crossed
      her, and not an unpleasing one, though it made her cheeks tingle with maidenly shame, at
      having called it up. Throughout this week, Norman Ogilvie had certainly sought her out. He had
      looked disappointed this evening—there was no doubt that he was attracted by her—by her,
      plain, awkward Ethel! Such a perception assuredly never gave so much pleasure to a beauty as
      it did to Ethel, who had always believed herself far less good-looking than she really was. It
      was a gleam of delight, and, though she set herself to scold it down, the conviction was
      elastic, and always leapt up again.</p>
     <p>That resolution came before her, but it had been unspoken; it could not be binding, and, if
      her notion were really right, the misty brilliant future of mutual joy dazzled her! But there
      was another side: her father oppressed and lonely, Margaret ill and pining, Mary, neither
      companion nor authority, the children running wild; and she, who had mentally vowed never to
      forsake her father, far away, enjoying her own happiness. 'Ah! that resolve had seemed easy
      enough when it was made, when,' thought Ethel, 'I fancied no one could care for me! Shame on
      me! Now is the time to test it! I must go home with papa.'</p>
     <p>It was a great struggle—on one side there was the deceitful guise of modesty, telling her it
      was absurd to give so much importance to the kindness of the first cousin, with whom she had
      ever been thrown; there was the dislike to vex Flora to make a discussion, and break up the
      party. There was the desire to hear the concert, to go to the breakfast at—College, to return
      round by Warwick Castle, and Kenilworth, as designed. Should she lose all this for a mere
      flattering fancy. She, who had laughed at Miss Boulder, for imagining every one who spoke to
      her was smitten. What reason could she assign? It would be simply ridiculous, and unkind—and
      it was so very pleasant. Mr. Ogilvie would be too wise to think of so incongruous a connexion,
      which would be so sure to displease his parents. It was more absurd than ever to think of it.
      The heir of Glenbracken, and a country physician's daughter!</p>
     <p>That was a candid heart which owned that its own repugnance to
      <pb n="432"/> accept this disparity as an objection, was an additional evidence that she ought
      to flee from further intercourse. She believed that no harm was done yet; she was sure that
      she loved her father better than anything else in the world, and whilst she did so, it was
      best to preserve her heart for him. Widowed as he was, she knew that he would sorely miss her,
      and that for years to come, she should be necessary at home. She had better come away while it
      would cost only a slight pang, for that it was pain to leave Norman Ogilvie, was symptom
      enough of the need of not letting her own silly heart go further. However it might be with
      him, another week would only make it worse with her.</p>
     <p>'I will go home with papa!' was the ultimatum reached by each chain of mental reasonings,
      and borne in after each short prayer for guidance, as Ethel tossed about listening to the
      perpetual striking of all the Oxford clocks, until daylight had begun to shine in; when she
      fell asleep, and was only waked by Meta, standing over her with a sponge, looking very
      mischievous, as she reminded her of their appointment with Dr. May, to go to the early service
      in New College Chapel.</p>
     <p>The world looked different that morning with Ethel, but the determination was fixed, and the
      service strengthened it. She was so silent during the walk, that her companions rallied her,
      and they both supposed she was anxious about Norman; but taking her opportunity, when Meta was
      gone to prepare for breakfast, she rushed, in her usual way, into the subject. 'Papa! if you
      please, I should like to go home to-morrow with you.'</p>
     <p>'Eh?' said the Doctor, amazed: 'How is this? I told you that Miss Bracy and Mary are doing
      famously.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, but I had rather go back.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed!' and Dr. May looked at the door, and spoke low. 'They make you welcome, I
      hope—'</p>
     <p>'Oh! yes, nothing can be kinder.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad to hear it. This Rivers <hi>is</hi> such a lout, that I could not tell how it
      might be. I did not look to see you turn homesick all at once.</p>
     <p>Ethel smiled. 'Yes, I have been very happy; but please, papa, ask no questions—only take me
      home.'</p>
     <p>'Come! it is all a homesick fit, Ethel—never fear the ball. Think of the concert. If it were
      not for that poor baby of Mrs. Larkins, I should stay myself to hear Sonntag again. You won't
      have such another chance.'</p>
     <p>'I know, but I think I ought to go—'</p>
     <p>George came in, and they could say no more. Both were silent on the subject at breakfast,
      but when afterwards Flora seized on
      <pb n="433"/> Ethel, to array her for the theatre, she was able to say, 'Flora, please don't
      be angry with me—you have been very kind to me, but I mean to go home with papa
      to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'I declare!' said Flora, composedly, 'you are as bad as the children at the Infant School,
      crying to go home the instant they see their mothers!'</p>
     <p>'No, Flora, but I must go. Thank you for all this pleasure, but I shall have heard Norman's
      poem, and then I must go.'</p>
     <p>Flora turned her round, looked in her face kindly, kissed her, and said, 'My dear, never
      mind, it will all come right again—only, don't run away.'</p>
     <p>'What will come right?'</p>
     <p>'Any little misunderstanding with Norman Ogilvie.'</p>
     <p>'I don't know what you mean,' said Ethel, becoming scarlet.</p>
     <p>'My dear, you need not try to hide it. I see that you have got into a fright. You have made
      a discovery, but that is no reason for running away.'</p>
     <p>'Yes it is!' said Ethel, firmly, not denying the charge, though reddening more than ever at
      finding her impression confirmed.</p>
     <p>'Poor child! she is afraid!' said Flora, tenderly; 'but I will take care of you, Ethel. It
      is everything delightful. You are the very girl for such a <hi>héros de Roman</hi> , and it
      has embellished you more than all my Paris fineries.'</p>
     <p>'Hush, Flora! We ought not to talk in this way, as if—'</p>
     <p>'As if he had done more than walk with, and talk with, nobody else! How he did hate papa,
      last night. I had a great mind to call papa off, in pity to him.'</p>
     <p>'Don't, Flora. If there were anything in it, it would not be proper to think of it, so I am
      going home to prevent it.' The words were spoken with averted face, and heaving breath.</p>
     <p>'Proper?' said Flora. 'The Mays are a good old family, and our own grandmother was an
      honourable Ogilvie herself. A Scottish Baron, very poor too, has no right to look down—'</p>
     <p>'They shall not look down. Flora, it is of no use to talk. I cannot be spared from home, and
      I will not put myself in the way of being tempted to forsake them all.'</p>
     <p>'Tempted!' said Flora, laughing. 'Is it such a wicked thing?'</p>
     <p>'Not in others, but it would be wrong in me, with such a state of things as there is at
      home.'</p>
     <p>'I do not suppose he would want you for some years to come. He is only two-and-twenty. Mary
      will grow older.'</p>
     <p>'Margaret will either be married, or want constant care. Flora, I will not let myself be
      drawn from them.'</p>
     <p>'You may think so now; but it would be for their real good to
      <pb n="434"/> relieve papa of any of us. If we were all to think as you do, how should we
      live? I don't know—for papa told me there will be barely ten thousand pounds, besides the
      houses, and what will that be among ten? I am not talking of yourself, but, think of the
      others!'</p>
     <p>'I know papa will not be happy without me, and I will not leave him,' repeated Ethel, not
      answering the argument.</p>
     <p>Flora changed her ground, and laughed. 'We are getting into the heroics,' she said, 'when it
      would be very foolish to break up our plans, only because we have found a pleasant cousin.
      There is nothing serious in it, I dare say. How silly of us to argue on such an idea!'</p>
     <p>Meta came in before Flora could say more, but Ethel, with burning cheeks, repeated, 'It will
      be safer!'</p>
     <p>Ethel had, meantime, been dressed by her sister; and, as Bellairs came to adorn Meta, and
      she could have no solitude, she went down stairs, thinking she heard Norman's step, and hoping
      to judge of his mood.</p>
     <p>She entered the room with an exclamation—'O Norman!'</p>
     <p>'At your service!' said the wrong Norman, looking merrily up, from behind a newspaper.</p>
     <p>'Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought—'</p>
     <p>'Your thoughts were quite right,' he said, smiling. 'Your brother desires me to present his
      respects to his honoured family, and to inform them that his stock of assurance is likely to
      be diminished by the pleasure of their company this morning.'</p>
     <p>'How is he?' asked Ethel, anxiously.</p>
     <p>'Pretty fair. He has blue saucers round his eyes, as he had before he went up for his little
      go.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, I know them,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Very odd,' continued her cousin; 'when the end always is, that he says he has the luck of
      being set on in the very place he knows best. But, I think it has expended itself in a
      sleepless night, and I have no fears, when he comes to the point.'</p>
     <p>'What is he doing?'</p>
     <p>'Writing to his brother Harry. He said it was the day for the Pacific mail, and that Harry's
      pleasure would be the best of it.'</p>
     <p>'Ah!' said Ethel, glancing towards the paper, 'Is there any naval intelligence?'</p>
     <p>He looked; and while she was thinking whether she ought not to depart, he exclaimed, in a
      tone that startled her, 'Ha! No. Is your brother's ship the Alcestis?'</p>
     <p>'Yes! Oh, what?'</p>
     <p>Nothing then, I assure you. See, it is merely this—she has not come into Sydney so soon as
      expected, which you knew before. That is all.'</p>
     <pb n="435"/>
     <p>'Let me see,' said the trembling Ethel.</p>
     <p>It was no more than an echo of their unconfessed apprehensions, yet it seemed to give them a
      body; and Ethel's thoughts flew to Margaret. Her going home would be absolutely necessary now.
      Mr. Ogilvie kindly began to talk away her alarm, saying that there was still no reason for
      dread, mentioning the many causes that might have delayed the ship, and re-assuring her
      greatly.</p>
     <p>'But Norman!' she said.</p>
     <p>'Ah! true. Poor May! He will break down, to a certainty, if he hears it. I will go at once,
      and keep guard over him, lest he should meet with this paper. But, pray don't be alarmed. I
      assure you there is no cause. You will have letters to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>Ethel would fain have thrown off her finery and hurried home at once, but no one regarded
      the matter as she did. Dr. May agreed with Flora, that it was no worse than before, and though
      they now thought Ethel's return desirable, on Margaret's account, it would be better not to
      add to the shock by a sudden arrival, especially as they took in no daily paper at home. So
      the theatre was not to be given up, nor any of the subsequent plans, except so far as regarded
      Ethel; and, this agreed, they started for the scene of action.</p>
     <p>They were hardly in the street before they met the ubiquitous Mr. Ogilvie, saying, that
      Cheviot, Norman's prompter, was aware of the report, and was guarding him, while he came to
      escort the ladies, through what he expressively called "the bear fight." Ethel resolutely
      adhered to her father, and her cousin took care of Meta, who had been clinging in a tiptoe
      manner to the point of her brother's high elbow, looking as if the crowd might easily brush
      off such a little fly, without his missing her.</p>
     <p>Inch by inch, a step at a time, the ladies were landed in a crowd of their own sex, where
      Flora bravely pioneered—they emerged on their benches, shook themselves out, and seated
      themselves. There was the swarm of gay ladies, around them, and beneath the area, fast being
      paved with heads, black, brown, grey and bald, a surging living sea, where Meta soon pointed
      out Dr. May and George; the mere sight of such masses of people was curious and interesting,
      reminding Ethel of Cherry Elwood having once shocked her by saying the Whitmonday club was the
      most beautiful sight in the whole year. And above! that gallery of trampling undergraduates,
      and more than trampling! Ethel and Meta could, at first, have found it in their hearts to be
      frightened at those thundering shouts, but the young ladies were usually of opinions so
      similar, that the louder grew the cheers, the more they laughed and exulted, so carried along,
      that no cares could be remembered.</p>
     <pb n="436"/>
     <p>Making a way through the thronged area, behold the procession of scarlet Doctors, advancing
      through the midst, till the red and black Vice-Chancellor sat enthroned in the centre, and the
      scarlet line became a semicircle, dividing the flower-garden of ladies from the black mass
      below.</p>
     <p>Then came the introduction of the honorary Doctors, one by one, with the Latin speech, which
      Ethel's companions unreasonably required her to translate to them, while she was using all her
      ears to catch a word or two, and her eyes to glimpse at the features of men of note.</p>
     <p>By-and-by, a youth made his appearance in the rostrum, and a good deal of Latin ensued, of
      which Flora hoped Ethel was less tired of than she was. In time, however, Meta saw the
      spectacles removed, and George looking straight up, and she drew down her veil, and took hold
      of Flora's hand, and Ethel flushed like a hot coal. Nevertheless, all contrived to see a tall
      figure, with face much flushed, and hands moving nervously! The world was tired, and people
      were departing, so that the first lines were lost, perhaps a satisfaction to Norman, but his
      voice soon cleared and became louder, his eyes lighted, and Ethel knew the "funny state" had
      come to his relief—people's attention was arrested—there was no more going away—</p>
     <p>It was well that Norman was ignorant of the fears for Harry, for four lines had been added
      since Ethel had seen the poem, saying how self-sacrifice sent forth the sailor-boy from home,
      to the lone watch, the wave and storm, his spirit rising high, ere manhood braced his
      form.</p>
     <p>Applause did not come where Ethel had expected it; and, at first, there was silence at the
      close, but, suddenly, the acclamations rose with deafening loudness, though hardly what greets
      some poems with more to catch the popular ear.</p>
     <p>Ethel's great excitement was over, and presently she found herself outside of the theatre, a
      shower falling, and an umbrella held over her by Mr. Ogilvie, who was asking her if it was not
      admirable, and declaring the poem might rank with Heber's Palestine, or Milman's Apollo.</p>
     <p>They were bound for a great luncheon at one of the Colleges, where Ethel might survey the
      Principal with whom Miss Rich had corresponded. Mr. Ogilvie sat next to her, told her all the
      names, and quizzed the dignitaries, but she had a sense of depression, and did not wish to
      enter into the usual strain of banter. He dropped his lively tone; and drew her out about
      Harry, till she was telling eagerly of her dear sailor brother, and found him so sympathizing
      and considerate, that she did not like him less; though she felt her
      <pb n="437"/> intercourse with him a sort of intoxication, that would only make it the worse
      for her by-and-by.</p>
     <p>During that whole luncheon, and their walk through the gardens, where there was a beautiful
      horticultural show, something was always prompting her to say, while in this quasi-privacy,
      that she was on the eve of departure, but she kept her resolution against it— she thought it
      would have been an unwarrantable experiment.</p>
     <p>When they returned to their inn, they found Norman looking fagged, but relieved, half-asleep
      on the sofa, with a novel in his hand. He roused himself as they came in, and, to avoid any
      compliments on his own performance, began—'Well, Ethel, are you ready for the ball?'</p>
     <p>'We shall spare her the ball,' said Dr. May; 'there is a report about the Alcestis, in the
      newspaper, that may make Margaret uncomfortable, and this good sister will not stay away from
      her.'</p>
     <p>Norman started up crying, 'What, papa?'</p>
     <p>'It is a mere nothing in reality,' said Dr. May, 'only what we knew before;' and he shewed
      his son the paragraph, which Norman read as a death warrant—the colour ebbed from his lips and
      cheeks— he trembled so, that he was obliged to sit down, and, without speaking, he kept his
      eyes fixed on the words, "Serious apprehensions are entertained with regard to H. M. S.
      Alcestis, Captain Gordon—"</p>
     <p>'If you had seen as many newspaper reports come to nothing, as I have, you would not take
      this so much to heart,' said Dr. May. 'I expect to hear that this very mail has brought
      letters.'</p>
     <p>And Meta added that, at luncheon, she had been seated next to one of the honorary doctors—a
      naval captain—who had been making discoveries in the South Sea, and that he had scouted the
      notion of harm befalling the Alcestis, and given all manner of reassuring suppositions as to
      her detention, adding besides, that no one believed the Australian paper, whence the report
      was taken. He had seen the Alcestis, knew Captain Gordon, and spoke of him as one of the
      safest people in the world. Had his acquaintance extended to lieutenants and midshipmen, it
      would have been perfect—as it was, the tidings brought back the blood to Norman's cheek, and
      the light to his eye.</p>
     <p>'When do we set off?' was Norman's question.</p>
     <p>'At five,' said Ethel. 'You mean it, papa?'</p>
     <p>'I did intend it, if I had gone alone, but I shall not take you till eight; nor you Norman,
      at all.'</p>
     <p>Norman was bent on returning, but his father and Flora would not hear of it. Flora could not
      spare him, and Dr. May was afraid of the effect of anxiety on nerves and spirits so sensitive.
      While
      <pb n="438"/> this was going on, Mr. Ogilvie looked at Ethel in consternation, and said, 'Are
      you really going home?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, my eldest sister must not be left alone when she hears this.'</p>
     <p>He looked down—Ethel had the resolution to walk away. Flora could not give up the ball, and
      Meta found that she must go; but both the Normans spent a quiet evening with Dr. May and
      Ethel. Norman May had a bad headache, which he was allowed to have justly earned; Dr. May was
      very happy reviving all his Scottish recollections, and talking to young Ogilvie about
      Edinburgh.— Once, there was a private consultation. Ethel was provoked and ashamed at the
      throbs that it <hi>would</hi> excite. What! on a week's acquaintance?—</p>
     <p>When alone with her father, she began to nerve herself for something heroic, and great was
      her shame when she heard only of her cousin's kind consideration for her brother, whom he
      wished to take home with him, and thence to see the Highlands, so as to divert his anxiety for
      Harry, as well as to call him off from the studies with which he had this term overworked
      himself even more than usual. Dr. May had given most grateful consent, and he spoke highly in
      praise of the youth; but there was no more to come, and Ethel could have beaten herself for
      the moment of anticipation.</p>
     <p>Meta came home, apologizing for wakening Ethel—but Ethel had not been asleep. The ball had
      not, it seemed, been as charming to her as most events were, and Ethel heard a sigh, as the
      little lady lay down in her bed.</p>
     <p>Late as it was when she went to rest, Meta rose to see the travellers off—she sent hosts of
      messages to her father, and wished she might go with them. George and Flora were not visible,
      and Dr. May was leaving messages for them, and for Norman, in her charge, when the two Balliol
      men walked in.</p>
     <p>Ethel had hoped it was over, yet she could not be sorry that the two youths escorted them to
      the station, and, as Ethel was placed in the carriage, she believed that she heard something
      of never forgetting— happiest week—but in the civilities which the other occupant of the
      carriage was offering for the accommodation of their lesser luggage, she lost the exact words,
      and the last she heard were, "Good bye—I hope you will find letters at home."</p>

     <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
     <p>True to the kindred points of Heaven and home.</p>
     <p><hi>Wordsworth.</hi></p>
     <p><hi>Etheldred's</hi> dream was over. She had wakened to the inside of a Great Western
      carriage, her father beside her, and opposite a thin, foreign-looking gentleman. Her father,
      to whom her life was to be devoted! She looked at his profile, defined against the window, and
      did not repent. In a sort of impulse to do something for him, she took his hat from his hand,
      and was going to dispose of it in the roof, when he turned, smiling his thanks, but saying,
      'it was not worth while—this carriage was a very transitory resting-place.'</p>
     <p>The stranger at that moment sprang to his feet, exclaiming, 'Dick himself!'</p>
     <p>'Spencer! old fellow, is it you?' cried Dr. May, in a voice of equal amazement and joy,
      holding out his hand, which was grasped and wrung with a force that made Ethel shrink for the
      poor maimed arm.</p>
     <p>'Ha! what is amiss with your arm?' was the immediate question. Three technical words were
      spoken in a matter of fact way, as Dr. May replaced his hand in his bosom, and then, with an
      eager smile, said, 'Ethel, here! You have heard of him!'</p>
     <p>Ethel had indeed, and gave her hand cordially, surprised by the bow and air of deferential
      politeness with which it was received, like a favour, while Dr. Spencer asked her whether she
      had been staying in Oxford.</p>
     <p>'Aye, and what for, do you think?' said Dr. May, joyously.</p>
     <p>'You don't say that was your son who held forth yesterday! I thought his voice had a trick
      of yours—but then I thought you would have held by old Cambridge.'</p>
     <p>'What could I do?' said Dr. May, deprecatingly; 'the boy would go and get a Balliol
      scholarship—'</p>
     <p>'Why! the lad is a genius! a poet—no mistake about it! but I scarcely thought you could have
      one of such an age.'</p>
     <p>'Of his age! His brother is in Holy Orders—one of his sisters is married. There's for you,
      Spencer!'</p>
     <p>'Bless me, Dick! I thought myself a young man!'</p>
     <p>'What! with hair of that colour?' said Dr. May, looking at his friend's milk-white
      locks.</p>
     <p>'Bleached by that frightful sickly season at Poonshedagore, when
      <pb n="440"/> I thought I was done for. But you! you—the boy of the whole lot! You think me
      very disrespectful to your father,' added he, turning to Ethel, 'but you see what old times
      are.'</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Ethel, with a bright look.</p>
     <p>'So you were in the theatre, yesterday,' continued Dr. May; 'but there is no seeing anyone
      in such a throng. How long have you been in England?'</p>
     <p>'A fortnight. I went at once to see my sister, at Malvern; there I fell in with Rudden, the
      man I was with in New Guinea. He was going up to be made an honorary Doctor, and made me come
      with him.'</p>
     <p>'And where are you bound for?' as the train shewed signs of a halt.</p>
     <p>'For London. I meant to hunt up Mat. Fleet, and hear of you, and other old friends.'</p>
     <p>'Does he expect you?'</p>
     <p>'No one expects me. I am a regular vagabond.'</p>
     <p>'Come home with us,' said Dr. May, laying his hand on his arm. 'I cannot part with you so
      soon. Come, find your luggage. Take your ticket for Gloucester.'</p>
     <p>'So suddenly. Will it not be inconvenient?' said he, looking tempted, but irresolute.</p>
     <p>'O no, no; pray come!' said Ethel, eagerly. 'We shall be so glad.'</p>
     <p>He looked his courteous thanks, and soon was with them <hi>en route</hi> for
      Stoneborough.</p>
     <p>Ethel's thoughts were diverted from all she had left at Oxford. She could not but watch
      those two old friends. She knew enough of the traveller to enter into her father's happiness,
      and to have no fears of another Sir Matthew.</p>
     <p>They had been together at Stoneborough, at Cambridge, at Paris, at Edinburgh, always linked
      in the closest friendship; but, by Dr. May's own account, his friend had been the diligent one
      of the pair, a bright compound of principle and spirit, and highly distinguished in all his
      studies, and Dr. May's model of perfection. Their paths had since lain far apart, and they had
      not seen each other, since, twenty-six years ago, they had parted in London—the one to settle
      at his native town, while the other accepted a situation as travelling physician. On his
      return, he had almost sacrificed his life, by self-devoted attendance on a fever-stricken
      emigrant-ship. He had afterwards received an appointment in India, and there the
      correspondence had died away, and Dr. May had lost traces of him, only knowing that, in a
      visitation of cholera, he had again acted with the same carelessness of his own life, and a
      severe illness,
      <pb n="441"/> which had broken up his health, had occasioned him to relinquish his post.</p>
     <p>It now appeared that he had thought himself coming home ever since. He had gone to recruit,
      in the Himalayas, and had become engrossed in scientific observations on their altitudes, as
      well as investigations in natural history. Going to Calcutta, he had fallen in with a party
      about to explore the Asiatic islands, and he had accompanied them, as well as going on an
      expedition into the interior of Australia. He had been employed in various sanitary
      arrangements there, and in India, and had finally worked his way slowly home, overland,
      visiting Egypt and Palestine, and refreshing his memory with every Italian, German, or French
      Cathedral, or work of art, that had delighted him in early days.</p>
     <p>He was a slight, small man, much sun-burnt, nearly bald, and his hair snowy, but his eyes
      were beautiful, very dark, soft, and smiling, and yet their gaze peculiarly keen and steady,
      as if ready for any emergency, and his whole frame was full of alertness and vigour. His voice
      was clear and sweet, and his manner most refined and polished; indeed, his courtesy to Ethel,
      whenever there was a change of carriage, was so exemplary, that she understood it as the
      effect on a chivalrous mind, of living where a lady was a rare and precious article. It
      frightened Ethel a little at first, but, before the end of the journey, she had already begun
      to feel, towards him, like an old friend—one of those inheritances, who are so much valued and
      loved, like a sort of uncles-in-friendship. She had an especial grateful honour for the
      delicate tact which asked no questions, as she saw his eye often falling anxiously on her
      father's left hand, where the wedding ring shone upon the little finger.</p>
     <p>There was talk enough upon his travels, on public changes, and on old friends; but, after
      those first few words, home had never been mentioned.</p>
     <p>When, at five o'clock, the engine blew its whistle, at the old familiar station, Dr. May had
      scarcely put his head out before Adams hastened up to him with a note.</p>
     <p>'All well at home?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, sir. Miss Margaret sent up the gig.'</p>
     <p>'I must go at once,' said Dr. May, hastily—'the Larkins' child is worse. Ethel, take care of
      him, and introduce him. Love to Margaret. I'll be at home before tea.'</p>
     <p>He was driven off at speed, and Ethel proposed to walk home. Dr. Spencer gave her his arm,
      and was silent; but presently said, in a low, anxious voice, 'My dear, you must forgive me, I
      have heard nothing for many years. Your mother—'</p>
     <pb n="442"/>
     <p>'It was an accident,' said Ethel, looking straight before her. 'It was when papa's arm was
      hurt. The carriage was overturned.'</p>
     <p>'And—' repeated Dr. Spencer, earnestly.</p>
     <p>'She was killed on the spot,' said Ethel, speaking shortly, and abruptly. If she was to say
      it at all, she could not do so otherwise.</p>
     <p>He was dreadfully shocked—she knew it by the shudder of his arm, and a tight, suppressed
      groan. He did not speak, and Ethel, as if a relief from the silence must be made, said what
      was not very consoling, and equally blunt, 'Margaret had some harm done to her spine—she
      cannot walk.'</p>
     <p>He did not seem to hear, but walked on, as in a dream, where Ethel guided him, and she would
      not interrupt him again.</p>
     <p>They had just passed Mr. Bramshaw's office, when a voice was heard behind, calling, 'Miss
      Ethel! Miss Ethel!' and Edward Anderson, now articled to Mr. Bramshaw, burst out, pen in hand,
      and looking shabby and inky.</p>
     <p>'Miss Ethel!' he said, breathlessly, 'I beg your pardon, but have you heard from Harry?'</p>
     <p>'No!' said Ethel. 'Have they had that paper at home?'</p>
     <p>'Not that I know of,' said Edward. 'My mother wanted to send it, but I would not take it—not
      while Dr. May was away.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you—that was very kind of you.'</p>
     <p>'And oh! Miss Ethel, do you think it is true?'</p>
     <p>'We hope not,' said Ethel, kindly—'we saw a Captain at Oxford who thought it not at all to
      be depended on.'</p>
     <p>'I am so glad,' said Edward; and, shaking hands, he went back to his high stool, Ethel
      feeling that he deserved the pains that Norman had taken to spare and befriend him. She spoke
      to her companion in explanation. 'We are very anxious for news of my next brother's ship,
      Alcestis, in the Pacific—'</p>
     <p>'More!' exclaimed poor Dr. Spencer, almost overpowered; 'Good Heavens! I thought May, at
      least, was happy!'</p>
     <p>'He is not unhappy,' said Ethel, not sorry that they had arrived at the back entrance of the
      shrubbery.</p>
     <p>'How long ago was this?' said he, standing still, as soon as they had passed into the
      garden.</p>
     <p>'Four years, next October. I assure you, his spirits are almost always good.'</p>
     <p>'When I was at Adelaide, little thinking!' he sighed, then collecting himself. 'Forgive me,
      I have given you pain.'</p>
     <p>'No,' she said, 'or rather, I gave you more.'</p>
     <p>'I knew her—' and there he broke off, paused for a minute, then
      <pb n="443"/> collecting himself, seemed resolutely to turn away from the subject, and said,
      walking on, 'This garden is not much altered.'</p>
     <p>At that moment, a little shrill voice broke out in remonstrance among the laurels—'But you
      know, Daisy, you are the captain of the forty thieves!'</p>
     <p>'A startling anouncement!' said Dr. Spencer, looking at Ethel, and the next two steps
      brought them in view of the play-place in the laurels, where Aubrey lay on the ground,
      feigning sleep, but keeping a watchful eye over Blanche, who was dropping something into the
      holes of inverted flower pots, Gertrude dancing about in a way that seemed to have called for
      the reproof of the more earnest actors.</p>
     <p>'Ethel! Ethel! screamed the children, with one voice, and, while the two girls stood in
      shyness at her companion, Aubrey had made a dart at her neck, and hung upon her, arms, legs,
      body, and all, like a wild cat.'</p>
     <p>'That will do! that will do, old man—let go! Speak to Dr. Spencer, my dear.'</p>
     <p>Blanche did so demurely, and asked where was papa?</p>
     <p>'Coming, as soon as he has been to Mrs. Larkins's poor baby.'</p>
     <p>'George Larkins has been here,' said Aubrey. 'And I have finished <hi>Vipera et lima</hi> ,
      Ethel, but Margaret makes such false quantities!'</p>
     <p>'What is your name, youngster?' said Dr. Spencer, laying his hand on Aubrey's head.</p>
     <p>'Aubrey Spencer May,' was the answer.</p>
     <p>'Hey day! where did you steal my name?' exclaimed Dr. Spencer, while Aubrey stood abashed at
      so mysterious an accusation.</p>
     <p>'Oh!' exclaimed Blanche, seizing on Ethel, and whispering, 'Is it really the boy that
      climbed the market cross?'</p>
     <p>'You see your fame lives here,' said Ethel, smiling, as Dr. Spencer evidently heard.</p>
     <p>'He was a little boy!' said Aubrey, indignantly, looking at the grey-haired man.</p>
     <p>'There!' said Ethel to Dr. Spencer.</p>
     <p>'The tables turned!' he said, laughing heartily. 'But do not let me keep you—You would wish
      to prepare your sister for a stranger, and I shall improve my acquaintance here. Where are the
      forty thieves?'</p>
     <p>'I am all of them,' said the innocent, daisy-faced Gertrude; and Ethel hastened towards the
      house, glad of the permission granted by his true good-breeding.</p>
     <p>There was a shriek of welcome from Mary, who sat working beside Margaret. Ethel was certain
      that no evil tidings had come to her eldest sister, so joyous was her exclamation of wonder
      and
      <pb n="444"/> rebuke to her home-sick Ethel. 'Naughty girl! running home at once! I did think
      you would have been happy there!'</p>
     <p>'So I was,' said Ethel, hastily; 'but who do you think I have brought home?' Margaret
      flushed with such a pink, that Ethel resolved never to set her guessing again, and hurried to
      explain; and having heard that all was well, and taken her housekeeping measures, she
      proceeded to fetch the guest; but Mary, who had been unusually silent all this time, ran after
      her, and checked her.</p>
     <p>'Ethel, have you heard?' she said.</p>
     <p>'Have you?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'George Larkins rode in this morning to see when papa would come home, and he told me. He
      said I had better not tell Margaret, for he did not believe it.'</p>
     <p>'And you have not! That is very good of you, Mary.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! I am glad you are come! I could not have helped telling, if you had been away a whole
      week! But, Ethel, does papa believe it?' Poor Mary's full lip swelled, and her eyes swam,
      ready to laugh of weep, in full faith in her sister's answer.</p>
     <p>Ethel told of Meta's captain, and the smile predominated, and settled down into Mary's usual
      broad beamy look, like a benignant rising sun on the sign of an inn, as Ethel praised her
      warmly for a fortitude and consideration of which she had not thought her capable.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer was discovered full in the midst of the comedy of the forty thieves,
      alternating, as required, between the robber-captain and the ass, and the children in perfect
      ecstacies with him.</p>
     <p>They all followed in his train to the drawing-room, and were so clamorous, that he could
      have no conversation with Margaret. He certainly made them so, but Ethel, remembering what a
      blow her disclosures had been, thought it would be only a kindness to send Aubrey to show him
      to his room, where he might have some peace.</p>
     <p>She was not sorry to be very busy, so as to have little time to reply to the questions on
      the doings at Oxford, and the cause of her sudden return; and yet it would have been a comfort
      to be able to sit down to understand herself, and recall her confused thoughts. But solitary
      reflection was a thing only to be hoped for in that house in bed, and Ethel was obliged to run
      up and down, and attend to everybody, under an undefined sense that she had come home to a
      dull, anxious world of turmoil.</p>
     <p>Margaret seemed to guess nothing, that was one comfort; she evidently thought that her
      return was fully accounted for by the fascination of her papa's presence in a strange place.
      She gave Ethel no credit for the sacrifice, naturally supposing that she could not enjoy
      herself away from home. Ethel did not know whether to be glad or not; she was relieved, but it
      was flat. As to Norman
      <pb n="445"/> Ogilvie, one or two inquiries whether she liked him, and if Norman were going to
      Scotland with him, were all that passed, and it was very provoking to be made so hot and
      conscious by them.</p>
     <p>She could not begin to dress till late, and while she was unpacking, she heard her father
      come home, among the children's loud welcomes, and go to the drawing-room. He presently
      knocked at the door between their rooms.</p>
     <p>'So Margaret does not know?' he said.</p>
     <p>'No, Mary has been so very good;' and she told what had passed.</p>
     <p>'Well done, Mary, I must tell her so. She is a good girl on a pinch, you see!'</p>
     <p>'And we don't speak of it now? Or will it hurt Margaret more to think we keep things from
      her?'</p>
     <p>'That is the worst risk of the two. I have seen great harm done in that way. Mention it, but
      without seeming to make too much of it.'</p>
     <p>'Won't you, papa?'—</p>
     <p>'You had better—It will seem of less importance. I think nothing of it myself—'</p>
     <p>Nevertheless, Ethel saw that he could not trust himself to broach the subject to
      Margaret.</p>
     <p>'How was the Larkins' baby?'</p>
     <p>'Doing better. What have you done with Spencer?'</p>
     <p>'I put him into Richard's room. The children were eating him up! He is so kind to them.'</p>
     <p>'Aye! I say, Ethel, that was a happy consequence of your coming home with me.'</p>
     <p>'What a delightful person he is!'</p>
     <p>'Is he not? A true knight errant, as he always was! I could not tell you what I owed to him
      as a boy—all my life, I may say— Ethel,' he added, suddenly; 'we must do our best to make him
      happy here. I know it now—I never guessed it <hi>then</hi> , but one is very hard and selfish
      when one is happy—'</p>
     <p>'What do you mean, papa?'</p>
     <p>I see it now,' continued Dr. May, incoherently; 'the cause of his wandering life—advantages
      thrown aside. He! the most worthy. Things I little heeded at the time have come back on me! I
      understand why he banished himself!'</p>
     <p>'Why?' asked Ethel, bewildered.</p>
     <p>'She never had an idea of it; but I might have guessed from what fell from him
      unconsciously, for not a word would he have said —nor did he say, to show how he sacrificed
      himself!'</p>
     <p>'Who was it? Aunt Flora?' said Ethel, beginning to collect his meaning.</p>
     <pb n="446"/>
     <p>'No, Ethel, it was your own dear mother! You will think this another romantic fancy of mine,
      but I am sure of it.'</p>
     <p>'So am I,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'How—what? Ah! I remembered, after we parted, that he might know nothing—'</p>
     <p>'He asked me,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And how did he bear it?'</p>
     <p>Ethel told, and the tears filled her father's eyes. 'It was wrong and cruel in me to bring
      him home unprepared! and then to leave it to you. I always forget other people's feelings.
      Poor Spencer! And now, Ethel, you see what manner of man we have here, and how we ought to
      treat him.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed I do!'</p>
     <p>'The most unselfish—the most self-sacrificing—' continued Dr. May. 'And to see what it all
      turned on! I happened to have this place open to me—the very cause, perhaps, of my having
      taken things easy—and so the old Professor threw opportunities in my way; while Aubrey
      Spencer, with every recommendation that man could have, was set aside, and exiled himself,
      leaving the station, and all he might so easily have gained. Ah, Ethel, Sir Matthew Fleet
      never came near him in ability. But not one word to interfere with me, would he say, and—how I
      have longed to meet him again, after parting in my selfish, unfeeling gladness; and now I have
      nothing to do for him, but shew him how little I was to be trusted with her.'</p>
     <p>Ethel never knew how to deal with these occasional bursts of grief, but she said that she
      thought Dr. Spencer was very much pleased to have met with him, and delighted with the
      children.</p>
     <p>'Ah! well, you are <hi>her</hi> children,' said Dr. May, with his hand on Ethel's
      shoulder.</p>
     <p>So they went down-stairs, and found Mary making tea; and Margaret, fearing Dr. Spencer was
      overwhelmed with his young admirers—for Aubrey and Gertrude were one on each knee, and Blanche
      standing beside him, inflicting on him a catalogue of the names and ages of all the
      eleven.</p>
     <p>'Ethel has introduced you, I see,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Aye, I assure you, it was an alarming introduction. No sooner do I enter your garden, than
      I hear that I am in the midst of the Forty Thieves. I find a young lady putting the world to
      death, after the fashion of Hamlet—and, looking about to find what I have lost, I find this
      urchin has robbed me of my name—a property I supposed was always left to unfortunate
      travellers, however small they might be chopped themselves.'</p>
     <pb n="447"/>
     <p>'Well, Aubrey boy, will you make restitution?'</p>
     <p>'It is my name,' said Aubrey, positively; for, as his father added, 'He is not without dread
      of the threat being fulfilled, and himself left to be that Anon, who, Blanche says, writes so
      much poetry.'</p>
     <p>Aubrey privately went to Ethel, to ask her if this were possible; and she had to reassure
      him, by telling him that they were 'only in fun.'</p>
     <p>It was fun with a much deeper current though; for Dr. Spencer was saying, with a smile,
      between gratification and sadness, 'I did not think my name would have been remembered here so
      long.'</p>
     <p>'We had used up mine, and the grandfathers', and the uncles', and began to think we might
      look a little further a-field,' said Dr. May. 'If I had only known where you were, I would
      have asked you to be the varlet's godfather; but I was much afraid you were no where in the
      land of the living.'</p>
     <p>'I have but one godson, and he is coffee-coloured! I ought to have written; but, you see,
      for seven years I thought I was coming home.'</p>
     <p>Aubrey had recovered sufficiently to observe to Blanche, 'that was almost as bad as
      Ulysses,' which, being overheard and repeated, led to the information that he was Ethel's
      pupil, whereupon Dr. Spencer began to inquire after the school, and to exclaim at his friend
      for having deserted it in the person of Tom. Dr. May looked convicted, but said it was all
      Norman's fault; and Dr. Spencer, shaking his head at Blanche, opined that the young gentleman
      was a great innovater, and that he was sure he was at the bottom of the pulling down the
      Market Cross, and the stopping up Randall's Alley— iniquities of the "nasty people," of which
      she already had made him aware.</p>
     <p>'Poor Norman, he suffered enough anent Randall's Alley,' said Dr. May; 'but as to the Market
      Cross, that came down a year before he was born.'</p>
     <p>'It was the Town Council!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'One of the ordinary stultifications of Town Councils?'—</p>
     <p>'Take care, Spencer,' said Dr. May. 'I am a Town Council man myself—'</p>
     <p>'You, Dick!' and he turned with a start of astonishment, and went into a fit of laughing,
      re-echoed by all the young ones, who were especially tickled by hearing, from another, the
      abreviation that had, hitherto, only lived in the favourite expletive, 'As sure as my name is
      Dick May.'</p>
     <p>'Of course,' said Dr. May. "'Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?
      One that hath two gowns, and everything handsome about him!'"</p>
     <pb n="448"/>
     <p>His friend laughed the more, and they betook themselves to the College stories, of which the
      quotation from Dogberry seemed to have reminded them.</p>
     <p>There was something curious and affecting in their manner to each other. Often it was the
      easy bantering familiarity of the two youths they had once been together, with somewhat of
      elder brotherhood on Dr. Spencer's side—and of looking up on Dr. May's—and just as they had
      recurred to these terms, some allusion would bring back to Dr. Spencer, that the heedless,
      highs-pirited "Dick," whom he had always had much ado to keep out of scrapes, was a
      householder, a man of weight and influence; a light which would at first strike him as most
      ludicrous, and then mirth would end in a sigh, for there was yet another aspect! After having
      thought of him so long as the happy husband of Margaret Mackenzie, he found her place vacant,
      and the trace of deep grief apparent on the countenance, once so gay—the oppression of anxiety
      marked on the brow, formerly so joyous, the merriment almost more touching than gravity would
      have been, for the former nature seemed rather shattered than altered. In merging towards this
      side, there was a tender respect in Dr. Spencer's manner that was most beautiful, though this
      evening such subjects were scrupulously kept at the utmost distance, by the constant
      interchange of new and old jokes and stories.</p>
     <p>Only when bed-time had come, and Margaret had been carried off—did a silence fall on the two
      friends, unbroken till Dr. May rose and proposed going up-stairs. When he gave his hand to
      wish good night, Dr. Spencer held it this time most carefully, and said, 'Oh May! I did not
      expect this!'</p>
     <p>'I should have prepared you,' said his host, 'but I never recollected that you knew
      nothing—'</p>
     <p>'I had dwelt on your happiness!'</p>
     <p>'There never were two happier creatures for twenty-two years,' said Dr. May, his voice low
      with emotion. 'Sorrow spared her! Yes, think of her always in undimmed brightness—always
      smiling as you remember her—She was happy. She is,' he concluded. His friend had turned aside
      and hidden his face with his hand, then looked up for a moment, 'And you, Dick,' he said
      briefly.</p>
     <p>'Sorrow spared her,' was Dr. May's first answer. 'And hers are very good children!'</p>
     <p>There was a silence again, ending in Dr. May's saying, 'What do you think of my poor
      girl?'</p>
     <p>They discussed the nature of the injury: Dr. Spencer could not feel otherwise than that it
      was a very hopeless matter. Her father owned that he had thought so from the first, and had
      wondered at
      <pb n="449"/> Sir Matthew Fleet's opinion. His subdued tone of patience and resignation,
      struck his guest above all, as changed from what he had once been.</p>
     <p>'You have been sorely tried,' he said, when they parted at his room door.'</p>
     <p>'I have received much good!' simply answered Dr. May. 'Good night! I am glad to have you
      here—if you can bear it.'</p>
     <p>'Bear it? Dick! how like that girl is to you! She is yourself!'</p>
     <p>'Such a self as I never was! Good-night.'</p>
     <p>Ethel overcame the difficulty of giving the account of the newspaper alarm, with tolerable
      success, by putting the story of Meta's conversation foremost. Margaret did not take it to
      heart as much as she had feared, nor did she appear to dwell on it afterwards. The truth was
      perhaps that Dr. Spencer's visit was to everyone more of an excitement and amusement than it
      was to Ethel. Not that she did not like him extremely, but after such a week as she had been
      spending, the home-world seemed rather stale and unprofitable.</p>
     <p>Miss Bracy relapsed into a state of "feelings," imagining perhaps that Ethel had distrusted
      her capabilities, and therefore returned; or as Ethel herself sometimes feared, there might be
      an irritability in her own manner that gave cause of annoyance. The children were inclined to
      be riotous with their new friend, who made much of them continually, and especially patronized
      Aubrey; Mary was proud of shewing how much she had learnt to do for Margaret in her sister's
      absence; Dr. May was so much taken up with his friend, that Ethel saw less of him than usual,
      and she began to believe that it had been all a mistake that everyone was so dependant on her,
      for, in fact, they did much better without her.</p>
     <p>Meantime, she heard of the gaieties which the others were enjoying, and she could not feel
      heroic when they regretted her. At the end of a week, Meta Rivers was escorted home from
      Warwick by two servants, and came to Stoneborough, giving a lively description of all the
      concluding pleasures, but declaring that Ethel's departure had taken away the zest of the
      whole, and Mr. Ogilvie had been very disconsolate. Margaret had not been prepared to hear that
      Mr. Ogilvie had been so constant a companion, and was struck by finding that Ethel had passed
      over one who had evidently been so great an ingredient in the delights of the expedition. Meta
      had, however, observed nothing—she was a great deal too simple and too much engrossed for such
      notions to have crossed her mind; but Margaret inferred something, and hoped to learn more
      when she should see Flora. This would not be immediately. George and his wife were gone to
      London, and thence intended to pay a round of visits; and Norman had accompanied his namesake
      to Glenbracken.</p>
     <pb n="450"/>
     <p>Ethel fought hard with her own petulance and sense of tedium at home, which was, as she
      felt, particularly uncalled for at present; when Dr. Spencer was enlivening them so much. He
      was never in the way, he was always either busy in the dining room in the morning with books
      and papers, or wandering about his old school-boy haunts in the town, or taking Adams' place,
      and driving out Dr. May, or sometimes joining the children in a walk, to their supreme
      delight. His sketches, for he drew most beautifully, were an endless pleasure to Margaret,
      with his explanations of them—she even tried to sit up to copy them, and he began to teach
      Blanche to draw. The evenings, when there was certain to be some entertaining talk going on
      between the two Doctors, were very charming, and Margaret seemed quite revived by seeing her
      father so happy with his friend. Ethel knew she ought to be happy also, and if attention could
      make her so, she had it, for kind and courteous as Dr. Spencer was to all, she seemed to have
      a double charm for him. It was as if he found united in her the quaint <hi>brusquerie</hi> ,
      that he had loved in her father, with somewhat of her mother; for though Ethel had less
      personal resemblance to Mrs. May than any other of the family, Dr. Spencer transferred to her
      much of the chivalrous distant devotion, with which he had regarded her mother. Ethel was very
      little conscious of it, but he was certainly her sworn knight, and there was an eagerness in
      his manner of performing every little service for her, a deference in his way of listening to
      her, over and above his ordinary polish of manner.</p>
     <p>Ethel lighted up, and enjoyed herself when talking was going on— her periods of
       <hi>ennui</hi> were when she had to set about any home employment—when Aubrey's lessons did
      not go well—when she wanted to speak to her father, and could not catch him; and even when she
      had to go to Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>She did not seem to make any progress there—the room was very full, and very close, the
      children were dull, and she began to believe she was doing no good—it was all a weariness. But
      she was so heartily ashamed of her feelings, that she worked the more vehemently for them, and
      the utmost shew that they outwardly made was, that Margaret thought her less vivacious than
      her wont, and she was a little too peremptory at times with Mary and Blanche. She had so much
      disliked the display that Flora had made about Cocksmoor, that she had imposed total silence
      on it upon her younger sisters, and Dr. Spencer had spent a fortnight at Stoneborough without
      being aware of their occupation; when there occurred such an extremely sultry day, that
      Margaret remonstrated with Ethel on her intention of broiling herself and Mary by walking to
      Cocksmoor, when the quicksilver stood at 80° in the shade.</p>
     <pb n="451"/>
     <p>Ethel was much inclined to stay at home, but she did not know whether this was from heat or
      from idleness, and her fretted spirits took the turn of determination—so she posted off at a
      gallopping pace, that her brothers called her 'Cocksmoor speed,' and Mary panted by her side,
      humbly petitioning for the plantation path, when she answered 'that it was as well to be hot
      in the sun as in the shade.'</p>
     <p>The school-room was unusually full, all the haymaking mothers made it serve as an infant
      school, and though as much window was opened as there could be, the effect was not coolness.
      Nevertheless, Ethel sat down and gathered her class round her, and she had just heard the
      chapter once read, when there was a little confusion, a frightened cry of "Ethel!" and before
      she could rise to her feet—a flump upon the floor—poor Mary had absolutely fainted dead
      away.</p>
     <p>Ethel was much terrified, and very angry with herself; Mary was no light weight, but Mrs.
      Elwood coming at their cry, helped Ethel to drag her into the outer room, where she soon began
      to recover, and to be excessively puzzled as to what had happened to her. She said the sea was
      roaring, and where was Harry? and then she looked much surprised to find herself lying on Mrs.
      Elwood's damp flags— a circumstance extremely distressing to Mrs. Elwood, who wanted to carry
      her up-stairs into Cherry's room, very clean and very white, but with such a sun shining full
      into it!</p>
     <p>Ethel lavished all care, and reproached herself greatly, though to be sure nothing had ever
      been supposed capable of hurting Mary, and Mary herself protested that nothing at all had
      ailed her till the children's voices began to sound funny, and turned into the waves of the
      sea, and therewith poor Mary burst into a great flood of tears, and asked whether Harry would
      ever come back. The tears did her a great deal of good, though not so much as the being petted
      by Ethel, and she soon declared herself perfectly well; but Ethel could not think of letting
      her walk home, and sent off a boy—who she trusted would not faint—with a note to Margaret,
      desiring her to send the gig, which fortunately was at home to-day.</p>
     <p>Mary had partaken of some of Mrs. Elwood's tea, which, though extremely bitter, seemed a
      great cordial, and was sitting, quite revived, in the arbour at the door, when the gig
      stopped, and Dr. Spencer walked in.</p>
     <p>'Well, and how are you?'</p>
     <p>'Quite well now, thank you. Was Margaret frightened? Why did you come?'</p>
     <p>'I thought it would make her happier, as your father was not at home. Here, let me feel your
      pulse. Do you think no one is a doctor but your papa? There's not much the matter with you,
      however. Where is Ethel?'</p>
     <pb n="452"/>
     <p>'In the school,' and Mary opened the door. Dr. Spencer looked in, as Ethel came out, and his
      face put her in mind of Norman's look.</p>
     <p>'No wonder!' was all he said.</p>
     <p>Ethel was soon satisfied that he did not think Mary ill. In fact, he said fainting was the
      most natural and justifiable measure, under the circumstances. 'How many human creatures do
      you keep there?' he asked.</p>
     <p>'Forty-seven to-day,' said Mary, proudly.</p>
     <p>'I shall indict you for cruelty to animals! I think I have known it hotter at Poonshedagore,
      but there we had punkahs!'</p>
     <p>'It was very wrong of me,' said Ethel. 'I should have thought of poor Mary, in that sunny
      walk, but Mary never complains.'</p>
     <p>'Oh, never mind,' said Mary, 'it did not hurt.'</p>
     <p>'I'm not thinking of Mary,' said Dr. Spencer, 'but of the wretched beings you are leaving
      shut up there. I wonder what the mercury would be there.'</p>
     <p>'We cannot help it,' said Mary. 'We cannot get the ground.'</p>
     <p>And Mary having been voted into the seat of honour and comfort, by his side, in the
      carriage, told her version of Cocksmoor and the Committee; while Ethel sat up in the little
      narrow seat behind, severely reproaching herself for her want of consideration towards one so
      good and patient as Mary, who proved to have been suffering far more on Harry's account than
      they had guessed, and who was so simple and thoroughgoing in doing her duty. This was not
      being a good elder sister, and, when they came home, she confessed it, and shewed so much
      remorse, that poor Mary was quite shocked, and cried so bitterly, that it was necessary to
      quit the subject.</p>
     <p>'Ethel, dearest,' said Margaret, that night, after they were in bed, 'is there anything the
      matter?'</p>
     <p>'No, nothing, but that Oxford has spoilt me,' said Ethel, resolutely. 'I am very cross and
      selfish!'</p>
     <p>'It will be better by-and-by,' said Margaret, 'if only you are sure you have nothing to make
      you unhappy.'</p>
     <p>'Nothing,' said Ethel. She was becoming too much ashamed of her fancy to breathe one word
      about it, and she had spoken the truth. Pleasure <hi>had</hi> spoilt her.</p>
     <p>'If only we could do something for Cocksmoor!' she sighed, presently, 'with that one hundred
      and fifty pounds lying idle.'</p>
     <p>Margaret was very glad that her thoughts were taking this channel, but it was not a
      promising one, for there seemed to be nothing practicable, present or future. The ground could
      not be had—the pig would not get over the stile—the old woman could not get home to-night.
      Cocksmoor must put up with its present school, and Mary must not be walked to death.</p>
     <pb n="453"/>
     <p>Or, as Ethel drew her own moral, sacrifice must not be selfish. One great resolution that
      has been costly, must not blunt us in the daily details of life.</p>

     <p><hi>Merchant of Venice.</hi></p>
     <p><hi>'Dick</hi> ,' said Dr. Spencer, as the friends sat together in the evening, after
      Mary's swoon, 'you seem to have found an expedient for making havoc among your daughters.'</p>
     <p>'It does not hurt them,' said Dr. May, carelessly.</p>
     <p>'Pretty well, after the specimen of to-day.'</p>
     <p>'That was chance.'</p>
     <p>'If you like it, I have no more to say; but I should like to make you sit for two hours in
      such a temperature. If they were mine—'</p>
     <p>'Very fine talking, but I would not take the responsibility of hindering the only pains that
      have ever been taken with that unlucky place. You don't know that girl Ethel. She began at
      fifteen, entirely of her own accord, and has never faltered. If any of the children there are
      saved from perdition, it is owing to her, and I am not going to be the man to stop her. They
      are strong, healthy girls, and I cannot see that it does them any harm—rather good.'</p>
     <p>'Have you any special predilection for a room eight feet by nine?'</p>
     <p>'Can't be helped. What would you have said if you had seen the last?'</p>
     <p>'What is this about one hundred and fifty pounds in hand?'</p>
     <p>'The ladies here chose to have a fancy fair, the only result of which, hitherto, has been
      the taking away my Flora. There is the money, but the land can't be had.'</p>
     <p>'Why not?'</p>
     <p>'Tied up between the Drydale Estate and—College, and in the hands of the quarry master,
      Nicolson. There was an application made to the College, but they did not begin at the right
      end.'</p>
     <p>'Upon my word, Dick, you take it easy!' cried his friend, rather in dignantly.</p>
     <pb n="454"/>
     <p>'I own I have not stirred in the matter,' said Dr. May. 'I knew nothing would come to good
      under the pack of silly women that our schools are ridden with—' and, as he heard a sound a
      little like 'pish!' he continued, 'and that old Ramsden, it is absolutely useless to work with
      such a head—or no head. There's nothing for it, but to wait for better times, instead of
      setting up independant, insubordinate action.'</p>
     <p>'You are the man to leave venerable abuses undisturbed!'</p>
     <p>'The cure is worse than the disease!'</p>
     <p>'There spoke the Corporation!'</p>
     <p>'Ah! it was not the way you set to work in Poonshedagore.'</p>
     <p>'Why, really, when the venerable abuses consisted of Hindoos praying to their own
      three-legged stools, and keeping sacred monkeys in honour of the ape Hanyuman, it was a
      question whether one could be a Christian oneself, and suffer it undisturbed. It was coming it
      too strong, when I was requested to lend my own step-ladder for the convenience of an
      exhibition of a devotee, swinging on hooks in in his sides.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer had, in fact, never rested till he had established a mission in his former
      remote station; and his brown godson, once a Brahmin, now an exemplary Clergyman, traced his
      conversion to the friendship, and example, of the English physician.</p>
     <p>'Well, I have lashed about me at abuses, in my time,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I dare say you have, Dick!' and they both laughed—the inconsiderate way was so well
      delineated.</p>
     <p>'Just <hi>so</hi> ,' replied Dr. May; 'and I made enemies enough to fetter me now. I do not
      mean that I have done right—I have not; but there is a good deal on my hands, and I don't
      write easily. I have been slower to take up new matters than I ought to have been.'</p>
     <p>'I see, I see!' said Dr. Spencer, rather sorry for his implied reproach, 'but must Cocksmoor
      be left to its fate, and your gallant daughter to hers?'</p>
     <p>'The Vicar won't stir. He is indolent enough by nature, and worse with gout; and I do not
      see what good I could do. I once offended the tenant, Nicolson, by fining him, for cheating
      his unhappy labourers, on the abominable truck system; and he had rather poison me, than do
      anything to oblige me. And, as to the copyholder, he is a fine gentleman, who never comes near
      the place, nor does anything for it.'</p>
     <p>'Who is he?'</p>
     <p>'Sir Henry Walkinghame.'</p>
     <p>'Sir Henry Walkinghame! I know the man. I found him in one of the caves at Thebes, among the
      mummies, laid up with a
      <pb n="455"/> fever, nearly ready to be a mummy himself! I remember bleeding him—irregular,
      was not it? but one does not stand on ceremony in Pharaoh's tomb. I got him through with it;
      we came up the Nile together, and the last I saw of him was at Alexandria. He is your man!
      something might be done with him!</p>
     <p>'I believe Flora promises to ask him if she should ever meet him in London, but he is always
      away. If ever we should be happy enough to get an active incumbent, we shall have a
      chance.'</p>
     <p>Two days after, Ethel came down equipped for Cocksmoor. It was as hot as ever, and Mary was
      ordered to stay at home, being somewhat pacified by a promise that she should go again as soon
      as the weather was fit for anything but a salamander.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer was in the hall, with his bamboo, his great Panama hat, and grey loose coat, for
      he entirely avoided, except on Sundays, the medical suit of black. He offered to relieve Ethel
      of her bag of books.</p>
     <p>'No thank you.' (He had them by this time). 'But I am going to Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'Will you allow me to be your companion?'</p>
     <p>'I shall be very glad of the pleasure of your company, but I am not in the least afraid of
      going alone,' said she, smiling, however, so as to shew she was glad of such pleasant company.
      'I forewarn you though that I have business there.'</p>
     <p>'I will find occupation.'</p>
     <p>'And you must promise not to turn against me. I have undergone a great deal already about
      that place. Norman was always preaching against it, and now that he has become reasonable, I
      can't have papa set against it again—besides, he would mind you more.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer promised to do nothing but what was quite reasonable. Ethel believed that he
      accompanied her merely because his gallantry would not suffer her to go unescorted, and she
      was not sorry, for it was too long a walk for solitude to be very agreeable, when strange
      waggoners might be on the road, though she had never let them be "lions in the path."</p>
     <p>The walk was as pleasant as a scorching sun would allow, and by the time they arrived at the
      scattered cottages, Ethel had been drawn into explaining many of her Cocksmoor
      perplexities.</p>
     <p>'If you could get the land granted, where should you choose to have it?' he asked. 'You know
      it will not do to go and say, "Be pleased to give me a piece of land," without specifying
      what, or you might chance to have one at the Land's End.'</p>
     <p>'I see, that was one of the blunders,' said Ethel. 'But I had often thought of this nice
      little square place, between two gardens, and sheltered by the old quarry.'</p>
     <pb n="456"/>
     <p>'Ha! hardly space enough, I should say,' replied Dr. Spencer, stepping it out. 'No, that
      won't do, so confined by the quarry. Let us look further.'</p>
     <p>A surmise crossed Ethel. Could he be going to take the work on himself, but that was too
      wild a supposition—she knew he had nothing of his own, only a moderate pension from the East
      India Company.</p>
     <p>'What do you think of this?' he said, coming to the slope of a knoll, commanding a pretty
      view of the Abbotstoke woods, clear from houses, and yet not remote from the hamlet. She
      agreed that it would do well, and he kicked up a bit of turf, and pryed into the soil,
      pronouncing it dry, and fit for a good foundation. Then he began to step it out, making a
      circuit that amazed her, but he said, 'It is of no use to do it at twice. Your school can be
      only the first step towards a Church, and you had better have room enough at once. It will
      serve as an endowment in the meantime.'</p>
     <p>He would not let her remain in the sun, and she went into school. She found him, when she
      came out, sitting in the arbour, smoking a cigar—rather a shock to her feelings, though he
      threw it away the instant she appeared, and she excused him for his foreign habits.</p>
     <p>In the evening, he brought down a traveller's case of instruments, and proceeded to draw a
      beautiful little map of Cocksmoor, where it seemed that he had taken all his measurements,
      whilst she was in school. He ended by an imaginary plan and elevation for the school, with a
      pretty oriel window and bell-gable, that made Ethel sigh with delight at the bare idea.</p>
     <p>Next day, he vanished after dinner, but this he often did; he used to say he must go and
      have a holiday of smoking—he could not bear too much civilized society. He came back for tea,
      however, and had not sat down long before he said, 'Now, I know all about it. I shall pack up
      my goods, and be off for Vienna to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'To Vienna!' was the general and dolorous outcry, and Gertrude laid hold of him and said he
      should not go.</p>
     <p>'I am coming back,' he said, 'if you will have me. The College holds a Court at Fordholm, on
      the 3rd, and, on the last of this month, I hope to return.'</p>
     <p>'College! Court! What are you going to do at Vienna? Where have you left your senses?' asked
      Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I find Sir Henry Walkinghame is there. I have been on an exploring expedition to Drydale,
      found out his man of business, and where he is to be written to. The College holds a Court at
      Fordholm, and I hope to have our business settled.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was too much confounded to speak. Her father was exclaiming on the shortness of the
      time.</p>
     <pb n="457"/>
     <p>'Plenty of time,' said Dr. Spencer, demonstrating that he should be able to travel
      comfortably, and have four days to spare at Vienna— a journey, which he seemed to think less
      of, than did Dr. May of going to London.</p>
     <p>As to checking him, of that there was no possibility, nor, indeed, notion, though Ethel did
      not quite know how to believe in it, nor that the plan could come to good. Ethel was much
      better by this time: by her vigorous efforts, she had recovered her tone of mind and interest
      in what was passing; and though, now and then Norman's letters, carrying sentences of
      remembrance, made her glow a little, she was so steady to her resolution that she averted all
      traffic in messages through her brother's correspondence, and, in that fear, allowed it to
      lapse into Margaret's hands more than she had ever done. Indeed, no one greatly liked writing
      from home, it was heartless work to say always, 'No news from the Alcestis,' and yet they all
      declared they were not anxious.</p>
     <p>Hector Ernescliffe knelt a great while beside Margaret's sofa, on the first evening of his
      holidays, and there was a long low-voiced talk between them. Ethel wished that she had warned
      him off, for Margaret looked much more harassed and anxious, after having heard the outpouring
      of all that was on his mind.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer thought her looking worse, when he came, as come he did, on the appointed day.
      He had brought Sir Henry Walkinghame's full consent to the surrender of the land; drawn up in
      such form as could be acted upon, and a letter to his man of business. But Nicolson! He was a
      worse dragon nearer home, hating all schools, especially hating Dr. May.</p>
     <p>However, said Dr. Spencer, in eastern form, 'Have I encountered Rajahs, and smoked pipes
      with three-tailed Pachas, that I should dread the face of the father of quarrymen.'</p>
     <p>What he did with the father of quarrymen was not known, whether he talked him over, or
      bought him off—Margaret hoped the former; Dr. May feared the latter; the results were certain;
      Mr. Nicolson had agreed that the land should be given up.</p>
     <p>The triumphant Dr. Spencer sat down to write a statement to be shewn to the College
      authorities, when they should come to hold their court.</p>
     <p>'The land must be put into the hands of trustees,' he said, 'The incumbent of course?'</p>
     <p>'Then yourself; and we must have another. Your son-in-law?'</p>
     <p>'You, I should think,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I! Why, I am going.'</p>
     <p>'Going, but not gone,' said his friend.</p>
     <pb n="458"/>
     <p>'I must go! I tell you, Dick; I must have a place of my own to smoke my pipe in.'</p>
     <p>'Is that all?' said Dr. May. 'I think you might be accommodated here, unless you wished to
      be near your sister.'</p>
     <p>'My sister is always resorting to watering-places. My nieces do nothing but play on the
      piano. No, I shall perhaps go off to America, the only place I have not seen yet, and I more
      than half engaged to go and help at Poonshedagore.'</p>
     <p>'Better order your coffin then,' muttered Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I shall try lodgings in London, near the old Hospital, perhaps— and go and turn over the
      British Museum library.'</p>
     <p>'Look you here, Spencer, I have a much better plan. Do you know that scrap of a house of
      mine, by the back gate, just big enough for you and your pipe? Set up your staff there. Ethel
      will never get her school built without you.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! that would be capital!' cried Ethel.</p>
     <p>'It would be the best speculation for me. You would pay rent, and the last old woman never
      did,' continued Dr. May. 'A garden the length of this one—'</p>
     <p>'But I say—I want to be near the British Museum.'</p>
     <p>'Take a season-ticket, and run up once a week.'</p>
     <p>'I shall teach your boys to smoke!'</p>
     <p>'I'll see to that!'</p>
     <p>'You have given Cocksmoor one lift,' said Ethel, 'and it will never go on without you.'</p>
     <p>'It is such a nice house!' added the children, in chorus; 'it would be such fun to have you
      there.'</p>
     <p>'Daisy will never be able to spare her other Doctor,' said Margaret, smiling.</p>
     <p>'Run to Mrs. Adams, Tom, and get the key,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>There was a putting on of hats and bonnets, and the whole party walked down the garden to
      inspect the house—a matter of curiosity to some—for it was where the old lady had resided on
      whom Harry had played so many tricks, and the subject of many myths hatched between him and
      George Larkins.</p>
     <p>It was an odd, little narrow slip of a house, four stories, of two rooms all the way up,
      each with a large window, with a marked white eye-brow. Dr. May eagerly pointed out all the
      conveniences, parlour, museum, smoking den, while Dr. Spencer listened, and answered
      doubtfully; and the children's clamorous anxiety seemed to render him the more silent.</p>
     <p>Hector Ernescliffe discovered a jack-daw's nest in the chimney, whereupon the whole train
      rushed off to investigate, leaving the two
      <pb n="459"/> Doctors and Ethel standing together in the empty parlour, Dr. May pressing, Dr.
      Spencer raising desultory objections; but so evidently against his own wishes, that Ethel
      said, 'Now, indeed, you must not disappoint us all.'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Dr. May, 'it is a settled thing.'</p>
     <p>'No, no, thanks, thanks to you all, but it cannot be. Let me go—' and he spoke with emotion.
      'You are very kind, but it is not to be thought of.'</p>
     <p>'Why not?' said Dr. May. 'Spencer, stay with me—' and he spoke with a pleading, almost
      dependant air, 'Why should you go?'</p>
     <p>'It is of no use to talk about it. You are very kind, but it will not do to encumber you
      with a lone man, growing old.'</p>
     <p>'We have been young together,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'And you must not leave papa,' added Ethel.</p>
     <p>'No,' said Dr. May. Trouble may be at hand. Help us through with it. Remember, these
      children have no uncles.'</p>
     <p>'You will stay?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>He made a sign of assent—he could do no more, and, just then, Gertrude came trotting back,
      so exceedingly smutty, as to call everyone's attention. Hector had been shoving Tom half-way
      up the chimney, in hopes of reaching the nest; and the consequences of this amateur
      chimney-sweeping had been a plentiful bespattering of all the spectators with soot, that so
      greatly distressed the young ladies, that Mary and Blanche had fled away from public view.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer's first act of possession was, to threaten to pull Tom down by the heels, for
      disturbing <hi>his</hi> jackdaws, whereupon there was a general acclamation; and Dr. May began
      to talk of marauding times, when the jackdaws in the Minster tower had been harried</p>
     <p>'Ah!' said Dr. Spencer, as Tom emerged, blacker than the outraged jackdaws, and half choked,
      'what do you know about jackdaws' nests? You that are no Whichcote scholars.'</p>
     <p>'Don't we?' cried Hector, 'when there is a jackdaw's nest in Eton Chapel, twenty feet
      high.'</p>
     <p>'Old Grey made that!' said Tom, who usually acted the part of <hi>esprit fort</hi> to
      Hector's credulity.</p>
     <p>'Why, there is a picture of it in Jesse's book,' said Hector.</p>
     <p>'But may not we get up on the roof, to see if we can get at the nest, papa?' said Tom.</p>
     <p>'You must ask Dr. Spencer. It is his house.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer did not gainsay it, and proceeded even to shew the old Whichcote spirit, by
      leading the assault, and promising to take care of Aubrey, while Ethel retained Gertrude, and
      her father too; for Dr. May had such a great inclination to scramble up the ladder after them,
      that she, thinking it a dangerous experiment for so
      <pb n="460"/> helpless an arm, was obliged to assure him that it would create a sensation
      among the gossiphood of Stoneborough, if their physician were seen disporting himself on the
      top of the house.</p>
     <p>'Ah! I'm not a physician unattached, like him,' said Dr. May, laughing. 'Hollo! have you got
      up, Tom? There's a door up there. I'll show you—'</p>
     <p>'No, don't papa. Think of Mrs. Ledwich; and asking her to see two trustees up there!' said
      Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Ah! Mrs. Ledwich; what is to be done with her, Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'I am sure I can't tell. If Flora were but at home, she would manage it.'</p>
     <p>'Spencer can manage anything!' was the answer. 'That was the happiest chance imaginable that
      you came home with me, and so we came to go by the same train.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was only afraid that time was being cruelly wasted; but the best men, and it is
      emphatically the best that generally are so— have the boy strong enough, on one side or other
      of their natures, to be a great provocation to womankind; and Dr. Spencer did not rest from
      his pursuit till the brood of the jackdaws had been discovered, and two grey-headed nestlings
      kidnapped, which were destined to a wicker cage, and education. Little Aubrey was beyond
      measure proud, and was suggesting all sorts of outrageous classical names for them, till
      politely told by Tom that he would make them as great prigs as himself, and that their names
      should be nothing but Jack and Jill.</p>
     <p>'There's nothing for it but for Aubrey to go to school,' cried Tom, sententiously turning
      round to Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Aye, to Stoneborough,' said Dr. Spencer.</p>
     <p>Tom coloured, as if sorry for his movement, and hastened away to make himself sufficiently
      clean to go in quest of a prison for his captives.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer began to bethink him of the paper that he had been so eagerly drawing up, and
      looking at his own begrimed hands, asked Ethel whether she would have him for a trustee.</p>
     <p>'Will the other eight ladies?' said Ethel, 'that's the point.'</p>
     <p>'Ha, Spencer! you did not know what you were undertaking. Do you wish to be let off?' said
      Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'Not I,' said the undaunted Doctor. 'Come, Ethel, let us hear what should be done.'</p>
     <p>'There's no time,' said Ethel, bewildered. 'The Court will be only on the day after
      to-morrow."</p>
     <p>'Ample time!' said Dr. Spencer, who seemed ready to throw himself into it with all his
      might. 'What we have to do is this. The ladies to be propitiated are—'</p>
     <pb n="461"/>
     <p>'Nine Muses, to whom you will have to act Apollo,' said Dr. May, who, having put his friend
      into the situation, had a mischievous delight in laughing at him, and watching what he would
      do.</p>
     <p>'One and two, Ethel, and Mrs. Rivers!'</p>
     <p>'Rather eight and nine,' said Ethel, 'though Flora may be somebody now.'</p>
     <p>'Seven then,' said Dr. Spencer. 'Well then, Ethel, suppose we set out on our travels this
      afternoon. Visit these ladies, get them to call a meeting to-morrow, and sanction their three
      trustees.'</p>
     <p>'You little know what a work it is to call a meeting, or how many notes Miss Rich sends out
      before one can be accomplished.'</p>
     <p>'Faint heart—you know the proverb, Ethel, <hi>Allons</hi> . I'll call on Mrs. Ledwich—'</p>
     <p>'Stay,' said Dr. May. 'Let Ethel do that, and ask her to tea, and we will shew her your
      drawing of the school.'</p>
     <p>So the remaining ladies were divided—Ethel was to visit Miss Anderson, Miss Boulder, and
      Mrs. Ledwich; Dr. Spencer, the rest, and a meeting, if possible, be appointed for the next
      day.</p>
     <p>Ethel did as she was told, though rather against the grain, and her short, abrupt manner,
      was excused the more readily, that Dr. Spencer had been a subject of much mysterious
      speculation in Stoneborough, and to gain any intelligence respecting him, was a great object;
      so that she was extremely welcome, wherever she called.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ledwich promised to come to tea, and instantly prepared to walk to Miss Rich, and
      authorize her to send out the notes of summons to the morrow's meeting. Ethel offered to walk
      with her, and found Mrs. and Miss Rich in a flutter, after Dr. Spencer's call; the daughter
      just going to put on her bonnet and consult Mrs. Ledwich, and both extremely enchanted with
      Dr. Spencer, who 'would be such an acquisition.'</p>
     <p>The hour was fixed and the notes sent out, and Ethel met Dr. Spencer at the garden gate.</p>
     <p>'Well!' he said, smiling, 'I think we have fixed them off—have not we?'</p>
     <p>'Yes; but is it not heartless that everything should be done through so much nonsense?'</p>
     <p>'Did you ever hear why the spire of Ulm Cathedral was never finished?' said Dr. Spencer.</p>
     <p>'No; why not?'</p>
     <p>'Because the citizens would accept no help from their neighbours.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad enough of help when it comes in the right way, and from good motives.'</p>
     <pb n="462"/>
     <p>'There are more good motives in the world than you give people credit for, Ethel. You have a
      good father, good sense, and a good education; and you have some perception of the system by
      which things like this should be done. Unfortunately, the system is in bad hands here, and
      these good ladies have been left to work for themselves, and it is no wonder that there is
      plenty of little self-importance, nonsense, and the like, among them; but for their own sakes
      we should rather shew them the way, than throw them overboard.'</p>
     <p>'If they will be shown,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I can't say they seemed to me so very formidable,' said Dr. Spencer. 'Gentle little
      women.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! it is only Mrs. Ledwich that stirs them up. I hope you are prepared for that
      encounter.'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ledwich came to tea, sparkling with black bugles, and was very patronizing and amiable.
      Her visits were generally subjects of great dread, for she talked unceasingly, laid down the
      law, and overwhelmed Margaret with remedies; but to-night Dr. Spencer took her in hand. It was
      not that he went out of his ordinary self, he was always the same simple mannered, polished
      gentleman; but it was this that told—she was evidently somewhat in awe of him— the refinement
      kept her in check. She behaved very quietly all the evening, admired the plans, consented to
      everything, and was scarcely Mrs. Ledwich!</p>
     <p>'You will get on now, Ethel,' said Dr. May, afterwards. 'Never fear but that he will get the
      Ladies' Committee well in hand.'</p>
     <p>'Why do you think so, papa?'</p>
     <p>'Never you fear—'</p>
     <p>That was all she could extract from him, though he looked very arch.</p>
     <p>The Ladies' Committee accepted of their representatives with full consent; and the
      indefatigable Dr. Spencer next had to hunt up the fellow trustee. He finally contrived to
      collect everyone he wanted at Fordholm, the case was laid before the College—the College was
      propitious, and, by four o'clock in the evening, Dr. Spencer laid before Ethel the promise of
      the piece of land.</p>
     <p>Mary's joy was unbounded, and Ethel blushed, and tried to thank. This would have been the
      summit of felicity a year ago, and she was vexed with herself for feeling that though land and
      money were both in such safe hands, she could not care sufficiently to feel the ecstacy the
      attainment of her object would once have given to her. Then she would have been frantic with
      excitement, and heedless of everything; now she took it so composedly as to annoy herself.</p>
     <pb n="463"/>
     <p>'To think of that one week at Oxford having so entirely turned this head of mine!'</p>
     <p>Perhaps it was the less at home, because she had just heard that George and Flora had
      accepted an invitation to Glenbracken, but though the zest of Cocksmoor might be somewhat
      gone, she called herself to order, and gave her full attention to all that was planned by her
      champion.</p>
     <p>Never did man plunge into business more thoroughly than he, when he had once undertaken it.
      He was one of those men who, from gathering particulars of every practical matter that comes
      under their notice, are able to accomplish well whatever they set their hand to; and building
      was not new to him, though his former subjects—a Church and Mission station in India—bore
      little remembrance to the present.</p>
     <p>He bought a little round dumpling of a white pony, and trotted all over the country in
      search of building materials and builders, he discovered trees in distant timber-yards, he
      brought home specimens of stone, one in each pocket, to compare and analyze, he went to London
      to look at model schools, he drew plans each more neat and beautiful than the last, he
      compared builders' estimates, and wrote letters to the National Society, so as to be able to
      begin in the spring.</p>
     <p>In the meantime he was settling himself, furnishing his new house with great precision and
      taste. He would have no assistance in his choice, either of servants or furniture, but made
      numerous journeys of inspection to Whitford, to Malvern, and to London, and these seemed to
      make him the more content with Stoneborough. Sir Matthew Fleet had evidently chilled him, and
      as he found his own few remaining relations uncongenial, he became the more ready to find a
      resting place in the grey old town, the scene of his school life, beside the friend of his
      youth, and the children of her, for whose sake he had never sought a home of his own. Though
      he now and then talked of seeing America, or of going back to India, in hopes of assisting his
      beloved mission at Poonshedagore; these plans were fast dying away, as he formed habits and
      attachments, and perceived the sphere of usefulness open to him.</p>
     <p>It was a great step when his packages arrived, and his beautiful Indian curiosities were
      arranged, making his drawing-room as pretty a room as could anywhere be seen; in readiness, as
      he used to tell Ethel, for a grand tea-party for all the Ladies' Committee, when he should
      borrow her and the best silver tea-pot to preside. Moreover he had a chemical apparatus, a
      telescope, and microscope, of great power, wherewith he tried experiments that were the height
      of felicity to Tom and Ethel, and much interested their father. He
      <pb n="464"/> made it his business to have full occupation for himself, with plans, books, or
      correspondence, so as not to be a charge on the hands of the May family, with whom he never
      spent an evening without special and earnest invitation.</p>
     <p>He gave attendance at the hospital on alternate days, as well as taking off Dr. May's hands
      such of his gratuitous patients as were not averse to quit their old Doctor, and could believe
      in a physician in shepherd's plaid, and Panama hat. Exceedingly sociable, he soon visited
      every one far and wide, and went to every sort of party, from the grand dinners of the "county
      families," to the tea drinkings of the Stoneborough ladies, a welcome guest at all, and
      enjoying each in his own way. English life was so new to him that he entered into the little
      accessories with the zest of a youth; and there seemed to be a curious change between the two
      old fellow students, the elder and more staid of former days having come back with
      unencumbered freshness to enliven his friend, just beginning to grow aged under the wear of
      care and sorrows.</p>
     <p>It was very droll to hear Dr. May laughing at Dr. Spencer's histories of his adventures, and
      at the new aspects in which his own well-trodden district appeared to travelled eyes; and not
      less amusing was Dr. Spencer's resolute defence of all the Nine Muses, generally and
      individually.</p>
     <p>He certainly had no reason to think ill of them. As one woman, they were led by him, and
      conformed their opinions. The only seceder was Louisa Anderson, who had her brother for her
      oracle; and, indeed, the more youthful race, to whom Harvey was the glass of fashion, uttered
      disrespectful opinions as to the Doctor's age, and would not accede to his being, as Mrs.
      Ledwich declared, 'much younger than Dr. May.'</p>
     <p>Harvey Anderson had first attempted patronage, then argument, with Dr. Spencer, but found
      him equally impervious to both. 'Very clever, but an old world man,' said Harvey. 'He has made
      up his bundle of prejudices.'</p>
     <p>'Clever sort of lad!' said Dr. Spencer, 'a cool hand, but very shallow—'</p>
     <p>Ethel wondered to hear thus lightly disposed of, the powers of argument that had been
      thought fairly able to compete with Norman, and which had taxed him so severely. She did not
      know how differently abstract questions appear to a mature mind, confirmed in principle by
      practice; and to one young, struggling in self-formation, and more used to theories than to
      realities.</p>

     <p>Hector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning's shooting at the Grange, Dr.
      May promising to meet them, and let them drive him home.</p>
     <p>Meta was out, when he arrived; and, repairing to the library, he found Mr. Rivers sitting by
      a fire, though it was early in September, with the newspaper before him, but not reading. He
      looked depressed, and seemed much disappointed a having heard that George and Flora had
      accepted some further invitations in Scotland, and did not intend to return for another month.
      Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had met, but failed to enliven
      him, and, as if trying to assign some cause for his vexation, he lamented over fogs and
      frosts, and began to dread an October in Scotland for Flora, almost as if it were the Arctic
      regions.</p>
     <p>He grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora, and speaking of the great satisfaction he
      had in seeing his son married to so admirable a person. He only wished it would be the same
      with his daughter.</p>
     <p>'You are a very unselfish father,' said Dr. May. 'I cannot imagine you without your little
      fairy.'</p>
     <p>'It would be hard to part,' said Mr. Rivers, sighing; 'yet I should be relieved to see her
      in good hands, so pretty and engaging as she is, and something of an heiress. With our dear
      Flora, she is secure of a happy home when I am gone, but still I should be glad to have seen—'
      and he broke off thoughtfully.</p>
     <p>'She is so sensible, that we shall see her make a good choice,' said Dr. May, smiling; 'that
      is, if she choose at all, for I do not know who is worthy of her.'</p>
     <p>'I am quite indifferent as to fortune,' continued Mr. Rivers. 'She will have enough of her
      own.'</p>
     <p>'Enough not to be dependant, which is the point,' said Dr. May, 'though I should have few
      fears for her any way.'</p>
     <p>'It would be a comfort,' harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the
      <pb n="466"/> subject, as if he wanted to say something, 'if she were only safe with a man who
      knew how to value her, and make her happy. Such a young man as your Norman, now—I have often
      thought—'</p>
     <p>Dr. May would not seem to hear, but he could not prevent himself from blushing as crimson as
      if he had been the very Norman, as he answered, going on with his own speech, as if Mr.
      Rivers's had been unmade; 'She is the brightest little creature under the sun, and the sparkle
      is down so deep within, that however it may turn out, I should never fear for her
      happiness.'</p>
     <p>'Flora is my great reliance,' proceeded Mr. Rivers. 'Her aunt, Lady Leonora, is very kind,
      but somehow she does not seem to suit with Meta.'</p>
     <p>O ho, thought the Doctor, have you made that discovery, my good friend?</p>
     <p>The voices of the two boys were heard in the hall, explaining their achievements to Meta,
      and Dr. May took his departure, Hector driving him, and embarking in a long discourse on his
      own affairs, as if he had quite forgotten that the Doctor was not his father, and going on
      emphatically, in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor, who, at
      Dr. Spencer's door, exclaimed, 'Stop, Hector, let me out here—thank you;' and presently
      brought out his friend into the garden, and sat down on the grass, talking low, and earnestly,
      over the disease with which Mr. Rivers had been so long affected; for though Dr. May could not
      perceive any positively unfavourable system, he had been rendered vaguely uneasy by the
      unusual heaviness and depression of manner. So long did they sit conversing, that Blanche was
      sent out, primed with an impertinent message, that two such old Doctors ought to be ashamed of
      themselves for sitting so late in the dew.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer was dragged in to drink tea, and the meal had just been merrily concluded, when
      the door-bell rang, and a message was brought in. 'The carriage from the Grange, sir—Miss
      Rivers would be much obliged if you would come directly.'</p>
     <p>'There!' said Dr. May, looking at Dr. Spencer, as if to say I told you so; in the first
      triumph of professional sagacity; but the next moment exclaiming, 'Poor little Meta!' he
      hurried away.</p>
     <p>A gloom fell on those who remained, for, besides their sympathy for Meta, and their liking
      for her kind old father, there was that one unacknowledged heartache, which, though in general
      bravely combated, lay in wait always ready to prey on them. Hector stole round to sit by
      Margaret, and Dr. Spencer muttered, "this will never do," and sent Tom to fetch some papers
      lying on his table, whence he read them some curious accounts that he had just received from
      his Missionary friends in India.</p>
     <pb n="467"/>
     <p>They were interested, but in a listening mood, that caused a universal start when the bell
      again sounded. This time, James reported that the servant from the Grange said his master was
      very ill—he had brought a letter to post for Mr. George Rivers, and here was a note for Miss
      Ethel. It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father, and only contained these
      few words:—</p>
     <p>Dear E.</p>
     <p>I believe this attack will be the last. Come to Meta, and bring my things.</p>
     <p>R. M.</p>
     <p>Ethel put her hands to her forehead. It was as if she had been again plunged into the
      stunned dream of misery of four years ago, and her sensation was of equal bewilderment and
      uselessness, but it was but for a moment—the next she was in a state of over bustle and
      eagerness. She wanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta, and could hardly obey the word and
      gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side.</p>
     <p>'Dear Ethel, you must calm yourself, or you will not be of use.'</p>
     <p>'I? I can't be of any use! Oh! if you could go! If Flora were but here! But I must go,
      Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'I will put up your father's things,' said Dr. Spencer, in a soothing tone. 'The carriage
      cannot be ready in a moment, so that there will be full time.'</p>
     <p>Mary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel's own goods, which she would otherwise have forgotten;
      and Margaret, meanwhile, detained her by her side, trying to calm and encourage her with
      gentle words of council, that might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that
      had seized her, and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless.</p>
     <p>Adams was to drive her thither in the gig, and it presently came to the door. Dr. Spencer
      wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls, and spoke words of kindly cheer in her ear as she
      set off. The fresh night air blew pleasantly on her, the stars glimmered in full glory over
      head, and now and then her eye was caught by the rocket-like track of a shooting-star. Orion
      was rising slowly far in the east, and bringing to her mind the sailor-boy under the southern
      sky; if, indeed, he were not where sun and stars no more are the light. It was strange that
      the thought came more as soothing than as acute pain; she could bear to think of him thus in
      her present frame, as long as she had not to talk of him. Under those solemn stars, the Life
      Everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life, and Ethel's agitation was
      calmed away.</p>
     <p>The old cedar-tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky, and the lights in the
      house glanced behind it. The servants looked rather surprised to see Ethel, as if she were not
      expected, and conducted
      <pb n="468"/> her to the great drawing-room, which looked the more desolate and solitary, from
      the glare of lamplight, falling on the empty seats which Ethel had lately seen filled with a
      glad, home party. She was looking round, thinking whether to venture up to Meta's room, and
      there summon Bellairs, when Meta came gliding in, and threw her arms round her. Ethel could
      not speak, but Meta's voice was more cheerful than she had expected. 'How kind of you, dear
      Ethel!'</p>
     <p>'Papa sent for me,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'He is so kind! Can Margaret spare you?'</p>
     <p>'Oh, yes! but you must leave me. You must want to be with him.'</p>
     <p>'He never lets me come in when he has these attacks,' said Meta. 'If he only would! But will
      you come up to my room. That is nearer.'</p>
     <p>'Is papa with him?'</p>
     <p>'Yes.'</p>
     <p>Meta wound her arms round Ethel, and led her up to her sitting-room, where a book lay on the
      table. She said that her father had seemed weary and torpid, and had sat still until almost
      their late dinner hour, when he seemed to bethink himself of dressing, and had risen. She
      thought he walked weakly, and rather tottering, and had run to make him lean on her, which he
      did, as far as his own room door. There he had kissed her, and thanked her, and murmured a
      word like blessing. She had not, however, been alarmed, until his servant had come to tell her
      that he had another seizure.</p>
     <p>Ethel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her father. She had; but
      Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in the extent of his fears. She had become
      so far accustomed to these attacks, that, though anxious and distressed, she did not apprehend
      more than a few days' weakness, and her chief longing was to be of use. She was speaking
      cheerfully of beginning her nursing to-morrow, and of her great desire that her papa would
      allow her to sit up with him, when there was a slow, reluctant movement of the lock of the
      door, and the two girls sprang to their feet, as Dr. May opened it; and Ethel read his
      countenance at once.</p>
     <p>Not so Meta. 'How is he? May I go to him?' cried she.</p>
     <p>'Not now, my dear,' said Dr. May, putting his hand on her shoulder, in a gentle, detaining
      manner, that sent a thrill of trembling through her frame, though she did not otherwise move.
      She only clasped her hands together, and looked up into his face. He answered the look. 'Yes,
      my dear, the struggle is over.'</p>
     <pb n="469"/>
     <p>Ethel came near, and put her arm round Meta's waist, as if to strengthen her, as she stood
      quite passive, and still.</p>
     <p>Dr. May seemed to think it best that all should be told; but, though intently watching Meta,
      he directed his words to his own daughter. 'Thank Heaven, it has been shorter, and less
      painful, than I had dared to hope.'</p>
     <p>Meta tried to speak, but could not bring out the words, and, with an imploring look at
      Ethel, as if to beg her to make them clear for her, she inarticulately murmured, 'Oh! why did
      not you call me!'</p>
     <p>'I could not. He would not let me. His last conscious word to me was not to let you see him
      suffer.'</p>
     <p>Meta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish. Dr. May signed to Ethel to guide her
      back to the sofa, but the movement seemed so far to rouse her, that she said, 'I should like
      to go to bed.'</p>
     <p>'Right—the best thing,' said Dr. May; and he whispered to Ethel, 'go with her, but don't try
      to rouse her—don't talk to her. Come back to me, presently.'</p>
     <p>He did not even shake hands with Meta, nor wish her good-night, as she disappeared into her
      own room.</p>
     <p>Bellairs undressed her, and Ethel stood watching, till the young head, under the load of
      sorrow, so new to it, was laid on the pillow. Bellairs asked her if she would have a
      light.</p>
     <p>'No, no, thank you—the dark and alone. Good-night,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>Ethel went back to the sitting-room, where her father was standing at the window, looking
      out into the night. He turned as she came in, folded her in his arms, and kissed her forehead.
      'And how is the poor little dear?' he asked.</p>
     <p>'The same,' said Ethel. 'I can't bear to leave her alone, and to have said nothing to
      comfort her.'</p>
     <p>'It is too soon as yet,' said Dr. May—'her mind has not taken it in. I hope she will sleep
      all night, and have more strength to look at it when she wakens.'</p>
     <p>'She was utterly unprepared.'</p>
     <p>'I could not make her understand me,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'And, oh, papa, what a pity she was not there!'</p>
     <p>'It was no sight for her, till the last few minutes; and his whole mind seemed bent on
      sparing her. What tenderness it has been.'</p>
     <p>'Must we leave her to herself all night?'</p>
     <p>'Better so,' said Dr. May. 'She has been used to loneliness; and to thrust companionship on
      her would be only harassing.'</p>
     <p>Ethel, who scarcely knew what it was to be alone, looked as if she did not understand.</p>
     <pb n="470"/>
     <p>'I used to try to force consolation on people,' said Dr. May, 'but I know, now, that it can
      only be done by following their bent.'</p>
     <p>'You have seen so many sorrows,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I never understood till I felt,' said Dr. May. 'Those few first days were a lesson.'</p>
     <p>'I did not think you knew what was passing,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I doubt whether any part of my life is more distinctly before me than those two days,' said
      Dr. May. 'Flora coming in and out, and poor Alan sitting by me; but I don't believe I had any
      will. I could no more have moved my mind than my broken arm; and I verily think, Ethel, that,
      but for that merciful torpor, I should have been frantic. It taught me never to disturb
      grief.'</p>
     <p>'And what shall we do?'</p>
     <p>'You must stay with her till Flora comes. I will be here as much as I can. She is our
      charge, till they come home. I told him, between the spasms, that I had sent for you, and he
      seemed pleased.'</p>
     <p>'If only I were anybody else!'</p>
     <p>Dr. May again threw his arm round her, and looked into her face. He felt that he had rather
      have her, such as she was, than anybody else; and, together, they sat down, and talked of what
      was to be done, and what was best for Meta, and of the solemnity of being in the house of
      death. Ethel felt and shewed it so much, in her subdued, awe-struck manner, that her father
      felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary manner, familiarized, as he
      necessarily was, with the like scenes. It drew him back to the thought of their own trouble,
      and their conversation recurred to those days, so that each gained a more full understanding
      of the other, and they at length separated, certainly with the more peaceful and soft feelings
      for being in the abode of mourning.</p>
     <p>Bellairs promised to call Ethel, to be with her young lady as early as might be, reporting
      that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour, so that
      Ethel was up, and had been with Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found
      her half-dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast, and in
      going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that
      could not be entirely struck down, nor deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her
      eyes looked wandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered, as if she
      was not sure what she was doing or saying. Ethel told her not to mind— Dr. Spencer would take
      care of the patients; but she did not seem to recollect, at first, who Dr, Spencer was, nor to
      care for being reminded.</p>
     <pb n="471"/>
     <p>Breakfast was laid out in in the little sitting-room. Ethel wanted to take the trouble off
      her hands, but she would not let her. She sat behind her urn, and asked about tea or coffee,
      quite accurately, in a low, subdued voice, that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was
      over, and she had rung the bell, and risen up, as if to her daily work, she turned round, with
      that piteous, perplexed air, and stood for a moment, as if confused.</p>
     <p>'Cannot we help you?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I don't know. Thank you. But, Dr. May, I must not keep you from other people—'</p>
     <p>'I have no one to go to this morning,' said Dr. May. 'I am ready to stay with you, my
      dear.'</p>
     <p>Meta came closer to him, and murmured, 'Thank you!'</p>
     <p>The breakfast things had, by this time, been taken away, and Meta, looking to see that the
      door had shut for the last time, said, in a low voice, 'Now tell me—'</p>
     <p>Dr. May drew her down, to sit on the sofa beside him, and, in his soft, sweet voice, told
      her all that she wished to learn of her father's last hours, and was glad to see showers of
      quiet, wholesome tears drop freely down, but without violence, and she scarcely attempted to
      speak. There was a pause at the end, and then she said, gently, 'Thank you, for it all. Dear
      papa!' And she rose up, and went back to her room.</p>
     <p>'She has learnt to dwell apart,' said Dr. May, much moved.</p>
     <p>'How beautifully she bears up!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'It has been a life which, as she has used it, has taught her strength and self-dependance
      in the midst of prosperity.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, 'she has trained herself by her dread of self-indulgence, and seeking
      after work. But oh! what a break up it is for her! I cannot think how she holds up. Shall I go
      to her?'</p>
     <p>'I think not. She knows the way to the only Comforter. I am not afraid of her after those
      blessed tears.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May was right; Meta presently returned to them, in the same gentle subdued sadness,
      enfolding her, indeed, as a flower weighed down by mist, but not crushing nor taking away her
      powers. It was as if she were truly upheld; and thankful to her friends as she was, she did
      not throw herself on them in utter dependance or self-abandonment.</p>
     <p>She wrote needful letters, shedding many tears over them, and often obliged to leave off to
      give the blinding weeping its course, but refusing to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr.
      May's lame arm. All that was right, she strove to do; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot, and was
      refreshed by his reading to her, and when Dr. May desired it, she submissively put on her
      bonnet, and took several
      <pb n="472"/> turns with Ethel in the shrubbery, though it made her cry heartily to look into
      the down-stairs rooms. And she lay on the sofa at last, owning herself strangely tired, she
      did not know why, and glad that Ethel should read to her. By-and-by, she went to dress for the
      evening, and came back, full of the tidings that one of the children in the village had been
      badly burnt. It occupied her very much— she made Ethel promise to go and see about her
      to-morrow, and sent Bellairs at once with every comfort that she could devise.</p>
     <p>On the whole, those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable time. She saw more
      than usual of her father, and had such conversations with him as were seldom practicable at
      home, and that chimed in with the unavowed care which hung on their minds; while Meta was a
      most sweet and loving charge, without being a burthen, and often saying such beautiful things
      in her affectionate resignation, that Ethel could only admire and lay them up in her mind. Dr.
      May went backwards and forwards, and brought good accounts of Margaret and fond messages; he
      slept at the Grange each night, and Meta used to sit in her corner of the sofa and work, or
      not, as best suited her, while she listened to his talk with Ethel, and now and then herself
      joined.</p>
     <p>George Rivers' absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements; but his sister
      dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return; and often were the posts and the
      journeys reckoned over, without a satisfactory conclusion, as to when he could arrive from so
      remote a part of Scotland.</p>
     <p>At last, as the two girls had finished their early dinner, the butler brought in word that
      Mr. Norman May was there. Meta at once begged that he would come in, and Ethel went into the
      hall to meet him. He looked very man, with the dark rings round his eyes, a deeper purple than
      ever, and he could hardly find utterance to ask 'how is she?'</p>
     <p>'As good and sweet as she can be,' said Ethel, warmly; but no more, for Meta herself had
      come to the dining room door, and was holding out her hand. Norman took it in both his, but
      could not speak; Meta's own soft voice was the first. 'I thought you would come—he was so fond
      of you.'</p>
     <p>Poor Norman quite gave way, and Meta was the one to speak gentle words of soothing. 'There
      is so much to be thankful for,' she said. 'He has been spared so much of the suffering Dr. May
      feared for him; and he was so happy about George.'</p>
     <p>Norman made a great effort to recover himself. Ethel asked for Flora and George. It appeared
      that they had been on an excursion when the first letter arrived at Glenbracken, and thus had
      received both together in the evening, on their return. George had been
      <pb n="473"/> greatly overcome, and they had wished to set off instantly; but Lady Glenbracken
      would not hear of Flora's travelling night and day, and it had at length been arranged that
      Norman Ogilvie should drive Norman across the country that evening, to catch the mail for
      Edinburgh, and he had been on the road ever since. George was following with his wife more
      slowly, and would be at home to-morrow evening. Meantime, he sent full authority to his
      father-in-law to make arrangements.</p>
     <p>Ethel went to see the burnt child, leaving Meta to take her walk in the garden under
      Norman's charge. He waited on her with a sort of distant reverence for a form of grief, so
      unlike what he had dreaded for her, when the first shock of the tidings had brought back to
      him the shattered bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur.</p>
     <p>To dwell on the details, was, to her, a comfort, knowing his sympathy and the affection
      there had been between him and her father; nor had they parted in such absolute brightness, as
      to make them unprepared for such a meeting as the present. The cloud of suspense was brooding
      lower and lower over the May family, and the need of faith and submission was as great with
      them as with the young orphan herself. Norman said little, but that little was so deep and
      fervent, that after a time, Meta could not help saying, when Ethel was seen in the distance,
      and their talk was nearly over— 'Oh! Norman, these things are no mirage.'</p>
     <p>'It is the world that is the mirage,' he answered.</p>
     <p>Ethel came up, and Dr. May also, in good time for the post. He was obliged to become very
      busy, using Norman for his secretary, till he saw his son's eyes so heavy, that he remembered
      the two nights that he had been up, and ordered him to go home, and go to bed as soon as tea
      was over.</p>
     <p>'May I come back to-morrow?'</p>
     <p>'Why—yes—I think you may. No, no,' he added, recollecting himself, 'I think you had better
      not,' and he did not relent, though Norman looked disappointed.</p>
     <p>Meta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried at the suburban
      Church, where lay her mother; and Dr. May, having been desired to seek out the will and open
      it, found it was so; and fixed the day and hour with Meta, who was as submissive and
      reasonable as possible, though much grieved that he thought she could not be present.</p>
     <p>Ethel, after going with Meta to her room at night, returned as usual to talk matters over
      with him, and again say how good Meta was.'</p>
     <p>'And I think Norman's coming did her a great deal of good,' said Ethel.</p>
     <pb n="474"/>
     <p>'Ha! yes,' said the Doctor, thoughtfully.</p>
     <p>'She thinks so much of Mr. Rivers having been fond of him.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said the Doctor, 'he was. I find, in glancing over the will, which was newly made on
      Flora's marriage, that he has remembered Norman—left him £100 and his portfolio of prints from
      Raffaelle.'</p>
     <p>'Has he, indeed? how very kind—how much Norman will value it.'</p>
     <p>'It is remarkable,' said Dr. May, and then, as if he could not help it, told Ethel what Mr.
      Rivers had said of his wishes with regard to his daughter. Ethel blushed and smiled, and
      looked so much touched and delighted, that he grew alarmed and said, 'You know, Ethel, this
      must be as if it never had been mentioned.'</p>
     <p>'What! you will not tell Norman?'</p>
     <p>'No, certainly not, unless I see strong cause. They are very fond of each other, certainly,
      but they dont know, and I dont know, whether it is not like brother and sister. I would not
      have either of them guess at this, or feel bound in any way. Why, Ethel! she has thirty
      thousand pounds, and I dont know how much more.'</p>
     <p>'Thirty thousand!' said Ethel, her tone, one of astonishment, while his had been almost of
      objection.</p>
     <p>'It would open a great prospect,' continued Dr. May, complacently, 'with Norman's talents,
      and such a lift as that, he might be one of the first men in England, provided he had nerve
      and hardness enough, which I doubt.'</p>
     <p>'He would not care for it,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>"No; but the field of usefulness—but what an old fool I am, after all my resolutions not to
      be ambitious for that boy; to be set a going by such a thing as this! Still Norman is
      something out of the common way. I wonder what Spencer thinks of him."</p>
     <p>'And you never mean them to hear of it?'</p>
     <p>'If they settle it for themselves,' said Dr. May, 'that sanction will come in to give double
      value to mine—or if I should see poor Norman hesitating as to the inequality, I might smooth
      the way; but you see, Ethel, this puts us in a most delicate situation towards this pretty
      little creature. What her father wanted, was only to guard her from fortune-hunters, and if
      she should marry suitably elsewhere,—why—we will be contented.'</p>
     <p>'I dont think I should be,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'She is the most winning of humming birds, and what we see of her now, gives one double
      confidence in her. She is so far from the petted helpless girl, that he, poor man, would fain
      have made her! And she has a bright, brave, temper and elastic spirits that would be the very
      thing for him, poor boy, with that morbid sensitiveness—he would not hurt her, and she would
      brighten him.
      <pb n="475"/> It would be a very pretty thing—but we must never think about it again.'</p>
     <p>'If we can help it,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Ah! I am sorry I have put it into your head too. We shall not so easily be unconscious now,
      when they talk about each other in the innocent way they do. We have had a lesson against
      being pleased at match-making! But, turning away from the subject, 'You shall not lose your
      Cocksmoor income, Ethel—'</p>
     <p>'I had never thought of that. You had taken no fees here since we have been all one
      family.'</p>
     <p>'Well, he has been good enough to leave me £500, and Cocksmoor can have the interest, if you
      like.'</p>
     <p>'Oh thank you, papa.'</p>
     <p>'It is only its due, for I suppose that is for attendance. Personally, to myself, he has
      left that beautiful Claude which he knew I admired so much. He has been very kind! But after
      all, we ought not to be talking of all this—I should not have known it, if I had not been
      forced to read the will. Well, so we are in Flora's house, Ethel! I wonder how poor dear
      little Meta will feel the being a guest here, instead of the mistress. I wish that boy were
      three or four years older! I should like to take her straight home with us—I should like to
      have her for a daughter. I shall always look on her as one.'</p>
     <p>'As a Daisy!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Don't talk of it!' said Dr. May, hastily; 'this is no time for such things. After all, I am
      glad that the funeral is not here— Flora and Meta might be rather overwhelmed with these three
      incongruous sets of relations. By their letters, those Riverses must be quite as queer a lot
      as George's relations. After all, if we have nothing else, Ethel, we have the best of it, in
      regard to such relations as we have.'</p>
     <p>'There is Lord Cosham,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes, he is Meta's guardian, as well as her brother; but he could not have her to live with
      him. She must depend upon Flora. But we shall see—'</p>
     <p>Ethel felt confident that Flora would be very kind to her little sister-in-law, and yet one
      of those gleams of doubt crossed her, whether Flora would not be somewhat jealous of her own
      authority.</p>
     <p>Late the next evening, the carriage drove to the door, and George and Flora appeared in the
      hall. Their sisters went out to meet them, and George folded Meta in his arms, and kissing her
      again and again, called her his poor dear little sister, and wept bitterly, and even
      violently. Flora stood beside Ethel, and said, in a low voice, that poor George felt it
      dreadfully, and then came forward, touched him
      <pb n="476"/> gently, and told him that he must not overset Meta; and, drawing her from him,
      kissed her, and said what a grievous time this had been for her, and how sorry they had been
      to leave her so long, but they knew she was in the best hands.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I should have been so sorry you had been over-tired. I was quite well off,' said
      Meta.</p>
     <p>'And you must look on us as your home,' added Flora.</p>
     <p>How can she? thought Ethel. This is taking possession, and making Meta a guest already!</p>
     <p>However, Meta did not seem so to feel it—she replied by caresses, and turned again to her
      brother. Poor George was by far the most struck down of all the mourners, and his whole
      demeanour gave his new relations a much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have
      hoped to entertain. His gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller nature; and his
      want of attention, and many extravagances came back upon him acutely now, in his changed home.
      He could hardly bear to look at his little orphan sister, and lavished every mark of fondness
      upon her; nor could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table; but when they had gone into
      dinner, he turned away from the chair and hid his face. He was almost like a child in his want
      of self-restraint; and with all Dr. May's kind soothing manner, he could not bring him to
      attend to any of the necessary questions as to arrangements, and was obliged to refer to
      Flora, whose composed good sense was never at fault.</p>
     <p>Ethel was surprised to find that it would be a great distress to Meta to part with her until
      the funeral was over, though she would hardly express a wish, lest Ethel should be needed at
      home. As soon as Flora perceived this, she begged her sister to stay, and again Ethel felt
      unpleasantly that Meta might have seen, if she had chosen, that Flora took the invitation upon
      herself.</p>
     <p>So, while Dr. May, with George, Norman and Tom went to London, she remained, though not
      exactly knowing what good she was doing, unless by making the numbers rather less scanty; but
      both sisters declared her to be the greatest comfort possible; and when Meta shut herself up
      in her own room, where she had long learnt to seek strength in still communing with her own
      heart, Flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister to hers, and talk over ordinary
      subjects, in a tone that struck on Ethel's ear as a little incongruous— but then Flora had not
      been here from the first, and the impression could not be as strong. She was very kind, and
      her manner, when with others, was perfect, from its complete absence of affectation; but,
      alone with Ethel, there was a little complacency sometimes betrayed, and some curiosity
      whether her father had read the will. Ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to be
      extracted
      <pb n="477"/> from her, and it certainly did not diminish Flora's secret satisfaction in being
      "somebody."</p>
     <p>She told the whole history of her visits; first, how cordial Lady Leonora Langdale had been,
      and then, how happy she had been at Glenbracken. The old Lord and Lady, and Marjorie, all
      equally charming in their various ways; and Norman Ogilvie so good a son, and so highly
      thought of in his own country.</p>
     <p>'Did I tell you, Ethel, that he desired to be remembered to you?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, you said so.'</p>
     <p>'What has Coralie done with it?' continued Flora, seeking in her dressing-case. 'She must
      have put it away with my brooches. Oh, no, here it is. I had been looking for Cairn-gorm
      specimens in a shop, saying I wanted a brooch that you <hi>would</hi> wear, when Norman
      Ogilvie came riding after the carriage, looking quite hot and eager? He had been to some other
      place, and hunted this one up. Is it not a beauty?'</p>
     <p>It was one of the round Bruce brooches, of dark pebble, with a silver fern-leaf lying across
      it, the dots of small Cairn-gorm stones. 'The Glenbracken badge, you know,' continued
      Flora.</p>
     <p>Ethel twisted it about in her fingers, and said, 'Was not it meant for you?'</p>
     <p>'It was to oblige me, if you choose so to regard it,' said Flora, smiling. 'He gave me no
      injunctions; but, you see, you must wear it now. I shall not wear coloured brooches for a
      year.'</p>
     <p>Ethel sighed. She felt as if her black dress ought, perhaps, to be worn for a nearer cause.
      She had a great desire to keep that Glenbracken brooch; and surely it could not be wrong. To
      refuse it would be much worse, and would only lead to Flora's keeping it, and not caring for
      it.</p>
     <p>'Then it is your present, Flora?'</p>
     <p>'If you like better to call it so, my dear. I find Norman Ogilvie is going abroad in a few
      months. I think we ought to ask him here on his way.'</p>
     <p>'Flora! I wish you would not talk about such things!'</p>
     <p>'Do you really and truly, Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'Certainly not, at such a time as this,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>Flora was checked a little, and sat down to write to Marjorie Ogilvie. 'Shall I say you like
      the brooch, Ethel?' she asked, presently.</p>
     <p>'Say what is proper,' said Ethel, impatiently. 'You know what I mean, in the fullest sense
      of the word.'</p>
     <p>'Do I?' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I mean,' said Ethel, 'that you may say, simply and rationally,
      <pb n="478"/> that I like the thing, but I <hi>won't</hi> have it said as a message, or that I
      take it as his present.'</p>
     <p>'Very well,' said Flora, 'the whole affair is simple enough, if you would not be so
      conscious, my dear.'</p>
     <p>'Flora! I can't stand your calling me my dear!'</p>
     <p>'I am very much obliged to you,' said Flora, laughing, more than she would have liked to be
      seen, but recalled by her sister's look. Ethel was sorry at once. 'Flora, I beg your pardon, I
      did not mean to be cross, only please don't begin about that—Indeed, I think you had better
      leave out about the brooch altogether. No one will wonder at your passing it over in such a
      return as this.'</p>
     <p>'You are right,' said Flora, thoughtfully.</p>
     <p>Ethel carried the brooch to her own room, and tried to keep herself from speculating what
      had been Mr. Ogilvie's views in procuring it, and whether he remembered showing her, at
      Woodstock, which sort of fern was his badge, and how she had abstained from preserving the
      piece shut up in her guide-book.</p>
     <p>Meta's patient sorrow was the best remedy for proneness to such musings. How happy poor
      little Meta had been! The three sisters sat together that long day, and Ethel read to the
      others, and by-and-by went to walk in the garden with them, till, as Flora was going in, Meta
      asked, 'Do you think it would be wrong for me to cross the park to see that little burnt girl,
      as Mr. Wilmot is away to-day, and she has no one to go to her.'</p>
     <p>Flora could see no reason against it, and Meta and Ethel left the garden, and traversed the
      green park, in its quiet home beauty, not talking much, except that Meta said, 'Well! I think
      there is quite as much sweetness, as sadness, in this evening.'</p>
     <p>'Because of this calm autumn sunset beauty?' said Ethel. 'Look at the golden light coming in
      under the branches of the trees.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Meta, 'one cannot help thinking how much more beautiful it must be—'</p>
     <p>The two girls said no more, and came to the cottage, where so much gratitude was expressed
      at seeing Miss Rivers, that it was almost too much for her. She left Ethel to talk, and only
      said a few soft little words to her sick scholar, who seemed to want her voice and smile to
      convince her that the small mournful face under all that black crape, belonged to her own dear
      bright teacher.</p>
     <p>'It is odd,' said Meta, as they went back; 'it is seeing other people that makes one know it
      is all sad and altered—it seems so bewildering, though they are so kind.'</p>
     <p>'I know what you mean,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'One ought not to wish it to go on, because there are other people and other duties,' said
      Meta, 'but quietness is so peaceful.
      <pb n="479"/> Do you know, Ethel, I shall always think of those two first days, before anybody
      came, with you and Dr. May, as something very— very—precious,' she said, at last, with the
      tears rising.</p>
     <p>'I am sure I shall,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I don't know how it is, but there is something even in this affliction that makes it like—a
      strange sort of happiness,' said Meta, musingly.</p>
     <p>'I know what it is!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'That He is so very good?' said Meta, reverently.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Ethel, almost rebuked for the first thought, namely, that it was because Meta
      was so very good.</p>
     <p>'It does make one feel more confidence,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'"It is good for me to have been in trouble,"' repeated Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Meta. 'I hope it is not wrong or unkind in me to feel it, for I think dear papa
      would wish it; but I do not feel as if —miss him always as I shall—the spring of life were
      gone from me. I don't think it can, for I know no more pain or trouble can reach him, and
      there is—don't you think, Ethel, that I may think so? —especial care for the orphan, like a
      compensation. And there is hope, and work here. And I am very thankful! How much worse it
      would have been, if George had not been married! Dear Flora! Will you tell her, Ethel, how
      really I do wish her to take the command of me. Tell her it will be the greatest kindness in
      the world to make me useful to her.'</p>
     <p>'I will,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And please tell her that I am afraid I may forget, and take upon me, as if I were still
      lady of the house. Tell her I do not mean it, and I hope that she will check it.'</p>
     <p>'I think there is no fear of her forgetting that,' said Ethel, regretting the words before
      they were out of her mouth.</p>
     <p>'I hope I shall not,' said Meta. 'If I do, I shall drive myself away to stay with Aunt
      Leonora, and I don't want to do that at all. So please to make Flora understand that she is
      head, and I am ready to be hand and foot;' and Meta's bright smile shone out, with the
      pleasure of a fresh and loving service.</p>
     <p>Ethel understood the force of her father's words, that it was a brave, vigorous spirit.</p>
     <p>Dr. May came back with George, and staid to dinner, after which he talked over business with
      Flora, whose sagacity continually amazed him, and who undertook to make her husband
      understand, and do what was needed.</p>
     <p>Meta meanwhile cross-questioned her brother on the pretty village, by the Thames, of which
      she had a fond, childish remembrance, and heard from him of the numerous kind messages from
      <pb n="480"/> all her relations. There were various invitations, but George repeated them
      unwillingly.</p>
     <p>'You won't go, Meta,' he said. 'It would be a horrid nuisance to part with you.'</p>
     <p>'As long as you think so, dear George.—When I am in your way, or Flora's—'</p>
     <p>'That will never be! I say, Flora, will she ever be in our way?'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed! Meta and I understand that,' said Flora, looking up. 'Well, I suppose Bruce
      can't be trusted to value the books and prints—'</p>
     <p>Dr. May thought it a great relief that Meta had a home with Flora, for, as he said to Ethel,
      as they went home together, 'Certainly, except Lord Cosham, I never saw such an unpresentable
      crew as their relations. You should have heard the boys afterwards! There was Master Tom
      turning up his Eton nose at them, and pronouncing that there never were such a set of snobs,
      and Norman taking him to task as I never heard him do before—telling him that he would never
      have urged his going to Eton, if he had thought it would make him despise respectable folks,
      probably, better than himself, and that this was the last time in the world for such
      observations—whereat poor Tommy was quite annihilated; for a word from Norman goes further
      with him, than a lecture from any one else.'</p>
     <p>'Well, I think Norman was right as to the unfitness of the time.'</p>
     <p>'So he was. But we had a good deal of them, waiting in the inn parlour. People make
      incongruities when they will have such things done in state. It could not be helped here, to
      be sure; but I always feel, at a grand undertaker's display like this, that, except the
      service itself, there is little to give peace or soothing. I hate what makes a talk! Better be
      little folk.'</p>
     <p>'One would rather think of our own dear cloister, and those who cared so much,' said
      Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Ah! you were happy to be there!' said Dr. May. 'But it all comes to the same.—' Pausing, he
      looked from the window— then signed to Ethel, to do the same—Orion glittered in the
      darkness.</p>
     <p>'One may sleep sound without the lullaby,' said Dr. May, 'and the waves.—'</p>
     <p>'Oh! don't papa. You don't give up hope!'</p>
     <p>'I believe we ought, Ethel. Don't tell her, but I went to the Admiralty to-day.'</p>
     <p>'And what did you hear there?'</p>
     <p>'Great cause for fear—but they do not give up. My poor Margaret! But those stars tells us
      they are in the same Hand.'</p>

     <p>'O <hi>Norman</hi> , are you come already?' exclaimed Margaret, as her brother opened the
      door, bringing in with him the crisp breath of December.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I came away directly after collections. How are you Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'Pretty brave, thank you;' but the brother and sister both read on each other's features,
      that the additional three months of suspense had told. There were traces of toil and study on
      Norman's brow, the sunken look about his eyes, and the dejected outline of his cheek, Margaret
      knew betokened discouragement; and though her mild serenity was not changed, she was almost
      transparently thin and pale. They had long ago left off asking whether there were tidings, and
      seldom was the subject adverted to, though the whole family seemed to be living beneath a dark
      shadow.</p>
     <p>'How is Flora?' he next asked.</p>
     <p>'Going on beautifully, except that papa thinks she does too much in every way. She declares
      that she shall bring the baby to show me in another week, but I don't think it will be
      allowed.'</p>
     <p>'And the little lady prospers?'</p>
     <p>'Capitally, though I get rather contradictory reports of her. First, papa declared her
      something surpassing—exactly like Flora, and so I suppose she is; but Ethel and Meta will say
      nothing for her beauty, and Blanche calls her a fright. But papa is her devoted admirer—he
      does so enjoy having a sort of property again in a baby.'</p>
     <p>'And George Rivers?' said Norman, smiling.</p>
     <p>'Poor George! he is very proud of her in his own way. He has just been here with a note from
      Flora, and actually talked! Between her and the election, he is wonderfully brilliant.'</p>
     <pb n="482"/>
     <p>'The election? Has Mr. Esdaile resigned?'</p>
     <p>'Have you not heard? He intends it, and George himself is going to stand. The only danger
      is, that Sir Henry Walkinghame should think of it.'</p>
     <p>'Rivers in parliament! Well, sound men are wanted.'</p>
     <p>'Fancy Flora, our member's wife. How well she will become her position.'</p>
     <p>'How soon is it likely to be?'</p>
     <p>'Quickly, I fancy. Dr. Spencer, who knows all kinds of news (Papa says he makes a scientific
      study of gossip, as a new branch of comparative anatomy), found out from the Clevelands, that
      Mr. Esdaile meant to retire, and happened to mention it the last time that Flora came to see
      me. It was like firing a train. You would have wondered to see how it excited her, who usually
      shows her feelings so little. She has been so much occupied with it, and so anxious that
      George should be ready to take the field at once, that papa was afraid of its hurting her, and
      Ethel comes home declaring that the election is more to her than her baby.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel is apt to be a little hard on Flora. They are too unlike to understand each
      other.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel is to be godmother though, and Flora means to ask Mr. Ogilvie to come and stand.'</p>
     <p>'I think he will be gone abroad, or I should have asked him to fulfil his old promise of
      coming to us.'</p>
     <p>'I believe he must be lodged here, if he should come. Flora will have her house full, for
      Lady Leonora is coming. The baby is to be called after her.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed!' exclaimed Norman.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I thought it unnecessary, as she is not George's aunt, but Flora is grateful to her
      for much kindness, and she is coming to see Meta. I am afraid papa is a little hurt, that any
      name but one should have been chosen.'</p>
     <p>'Has Meta been comfortable?'</p>
     <p>'Dear little thing! Everyone says how beautifully she has behaved. She brought all her
      housekeeping books to Flora at once, and only begged to be made helpful in whatever way might
      be most convenient. She explained, what we never knew before, how she had the young maids in
      to read with her, and asked leave to go on. Very few could have been set aside so simply and
      sweetly in their own house.'</p>
     <p>'Flora was sensible of it, I hope.'</p>
     <p>'O yes. She took the management of course, but Meta is charmed with her having the girls in
      from the village, in turn, to help in the scullery. They have begun family prayers too, and
      <pb n="483"/> George makes the stable men go to Church—a matter which had been past Meta, as
      you may guess, though she had been a wonderful little manager, and Flora owned herself quite
      astonished.'</p>
     <p>'I wonder only at her being astonished.'</p>
     <p>'Meta owned to Ethel that what had been worst of all to her was the heart sinking, at
      finding herself able to choose her occupations, with no one to accommodate them to. But she
      would not give way— she set up more work for herself at the school, and has been talking of
      giving singing lessons at Cocksmoor; and she forced herself to read, though it was an effort.
      She has been very happy lately in nursing Flora.'</p>
     <p>'Is Ethel there?'</p>
     <p>'No; she is, as usual, at Cocksmoor. There are great councils about sending Cherry to be
      trained for her new school.'</p>
     <p>'Would Flora be able to see me, if I were to ride over to the Grange?'</p>
     <p>'You may try; and, if papa is not there, I dare say she will.</p>
     <p>'At least, I shall see Meta, and she may judge. I want to see Rivers too, so I will ask if
      the bay is to be had. Ah! you have the Claude, I see.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, it is too large for this room; but papa put it here that I might enjoy it, and it is
      almost a companion. The sky improves so in the sunset light.</p>
     <p>Norman was soon at Abbotstoke; and, as he drew his rein, Meta's bright face nodded to him
      from Flora's sitting-room window; and, as he passed the conservatory, the little person met
      him, with a summons, at once, to his sister.</p>
     <p>He found Flora on the sofa, with a table beside her, covered with notes and papers. She was
      sitting up writing; and, though somewhat pale, was very smiling and animated.</p>
     <p>'Norman, how kind to come to me the first thing!'</p>
     <p>'Margaret encouraged me to try whether you would be visible.'</p>
     <p>'They want to make a regular prisoner of me,' said Flora, laughing. 'Papa is as bad as the
      old nurse! But he has not been here to-day, so I have had my own way. Did you meet
      George?'</p>
     <p>'No; but Margaret said he had been with her.'</p>
     <p>'I wish he would come. We expect the second post to bring the news that Mr. Esdaile has
      accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. If he found it so, he meant to go and talk to Mr. Bramshaw;
      for, though he is so dull, we must make him agent.'</p>
     <p>'Is there any danger of opposition?'</p>
     <p>'None at all, if we are soon enough in the field. Papa's name will secure us, and there is
      no one else on the right side to come forward, so that it is an absolute rescue of the
      seat.'</p>
     <pb n="484"/>
     <p>'It is the very moment when men of principle are most wanted,' said Norman. 'The questions
      of the day are no light matters; and it is an immense point to save Stoneborough from being
      represented by one of the Tomkins' set.'</p>
     <p>'Exactly so,' said Flora. 'I should feel it a crime to say one word to deter George, at a
      time when every effort must be made to support the right cause. One must make sacrifices when
      the highest interests are at stake.'</p>
     <p>Flora seemed to thrive upon her sacrifice—she had never appeared more brilliant and joyous.
      Her brother saw, in her, a Roman matron; and the ambition that was inherent in his nature,
      began to find compensation for being crushed, as far as regarded himself, by soaring for
      another. He eagerly answered that he fully agreed with her, and that she would never repent
      urging her husband to take on himself the duties incumbent on all who had the power.</p>
     <p>Highly gratified, she asked him to look at a copy of George's intended address, which was
      lying on the table. He approved of the tenor, but saw a few phrases susceptible of a better
      point. 'Give it,' she said, putting a pen into his hand; and he began to interline and erase
      her fair manuscript, talking earnestly, and working up himself and the address at the same
      time, till it had grown into a composition far superior to the merely sensible affair it had
      been. Eloquence and thought were now in the language, and substance—and Flora was
      delighted.</p>
     <p>'I have been very disrespectful to my niece all this time,' said Norman, descending from the
      clouds of patriotism.</p>
     <p>'I do not mean to inflict her mercilessly on her relations,' said Flora, but I should like
      you to see her. She is so like Blanche.'</p>
     <p>The little girl was brought in, and Flora made a very pretty young mother, as she held her
      in her arms, with so much graceful pride. Norman was perfectly entranced—he had never seen his
      sister so charming or so admirable, between her delight in her infant, and her self-devotion
      to the good of her husband and her country— acting so wisely, and speaking so considerately;
      and praising her dear Meta with so much warmth. He would never have torn himself away, had not
      the nurse hinted that Mrs. Rivers had had too much excitement and fatigue already to-day; and,
      besides, he suspected that he might find Meta in the drawing-room, where he might discuss the
      whole with her, and judge for himself of her state of spirits.</p>
     <p>Flora's next visitor was her father, who came as the twilight was enhancing the comfortable
      red brightness of the fire. He was very happy in these visits—mother and child had both
      prospered so well, and it was quite a treat to be able to expend his tenderness on Flora.
      <pb n="485"/> His little grandchild seemed to renew his own happy days, and he delighted to
      take her from her mother, and fondle her. No sooner was the baby in his arms, than Flora's
      hands were busy among the papers, and she begged him to ring for lights.</p>
     <p>'Not yet,' he said. 'Why can't you sit in the dark, and give yourself a little rest?'</p>
     <p>'I want you to hear George's address. Norman has been looking at it, and I hope you will not
      think it too strong,' and she turned, so that the light might fall on the paper.</p>
     <p>'Let me see,' said Dr. May, holding out his hand for it.</p>
     <p>'This is a rough copy, too much scratched for you to make out.'</p>
     <p>She read it accordingly, and her father admired it exceedingly— Norman's touches, above all;
      and Flora's reading had dovetailed all so neatly together that no one knew where the joins
      were. 'I will copy it fairly,' she said, 'if you will shew it to Dr. Spencer, and ask whether
      he thinks it too strong. Mr. Dodsley too; he would be more gratified if he saw it first, in
      private, and thought himself consulted.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May was dismayed at seeing her take up her pen, make a desk of her blotting-book, and
      begin her copy by firelight.</p>
     <p>'Flora, my dear,' he said, 'this must not be. Have I not told you that you must be content
      to rest?'</p>
     <p>'I did not get up till ten o'clock, and have been lying here ever since.'</p>
     <p>'But what has this head of yours been doing? Has it been resting for ten minutes together?
      Now, I know what I am saying, Flora—I warn you, that if you will not give yourself needful
      quiet now, you will suffer for it by-and-by.'</p>
     <p>Flora smiled, and said, 'I thought I had been very good. But, what is to be done when one's
      wits will work, and there is work for them to do?'</p>
     <p>'Is not there work enough for them here?' said Dr. May, looking at the babe. 'Your mother
      used to value such a retirement from care.'</p>
     <p>Flora was silent for a minute, then said, 'Mr. Esdaile should have put off his resignation
      to suit me. It is an unfortunate time for the election.</p>
     <p>'And you can't let the election alone?'</p>
     <p>She shook her head, and smiled a negative, as if she would, but that she was under a
      necessity.</p>
     <p>'My dear, if the election cannot go on without you, it had better not go on at all.'</p>
     <p>She looked very much hurt, and turned away her head.</p>
     <p>Her father was grieved. 'My dear,' he added, 'I know you
      <pb n="486"/> desire to be of use, especially to George; but do you not believe that he would
      rather fail, than that you, or his child, should suffer?'</p>
     <p>No answer.</p>
     <p>'Does he stand by his own wish, or yours, Flora?'</p>
     <p>'He wishes it. It is his duty,' said Flora, collecting her dignity.</p>
     <p>'I can say no more, except to beg him not to let you exert yourself.'</p>
     <p>Accordingly, when George came home, the Doctor read him a lecture on his wife's over-busy
      brain; and was listened to, as usual, with gratitude and deference. He professed that he only
      wished to do what was best for her, but she never would spare herself; and, going to her side,
      with his heavy, fond solicitude, he made her promise not to hurt herself, and she laughed and
      consented.</p>
     <p>The promise was easily given, for she did not believe she was hurting herself; and, as to
      giving up the election, or ceasing secretly to prompt George, that was absolutely out of the
      question. What could be a greater duty than to incite her husband to usefulness?'</p>
     <p>Moreover it was but proper to invite Meta's aunt and cousin to see her, and to project a few
      select dinners for their amusement, and the gratification of her neighbours. It was only
      grateful and cousinly likewise, to ask the "Master of Glenbracken;" and as she saw the thrill
      of colour on Ethel's cheeks, at the sight of the address to the Honorable Norman Ogilvie, she
      thought herself the best of sisters. She even talked of Ogilvie as a second Christian name,
      but Meta observed that old aunt Dorothy would call it Leonorar Rogilvie Rivers, and thus
      averted it, somewhat to Ethel's satisfaction.</p>
     <p>Ethel scolded herself many times for wondering whether Mr. Ogilvie would come. What was it
      to her? Suppose he should; suppose the rest. What a predicament! How unreasonable and
      conceited, even to think of such a thing, when her mind was made up. What could result, save
      tossings to and fro, a passing gratification set against infinite pain, and strife with her
      own heart, and with her father's unselfishness! Had he but come before Flora's marriage! No;
      Ethel hated herself for the wish that arose for the moment. Far better he should keep away,
      if, perhaps, without the slightest inclination towards her, his mere name could stir up such a
      tumult—all, it might be, founded in vanity. Rebellious feelings and sense of tedium had once
      been subdued—why should they be roused again?</p>
     <p>The answer came. Norman Ogilvie was setting off for Italy, and regretted that he could not
      take Abbotstoke on his way. He desired his kind remembrances and warm Christmas wishes to all
      his cousins.</p>
     <pb n="487"/>
     <p>If Ethel breathed more freely, there was a sense that tranquillity is uninteresting. It was,
      it must be confessed, a flat end to a romance, that all the permanent present effect was a
      certain softening, and a degree more attention to her appearance; and after all, this might,
      as Flora averred, be ascribed to the Paris outfit having taught her to wear clothes; as well
      as to that which had awakened the feminine element, and removed that sense of not being like
      other women, which sometimes hangs painfully about girls who have learnt to think themselves
      plain or awkward.</p>
     <p>There were other causes why it should be a dreary winter to Ethel, under the anxiety that
      strengthened by duration, and the strain of acting cheerfulness for Margaret's sake. Even Mary
      was a care. Her round rosy childhood had worn into height and sallowness, and her languor and
      indifference fretted Miss Bracy, and was hunted down by Ethel, till Margaret convinced her
      that it was a case for patience and tenderness, which, thenceforth, she heartily gave, even
      encountering a scene with Miss Bracy, who was much injured by the suggestion that Mary was
      oppressed by perspective. Poor Mary, no one guessed the tears nightly shed over Harry's
      photograph.</p>
     <p>Nor could Ethel quite fathom Norman. He wore the dispirited, burthened expression that she
      knew too well, but he would not, as formerly, seek relief in confidence to her, shunning the
      being alone with her, and far too much occupied to offer to walk to Cocksmoor. When the
      intelligence came that good old Mr. Wilmot of Settlesham had peacefully gone to his rest,
      after a short and painless illness, Tom was a good deal affected, in his peculiar silent and
      ungracious fashion; but Norman did not seek to talk over the event, and the feelings he had
      entertained two years ago—he avoided the subject, and threw himself into the election matters
      with an excitement, foreign to his nature.</p>
     <p>He was almost always at Abbotstoke, or attending George Rivers at the committee room at the
      Swan, talking, writing, or consulting, concocting squibs, and perpetrating <hi>bon mots</hi> ,
      that were the delight of friends and the confusion of foes. Flora was delighted, George adored
      him, Meta's eyes danced whenever he came near, Dr. Spencer admired him, and Dr. Hoxton
      prophesied great things of him; but Ethel did not feel as if he were the veritable Norman, and
      had an undefined sensation of discomfort, when she heard his brilliant repartees, and the
      laughter with which he accompanied them, so unlike his natural rare and noiseless laugh. She
      knew it was false excitement, to drive away the suspense that none dared to avow, but which
      did not press on them the less heavily, for being endured in silence. Indeed, Dr. May could
      not help now and then giving way to outbursts of
      <pb n="488"/> despondency, of which his friend, Dr. Spencer, who made it his special charge to
      try to lighten his troubles, was usually the kind recipient.</p>
     <p>And though the bustle of the election was incongruous, and seemed to make the leaden weight
      the more heavy, there was a compensation in the tone of feeling that it elicited, which gave
      real and heartfelt pleasure.</p>
     <p>Dr. May had undergone numerous fluctuations of popularity. He had always been the same man,
      excellent in intention, though hasty in action, and heeding neither praise nor censure; and
      while the main tenor of his course never varied, making many deviations by-flying to the
      reverse of the wrong, most immediately before him; still his personal character gained esteem
      every year; and though sometimes his merits, and sometimes his failings, gave violent umbrage,
      he had steadily risen in the estimation of his fellow-townsmen, as much as his own
      inconsistencies and theirs would allow, and every now and then was the favourite with all,
      save with the few who abused him for tyranny, because he prevented them from tyrannizing.</p>
     <p>He was just now on the top of the wave, and his son-in-law had nothing to do but to float in
      on the tide of his favour. The opposite faction attempted a contest, but only rendered the
      triumph more complete, and gave the gentlemen the pleasure of canvassing, and hearing, times
      without number, that the constituents only wished the candidate were Dr. May himself. His sons
      and daughters were full of exultation—Dr. Spencer, much struck, rallied "Dick" on his
      influence—and Dr. May, the drops of warm emotion trembling on his eye-lashes, smiled, and bade
      his friend see him making a Church-rate.</p>
     <p>The addresses and letters that came from the Grange were so admirable, that Dr. May often
      embraced Norman's steady opinion, that George was a very wise man. If Norman was unconscious
      how much he contributed to these compositions, he knew far less how much was Flora's. In his
      ardour, he crammed them both, and conducted George when Flora could not be at his side. George
      himself was a personable man, wrote a good bold hand, would do as he was desired, and was not
      easily put out of countenance; he seldom committed himself by talking; and when a speech was
      required, was brief, and to the purpose. He made a very good figure, and in the glory of
      victory, Ethel herself began to grow proud of him, and the children's great object in life was
      to make the jackdaws cry, "Rivers for ever!"</p>
     <p>Flora had always declared that she would be at Stoneborough for the nomination. No one
      believed her, until three days before, she presented herself and her daughter before the
      astonished Margaret,
      <pb n="489"/> who was too much delighted to be able to scold. She had come away on her own
      responsibility, and was full of triumph. To come home in this manner, after having read
      "Rivers for ever!" on all the dead walls, might be called that for which she had lived. She
      made no stay—she had only come to show her child, and establish a precedent for driving out,
      and Margaret had begun to believe the apparition a dream, when the others came in, some from
      Cocksmoor, others from the Committee-room at the Swan.</p>
     <p>'So she brought the baby,' exclaimed Ethel. 'I should have thought she would not have taken
      her out before her Christening.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel,' said Dr. Spencer, 'permit me to make a suggestion. When relations live in the same
      neighbourhood, there is no phrase to be more avoided than "I should have thought—"'</p>
     <p>The nomination-day brought Flora, Meta, baby and all to be very quiet, as was said; but how
      could that be? when every boy in the house was frantic, and the men scarcely less so. Aubrey
      and Gertrude, and the two jackdaws, each had a huge blue and orange rosette, and the two
      former went about roaring "Rivers for ever!" without the least consideration for the baby, who
      would have been decked in the same manner, if Ethel would have heard of it without
      indignation, at her wearing any colour before her Christening white; as to Jack and Jill,
      though they <hi>could</hi> say their lesson, they were too much distressed by their ornaments
      to do ought but lurk in corners, and strive to peck them off.</p>
     <p>Flora comported herself in her usual quiet way, and tried to talk of other things, though a
      carnation spot in each cheek shewed her anxiety and excitement. She went with her sisters to
      look out from Dr. Spencer's windows towards the Town Hall. Her husband gave her his arm as
      they went down the garden, and Ethel saw her talking earnestly to him, and pressing his arm
      with her other hand to enforce her words, but if she did tutor him, it was hardly visible, and
      he was very glad of whatever counsel she gave.</p>
     <p>She spoke not a word after the ladies were left with Aubrey, who was in despair at not being
      allowed to follow Hector and Tom, but was left, as his prematurely classical mind expressed
      it, like the Gaulish women with the impedimenta in the marshes—whereas Tom had added insult to
      injury, by a farewell to "Jack among the maidens."</p>
     <p>Meta tried to console him, by persuading him that he was their protector, and he began to
      think there was need of a guard, when a mighty cheer caused him to take refuge behind Ethel.
      Even when assured that it was anything but terrific, he gravely declared that he thought
      Margaret would want him, but—he could not cross the garden without Meta to protect him.</p>
     <pb n="490"/>
     <p>She would not allow anyone else to relieve her from the doughty champion, and thereby she
      missed the spectacle. It might be that she did not regret it, for though it would have been
      unkind to refuse to come in with her brother and sister, her wound was still too fresh for
      crowds, turmoil, and noisy rejoicing to be congenial. She did not withdraw her hand, which
      Aubrey squeezed harder at each resounding shout, nor object to his conducting her to see his
      museum in the dark corner of the attics, most remote from the tumult.</p>
     <p>The loss was not great. The others could hear nothing distinctly, and see only a wilderness
      of heads; but the triumph was complete. Dr. May had been cheered enough to satisfy even
      Hector; George Rivers had made a very fair speech, and hurrahs had covered all deficiencies;
      Hector had shouted till he was as hoarse as the jackdaws; the opposite candidate had never
      come forward at all; Tomkins was hiding his diminished head; and the gentlemen had nothing to
      report but success, and were in the highest spirits.</p>
     <p>By-and-by Blanche was missing, and Ethel, going in quest of her, spied a hem of blue merino
      peeping out under all the cloaks in the hall cupboard, and found the poor little girl sobbing
      in such distress, that it was long before any explanation could be extracted, but at last it
      was revealed—when the door had been shut, and they stood in the dark, half stifled among the
      cloaks, that George's spirits had taken his old facetious style with Blanche, and in the very
      hearing of Hector! The misery of such jokes to a sensitive child, conscious of not
      comprehending their scope, is incalculable, and Blanche having been a baby-coquette, was the
      more susceptible. She hid her face again from the very sound of her own confession, and
      resisted Ethel's attempts to draw her out of the musty cupboard, declaring that she could
      never see either of them again. Ethel, in vain, assured her that George was gone to the dinner
      at the Swan; nothing was effectual but being told that, for her to notice what had passed, was
      the sure way to call Hector's attention thereto, when she bridled, emerged, and begged to know
      whether she looked as if she had been crying. Poor child, she could never again be
      unconscious, but, at least, she was rendered peculiarly afraid of a style of notice, that
      might otherwise have been a temptation.</p>
     <p>Ethel privately begged Flora to hint to George to alter his style of wit, and the suggestion
      was received better than the blundering manner deserved; Flora was too exulting to take
      offence, and her patronage of all the world was as full-blown as her ladylike nature allowed.
      Ethel, she did not attempt to patronize, but she promised all the sights in London to the
      children, and masters to Mary and Blanche, and she perfectly overwhelmed Miss Bracy with
      orphan asylums for her sisters. She would have liked nothing better than
      <pb n="491"/> dispersing cards, with Mrs. Rivers prominent among the recommenders of the
      case.</p>
     <p>'A fine coming-out for you, little lady,' said she to her baby, when taking leave that
      evening. 'If it was good luck for you to make your first step in life upwards, what is
      this?'</p>
     <p><hi>'Excelsior?</hi> ' said Ethel, and Flora smiled, well-pleased, but she had not caught
      half the meaning. 'May it be the right <hi>excelsior</hi> ,' added Ethel, in a low voice, that
      no one heard, and she was glad they did not. They were all triumphant, and she could not tell
      why she had a sense of sadness, and thought of Flora's story long ago, of the girl who
      ascended Mont Blanc, and for what?</p>
     <p>All she had to do at present was to listen to Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers
      thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the
      intended kindness to her sister.</p>
     <p>Ethel had more sympathy here, for she had thought that Flora was giving herself airs, and
      she laughed and said her sister was pleased to be in a position to help her friends; and tried
      to turn it off, but ended by stumbling into allowing that prosperity was apt to make people
      over lavish of offers of kindness.</p>
     <p>'Dear Miss Ethel, you understand so perfectly. There is no one like you!' cried Miss Bracy,
      attempting to kiss her hand.</p>
     <p>If Ethel had not spoken rightly of her sister, she was sufficiently punished.</p>
     <p>What she did was to burst into a laugh, and exclaim, 'Miss Bracy! Miss Bracy! I can't have
      you sentimental. I am the worst person in the world for it.'</p>
     <p>'I have offended. You cannot feel with me!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I can, when it is sense; but please don't treat me like a heroine. I am sure there is
      quite enough in the world that is worrying, without picking shades of manner to pieces. It is
      the sure way to make an old crab of me, and so I am going off. Only, one parting piece of
      advice, Miss Bracy—read 'Frank Fairlegh,' and put everybody out of your head.'</p>
     <p>And, thinking she had been savage about her hand, Ethel turned back, and kissed the little
      governess's forehead, wished her good-night, and ran away.</p>
     <p>She had learnt that, to be rough and merry, was the best way of doing Miss Bracy good in the
      end; and so she often gave herself the present pain of knowing that she was being supposed
      careless and hard-hearted; but the violent affection for her proved that the feeling did not
      last.</p>
     <p>Ethel was glad to sit by the fire at bed-time, and think over the day, outwardly so gay,
      inwardly so fretting and perplexing.</p>
     <pb n="492"/>
     <p>It was the first time that she had seen much of her little niece. She was no great
      baby-handler, nor had she any of the phrases adapted to the infant mind; but that pretty
      little serene blue-eyed girl had been her chief thought all day, and she was abashed by
      recollecting how little she had dwelt on her own duties as her sponsor, in the agitations
      excited by the doubts about her coadjutor.</p>
     <p>She took out her Prayer-book, and read the service for Baptism, recollecting, the thoughts
      that had accompanied her youngest sister's orphaned Christening, 'The vain pomp and glory of
      the world, and all covetous desires of the same.' They seemed far enough off then, and
      now—poor little Leonora!</p>
     <p>Ethel knew that she judged her sister hardly; yet she could not help picturing to herself
      the future—a young lady, trained for fashionable life, serious teaching not omitted, but right
      made the means of rising in the world; taught to strive secretly, but not openly, for
      admiration—a scheming for her marriage—a career like Flora's own. Ethel could scarcely feel
      that it would not be a mockery to declare, on her behalf, that she renounced the world. But,
      alas! where was not the world? Ethel blushed at having censured others, when, so lately, she
      had herself been oblivious of the higher duty. She thought of the prayer, including every
      Christian in holy and loving intercession—'I pray not that Thou wouldest take them out of the
      world, but that Thou wouldest keep them from the evil.'</p>
     <p>"Keep her from the evil—that shall be my prayer for my poor little Leonora. His Grace can
      save her, were the surrounding evil far worse than ever it is likely to be. The intermixture
      with good is the trial, and is it not so everywhere—ever since the world and the Church have
      seemed fused together? But she will soon be the child of a Father who guards His own; and, at
      least, I can pray for her, and her dear mother. May I only live better, that so I may pray
      better, and act better, if ever I should have to act."</p>
     <p>There was a happy family gathering on the New Year's Day, and Flora, who had kindly felt her
      way with Meta, finding her not yet ready to enjoy a public festivity for the village, added a
      supplement to the Christmas beef; that a second dinner might be eaten at home, in honour of
      Miss Leonora Rivers.</p>
     <p>Lady Leonora was highly satisfied with her visit, which impressed her far more in favour of
      the Abbotstoke neighbourhood than in the days of poor old Mr. Rivers. Flora knew everyone, and
      gave little select dinner parties, which, by her good management, even George, at the bottom
      of the table, could not make heavy. Dr. Spencer enjoyed them greatly, and was an unfailing
      resource for conversation; and as to the Hoxtons, Flora felt herself amply repaying the
      kindness
      <pb n="493"/> she had received in her young lady days, when she walked down to the dining-room
      with the portly head master, or saw his good lady sit serenely admiring the handsome rooms. 'A
      very superior person, extremely pleasing and agreeable,' was the universal verdict on Mrs.
      Rivers. Lady Leonora struck up a great friendship with her, and was delighted that she meant
      to take Meta to London. The only fault that could be found with her was that she had so many
      brothers; and Flora, recollecting that her Ladyship mistrusted those brothers, avoided
      encouraging their presence at the Grange, and took every precaution against any opening for
      the suspicion that she threw them in the way of her little sister-in-law.</p>
     <p>Nor had Flora forgotten the Ladies' Committee, or Cocksmoor. As to the Muses, they gave no
      trouble at all. Exemplary civilities about the chair passed between the Member's lady and Mrs.
      Ledwich, ending in Flora's insisting that priority in office should prevail, feeling that she
      could well afford to yield the post of honour, since anywhere she was the leader. She did not
      know how much more conformable the ladies had been ever since they had known Dr. Spencer's
      opinion; and yet he only believed that they were grateful for good advice, and went about
      among them, easy, good-natured, and utterly unconscious, that for him, sparkled Mrs. Ledwich's
      bugles, and for him waved every spinster's ribbon, from Miss Rich down to Miss Boulder.</p>
     <p>The point carried by their united influence was Charity Elwood's being sent for six months'
      finish at the Diocesan Training School; while a favourite pupil teacher from Abbotstoke took
      her place at Cocksmoor.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer looked at the Training School, and talked Mrs. Ledwich into magnanimous
      forgiveness of Mrs. Elwood. Cherry dreaded the ordeal, but she was willing to do anything that
      was thought right, and likely to make her fitter for her office.</p>

     <p>The tidings came at last, came when the heart-sickness of hope-deferred had faded

      declare that they would be almost glad to part with the hope that but kept alive despair.</p>
     <pb n="494"/>
     <p>The Christmas holidays had come to an end, and the home party were again alone, when early
      in the forenoon, there was a tap at the drawing-room door, and Dr. Spencer called, 'Ethel, can
      you come and speak to me?'</p>
     <p>Margaret started as if those gentle tones had been a thunderclap. Go! go, Ethel,' she said,
      'don't keep me waiting.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer stood in the hall with a newspaper in his hand. Ethel said, 'Is it?' and he made
      a sorrowful gesture.</p>
     <p>'Both?' she asked.</p>
     <p>'Both,' he repeated. 'The ship burnt—the boat lost.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel, come!' hoarsely called Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Take it,' said Dr. Spencer, putting the paper into her hand; 'I will wait.'</p>
     <p>She obeyed. She could not speak, but kneeling down by her sister, they read the paragraph
      together; Ethel, with one eye on the words, the other on Margaret.</p>
     <p>No doubt was left. Captain Gordon had returned, and this was his official report. The names
      of the missing stood below, and the list began thus— Lieutenant A. H. Ernescliffe. Mr. Charles
      Owen, Mate. Mr. Harry May, Midshipman. </p>
     <p>The Alcestis had taken fire on the 12th of April of the former year. There had been much
      admirable conduct, and the intrepid coolness of Mr. Ernescliffe was especially recorded. The
      boats had been put off without loss, but they were scantily provisioned, and the nearest land
      was far distant. For five days the boats kept together, then followed a night of storms, and,
      when morning dawned, the second cutter, under command of Mr. Ernescliffe, had disappeared.
      There could be no doubt that she had sunk, and the captain could only record his regrets for
      the loss the service had experienced in the three brave young officers and their gallant
      seamen. After infinite toil and suffering, the captain, with the other boats' crews, had
      reached Tahiti, whence they had made their way home.</p>
     <p>'O Margaret, Margaret!' cried Ethel.</p>
     <p>Margaret raised herself, and the colour came into her face. 'I did not write the letter!'
      she said.</p>
     <p>'What letter?' said Ethel, alarmed.</p>
     <p>'Richard prevented me. The letter that would have parted us. Now all is well.'</p>
     <p>'All is well, I know, if we could but feel it.'</p>
     <p>'He never had the pain. It is unbroken!' continued Margaret, her eyes brightening, but her
      breath, in long-drawn gasps that terrified Ethel into calling Dr. Spencer.</p>
     <pb n="495"/>
     <p>Mary was standing before him, with bloodless face and dilated eyes; but, as Ethel
      approached, she turned and rushed up-stairs.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer entered the drawing-room with Ethel, who tried to read his face as he saw
      Margaret—restored, as it seemed, to all her girlish bloom, and her eyes sparkling as they were
      lifted up, far beyond the present scene. Ethel had a moment's sense that his expression was as
      if he had seen a death-blow struck, but it was gone in a moment, as he gently shook Margaret
      by the hand, and spoke a word of greeting, as though to recall her.</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' she said, with her own grateful smile.</p>
     <p>'Where is your father?' he asked of Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Either at the hospital, or at Mr. Ramsden's,' said Ethel, with a ghastly suspicion, that he
      thought Margaret in a state to require him.</p>
     <p>'Papa!' said Margaret. 'If he were but here! But—ah! I had forgotten.'</p>
     <p>She turned aside her head, and hid her face. Dr. Spencer signed Ethel nearer to him. 'This
      is a more natural state,' he said. 'Dont be afraid for her. I will find your father, and bring
      him home.' Pressing her hand he departed.</p>
     <p>Margaret was weeping tranquilly—Ethel knelt down beside her, without daring at first to
      speak, but sending up intense mental prayers to Him, who alone could bear her or her dear
      father through their affliction. Then she ventured to take her hand, and Margaret returned the
      caress, but began to blame herself for the momentary selfishness that had allowed her
      brother's loss and her father's grief to have been forgotten in her own.—Ethel's "oh! no! no!"
      did not console her for this which seemed the most present sorrow, but the flow of tears was
      so gentle, that Ethel trusted that they were a relief. Ethel herself seemed only able to watch
      her, and to fear for her father, not to be able to think for herself.</p>
     <p>The front door opened, and they heard Dr. May's step hesitating in the hall, as if he could
      not bear to come in.</p>
     <p>'Go to him!' cried Margaret, wiping off her tears.</p>
     <p>Ethel stood a moment in the door-way, then sprang to him, and was clasped in his arms.</p>
     <p>'You know it?' he whispered.</p>
     <p>'Dr. Spencer told us. Did not you meet him?'</p>
     <p>'No. I read it at Bramshaw's office. How—' He could not say the words, but he looked towards
      the room, and wrung the hand he held.</p>
     <p>'Quiet. Like herself. Come.'</p>
     <p>He threw one arm round Ethel, and laid his hand on her head, 'How much there is to be
      thankful for!' he said, then advancing, he hung over Margaret, calling her his own poor
      darling.</p>
     <pb n="496"/>
     <p>'Papa, you must forgive me. You said, sending him to sea was giving him up.'</p>
     <p>'Did I. Well, Margaret, he did his duty. That is all we have to live for. Our yellow-haired
      laddie made a gallant sailor, and—'</p>
     <p>Tears choked his utterance—Margaret gently stroked his hand.</p>
     <p>'It falls hard on you, my poor girl,' he said.</p>
     <p>'No, papa,' said Margaret, 'I am content and thankful. He is spared pain and
      perplexity.'</p>
     <p>'You are right, I believe,' said Dr. May. 'He would have been grieved not to find you
      better.'</p>
     <p>'I ought to grieve for my own selfishness,' said Margaret. 'I cannot help it! I cannot be
      sorry the link is unbroken, and that he had not to turn to anyone else.'</p>
     <p>'He never would!' cried Dr. May, almost angrily.</p>
     <p>'I tried to think he ought,' said Margaret. 'His life would have been too dreary. But it is
      best as it is.'</p>
     <p>'It must be,' said the Doctor. 'Where are the rest, Ethel? Call them all down.'</p>
     <p>Poor Mary, Ethel felt as if she had neglected her! She found her hanging over the nursery
      fire, alternating with old nurse in fond reminiscences of Harry's old days, sometimes almost
      laughing at his pranks, then crying again, while Aubrey sat between them, drinking in each
      word.</p>
     <p>Blanche and Gertrude came from the school-room, where Miss Bracy seemed to have been
      occupying them, with much kindness and judgment. She came to the door to ask Ethel anxiously
      for the Doctor and Miss May, and looked so affectionate and sympathizing, that Ethel gave her
      a hearty kiss.</p>
     <p>'Dear Miss Ethel! if you can only let me help you.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Ethel with all her heart, and hurried away.</p>
     <p>Nothing was more in favour of Miss Bracy, than that there should be a hurry. Then she could
      be warm, and not morbid.</p>
     <p>Dr. May gathered his children round him, and took out the great Prayer-book. He read a Psalm
      and a prayer from the Burial Service, and the sentence for funerals at sea. Then he touched
      each of their heads, and, in short broken sentences, gave thanks for those still left to him,
      and for the blessed hope they could feel for those who were gone; and he prayed that they
      might so follow in their footsteps, as to come to the same Holy place, and in the meantime
      realize the Communion of Saints. Then they said the Lord's Prayer, he blessed them, and they
      arose.</p>
     <p>'Mary, my dear,' he said, 'you have a photograph.'</p>
     <p>She put the case into his hands, and ran away.</p>
     <pb n="497"/>
     <p>He went to the study, where he found Dr. Spencer awaiting him.</p>
     <p>'I am only come to know where I shall go for you.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, Spencer. Thank you for taking care of my poor girls.'</p>
     <p>'They took care of themselves. They have the secret of strength.'</p>
     <p>'They have—' He turned aside, and burst out, 'Oh, Spencer! you have been spared a great
      deal. If you missed a great deal of joy, you have missed almost as much sorrow!' And, covering
      his face, he let his grief have a free course.</p>
     <p>'Dick! dear old Dick, you must bear up. Think what treasures you have left.'</p>
     <p>'I do. I try to do so,' said poor Dr. May; 'but, Spencer, you never saw my yellow-haired
      laddie, with his lion look! He was the flower of them all! Not one of these other boys came
      near him in manliness, and with such a loving heart! An hour ago, I thought any certainty
      would be gain, but now I would give a lifetime to have back the hope that I might see my boy's
      face again! O, Spencer! this is the first time I could rejoice that his mother is not
      here!'</p>
     <p>'She would have been your comforter,' sighed his friend, as he felt his inability to contend
      with such grief.</p>
     <p>'There, I can be thankful,' Dr. May said, and he looked so. 'She has had her brave loving
      boy with her all this time, while we little thought—but there are others. My poor
      Margaret—'</p>
     <p>'Her patience <hi>must</hi> be blessed,' said Dr. Spencer. 'I think she will be better. Now
      that the suspense no longer preys on her, there will be more rest.'</p>
     <p>'Rest,' repeated Dr. May, supporting his head on his hand; and, looking up dreamily—' there
      remaineth a rest—'</p>
     <p>The large Bible lay beside him, on the table, and Dr. Spencer thought that he would find
      more rest there than in his words. Leaving him, therefore, his friend went to undertake his
      day's work, and learn, once more, in the anxious enquiries, and saddened countenances of the
      patients and their friends, how great an amount of love and sympathy that Dr. May had won by
      his own warmth of heart. The patients seemed to forget their complaints in sighs for their
      kind Doctors troubles; and the gouty Mayor of Stoneborough kept Dr. Spencer half-an-hour to
      listen to his recollections of the bright-faced boy's droll tricks, and then to the praises of
      the whole May family, and especially of the mother.</p>
     <p>Poor Dr. Spencer! he heard her accident described so many times in the course of the day,
      that his visits were one course of shrinking and suffering; and his only satisfaction was in
      knowing how his friend would be cheered, by hearing of the universal feeling for him and his
      children.</p>
     <pb n="498"/>
     <p>Ethel wrote letters to her brothers; and Dr. May added a few lines, begging Richard to come
      home, if only for a few days. Margaret would not be denied writing to Hector Ernescliffe,
      though she cried over her letter so much, that her father could almost have taken her pen
      away; but she said it did her good.</p>
     <p>When Flora came in the afternoon, Ethel was able to leave Margaret to her, and attend to
      Mary, with whom Miss Bracy's kindness had been inefficacious. If she was cheered for a few
      minutes, some association, either with the past, or the vanished future, soon set her off
      sobbing again. 'If I only knew where dear, dear Harry is lying,' she sobbed, 'and that it had
      not been very bad indeed, I could bear it better.'</p>
     <p>The ghastly uncertainty was too terrible for Ethel to have borne to contemplate it. She knew
      that it would haunt their pillows, and she was trying to nerve herself by faith.</p>
     <p>'Mary,' she said, 'that is the worst; but, after all, God willed that we should not know. We
      must bear it like His good children. It makes no difference to them now—'</p>
     <p>'I know,' said Mary, trying to check her sobs.</p>
     <p>'And, you know, we are all in the same keeping. The sea is a glorious great pure thing, you
      know, that man cannot hurt or defile. It seems, to me,' said Ethel, looking up, 'as if resting
      there was like being buried in our Baptism-tide over again, till the great new Birth. It must
      be the next best place to a Churchyard. Any where, they are as safe as among the daisies in
      our own Cloister.</p>
     <p>'Say it again—what you said about the sea,' said Mary, more comforted than if Ethel had been
      talking <hi>down</hi> to her.</p>
     <p>By-and-by, Ethel discovered that the sharpest trouble to the fond simple girl, was the
      deprivation of her precious photograph. It was like losing Harry over again, to go to bed
      without it, though she would not for the world seem to grudge it to her father.</p>
     <p>Ethel found an opportunity of telling him of this distress, and it almost made him smile.
      'Poor Mary,' he said, 'is she so fond of it? It is rather a libel than a likeness.'</p>
     <p>'Don't say so to her, pray, papa. It is all the world to her. Three strokes on paper would
      have been the same, if they had been called by his name.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; a loving heart has eyes of its own, and she is a dear good girl!'</p>
     <p>He did not forget to restore the treasure with gratitude proportionate to what the loan had
      cost Mary. With a trembling voice, she proffered it to him for the whole day, and every day,
      if she might only have it at night; and she even looked blank when he did not accept the
      proposal.</p>
     <pb n="499"/>
     <p>'It is exactly like—' said she.</p>
     <p>'It can't help being so, in a certain sense,' he answered kindly, 'but after all, Mary dear,
      he did not pout out his chin in that way.'</p>
     <p>Mary was somewhat mortified, but she valued her photograph more than ever, because no one
      else would admire it, except Daisy, whom she had taught to regard it with unrivalled
      veneration.</p>
     <p>A letter soon arrived from Captain Gordon, giving a fuller account of the loss of his ship,
      and of the conduct of his Officers, speaking in the highest terms of Alan Ernescliffe, for
      whom he said he mourned as for his own son, and, with scarcely less warmth, of Harry,
      mentioning the high esteem all had felt for the boy, and the good effect which the influence
      of his high and truthful spirit had produced on the other youngsters, who keenly regretted
      him.</p>
     <p>Captain Gordon added that the will of the late Captain Ernescliffe had made him guardian of
      his sons, and that he believed poor Alan had died intestate. He should therefore take upon
      himself the charge of young Hector, and he warmly thanked Dr. May and his family for all the
      kindness that the lad had received.</p>
     <p>Though the loss of poor Hector's visits was regretted, it was, on the whole, a comforting
      letter, and would give still more comfort in future time.</p>
     <p>Richard contrived to come home through Oxford and see Norman, whom he found calm, and almost
      relieved by the cessation from suspense; not inclined, as his father had feared, to drown
      sorrow in labour, but regarding his grief as an additional call to devote himself to
      ministerial work. In fact, the blow had fallen when he first heard the rumour of danger, and
      could not recur with the same force.</p>
     <p>Richard was surprised to find that Margaret was less cast down than he could have dared to
      hope. It did not seem like an affliction to her. Her countenance wore the same gentle smile,
      and she was as ready to participate in all that passed, finding sympathy for the little
      pleasures of Aubrey and Gertrude, and delighting in Flora's baby; as well as going over
      Cocksmoor politics with a clearness and accuracy that astonished him, and asking questions
      about his parish and occupations, so as fully to enjoy his short visit, which she truly called
      the greatest possible treat.</p>
     <p>If it had not been for the momentary consternation that she had seen upon Dr. Spencer's
      face, Ethel would have been perfectly satisfied; but she could not help sometimes entertaining
      a dim fancy that this composure came from a sense that she was too near Alan to mourn for him.
      Could it be true that her frame was more wasted, that there was less capability of exertion,
      that her hours
      <pb n="500"/> became later in the morning, and that her nights were more wakeful? Would she
      fade away? Ethel longed to know what her father thought, but she could neither bear to inspire
      him with the apprehension, nor to ask Dr. Spencer's opinion, lest she should be confirmed in
      her own.</p>
     <p>The present affliction altered Dr. May more visibly than the death of his wife, perhaps,
      because there was not the same need of exertion. If he often rose high in faith and
      resignation, he would also sink very low under the sense of bereavement and disappointment.
      Though Richard was his stay, and Norman his pride, there was something in Harry more congenial
      to his own temper, and he could not but be bowed down by the ruin of such bright hopes. With
      all his real submission, he was weak, and gave way to outbursts of grief, for which he blamed
      himself as unthankful; and his whole demeanour was so saddened and depressed, that Ethel and
      Dr. Spencer consulted mournfully over him, whenever they walked to Cocksmoor together.</p>
     <p>This was not as often as usual, though the walls of the school were rising, for Dr. Spencer
      had taken a large share of his friend's work for the present, and both physicians were much
      occupied by the condition of Mr. Ramsden, who was fast sinking, and, for some weeks, seemed
      only kept alive by their skill. The struggle ended at last, and his forty years' cure of
      Stoneborough was closed. It made Dr. May very sad—his affections had tendrils for any thing
      that he had known from boyhood; and though he had often spoken strong words of the Vicar, he
      now sat sorrowfully moralizing, and making excuses. 'People in former times had not so high an
      estimate of pastoral duty—poor Mr. Ramsden had not much education—he was already old when
      better times came in— he might have done better in a less difficult parish with better laity
      to support him, etc.' Yet after all, he exclaimed with one of his impatient gestures,
      'Better have my Harry's seventeen years than his sixty-seven!'</p>
     <p>'Better improve a talent, than lay it by!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Hush! Ethel. How do you know what he may have done? If he acted up to his own standard, he
      did more than most of us.'</p>
     <p>'Which is best,' said Ethel, 'a high standard not acted up to, or a lower one
      fulfilled?'</p>
     <p>'I think it depends on the will,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Some people are angry with those whose example would shew that there is a higher standard,'
      said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'And,' said Margaret, 'some who have the high one set before them, content themselves with
      knowing that it cannot be fully attained, and will not try.'</p>
     <pb n="501"/>
     <p>'The standard is the effect of early impression,' said Dr. May. 'I should be very sorry to
      think it could not be raised.'</p>
     <p>'Faithful in a little—' said Ethel. 'I suppose all good people's standard is always going
      higher.'</p>
     <p>'As they comprehend more of absolute perfection,' said Margaret.</p>

     <p>A disinclination for exertion or going into public hung upon Dr. May, but he was
      obliged to rouse himself to attend the Town Council meeting, which was held a few days after
      the Vicar's funeral, to decide on the next appointment. If it had depended on himself alone,
      his choice would have been Mr. Edward Wilmot, whom the death of his good old father had
      uprooted from Settlesham; and the girls had much hope, but he was too much out of spirits to
      be sanguine. He said that he should only hear a great deal of offensive stuff from Tomkins the
      brewer; and that, in the desire to displease nobody, the votes should settle down on some
      nonentity, was the best which was likely to happen. Thus, grumbling, he set off, and his
      daughters watched anxiously for his return. They saw him come through the garden with a quick,
      light step, that made them augur well, and he entered the room with the corners of his mouth
      turning up. 'I see,' said Ethel, 'it is all right.'</p>
     <p>'They were going to have made a very absurd choice.'</p>
     <p>'But you prevented it? Who was it?'</p>
     <p>'Ah! I told you Master Ritchie was turning out a popular preacher.'</p>
     <p>'You don't mean that they chose Richard!' cried Margaret, breathlessly.</p>
     <pb n="502"/>
     <p>'As sure as my name is Dick May, they did, every man of them, except Tomkins, and even he
      held his tongue; I did not think it of them,' said the Doctor, almost overcome; 'but there is
      much more goodness of heart in the world than one gives it credit for.'</p>
     <p>And good Dr. May was not one to give the least credit for all that was like himself.</p>
     <p>'But it was Richard's own doing,' he continued. 'Those sermons made a great impression, and
      they love the boy, because he has grown up among them. The old Mayor waddled up to me, as I
      came in, telling me that they had been talking it over, and they were unanimously agreed that
      they could not have a parson they should like better than Mr. Richard.'</p>
     <p>'Good old Mr. Doddesley! I can see him!' cried Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I expected it so little, that I thought he meant some Richards; but no, he said Mr. Richard
      May, if he had nothing better in view —they liked him, and knew he was a very steady, good
      young gentleman, and if he took after his fathers that went before him— and they thought we
      might like to have him settled near!'</p>
     <p>'How very kind!' said Margaret, as the tears came. 'We shall love our own townsfolk better
      than ever!'</p>
     <p>'I always told you so, if you would but believe it. They have warm, sound hearts, every one
      of them! I declare, I did not know which way to look, I was so sorry to disappoint them.'</p>
     <p>'Disappoint them!' cried Margaret, in consternation.</p>
     <p>'I was thinking,' said Ethel. 'I do not believe Richard would think himself equal to this
      place in such a state as it is. He is so diffident.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Dr. May, 'if he were ten or twelve years older, it would be another thing; but
      here, where everything is to be done, he would not bring weight or force enough. He would only
      work himself to death, for individuals, without going to the root. Margaret, my darling, I am
      very sorry to have disappointed you so much—it would have been as great a pleasure as we could
      have had in this world to have the lad here—'</p>
     <p>'And Cocksmoor,' sighed Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I shall be grateful all my life to those good people for thinking of it,' continued the
      Doctor; 'but look you here, it was my business to get the best man chosen in my power and,
      though as to goodness, I believe the dear Ritchie has not many equals; I don't think we can
      conscientiously say he would be, at present, the best Vicar for Stoneborough.'</p>
     <p>Ethel would not say no, for fear she should pain Margaret. 'Besides,' continued Dr. May,
      'after having staved off the sale of the presentation as a sin, it would hardly have been
      handsome to have
      <pb n="503"/> let my own son profit by it. It would have seemed as if we had our private ends,
      when Richard helped poor old Mr. Ramsden.'</p>
     <p>Margaret owned this, and Ethel said Richard would be glad to be spared the refusal.</p>
     <p>'I was sure of it. The poor fellow would have been perplexed between the right and
      consideration for us. A Vicar here ought to carry things with a high hand, and that is hardest
      to do at a man's own home, especially for a quiet lad like him.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, papa, it was quite right,' said Margaret, recovering herself;' it has spared Richard a
      great deal.'</p>
     <p>'But are we to have Mr. Wilmot?' said Ethel. 'Think of our not having heard!'</p>
     <p>'Aye. If they would not have had Wilmot, or a man of his calibre, perhaps I might have let
      them offer it to Richard. I almost wish I had.—With help, and Ethel—'</p>
     <p>'No, no! papa,' said Margaret. 'You are making me angry with myself for my folly. It is much
      better for Richard himself, and for us all, as well as the town. Think how long we have wished
      for Mr. Wilmot!'</p>
     <p>'He will be in time for the opening of Cocksmoor school!' cried Ethel. 'How did you manage
      it?'</p>
     <p>'I did not manage at all,' said the Doctor. 'I told them exactly my mind, that Richard was
      not old enough for such arduous work; and though no words could tell how obliged I was, if
      they asked me who was the best man for it I knew, I should say Edward Wilmot, and I thought he
      deserved something from us, for the work he did gratis, when he was second master. Tomkins
      growled a little, but, fortunately, no one was prepared with another proposal, so they all
      came round, and the Mayor is to write by this evening's post, and so shall I. If we could only
      have given Richard a dozen more years!'</p>
     <p>Margaret was somewhat comforted to find that the sacrifice had cost her father a good deal;
      she was always slightly jealous for Richard, and now that Alan was gone, she clung to him more
      than ever. His soft calm manner supported her more than any other human comforter, and she
      always yearned after him when absent, more than for all the other brothers; but her father's
      decision had been too high-minded for her to dare to wish it recalled, and she could not but
      own that Richard would have had to undergo more toil and annoyance, than perhaps his health
      would have endured.</p>
     <p>Flora had discontinued comments to her sisters, on her father's proceedings, finding that
      observations mortified Margaret, and did not tend to peace with Ethel; but she told her
      husband that she did not regret it much, for Richard would have exhausted his own income,
      <pb n="504"/> and his father's likewise, in paying Curates, and raising funds for charities.
      She scarcely expected Mr. Edward Wilmot to accept the offer, aware as he was, of the many
      disadvantages he should have to contend with, and unsuccessful as he had been in dealing with
      the Ladies' Committee.</p>
     <p>However, Mr. Wilmot signified his thankful acceptance, and, in due time, his familiar tap
      was heard at the drawing-room door, at tea-time, as if he had just returned after the
      holidays. He was most gladly welcomed, and soon was installed in his own place, with his
      god-daughter, Mary, blushing with pleasure at pouring out his coffee.</p>
     <p>'Well, Ethel, how is Cocksmoor? How like old times!'</p>
     <p>'Oh!' cried Ethel, 'we are so glad you will see the beginning of the school!'</p>
     <p>'I hear you are finishing Cherry Elwood, too.'</p>
     <p>'Much against Ethel's will,' said Margaret; 'but we thought Cherry not easily spoilt. And
      Whitford school seems to be in very good order. Dr. Spencer went and had an inspection of it,
      and conferred with all the authorities.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! we have a jewel of a parishioner for you,' said Dr. May. 'I have some hopes of
      Stoneborough now.'</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot did not look too hopeful, but he smiled, and asked after Granny Hall, and the
      children.</p>
     <p>'Polly grew up quite civilized,' said Ethel. 'She lives at Whitford, with some very
      respectable people, and sends Granny presents, which make her merrier than ever. Last time it
      was a bonnet, and Jenny persuaded her to go to Church in it, though, she said, what she called
      the moon of it, was too small.'</p>
     <p>'How do the people go on?'</p>
     <p>'I cannot say much for them. It is disheartening. We really have done nothing. So very few
      go to Church regularly.</p>
     <p>'None at all went in my time,' said Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>'Elwood always goes,' said Mary, 'and Taylor; yes, and Sam Hall, very often, and many of the
      women, in the evening, because they like to walk home with the children.'</p>
     <p>'The children? the Sunday scholars?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! everyone, that is big enough, comes to school now, here, on Sunday. If only the
      teaching were better—'</p>
     <p>'Have you sent out any more pupils to service?'</p>
     <p>'Not many. There is Willie Brown, trying to be Dr. Spencer's little groom,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'But I am afraid it will take a great deal of the Doctor's patience to train him,' added
      Margaret.</p>
     <p>'It is hard,' said Dr. May. 'He did it purely to oblige Ethel;
      <pb n="505"/> and, I tell her, when he lames the pony, I shall expect her to buy another for
      him, out of the Cocksmoor funds.'</p>
     <p>Ethel and Mary broke out in a chorus of defence of Willie Brown.</p>
     <p>'There was Ben Wheeler,' said Mary, 'who went to work in the quarries; and the men could not
      teach him to say bad words, because the young ladies told him not.'</p>
     <p>'The young ladies have not quite done nothing,' said Dr. May, smiling.</p>
     <p>'These are only little stray things, and Cherry has done the chief of them,' said Ethel.
      'Oh! it is grievously bad still,' she added, sighing. 'Such want of truth, such ungoverned
      tongues and tampers, such godlessness altogether! It is only surface-work, taming the children
      at school, while they have such homes; and their parents—even if they do come where they might
      learn better, are always liable to be upset, as they call it—turned out of their places in
      Church, and they will not run the chance.'</p>
     <p>'The Church must come to them,' said Mr. Wilmot. 'Could the school be made fit to be
      licensed for Service.'</p>
     <p>'Ask our architect? said Dr. May. 'There can be little doubt.'</p>
     <p>'I have been settling that I must have a Curate specially for Cocksmoor,' said Mr. Wilmot.
      'Can you tell me of one, Ethel—or perhaps Margaret could?'</p>
     <p>Margaret could only smile faintly, for her heart was beating.</p>
     <p>'Seriously,' said Mr. Wilmot, turning to Dr. May, 'do you think Richard would come and help
      us here?'</p>
     <p>'This seems to be his destiny,' said the Doctor, smiling, 'only it would not be fair to tell
      you, lest you should be jealous—that the Town Council had a great mind for him.'</p>
     <p>The matter was explained, and Mr. Wilmot was a great deal more struck by Dr. May's conduct,
      than the good Doctor thought it deserved. Everyone was only too glad that Richard should come
      as Cocksmoor Curate; and, though the stipend was very small— since Mr. Wilmot meant to have
      other assistance—yet, by living at home, it might be feasible.</p>
     <p>Margaret's last words that night to Ethel were, 'The last wish I had dared to make is
      granted!'</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot wrote to Richard, who joyfully accepted his proposal, and engaged to come home as
      soon as his present Rector could find a substitute.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer was delighted, and, it appeared, had already had a view to such possibilities in
      designing the plan of the school.</p>
     <p>The first good effect of Mr. Wilmot's coming was, that Dr. Spencer was cured of the vagrant
      habits of going to Church at Abbotstoke or Fordholm, that had greatly concerned his friend,
      Dr. May, who could
      <pb n="506"/> never get any answer from him except that he was not a Town Councillor, and, as
      to example, it was no way to set that to sleep through the sermon.</p>
     <p>To say that Dr. May never slept under the new dynasty would be an over-statement, but
      slumber certainly prevailed in the Minster to a far less degree than formerly. One cause might
      be that it was not shut up unaired from one Sunday to another, but that the chime of the bells
      was no longer an extraordinary sound on a week-day. It was at first pronounced that time could
      not be found for going to Church on week-days without neglecting other things, but Mary, who
      had lately sat very loose to the school-room, began gradually to slip down to Church whenever
      the Service was neither too early nor too late; and Gertrude was often found trotting by her
      side—going to mamma, as the little Daisy called it, from some confusion between the Church and
      the Cloister, which Ethel was in no hurry to disturb.</p>
     <p>Lectures in Lent filled the Church a good deal, as much perhaps from the novelty as from
      better motives, and altogether there was a renewal of energy in parish work. The poor had
      become so little accustomed to pastoral care, that the doctors and the district visitors were
      obliged to report cases of sickness to the Clergy, and vainly tried to rouse the people to
      send of their own accord. However, the better leaven began to work, and, of course, there was
      a ferment, though less violent than Ethel had expected.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot set more cautiously to work than he had done in his younger days, and did not
      attack prejudices so openly, and he had an admirable assistant in Dr. Spencer. Everyone
      respected the opinion of the travelled Doctor, and he had a courteous clever process of the
      reduction to the absurd, which seldom failed to tell, while it never gave offence. As to the
      Ladies' Committee, though there had been expressions of dismay, when the tidings of the
      appointment first went abroad, not one of the whole "Aonian choir" liked to dissent from Dr.
      Spencer, and he talked them over, individually, into a most conformable state, merely by
      taking their compliance for granted, and showing that he deemed it only the natural state of
      things, that the Vicar should reign over the charities of the place.</p>
     <p>The Committee was not dissolved—that would have been an act of violence—but it was
      henceforth subject to Mr. Wilmot, and he and his Curates undertook the religious instruction
      in the week, and chose the books—a state of affairs brought about with so much quietness, that
      Ethel knew not whether Flora, Dr. Spencer, or Mr. Wilmot, had been the chief mover.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Ledwich was made treasurer of a new coal club, and Miss Rich keeper of the lending
      library, occupations which delighted them greatly; and Ethel was surprised to find how much
      unity of
      <pb n="507"/> action was springing up, now that the period was over, of each "doing right in
      her own eyes."</p>
     <p>'In fact,' said Dr. Spencer, 'when women have enough to do, they are perfectly
      tractable.'</p>
     <p>The Cocksmoor accounts were Ethel's chief anxiety. It seemed as if now there might be a
      school-house, but with little income to depend upon, since poor Alan Ernescliffe's annual £10
      was at an end. However, Dr. May leant over her as she was puzzling over her pounds shillings
      and pence, and laid a cheque upon her desk. She looked up in his face. 'We must make Cocksmoor
      Harry's heir,' he said.</p>
     <p>By-and-by it appeared that Cocksmoor was not out of Hector Ernescliffe's mind. The boy's
      letters to Margaret had been brief, matter of fact, and discouraging, as long as the half-year
      lasted, and there was not much to be gathered about him from Tom, on his return for the Easter
      holidays, but soon poor Hector wrote a long dismal letter to Margaret.</p>
     <p>Captain Gordon had taken him to Maplewood, where the recollection of his brother, and the
      happy hopes with which they had taken possession, came thronging upon him. The house was
      forlorn, and the corner that had been unpacked for their reception, was as dreary a contrast
      to the bright home at Stoneborough, as was the dry, stern Captain, to the fatherly
      warm-hearted Doctor. Poor Hector had little or nothing to do, and the pleasure of possession
      had not come yet; he had no companion of his own age, and bashfulness made him shrink with
      dislike from introduction to his tenants and neighbours.</p>
     <p>There was not an entertaining book in the house, he declared, and the Captain snubbed him,
      if he bought anything he cared to read.—The Captain was always at him to read musty old
      improving books, and talking about the position he would occupy! The evenings were altogether
      unbearable, and if it were not for rabbit shooting now, and the half-year soon beginning
      again, Hector declared he should be ready to cut and run, and leave Captain Gordon and
      Maplewood to each other—and very well matched too! He was nearly in a state of mind to imitate
      that unprecedented boy, who wrote a letter to the <hi>Times</hi> , complaining of extra
      weeks.</p>
     <p>As to Cocksmoor, Ethel must not think it forgotten; he had spoken to the Captain about it,
      and the old wooden-head had gone and answered that it was not incumbent on him, that Cocksmoor
      had no claims upon him, and he could not make it up out of his allowance; for the old fellow
      would not give him a farthing more than he had before, and had said that was too much.</p>
     <p>There was a great blur over the words "wooden-head," as if
      <pb n="508"/> Hector had known that Margaret would disapprove, and had tried to scratch it
      out. She wrote all the consolation in her power, and exhorted him to patience, apparently
      without much effect. She would not shew his subsequent letters, and the reading and answering
      them fatigued her so much, that Hector's writing was an unwelcome sight at Stoneborough. Each
      letter, as Ethel said, seemed so much taken out of her, and she begged her not to think about
      them.</p>
     <p>'Nothing can do me much good, or harm, now,' said Margaret; and seeing Ethel's anxious
      looks, 'Is it not my greatest comfort that Hector can still treat me as his sister, or, if I
      can only be of any use in keeping him patient? Only think of the danger of a boy, in his
      situation, being left without sympathy!'</p>
     <p>There was nothing more to be said. They all felt it was good for them that the building at
      Cocksmoor gave full occupation to thoughts, and conversation; indeed, Tom declared they never
      walked in any other direction, nor talked of anything else, and that without Hector, or George
      Rivers, he had nobody to speak to! However, he was a good deal tranquilized by an introduction
      to Dr. Spencer's laboratory, where he compounded mixtures that Dr. Spencer promised should do
      no more harm than was reasonable, to himself, or any one else. Ethel suspected that, if Tom
      had chanced to singe his eyebrows, his friend would not have regretted a blight to his nascent
      coxcombry, but he was far too careful of his own beauty to do any such thing.</p>
     <p>Richard was set at liberty just before Easter, and came home to his new charge. He was aware
      of what had taken place, and heartily grateful for the part his father had taken. To work at
      Cocksmoor, under Mr. Wilmot, and to live at home, was felicity; and he fitted at once into his
      old place, and resumed all the little home services for which he had been always famed. Ethel
      was certain that Margaret was content, when she saw her brother bending over her, and the
      sense of reliance and security that the presence of the silent Richard imparted to the whole
      family, was something very peculiar, especially as they were so much more active and
      demonstrative than he was.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot put him at once in charge of the hamlet. The inhabitants were still a hard, rude,
      unpromising race, and there were many flagrant evils amongst them, but the last few years had
      not been without some effect—some were less obdurate, a few really touched, and, almost all,
      glad of instruction for their children. If Ethel's perseverance had done nothing else, it had,
      at least, been a witness, and her immediate scholars shewed the influence of her lessons.</p>

     <p>In the meantime, the Session of parliament had begun, and the Rivers' party had,
      since February, inhabited Park Lane. Meta had looked pale and pensive, as she bade her
      friends, at Stoneborough, good-bye; but only betrayed that she had rather have staid at home,
      by promising herself great enjoyment in meeting them again at Easter.</p>
     <p>Flora was, on the other hand, in the state of calm patronage, that betokened perfect
      satisfaction. She promised wonders for Miss Bracy's sisters—talked of inviting Mary and
      Blanche to see sights and take lessons; and undertook to send all the apparatus needed by
      Cocksmoor school; and she did, accordingly, send down so many wonderful articles, that Curate
      and school-mistress were both frightened; Mrs. Taylor thought the easels were new-fashioned
      instruments of torture; and Ethel found herself in a condition to be liberal to Stoneborough
      National School.</p>
     <p>Flora was a capital correspondent, and made it her business to keep Margaret amused, so that
      the home-party were well informed of the doings of each of her days—and very clever her
      descriptions were. She had given herself a dispensation from general society until after
      Easter; but, in the meantime, both she and Meta seemed to find great enjoyment in country
      rides and drives, and in quiet little dinners at home, to George's agreeable political
      friends. With the help of two such ladies as Mrs. and Miss Rivers, Ethel could imagine
      George's house pleasant enough to attract clever people; but she was surprised to find how
      full her sister's letters were of political news.</p>
     <p>It was a period when great interests were in agitation; and the details of London talk and
      opinions were extremely welcome. Dr. Spencer used to come in to ask after 'Mrs. Rivers's
      Intelligencer;' and, when he heard the lucid statements, would say, she ought to have been a
      'special correspondent.' And her father
      <pb n="510"/> declared that her news made him twice as welcome to his patients; but her
      cleverest sentences always were prefaced with "George says," or "George thinks," in a manner
      that made her appear merely the dutiful echo of his sentiments.</p>
     <p>In an early letter, Flora mentioned how she had been reminded of poor Harry, by finding Miss
      Walkinghame's card. That lady lived with her mother at Richmond, and, on returning the visit,
      Flora was warmly welcomed by the kind old Lady Walkinghame, who insisted on her bringing her
      baby and spending a long day. The sisters-in-law had been enchanted with Miss Walkinghame,
      whose manners, wrote Flora, certainly merited papa's encomium.</p>
     <p>On the promised "long day," they found an unexpected addition to the party, Sir Henry
      Walkinghame, who had newly returned from the continent. "A fine-looking, agreeable man, about
      five-and-thirty," Flora described him, "very lively and entertaining. He talked a great deal
      of Dr. Spencer, and of the life in the caves at Thebes; and he asked me whether that
      unfortunate place, Cocksmoor, did not owe a great deal to me, or to one of my sisters. I left
      Meta to tell him that story, and they became very sociable over it."</p>
     <p>A day or two after—"Sir Henry Walkinghame has been dining with us. He has a very good voice,
      and we had some delightful music in the evening."</p>
     <p>By-and-by, Sir Henry was the second cavalier, when they went to an Oratorio, and Meta's
      letter overflowed with the descriptions she had heard from him of Italian Church music. He
      always went to Rome for Easter, and had been going as usual, this spring, but he lingered,
      and, for once, remained in England, where he had only intended to spend a few days on
      necessary business.</p>
     <p>The Easter recess was not spent at the Grange, but at Lady Leonora's pretty house in Surrey.
      She had invited the party in so pressing a manner that Flora did not think it right to
      decline. Meta expressed some disappointment at missing Easter among her school-children, but
      she said a great deal about the primroses and the green corn-fields, and nightingales—all
      which Ethel would have set down to her trick of universal content, if it had not appeared that
      Sir Henry was there too, and shared in all the delicious rides.</p>
     <p>'What would Ethel say,' wrote Flora, 'to have our little Meta as Lady of the Manor at
      Cocksmoor? He has begun to talk about Drydale, and there are various suspicious circumstances
      that Lady Leonora marks with the eyes of a discreet dowager. It was edifying to see how, from
      smiles, we came to looks, and by-and-by to confidential talks, which have made her entirely
      forgive me for having so many tall brothers. Poor dear old Mr. Rivers! Lady Leonora owns that
      it was the best thing possible for that sweet girl
      <pb n="511"/> that he did not live any longer to keep her in seclusion; it is so delightful to
      see her appreciated as she deserves, and with her beauty and fortune, she might make any
      choice she pleases. In fact, I believe Lady Leonora would like to look still higher for her,
      but this would be mere ambition, and we should be far better satisfied with such a connection
      as this, founded on mutual and increasing esteem, with a man so well suited to her, and fixing
      her so close to us. You must not, however, launch out into an ocean of possibilities, for the
      good aunt has only infected me with the castle-building propensities of chaperons, and Meta is
      perfectly unconscious, looking on him as too hopelessly middle-aged, to entertain any such
      evil designs, avowing freely that she likes him, and treating him very nearly as she does
      papa. It is my business to keep "our aunt," who, between ourselves, has, below the surface,
      the vulgarity of nature that high-breeding cannot eradicate, from startling the little
      humming-bird, before the net has been properly twined round her bright little heart. As far as
      I can see, he is much smitten, but very cautious in his approaches, and he is wise."</p>
     <p>Margaret did not know what dismay she conveyed, as she handed this letter to her sister.
      There was no rest for Ethel till she could be alone with her father. 'Could nothing prevent
      it? Could not Flora be told of Mr. Rivers' wishes?' she asked.</p>
     <p>'His wishes would have lain this way.'</p>
     <p>'I do not know that.'</p>
     <p>'It is no concern of ours. There is nothing objectionable here, and though I can't say it is
      not a disappointment, it ought not to be. The long and short of it is, that I never ought to
      have told you anything about it.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Norman!'</p>
     <p>'Absurd! The lad is hardly one-and-twenty. Very few marry a first love.' (Ah, Ethel!) 'Poor
      old Rivers only mentioned it as a refuge from fortune-hunters, and it stands to reason that he
      would have preferred this. Any way, it is awkward for a man with empty pockets to marry an
      heiress, and it is wholesomer for him to work for his living. Better that it should be out of
      his head at once, if it were there at all. I trust it was all our fancy. I would not have him
      grieved now for worlds, when his heart is sore.'</p>
     <p>'Somehow,' said Ethel, 'though he is depressed and silent, I like it better than I did last
      Christmas.'</p>
     <p>'Of course, when we were laughing out of the bitterness of our hearts,' said Dr. May,
      sighing. 'It is a luxury to let oneself alone to be sorrowful.'</p>
     <p>Ethel did not know whether she desired a <hi>tête à tête</hi> with Norman or not. She was
      aware that he had seen Flora's letter, and she did
      <pb n="512"/> not believe that he would ever mention the hopes that must have been dashed by
      it; or, if he should do so, how could she ever guard her father's secret? At least, she had
      the comfort of recognizing the accustomed Norman in his manner, low-spirited, indeed, and more
      than ever dreamy and melancholy, but not in the unnatural and excited state that had made her
      unhappy about him. She could not help telling Dr. Spencer, that this was much more the real
      brother.</p>
     <p>'I dare say,' was the answer, not quite satisfactory in tone.</p>
     <p>'I thought you would like it better.'</p>
     <p>'Truth is better than fiction, certainly. But I am afraid he has a tendency to morbid
      self-contemplation, and you ought to shake him out of it.'</p>
     <p>'What is the difference between self-contemplation and self-examination?'</p>
     <p>'The difference between your brother and yourself. Ah! you think that no answer. Will you
      have a medical simile? Self-examination notes the symptoms and combats them;
      self-contemplation, does as I did when I was unstrung by that illness at Poonshedagore, and
      was always feeling my own pulse. It dwells on them, and perpetually deplores itself. Oh dear!
      this is no better—what a wretch I am. It is always studying its deformities in a moral
      looking-glass.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I think poor Norman does that, but I thought it right and humble.'</p>
     <p>'The humility of a self-conscious mind. It is the very reverse of your father, who is the
      most really humble man in existence.'</p>
     <p>'Do you call self-consciousness a fault?'</p>
     <p>'No. I call it a misfortune. In the vain, it leads to prudent vanity; in the good, to a
      painful effort of humility.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think I quite understand what it is.</p>
     <p>'No, and you have so much of your father in you, that you never will. But take care of your
      brother, and don't let his brains work.'</p>
     <p>How Ethel was to take care of him she did not know; she could only keep a heedful eye on
      him, and rejoice when he took Tom out for a long walk—a companion certainly not likely to
      promote the working of the brain—but though it was in the opposite direction to Cocksmoor, Tom
      came home desperately cross, snubbed Gertrude, and fagged Aubrey; but, then, as Blanche
      observed, perhaps that was only because his trowsers were splashed.</p>
     <p>In her next solitary walk to Cocksmoor, Norman joined Ethel. She was gratified, but she
      could not think of one safe word worth saying to him, and for a mile they preserved an
      absolute silence, until he first began, 'Ethel, I have been thinking—'</p>
     <pb n="513"/>
     <p>'That you have!' said she, between hope and dread, and the thrill of being again treated as
      his friend.</p>
     <p>'I want to consult you. Don't you think now that Richard is settled at home, and if Tom will
      study medicine, that I could be spared.'</p>
     <p>'Spared!' exclaimed Ethel. 'You are not much at home.'</p>
     <p>'I meant more than my present absences. It is my earnest wish—' he paused, and the
      continuation took her by surprise. 'Do you think it would give my father too much pain to part
      with me as a Missionary to New Zealand?'</p>
     <p>She could only gaze at him in mute amazement.</p>
     <p>'Do you think he could bear it?' said Norman, hastily.</p>
     <p>'He would consent,' she replied. 'O Norman, it is the most glorious thing man can do! How I
      wish I could go with you.'</p>
     <p>'Your mission is here,' said Norman, affectionately.</p>
     <p>'I know it is—I am contented with it,' said Ethel; 'but oh! Norman, after all our talks
      about races and gifts, you have found the more excellent way.'</p>
     <p>'Hush! Charity finds room at home, and mine are not such unmixed motives as yours.'</p>
     <p>She made a sound of inquiry.</p>
     <p>'I cannot tell you all. Some you <hi>shall</hi> hear. I am weary of this feverish life of
      competition and controversy—'</p>
     <p>'I thought you were so happy with your Fellowship. I thought Oxford was your delight.'</p>
     <p>'She will always be nearer my heart than any place, save this. It is not her fault that I am
      not like the simple and dutiful, who are not fretted or perplexed.'</p>
     <p>'Perplexed?' repeated Ethel.</p>
     <p>'It is not so now,' he replied. 'God forbid! But where better men have been led astray, I
      have been bewildered; till, Ethel, I have felt as if the ground were slipping from beneath my
      feet, and I have only been able to hide my eyes, and entreat that I might know the truth.'</p>
     <p>'You knew it!' said Ethel, looking pale, and gazing searchingly at him.</p>
     <p>'I did, I <hi>do;</hi> but it was a time of misery when, for my presumption, I suppose, I
      was allowed to doubt whether it were the truth.'</p>
     <p>Ethel recoiled, but came nearer, saying, very low, 'It is past.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, thank Him who is Truth. You all saved me, though you did not know it.'</p>
     <p>'When was this?' she asked, timidly.</p>
     <p>'The worst time was before the Long Vacation. They told me I ought to read this book, and
      that. Harvey Anderson used to come
      <pb n="514"/> primed with arguments. I could always overthrow them, but when I came to glory
      in doing so, perhaps I prayed less. Any way, they left a sting. It might be, that I doubted my
      own sincerity, from knowing that I had got to argue, chiefly because I liked to be looked on
      as a champion.'</p>
     <p>Ethel saw the truth of what her friend had said of the morbid habit of
      self-contemplation.</p>
     <p>'I read, and I mystified myself. The better I talked, the more my own convictions failed me;
      and, by the time you came up to Oxford, I knew how you would have shrunk from him who was your
      pride, if you could have seen into the secrets beneath.'</p>
     <p>Ethel took hold of his hand. 'You seemed bright,' she said.</p>
     <p>'It melted like a bad dream before—before the humming-bird, and with my father. It was weeks
      ere I dared to face the subject again.'</p>
     <p>'How could you? Was it safe?'</p>
     <p>'I could not have gone on as I was. Sometimes the sight of my father, or the mountains and
      lakes in Scotland, or—or—things at the Grange, would bring peace back; but there were dark
      hours, and I knew that there could be no comfort till I had examined and fought it out.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose examination was right,' said Ethel, 'for a man, and defender of the faith. I
      should only have tried to pray the terrible thought away. But I can't tell how it feels.'</p>
     <p>'Worse than you have power to imagine,' said Norman, shuddering. 'It is over now. I worked
      out their fallacies, and went over the reasoning on our side.'</p>
     <p>'And prayed—' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Indeed I did; and the confidence returned, firmer, I hope, than ever. It had never gone for
      a whole day.'</p>
     <p>Ethel breathed freely. 'It was life or death,' she said, 'and we never knew it!'</p>
     <p>'Perhaps not; but I know your prayers were angel-wings ever round me. And far more than
      argument, was the thought of my father's heart-whole Christian love and strength.'</p>
     <p>'Norman, you believed, all the time, with your heart. This was only a bewilderment of your
      intellect.'</p>
     <p>'I think you are right,' said Norman. 'To me the doubt was cruel agony—not the amusement it
      seems to some.'</p>
     <p>'Because our dear home has made the truth, our joy, our union,' said Ethel. 'And you are
      sure the cloud is gone, and for ever?' she still asked, anxiously.</p>
     <p>He stood still. 'For ever, I trust,' he said. 'I hold the faith of my childhood in all its
      fullness as surely as—as ever I loved my mother and Harry.'</p>
     <pb n="515"/>
     <p>'I know you do,' said Ethel. 'It was only a bad dream.'</p>
     <p>'I hope I may be forgiven for it,' said Norman. 'I do not know how far it was sin. It was
      gone so far as that my mind was convinced last Christmas, but the shame and sting remained. I
      was not at peace again till the news of this spring came, and brought, with the grief, this
      compensation—that I could cast behind me and forget the criticisms and doubts that those
      miserable debates had connected with sacred words.'</p>
     <p>'You will be the sounder for having fought the fight,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I do not dread the like shocks,' said her brother, 'but I long to leave this world of
      argument and discussion. It is right that there should be a constant defence and battle, but I
      am not fit for it. I argue for my own triumph, and, in heat and harassing, devotion is lost.
      Besides, the comparison of intellectual power has been my bane all my life.'</p>
     <p>'I thought "praise was your penance here."'</p>
     <p>'I would fain render it so, but—in short, I must be away from it all, and go to the
      simplest, hardest work, beginning from the rudiments, and forgetting subtle arguments.'</p>
     <p>'Forgetting <hi>yourself</hi> ,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Right. I want to have no leisure to think about myself,' said Norman. 'I am never so happy
      as at such times.'</p>
     <p>'And you want to find work so far away?'</p>
     <p>'I cannot help feeling drawn towards those Southern seas. I am glad you can give me good
      speed. But what do you think about my father?'</p>
     <p>Ethel thought and thought. 'I know he would not hinder you,' she repeated.</p>
     <p>'But you dread the pain for him? I had talked to Tom about taking his profession; but the
      poor boy thinks he dislikes it greatly, though, I believe, his real taste lies that way, and
      his aversion only arises a few grand notions he has picked up, out of which I could soon talk
      him.'</p>
     <p>'Tom will not stand in your place,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'He will be more equable and more to be depended upon,' said Norman. 'None of you appreciate
      Tom. However, you must hear my alternative. If you think my going would be too much grief for
      papa, or if Tom be set against helping him in his practice, there is an evident leading of
      Providence, shewing that I am unworthy of this work. In that case I would go abroad and throw
      myself, at once, with all my might, into the study of medicine, and get ready to give my
      father some rest. It is a shame that all his sons should turn away from his profession.'</p>
     <p>'I am more than ever amazed!' cried Ethel. 'I thought you
      <pb n="516"/> destested it. I thought papa never wished it for you. He said you had not
      nerve.'</p>
     <p>'He was always full of the tenderest consideration for me,' said Norman. 'With Heaven to
      help him, a man may have nerve for whatever is his duty.'</p>
     <p>'How he would like to have you to watch and help. But New Zealand would be so glorious!'</p>
     <p>'Glory is not for me,' said Norman. 'Understand, Ethel, the choice is New Zealand, or going
      at once—at once, mind—to study at Edinburgh or Paris.'</p>
     <p>'New Zealand at once?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I suppose I must stay for Divinity lectures, but my intention must be avowed,' said Norman,
      hastily. 'And, now, will you sound my father? I cannot.'</p>
     <p>'I can't sound,' said Ethel. 'I can only do things point-blank.'</p>
     <p>'Do then,' said Norman, 'any way you can! Only let me know which is best for him. You get
      all the disagreeable things to do, good old Unready one,' he added, kindly. 'I believe you are
      the one who would be shoved in front, if we were obliged to face a basilisk.'</p>
     <p>The brightness that had come over Norman, when he had discharged his cares upon her, was
      encouragement enough for Ethel. She only asked how much she was to repeat of their
      conversation?</p>
     <p>'Whatever you think best. I do not want to grieve him, but he must not think it fine in
      me.'</p>
     <p>Ethel privately thought that no power on earth could prevent him from doing that.</p>
     <p>It was not consistent with cautious sounding, that Norman was always looking appealingly
      towards her; and, indeed, she could not wait long with such a question on her mind. She
      remained with her father in the drawing-room, when the rest were gone up-stairs, and, plunging
      at once into the matter, she said, 'Papa, there is something that Norman cannot bear to say to
      you himself.'</p>
     <p>'Humming-birds to wit?' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'No, indeed, but he wants to be doing something at once. What should you think of—of—there
      are two things; one is—going out as a missionary—'</p>
     <p>'Humming-birds in another shape,' said the Doctor, startled, but smiling, so as to pique
      her.</p>
     <p>'You mean to treat it as a boy's fancy!' said she.</p>
     <p>'It is rather suspicious,' he said. 'Well, what is the other of his two things?'</p>
     <p>'The other is, to begin studying medicine at once, so as to help you.'</p>
     <pb n="517"/>
     <p>'Hey day!' cried Dr. May, drawing up his tall vigorous figure, 'does he think me so very
      ancient and superannuated?'</p>
     <p>What could possess him to be so provoking and unsentimental to night? Was it her own bad
      management? She longed to put an end to the conversation, and answered, 'No, but he thinks it
      hard that none of your sons should be willing to relieve you.'</p>
     <p>'It won't be Norman,' said Dr. May. 'He is not made of the stuff. If he survived the course
      of study, every patient he lost, he would bring himself in guilty of murder, and there would
      soon be an end of him!'</p>
     <p>'He says that a man can force himself to anything that is his duty.'</p>
     <p>'This is not going to be his duty, if I can make it otherwise. What is the meaning of all
      this? No, I need not ask, poor boy, it is what I was afraid of!'</p>
     <p>'It is far deeper,' said Ethel; 'and she related great part of what she had heard in the
      afternoon. It was not easy to make her father listen—his line was to be positively indignant,
      rather than compassionate, when he heard of the doubts that had assailed poor Norman. 'Foolish
      boy, what business had he to meddle with those accursed books, when he knew what they were
      made of—it was tasting poison, it was running into temptation! He had no right to expect to
      come out safe—' and then he grasped tightly hold of Ethel's hands, and, as if the terror had
      suddenly flashed on him, asked her, with dilated eye and trembling voice, whether she were
      sure that he was safe, and held the faith!</p>
     <p>Ethel repeated his asseveration, and her father covered his face with his hands in
      thanksgiving.</p>
     <p>After this, he seemed somewhat inclined to hold poor Oxford in horror, only, as he observed,
      it would be going out of the frying-pan into the fire, to take refuge at Paris—a recurrence to
      the notion of Norman's medical studies, that shewed him rather enticed by the proposal.</p>
     <p>He sent Ethel to bed, saying, he should talk to Norman and find out what was the meaning of
      it, and she walked up-stairs, much ashamed of having so ill-served her brother, as almost to
      have made him ridiculous.</p>
     <p>Dr. May and Norman never failed to come to an understanding, and after they had had a long
      drive into the country together, Dr. May told Ethel that he was afraid, of what he ought not
      to be afraid of, that she was right, that the lad was very much in earnest now, at any rate,
      and if he should continue in the same mind, he hoped he should not be so weak as to hold him
      from a blessed work.</p>
     <p>From Norman, Ethel heard the warmest gratitude for his father's
      <pb n="518"/> kindness. Nothing could be done yet, he must wait patiently for the present, but
      he was to write to his uncle, Mr. Arnott, in New Zealand, and, without pledging himself, to
      make inquiries as to the mission; and, in the meantime, return to Oxford, where, to his other
      studies, he was to add a course of medical lectures, which, as Dr. May said, would do him no
      harm, would occupy his mind, and might turn to use wherever he was.</p>
     <p>Ethel was surprised to find that Norman wrote to Flora an expression of his resolution,
      that, if he found he could be spared from assisting his father as a physician, he would give
      himself up to the mission in New Zealand. Why should he tell anyone so unsympathetic as Flora,
      who would think him wasted in either case?</p>

     <p>The fifth of May was poor Harry's eighteenth birthday, and, as usual, was a
      holiday. Etheldred privately thought his memory more likely to be respected, if Blanche and
      Aubrey were employed, than if they were left in idleness; but Mary would have been wretched,
      had the celebration been omitted, and a leisure day was never unwelcome.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer carried off Blanche and Aubrey for a walk, and Ethel found Mary at her great
      resort—Harry's cupboard—dusting and arranging his books, and the array of birthday gifts, to
      which, even to-day, she had not failed to add the marker that had been in hand at Christmas.
      Ethel entreated her to come down, and Mary promised, and presently appeared, looking so
      melancholy, that, as a sedative, Ethel set her down to the basket of scraps to find materials
      for a tippet for some one at Cocksmoor, intending, as soon as Margaret should be dressed, to
      resign her morning to the others, invite Miss Bracy to the drawing-room, and read aloud.</p>
     <p>Gertrude was waiting for her walk, till nurse should have dressed Margaret, and was frisking
      about the lawn, sometimes looking in at
      <pb n="519"/> the drawing-room window at her sisters, sometimes chattering to Adams at his
      work, or laughing to herself and the flowers, in that overflow of mirth, that seemed always
      bubbling up within her.</p>
     <p>She was standing in rapt contemplation of a pear-tree in full blossom, her hands tightly
      clasped behind the back, for greater safety from the temptation, when, hearing the
      shrubbery-gate open, she turned, expecting to see her papa, but was frightened at the sight of
      two strangers, and began to run off at full speed.</p>
     <p>'Stop! Blanche! Blanche, don't you know me?' The voice was that tone of her brothers, and
      she stood and looked, but it came from a tall, ruddy youth, in a shabby rough blue coat,
      followed by a grizzled old seaman. She was too much terrified and perplexed even to run.</p>
     <p>'What's the matter! Blanche, it is I? Why, don't you know me—Harry?'</p>
     <p>'Poor brother Harry is drowned,' she answered; and, with one bound, he was beside her, and,
      snatching her up, devoured her with kisses.</p>
     <p>'Put me down—put me down, please,' was all she could say.</p>
     <p>'It is not Blanche! What? the little Daisy, I do believe!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I am Gertrude, but please let me go;' and, at the same time, Adams hurried up, as if
      he thought her being kidnapped, but his aspect changed at the glad cry, 'Ha! Adams! how are
      you? Are they all well?'</p>
     <p>''Tisn't never Master Harry! Bless me!' as Harry's hand gave him sensible proof; 'When we
      had given you up for lost!'</p>
     <p>'My father well?' Harry asked, hurrying the words one over the other.</p>
     <p>'Quite well, sir, but he never held up his head since he heard it, and poor Miss Mary has so
      moped about. If ever I thought to see the like—'</p>
     <p>'So they did not get my letter, but I can't stop. Jennings will tell you—Take care of him.
      Come, Daisy—' for he had kept her unwilling hand all the time. 'But what's that for?' pointing
      to the black ribbons, and stopping short, startled.</p>
     <p>'Because of poor Harry, said the bewildered child.</p>
     <p>'O that's right!' cried he, striding on, and dragging her in a breathless run, as he threw
      open the well-known doors; and, she escaping from him, hid her face in Mary's lap, screaming,
      'He says he is Harry! he says he is not drowned!'</p>
     <p>At the same moment Ethel was in his arms, and his voice was sobbing, 'Ethel! Mary! home!
      Where's papa?' One moment's almost agonizing joy in the certainty of his identity! but ere she
      could look or think, he was crying 'Mary! O Ethel, see—'</p>
     <pb n="520"/>
     <p>Mary had not moved, but sat as if turned to stone, with breath suspended, wide-stretched
      eyes, and death-like cheeks—Ethel sprang to her, 'Mary, Mary dear, it is Harry! It is himself!
      Don't you see? Speak to her, Harry.'</p>
     <p>He seemed almost afraid to do so, but, recovering himself, exclaimed, 'Mary, dear old Polly,
      here I am! O, won't you speak to me?' he added, piteously, as he threw his arm round her and
      kissed her, startled at the cold touch of her cheek.</p>
     <p>The spell seemed broken, and, with a wild hoarse shriek that rang through the house, she
      struggled to regain her breath, but it would only come in painful, audible catches, as she
      held Harry's hand convulsively.</p>
     <p>'What have I done?' he exclaimed, in distress.</p>
     <p>'What's this! Who is this frightening my dear?' was old nurse's exclamation, as she and
      James came, at the outcry.</p>
     <p>'O nurse, what have I done to her?' repeated Harry.</p>
     <p>'It is joy—it is sudden joy!' said Ethel. 'See, she is better now—'</p>
     <p>'Master Harry! Well, I never!' and James, with one wring of the hand, retreated, while old
      nurse was nearly hugged to death, declaring all the time that he didn't ought to have come in
      such a way, terrifying everyone out of their senses! and as for poor Miss May—</p>
     <p>'Where is she?' cried Harry, starting at the sight of the vacant sofa.</p>
     <p>'Only up-stairs,' said Ethel; 'but where's Alan? Is not he come?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Ethel, don't you know?' His face told but too plainly.</p>
     <p>'Nurse! nurse, how <hi>shall</hi> we tell her?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Poor dear!' exclaimed nurse, sounding her tongue on the roof of her mouth. 'She'll never
      abear it without her papa. Wait for him, I should say. But bless me, Miss Mary, to see you go
      on like that, when Master Harry is come back such a bonny man!'</p>
     <p>'I'm better now,' said Mary, with an effort. 'Oh! Harry, speak to me again.'</p>
     <p>'But Margaret!' said Ethel, while the brother was holding Mary in his embrace, and she lay
      tremulous with the new ecstacy, upon his breast—'but Margaret. Nurse, you must go up, or she
      will suspect. I'll come, when I can speak quietly—Oh! poor Margaret! If Richard would but come
      in!'</p>
     <p>Ethel walked up and down the room, divided between a tumult of joy, grief, dread, and
      perplexity.—At that moment a little voice said at the door, 'Please, Margaret wants Harry to
      come up directly.'</p>
     <pb n="521"/>
     <p>They looked one upon another in consternation. They had never thought of the child, who, of
      course, had flown up at once with the tidings.</p>
     <p>'Go up, Miss Ethel,' said nurse.</p>
     <p>'Oh! nurse, I can't be the first. Come, Harry, come.'</p>
     <p>Hand-in-hand, they silently ascended the stairs, and Ethel pushed open the door. Margaret
      was on her couch, her whole form and face in one throb of expectation.</p>
     <p>She looked into Harry's face—the eagerness flitted like sunshine on the hill side, before a
      cloud, and, without a word, she held out her arms.</p>
     <p>He threw himself on his knees, and her fingers were clasped among his thick curls, while his
      frame heaved with suppressed sobs, 'O, if he could only have come back to you.'</p>
     <p>'Thank God,' she said; then slightly pushing him back, she lay holding his hand in one of
      hers, and resting the other on his shoulder, and gazing in silence into his face. Each was
      still—she was gathering strength—he dreaded word or look.</p>
     <p>'Tell me how and where?' she said, at last.</p>
     <p>'It was in the Loyalty isles; it was fever—the exertions for us. His head was lying here,'
      and he pointed to his own breast. 'He sent his love to you—he bade me tell you there would be
      meeting by-and-by, in the haven where he would be.—I laid his head in the grave—under the
      great palm—I said some of the prayers—there are Christians round it.'</p>
     <p>He said this in short disconnected phrases, often pausing to gather voice, but forced to
      resume, by her inquiring looks, and pressure of his hand.</p>
     <p>She asked no more. 'Kiss me,' she said, and when he had done so, 'Thank you, go down,
      please, all of you. You have brought great relief. Thank you. But I can't talk yet. You shall
      tell me the rest by-and-by.'</p>
     <p>She sent them all away, even Ethel, who would have lingered.</p>
     <p>'Go to him, dearest. Let me be alone. Don't be uneasy. This is peace—but go.'</p>
     <p>Ethel found Mary and Harry interlaced into one moving figure, and Harry greedily asking for
      his father and Norman, as if famishing for the sight of them. He wanted to set out to seek the
      former in the town, but his movements were too uncertain, and the girls clung to the
      newly-found, as if they could not trust him away from them. They wandered about, speaking, all
      three at random, without power of attending to the answers. It was enough to see him, and
      touch him; they could not yet care where he had been.</p>
     <p>Dr. May was in the midst of them ere they were aware. One
      <pb n="522"/> look, and he flung his arms round his son, but, suddenly letting him go, he
      burst away, and banged his study door. Harry would have followed.</p>
     <p>'No, don't,' said Ethel; then, seeing him disappointed, she came nearer, and murmured, "He
      entered into his chamber and—"</p>
     <p>Harry silenced her with another embrace, but their father was with them again, to verify
      that he had really seen his boy, and ask, alas! whether Alan were with Margaret. The brief sad
      answer sent him to see how it was with her. She would not let him stay; she said it was
      infinite comfort, and joy was coming, but she would rather be still, and not come down till
      evening.</p>
     <p>Perhaps others would fain have been still, could they have borne an instant's deprivation of
      the sight of their dear sailor, while greetings came thickly on him. The children burst in,
      having heard a report in the town, and Dr. Spencer waited at the door for the confirmation;
      but when Ethel would have flown out to him, he waved his hand, shut the door, and hurried
      away, as if a word to her would have been an intrusion.</p>
     <p>The brothers had been summoned by a headlong apparition of Will Adams in Cocksmoor school,
      shouting that Master Harry was come home; and Norman's long legs out-speeding Richard, had
      brought him back, flushed, and too happy for one word, while, 'Well, Harry,' was Richard's
      utmost, and his care for Margaret seemed to overpower everything else, as he went up, and was
      not so soon sent away.</p>
     <p>Words were few down-stairs. Blanche and Aubrey agreed that they thought people would have
      been much happier, but, in fact, the joy was oppressive from very newness. Ethel roamed about,
      she could not sit still without feeling giddy, in the strangeness of the revulsion. Her father
      sat, as if a word would break the blest illusion; and Harry stood before each of them in turn,
      as if about to speak, but turned his address into a sudden caress, or blow on the shoulder,
      and tried to laugh. Little Gertrude, not understanding the confusion, had taken up her station
      under the table, and peeped out from beneath the cover.</p>
     <p>There was more composure as they sat at dinner, and yet there was very little talking or
      eating. Afterwards, Dr. May and Norman exultingly walked away, to shew their Harry to Dr.
      Spencer and Mr. Wilmot; and Ethel would gladly have tried to calm herself, and recover the
      balance of her mind, by giving thanks where they were due; but she did not know what to do
      with her sisters. Blanche was wild, and Mary still in so shakey a state of excitement, that
      she went off into mad laughing, when Blanche discovered that they were in mourning for
      Harry.</p>
     <pb n="523"/>
     <p>Nothing would satisfy Blanche but breaking in on Margaret, and climbing to the top of the
      great wardrobe to disinter the coloured raiment, beseeching that each favourite might be at
      once put on, to do honour to Harry. Mary chimed in with her, in begging for the wedding
      merinos—would not Margaret wear her beautiful blue?</p>
     <p>'No, my dear, I cannot,' said Margaret, gently.</p>
     <p>Mary looked at her, and was again in a flood of tears, incoherently protesting, together
      with Ethel, that they would not change.</p>
     <p>'No, dears,' said Margaret. 'I had rather you did so. You must not be unkind to Harry. He
      will not think I do not welcome him. I am only too glad that Richard would not let my
      impatience take away my right to wear this.'</p>
     <p>Ethel knew that it was for life.</p>
     <p>Mary could not check her tears, and <hi>would</hi> go on making heroic protests against
      leaving off her black, sobbing the more at each. Margaret's gentle caresses seemed to make her
      worse; and Ethel, afraid that Margaret's own composure would be overthrown, exclaimed, 'How
      can you be so silly? Come away!' and rather roughly pulled her out of the room, when she
      collapsed entirely at the top of the stairs, and sat crying helplessly.</p>
     <p>'I can't think what's the use of Harry's coming home,' Gertrude was heard saying to Richard.
      'It is very disagreeable,' whereat Mary relapsed into a giggle, and Ethel felt frantic.</p>
     <p>'Richard! Richard, what <hi>is</hi> to be done with Mary? She can't help it, I believe, but
      this is not the way to treat the mercy that—'</p>
     <p>'Mary had better go and lie down in her own room,' said Richard, tenderly and gravely.</p>
     <p>'O, please! please!' began Mary, 'I shall not see him when he comes back!'</p>
     <p>'If you can't behave properly when he does come,' said Richard, 'there is no use in being
      there.'</p>
     <p>'Remember, Ritchie,' said Ethel, thinking him severe, 'she has not been well this long
      time.'</p>
     <p>Mary began to plead; but, with his own pretty persuasive manner, he took her by the hand,
      and drew her into his room; and when he came down, after an interval, it was to check Blanche,
      who would have gone up to interrupt her with queries about the perpetual blue merino. He sat
      down with Blanche on the stair-case window-seat, and did not let her go, till he had gently
      talked her out of flighty spirits, into the soberness of thankfulness.</p>
     <p>Ethel, meanwhile, had still done nothing but stray about, long for loneliness, find herself
      too unsteady to finish her letters to Flora and Tom; and, while she tried to make Gertrude
      think Harry
      <pb n="524"/> a pleasant acquisition, she hated her own wild heart, that could not rejoice,
      nor give thanks, aright.</p>
     <p>By-and-by, Mary came down, with her bonnet on, quite quiet now. 'I am going to Church with
      Ritchie,' she said. Ethel caught at the notion, and it spread through the house. Dr. May, who
      just then came in with his two sons, looked at Harry, saying, 'What do you think of it? Shall
      we go, my boy?' And Harry, as soon as he understood, declared that he should like nothing
      better. It seemed what they all needed; even Aubrey and Gertrude begged to come; and, when the
      solemn old Minster was above their heads, and the hallowed stillness around them, the
      tightened sense of half-realized joy began to find relief in the chant of glory. The voices of
      the Sanctuary, ever uplifting notes of praise, seemed to gather together and soften their
      emotions; and agitation was soothed away, and all that was oppressive and tumultuous gave
      place to sweet peace and thankfulness. Ethel dimly remembered the like sense of relief, when
      her mother had hushed her wild ecstacy, while sympathizing with her joy. Richard could not
      trust his voice, but Mr. Wilmot offered the special thanksgiving.</p>
     <p>Harry was, indeed, "at home," and his tears fell fast over his book, as he heard his
      father's 'Amen,' so fervent and so deep; and he gazed up and around, with fond and earnest
      looks, as thoughts and resolutions, formed there of old, came gathering thick upon him. And
      there little Gertrude seemed first to accept him. She whispered to her papa, as they stood up
      to go away, that it was very good in God Almighty to have sent Harry home; and, as they left
      the Cloister, she slipped into Harry's hand a daisy from the grave, such a gift as she had
      never carried to anyone else, save her father and Margaret, and she shrank no longer from
      being lifted up in his arms, and carried home through the twilight street.</p>
     <p>He hurried into the drawing-room, and was heard declaring that all was right, for Margaret
      was on the sofa; but he stopped short, grieved at her altered looks. She smiled as he stooped
      to kiss her, and then made him stand erect, and measure himself against Norman, whose height
      he had almost reached. The little curly midshipman had come back, as nurse said, 'a
      fine-growed young man,' his rosy cheeks, brown and ruddy, and his countenance—</p>
     <p>'You are much more like papa and Norman than I thought you would be,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'He has left his snub nose, and yellow locks behind,' said his father; 'though the shaggy
      mane seems to remain. I believe lions grow darker with age—So there stand June and July
      together again?'</p>
     <pb n="525"/>
     <p>Dr. May walked backwards to look at them. It was good to see his face!</p>
     <p>'I shall see Flora and Tom to-morrow!' said Harry, after nodding with satisfaction, as they
      all took their wonted places.</p>
     <p>'Going!' exclaimed Richard.</p>
     <p>'Why, don't you know,' said Ethel; it is current in the nursery that he is going to be tried
      by court-martial for living with the King of the Cannibal islands.'</p>
     <p>'Aubrey says he had a desert island, with Jennings for his man Friday,' said Blanche.</p>
     <p>'Harry,' said little Gertrude, who had established herself on his knee, 'did you really poke
      out the giant's eye with the top of a fir-tree?'</p>
     <p>'Who told you so, Daisy?' was the general cry; but she became shy, and would not answer more
      than by a whisper about Aubrey, who indignantly declared that he never said so, only Gertrude
      was so foolish, that she did not know Harry from Ulysses.</p>
     <p>'After all,' said Ethel, 'I don't think our notions are much more defined. Papa and Norman
      may know more, but we have heard almost nothing. I have been waiting to hear more to close up
      my letters to Flora and Tom. What a shame that has not been done!'</p>
     <p>'I'll finish,' said Mary, running to the side-table.</p>
     <p>'And tell her I'll be there to-morrow,' said Harry. 'I must report myself, and what fun to
      see Flora a member of parliament! Come with me, June, I'll be back next day. I wish you all
      would come.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I must come with you,' said Norman. I shall have to go to Oxford on Thursday—' and
      very reluctant he looked. 'Tell Flora I am coming, Mary.'</p>
     <p>'How did you know that Flora was a married lady?' asked Blanche, in her would-be grown up
      manner.</p>
     <p>'I heard that from Aunt Flora. A famous lot of news I picked up there!'</p>
     <p>'Aunt Flora!'</p>
     <p>'Did you not know he had been at Auckland?' said Dr. May. 'Aunt Flora had to nurse him well
      after all he had undergone. Did you not think her very like mamma, Harry?'</p>
     <p>'Mamma never looked half so old!' cried Harry, indignantly.</p>
     <p>'Flora was five years younger!'</p>
     <p>'She has got her voice and way with her,' said Harry; 'but you will soon see. She is coming
      home soon.'</p>
     <p>There was a great outcry of delight.</p>
     <p>'Yes, there is some money of uncle Arnott's that must be looked after, but he does not like
      the voyage, and can't leave his office, so
      <pb n="526"/> perhaps Aunt Flora may come alone. She had a great mind to come with me, but
      there was no good berth for her in this schooner, and I could not wait for another chance. I
      can't think what possessed the letters not to come! She would not write by the first packet,
      because I was so ill, but we both wrote by the next, and I made sure you had them, or I would
      have written before I came.'</p>
     <p>The words were not out of his mouth, before the second post was brought in, and there were
      two letters from New Zealand! What would they not have been yesterday? Harry would have burnt
      his own, but the long closely-written sheets were eagerly seized, as affording the best hope
      of understanding his adventures, as it had been written at intervals from Auckland, and the
      papers, passing from one to the other, formed the text for interrogations on further details,
      though much more was gleaned incidentally in <hi>tête à têtes</hi> , by Margaret, Norman, or
      his father, and no one person ever heard the whole connectedly from Harry himself.</p>
     <p>'What was the first you knew of the fire, Harry?' asked Dr. May, looking up from the
      letter.</p>
     <p>'Owen shaking me awake; and I thought it was a hoax,' said Harry. 'But it was true enough,
      and when we got on deck, there were clouds of smoke coming up the main hatch-way.'</p>
     <p>Margaret's eyes were upon him, and her lips formed the question, 'And he?'</p>
     <p>'He met us, and told us to be steady—but there was little need for that! Every man there was
      as cool and collected as if it had been no more than the cook's stove, and we should have
      scorned to be otherwise! He put his hand on my shoulder and said, "Keep by me," and I
      did.'</p>
     <p>'Then there was never much hope of extinguishing the fire?'</p>
     <p>'No—if you looked down below the forecastle it was like a furnace, and though the pumps were
      at work, it was only to gain time while the boats were lowered. The First Lieutenant told off
      the men, and they went down the side without one word, only shaking hands with those that were
      left.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Harry! what were you thinking of?' cried Blanche.</p>
     <p>'Of the powder,' said Harry.</p>
     <p>Ethel thought there was more in that answer than met the ear, and that Harry, at least, had
      thought of the powder to-night at Church.</p>
     <p>'Mr. Ernescliffe had the command of the second cutter. He asked to take me with him, I was
      glad enough, and Owen—he is a mate, you know—went with us.'</p>
     <p>As to telling how he felt when he saw the good ship Alcestis blown to fragments, that was
      past Harry, and all but Blanche were
      <pb n="527"/> wise enough not to ask. She had by way of answer, 'Very glad to be safe out of
      her.'</p>
     <p>Nor was Harry willing to dwell on the subsequent days, when the unclouded sun had been a
      cruel foe: and the insufficient stores of food and water, did, indeed, sustain life, but a
      life of extreme suffering. What he told was of the kindness that strove to save him, as the
      youngest, from all that could be spared him. 'If I dropped asleep at the bottom of the boat, I
      was sure to find some one shading me from the sun. If there was an extra drop of water, they
      wanted me to have it.'</p>
     <p>'Tell me their names, Harry!' cried Dr. May. 'If ever I meet one of them!'</p>
     <p>'But the storm, Harry, the storm?' asked Blanche. 'Was that not terrible?'</p>
     <p>'Very comfortable at first, Blanche,' was the answer. 'Oh! that rain!'</p>
     <p>'But when it grew so very bad?'</p>
     <p>'We did not reck much what happened to us,' said Harry. 'It could not be worse than
      starving. When we missed the others in the morning, most of us thought them the best off.'</p>
     <p>Mary could not help coming round to kiss him, as if eyes alone were not enough to satisfy
      her that here he was.</p>
     <p>Dr. May shuddered, and went on reading, and Margaret drew Harry down to her, and once more
      by looks, craved for more minute tidings.</p>
     <p>'All that you can think,' murmured Harry; 'the very life and soul of us all—so kind, and yet
      discipline as perfect as on board. But don't now, Margaret—'</p>
     <p>The tone of the <hi>don't</hi> , the reddening cheek, liquid eye, and heaving chest, told
      enough of what the Lieutenant had been to one, at least, of the desolate boat's crew.</p>
     <p>'Oh! Harry, Harry! I can't bear it,' exclaimed Mary. 'How long did it last? How did it
      end?'</p>
     <p>'Fifteen days,' said Harry. 'It was time it should end, for all the water we had caught in
      the storm, was gone—we gave the last drop to Jones, for we thought him dying—one's tongue was
      like a dry sponge.'</p>
     <p>'How did it end?' repeated Mary, in an agony.</p>
     <p>'Jennings saw a sail. We thought it all a fancy of weakness, but 'twas true enough, and they
      saw our signal of distress!'</p>
     <p>The vessel proved to be an American whaler, which had just parted with her cargo to a
      homeward bound ship, and was going to refit, and take in provision and water at one of the
      Milanesian islands, before returning for further captures. The master was a
      <pb n="528"/> man of the shrewd, hard money-making cast; but, at the price of Mr.
      Ernescliffe's chronometer, and of the services of the sailors, he undertook to convey them
      where they might fall in with packets bound for Australia.</p>
     <p>The distressed Alcestes at first thought themselves in paradise, but the vessel, built with
      no view, save to whales, and, with a considerable reminiscence of the blubber lately parted
      with, proved no wholesome abode, when overcrowded, and in the tropics! Mr. Ernescliffe's
      science, resolution, and constancy, had saved his men so far; but with the need for exertion,
      his powers gave way, and he fell a prey to a return of the fever, which had been his
      introduction to Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'There he was,' said Harry, 'laid up in a little bit of a stifling cabin, just like an over;
      without the possibility of a breath of air! The skin-flint skipper carried no medicine; the
      water, shocking stuff it was, was getting so low, that there was only a pint a day served out
      to each, and though all of us Alcestes clubbed every drop we could spare for him—it was bad
      work! Owen and I never were more glad in our lives than when we heard we were to cast anchor
      at the Loyalty isles! Such a place as it was! You little know what it was to see anything
      green! And there was this isle fringed down close to the sea with cocoa-nut trees! and the bay
      as clear!—you could see every shell, and wonderful fishes swimming in it! Well, everyone was
      for going ashore, and some of the natives swam out to us, and brought things in their canoes,
      but not many; it is not encouraged by the mission, nor by David— for those Yankee traders are
      not the most edifying society—and the crew vowed they were cannibals, and had eaten a man
      three years ago, so they all went ashore armed.'</p>
     <p>'You staid with him,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Aye, it was my turn, and I was glad enough to have some fresh fruit and water for him, but
      he could not take any notice of it. Did not I want you, papa? Well, by-and-by, Owen came back,
      in a perfect rapture with the place and the people, and said it was the only hope for Mr.
      Ernescliffe, to take him on shore—'</p>
     <p>'Then you did really go amongst the cannibals!' exclaimed Blanche.</p>
     <p>'That is all nonsense,' said Harry. 'Some of them may once have been, and I fancy the
      heathens might not mind a bit of "long pig" still; but these have been converted by the
      Samoans.'</p>
     <p>The Samoans, it was further explained, are the inhabitants of the Navigator islands, who,
      having been converted by the Church Missionary Society, have sent out great numbers of most
      active and admirable teachers among the scattered islands, braying martyrdom
      <pb n="529"/> and disease, never shrinking from their work, and, by teaching and example,
      preparing the way for fuller doctrine than they can yet impart. A station of these devoted men
      had for some years been settled in this island, and had since been visited by the missions of
      Newcastle, and New Zealand. The young chief, whom Harry called David, and another youth, had
      spent two summers under instruction at New Zealand, and had been baptized. They were spending
      the colder part of the year at home, and hoped shortly to be called for by the mission-ship to
      return, and resume their course of instruction.</p>
     <p>Owen had come to an understanding with the chief, and the Samoans, and had decided on
      landing his Lieutenant, and it was accordingly done, with very little consciousness, on the
      patient's part. Black figures, with woolly mop-heads, and sometimes decorated with whitewash
      of lime, crowded round to assist in the transport of the sick man through the surf; and David
      himself, in a white European garb, met his guests, with dignified manners that would have
      suited a prince of any land, and conducted them through the grove of palms, interspersed with
      white huts, to a beautiful house consisting of a central room, with many others opening from
      it, floored with white coral lime, and lined with soft shining mats of Samoan manufacture.
      This, Harry learnt, had been erected by them in hopes of an English Missionary taking up his
      abode amongst them.</p>
     <p>They were a kindly people, and had shown hospitality to other Englishmen, who had less
      appreciated it than these young officers could. They lavished every kindness in their power
      upon them, and Mr. Ernescliffe, at first, revived so much, that he seemed likely to
      recover.</p>
     <p>But the ship had completed her repairs, and was ready to sail. The two midshipmen thought it
      would be certain death to their Lieutenant to bring him back to such an atmosphere; "and so,"
      continued Harry's letter to his father, "I thought there was nothing for it, but for me to
      stay with him, and that you would say so. I got Owen to consent, after some trouble, as we
      were sure to be fetched off one time or another. We said not a word to Mr. Ernescliffe, for he
      was only sensible now and then, so that Owen had the command. Owen made the skipper leave me a
      pistol and some powder, but I was ashamed David should know it, and stowed it away. As to the
      quarter-master, old Jennings, whose boy you remember we picked up at the Roman camp, he had
      not forgotten that, and when we were shaking hands and wishing good-bye, he leapt up, and
      vowed 'he would never leave the young gentleman that had befriended his boy, to be eaten up by
      them black savage niggers. If they made roast-pork of Mr. May, he would be eaten first, though
      <pb n="530"/> he reckoned they would find him a tougher morsel.' I don't think Owen was sorry
      he volunteered, and no words can tell what a blessing the good old fellow was to us both.</p>
     <p>"So there we staid, and, at first, Mr. Ernescliffe seemed mending. The delirium went off, he
      could talk quite clearly and comfortably, and he used to lie listening, when David and I had
      our odd sort of talks. I believe, if you had been there, or we could have strengthened him any
      way, he might have got over it; but he never thought he should, and he used to talk to me
      about all of you, and said Stoneborough had been the most blessed spot in his life; he had
      never had so much of a home, and that sharing our grief, and knowing you, had done him great
      good, just when he might have been getting elated. I cannot recollect it all, though I tried
      hard, for Margaret's sake, but he said Hector would have a great deal of temptation, and he
      hoped you would be a father to him, and Norman an elder brother. You would not think how much
      he talked of Cocksmoor, about a Church being built there, as Ethel wished, and little Daisy
      laying the first stone. I remember one night, I don't know whether he was quite himself, for
      he looked full at me with his eyes, that had grown so large, till I did not know what was
      coming, and he said, 'I have seen a ship built by a sailor's vow; the roof was like the
      timbers of a ship—that was right. Mind, it is so. That is the ship that bears through the
      waves; there is the anchor that enters within the veil.' I believe that was what he said. I
      could not forget that—he looked at me so; but much more he said, that I dimly remember, and
      chiefly about poor dear Margaret. He bade me tell her—his own precious pearl, as he used to
      call her—that he was quite content, and believed it was best for her and him both, that all
      should be thus settled, for they did not part for ever, and he trusted—but I can't write all
      that." (There was a great tear-blot just here). "It is too good to recollect anywhere but at
      Church. I have been there to-day, with my uncle and aunt, and I thought I could have told it
      when I came home, but I was too tired to write then, and now I don't seem as if it could be
      written anyhow. When I come home, I will try to tell Margaret. The most part was about her;
      only what was better seemed to swallow that up."</p>
     <p>The narrative broke off here, but had been subsequently resumed. "For all Mr. Ernescliffe
      talked as I told you, he was so quiet and happy, that I made sure he was getting well, but
      Jennings did not; and there came an old heathen native once to see us, who asked why we did
      not bury him alive, because he got no better, and gave trouble. At last, one night—it was the
      third of August—he was very restless, and could not breathe, nor lie easily; I lifted him up
      in my arms,
      <pb n="531"/> for he was very light and thin, and tried to make him more comfortable. But
      presently he said, 'Is it you, Harry? God bless you;' and, in a minute, I knew he was dead.
      You will tell Margaret all about it. I don't think she can love him more than I did; and she
      did not half know him, for she never saw him on board, nor in all that dreadful time, nor in
      his illness. She will never know what she has lost."</p>
     <p>There was another break here, and the story was continued.</p>
     <p>"We buried him the next day, where one could see the sea, close under the great palm, where
      David hopes to have a Church one of these days. David helped us, and said the Lord's Prayer
      and the Glory with us there. I little thought, when I used to grumble at my two verses of the
      Psalms every day, when I should want the ninetieth, or how glad I should be to know so many by
      heart, for they were such a comfort to Mr. Ernescliffe."</p>
     <p>"David got us a nice bit of wood, and Jennings carved the Cross, and his name, and all about
      him. I should have liked to have done it, but I knocked up after that. Jennings thinks I had a
      sun-stroke. I don't know, but my head was so bad, whenever I moved, that I thought only
      Jennings would ever have come to tell you about it. Jennings looked after me as if I had been
      his own son; and there was David too, as kind as if he had been Richard himself—always sitting
      by, to bathe my forehead, or, when I was a little better, to talk to me, and ask me questions
      about his Christian teaching. You must not think of him like a savage, for he is my friend,
      and a far more perfect gentleman than I ever saw anyone, but you, papa, holding the command
      over his people so easily and courteously, and then coming to me with little easy first
      questions about the Belief, and such things, like what we used to ask mamma. He liked nothing
      so well as for me to tell him about King David; and we had learnt a good deal of each other's
      languages by that time. The notion of his heart—like Cocksmoor to Ethel—is, to get a real
      English mission, and have all his people Christians. Ethel talked of good kings being Davids
      to their line; I think that is what he will be, if he lives; but those islanders have been
      dying off since Europeans came among them."</p>
     <p>But Harry's letter could not tell what he confessed, one night, to his father, the next time
      he was out with him by star-light, how desolate he had been, and how he had yearned after his
      home, and, one evening, he had been utterly overcome by illness and loneliness, and had cried
      most bitterly and uncontrollably; and, though Jennings thought it was for his friend's death,
      it really was homesickness, and the thought of his father and Mary. Jennings had helped him
      out to the entrance of the hut, that the cool night
      <pb n="532"/> air might refresh his burning brow. Orion shone clear and bright, and brought
      back the night when they had chosen the starry hunter as his friend. "It seemed," he said, "as
      if you all were looking at me, and smiling to me in the stars. And there was the Southern
      Cross upright, which was like the Minster to me; and I recollected it was Sunday morning at
      home, and knew you would be thinking about me. I was so glad you had let me be Confirmed, and
      be with you that last Sunday, papa, for it seemed to join me on so much the more; and when I
      thought of the words in Church, they seemed, somehow, to float on me so much more than ever
      before, and it was like the Minster, and your voice. I should not have minded dying so much
      after that."</p>
     <p>At last, Harry's Black Prince had hurried into the hut with the tidings that his English
      father's ship was in the bay, and soon English voices again sounded in his ears, bringing the
      forlorn boy such warmth of kindness that he could hardly believe himself a mere stranger. If
      Alan could but have shared the joy with him!</p>
     <p>He was carried down to the boat in the cool of the evening, and paused on the way, for a
      last farewell to the lonely grave under the palm tree—one of the many sailors' graves
      scattered from the tropics to the poles, and which might be the first seed in a 'God's acre'
      to that island, becoming what the graves of holy men of old are to us.</p>
     <p>A short space more of kind care from his new friends, and his Christian Chief, and Harry
      awoke from a feverish doze at sounds that seemed so like a dream of home, that he was
      unwilling to break them by rousing himself, but they approved themselves as real, and he found
      himself in the embrace of his mother's sister.</p>
     <p>And here Mrs. Arnott's story began, of the note that reached her in the early morning with
      tidings that her nephew had been picked up by the mission-ship, and how she and her husband
      had hastened, at once, on board.</p>
     <p>"They sent me below to see a hero," she wrote. "What I saw was, a scarecrow sort of likeness
      of you, dear Richard; but, when he opened his eyes, there was our Maggie smiling at me. I
      suppose he would not forgive me for telling how he sobbed and cried, when he had his arms
      round my neck, and his poor aching head on my shoulder. Poor fellow, he was very weak, and I
      believe he felt, for the moment, as if he had found his mother."</p>
     <p>"We brought him home with us, but when the next mail went, the fever was still so high, that
      I thought it would be only alarm to you to write, and I had not half a story either, though
      you may guess how proud I was of my nephew."</p>
     <p>Harry's troubles were all over from that time. He had thenceforth to recover under his
      aunt's motherly care, while talking
      <pb n="533"/> endlessly over the home that she loved almost as well as he did. He was well
      more quickly than she had ventured to hope, and nothing could check his impatience to reach
      his home, not even the hopes of having his aunt for a companion. The very happiness he enjoyed
      with her only made him long the more ardently to be with his own family; and he had taken his
      leave of her, and of his dear David, and sailed by the first packet leaving Auckland.</p>
     <p>'I never knew what the old Great Bear was to me till I saw him again!' said Harry.</p>
     <p>It was late when the elders had finished all that was to be heard at present, and the clock
      reminded them that they must part.</p>
     <p>'And you go to-morrow?' sighed Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I must. Jennings has to go on to Portsmouth, and see after his son.'</p>
     <p>'O, let me see Jennings!' exclaimed Margaret. 'May I not, papa?'</p>
     <p>Richard, who had been making friends with Jennings, whenever he had not been needed by his
      sisters that afternoon, went to fetch him from the kitchen, where all the servants, and all
      their particular friends, were listening to the yarn that made them hold their heads higher,
      as belonging to Master Harry.</p>
     <p>Harry stepped forward, met Jennings, and said, aside, 'My sister, Jennings; my sister that
      you have heard of.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May had already seen the sailor, but he could not help addressing him again. 'Come in;
      come in, and see my boy among us all. Without you, we never should have had him.'</p>
     <p>'Make him come to me,' said Margaret, breathlessly, as the embarrassed sailor stood,
      sleeking down his hair; and, when he had advanced to her couch, she looked up in his face, and
      put her hand into his great brown one.</p>
     <p>'I could'not help saying thank you,' she said.</p>
     <p>'Mr. May, sir!' cried Jennings, almost crying, and looking round for Harry, as a sort of
      protector—'tell them, sir, please, it was only my duty—I could not do no less, and you knows
      it, sir,' as if Harry had been making an accusation against him.</p>
     <p>'We know you could not,' said Margaret, 'and that is what we would thank you for, if we
      could. I know he—Mr. Ernescliffe— must have been much more at rest for leaving my brother with
      so kind a friend, and—'</p>
     <p>'Please, miss, don't say no more about it. Mr. Ernescliffe was as fine an officer as ever
      stepped a quarter-deck, and Mr. May here won't fall short of him; and was I to be after
      leaving the like of them to the mercy of the black fellows—that was not so bad neither?
      <pb n="534"/> If it had only pleased God that we had brought them both back to you, miss; but,
      you see, a man can't be everything at once, and Mr. Ernescliffe was not so stout as his
      heart.'</p>
     <p>'You did everything, we know—' began Dr. May.</p>
     <p>''Twas a real pleasure,' said Jennings, hastily, 'for two such real gentlemen as they was.
      Mr. May, sir, I beg your pardon if I say it to your face, never flinched, nor spoke a word of
      complaint, through it all; and, as to the other—'</p>
     <p>'Margaret cannot bear this,' said Richard, coming near. 'It is too much.'</p>
     <p>The sailor shook his head, and was retreating, but Margaret signed him to come near again,
      and grasped his hand. Harry followed him out of the room, to arrange their journey, and
      presently returned.</p>
     <p>'He says he is glad he has seen Margaret; he says she is the right sort of stuff for Mr.
      Ernescliffe.'</p>
     <p>Harry had not intended Margaret to hear, but she caught the words, smiled radiantly, and
      whispered, 'I wish I may be!'</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter">
     <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
     <p>Margaret had borne the meeting much too well for her own good, and a wakeful night
      of palpitation was the consequence; but she would not allow anyone to take it to heart, and
      declared that she should be ready to enjoy Harry by the time he should return, and meantime,
      she should dwell on the delight of his meeting Flora.</p>
     <p>No one had rested too soundly that night, and Dr. May had not been able to help looking in
      at his sleeping boy at five in the morning, to certify himself that he had not only figured
      his present bliss to himself, in his ten minutes' dream. And looking in again at half-past
      seven, he found Harry half-dressed, with his arm round Mary; laughing, almost sobbing, over
      the treasures in his cupboard, which he had newly discovered in their fresh order.</p>
     <p>Dr. May looked like a new man that morning, with his brightened eye and bearing, as if there
      were a well-spring of joy within him, ready to brim over at once in tear and in smile, and
      finding an outlet in the praise and thanksgiving that his spirit chanted, and his
      <pb n="535"/> face expressed, and in that sunny genial benevolence that must make all share
      his joy.</p>
     <p>He was going to run over half the town—everyone would like to hear it from him; Ethel and
      Mary must go to the rest—the old women in the almshouses, where lived an old cook who used to
      be fond of Harry—they should have a feast—all who were well enough in the hospital should have
      a tea-drinking—Dr. Hoxton had already granted a holiday to the school; every boy with whom
      they had any connection should come to dinner, and Edward Anderson should be asked to meet
      Harry on his return, because, poor fellow, he was so improved.</p>
     <p>Dr. May was in a such a transport of kind-hearted schemes, that he was not easily made to
      hear that Harry had not a sixpence wherewith to reach London.</p>
     <p>Ethel, meanwhile, was standing beside her brother tendering to him some gold, as his last
      quarter.</p>
     <p>'How did you get it Ethel? do you keep the purse?'</p>
     <p>'No, but papa took Cocksmoor in your stead, when—'</p>
     <p>'Nonsense, Ethel,' said Harry; 'I don't want it. Have I not all my pay and allowance for the
      whole time I was dead? And as to robbing Cocksmoor—'</p>
     <p>'Yes, keep it, Ethel,' said her father, 'do you think I would take it <hi>now</hi> , when if
      there were a thankoffering in the world!—And, by-the-by, your Cocksmoor children must have
      something to remember this by—'</p>
     <p>Everyone could have envied Norman, for travelling to London with Harry, but that he must
      proceed to Oxford in two days, when Harry would return to them. The station-master, thinking
      he could not do enough for the returned mariner, put the two brothers into the <hi>coupé</hi>
      , as if they had been a bridal couple, and they were very glad of the privacy, having, as yet,
      hardly spoken to each other, when Harry's attention was dispersed among so many.</p>
     <p>Norman asked many questions about the mission work in the southern hemisphere, and ended by
      telling his brother of his design, which met with Harry's hearty approbation.</p>
     <p>'That's right, old June. There's nothing they want so much, as such as you. How glad my aunt
      will be! Perhaps you will see David! Oh! if you were to go out to the Loyalty group!'</p>
     <p>'Very possibly I might,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Tell them you are my brother, and how they will receive you. I can see the mop-heads they
      will dress in honour of you, and what a feast of pork and yams you will have to eat! But there
      is plenty of work among the Maoris for you—they want a Clergyman terribly
      <pb n="536"/> at the next village to my uncle's place. I say, Norman, it will go hard if I
      don't get a ship bound for the Pacific, and come and see you.'</p>
     <p>'I shall reckon on you. That is, if I have not to stay to help my father.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure,' exclaimed Harry; 'I thought you would have staid at home, and married little
      Miss Rivers!'</p>
     <p>Thus broadly and boyishly did he plunge into that most tender subject, making his brother
      start and wince, as if he had touched a wound.</p>
     <p>'Nonsense!' he cried, almost angrily.</p>
     <p>'Well! you used to seem very much smitten, but so, to be sure, were some of the Alcestes
      with the young ladies at Valparaiso. How we used to roast Owen about that Spanish Donna, and
      he was as bad at Sydney about the young lady, whose father, we told him, was a convict, though
      he kept such a swell carriage. He had no peace about his father-in-law, the house-breaker!
      Don't I remember how you pinched her hand the night you were righted!'</p>
     <p>'You know nothing about it,' said Norman, shortly. 'She is far beyond my reach.'</p>
     <p>'A fine lady? Ha? Well, I should have thought you as good as Flora, any day,' said Harry,
      indignantly.</p>
     <p>'She is what she always was,' said Norman, anxious to silence him; 'but it is unreasonable
      to think of it. She is all but engaged to Sir Henry Walkinghame.'</p>
     <p>'Walkinghame!' cried the volatile sailor. 'I have half a mind to send in my name to Flora as
      Miss Walkinghame!' and he laughed heartily over that adventure, ending, however, with a sigh,
      as he said, 'It had nearly cost me a great deal! But tell me, Norman, how has that Meta, as
      they called her, turned out? I never saw anything prettier or nicer than she was that day of
      the Roman encampment, and I should be sorry if that fine fashionable aunt of hers, had made
      her stuck-up and disdainful.'</p>
     <p>'No such thing,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>Ha! said Harry to himself, I see how it is! She has gone and made poor old June unhappy,
      with her scornful airs—a little impertinent puss!—I wonder Flora does not teach her better
      manners.</p>
     <p>Norman, meanwhile, as the train sped over roofs, and among chimneys, was reproaching himself
      for running into the fascination of her presence, and then recollecting that her situation, as
      well as his destiny, both guaranteed that they could meet only as friendly connections.</p>
     <p>No carriage awaited them at the station, which surprised Norman,
      <pb n="537"/> till he recollected that the horses had probably been out all day, and it was
      eight o'clock. Going to Park Lane in a cab, the brothers were further surprised to find
      themselves evidently not expected. The butler came to speak to them, saying that Mr. and Mrs.
      Rivers were gone out to dinner, but would return, probably, at about eleven o'clock. He
      conducted them up-stairs, Harry following his brother, in towering vexation and
      disappointment, trying to make him turn to hear that they would go directly—home—to
      Eton—anywhere— why would he go in at all?</p>
     <p>The door was opened, Mr. May was announced, and they were in a silk-lined <hi>boudoir</hi> ,
      where a little slender figure in black started up, and came forward with outstretched
      hand.</p>
     <p>'Norman!' she cried, 'How are you? Are you come on your way to Oxford?'</p>
     <p>'Has not Flora had Mary's letter?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, she said she had one. She was keeping it till she had time to read it.'</p>
     <p>As she spoke, Meta had given her hand to Harry, as it was evidently expected; she raised her
      eyes to his face, and said, smiling, and blushing, 'I am sure I ought to know you, but I am
      afraid I don't.'</p>
     <p>'Look again,' said Norman. 'See if you have ever seen him before.'</p>
     <p>Laughing, glancing, and casting down her eyes, she raised them with a sudden start of joy,
      but colouring more deeply, said, 'Indeed, I cannot remember. I dare say I ought.'</p>
     <p>'I think you see a likeness,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'O yes, I see,' she answered, faltering; but perceiving how bright were the looks of both,
      'No? Impossible! Yes it is!'</p>
     <p>'Yes, it is,' said both brothers with one voice.</p>
     <p>She clasped her hands, and absolutely bounded with transport, then grasped both Harry's
      hands, and then Norman's, her whole countenance radiant with joy and sympathy beyond
      expression.</p>
     <p>'Dear, dear Dr. May!' was her first exclamation. 'Oh! how happy you must all be! And
      Margaret?' She looked up at Norman, and came nearer. 'Is not Mr. Ernescliffe come?' she asked
      softly, and trembling.</p>
     <p>'No,' was the low answer, which Harry could not bear to hear, and therefore walked to the
      window. 'No, Meta, but Margaret is much comforted about him. He died in great peace—in his
      arms—' as he signed towards his brother. And as Harry continued to gaze out on the stars of
      gas on the opposite side of the park, he was able to add a few of the particulars.</p>
     <p>Meta's eyes glistened with tears, as she said, 'Perhaps it would have been too perfect if he
      had come; but oh, Norman! how good
      <pb n="538"/> she is to bear it so patiently! And how gloriously he behaved! How can we make
      enough of him! And Flora out! how sorry she will be!'</p>
     <p>'And she never opened Mary's letter,' said Harry, coming back to them.</p>
     <p>'She little thought what it contained,' said Meta. 'Mary's letters are apt to bear keeping,
      you know, and she was so busy, that she laid it aside for a treat after the day's work. But
      there! inhospitable wretch that I am! you have had no dinner!'</p>
     <p>A refection of tea and cold meat was preferred, and in her own pretty manner, Meta lavished
      her welcomes, trying to cover any pain given by Flora's neglect.</p>
     <p>'What makes her so busy?' asked Harry, looking round on the beautifully furnished apartment,
      which, to many eyes besides those fresh from a Milanesian hut, might have seemed a paradise of
      luxurious ease.</p>
     <p>'You don't know what an important lady you have for a sister,' said Meta, merrily.</p>
     <p>'But tell me, what can she have to do? I thought you London ladies had nothing to do, but to
      sit with your hands before you entertaining company.'</p>
     <p>Meta laughed heartily. 'Shall I begin at the beginning? I'll describe to-day then, and you
      must understand that this is what Tom would call a mild specimen—only one evening engagement.
      Though, perhaps, I ought to start from last night at twelve o'clock, when she was at the
      Austrian Ambassador's ball, and came home at two, but she was up by eight—she always manages
      to get through her housekeeping matters before breakfast. At nine, breakfast, and
      baby—by-the-by, you have never inquired for our niece.'</p>
     <p>'I have not come to believe in her yet,' said Harry.</p>
     <p>'Seeing is believing,' said Meta; 'but no, I won't take an unfair advantage over her
      mamma—and she will be fast asleep—I never knew a child sleep as she does. So to go on with our
      day. The papers come, and Miss Leonora is given over to me; for you must know we are wonderful
      politicians. Flora studies all the debates till George finds out what he has heard in the
      House, and baby and I profit. Baby goes out walking, and the post comes. Flora always goes to
      the study with George, and writes, and does all sorts of things for him. She is the most
      useful wife in the world. At twelve, we had our singing lesson—'</p>
     <p>'Singing lesson!' exclaimed Harry.</p>
     <p>'Yes, you know she has a pretty voice, and she is glad to cultivate it. It is very useful at
      parties, but it takes up a great deal of time, and with all I can do to save her in note
      writing, the morning is
      <pb n="539"/> gone directly. After luncheon, she had to ride with George, and came back in a
      hurry to make some canvassing calls about the orphan asylum, and Miss Bracy's sister. If we
      get her in at all, it will be Flora's diplomacy. And there was shopping to do, and when we
      came in hoping for time for our letters, there were the Walkinghames, who staid a long time,
      so that Flora could only despatch the most important notes, before George came in and wanted
      her. She was reading something for him all the time she was dressing, but, as I say, this is
      quite a quiet day.'</p>
     <p>'Stop!' cried Harry, with a gesture of oppression, 'it sounds harder than cleaning knives,
      like aunt Flora! And what is an unquiet day like?'</p>
     <p>'You will see, for we have a great evening party to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'Do you always stay at home?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'Not always, but I do not go to large parties or balls this year,' said Meta, glancing at
      her deep mourning,—'I am very glad of a little time at home.'</p>
     <p>'So you don't like it.'</p>
     <p>'Oh yes! it is very pleasant,' said Meta. 'It is so entertaining when we talk it over
      afterwards, and I like to hear how Flora is admired, and called the beauty of the season. I
      tell George, and we do so gloat over it together! There was an old French Marquis the other
      night, a dear old man, quite of the <hi>ancien régime</hi> , who said she was exactly like the
      portraits of Madame de Maintenon, and produced a beautiful miniature on a snuff-box,
      positively like that very pretty form of face of hers. The old man even declared that Mistress
      Rivers was worthy to be a Frenchwoman.'</p>
     <p>'I should like to kick him!' amiably responded Harry.</p>
     <p>'I hope you won't to-morrow! But don't let us waste our time over this; I want so much to
      hear about New Zealand.'</p>
     <p>Meta was well read in Australasian literature, and drew out a great deal more information
      from Harry, than Norman had yet heard. She made him talk about the Maori pah near his uncle's
      farm, where the Sunday Services were conducted by an old gentleman tattooed elegantly in the
      face, but dressed like an English Clergyman; and tell of his aunt's troubles about the younger
      generation, whom their elders, though Christians themselves, could not educate, and who she
      feared would relapse into heathenism, for want of instruction, though with excellent
      dispositions.</p>
     <p>'How glad you must be that you are likely to go!' exclaimed Meta to Norman, who had sat
      silently listening.</p>
     <p>The sound of the door bell was the first intimation that Harry's histories had occupied them
      until long past twelve o'clock.</p>
     <p>'Now then!' cried Meta, springing forward as if intending to
      <pb n="540"/> meet Flora with the tidings, but checking herself, as if she ought not to be the
      first. There was a pause. Flora was hearing downstairs that Mr. Norman May and another
      gentleman had arrived, and, while vexed at her own omission, and annoyed at Norman's bringing
      friends without waiting for permission, she was yet prepared to be courteous and amiable. She
      entered, in her rich black watered silk, deeply trimmed with lace, and with silver ornaments
      in her dark hair, so graceful and distinguished looking, that Harry stood suspended,
      hesitating, for an instant, whether he beheld his own sister, especially as she made a
      dignified inclination towards him, offering her hand to Norman, as she said 'Meta has told
      you—' but there she broke off, exclaiming, 'Ha! is it possible! No, surely it cannot be—'</p>
     <p>'Miss Walkinghame?' said the sailor, who had felt at home with her at the first word, and
      she flew into his great rough arms.</p>
     <p>'Harry! this is dear Harry! our own dear sailor come back,' cried she, as her husband stood
      astonished; and, springing towards him, she put Harry's hand into his, 'My brother Harry! our
      dear lost one.'</p>
     <p>'Your—brother—Harry,' slowly pronounced George, as he instinctively gave the grasp of
      greeting—'your brother that was lost? Upon my word,' as the matter dawned fully on him, and he
      became eager, 'I am very glad to see you. I never was more rejoiced in my life.'</p>
     <p>'When did you come? Have you been at home?' asked Flora.</p>
     <p>'I came home yesterday—Mary wrote to tell you.'</p>
     <p>'Poor dear old Mary! There's a lesson against taking a letter on trust. I thought it would
      be all Cocksmoor, and would wait for a quiet moment! How good to come to me so soon, you dear
      old shipwrecked mariner.'</p>
     <p>'I was forced to come to report myself,' said Harry, 'or I could not have come away from my
      father so soon.'</p>
     <p>The usual questions and their sad answers ensued, and while Flora talked to Harry, fondly
      holding his hand, Norman and Meta explained the history to George, who no sooner comprehended
      it, than he opined it must have been a horrid nuisance, and that Harry was a gallant fellow;
      then striking him over the shoulder, welcomed him home with all his kind heart, told him he
      was proud to receive him, and falling into a state of rapturous hospitality, rang the bell,
      and wanted to order all sorts of eatables and drinkables, but was sadly baffled to find him
      already satisfied.</p>
     <p>There was more open joy than even at home, and Flora was supremely happy as she sat between
      her brothers, listening and enquiring till far past one o'clock, when she perceived poor
      George
      <pb n="541"/> dozing off, awakened every now and then by a great nod, and casting a wishful
      glance of resigned remonstrance, as if to appeal against sitting up all night.</p>
     <p>The meeting at breakfast was a renewal of pleasure. Flora was proud and happy in shewing off
      her little girl, a model baby, as she called her, a perfect doll for quietness, so that she
      could be brought in at Family Prayers; 'and,' said Flora, 'I am the more glad that she keeps
      no one away, because we can only have Evening Prayers on Sunday. It is a serious thing to
      arrange for such a household.'</p>
     <p>'She is equal to anything,' said George.</p>
     <p>The long file of servants marched in, George read sonorously, and Flora rose from her knees,
      highly satisfied at the impression produced upon her brothers.</p>
     <p>'I like to have the baby with us at breakfast,' she said; 'it is the only time of day when
      we can be sure of seeing anything of her, and I like her nurse to have some respite. Do you
      think her grown, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'Not very much,' said Norman, who thought her more inanimate and like a pretty little waxen
      toy, than when he had last seen her. 'Is she not rather pale?'</p>
     <p>'London makes children pale. I shall soon take her home to acquire a little colour. You must
      know Sir Henry has bitten us with his yachting tastes, and as soon as we can leave London, we
      are going to spend six weeks with the Walkinghames at Ryde, and rival you, Harry. I think Miss
      Leonora will be better at home, so we must leave her there. Lodgings and irregularities don't
      suit people of her age.'</p>
     <p>'Does home mean Stoneborough?' asked Norman.</p>
     <p>'No. Old nurse has one of her deadly prejudices against Preston, and I would not be
      responsible for the consequences of shutting them up in the same nursery. Margaret would be
      distracted between them. No, miss, you shall make her a visit every day, and be fondled by
      your grandpapa.'</p>
     <p>George began a conversation with Harry on nautical matters, and Norman tried to discover how
      Meta liked the yachting project, and found her prepared to think it charming. Hopes were
      expressed that Harry might be at Portsmouth, and a quantity of gay scheming ensued, with
      reiterations of the name of Walkinghame, while Norman had a sense of being wrapped in some
      grey mist, excluding him from participation in their enjoyments, and condemned his own temper,
      as frivolous, for being thus excited to discontent.</p>
     <p>Presently, he heard George insisting that he and Harry should return in time for the evening
      party; and, on beginning to refuse,
      <pb n="542"/> was amazed to find Harry's only objection was on the score of lack of
      uniform.</p>
     <p>'I don't want you in one, sir,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'I have only one coat in the world, besides this,' continued Harry, 'and that is all over
      tar.'</p>
     <p>'George will see to that,' said Flora. 'Don't you think you would be welcome in matting,
      with an orange cowry round your neck?'</p>
     <p>Norman, however, took a private opportunity of asking Harry if he was aware of what he was
      undertaking, and what kind of people they should meet.</p>
     <p>'All English people behave much the same in a room,' said Harry, as if all society, provided
      it was not cannibal, were alike to him.</p>
     <p>'I should have thought you would prefer finding out Forder in his chambers, or going to one
      of the theatres.'</p>
     <p>'As you please,' said Harry; 'but Flora seems to want us, and I should rather like to see
      what sort of company she keeps.'</p>
     <p>Since Harry was impervious to shyness, Norman submitted, and George took them to a
      wonderworker in cloth, who undertook that full equipments should await the young gentleman.
      Harry next despatched his business at the Admiralty, and was made very happy by tidings of his
      friend Owen's safe arrival in America.</p>
     <p>Thence the brothers went to Eton, where home letters had been more regarded; and Dr. May
      having written to secure a holiday for the objects of their visit, they were met at the
      station by the two boys. Hector's red face and prominent light eyebrows were instantly
      recognised; but, as to Tom, Harry could hardly believe that the little, dusty, round-backed
      grub he had left, had been transformed into the well-made gentlemanlike lad before him,
      peculiarly trim and accurate in dress, even to the extent of as much foppery as Eton taste
      permitted.</p>
     <p>Ten minutes had not passed before Tom, taking a survey of the new comer, began to exclaim at
      Norman, for letting him go about such a figure; and, before they knew what was doing, they had
      all been conducted into the shop of the 'only living man who knew how to cut hair.' Laughing
      and good-natured, Harry believed his hair was 'rather long,' allowed himself to be seated, and
      to be divested of a huge superfluous mass of sun-dried curls, which Tom, particularly
      resenting that 'rather long,' kept on taking up, and unrolling from their tight rings, to
      measure the number of inches.</p>
     <p>'That is better,' said he, as they issued from the shop; 'but, as to that coat of yours, the
      rogue who made it should never make another. Where could you have picked it up?'</p>
     <pb n="543"/>
     <p>'At a shop at Auckland,' said Harry, much amused.</p>
     <p>'Kept by a savage?' said Tom, to whom it was no laughing matter. 'See that seam!'</p>
     <p>'Have done, May!' exclaimed Hector. 'He will think you a tailor's apprentice!'</p>
     <p>'Or worse,' said Norman. 'River's tailor kept all strictures to himself.'</p>
     <p>Tom muttered that he only wanted Harry to be fit to be seen by the fellows.</p>
     <p>'The fellows are not such asses as you!' cried Hector. 'You don't deserve that he should
      come to see you. If my—'</p>
     <p>There poor Hector broke off. If his own only brother had been walking beside him, how would
      he not have felt? They had reached their tutor's house, and, opening his own door, he made an
      imploring sign to Harry to enter with him. On the table lay a letter from Margaret, and
      another which Harry had written to him from Auckland.</p>
     <p>'Oh, Harry, you were with him,' he said; 'tell me all about him.'</p>
     <p>And he established himself, with his face hidden on the table, uttering nothing, except, 'Go
      on,' whenever Harry's voice failed in the narration. When something was said of 'all for the
      best,' he burst out, 'He might say so. I suppose one ought to think so. But is not it hard,
      when I had nobody but him? And there was Maplewood; and I might have been so happy there, with
      him and Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'They say nothing could have made Margaret well,' said Harry.</p>
     <p>'I don't care; he would have married her all the same, and we should have made her so happy
      at Maplewood. I hate the place! I wish it were at Jericho!'</p>
     <p>'You are captain of the ship now,' said Harry, 'and you must make the best of it.'</p>
     <p>'I can't. It will never be home. Home is with Margaret, and the rest of them.'</p>
     <p>'So Alan said he hoped you would make it; and you are just like one of us, you know.'</p>
     <p>'What's the use of that, when Captain Gordon will not let me go near you. Taking me to that
      abominable Maplewood last Easter, with half the house shut up, and all horrid! And he is as
      dry as a stick!'</p>
     <p>'The Captain!' cried Harry, angrily. 'There's not a better Captain to sail with in the whole
      navy, and your brother would be the first to tell you so! I'm not discharged yet, Hector—you
      had better look out what you say!'</p>
     <p>'May be, he is the best to sail with, but that is not being the
      <pb n="544"/> best to live with,' said the heir of Maplewood, disconsolately. 'Alan himself
      always said he never knew what home was, till he got to your father and Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'So will you,' said Harry; 'why, my father is your master, or whatever you may call it.'</p>
     <p>'No, Captain Gordon is my guardian.'</p>
     <p>'Eh! what's become of the will then?'</p>
     <p>'What will?' cried Hector. 'Did Alan make one after all?'</p>
     <p>'Aye. At Valparaiso, he had a touch of fever; I went ashore to nurse him, to a merchant's,
      who took us in for love of our Scottish blood. Mr. Ernescliffe made a will there, and left it
      in his charge.'</p>
     <p>'Do you think he made Dr. May my guardian?'</p>
     <p>'He asked me whether I thought he would dislike it, and I told him, no.'</p>
     <p>'That's right!' cried Hector. 'That's like dear old Alan! I shall get back to the Doctor and
      Margaret after all. Mind you write to the Captain, Harry!'</p>
     <p>Hector was quite inspirited and ready to return to the others, but Harry paused to express a
      hope that he did not let Tom make such a fool of himself as he had done to-day.</p>
     <p>'Not he,' said Hector. 'He is liked as much as anyone in the house—he has been five times
      sent up for good. See there in the Eton list! He is a real clever fellow.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, but what's the good of all that, if you let him be a puppy?'</p>
     <p>'Oh, he'll be cured. A fellow that has been a sloven always is a puppy for a bit,' said
      Hector, philosophically.</p>
     <p>Norman was meantime taking Tom to task for these same airs, and, hearing it was from the
      desire to see his brother respectable— Stoneborough men never cared for what they looked like,
      and he must have Harry do himself credit.</p>
     <p>'You need not fear,' said Norman. 'He did not require Eton to make him a gentleman. How now?
      Why Tom, old man, you are not taking that to heart? That's all over long ago.'</p>
     <p>For that black spot in his life had never passed out of the lad's memory, and it might be
      from the lurking want of self-respect that there was about him so much of self-assertion, in
      attention to trifles. He was very reserved, and no one except Norman had ever found the way to
      anything like confidence, and Norman had vexed him by the proposal he had made in the
      holidays.</p>
     <p>He made no answer, but stood looking at Norman with an odd undecided gaze.</p>
     <p>'Well, what now, old fellow?' said Norman, half fearing ' <hi>that</hi> ' might not be
      absolutely over. 'One would think you were not glad to see Harry.'</p>
     <pb n="545"/>
     <p>'I suppose he has made you all the more set upon that mad notion of yours,' said Tom.</p>
     <p>'So far as making me feel that <hi>that</hi> part of the world has a strong claim on us,'
      replied Norman.</p>
     <p>'I'm sure you don't look as if you found your pleasure in it,' cried Tom.</p>
     <p>'Pleasure is not what I seek,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'What is the matter with you?' said Tom. 'You said I did not seem rejoiced—you look worse, I
      am sure.' Tom put his arm on Norman's shoulder, and looked solicitously at him—demonstrations
      of affection very rare with him.</p>
     <p>'I wonder which would really make you happiest, to have your own way, and go to these black
      villains?—'</p>
     <p>'Remember, that but for others who have done so, Harry—'</p>
     <p>'Pshaw,' said Tom, rubbing some invisible dust from his coat sleeve. 'If it would keep you
      at home, I would say I never would hear of doctoring.'</p>
     <p>'I thought you had said so.'</p>
     <p>'What's the use of my coming here, if I'm to be a country doctor?'</p>
     <p>'I have told you I do not mean to victimize you. If you have a distaste to it, there's an
      end of it—I am quite ready.'</p>
     <p>Tom gave a great sigh. 'No,' he said, 'if I must, I must; I don't mind the part of it that
      you do. I only hate the name of it, and the being tied down to a country place like that,
      while you go out thousands of miles off to these savages; but if it is the only thing to
      content you, I wont stand in your way. I can't bear your looking disconsolate.'</p>
     <p>'Don't think yourself bound, if you really dislike the profession.'</p>
     <p>'I don't,' said Tom. 'It is my free choice. If it were not for horrid sick people, I should
      like it.'</p>
     <p>Promising! it must be confessed!</p>
     <p>Perhaps Tom had expected Norman to brighten at once, but it was a fallacious hope. The
      gaining his point involved no pleasant prospect, and his young brother's moody devotion to
      him, suggested scruples whether he ought to exact the sacrifice, though, in his own mind,
      convinced that it was Tom's vocation; and knowing that would give him many of the advantages
      of an eldest son.</p>
     <p>Eton fully justified Hector's declaration that it would not regard the cut of Harry's coat.
      The hero of a lost ship and savage isle, was the object of universal admiration and curiosity,
      and inestimable were the favours conferred by Hector and Tom in giving introductions to him,
      till he had shaken hands with half the school, and departed amid deafening cheers.</p>
     <p>In spite of Harry, the day had been long and heavy to Norman,
      <pb n="546"/> and though he chid himself for his depression, he shrank from the sight of Meta
      and Sir Henry Walkinghame together, and was ready to plead an aching head as an excuse for not
      appearing at the evening party; but, besides that this might attract notice, he thought
      himself bound to take care of Harry in so new a world, where the boy must be at a great
      loss.</p>
     <p>'I say, old June,' cried a voice at his door, 'are you ready?'</p>
     <p>'I have not begun dressing yet. Will you wait?'</p>
     <p>'Not I. The fun is beginning.'</p>
     <p>Norman heard the light foot scampering down-stairs, and prepared to follow, to assume the
      protection of him.</p>
     <p>Music sounded as Norman left his room, and he turned aside to avoid the stream of company
      flowing up the flower-decked stairs, and made his way into the rooms through Flora's boudoir.
      He was almost dazzled by the bright lights, and the gay murmurs of the brilliant throng. Young
      ladies with flowers and velvet streamers down their backs, old ladies portly and bejewelled,
      gentlemen looking civil, abounded wherever he turned his eyes. He could see Flora's graceful
      head bending as she received guest after guest, and the smile with which she answered
      congratulations on her brother's return; but Harry he did not so quickly perceive, and he was
      trying to discover in what corner he might have hidden himself; when Meta stood beside him,
      asking whether their Eton journey had prospered, and how poor Hector was feeling at Harry's
      return?</p>
     <p>'Where is Harry?' asked Norman. 'Is he not rather out of his element?'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed,' said Meta, smiling. 'Why, he is the lion of the night!'</p>
     <p>'Poor fellow, how he must hate it!'</p>
     <p>'Come this way, into the front room. There, look at him—is it not nice to see him, so
      perfectly simple and at his ease, neither shy nor elated? And what a fine-looking fellow he
      is!'</p>
     <p>Meta might well say so. The trim, well-knit broad-chested form, the rosy embrowned honest
      face, the shining light-brown curly locks, the dancing well-opened blue eyes, and merry hearty
      smile showed to the best advantage, in array that even Tom would not have spurned, put on with
      naval neatness; and his attitude and manner were so full of manly ease, that it was no wonder
      that every eye rested on him with pleasure. Norman smiled at his own mistake, and asked who
      were the lady and gentleman conversing with him? Meta mentioned one of the most distinguished
      of English names, and shared his amusement in seeing Harry talking to them with the same frank
      embarrassed ease, as when he had that morning shaken hands with their son, in the capacity of
      Hector
      <pb n="547"/> Ernescliffe's fag. No one present inspired him with a tithe of the awe he felt
      for a post-captain—it was simply a pleasant assembly of good-natured folks, glad to welcome
      home a battered sailor, and of pretty girls, for whom he had a sailor's admiration, but
      without forwardness or presumption—all in happy grateful simplicity.</p>
     <p>'I suppose you cannot dance?' said Flora, to him.</p>
     <p>'I!' was Harry's interjection; and while she was looking round for a partner to whom to
      present him, he had turned to the young daughter of his new acquaintance, and had her on his
      arm, unconscious that George had been making his way to her.</p>
     <p>Flora was somewhat uneasy, but the mother was looking on smiling, and expressed her delight
      in the young midshipman; and Mrs. Rivers, while listening gladly to his praises, watched
      heedfully, and was reassured to see that dancing was as natural to him as everything else; his
      steps were light as a feather, his movement all freedom and joy, without being boisterous, and
      his boyish chivalry as pretty a sight as anyone could wish to see.</p>
     <p>If the rest of the world enjoyed their dances a quarter as much as did "Mr. May," they were
      enviable people, and he contributed not a little to their pleasure, if merely by the sight of
      his blithe freshness, and spirited simplicity, as well as the general sympathy with his
      sister's joy, and the interest in his adventures. He would have been a general favourite, if
      he had been far less personally engaging; as it was, every young lady was in raptures at
      dancing with him, and he did his best to dance with them all; and to try to stir up Norman,
      who, after Meta had been obliged to leave him, and go to act her share of the part of hostess,
      had disposed of himself against a wall, where he might live out the night.</p>
     <p>'Ha! June! what makes you stand sentry there? Come and dance, and have some of the fun! Some
      of those girls are the nicest partners in the world. There's that Lady Alice, something with
      the dangling things in her hair, sitting down now—famous at a polka. Come along, I'll
      introduce you—It will do you good.'</p>
     <p>'I know nothing of dancing,' said Norman, beginning to apprehend that he might be dragged
      off, as often he had been to cricket or foot-ball, and by much the same means.</p>
     <p>'Comes by nature, when you hear the music. Ha! what a delicious polka! Come along, or I must
      be off! She will be waiting for me, and she is the second prettiest girl here! Come!'</p>
     <p>'I have been trying to make something of him, Harry,' said the ubiquitous Flora, 'but I
      don't know whether it is <hi>mauvaise honte</hi> , or headache.'</p>
     <p>'I see! Poor old June!' cried Harry. 'I'll get you an ice at once, old fellow! Nothing like
      one for setting a man going!'</p>
     <pb n="548"/>
     <p>Before Norman could protest, Harry had flown off.</p>
     <p>'Flora,' asked Norman, 'is—are the Walkinghames here?'</p>
     <p>'Yes. Don't you see Sir Henry. That fine-looking man with the black moustache. I want you to
      know him. He is a great admirer of your prize poem, and of Dr. Spencer.'</p>
     <p>Harry returning, administered his ice, and then darted off to excuse himself to his partner,
      by explanations about his brother, whom everybody must have heard of, as he was the cleverest
      fellow living, and had written the best prize poem ever heard at Oxford. He firmly believed
      Norman a much greater lion than himself.</p>
     <p>Norman was forced to leave his friendly corner to dispose of the glass of his ice, and thus
      encountered Miss Rivers, of whom Sir Henry was asking questions about a beautiful collection
      of cameos, which Flora had laid out as a company trap.</p>
     <p>'Here is Norman May,' said Meta—'he knows them better than I do. Do you remember which of
      these is the head of Diana, Norman?'</p>
     <p>Having set the two gentlemen to discuss them, she glided away on fresh hospitable duties,
      while Norman repeated the comments that he had so enjoyed hearing from poor Mr. Rivers, hoping
      he was, at least, sparing Meta some pain, and wondering that Flora should have risked hurting
      her feelings by exposing these treasures to the general gaze.</p>
     <p>If Norman were wearied by Sir Henry, it was his own fault, for the baronet was a very
      agreeable person, who thought a first-class man worth cultivation, so that the last half hour
      might have compensated for all the rest, if conversation were always the test.</p>
     <p>'Why, Meta!' cried Harry, coming up to her, 'you have not once danced! We are a sort of
      brother and sister, to be sure, but that is no hindrance, is it?'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Meta, smiling, 'thank you, Harry, but you must find some one more worthy. I do
      not dance this season; at least, not in public. When we get home, who knows what we may
      do?'</p>
     <p>'You don't dance! Poor little Meta! And you don't go out! What a pity!'</p>
     <p>'I had rather not work quite so hard,' said Meta. 'Think what good fortune I had by staying
      at home last night!'</p>
     <p>'I declare!' exclaimed Harry, bewitched by the beaming congratulation of her look, 'I can't
      imagine why Norman had said you had turned into a fine lady! I can't see a bit of it!'</p>
     <p>'Norman said I had turned into a fine lady!' repeated Meta. 'Why?'</p>
     <p>'Never mind! <hi>I</hi> don't think so; you are just like papa's humming-bird, as you always
      were, not a bit more of a fine lady than
      <pb n="549"/> any girl here, and I am sure papa would say so. Only old June had got a bad
      headache, and is in one of his old dumps, such as I hoped he had left off. But he can't help
      it, poor fellow, and he will come out of it, by-and-by—so never mind. Hollo! why people are
      going away already. There's that girl without anyone to hand her downstairs.'</p>
     <p>Away ran Harry, and presently the brothers and sisters gathered round the fire—George
      declaring that he was glad that nuisance was so well over, and Harry exclaiming, 'Well done,
      Flora! It was capital fun! I never saw a lot of prettier or more good-natured people in my
      life. If I am at home for the Stoneborough ball, I wonder whether my father will let me go to
      it.'</p>
     <p>This result of Harry's successful <hi>début</hi> in high life struck his sister and Norman
      as so absurd that both laughed.</p>
     <p>'What's the matter now?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'Your comparing Flora's party to a Stoneborough ball,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'It is all the same, isn't it?' said Harry. 'I'm sure you are equally disgusted at
      both!'</p>
     <p>'Much you know about it,' said Flora, patting him gaily. 'I'm not going to put conceit in
      that lion head of yours, but you were as good as an Indian prince to my party. Do you know to
      whom you have been talking so coolly?'</p>
     <p>'Of course. You see, Norman, it is just as I told you. All civilized people are just alike
      when they get into a drawing-room.'</p>
     <p>'Harry takes large views of the <hi>Genus homo</hi> ,' Norman exerted himself to say. 'Being
      used to the black and brown species, he takes little heed of the lesser varieties.'</p>
     <p>'It is enough for him that he does not furnish the entertainment in another way,' said
      Flora. 'But, good-night. Meta, you look tired.'</p>

     <p>'I have it!' began Harry, as he came down to breakfast. 'I don't know how I came
      to forget it. The will was to be sent home to Mr. Mackintosh's English partner. I'll go and
      overhaul him this
      <pb n="550"/> very morning. They won't mind my coming by a later train, when there is such a
      reason.'</p>
     <p>'What is his name? Where shall you find him?' asked Flora.</p>
     <p>'I can't be sure; but you've a Navy List of that sort of cattle, have not you, Flora? I'll
      hunt him up.'</p>
     <p>Flora supposed he meant a Directory; and all possible South American merchants having been
      overlooked, and the Mackintoshes selected, he next required a chart of London, and wanted to
      attempt self-navigation, but was forced to accept of George's brougham and escort; Flora would
      not trust him otherwise; and Norman was obliged to go to Oxford at once, hurrying off to his
      train before breakfast was over.</p>
     <p>Flora might have trusted Harry alone. George contributed no more than the dignity of his
      presence; and, indeed, would have resigned the pursuit at the first blunder about the firm;
      and still more when the right one had been found, but the partner proved crusty, and would not
      believe that any such document was in his hands. George was consenting to let it rest till Mr.
      Mackintosh could be written to; but Harry, outrunning his management, and regardless of
      rebuffs, fairly teased the old gentleman into a search, as the only means of getting rid of
      the troublesome sailor.</p>
     <p>In the midst of George's civil regrets at the fruitless trouble they were causing, forth
      came a bundle of papers, and forth from the bundle fell a packet, on which Harry pounced as he
      read, "Will of Alan Halliday Ernescliffe, Esquire, of Maplewood, Yorkshire, Lieutenant in H.
      M. S. Alcestis," and, in the corner, the executors' names, Captain John Gordon, of H. M. S.
      Alcestis; and Richard May, Esquire, M. D., Market Stoneborough.</p>
     <p>As if in revenge, the prudent merchant would not be induced to entrust him with the
      documont, saying he could not give it up till he had heard from the executors, and had been
      certified of the death of the testator. He withstood both the angry gentlemen, who finally
      departed in a state of great resentment—Harry declaring that the old land-lubber would not
      believe that he was his own father's son; and Mr. Rivers, no less incensed, that the House of
      Commons had been insulted in his person, because he did not carry all before him.</p>
     <p>Flora laughed at their story, and told them that she suspected that the old gentleman was in
      the right; and she laid plans for having Harry to teach them yachting at Ryde, while Harry
      declared he would have nothing to do with such trumpery.</p>
     <p>Harry found his home in a sort of agony of expectation, for his non-arrival at the time
      expected had made his first appearance seem like an unsubstantial illusion, though Dr. May, or
      Mary and Aubrey, had been at the station at the coming in of each train. Margaret
      <pb n="551"/> had recovered the effects of the first shock, and the welcome was far more
      joyous than the first had been, with the mixed sensations that were now composed, and shewed
      little, outwardly, but gladness.</p>
     <p>Dr. May took Flora's view of the case, and declared that, if Harry had brought home the
      will, he should not have opened it without his co-executor. So he wrote to the Captain, while
      Harry made the most of his time in learning his sisters over again. He spent a short time
      alone with Margaret every morning, patiently and gently allowing himself to be recalled to the
      sad recollections that were all the world to her. He kept Ethel and Mary merry with his droll
      desultory comments; he made Blanche keep up her dancing; and taught Gertrude to be a thorough
      little romp. As to Dr. May, his patients never were so well or so cheerful, till Dr. Spencer
      and Ethel suspected that the very sight of his looks brightened them— how could they help it?
      Dr. Spencer was as happy as a king in seeing his friend, freed from the heavy weight on his
      spirits; and, truly, it was goodly to watch his perfect look of content, as he leant on his
      lion-faced boy's arm, and walked down to the Minster, whither it seemed to have become
      possible to go on most evenings. Good Dr. May was no musician, but Mr. Wilmot could not regret
      certain tones that now and then burst out in the chanting, from the very bottom of a heart
      that assuredly sang with the full melody of thankfulness, whatever the voice might do.</p>
     <p>Captain Gordon not only wrote but came to Stoneborough, whence Harry was to go with him to
      the court-martial, at Portsmouth.</p>
     <p>The girls wondered that, after writing with so much warmth and affection, both of and to
      Harry, he met him without any demonstration of feeling; and his short peremptory manner
      removed all surprise that poor Hector had been so forlorn with him at Maplewood, and turned,
      with all his heart, to Dr. May. They were especially impressed at the immediate subsidence of
      all Harry's noise and nonsense, as if the drawing-room had been the quarter-deck of the
      Alcestis.</p>
     <p>'And yet,' said Margaret, 'Harry will not hear a single word in dispraise of him. I do
      believe he loves him with all his heart.'</p>
     <p>'I think,' said Ethel, 'that in a strong character, there is an exulting fear in looking up
      to a superior, in whose justice there is perfect reliance. It is a germ of the higher
      feeling.'</p>
     <p>'I believe you are right,' said Margaret; 'but it is a serious thing for a man to have so
      little sympathy with those below him. You see how Hector feels it, and I now understand how it
      told upon Alan, and how papa's warmth was like a surprise to him.</p>
     <p>'Because Captain Gordon had to be a father to them, and that is
      <pb n="552"/> more than a captain. I should not wonder if there were more similarity and
      fellow-feeling between him and Harry than there could be with either of them. Harry, though he
      has all papa's tenderness, is of a rougher sort that likes to feel itself mastered. Poor
      Hector! I wonder if he is to be given back to us.'</p>
     <p>'Do you know—when—whether they will find out this morning?' said Margaret, catching her
      dress nervously, as she was moving away.</p>
     <p>'Yes, I believe so. I was not to have told you, but—'</p>
     <p>'There is no reason that it should do me any harm,' said Margaret, almost smiling, and
      looking as if she was putting a restraint on something she wished to say. 'Go down, dear
      Ethel—Aubrey will be waiting for you.'</p>
     <p>Ethel went down to the difficult task of hearing Aubrey's lessons, while Harry was
      pretending to write to Mrs. Arnott, but, in reality, teaching Gertrude the parts of a ship,
      occasionally acting mast, for her to climb.</p>
     <p>By-and-by, Dr. May came in. 'Margaret not down-stairs yet?' he said.</p>
     <p>'She is dressed, but will not come down till the evening,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I'll go to her. She will be pleased. Come up presently, Ethel. Or, where's Richard?'</p>
     <p>'Gone out,' said Harry. 'What, is it anything left to her?'</p>
     <p>'The best, the best!' said Dr. May. 'Ethel, listen—twenty thousand, to build and endow a
      Church for Cocksmoor!'</p>
     <p>No need to bid Ethel listen. She gave a sort of leap in her chair, then looked almost ready
      to faint.</p>
     <p>'My dear child,' said her father, 'this <hi>is</hi> your wish. I give you joy, indeed I
      do!'</p>
     <p>Ethel drew his arm round her, and leant against him.</p>
     <p>'My wish! my wish!' she repeated, as if questioning the drift of the words.</p>
     <p>'I'm glad it is found!' cried Harry. 'Now I know why he talked of Cocksmoor, and seemed to
      rest in planning for it. You will mind the roof is as he said.'</p>
     <p>'You must talk to Dr. Spencer about that,' said Dr. May. 'The Captain means to leave it
      entirely in our hands.'</p>
     <p>'Dear Alan!' exclaimed Ethel. 'My wish! O yes, but how gained? Yet, Cocksmoor with a Church!
      I don't know how to be glad enough, and yet—'</p>
     <p>'You shall read the sentence,' said Dr. May. "'In testimony of thankfulness for mercy
      vouchsafed to him here—" poor dear boy!'</p>
     <pb n="553"/>
     <p>'What does the Captain say?' asked Harry.</p>
     <p>'He is rather astounded, but he owns that the estate can bear it, for old Halliday had saved
      a great deal, and there will be more before Hector comes of age.'</p>
     <p>'And Hector?'</p>
     <p>'Yes, we get him back. I am fellow-trustee with Captain Gordon, and as to personal
      guardianship, I fancy the Captain found he could not make the boy happy, and thinks you no bad
      specimen of our training.'</p>
     <p>'Famous!' cried Harry. 'Hector will hurrah now! Is that all?'</p>
     <p>'Except legacies to Captain Gordon, and some Scottish relations. But poor Margaret ought to
      hear it. Ethel, don't be long in coming.'</p>
     <p>With all Ethel's reputation for bluntness, it was remarkable how her force of character made
      her always called for whenever there was the least dread of a scene.</p>
     <p>She turned abruptly from Harry; and, going outside the window, tried to realize and
      comprehend the tidings, but all she could have time to discover was that Alan's memory was
      dearer to her than ever, and she was obliged to hasten up-stairs.</p>
     <p>Her father quitted the room by one door, as she entered by the other; she believed that it
      was to hide his emotion, but Margaret's fair wan face was beaming with the sweetest of
      congratulating smiles.</p>
     <p>'I thought so,' she said, as Ethel came in. 'Dear Ethel, are you not glad?'</p>
     <p>'I think I am,' said Ethel, putting her hands to her brow.</p>
     <p>'You think!' exclaimed Margaret, as if disappointed.</p>
     <p>'I beg your pardon,' said Ethel, with quivering lip. 'Dear Margaret, I am glad—don't you
      believe I am, but somehow, it is harder to deal with joy than grief. It confuses one! Dear
      Alan—and then to have been set on it so long—to have prayed so for it, and to have it come in
      this way—by your—'</p>
     <p>'Nay, Ethel, had he come home, it was his great wish to have done it. He used to make
      projects when he was here, but he would not let me tell you, lest he should find duties at
      Maplewood—whereas this would have been his pleasure.'</p>
     <p>'Dear Alan!' repeated Ethel. 'If you are so kind, so dear as to be glad, Margaret, I think I
      shall be so presently.'</p>
     <p>Margaret almost grudged the lack of the girlish outbreak of rejoicing which would once have
      forgotten everything in the ecstacy of the fulfilled vision. It did not seem to be what Alan
      had intended; he had figured to himself unmixed joy, and she wanted to see it, and something
      of the wayward impatience of weakness throbbed at her heart, as Ethel paced the room, and
      disappeared in her own curtained recess.</p>
     <pb n="554"/>
     <p>Presently she came back saying, 'You are sure you are glad?'</p>
     <p>'It would be strange if I were not,' said Margaret. 'See, Ethel, here are blessings
      springing up from what I used to think had served for nothing but to bring him pain and grief.
      I am so thankful that he could express his desire, and so grateful to dear Harry for bringing
      it to light. How much better it is than I ever thought it could be! He has been spared
      disappointment, and surely the good that he will have done will follow him.'</p>
     <p>'And you?' said Ethel, sadly.</p>
     <p>'I shall lie here and wait,' said Margaret. 'I shall see the plans, and hear all about it,
      and oh!' her eyes lighted up, 'perhaps some day, I may hear the bell.'</p>
     <p>Richard's tap interrupted them. 'Had he heard?'</p>
     <p>'I have.' The deepened colour in his cheek betrayed how much he felt, as he cast an anxious
      glance towards Margaret—an enquiring one on Ethel.</p>
     <p>'She is so pleased,' was all Ethel could say.</p>
     <p>'I thought she would be,' said Richard, approaching. 'Captain Gordon seemed quite vexed that
      no special token of remembrance was left to her.'</p>
     <p>Margaret smiled in a peculiar way. 'If he only knew how glad I am there was not.'</p>
     <p>And Ethel knew that the Church was his token to Margaret, and that any "fading frail
      memorial" would have lessened the force of the signification.</p>
     <p>Ethel could speak better to her brother than to her sister. 'O Richard! Richard! Richard!'
      she cried, and a most unusual thing with both, she flung her arms round his neck. 'It is come
      at last! If it had not been for you, this would never have been. How little likely it seemed,
      that dirty day, when I talked wildly, and you checked me!'</p>
     <p>'You had faith and perseverance,' said Richard, 'or—'</p>
     <p>'You are right,' said Margaret, as Ethel was about to disclaim. 'It was Ethel's steadiness
      that brought it before Alan's mind. If she had yielded when we almost wished it, in the time
      of the distress about Mrs. Green, I do believe that all would have died away!'</p>
     <p>'I didn't keep steady—I was only crazy. You and Ritchie and Mr. Wilmot—' said Ethel,
      half-crying; then, as if unable to stay, she exclaimed with a sort of petulance, 'And there's
      Harry playing all sorts of rigs with Aubrey! I shan't get any more sense out of him
      to-day!'</p>
     <p>And away she rushed to the wayfaring dust of her life of labour, to find Aubrey and Daisy
      half-way up the tulip tree, and Harry mischievously unwilling to help them down again,
      assuring her that
      <pb n="555"/> such news deserved a holiday, and that she was growing a worse Tartar than Miss
      Winter. She had better let the poor children alone, put on her bonnet, and come with him to
      tell Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>Whereat Ethel was demurring, when Dr. May came forth, and declared he should take her
      himself.</p>
     <p>Poor Mr. Wilmot laboured under a great burthen of gratitude, which no one would receive from
      him. Dr. May and Ethel repudiated thanks almost with terror; and, when he tried them with the
      Captain, he found very doubtful approval of the whole measure, so that Harry alone was a ready
      acceptant of a full meed of acknowledgments for his gallant extraction of the will.</p>
     <p>No one was more obliged to him than Hector Ernescliffe, who wrote to Margaret that it would
      be very jolly to come <hi>home</hi> again, and that he was delighted that the Captain could
      not hinder either that or Cocksmoor Church. 'And as to Maplewood, I shall not hate it so much,
      if that happens which I hope will happen.' Of which oracular sentence, Margaret could make
      nothing.</p>
     <p>The house of May felt more at their ease when the uncongenial Captain had departed, although
      he carried off Harry with him. There was the better opportunity for a tea-drinking
      consultation with Dr. Spencer and Mr. Wilmot, when Margaret lay on her sofa, looking better
      than for months past, and taking the keenest interest in every arrangement.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer, whose bright eyes glittered at every mention of the subject, assumed that he
      was to be the architect, while Dr. May was assuring him that it was a maxim that no one unpaid
      could be trusted; and when he talked of beautiful German Churches with pierced spires,
      declared that the building must not make too large a hole in the twenty thousand, at the
      expense of future Curates, because Richard was the first.</p>
     <p>'I'll be prudent, Dick,' said Dr. Spencer. 'Trust me not to rival the Minster.'</p>
     <p>'We shall find work next for you there,' said Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>'Aye, we shall have May out of his family packing-box before many years are over his
      head.'</p>
     <p>'Don't mention it,' said Dr. May; 'I know what I exposed myself to in bringing Wilmot
      here.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Dr. Spencer, 'we shall put you in the van when we attack the Corporation
      pen.'</p>
     <p>'I shall hold by the good old cause. As if the galleries had not been there before you were
      born!'</p>
     <p>'As if poor people had a right to sit in their own Church!' said Ethel.</p>
     <pb n="556"/>
     <p><hi>'Sit</hi> , you may well say,' said Mr. Wilmot. 'As if anyone could do otherwise, with
      those ingenious traps for hindering kneeling.'</p>
     <p>'Well, well, I know the people must have room,' said Dr. May, cutting short several further
      attacks which he saw impending.</p>
     <p>'Yes, you would like to build another blue gallery, blocking up another window, and with
      Richard May and Christopher Tomkins, Churchwardens, on it, in orange-coloured letters—the
      Rivers' colours. No disrespect to your father, Miss May, but, as a general observation, it is
      a property of Town Councillors to be conservative only where they ought not.'</p>
     <p>'I brought you here to talk of building a Church, not of pulling one to pieces.'</p>
     <p>Poor Dr. May, he knew it was inevitable and quite right, but his affectionate heart and
      spirit of perpetuity, which had an association connected with every marble cloud, green-baize
      pew, and square-headed panel, anticipated tortures in the general sweep, for which his
      ecclesiastical taste and sense of propriety would not soon compensate.</p>
     <p>Margaret spared his feelings by bringing the Cocksmoor subject back again; Dr. Spencer
      seemed to comprehend the ardour with which she pressed it on, as if it were very near her
      heart that there should be no delay. He said he could almost promise her that the first stone
      should be laid before the end of the summer, and she thanked him in her own warm sweet way,
      hoping that it would be while Hector and Harry were at home.</p>
     <p>Harry soon returned, having gone through the Court Martial with the utmost credit, been
      patronized by Captain Gordon in an unheard-of manner, asked to dine with the Admiral, and
      promised to be quickly afloat again. Ere many days had passed, he was appointed to one of the
      finest vessels in the fleet, commanded by a Captain to whom Captain Gordon had introduced him,
      and, who "seemed to have taken a fancy to him," as he said. The Bucephalus, now the object of
      his pride, was refitting, and his sisters hoped to see a good deal of him before he should
      again sail. Besides, Flora would be at Ryde before the end of July.</p>
     <p>It was singular that Ethel's vision should have been fulfilled simultaneously with Flora's
      having obtained a position so far beyond what could have been anticipated.</p>
     <p>She was evidently extremely happy and valuable, much admired and respected, and with full
      exercise for the energy and cleverness, which were never more gratified than by finding scope
      for action. Her husband was devotedly attached to her, and was entirely managed by her, and
      though her good judgment kept her
      <pb n="557"/> from appearing visibly in matters not pertaining to her own sphere, she was, in
      fact, his understanding. She read, listened, and thought for him, imbued him with her own
      views, and composed his letters for him; ruling his affairs, both political and private, and
      undeniably making him fill a position, which, without her, he would have left vacant; nor was
      there any doubt that he was far happier for finding himself of consequence, and being no
      longer left a charge upon his own hands. He seemed fully to suffice to her as a companion,
      although she was so far superior in power; for it was, perhaps, her nature to love best that
      which depended upon her, and gave her a sense of exercising protection; as she had always
      loved Margaret better than Ethel.</p>
     <p>"Mrs. Rivers was an admirable woman." So everyone felt, and her youthful beauty and success
      in the fashionable world, made her qualities, as a wife and mistress of a household, the more
      appreciated. She never set aside her religious habits or principles, was an active member of
      various charitable associations, and found her experience of the Stoneborough Ladies'
      Committee applicable among far greater names. Indeed, Lady Leonora thought dear Flora Rivers'
      only fault, her over strictness, which encouraged Meta in the same, but there were points that
      Flora could not have yielded on any account, without failing in her own eyes.</p>
     <p>She made time for everything, and though, between business and fashion, she seemed to
      undertake more than mortal could accomplish, it was all effected, and excellently. She did,
      indeed, sigh over the briefness of the time that she could bestow on her child or on home
      correspondence, and declared that she should rejoice in rest; but, at the same time, her
      achievements were a positive pleasure to her.</p>
     <p>Meta, in the meantime, had been living passively on the most affectionate terms with her
      brother and sister, and though often secretly yearning after the dear old father, whose
      darling she had been, and longing for power of usefulness, she took it on trust that her
      present lot had been ordered for her, and was thankful, like the bird of Dr. May's fable, for
      the pleasures in her path—culling sweet morals, and precious thoughts out of book, painting or
      concert, occasions for Christian charities in each courtesy of society, and opportunities for
      cheerful selfdenial and submission, whenever any little wish was thwarted.</p>
     <p>So Norman said she had turned into a fine lady! It was a sudden and surprising intimation,
      and made a change in the usually bright and calm current of her thoughts. She was not aware
      that there had been any alteration in herself, and it was a revelation that set her to examine
      where she had changed—poor little thing! She was not angry, she did not resent the charge, she
      took it for
      <pb n="558"/> granted that, coming from such a source, it must be true and reasonable—and what
      did it mean? Did they think her too gay, or neglectful of old friends? What had they been
      saying to Harry about her?</p>
     <p>'Ah!' thought Meta, 'I understand it. I am living a life of ease and uselessness, and with
      his higher aims and nobler purposes, he shrinks from the frivolities among which I am cast. I
      saw his saddened countenance among our gaieties, and I know that to deep minds there is
      heaviness in the midst of display. He withdraws from the follies that have no charms for him,
      and I—ought I to be able to help being amused? I don't seek these things, but, perhaps, I
      ought to avoid them more than I do—If I could be quite clear what is right, I should not care
      what effort I made. But I was born to be one of those who have trial of riches, and such
      blessed tasks are not my portion. But if he sees the vanities creeping into my heart, I should
      be grateful for that warning.'</p>
     <p>So meditated Meta, as she copied one of her own drawings of the Grange, for her dear old
      governess, Mrs. Larpent, while each line and tint recalled the comments of her fond amateur
      father, and the scenery carried her home, in spite of the street sounds, and the scratching of
      Flora's pen, coursing over note paper. Presently, Sir Henry Walkinghame called, bringing a
      beautiful bouquet.</p>
     <p>'Delicious,' cried Meta. 'See, Flora, it is in good time, for those vases were sadly
      shabby.'</p>
     <p>She began at once to arrange the flowers, a task that seemed what she was born for, and the
      choice roses and geraniums acquired fresh grace as she placed them in the slender glasses and
      classic vases; but Flora's discerning eyes perceived some mortification on the part of the
      gentleman, and, on his departure, playfully reproached Meta for ingratitude.</p>
     <p>'Did we not thank him? I thought I did them all due honour, actually using the Dresden
      bowl.'</p>
     <p>'You little wretch! quite insensible to the sentiment of the thing.'</p>
     <p>'Sentiment! One would think you had been reading about the language of flowers!'</p>
     <p>'Whatever there was, poor Sir Henry did not mean it for the Dresden bowl, or Bohemian
      glass.'</p>
     <p>'Flora! do pray tell me whether you are in fun?'</p>
     <p>'You ridiculous child!' said Flora, kissing her earnest forehead, inging the bell, and
      gathering up her papers, as she walked out of the room, and gave her notes to the servant.</p>
     <p>'What does she mean? Is it play? O no, a hint would be far more like her. But I hope it is
      nonsense. He is very kind and constant, and I should not know what to do.'</p>
     <pb n="559"/>
     <p>Instances of his complaisance towards herself rose before her, so as to excite some warmth
      and gratitude. Her lonely heart thrilled at the idea of being again the best beloved, and her
      energetic spirit bounded at the thought of being no longer condemned to a life of idle ease.
      Still it was too new a light to her to be readily accepted, after she had looked on him so
      long, merely as a familiar of the house, attentive to her, because she fell to his share, when
      Flora was occupied. She liked him, decidedly; she could possibly do more; but she was far more
      inclined to dread, than to desire, any disturbance of their present terms of intercourse.</p>
     <p>'However,' thought she, 'I must see my way. If he should have any such thing in his head, to
      go on as we do now would be committing myself, and I will not do that, unless I am sure it is
      right. O papa! you would settle it for me! But I will have it out with Flora. She will find
      out what I cannot—how far he is a man for whom one ought to care. I do not think Norman liked
      him, but then Norman has so keen a sense of the world-touched. I suppose I am that! If any
      other life did but seem appointed for me, but one cannot tell what is thwarting providential
      leading, and if this be as good a man as—What would Ethel say? If I could but talk to Dr. May!
      But Flora I will catch, before I see him again, that I may know how to behave.'</p>
     <p>Catching Flora was not the easiest thing in the world, among her multifarious occupations;
      but Meta was not the damsel to lose an opportunity for want of decision.</p>
     <p>Flora saw what was coming, and was annoyed with herself for having given the alarm; but,
      after all, it must have come some time or other, though she had rather that Meta had been more
      involved first.</p>
     <p>It should be premised that Mrs. Rivers had no notion of the degree of attachment felt by her
      brother for Meta; she only knew that Lady Leonora had a general distrust of her family, and
      she felt it a point of honour to promote no dangerous meetings, and to encourage Sir Henry—a
      connection who would be most valuable, both as conferring importance upon George in the
      county, and as being himself related to persons of high influence, whose interest might push
      on her brothers. Preferment for Richard; promotion for Harry; nay, diplomatic appointments for
      Tom, came floating before her imagination, even while she smiled at her Alnaschar visions.</p>
     <p>But the tone of Meta, as she drew her almost forcibly into her room, shewed her that she had
      given a great shock to her basket.</p>
     <p>'Flora, if you would only give me a minute, and would tell me—'</p>
     <pb n="560"/>
     <p>'What?' asked Flora, not inclined to spare her blushes.</p>
     <p>'Whether, whether you meant anything in earnest?'</p>
     <p>'My dear little goose, did no one ever make an innocent joke in their lives before?'</p>
     <p>'It was very silly of me,' said Meta; but you gave me a terrible fright.</p>
     <p>'Was it so very terrible, poor little bird?' said Flora, in commiseration. 'Well then, you
      may safely think of him as a man tame about the house. It was much prettier of you not to
      appropriate the flowers, as any other damsel would have done.'</p>
     <p>'Do you really and truly think—' began Meta; but, from the colour of her cheek, and the
      timid resolution of her tone, Flora thought it safest not to hear the interrogation, and
      answered, 'I know what he comes here for—it is only as a refuge from his mother's friend, old
      Lady Drummond, who would give the world to catch him for her daughters—that's all. Put my
      nonsense out of your head, and be yourself, my sweet one.'</p>
     <p>Flora had never gone so near an untruth, as when she led Meta to believe this was the sole
      reason. But, after all, what did Flora herself <hi>know</hi> to the contrary?'</p>
     <p>Meta recovered her ease, and Flora marked, as weeks passed on, that she grew more accustomed
      to Sir Henry's attentions. A little while, and she would find herself so far bound by the
      encouragement she had given, that she could not reject him.</p>
     <p>'My dear,' said George, 'when do you think of going down to take the baby to the Grange? She
      looks dull, I think.'</p>
     <p>'Really, I think it is hardly worth while to go down <hi>en masse</hi> ,' said Flora. 'These
      last debates may be important, and it is a bad time to quit one's post. Don't you think
      so?'</p>
     <p>'As you please—the train is a great bore.'</p>
     <p>'And we will send the baby down the last day before we go to Ryde, with Preston and Butts to
      take care of her. We can't spare him to take them down, till we shut up the house. It is so
      much easier for us to go to Portsmouth from hence.'</p>
     <p>The lurking conviction was, that one confidential talk with Ethel, would cause the
      humming-bird to break the toils that were being wound invisibly round her. Ethel and her
      father knew nothing of the world, and were so unreasonable in their requirements! Meta would
      consult them all, and all her scruples would awaken, and perhaps Dr. Spencer might be
      interrogated on Sir Henry's life abroad, where Flora had a suspicion that gossip had best not
      be raked up.</p>
     <p>Not that she concealed anything positively known to her, or that she was not acting just as
      she would have done by her own child.
      <pb n="561"/> She found herself happily married to one whom home notions would have rejected,
      and she believed Meta would be perfectly happy with a man of decided talent, honour, and
      unstained character, even though he should not come up to her father's or Ethel's
      standard.</p>
     <p>If Meta were to marry as they would approve, she would have far to seek among "desirable
      connections." Meantime, was not Flora acting with exemplary judgment and selfdenial?</p>
     <p>So she wrote that she could not come home; Margaret was much disappointed, and so was Meta,
      who had looked to Ethel to unravel the tangles of her life.</p>
     <p>'No, no, little Miss,' said Flora to herself; 'you don't talk to Ethel till your fate is
      irrevocable. Why, if I had listened to her, I should be thankful to be singing at Mrs.
      Hoxton's parties at this minute! and, as for herself, look at Norman Ogilvie! No, no, after
      six weeks' yachting—moonlight, sea, and sympathy—I defy her to rob Sir Henry of his prize!
      And, with Meta lady of Cocksmoor, even Ethel herself must be charmed!'</p>

     <p>'Papa , here is a message from Flora for you,' said Margaret, holding up a letter;
      'she wants to know whom to consult about the baby.'</p>
     <p>'Ha! what's the matter?'</p>
     <p>Margaret read—'Will you ask papa whom I had better call in to see the baby. There does not
      seem to be anything positively amiss, but I am not happy about her. There is a sleepiness
      about her which I do not understand, and, when roused, she is fretful, and will not be amused.
      There is a look in her eyes which I do not like, and I should wish to have some advice for
      her. Lady Leonora recommends Mr. —, but I always distrust people who are very much the rage,
      and I shall send for no one without papa's advice.'</p>
     <p>'Let me see!' said Dr. May, startled, and holding out his hand
      <pb n="562"/> for the letter.—'A look about the eyes! I shall go up and see her myself. Why
      has not she brought her home?'</p>
     <p>'It would have been far better,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'Sleepy and dull! She was as lively a child when they took her away, as I ever saw. What! is
      there no more about her? The letter is crammed with somebody's <hi>fête</hi> —vote of want of
      confidence —debate last night. What is she about? She fancies she knows everything, and, the
      fact is, she knows no more about infants—I could see that, when the poor little thing was a
      day old!'</p>
     <p>'Do you think there is cause for fear?' said Margaret, anxiously.</p>
     <p>'I can't tell. With a first child, one can't guess what may be mamma's fancy, or what may be
      serious. But Flora is not too fanciful, and I must see her for my own satisfaction. Let some
      one write, and say I will come up to-morrow by the twelve o'clock train—and mind she opens the
      letter.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May kept his word, and the letter had evidently not been neglected; for George was
      watching for him at the station, and thanked him so eagerly for coming, that Dr. May feared
      that he was indeed needed, and inquired anxiously.</p>
     <p>'Flora is uneasy about her—she seems heavy, and cries when she is disturbed,' replied
      George. 'Flora has not left her to-day, and hardly yesterday.'</p>
     <p>'Have you had no advice for her?'</p>
     <p>'Flora preferred waiting till you should come.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May made an impatient movement, and thought the way long, till they were set down in
      Park Lane. Meta came to meet them on the stairs, and said that the baby was just the same, and
      Flora was in the nursery, and thither they hastily ascended.</p>
     <p>'O papa! I am so glad you are come!' said Flora, starting up from her low seat, beside the
      cradle.</p>
     <p>Dr. May hardly paused to embrace his daughter, and she anxiously led him to the cradle, and
      tried to read his expression, as his eyes fell on the little face, somewhat puffed, but of a
      waxy whiteness, and the breathing seeming to come from the lips.</p>
     <p>'How long has she been so?' he asked, in a rapid, professional manner.</p>
     <p>'For about two or three hours. She was very fretful before, but I did not like to call in
      anyone, as you were coming. Is it from her teeth?' said Flora, more and more alarmed by his
      manner. 'Her complexion is always like that—she cannot bear to be disturbed—' added she, as
      the child feebly moaned, on Dr. May beginning to take her from her cradle; but, without
      attending to the objection, he lifted her up, so that she lay as quietly as before, on his
      arm. Flora had trusted that hope and confidence would come with him;
      <pb n="563"/> but, on the contrary, every lurking misgiving began to rush wildly over her, as
      she watched his countenance, while he carried his little grand-daughter towards the light,
      studied her intently, raised her drooping eyelids, and looked into her eyes, scarcely
      eliciting another moan. Flora dared not ask a question, but looked on with eyes open, as it
      were, stiffened.</p>
     <p>'This is the effect of opium!' were Dr. May's first words, breaking on all with startling
      suddenness; but, before anyone could speak, he added, 'We must try some stimulant, directly;'
      then looking round the room, 'What have you nearest?'</p>
     <p>'Godfrey's Cordial, sir,' quickly suggested the nurse.</p>
     <p>'Aye—anything to save time—she is sinking for want of the drug that has—' he broke off to
      apportion the dose, and to hold the child in a position to administer it—Flora tried to give
      it—the nurse tried—in vain.</p>
     <p>'Do not torment her further,' said the Doctor, as Flora would have renewed the trial—'it
      cannot be done. What have you all been doing?' cried he, as, looking up, his face changed from
      the tender compassion with which he had been regarding his little patient, into a look of
      strong indignation, and one of his sentences of hasty condemnation broke from him, as it would
      not have done, had Flora been less externally calm. 'I tell you this child has been destroyed
      with opium!'</p>
     <p>They all recoiled; the father turned fiercely round on the nurse, with a violent
      exclamation, but Dr. May checked him. 'Hush! This is no presence for the wrath of man.' The
      solemn tone seemed to make George shrink into an awestruck quiescence; he stood motionless and
      transfixed, as if indeed conscious of some overwhelming presence.</p>
     <p>Flora had come near, with an imploring gesture, to take the child in her own arms; but Dr.
      May, by a look of authority, prevented it; for, indeed, it would have been harassing and
      distressing the poor little sufferer again to move her, as she lay with feeble gasps on his
      arm.</p>
     <p>So they remained, for what space no one knew—not one word was uttered—not a limb moved, and
      the street noises sounded far off.</p>
     <p>Dr. May stooped his head closer to the babe's face, and seemed listening for a breath, as he
      once more touched the little wrist—he took away his finger, he ceased to listen, he looked
      up.</p>
     <p>Flora gave one cry—not loud, not sharp, but 'an exceeding bitter cry'—she would have moved
      forward, but reeled, and her husband's arms supported her as she sank into a swoon.</p>
     <p>'Carry her to her room,' said Dr. May. 'I will come'—and, when
      <pb n="564"/> George had borne her away, he kissed the lifeless cheek, and reverently placed
      the little corpse in the cradle; but, as he rose from doing so, the sobbing nurse exclaimed,
      'Oh! sir! oh! sir, indeed, I never did—'</p>
     <p>'Never did what?' said Dr. May, sternly.</p>
     <p>'I never gave the dear baby anything to do her harm,' cried Preston, vehemently.</p>
     <p>'You gave her this,' said Dr. May, pointing to the bottle of Godfrey's Cordial.</p>
     <p>He could say no more, for her master was hurrying back into the room. Anger was the first
      emotion that possessed him, and he hardly gave an answer to Dr. May's question about Flora.
      'Meta is with her! Where is that woman? Have you given her up to the police?'</p>
     <p>Preston shrieked and sobbed, made incoherent exclamations, and was much disposed to cling to
      the Doctor.</p>
     <p>'Silence!' said Dr. May, lifting his hand, and assuming a tone and manner that awed them
      both, by reminding them that death was present in the chamber; and, taking his son-in-law out,
      and shutting the door, he said, in a low voice, 'I believe this is no case for the police—have
      mercy on the poor woman.'</p>
     <p>'Mercy—I'll have no mercy on my child's murderer! You said she had destroyed my child.'</p>
     <p>'Ignorantly.'</p>
     <p>'I don't care for ignorance! She destroyed her—I'll have justice,' said George,
      doggedly.</p>
     <p>'You shall,' said Dr. May, laying his hand on his arm; 'but it must be investigated, and you
      are in no state to investigate. Go down-stairs—do not do anything till I come to you.'</p>
     <p>His peremptory manner imposed on George, who, nevertheless, turned round as he went, saying,
      with a fierce glare in his eyes, 'You will not let her escape.'</p>
     <p>'No. Go down—be quiet.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May returned to Preston, and had to assure her that Mr. Rivers was not gone to call the
      police, before he could bring her to any degree of coherence. She regarded him as her only
      friend, and soon undertook to tell the whole truth, and he perceived that it was, indeed, the
      truth. She had not known that the cordial was injurious, deeming it a panacea against
      fretfulness, precious to nurses, but against which ladies always had a prejudice, and,
      therefore, to be kept secret. Poor little Leonora had been very fretful and uneasy when
      Flora's many avocations had first caused her to be set aside, and Preston had had recourse to
      the remedy which, lulling her successfully, was applied with less moderation
      <pb n="565"/> and judgment than would have been shewn by a more experienced person, till
      gradually the poor child became dependant on it for every hour of rest. When her mother, at
      last, became aware of her unsatisfactory condition, and spent her time in watching her, the
      nurse being prevented from continuing her drug, she was, of course, so miserable without it,
      that Preston had ventured on proposing it, to which Mrs. Rivers had replied with displeasure
      sufficient to prevent her from declaring how much she had previously given. Preston was in an
      agony of distress for her little charge, as well as of fear for herself, and could hardly
      understand what her error had been. Dr. May soon saw that, though not highly principled, her
      sorrow was sincere, and that she still wept bitterly over the consequences of her treatment,
      when he told her that she had nothing to fear from the law, and that he would protect her from
      Mr. Rivers.</p>
     <p>Her confession was hardly over, when Meta knocked at the door, pale and frightened. 'Oh! Dr.
      May, do come to poor Flora! I don't know what to do, and George is in such a state!'</p>
     <p>Dr. May made a sound of sorrow and perplexity, and Meta, as she went down before him, asked,
      in a low, horror-stricken whisper, 'Did Preston really—'</p>
     <p>'Not knowingly,' said Dr. May. 'It is the way many children have gone; but I never
      thought—'</p>
     <p>They had come to Flora's dressing-room. Her bed-room door was open, and George was pacing
      heavily up and down the length of both apartments, fiercely indignant. 'Well!' said he,
      advancing eagerly on Dr. May, 'has she confessed?'</p>
     <p>'But Flora!' said Dr. May, instead of answering him.</p>
     <p>Flora lay on her bed, her face hidden on her pillow, only now and then moaning.</p>
     <p>'Flora! my poor, poor child!' said her father, bending down to raise her, and taking her
      hand.</p>
     <p>She moved away, so as to bury her face more completely, but there was life in the movement,
      and he was sufficiently reassured on her situation to be able to attend to George, who was
      only impatient to rush off to take his revenge. He led him into the outer room, where Meta was
      waiting, and forced upon his unwilling conviction that it was no case for the law. The child
      had not been killed by any one dose, but had rather sunk from the want of stimulus, to which
      she had been accustomed. As to any pity for the woman, George would not hear of it. She was
      still, in his eyes, the destroyer of his child; and, when he found the law would afford him no
      vengeance, he insisted that she should be turned out of his house at once.</p>
     <p>'George!' called a hollow voice from the next room, and, hurrying
      <pb n="566"/> back, they saw Flora sitting up, and, as well as trembling limbs allowed,
      endeavouring to rise to her feet, while burning spots were in her cheeks. 'George, turn me out
      of the house too! If Preston killed her, I did!' and she gave a ghastly laugh.</p>
     <p>George threw his arms round her, and laid her on her bed again, with many fond words, and
      strength which she had not power to withstand. Dr. May, in the meantime, spoke quickly to
      Meta, in the doorway. 'She must go. They cannot see her again; but has she any friends in
      London?'</p>
     <p>'I think not.'</p>
     <p>'Find out. She must not be sent adrift. Send her to the Grange, if nothing better offers.
      You must judge.'</p>
     <p>He felt that he could confide in Meta's discretion and promptitude, and returned to the
      parents.</p>
     <p>'Is she gone?' said George, in a whisper, which he meant should be unheard by his wife, who
      had sunk her face in her pillows again.</p>
     <p>'Going. Meta is seeing to it.'</p>
     <p>'And that woman gets off free!' cried George, 'while my poor little girl—' and, no longer
      occupied by the hope of retribution, he gave way to an overpowering burst of grief.</p>
     <p>His wife did not rouse herself to comfort him, but still lay motionless, excepting for a
      convulsive movement, that passed over her frame at each sound from him, and her father felt
      her pulse bound at the same time with corresponding violence, as if each of his deep-drawn
      sobs were a mortal thrust. Going to him, Dr. May endeavoured to repress his agitation, and
      lead him from the room; but he could not, at first, prevail on him to listen or understand,
      still less, to quit Flora. The attempt to force on him the perception that his uncontrolled
      sorrow was injuring her, and that he ought to bear up for her sake, only did further harm;
      for, when he rose up and tried to caress her, there was the same torpid, passive resistance,
      the same burying her face from the light, and the only betrayal of consciousness in the
      agonized throbs of her pulse.</p>
     <p>He became excessively distressed at being thus repelled, and, at last, yielded to the
      impatient signals of Dr. May, who drew him into the next room, and, with brief, strong, though
      most affectionate and pitying words, enforced on him that Flora's brain—nay, her life, was
      risked, and that he must leave her alone to his care for the present. Meta coming back at the
      same moment, Dr. May put him in her charge, with renewed orders to impress on him how much
      depended on tranquillity.</p>
     <p>Dr. May went back, with his soft, undisturbing, physician's footfall, and stood at the side
      of the bed, in such intense anxiety as
      <pb n="567"/> those only can endure who know how to pray, and to pray in resignation and
      faith.</p>
     <p>All was still in the darkening twilight; but the distant roar of the world surged without,
      and a gas-light shone flickering through the branches of the trees, and fell on the rich dress
      spread on the couch, and the ornaments on the toilette-table. There was a sense of oppression,
      and of being pursued by the incongruous world, and Dr. May sighed to silence all around, and
      see his poor daughter in the calm of her own country air; but she had chosen for herself, and
      here she lay, stricken down in the midst of the prosperity that she had sought.</p>
     <p>He could hear every respiration, tightened and almost sobbing, and he was hesitating whether
      to run the risk of addressing her; when, as if it had occurred to her suddenly that she was
      alone and deserted, she raised up her head with a startled movement, but, as she saw him, she
      again hid her face, as if his presence were still more intolerable than solitude.</p>
     <p>'Flora! my own, my dearest—my poor child! you should not turn from me. Do I not carry with
      me the like self-reproachful conviction?'</p>
     <p>Flora let him turn her face towards him and kiss her forehead. It was burning, and he
      brought water and bathed it, now and then speaking a few fond, low, gentle words, which,
      though she did not respond, evidently had some soothing effect; for she admitted his services,
      still, however, keeping her eyes closed, and her face turned towards the darkest side of the
      room. When he went towards the door, she murmured, 'Papa!' as if to detain him.</p>
     <p>'I am not going, darling. I only wanted to speak to George.'</p>
     <p>'Don't let him come!' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Not till you wish it, my dear.'</p>
     <p>George's step was heard; his hand was on the lock, and again Dr. May was conscious of the
      sudden rush of blood through all her veins. He quickly went forward, met him, and shut him
      out, persuading him, with difficulty, to remain outside, and giving him the occupation of
      sending out for an anodyne—since the best hope, at present, lay in encouraging the torpor that
      had benumbed her crushed faculties.</p>
     <p>Her father would not even venture to rouse her to be undressed; he gave her the medicine,
      and let her lie still, with as little movement as possible, standing by till her regular
      breathings shewed that she had sunk into a sleep; when he went into the other room and found
      that George had also forgotten his sorrows in slumber on the sofa, while Meta sat sadly
      presiding over the tea equipage.</p>
     <p>She came up to meet him, her question expressed in her looks.</p>
     <pb n="568"/>
     <p>'Asleep,' he said; 'I hope the pulses are quieter. All depends on her wakening.'</p>
     <p>'Poor, poor Flora,' said Meta, wiping away her tears.</p>
     <p>'What have you done with the woman?'</p>
     <p>'I sent her to Mrs. Larpent's. I knew she would receive her and keep her till she could
      write to her friends. Bellairs took her, but I could hardly speak to her—'</p>
     <p>'She did it ignorantly,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I could never be so merciful and forbearing as you,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'Ah! my dear, you will never have the same cause!'</p>
     <p>They could say no more, for George awoke, and the argument of his exclusion had to be gone
      through again. He could not enter into it by any means; and when Dr. May would have made him
      understand that poor Flora could not acquit herself of neglect, and that even his affection
      was too painful for her in the present state; he broke into a vehement angry defence of her
      devotion to her child, treating Dr. May as if the accusation came from him; and when the
      Doctor and Meta had persuaded him out of this, he next imagined that his father-in-law feared
      that he was going to reproach his wife; and there was no making him comprehend more than, that
      if she were not kept quiet, she might have a serious illness.</p>
     <p>Even then, he insisted on going to look at her, and Dr. May could not prevent him from
      pressing his lips to her forehead. She half-opened her eyes, and murmured "good-night," and by
      this he was a little comforted; but he would hear of nothing but sitting up, and Meta would
      have done the same, but for an absolute decree of the Doctor.</p>
     <p>It was a relief to Dr. May, that George's vigil soon became a sound repose on the sofa in
      the dressing-room; and he was left to read and muse uninterruptedly.</p>
     <p>It was far past two o'clock before there was any movement; then Flora drew a long breath,
      stirred, and, as her father came and drew her hand into his, before she was well awake, she
      gave a long, wondering whisper—'Oh! papa! papa!' then sitting up, and passing her hand over
      her eyes, 'Is it all true?'</p>
     <p>'It is true,' my own poor dear,' said Dr. May, supporting her, as she rested against his
      arm, and hid her face on his shoulder, while her breath came short, and she shivered under the
      renewed perception, 'She is gone to wait for you.'</p>
     <p>'Hush! Oh don't! papa!' said Flora, her voice shortened by anguish. 'O, think why—'</p>
     <p>'Nay, Flora, do not, do not speak as if <hi>that</hi> should exclude peace, or hope!' said
      Dr. May, entreatingly. 'Besides, it was no wilful neglect—you had other duties—'</p>
     <pb n="569"/>
     <p>'You don't know me, papa!' said Flora, drawing her hands away from him, and tightly
      clenching them in one another, as thoughts far too terrible for words swept over her.</p>
     <p>'If I do not, the most Merciful Father does,' said Dr. May. Flora sat for a minute or two,
      her hands locked together round her knees, her head bowed down, her lips compressed. Her
      father was so far satisfied, that the bodily dangers he had dreaded, were averted; but the
      agony of mind was far more terrible, especially in one who expressed so little, and in whom it
      seemed, as it were, pent up.</p>
     <p>'Papa!' said Flora, presently, with a resolution of tone as if she would prevent resistance;
      'I must see her!'</p>
     <p>'You shall, my dear,' said the Doctor, at once; and she seemed grateful not to be opposed,
      speaking more gently, as she said, 'May it be now? While there is no daylight!'</p>
     <p>'If you wish it,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>The dawn, and a yellow waning moon, gave sufficient light for moving about, and Flora gained
      her feet; but she was weak and trembling, and needed the support of her father's arm, though
      hardly conscious of receiving it, as she mounted the same stairs, that she had so often
      lightly ascended in the like doubtful morning light; for never, after any party, had she
      omitted her visit to the nursery.</p>
     <p>The door was locked, and she looked piteously at her father as her weak push met the
      resistance, and he was somewhat slow in turning the key with his left hand. The whitewashed,
      slightly furnished room, reflected the light, and the moonbeams shewed the window-frame in
      pale and dim shades on the blinds, the dewy air breathed in coolly from the park, and there
      was a calm solemnity in the atmosphere—no light, no watcher present to tend the babe. Little
      Leonora needed such no more; she was with the Keeper, who shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
     <p>So it thrilled across her grandfather, as he saw the little cradle drawn into the middle of
      the room, and, on the coverlet, some pure white rosebuds and lilies of the valley, gathered in
      the morning by Mary and Blanche, little guessing the use that Meta would make of them ere
      nightfall.</p>
     <p>The mother sank on her knees, her hands clasped over her breast, and rocking herself to and
      fro uneasily, with a low, irrepressible moaning.</p>
     <p>'Will you not see her face?' whispered Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'I may not touch her,' was the answer, in the hollow voice; and, with the wild eye that had
      before alarmed him, but trusting to the soothing power of the mute face of the innocent, he
      drew back the covering.</p>
     <pb n="570"/>
     <p>The sight was such as he anticipated, sadly lovely, smiling and tranquil—all oppression and
      suffering fled away for ever.</p>
     <p>It stilled the sounds of pain, and the restless motion; the compression of the hands became
      less tight, and he began to hope that the look was passing into her heart. He let her kneel on
      without interruption, only once he said, "Of such is the kingdom of Heaven!"</p>
     <p>She made no immediate answer, and he had had time to doubt whether he ought to let her
      continue in that exhausting attitude any longer, when she looked up and said, 'You will all be
      with her there.'</p>
     <p>She has flown on to point your aim more stedfastly,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>Flora shuddered, but spoke calmly—'No, I shall not meet her.'</p>
     <p>'My child!' he exclaimed, 'do you know what you are saying?'</p>
     <p>'I know, I am not in the way,' said Flora, still in the same fearfully quiet,
      matter-of-fact, tone. 'I never have been'—and she bent over her child, as if taking her leave
      for eternity.</p>
     <p>His tongue almost clave to the roof of his mouth, as he heard the words—words elicited by
      one of those hours of true reality that, like death, rend aside every wilful cloak of
      self-deceit, and self-approbation. He had no power to speak at first; when he recovered it,
      his reply was not what his heart had, at first, prompted.</p>
     <p>'Flora! How has this dear child been saved?' he said. 'What has released her from the guilt
      she inherited through you, through me, through all? Is not the Fountain open?'</p>
     <p>'She never wasted grace,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'My child! my Flora!' he exclaimed, losing the calmness he had gained by such an effort;
      'You must not talk thus—it is wrong! Only your own morbid feeling can treat this—
       <hi>this</hi> —as a charge against you, and if it were, indeed'—he sank his voice— that such
      consequences destroyed hope, oh Flora! where should I be?'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Flora, 'this is not what I meant. It is that I have never set my heart right. I
      am not like you nor my sisters. I have seemed to myself, and to you, to be trying to do right,
      but it was all hollow, for the sake of praise and credit. I know it, now it is too late; and
      He has let me destroy my child here, lest I should have destroyed her Everlasting Life, like
      my own.'</p>
     <p>The most terrible part of this sentence was to Dr. May, that Flora spoke as if she knew it
      all as a certainty, and without apparent emotion, with all the calmness of despair. What she
      had never guessed before had come clearly and fully upon her now, and without apparent
      novelty, or, perhaps, there had been misgivings in
      <pb n="571"/> the midst of her complacent self-satisfaction. She did not even seem to perceive
      how dreadfully she was shocking her father, whose sole comfort was in believing her language
      the effect of exaggerated self-reproach. His profession had rendered him not new to the sight
      of despondency, and, dismayed as he was, he was able at once to speak to the point.</p>
     <p>'If it were indeed so, her removal would be the greatest blessing.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said her mother, and her assent was in the same tone of resigned despair, owning it
      best for her child to be spared a worldly education, and loving her truly enough to
      acquiesce.</p>
     <p>'I meant the greatest blessing to you,' continued Dr. May, 'if it be sent to open your eyes,
      and raise your thoughts upwards. Oh! Flora, are not afflictions tokens of infinite love?'</p>
     <p>She could not accept the encouragement, and only formed, with her lips, the words, 'Mercy to
      her—wrath to me!'</p>
     <p>The simplicity and hearty piety which, with all Dr. May's faults, had always been part of
      his character, and had borne him, in faith and trust, through all his trials, had never
      belonged to her. Where he had been sincere, erring only from impulsiveness, she had been
      double-minded and calculating; and, now that her delusion had been broken down, she had
      nothing to rest upon. Her whole religious life had been mechanical, deceiving herself more
      than even others, and all seemed now swept away, except the sense of hypocrisy, and of having
      cut herself off, for ever, from her innocent child. Her father saw that it was vain to argue
      with her, and only said, 'You will think otherwise by-and-by, my dear. Now, shall I say a
      prayer before we go down?'</p>
     <p>As she made no reply, he repeated the Lord's Prayer, but she did not join; and then he added
      a broken, hesitating intercession for the mourners, which caused her to bury her face deeper
      in her hands, but her dull wretchedness altered not.</p>
     <p>Rising, he said, authoritatively, 'Come, Flora, you must go to bed. See, it is morning.'</p>
     <p>'You have sat up all night with me!' said Flora, with somewhat of her anxious, considerate
      self.</p>
     <p>'So has George. He had just dropped asleep on the sofa when you awoke.'</p>
     <p>'I thought he was in anger,' said she.</p>
     <p>'Not with you, dearest.'</p>
     <p>'Not, I remember now, not where it was justly due. Papa,' she said, pausing, as to recall
      her recollection, 'what did I do? I must have done something very unkind to make him go away
      and leave me.'</p>
     <p>'I insisted on his leaving you, my dear. You seemed oppressed,
      <pb n="572"/> and his affectionate ways were doing you harm; so I was hard-hearted, and turned
      him out, sadly against his will.'</p>
     <p>'Poor George!' said Flora, 'has he been left to bear it alone all this time? How much
      distressed he must have been. I must have vexed him grievously. You don't guess how fond he
      was of her. I must go to him at once.'</p>
     <p>'That is right, my dear.'</p>
     <p>'Don't praise me,' said she, as if she could not bear it. 'All that is left for me is to do
      what I can for him.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May felt cheered. He was sure that hope must again rise out of unselfish love and
      duty.</p>
     <p>Their return awoke George, who started, half-sitting up, wondering why he was spending the
      night in so unusual a manner, and why Flora looked so pale, in the morning light, with her
      loosened, drooping hair.</p>
     <p>She went straight to him, and, kneeling by his side, said, 'George, forgive!' The same
      moment he had caught her to his bosom; but so impressed was his tardy mind, with the peril of
      talking to her, that he held her in his arms without a single word, till Dr. May had unclosed
      his lips—a sign would not suffice—he must have a sentence to assure him; and then it was such
      joy to have her restored, and his fondness and solicitude were so tender and eager in their
      clumsiness, that his father-in-law was touched to the heart.</p>
     <p>Flora was quite herself again, in presence of mind and power of dealing with him; and Dr.
      May left them to each other, and went to his own room, for such rest as sorrow, sympathy, and
      the wakening city, would permit him.</p>
     <p>When the house was astir for the morning kept by human creatures, and the Doctor had met
      Meta in the breakfast-room, and held with her a sad, affectionate conversation, George came
      down with a fair report of his wife, and took her father to see her.</p>
     <p>That night had been like an illness to her, and, though perfectly composed, she was feeble
      and crushed, keeping the room darkened, and reluctant to move or speak. Indeed, she did not
      seem able to give her attention to anyone's voice, except her husband's. When Dr. May, or
      Meta, spoke to her, she would miss what they said, beg their pardon, and ask them to repeat
      it; and, sometimes, even then, become bewildered. They tried reading to her, but she did not
      seem to listen, and her half-closed eye had the expression of listless dejection, that her
      father knew betokened that, even as last night, her heart refused to accept promises of
      comfort as meant for her.</p>
     <p>For George, however, her attention was always ready, and was perpetually claimed. He was
      forlorn and at a loss without her, every moment; and, in the sorrow which he too felt most
      acutely,
      <pb n="573"/> could not have a minute's peace unless soothed by her presence; he was dependant
      on her to a degree which amazed and almost provoked the Doctor, who could not bear to have her
      continually harassed and disturbed, and yet was much affected by witnessing so much
      tenderness, especially in Flora, always the cold utilitarian member of his family.</p>
     <p>In the middle of the day, she rose and dressed, because George was unhappy at having to sit
      without her, though only in the next room. She sat in the large arm-chair, turned away from
      the blinded windows, never speaking nor moving, save when he came to her, to make her look at
      his letters and notes, when she would, with the greatest patience and sweetness, revise them,
      suggest word or sentence, rouse herself to consider each petty detail, and then sink back into
      her attitude of listless dejection. To all besides, she appeared totally indifferent; gently
      courteous to Meta and to her father, when they addressed her, but otherwise shewing little
      consciousness whether they were in the room; and yet, when something was passing about her
      father's staying or returning, she rose from her seat, came up to him before he was aware, and
      said, 'Papa! papa! you will not leave me!' in such an imploring tone, that if he had ever
      thought of quitting her, he could not have done so.</p>
     <p>He longed to see her left to perfect tranquillity, but such could not be in London. Though
      theirs was called a quiet house, the rushing stream of traffic wearied his country ears, the
      door-bell seemed ceaselessly ringing, and though Meta bore the brunt of the notes and
      messages, great numbers necessarily came up to Mr. Rivers, and of these Flora was not spared
      one. Dr. May had his share too of messages and business, and friends and relations, the
      Rivers' kindred, always ready to take offence with their rich connections, and who would not
      be satisfied with enquiries at the door, but must see Meta, and <hi>would</hi> have George
      fetched down to them—old aunts, who wanted the whole story of the child's illness, and came
      imagining there was something to be hushed up; Lady Leonora extremely polite, but extremely
      disgusted at the encounter with them; George ready to be persuaded to take everyone up to see
      his wife, and the prohibition to be made by Dr. May over and over again—it was a most tedious,
      wearing afternoon, and at last, when the visitors had gone, and George had hurried back to his
      wife, Dr. May threw himself into an arm-chair and said, 'Oh! Meta, sorrow weighs more heavily
      in town than in the country!'</p>
     <p>'Yes!' said Meta. 'If one only could go out and look at the flowers, and take poor Flora up
      a nosegay!'</p>
     <p>'I don't think it would make much difference to her,' sighed the Doctor.</p>
     <pb n="574"/>
     <p>'Yes, I think it would,' said Meta; 'it did to me. The sights there speak of the better
      sights.'</p>
     <p>'The power to look must come from within,' said Dr. May, thinking of his poor daughter.</p>
     <p>'Aye,' said Meta, 'as Mr. Ernescliffe said, "heaven is as near—!" But the skirts of heaven
      are more easily traced in our mountain view, than here, where, if I looked out of window, I
      should only see that giddy string of carriages and people pursuing each other!'</p>
     <p>'Well, we shall get her home as soon as she is able to move, and I hope it may soothe her.
      What a turmoil it is! There has not been one moment without noise in the twenty-two hours I
      have been here!'</p>
     <p>'What would you say if you were in the City?'</p>
     <p>'Ah! there's no talking of it, but if I had been a fashionable London physician, as my
      father-in-law wanted to make me, I should have been dead long ago!'</p>
     <p>'No, I think you would have liked it very much.'</p>
     <p>'Why?'</p>
     <p>'Love's a flower that will not die,' repeated Meta, half smiling. 'You would have found so
      much good to do—'</p>
     <p>'And so much misery to rend one's heart,' said Dr. May. 'But, after all, I suppose there is
      only a certain capacity of feeling.'</p>
     <p>'It is within, not without, as you said,' returned Meta.</p>
     <p>'Ha! there's another!' cried Dr. May, almost petulant at the sound of the bell again,
      breaking into the conversation that was a great refreshment.</p>
     <p>'It was Sir Henry Walkinghame's ring,' said Meta. 'It is always his time of day.'</p>
     <p>The Doctor did not like it the better.</p>
     <p>Sir Henry sent up a message to ask whether he could see Mr. or Miss Rivers.</p>
     <p>'I suppose we must,' said Meta, looking at the Doctor. 'Lady Walkinghame must be anxious
      about Flora.'</p>
     <p>She blushed greatly, fancying that Dr. May was putting his own construction on the
      heightened colour which she could not control. Sir Henry came in, just what he ought to be,
      kindly anxious, but not overwhelming, and with a ready, pleased recognition of the Doctor, as
      an old acquaintance of his boyhood. He did not stay many minutes; but there was a perceptible
      difference between his real sympathy and friendly regard only afraid of obtruding, and the
      oppressive curiosity of their former visitors. Dr. May felt it due, both from kindness and
      candour, to say something in his praise when he was gone.</p>
     <pb n="575"/>
     <p>'That is a sensible superior man,' he said. 'He will be an acquisition when he takes up his
      abode at Drydale.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Meta—a very simple yes—from which nothing could be gathered.</p>
     <p>The funeral was fixed for Monday, the next day but one, at the Church where Mr. Rivers had
      been buried. No one was invited to be present; Ethel wrote that, much as she wished it, she
      could not leave Margaret, and, as the whole party were to return home on the following day,
      they should soon see Flora.</p>
     <p>Flora had laid aside all privileges of illness after the first day; she came down-stairs to
      breakfast and dinner, and though looking wretchedly ill, and speaking very low and feebly, she
      was as much as ever the mistress of her house. Her father could never draw her into
      conversation again, on the subject nearest his heart, and could only draw the sad conclusion
      that her state of mind was unchanged, from the dreary indifference with which she allowed
      every word of cheer to pass by unheeded, as if she could not bear to look beyond the grave. He
      had some hope in the funeral, which she was bent on attending, and more in the influence of
      Margaret, and the counsel of Richard, or of Mr. Wilmot.</p>
     <p>The burial, however, failed to bring any peaceful comfort to the mourning mother. Meta's
      tears flowed freely, as much for her father as for her little niece; and George's sobs were
      deep and choking; but Flora, externally, only seemed absorbed in helping him to go through
      with it; she, herself, never lost her fixed, composed, hopeless look.</p>
     <p>After her return, she went up to the nursery, and deliberately set apart and locked up every
      possession of her child's, then, coming down, startled Meta by laying her hand on her shoulder
      and saying, 'Meta, dear, Preston is in the housekeeper's room. Will you go and speak to her
      for a moment, to reassure her before I come?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Flora!'</p>
     <p>'I sent for her,' said Flora, in answer. 'I thought it would be a good opportunity while
      George is out. Will you be kind enough to prepare her, my dear?'</p>
     <p>Meta wondered how Flora had known whither to send, but she could not but obey. Poor Preston
      was an ordinary sort of woman, kind-hearted, and not without a conscience; but her error had
      arisen from the want of any high religious principle to teach her obedience, or sincerity. Her
      grief was extreme, and she had been so completely overcome by the forbearance and
      consideration shewn to her, that she was even more broken-hearted by the thought of them, than
      by the terrible calamity she had occasioned.</p>
     <p>Kind-hearted Mrs. Larpent had tried to console her, as well as
      <pb n="576"/> to turn the misfortune to the best account, and Dr. May had once seen her, and
      striven gently to point out the true evil of the course she had pursued. She was now going to
      her home, and they augured better of her, that she had been as yet too utterly downcast to say
      one word of that first thought with a servant, her character.</p>
     <p>Meta found her sobbing uncontrollably at the associations of her master's house, and
      dreadfully frightened at hearing that she was to see Mrs. Rivers; she began to entreat to the
      contrary with the vehemence of a person unused to any self-government; but, in the midst, the
      low calm tones were heard, and her mistress stood before her—her perfect stillness of
      demeanour, far more effective in repressing agitation, than had been Meta's coaxing attempts
      to soothe.</p>
     <p>'You need not be afraid to see me, Preston,' said Flora, kindly. 'I am very sorry for
      you—you knew no better, and I should not have left so much to you.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! ma'am—so kind—the dear, dear little darling—I shall never forgive myself.'</p>
     <p>'I know you did love her,' continued Flora. 'I am sure you intended no harm, and it was my
      leaving her that made her fretful.'</p>
     <p>Preston tried to thank.</p>
     <p>'Only remember henceforth—' and the clear tone grew fainter than ever with internal anguish,
      though still steady, 'Remember strict obedience and truth henceforth; the want of them will
      have worse results by-and-by than even this. Now, Preston, I shall always wish you well. I
      ought not, I believe, to recommend you to the like place, without saying why you left me, but
      for any other I will give you a fair character. I will see what I can do for you, and if you
      are ever in any distress, I hope you will let me know. Have your wages been paid?'</p>
     <p>There was a sound in the affirmative, but poor Preston could not speak. 'Good-bye then,' and
      Flora took her hand and shook it. 'Mind you let me hear if you want help. Keep this.'</p>
     <p>Meta was a little disappointed to see sovereigns, instead of a book. Flora turned to go, and
      put her hand out to lean on her sister as for support; she stood still to gather strength
      before ascending the stairs, and a groan of intense misery was wrung from her.</p>
     <p>'Dearest Flora, it has been too much!'</p>
     <p>'No,' said Flora, gently.</p>
     <p>'Poor thing, I am glad for her sake. But might she not have a book—a Bible?'</p>
     <p>'You may give her one, if you like. I could not.'</p>
     <p>Flora reached her own room, went in, and bolted the door.</p>

     <p>It had been with a gentle sorrow that Etheldred had expected to go and lay in her
      resting-place, the little niece, who had been kept from the evil of the world, in a manner of
      which she had little dreamt. Poor Flora! she must be ennobled, she thought, by having a child
      where hers is, when she is able to feel anything but the first grief; and Ethel's heart
      yearned to be trying, at least, to comfort her, and to be with her father, who had loved his
      grandchild so fondly.</p>
     <p>It was not to be. Margaret had borne so many shocks with such calmness, that Ethel had no
      especial fears for her; but there are some persons who have less fortitude for others than for
      themselves, and she was one of these. Flora had been her own companion-sister, and the baby
      had been the sunbeam of her life, during the sad winter and spring.</p>
     <p>In the middle of the night, Ethel knocked at Richard's door. Margaret had been seized with
      faintness, from which they could not bring her back; and, even when Richard had summoned Dr.
      Spencer, it was long ere his remedies took effect; but, at last, she revived enough to thank
      them, and say she was glad that papa was not there.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer sent them all to bed, and the rest of the night was quiet; but Margaret could
      not deny, in the morning, that she felt terribly shattered, and she was depressed in spirits
      to a degree such as they had never seen in her before. Her whole heart was with Flora; she was
      unhappy at being at a distance from her, almost fretfully impatient for letters, and insisting
      vehemently on Ethel's going to London.</p>
     <p>Ethel had never felt so helpless and desolate, as with Margaret thus changed and broken, and
      her father absent.</p>
     <p>'My dear,' said Dr. Spencer, 'nothing can be better for both parties than that he should be
      away. If he were here, he ought to leave all attendance to me, and she would suffer from the
      sight of his distress.'</p>
     <pb n="578"/>
     <p>'I cannot think what he will do or feel?' sighed Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Leave it to me. I will write to him, and we shall see her better before post time.'</p>
     <p>'You will tell him exactly how it was, or I shall,' said Ethel, abruptly, not to say
      fiercely.</p>
     <p>'Ho! you don't trust me?' said Dr. Spencer, smiling, so that she was ashamed of her speech.
      'You shall speak for yourself, and I for myself; and I shall say that nothing would so much
      hurt her as to have others sacrificed to her.'</p>
     <p>'That is true,' said Ethel; 'but she misses papa.'</p>
     <p>'Of course she does; but, depend on it, she would not have him leave your sister, and she is
      under less restraint without him.</p>
     <p>'I never saw her like this!'</p>
     <p>'The drop has made it overflow. She has repressed more than was good for her, and now that
      her guard is broken down, she gives way under the whole weight.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Margaret! I am pertinacious; but, if she is not better by post time, papa will not
      bear to be away.'</p>
     <p>'I'll tell you what I think of her by that time. Send up your brother Richard, if you wish
      to do her good. Richard would be a much better person to write than yourself. I perceive that
      he is the reasonable member of the family.'</p>
     <p>'Did not you know that before?'</p>
     <p>'All I knew of him, till last night, was, that no one could, by any possibility, call him
      Dick.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer was glad to have dismissed Ethel smiling; and she was the better able to bear
      with poor Margaret's condition of petulance. She had never before experienced the effects of
      bodily ailments on the temper, and she was slow to understand the change in one usually so
      patient and submissive. She was, by turns, displeased with her sister and with her own
      abruptness; but, though she knew it not, her bluntness had a bracing effect. She thought she
      had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to harp on her going to London; but it made
      Margaret feel that she had been unreasonable, and keep silence.</p>
     <p>Richard managed her much better, being gentle and firm, and less ready to speak than Ethel,
      and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep, which restored her balance, and so relieved
      Ethel, that she not only allowed Dr. Spencer to say what he pleased, but herself made light of
      the whole attack, little knowing how perilous was any shock to that delicate frame.</p>
     <p>Margaret's whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview with Flora; and,
      though she had returned to her usual state, she would not go down-stairs on the evening the
      party were
      <pb n="579"/> expected, believing it would be more grateful to her sister's feelings to meet
      her without witnesses.</p>
     <p>The travellers arrived, and Dr. May hurried up to her. She barely replied to his caresses
      and enquiries in her eagerness to hear of Flora, and to convince him that he must not forbid
      the meeting. Nor had he any mind so to do. 'Surely,' said he, when he had seen the
      spiritualized look of her glistening blue eyes, the flush on her transparent cheeks, and her
      hands clasped over her breast, 'surely poor Flora must feel as though an angel were waiting to
      comfort her.'</p>
     <p>Flora came, but there was sore disappointment. Fond and tender she was as ever, but, neither
      by word nor gesture, would she admit the most remote allusion to her grief. She withdrew her
      hand when Margaret's pressure became expressive; she avoided her eye, and spoke incessantly of
      indifferent subjects. All the time, her voice was low and hollow, her face had a settled
      expression of wretchedness, and her glances wandered drearily and restlessly anywhere but to
      Margaret's face; but her steadiness of manner was beyond her sister's power to break, and her
      visit was shortened on account of her husband. Poor George had quite given way at the sight of
      Gertrude, whom his little girl had been thought to resemble; and, though Dr. May had soothed
      him almost like a child, no one put any trust in his self-control, and all sat round, fearing
      each word or look, till Flora came down-stairs, and they departed.</p>
     <p>Richard and Ethel each offered to go with them; they could not bear to think of their
      spending that first evening in their childless home, but Flora gently, but decidedly refused;
      and Dr. May said that, much as he wished to be with them, he believed that Flora preferred
      having no one but Meta. 'I hope I have done Margaret no harm,' were Flora's last words to him,
      and they seemed to explain her guarded manner; but he found Margaret weeping as she had never
      wept for herself, and palpitation and faintness were the consequence.</p>
     <p>Ethel looked on at Flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the weeks that ensued. There
      were few opportunities of being alone together, and Flora shrank from such as there were—nay,
      she checked all expression of solicitude, and made her very kisses rapid and formal.</p>
     <p>The sorrow that had fallen on the Grange seemed to have changed none of the usual habits
      there—visiting, riding, driving, dinners, and music, went on with little check. Flora was sure
      to be found the animated, attentive lady of the house, or else sharing her husband's pursuits,
      helping him with his business, or assisting him
      <pb n="580"/> in seeking pleasure, spending whole afternoons at the coachmaker's, over a
      carriage that they were building, and, it was reported, playing <hi>ecarté</hi> in the
      evening.</p>
     <p>Had grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any mission? Yet Ethel could
      not believe that the presence of the awful messenger was unfelt, when she heard poor George's
      heavy sigh, or when she looked at Flora's countenance, and heard the peculiar low, subdued
      tone of her voice, which, when her words were most cheerful, always seemed to Ethel the
      resigned accent of despair.</p>
     <p>Ethel could not talk her over with Margaret, for all seemed to make it a point that Margaret
      should believe the best. Dr. May turned from the subject with a sort of shuddering grief, and
      said, 'Don't talk of her, poor child—only pray for her!'</p>
     <p>Ethel, though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer, was somewhat consoled by
      perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung up between her father and his poor
      daughter. If Flora had seemed, in her girlhood, to rate him almost cheaply, this was at an end
      now; she met him as if his embrace were peace, the gloom was lightened, the attention less
      strained, when he was beside her, and she could not part with him without pressing for a
      speedy meeting. Yet, she treated him with the same reserve; since that one ghastly revelation
      of the secrets of her heart, the veil had been closely drawn, and he could not guess whether
      it had been but a horrible thought, or were still an abiding impression. Ethel could gather no
      more than that her father was very unhappy about Flora, and that Richard understood why; for
      Richard had told her that he had written to Flora, to try to persuade her to cease from this
      reserve, but that he had no reply.</p>
     <p>Norman was not at home; he had undertaken the tutorship of two school-boys for the holidays;
      and his father owned, with a sigh, that he was doing wisely.</p>
     <p>As to Meta, she was Ethel's chief consolation, by the redoubled assurances, directed to
      Ethel's unexpressed dread, lest Flora should be rejecting the chastening Hand. Meta had the
      most absolute certainty that Flora's apparent cheerfulness was all for George's sake, and that
      it was a most painful exertion. 'If Ethel could only see how she let herself sink together as
      it were, and her whole countenance relax, as soon as he was out of sight,' Meta said, 'she
      could not doubt what misery these efforts were to her.'</p>
     <p>'Why does she go on with them?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'George,' said Meta. 'What would become of him without her? If he misses her for ten
      minutes, he roams about lost, and he cannot enjoy anything without her. I cannot think how he
      can
      <pb n="581"/> help seeing what hard work it is, and how he can be contented with those
      dreadful sham smiles; but as long as she can give him pleasure, poor Flora will toil for
      him.'</p>
     <p>'It is very selfish,' Ethel caught herself saying.</p>
     <p>'No, no, it is not,' cried Meta. 'It is not that he will not see, but that he cannot see.
      Good honest fellow, he really thinks it does her good and pleases her. I was so sorry one
      evening when I tried to take her place at that perpetual <hi>ecarté</hi> , and told him it
      teased her; he went so wistfully to her, and asked whether it did, and she exerted herself
      into such painful enjoyment to persuade him to the contrary; and afterwards she said to me,
      "Let me alone, dearest— is the only thing left me."'</p>
     <p>'There is something in being husband and wife that one cannot understand,' slowly said
      Ethel, so much in her quaint way, that Meta laughed.</p>
     <p>Had it not been for Norman's absence, Ethel would, in the warm sympathy and accustomed
      manner of Meta Rivers, have forgotten all about the hopes and fears that, in brighter days,
      had centred on that small personage; until one day, as she came home from Cocksmoor, she found
      "Sir Henry Walkinghame's" card on the drawingroom table. 'I should like to bite you! Coming
      here, are you?' was her amiable reflection!</p>
     <p>Meta, in her riding-habit, peeped out of Margaret's room. 'O Ethel, there you are! It is
      such a boon that you did not come home sooner, or we should have had to ride home with him! I
      heard him asking for the Miss Mays! And now I am in hopes that he will go home without falling
      in with Flora and George.'</p>
     <p>'I did not know he was in these parts.'</p>
     <p>'He came to Drydale last week, but the place is forlorn, and George gave him a general
      invitation to the Grange.'</p>
     <p>'Do <hi>you</hi> like him?' said Ethel, while Margaret looked on, amazed at her
      audacity.</p>
     <p>'I liked him very much in London,' said Meta; 'he is pleasant enough to talk to, but
      somehow, he is not congruous here—if you understand me. And I think his coming oppresses
      Flora—she turned quite pale when he was announced, and her voice was lower than ever when she
      spoke to him.'</p>
     <p>'Does he come often?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I don't think he has anything else to do,' returned Meta, 'for our house cannot be as
      pleasant as it was; but he is very kind to George, and for that we must be grateful. One thing
      I am afraid of, that he will persuade us off to the yachtting after all.'</p>
     <p>'Oh!' was the general exclamation.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Meta. 'George seemed to like the plan, and I very
      <pb n="582"/> much fear that he is taking a dislike to the dear old Grange. I heard him say,
      "anything to get away."'</p>
     <p>'Poor George, I know he is restless,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'At least,' said Ethel, 'you can't go till after your birthday, Miss Heiress.'</p>
     <p>'No, uncle Cosham is coming,' said Meta. 'Margaret, you must have your stone laid before we
      go!'</p>
     <p>'Dr. Spencer promises it before Hector's holidays are over,' said Margaret, blushing, as she
      always did, with pleasure, when they talked of the Church.</p>
     <p>Hector Ernescliffe had revived Margaret wonderfully. She was seldom down-stairs before the
      evening, and Ethel thought his habit of making her apartment his sitting-room, must be as
      inconvenient to her, as it was to herself; but Hector could not be <hi>de trop</hi> for
      Margaret. She exerted herself to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that, with her
      brothers, had been transferred to Ethel and Mary; she threw herself into all his schemes,
      tried to make him endure Captain Gordon, and she even read his favourite book of Wild Sports,
      though her feelings were constantly lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals. Her
      couch was to him as a home, and he had awakened her bright soft liveliness which had been only
      dimmed for a time.</p>
     <p>The Church was her other great interest, and Dr. Spencer humoured her by shewing her all his
      drawings, consulting her on every ornament, and making many a perspective elevation, merely
      that she might see the effect.</p>
     <p>Richard and Tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the Church as a present for
      her, and Tom developed a genius for carving, which proved a beneficial interest to keep him
      from surliness. He had voluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father, who had
      been so much pleased by his choice, that he could not but be gratified; though now and then
      ambitious fancies, and discontent with Stoneborough, combined to bring on his ordinary moody
      fits, the more, because his habitual reserve prevented anyone from knowing what was working in
      his mind.</p>
     <p>Finally, the Rivers' party announced their intention of going to the Isle of Wight as soon
      as Meta had come of age; and the council of Cocksmoor, meeting at tea at Dr. May's house,
      decided that the Foundation Stone of the Church should be laid on the day after her birthday,
      when there would be a gathering of the whole family, as Margaret wished. Dr. Spencer had
      worked incredibly hard to bring it forward, and Margaret's sweet smiles, and liquid eyes,
      expressed how personally thankful she felt.</p>
     <p>'What a blessing this Church has been to that poor girl,' said
      <pb n="583"/> Dr. Spencer, as he left the house with Mr. Wilmot. 'How it beguiles her out of
      her grief! I am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation; I doubt if she will see the
      Consecration.'</p>
     <p>'Indeed!' said Mr. Wilmot, shocked. 'Was that attack so serious?'</p>
     <p>'That recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce organic disease, and
      suspense and sorrow have hastened it. The death of Mrs. Rivers' poor child was the blow that
      called it into activity, and, if it last more than a year, I shall be surprised.'</p>
     <p>'For such as she is, one cannot presume to wish, but her father —Is he aware of this?'</p>
     <p>'He knows there is extensive damage; I think he does not open his eyes to the result, but he
      will bear it. Never was there a man to whom it came so naturally to live like the the fowls of
      the air, or the lilies of the field, as it does to dear Dick May,' said Dr. Spencer, his voice
      faltering.</p>
     <p>'There is a strength of faith and love in him, that carries him through all,' said Mr.
      Wilmot. 'His childlike nature seems to have the trustfulness that is, in itself, consolation.
      You said how Cocksmoor had been blessed to Margaret—I think it is the same with them all—not
      only Ethel and Richard, who have been immediately concerned; but that one object has been a
      centre and aim to elevate the whole family, and give force and unity to their efforts. Even
      the good Doctor, much as I always looked up to him—much good as he did me in my young days—I
      must confess that he was sometimes very provoking.'</p>
     <p>'If you had tried to be his keeper at Cambridge, you might say so!' rejoined Dr.
      Spencer.</p>
     <p>'He is so much less impetuous—more consistent—less desultory; I dare say you understand me,'
      said Mr. Wilmot. 'His good qualities do not entangle one another as they used to do.'</p>
     <p>'Exactly so. He was far more than I looked for when I came home, though I might have guessed
      that such a disposition, backed by such principles and such—could not but shake off all the
      dross.'</p>
     <p>'One thing was,' said Mr. Wilmot, smiling, 'that a man must take himself in hand, at some
      time in his life, and Dr. May only began to think himself responsible for himself, when he
      lost his wife, who was wise for both. She was an admirable person, but not easy to know well.
      I think you knew her at—'</p>
     <p>'I say,' interrupted Dr. Spencer, 'it strikes me that we could not do better than get up our
      S. P. G. demonstration on the day of the stone—'</p>
     <p>Hitherto the Stoneborough subscribers to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had
      been few and far between; but, under
      <pb n="584"/> the new dynasty, there was a talk of forming an association, and having a
      meeting to bring the subject forward. Dr. Spencer's proposal, however, took the Vicar by
      surprise.</p>
     <p>'Never could there be a better time,' he argued. You have naturally a gathering of
      Clergy—people ought to be liberal on such an occasion, and, as Cocksmoor is provided for, why
      not give the benefit to the missions, in their crying need.'</p>
     <p>'True, but there is no time to send for anyone to make a speech.'</p>
     <p>'Husband your resources. What could you have better than young Harry and his islanders?'</p>
     <p>'Harry would never make a speech.'</p>
     <p>'Let him cram Norman. Young Lake tells me Norman made a great sensation at the Union at
      Oxford, and if his heart is in the work, he must not shrink from the face of his
      townsmen.'</p>
     <p>'No doubt, he had rather they were savages,' said the Vicar. 'And yourself—you will tell
      them of the Indian Missions.'</p>
     <p>'With all my heart,' said Dr. Spencer. 'When my Brahminhee Godson—the Deacon I told you of,
      comes to pay me his promised visit, what doings we shall have! Seriously, I have just had
      letters from him and from others, that speak of such need, that I could feel every moment
      wasted that is not spent on their behalf.'</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot was drawn into Dr. Spencer's house, and heard the letters, till his heart burnt
      within him.</p>
     <p>The meeting was at once decided upon, though Ethel could not see why people could not give
      without speechifying, and her two younger brothers declared it was humbug—Tom saying, he
      wished all blackamoors were out of creation, and Harry, that he could not stand palaver about
      his friend David. Dr. May threatened him with being displayed on the platform as a living
      instance of the effects of Missions, at which he took alarm, and so seriously declared that he
      should join the Bucephalus at once, that they pacified him by promising that he should do as
      he pleased.</p>
     <p>The Archdeacon promised a Sermon, and the active Dr. Spencer worked the Nine Muses and all
      the rest of the town and neighbourhood into a state of great enthusiasm and expectation. He
      went to the Grange, as he said, to collect his artillery; primed Flora that she might prime
      the M. P.; made the willing Meta promise to entrap the uncle, who was noted for
      philanthropical speeches; and himself captured Sir Henry Walkinghame, who looked somewhat
      rueful at what he found incumbent on him as a country gentleman, though there might be some
      compensation in the eagerness of Miss Rivers.</p>
     <p>Norman had hardly set foot in Stoneborough before he was told what was in store for him,
      and, to the general surprise, submitted as if it were a very simple matter. As Dr. Spencer
      told him, it was
      <pb n="585"/> only a foretaste of the penalty which every Missionary has to pay for coming to
      England. Norman was altogether looking much better than when he had been last at home, and his
      spirits were more even. He had turned his whole soul to the career he had chosen, cast his
      disappointment behind him, or, more truly, made it his offering, and gathered strength and
      calmness, with which to set out on tasks of working for others, with thoughts too much
      absorbed on them, to give way to the propensity of making himself the primary object of study
      and contemplation. The praise of God, and love of man, were the best cures for tendencies like
      his, and he had found it out. His calm, though grave cheerfulness, came as a refreshment to
      those who had been uneasy about him, and mournfully watching poor Flora.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Dr. Spencer, 'you have taken the best course for your own happiness.</p>
     <p>Norman coloured, as if he understood more than met the ear.</p>
     <p>Mary and Blanche were very busy preparing presents for Meta Rivers, and everyone was anxious
      to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without her father. Each of the family
      contributed some pretty little trifle, choice in workmanship or kind in device, and each was
      sealed and marked with the initials of the giver, and packed up by Mary, to be committed to
      Flora's charge. Blanche had, however, much tronble in extracting a gift from Norman, and he
      only yielded at last, on finding that all his brothers had sent something, so that his
      omission would be marked. Then he dived into the recesses of his desk, and himself sealed up a
      little parcel, of which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents.</p>
     <p>Ethel had a shrewd guess. She remembered his having, in the flush of joy at Margaret's
      engagement, rather prematurely caused a seal to be cut with a Daisy, and "Pearl of the meadow"
      as the motto; and his having said that he should keep it as a wedding present. She could
      understand that he was willing to part with it without remark.</p>
     <p>Flora met Meta in her sitting room, on the morning of the day, which rose somewhat sadly
      upon the young girl, as she thought of past affection and new responsibilities. If the
      fondness of a sister could have compensated for what she had lost, Meta received it in no
      scanty measure from Flora, who begged to call George, because he would be pleased to see the
      display of gifts.</p>
     <p>His own was the only costly one—almost all the rest were homemade treasures of the greater
      price, because the skill and fondness of the maker were evident in their construction; and
      Meta took home the kindness as it was meant, and felt the affection that would not let her
      feel herself lonely. She only wished to go and thank them all at once.</p>
     <pb n="586"/>
     <p>'Do then,' said Flora. 'If Lord Cosham will spare you, and your business should be over in
      time, you could drive in, and try to bring papa home with you.'</p>
     <p>'O thank you, Flora. That is a kind treat, in case the morning should be very awful!'</p>
     <p>Margaret Agatha Rivers signed her documents, listened to explanations, and was complimented
      by her uncle on not thinking it necessary to be senseless on money matters, like her cousin,
      Agatha Langdale.</p>
     <p>Still she looked a little oppressed, as she locked up the tokens of her wealth, and the
      sunshine of her face did not beam out again till she arrived at Stoneborough, and was
      dispensing her pretty thanks to the few she found at home.</p>
     <p>'Ethel out and Norman? His seal is only too pretty—'</p>
     <p>'They are all helping Dr. Spencer at Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>'What a pity! But it is so very kind of him to treat me as a Daisy. In some ways I like his
      present for that the best of all,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'I will tell him so,' said Mary.</p>
     <p>'Yes—no'—said Meta. 'I am not pretending to be anything half so nice.</p>
     <p>Mary and Blanche fell upon her for calling herself anything but the nicest flower in the
      world; and she contended that she was nothing better than a parrot-tulip, stuck up in a
      parterre; and just as the discussion was becoming a game at romps, Dr. May came in, and the
      children shouted to him to say whether his humming-bird were a Daisy or a Tulip.</p>
     <p>'That is as she comports herself,' he said, playfully.</p>
     <p>'Which means that you don't think her quite done for,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'Not quite,' said the Doctor, with a droll intonation; 'but I have not seen what this
      morning may have done to her.'</p>
     <p>'Come and see, then,' said Meta. 'Flora told me to bring you home—and it is my birthday, you
      know. Never mind waiting to tell Ethel. Margaret will let her know that I'll keep you out of
      mischief.'</p>
     <p>As usual, Dr. May could not withstand her—and she carried him off in triumph in her pony
      carriage.</p>
     <p>'Then you don't give me up yet?' was the first thing she said, as they were off the
      stones.</p>
     <p>'What have you been doing to make me?' said he.</p>
     <p>'Doing or not doing—one or the other,' she said. 'But indeed I wanted to have you to myself.
      I am in a great puzzle!'</p>
     <p>'Sir Henry! I hope she won't consult me!' thought Dr. May, as he answered, 'Well, my
      dear.'</p>
     <pb n="587"/>
     <p>'I fear it is a lasting puzzle,' she said. 'What shall I do with all this money?'</p>
     <p>'Keep it in the Bank, or buy railway shares?' said Dr. may, looking arch.</p>
     <p>'Thank you. That's question for my cousins in the City. I want you to answer me as no one
      else can do. I want to know what is my duty now that I have that I have my means in my own
      hands?'</p>
     <p>'There is need enough around—'</p>
     <p>'I do not mean only giving a little here and there, but I want you to hear a few of my
      thoughts. Flora and George are kindness itself—but, you see, I have no duties. They are
      obliged to live a gay sort of life—it is their position; but I cannot make out whether it is
      mine. I don't see that I am like those girls who have to go out as a matter of obedience.'</p>
     <p>Dr. May considered, but could only say, 'You are very young.'</p>
     <p>'Too young to be independent,' sighed Meta. 'I must grow old enough to be trusted alone, and
      in the mean time—'</p>
     <p>'Probably an answer will be found,' said the Doctor. You and your means will find
      their—thier vocation.'</p>
     <p>'Marriage,' said Meta, calmly speaking the word that he had avoided. 'I think not.'</p>
     <p>'Why?'—he began.</p>
     <p>'I do not think good men like heiresses.'</p>
     <p>He became strongly interested in a corn-field, and she resumed, 'Perhaps I should only do
      harm. It may be my duty to wait. All I wish to know is, whether it is?'</p>
     <p>'I see you are not like girls who know their duty, and are restless, because it is not the
      duty they like.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! I like everything. It is my liking it so much that makes me afraid.</p>
     <p>'Even going to Ryde?'</p>
     <p>'Don't I like the sailing? and seeing Harry too? I don't feel as if that were waste, because
      I can sometimes spare poor Flora a little. We could not let her go alone.'</p>
     <p>'You need never fear to be without a mission of comfort,' said Dr. May. Your 'spirit full of
      glee' was given you for something. Your presence is far more to my poor Flora than you or she
      guess.'</p>
     <p>'I never meant to leave her now,' said Meta, earnestly. 'I only wished to be clear whether I
      ought to seek for my work.'</p>
     <p>'It will seek you, when the time comes.'</p>
     <p>'And meantime I must do what comes to hand, and take it as humiliation that it is not in the
      more obviously blessed tasks! A call might come, as Cocksmoor did to Ethel. But, oh! my money!
      Ought it to be laid up for myself?'</p>
     <pb n="588"/>
     <p>'For your call, when it comes,' said Dr. May, smiling—then gravely, 'There are but too many
      calls for the interest. The principal is your trust, till the time comes.'</p>
     <p>Meta smiled, and was pleased to think that her first-fruits would be offered to-morrow.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
     <p>'O dear !' sighed Etheldred, as she fastened her white muslin, 'I'm afraid it is
      my nature to hate my neighbour!'</p>
     <p>'My dear Ethel, what is coming next?' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'I like my neighbour at home, and whom I have to work for, very much,' said Ethel, 'but oh!
      my neighbour that I have to be civil to!'</p>
     <p>'Poor old King! I am afraid your day will be spoilt with all your toils as lady of the
      house. I wish I could help you.'</p>
     <p>'Let me have my grumble out, and you will!' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Indeed I am sorry you have this bustle, and so many to entertain, when I know you would
      rather have the peaceful feelings belonging to the day undisturbed. I should like to shelter
      you up here.'</p>
     <p>'It is very ungrateful of me,' said Ethel, 'when Dr. Spencer works so hard for us, not to be
      willing to grant anything to him.'</p>
     <p>'And—but then I have none of the trouble of it—I can't help liking the notion of sending out
      the Church to the island whence the Church came home to us.'</p>
     <p>'Yes—' said Ethel, 'if we could do it without holding forth!'</p>
     <p>'Come, Ethel, it is much better than the bazaar—it is no field for vanity.'</p>
     <p>'Certainly not,' said Ethel. 'What a mess everyone will make! O if I could but stay away,
      like Harry! There will be Dr. Hoxton being sonorous and prosy, and Mr. Lake will stammer, and
      that will be nothing to the misery of our own people's work. George will flounder, and look at
      Flora, and she will sit with her eyes on the ground, and Dr. Spencer will come out of his
      proper self, and be complimentary to people who deserve it no more!—And Norman— I wish I could
      run away!'</p>
     <pb n="589"/>
     <p>'Richard says we do not guess how well Norman speaks.'</p>
     <p>'Richard thinks Norman can do anything he can't do himself! It is all chance—he may do very
      well, if he gets into his " <hi>funny state</hi> ," but he always suffers for that, and he
      will certainly put one into an agony at the outset. I wish Dr. Spencer would have let him
      alone! And then there will be that Sir Henry, whom I can't abide! Oh! I wish I were more
      charitable, like Miss Bracy and Mary, who will think all so beautiful.'</p>
     <p>'So will you, when you come home,' said Margaret.</p>
     <p>'If I could only be talking to Cherry, and Dame Hall! I think the school children enter into
      it very nicely, Margaret. Did I tell you how nicely Ellen Reid answered about the Hymn, "From
      Greenland's icy mountains." She did not seem to have made it a mere geographical lesson, like
      Fanny Grigg—'</p>
     <p>Ethel's misanthropy was happily conducted off <hi>via</hi> the Cocksmoor children, and any
      lingering remains were dissipated by her amusement at Dr. Spencer's ecstacy on seeing Dr. May
      assume his red robe of office, to go to the Minster in state, with the Town Council. He walked
      round and round his friend, called him Nicholas Randall <hi>redivivus</hi> , quoted Dogberry,
      and affronted Gertrude, who had a dim idea that he was making game of papa!</p>
     <p>Ethel was one of those to whom representation was such a penance, that a festival,
      necessitating hospitality to guests of her own rank, was burthen enough seriously to disturb
      the repose of thankfulness for the attainment of her object, and to render difficult the
       <hi>recueillement</hi> which she needed for the praise and prayer that she felt due from her,
      and which seemed to oppress her heart, by a sense of the inadequacy of her partial expression.
      It was well for her that the day began with the calm service in the Minster, where it was her
      own fault if cares haunted her, and she could confess the sin of her irritated sensations, and
      wishes to have all her own way, and then, as ever, be led aright into thanksgiving for the
      unlooked for crowning of her labours.</p>
     <p>The Archdeacon's sermon amplified what Margaret had that morning expressed, so as to carry
      on her sense of appropriateness in the offerings of the day being bestowed on distant
      lands.</p>
     <p>But the ordeal was yet to come, and though blaming herself, she was anything but
      comfortable, as the world repaired to the Town-hall, the room where the same faces so often
      met for such diverse purposes —now an orrery displayed by a conceited lecturer, now a ball,
      now a magistrates' meeting, a concert or a poultry shew, where rival Hamburg and Dorking
      uplifted their voices in the places of Mario and Grisi, all beneath the benignant portrait of
      Nicholas Randall,
      <pb n="590"/> ruffed, robed, square-toed, his endowment of the scholarship in his hand, and a
      chequered pavement at his feet.</p>
     <p>Who knows not an S. P. G. meeting? the gaiety of the serious, and the first public spectacle
      to the young, who, like Blanche and Aubrey, gaze with admiration at the rows of bonnets, and
      with awe at the black coats on the platform, while the relations of the said black coats
      suffer, like Ethel, from nervous dread of the public speaking of their best friends.</p>
     <p>Her expectations were realized by the Archdeacon's speech, which went round in a circle, as
      if he could not find his way out of it. Lord Cosham was fluent, but a great many words went to
      very small substance; and no wonder, thought Ethel, when all they had to propose and second
      was the obvious fact that Missions were very good things.</p>
     <p>Dr. Hoxton pompously, Sir Henry Walkinghame creditably, assisted the ladies and gentlemen to
      resolve that the S. P. G. wanted help; Mr. Lake made a stammering, and Mr. Rivers, with his
      good-natured face, hearty manner, and good voice, came in well after him, with a
      straightforward speech, so brief, that Ethel gave Flora credit for the best she had yet
      heard.</p>
     <p>Mr. Wilmot said something which the sharpest ears in the front row might, perhaps, have
      heard, and which resulted in Dr. Spencer standing up. Ethel hardly would have known who was
      speaking had her eyes been shut. His voice was so different, when raised and pitched, so as to
      shew its power and sweetness; the fine polish of his manner was redoubled, and every sentence
      had the most graceful turn. It was like listening to a well-written book, so smooth and so
      fluent, and yet so earnest—his pictures of Indian life so beautiful, and his strong affection
      for the converts he described now and then making his eyes fill, and his voice falter, as if
      losing the thread of his studied composition—a true and dignified work of art, that made Dr.
      May whisper to Flora, "You see what he can do. They would have given anything to have had him
      for a lecturer."</p>
     <p>With half a sigh, Ethel saw Norman rise, and step forward. He began with eyes fixed on the
      ground, and, in a low modest tone, to speak of the islands that Harry had visited; but
      gradually the poetic nature, inherent in him, gained the mastery; and though his language was
      strikingly simple, in contrast with Dr. Spencer's ornate periods, and free from all trace of
      "the lamp," it rose in beauty and fervour at every sentence. The feelings that had decided his
      lot gave energy to his discourse, and repressed as they had been by reserve and diffidence,
      now flowed forth, and gave earnestness to natural gifts of eloquence of the highest order.
      After his quiet,
      <pb n="591"/> unobtrusive beginning, there was the more wonder to find how he seemed to raise
      up the audience with him, in breathless attention, as to a strain of sweet music, carrying
      them without thought of the scene, or of the speaker, to the lovely isles, and the inhabitants
      of noble promise, but withering for lack of knowledge; and finally closing his speech, when
      they were wrought up to the highest pitch, by an appeal that touched them all home; 'for well
      did he know,' said he, 'that the universal brotherhood was drawn closest in circles nearer
      home, that beneath the shadow of their own old Minster, gladness and mourning floated alike
      for all; and that all those who had shared in the welcome to one, given back as it were from
      the grave, would own the same debt of gratitude to the hospitable islanders.'</p>
     <p>He ceased. His father wiped his spectacles, and almost audibly murmured, "Bless him!" Ethel,
      who had sat like one enchanted, forgetting who spoke, forgetting all save the islanders,
      half-turned, and met Richard's smiling eyes, and his whisper—"I told you so."</p>
     <p>The impress of a man of true genius and power had been made throughout the whole assembly;
      the Archdeacon put Norman out of countenance by the thanks of the meeting, for his admirable
      speech, and all the world, except the Oxford men, were in a state of as much surprise as
      pleasure.</p>
     <p>'Splendid speaker, Norman May, if he would oftener put himself out,' Harvey Anderson
      commented. 'Pity he has so many of the good Doctor's prejudices!'</p>
     <p>'Well, to be sure!' quoth Mrs. Ledwich. 'I knew Mr. Norman was very clever, but I declare I
      never thought of such as this! I will try my poor utmost for those interesting natives.'</p>
     <p>'That youth has first-rate talents,' said Lord Cosham. 'Do you know what he is designed for?
      I should like to bring him forward.'</p>
     <p>'Ah!' said Dr. Hoxton. 'The year I sent off May and Anderson was the proudest year of my
      life!'</p>
     <p>'Upon my word!' declared Mrs. Elwood. 'That Dr. Spencer is as good as a book, but Mr. Norman
      — I say, father we will go without the new clock, but we'll send somewhat to they men that
      built up the Church, and has no Minister.'</p>
     <p>'A good move that,' said Dr. Spencer. 'Worth at least £20. That boy has the temperament of
      an orator, if the morbid were but a grain less.'</p>
     <p>'O Margaret,' exclaimed Blanche. 'Dr. Spencer made the finest speech you ever heard, only it
      was rather tiresome; and Norman made everybody cry—and Mary worse than all!'</p>
     <p>'There is no speaking of it. One should live such things, not talk over them,' said Meta
      Rivers.</p>
     <pb n="592"/>
     <p>Margaret received the reports of the select few, who visited her up-stairs, where she was
      kept quiet, and only heard the hum of the swarm, whom Dr. May, in vehement hospitality, had
      brought home to luncheon, to Ethel's great dread, lest there should not be enough for them to
      eat.</p>
     <p>Margaret pitied her sisters, but heard that all was going well; that Flora was taking care
      of the elders, and Harry and Mary were making the younger fry very merry at the table on the
      lawn. Dr. May had to start early to see a sick gardener at Drydale before coming on to
      Cocksmoor, and came up to give his daughter a few minutes.</p>
     <p>'We get on famously,' he said. 'Ethel does well when she is in for it, like Norman. I had no
      notion what was in the lad. They are perfectly amazed with his speech. It seems hard to give
      such as he is up to those outlandish places—but there, his speech should have taught me
      better—one's best—and, now and then, he seems my best.'</p>
     <p>'One comfort is,' said Margaret, smiling, 'you would miss Ethel more.'</p>
     <p>'Gallant old King! I am glad she has had her wish—Good-bye, my Margaret, we will think of
      you—I wish—'</p>
     <p>'I am very happy,' was Margaret's gentle re-assurance. 'The dear little Daisy looks just as
      her godfather imagined her—' and happy was her face when her father quitted her.</p>
     <p>Margaret's next visitor was Meta, who came to reclaim her bonnet, and, with a merry smile,
      to leave word that she was walking on to Cocksmoor. Margaret remonstrated on the heat.</p>
     <p>'Let me alone,' said she, making her pretty wilful gesture. 'Ethel and Mary ought to have a
      lift, and I have had no walking to-day.'</p>
     <p>'My dear, you don't know how far it is. You can't go alone.'</p>
     <p>'I am lying in wait for Miss Bracy, or something innocent,' said Meta. 'In good time—here
      comes Tom.'</p>
     <p>Tom entered, declaring that he had come to escape from the clack down-stairs.</p>
     <p>'I'll promise not to clack, if you will be so kind as to take care of me to Cocksmoor,' said
      Meta.</p>
     <p>'Do you intend to walk?'</p>
     <p>'If you will let me be your companion.'</p>
     <p>'I shall be most happy,' said Tom, colouring with gratification, such as he might not have
      felt, had he known that he was chosen for his innocence.</p>
     <p>He took a passing glimpse at his neck-tie, screwed up the nap of his glossy hat to the
      perfection of its central point, armed himself
      <pb n="593"/> with a knowing little stick, and hurried his fair companion out by the
      back-door, as much afraid of losing the glory of being her sole protector as she was of
      falling in with an escort of as much consequence, in other eyes, as was Mr. Thomas in his
      own.</p>
     <p>She knew him less than any of the rest, and her first amusement was, keeping silence to
      punish him for complaining of clack; but he explained that he did not mean quiet, sensible
      conversation—he only referred to those foolish women's raptures over the gabble they had been
      hearing at the Town Hall.</p>
     <p>She exclaimed, whereupon he began to criticise the speakers with a good deal of acuteness,
      exposing the weak points, but magnanimously owning that it was tolerable for the style of
      thing, and might go down at Stoneborough.</p>
     <p>'I wonder you did not stay away as Harry did.'</p>
     <p>'I thought it would be marked,' observed the thread-paper Tom, as if he had been at least
      County member.</p>
     <p>'You did quite right,' said Meta, really thinking so.</p>
     <p>'I wished to hear Dr. Spencer, too,' said Tom. 'There is a man who does know how to speak!
      He has seen something of the world, and knows what he is talking of.'</p>
     <p>'But he did not come near Norman.'</p>
     <p>'I hated listening to Norman,' said Tom. 'Why should he go and set his heart on those black
      savages?'</p>
     <p>'They are not savages in New Zealand.'</p>
     <p>'They are all niggers together,' said Tom, vehemently. 'I cannot think why Norman should
      care for them more than for his own brothers and sisters. All I know is, that if I were my
      father, I would never give my consent.'</p>
     <p>'It is lucky you are not,' said Meta, smiling defiance, though a tear shone in her eye. 'Dr.
      May makes the sacrifice with a free heart and willing mind.'</p>
     <p>'Everybody goes and sacrifices somebody else,' grumbled Tom.</p>
     <p>'Who are the victims now?'</p>
     <p>'All of us. What are we to do without Norman? He is worth all of us put together; and I—'
      Meta was drawn to the boy as she had never been before, as he broke off short, his face full
      of emotion, that made him remind her of his father.</p>
     <p>'You might go out and follow in his steps,' said she, as the most consoling hope she could
      suggest.</p>
     <p>'Not I. Don't you know what is to happen to me? Ah! Flora has not told you. I thought she
      would not think it grand enough. She talked about diplomacy—'</p>
     <p>'But what?' asked Meta, anxiously.</p>
     <pb n="594"/>
     <p>'Only that I am to stick to the old shop,' said Tom. 'Don't tell anyone; I would not have
      the fellows know it.'</p>
     <p>'Do you mean your father's profession?'</p>
     <p>'Aye!'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Tom, you don't talk of that as if you despised it?'</p>
     <p>'If it is good enough for him, it is good enough for me, I suppose,' said Tom. 'I hate
      everything, when I think of my brothers' going over the world, while I, do what I will, I must
      be tied down to this slow place all the rest of my days.'</p>
     <p>'If you were away, you would be longing after it.'</p>
     <p>'Yes; but I can't get away.'</p>
     <p>'Surely, if the notion is so unpleasant to you, Dr. May would never insist?'</p>
     <p>'It is my free choice, and that's the worst of it.'</p>
     <p>'I don't understand.'</p>
     <p>'Don't you see? Norman told me it would be a great relief to him, if I would turn my mind
      that way—and I can't go against Norman. I found he thought he must, if I did not; and, you
      know, he is fit for all sorts of things that— Besides, he has a squeamishness about him, that
      makes him turn white, if one does but cut one's finger, and how he would ever go through the
      hospitals—'</p>
     <p>Meta suspected that Tom was inclined to launch into horrors. 'So you wanted to spare him,'
      she said.</p>
     <p>'Aye! and papa was so pleased by my offering, that I can't say a word of the bore it is. If
      I were to back out, it would come upon Aubrey, and he is weakly, and so young, that he could
      not help my father for many years.'</p>
     <p>Meta was much struck at the motives that actuated the self-sacrifice, veiled by the sullen
      manner which she almost began to respect. 'What is done for such reasons must make you happy,'
      she said; 'though there may be much that is disagreeable.'</p>
     <p>'Not the study,' said Tom. 'The science is famous work. I like what I see of it in my
      father's books, and there's a splendid skeleton at the hospital, that I long to be at. If it
      were not for Stoneborough, it would be all very well; but, if I should get on ever so well at
      the examinations, it all ends here! I must come back, and go racing about this miserable
      circuit, just like your gold pheasant rampaging in his cage, seeing the same stupid people all
      my days.'</p>
     <p>'I think,' said Meta, in a low, heartfelt voice, 'it is a noble, beautiful thing to curb
      down your ambition for such causes. Tom, I like you for it.'</p>
     <p>The glance of those beautiful eyes was worth having. Tom coloured a little, but assumed his
      usual gruffness.</p>
     <pb n="595"/>
     <p>'I can't bear sick people,' he said.</p>
     <p>'It has always seemed to me,' said Meta, 'that few lives could come up to Dr. May's. Think
      of going about, always watched for with hope, often bringing gladness and relief; if nothing
      else, comfort and kindness, his whole business doing good.'</p>
     <p>'One is paid for it,' said Tom.</p>
     <p>'Nothing could ever repay Dr. May,' said Meta. 'Can anyone feel the fee anything but a mere
      form? Besides, think of the numbers and numbers that he takes nothing from; and, oh! to how
      many he has brought the most real good, when they would have shut their doors against it in
      any other form? Oh! Tom, I think none of you guess how everyone feels about your father. I
      recollect one poor woman saying, after he had attended her brother, "He could not save his
      body, but, surely, ma'am, I think he was the saving of his soul."'</p>
     <p>'It is of no use to talk of my being like my father,' said Tom.</p>
     <p>Meta thought perhaps not, but she was full of admiration of his generosity, and said, 'Your
      will make it the same work of love, and charity is the true glory.'</p>
     <p>Any inroad on Tom's reserved and depressed nature was a benefit; and he was of an age to be
      susceptible of the sympathy of one so pretty and so engaging. He had never been so much
      gratified or encouraged, and, wishing to prolong the <hi>tête à tête</hi> , he choose to take
      the short cut through the fir-planations, unfrequented on account of the perpendicular, spiked
      railings that divided it from the lane.</p>
     <p>Meta was humming-bird enough to be undismayed. She put hand and foot wherever he desired,
      flattered him by letting him handily help her up, and bounded light as a feather down on the
      other side, congratulating herself on the change from the dusty lane to the whispering pine
      woods, between which wound the dark path, bestrewn with brown slippery needle-leaves, and
      edged with the delicate feathering ling and tufts of soft grass.</p>
     <p>Tom had miscalculated the chances of interruption. Meta was lingering to track the royal
      high-way of some giant ants to their fir-leaf hillock, when they were hailed from behind, and
      her squire-felt ferocious at the sight of Norman and Harry closing the perspective of
      fir-trunks.</p>
     <p>'Hollo! Tom, what a guide you are!' exclaimed Norman. 'That fence which even Ethel and Mary
      avoid!'</p>
     <p>'Mary climbs like a cow, and Ethel like a father-long-legs,' said Tom. 'Now, Meta flies like
      a bird.'</p>
     <p>'And Tom helped me so cleverly,' said Meta. 'It was an excellent move, to get into the shade
      and this delicious pine-tree fragrance.'</p>
     <p>'Halt!' said Norman—'this is too fast for Meta.'</p>
     <pb n="596"/>
     <p>'I cannot,' said Harry. 'I must get there in time to set Dr. Spencer's tackle to rights. He
      is tolerably knowing about knots, but there is a dodge beyond him. Come on, Tom.'</p>
     <p>He drew on the reluctant Etonian, who looked repiningly back at the increasing distance
      between him and the other pair, till a turn in the path cut off his view.</p>
     <p>'I am afraid you do not know what you have undertaken,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'I am a capital walker. And I know, or do not know, how often Ethel takes the same
      walk.'</p>
     <p>'Ethel is no rule.'</p>
     <p>'She ought to be,' said Meta. 'To be like her has always been my ambition.'</p>
     <p>'Circumstances have formed Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'Circumstances! What an ambiguous word! Either Providence pointing to duty, or the world
      drawing us from it.'</p>
     <p>'Stepping-stones, or stumbling-blocks.'</p>
     <p>'And oh! the difficult question, when to bend them, or to bend to them!'</p>
     <p>'There must be always some guiding,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'I believe there is,' said Meta, 'but when trumpet-peals are ringing around, it is hard to
      know whether one is really "waiting beside the tent," or only dawdling.'</p>
     <p>'It is great selfdenial in the immoveable square not to join the charge,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Yes, but they, being shot at, are not deceiving themselves.'</p>
     <p>'I suppose self-deception on those points is very common.'</p>
     <p>'Especially among young ladies,' said Meta. 'I hear so much of what girls would do, if they
      might, or could, that I long to see them like Ethel—do what they can. And then it strikes me
      that I am doing the same, living wilfully in indulgence, and putting my trust in my own
      misgivings and discontent.'</p>
     <p>'I should have thought that discontent had as little to do with you, as with any living
      creature.'</p>
     <p>'You don't know how I could growl!' said Meta, laughing. 'Though less from having anything
      to complain of, than from having nothing to complain of.'</p>
     <p>'You mean,' he said, pausing, with a seriousness and hesitation that startled her. 'Do you
      mean that this is not the course of life that you would choose?'</p>
     <p>A sort of bashfulness made her put her answer playfully, '"All play and no work makes Jack a
      mere toy."' </p>
     <p>'Toys have a kindly mission, and I may be good for nothing
      <pb n="597"/> else; but I would have rather been a coffee-pot than a China shepherdess.'</p>
     <p>The gaiety disconcerted him, and he seemed to try to be silent, or to reply in the same
      tone, but he could not help returning to the subject. 'Then you find no charm in the
      refinements to which you have been brought up?'</p>
     <p>'Only too much,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>He was silent, and fearing to have added to his fine lady impression, she resumed. 'I mean
      that I never <hi>could</hi> dislike anything, and kindness gives these things a soul; but, of
      course, I should be better satisfied, if I lived harder, and had work to do.'</p>
     <p>'Meta!' he exclaimed, 'you tempt me very much! Would you? —No, it is too unreasonable. Would
      you share—share the work that I have undertaken?'</p>
     <p>He turned aside and leant against a tree, as if not daring to watch the effect of the
      agitated words that had broken from him. She had little imagined whither his last sayings had
      been tending, and stood still, breathless with the surprise.</p>
     <p>'Forgive me,' he said, hastily. 'It was very wrong. I never meant to have vexed you, by the
      betrayal of my vain affection.'</p>
     <p>He seemed to be going, and this roused her. 'Stay, Norman,' exclaimed she. 'Why should it
      vex me? I should like it very much, indeed.'</p>
     <p>He faced suddenly towards her; 'Meta, Meta! is it possible? Do you know what you are
      saying?'</p>
     <p>'I think I do.'</p>
     <p>'You must understand me,' said Norman, striving to speak calmly. 'You have been—Words will
      not express what you have been to me for years past, but I thought you too far beyond my
      hopes. I knew I ought to be removed from you—I believed that those who are debarred from
      earthly happiness, are marked for especial tasks. I never intended you to know what actuated
      me, and now the work is undertaken, and—and I cannot turn back—' he added, quickly, as if
      fearing himself.</p>
     <p>'No indeed,' was her steady reply.</p>
     <p>'Then I may believe it!' cried Norman. 'You do—you will— you deliberately choose to share it
      with me?'</p>
     <p>'I will try not to be a weight on you,' answered the young girl, with a sweet mixture of
      resolution and humility. 'It would be the greatest possible privilege. I really do not think I
      am a fine lady ingrain, and you will teach me not to be too unworthy.'</p>
     <p>'I? O Meta, you know not what I am. Yet with you, with you to inspire, to strengthen, to
      cheer—Meta, Meta, life is so much changed
      <pb n="598"/> before me, that I cannot understand it yet—after the long dreary
      hopelessness—'</p>
     <p>'I can't think why—' Meta had half said, when feminine dignity checked the words,
      consciousness and confusion suddenly assailed her, dyed her cheeks crimson, and stifled her
      voice.</p>
     <p>It was the same with Norman, and bashfulness making a sudden prey of both—on they went under
      its dominion, in a condition partaking equally of discomfort and felicity; dreading the sound
      of their own voices, afraid of each other's faces, feeling they were treating each other very
      strangely and ungratefully, yet without an idea what to say next, or the power of speaking
      first; and therefore pacing onwards, looking gravely straight along the path, as if to prevent
      the rabbits and fox-gloves from guessing that anything had been passing between them.</p>
     <p>Dr. May had made his call at Drydale, and was driving up a rough lane, between furzey banks,
      leading to Cocksmoor, when he was aware of a tall gentleman on one side of the road and a
      little lady on the other, with the whole space of the cart-track between them, advancing
      soberly towards him.</p>
     <p>'Hollo! Why, Meta! Norman! what brings you here? Where are you going?'</p>
     <p>Norman perceived that he had turned to the left instead of to the right, and was covered
      with shame.</p>
     <p>'That is all your wits are good for. It is well I met you, or you would have led poor Meta a
      pretty dance! You will know better than to trust yourself to the mercies of a scholar another
      time. Let me give you a lift.'</p>
     <p>The courteous Doctor sprang out to hand Meta in, but something made him suddenly desire
      Adams to drive on, and then turning round to the two young people, he said, 'Oh!'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Norman, taking her hand, and drawing her towards him.</p>
     <p>'What, Meta, my pretty one, is it really so? Is he to be happy after all? Are you to be a
      Daisy of my own?'</p>
     <p>'If you will let me,' murmured Meta, clinging to her kind old friend.</p>
     <p>'No flower on earth could come so naturally to us,' said Dr. May. 'And, dear child, at last
      I may venture to tell you that you have a sanction that you will value more than mine. Yes, my
      dear, on the last day of your dear father's life, when some foreboding hung upon him, he spoke
      to me of your prospects, and singled out this very Norman as such as he would prefer.'</p>
     <p>Meta's tears prevented all, save the two little words, 'thank you;'
      <pb n="599"/> but she put out her hand to Norman, as she still rested on the Doctor's arm,
      more as if he had been her mother than Norman's father. 'Did he?' from Norman, was equally
      inexpressive of the almost incredulous gratitude and tenderness of his feeling.</p>
     <p>It would not bear talking over at that moment, and Dr. May presently broke the silence in a
      playful tone. 'So, Meta, good men don't like heiresses?'</p>
     <p>'Quite true,' said Meta, 'it was very much against me.'</p>
     <p>'Or it may be the other way,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Eh? Good men don't like heiresses—here's a man who likes an heiress—therefore here's a man
      that is not good? Ah, ha! Meta, you can see that is false logic, though I've forgotten
      mine.—And pray, Miss, what are we to say to your uncle?'</p>
     <p>'He cannot help it,' said Meta, quickly.</p>
     <p>'Ha!' said the Doctor, laughing, 'we remember our twenty-one years, do we?'</p>
     <p>'I did not mean—I hope I said nothing wrong,' said Meta, in blushing distress. 'Only after
      what you said, I can care for nothing else.'</p>
     <p>'If I could only thank him,' said Norman, fervently.</p>
     <p>'I believe you know how to do that, my boy,' said Dr. May, looking tenderly at the fairy
      figure between them, and ending with a sigh, remembering, perhaps, the sense of protection
      with which he had felt another Margaret lean on his arm.</p>
     <p>The clatter of horses' hoofs caused Meta to withdraw her hand, and Norman to retreat to his
      own side of the lane, as Sir Henry Walkinghame and his servant overtook them.</p>
     <p>'We will be in good time for the proceedings,' called out the Doctor. 'Tell them we are
      coming.'</p>
     <p>'I did not know you were walking,' said Sir Henry, to Meta.</p>
     <p>'It is pleasant in the plantations,' Dr. May answered for her; 'but I am afraid we are late,
      and our punctual friends will be in despair. Will you kindly say we are at hand.'</p>
     <p>Sir Henry rode on, finding that he was not to be allowed to walk his horse with them, and
      that Miss Rivers had never looked up.</p>
     <p>'Poor Sir Henry!' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'He has no right to be surprised,' said Meta, very low.</p>
     <p>'And so you were marching right upon Drydale!' continued Dr. May, not able to help laughing.
      'It was a happy dispensation that I met you.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! I am so glad of it!' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'Though to be sure you were disarming suspicion by so cautiously keeping the road between
      you. I should never have guessed what you had been at.'</p>
     <pb n="600"/>
     <p>There was a little pause, then Meta said rather tremulously, 'Please—I think it should be
      known at once.'</p>
     <p>'Our idle deeds confessed without loss of time, Miss?'</p>
     <p>Norman came across the path, saying, 'Meta is right—it should be known.'</p>
     <p>'I don't think uncle Cosham would object, especially hearing it while he is here,' said
      Meta—'and if he knew what you told us.'</p>
     <p>'He goes to-morrow, does he not?' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>A silence of perplexity ensued. Meta, brave as she was, hardly knew her uncle enough to
      volunteer, and Norman was privately devising, a beginning by the way of George, when Dr. May
      said, 'Well, since it is not a case for putting Ethel in the forefront, I must e'en get it
      over for you, I suppose.'</p>
     <p>'O thank you,' they cried both at once, feeling that he was the proper person in every way,
      and Norman added, 'The sooner the better, if Meta—'</p>
     <p>'O yes, yes, the sooner the better,' exclaimed Meta. 'And let me tell Flora—poor dear
      Flora—she is always so kind.'</p>
     <p>A testimony that was welcome to Dr. May, who had once, at least, been under the impression
      that Flora courted Sir Henry's attentions to her sister-in-law.</p>
     <p>Further consultation was hindered by Tom and Blanche bursting upon them from the common,
      both echoing Norman's former reproach of "A pretty guide!" and while Blanche explained the
      sufferings of all the assembly at their tardiness, Tom, without knowing it, elucidated what
      had been a mystery to the Doctor, namely, how they ever met, by his indignation at Norman's
      having assumed the guidance for which he was so unfit.</p>
     <p>'A shocking leader; Meta will never trust him again,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>Still Blanche thought them not nearly sufficiently sensible of their enormities, and
      preached eagerly about their danger of losing standing room, when they emerged on the moor,
      and beheld a crowd, above whose heads rose the apex of a triangle, formed by three poles,
      sustaining a rope and huge stone.</p>
     <p>'Here comes Dr. Spencer,' she said. 'I hope he <hi>will</hi> scold you.'</p>
     <p>Whatever Dr. Spencer might have suffered, he was far too polite to scold, and a glance
      between the two physicians ended in a merry twinkle of his bright eyes.</p>
     <p>'This way,' he said, 'we are all ready.'</p>
     <p>'But where's my little Daisy?' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'You'll see her in a minute. She is as good as gold.'</p>
     <p>He drew them on up the bank—people making way for them— till he had stationed them among the
      others of their own party,
      <pb n="601"/> beside the deep trench that traced the foundation, around a space that seemed
      far too small.</p>
     <p>Nearly at the same moment, began the soft clear sound of chanting wafted upon the wind, then
      dying away—carried off by some eddying breeze, then clear, and coming nearer and nearer. 'I
      will not suffer mine eyes to sleep,    Nor mine eye-lids to slumber: Neither the temples of my
      head to take any rest; Until I find out a place for the Temple of the Lord: An habitation for
      the mighty God of Jacob.' </p>
     <p>Few, who knew the history of Cocksmoor, could help glancing towards the slight girl, who
      stood, with bent head, her hand clasped over little Aubrey's; while, all that was not prayer
      and thanksgiving in her mind, was applying the words to him, whose head rested in the Pacific
      isle, while, in the place which he had chosen, was laid the foundation of the Temple that he
      had given unto the Lord.</p>
     <p>There came forth the procession: the Minister choristers, Dr. Spencer as architect, and, in
      her white dress, little Gertrude, led between Harry and Hector, Margaret's special choice for
      the occasion, and followed by the Stoneborough Clergy. 'Let thy Priests be clothed with
      righteousness.' </p>
     <p>It came in well with the gentle, meek, stedfast face of the young Curate of Cocksmoor, as he
      moved on in his white robe, and the sun-light shone upon his fair hair, and calm brow,
      thankful for the past, and hoping, more than fearing, for the future.</p>
     <p>The prayers were said, and there was a pause, while Dr. Spencer and the foreman advanced to
      the machine and adjusted it. The two youths then led forward the little girl, her innocent
      face and large blue eyes wearing a look of childish obedient solemnity, only half
      understanding what she did, yet knowing it was something great.</p>
     <p>It was very pretty to see her in the midst of the little gathering round the foundation, the
      sturdy workman smiling over his hod of mortar, Dr. Spencer's silver locks touching her flaxen
      curls as he held the shining trowel to her, and Harry's bright head and hardy face, as he
      knelt on one knee to guide the little soft hand, while Hector stood by, still and upright, his
      eyes fixed far away, as if his thoughts were roaming to the real founder.</p>
     <p>The Victoria coins were placed—Gertrude scooped up the mass of mortar, and spread it about
      with increasing satisfaction, as it went so smoothly and easily, prolonging the operation,
      till Harry drew her back, while, slowly down creaked the ponderous corner-stone into the bed
      that she had prepared for it, and, with a good will, she gave three taps on it with her
      trowel.</p>
     <p>Harry had taken her hand, when, at the sight of Dr. May, she
      <pb n="602"/> broke from him, and, as if taking sudden fright at her own unwonted part, ran,
      at full speed, straight up to her father, and clung to him, hiding her face as he raised her
      in his arms and kissed her.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile the strain arose:— 'Thou heavenly, new Jerusalem, Vision of peace, in Prophet's
      dream; With living stones, built up on high, And rising to the starry sky—' </p>
     <p>The blessing of peace seemed to linger softly and gently in the fragrant summer breeze, and
      there was a pause ere the sounds of voices awoke again.</p>
     <p>'Etheldred—' Mr. Wilmot stood beside her, ere going to unrobe in the school. 'Etheldred, you
       <hi>must</hi> once let me say, God bless you for this.'</p>
     <p>As she knelt beside her sister's sofa, on her return home, Margaret pressed something into
      her hand. 'If you please, dearest, give this to Dr. Spencer, and ask him to let it be set
      round the stem of the Chalice,' she whispered.</p>
     <p>Ethel recognized Alan Ernescliffe's pearl hoop, the betrothal ring, and looked at her sister
      without a word.</p>
     <p>'I wish it,' said Margaret, gently. 'I shall like best to know it there.'</p>
     <p>So Margaret joined in Alan's offering, and Ethel dared say no more, as she thought how the
      "relic of a frail love lost" was becoming the "token of endless love begun." There was more
      true union in this, than in clinging to the mere tangible emblem—for broken and weak is all
      affection that is not knit together above in the One Infinite Love.</p>

     <p>George Rivers had an antipathy to ladies' last words keeping the horses standing,
      and his wife and sister dutifully seated themselves in the carriage at once, without an
      attempt to linger.</p>
     <pb n="603"/>
     <p>Four of the young gentlemen were to walk across to Abbotstoke and dine at the Grange; and
      Tom, who, reasoning from analogy, had sent on his black tie and agate studs, was so dismally
      disconcerted on finding that Norman treated his own going as a matter of course, that Richard,
      whose chief use of his right of primogeniture was to set himself aside, discovered that he was
      wanted at home, and that Tom would be much better at the Grange, offering, at the same time,
      to send Norman's dressing things by Dr. Spencer.</p>
     <p>'Which,' observed Thomas, 'he would never have recollected for himself.'</p>
     <p>'Tom would have had to lend him the precious studs.'—'He would not have had them, who would
      wear imitation?' 'I say, Tom, what did you give for them?' 'Better ask what the Jew gave for
      them, that bought them at Windsor fair—not a bad imitation, either —pity they weren't
      Malachite; but, no doubt, the Jew thought green would be personal.' 'As if they had any
      business to talk, who didn't know a respectable stud when they saw it—Harry, especially, with
      his hat set on the back of his head, like a sailor on the stage—' (a leap to set it
      to-rights—a skirmish, knocking Tom nearly into the ditch). 'Fine experience of the stage—all
      came from Windsor fair.' 'Aye, Hector might talk, but didn't he pay a shilling to see the
      Irish giant. He wouldn't confess, but it was a famous take in—giant had potatoes in his
      shoes.' 'Not he; he was seven feet ten high.' 'Aye, when he stood upon a stool—Hector would
      swallow anything—even the lady of a million postage stamps had not stuck in his throat—he had
      made Margaret collect for her.' 'And, had not Tom, himself, got a bottle of ointment to get
      the red out of his hair?' —(great fury). 'His hair wasn't red—didn't want to change the
      colour—not half so red as Hector's own.' 'What was it then? lively auburn?' But for fear of
      Norman's losing his bearings, Harry would fetch a carrot, to compare. 'Better colour than
      theirs would ever be.' 'Then, what was the ointment for? to produce whiskers?—that was the
      reason Tom oiled himself like a Loyalty islander—his hair was so shiny, that Harry recommended
      a top-knot, like theirs, etc.'</p>
     <p>Norman was, like the others, in such towering glee, and took so full a share of the
      witticisms, that were the more noisily applauded, the worse they were, that Harry suggested
      that 'old June, had lost his way, and found his spirits in Drydale—he must have met with a
      private grog-shop in the plantations—would not Tom confess'—'not he; it was all in private. He
      thought it was laughing-gas, or the reaction of being fried all the morning, holding forth in
      that Town Hall. He had longed to make a speech himself—no end of the
      <pb n="604"/> good it would have done the old stagers to come out with something to the
      purpose. What would old Hoxton have thought of it?</p>
     <p>'Not you, Tom,' cried Hector!</p>
     <p>'Nay, it is the consequence of misanthropy at the detection of the frauds of sophisticated
      society,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'Perhaps it was Miss Rivers forsaking him. Was not that rather spider-hearted, Tom?'</p>
     <p>'Come Harry, it is time to have done. We are getting into civilized society—here's
      Abbotstoke.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Norman, he is very far gone! He takes that scarecrow for civilized society!'</p>
     <p>'Much better clothed than the society you have been accustomed to, July.' "What a prize his
      wardrobe would be to the Black Prince!" 'Don't insult your betters?' "Which? The scarecrow, or
      the Black Prince?"</p>
     <p>Norman tried to call his companions to order, for they were close upon the village, and he
      began to tax himself with unbecoming levity; the effect of spirits pitched rather low, which
      did not easily find their balance, under unwonted exhilaration, but Harry's antics were less
      easily repressed than excited, and if Tom had not heard the Grange clock strike half-past six,
      and had not been afraid of not having time to array himself, and watch over Harry's neckcloth,
      they would hardly have arrived in reasonable time. Dr. May had gone home, and there was no one
      in the drawing-room; but, as Norman was following the boys up-stairs, Flora opened her
      sitting-room door, and attracted his attention by silently putting her cold fingers into his
      hand, and drawing him into the room.</p>
     <p>'Dear Norman, this is pleasant,' she said, affectionately; but in a voice so sunken, that
      all gladness seemed to be dead within, and the effect was far more mournful than if she had
      not attempted to smile congratulation.</p>
     <p>'I will give you till Dr. Spencer comes,' she said. 'Then Norman can dress, and you must be
      a good child, and come down to me.'</p>
     <pb n="605"/>
     <p>The playfulness ill-suited the wan, worn face that seemed to have caught a grey tint from
      her rich poplin, her full toilette making the contrast almost more painful; and, as she closed
      the door, her brother could only exclaim, 'Poor Flora!'</p>
     <p>'She is so kind,' said the voice of the white figure that moved towards him. 'O, if we could
      comfort her!'</p>
     <p>'I trust to her own kindness working comfort to her, at last,' said Norman. 'But is she
      often thus?'</p>
     <p>'Whenever she is not bearing up for George's sake,' said Meta. 'She never says anything when
      she is alone with me, only she does not struggle with her looks.'</p>
     <p>'It must be very trying for you.'</p>
     <p>'Nay, I fell grateful to her for even so far relaxing the restraint —If I could but do her
      any good.'</p>
     <p>'You cannot help doing her good,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>Meta sighed, and shook her head slightly, as she said, 'She is so gentle and considerate. I
      think <hi>this</hi> has been no fresh pain to her to-day, but I cannot tell. The whole day has
      been a strange intermixture.'</p>
     <p>'The two strands of joy and grief have been very closely twisted,' said Norman. 'That rose
      is shedding its fragrant leaves in its glory, and there is much that should have chastened the
      overflowing gladness of to-day.'</p>
     <p>'As I was thinking,' whispered Meta, venturing nearer to him, and looking into his face with
      the sweet reliance of union in thought. She meant him to proceed, but he paused, saying, 'You
      were thinking—'</p>
     <p>'I had rather hear it from you.'</p>
     <p>'Was it not that we were taught to-day what is enduring, and gives true permanence and
      blessedness to such—to what there was between Ernescliffe and Margaret?'</p>
     <p>Her dewy eyes, and face of deep emotion, owned that he had interpreted her thought.</p>
     <p>'Theirs would, indeed, be a disheartening example,' he said, 'if it did not shew the
      strength and peace that distance, sickness, death, cannot destroy.'</p>
     <p>'Yes. To see that Church making Margaret happy as she lies smiling on her couch, is a lesson
      of lessons.'</p>
     <p>'That what is hallowed must be blest,' said Norman; 'whatever the sundry and manifold
      changes.'</p>
     <p>Each was far too humble to deny aloud any inequality with the goodness of Alan and Margaret,
      knowing that it would be at once disputed, trusting to time to prevent the over-estimate, and
      each believing the other was the one to bring the blessing.</p>
     <pb n="606"/>
     <p>'But Meta,' said Norman, 'have you heard nothing of—of the elders?'</p>
     <p>'O yes,' said Meta, smiling, 'have not you?'</p>
     <p>'I have seen no one.'</p>
     <p>'I have!' said Meta, merrily. 'Uncle Cosham is delighted. That speech of yours has
      captivated him. He calls me a wise little woman to have found out your first-rate abilities.
      There's for you, sir.'</p>
     <p>'I don't understand it! Surely he must be aware of my intentions?'</p>
     <p>'He said nothing about them; but, of course, Dr. May must have mentioned them.'</p>
     <p>'I should have thought so, but I cannot suppose—'</p>
     <p>'That he would be willing to let me go,' said Meta. 'But then you know he cannot help it,'
      added she, with a roguish look, at finding herself making one of her saucy independent
      speeches.</p>
     <p>'I believe you are taking a would-be Missionary, instead of Norman May!' he answered, with a
      sort of teazing sweetness.</p>
     <p>'All would-be Missionaries did not make dear papa so fond of them,' said Meta, very low;
      'and you would not be Norman May without such purposes.'</p>
     <p>'The purpose was not inspired at first by the highest motive,' said Norman; 'but it brought
      me peace, and, after the kind of dedication that I inwardly made of myself, in my time of
      trouble, it would take some weighty reason, amounting to a clear duty, or physical
      impossibility, to make me think I ought to turn back. I believe—' the tears rose to his eyes,
      and he brought out the words with difficulty—'that, if this greatest of all joys were likely
      to hinder me from my calling, I ought to seek strength to regard it as a temptation, and to
      forego it.'</p>
     <p>'You ought, if it were so,' said Meta, nevertheless holding him tighter. 'I could not bear
      to keep back a soldier. If this were last year, and I had any tie or duty here, it would be
      very hard. But no one needs me, and if the health I have always had be continued to me, I
      don't think I shall be much in the way. There,' drawing back a little, and trying to laugh off
      her feeling—'Only tell met at once if you think me still too much of a fine lady.'</p>
     <p>'I—you—a fine lady! Did anything ever give you the impression that I did?'</p>
     <p>'I shall not get poor Harry into a scrape, shall I? He told me that you said so, last
      spring, and I feared you judged me too truly.'</p>
     <p>After a few exclamations of utter surprise, it flashed on Norman. 'I know, I know—Harry
      interpreted my words in his own blunt fashion!'</p>
     <pb n="607"/>
     <p>'Then you did say something like it?'</p>
     <p>'No, but—but—In short, Meta, these sailors' imaginations go to great lengths. Harry had
      guessed more than I knew myself, before he had sailed, and taxed me with it. It was a subject
      I could not bear then, and I answered that you were too far beyond my hopes.'</p>
     <p>'Six years ago!' said Meta, slowly, blushing deeper and deeper. 'Some eyes saw it all that
      time, and you—and,' she added, laughing, though rather tearfully, 'I should never have known
      it, if Tom had not taken me through the plantations!'</p>
     <p>'Not if I had not discovered that your preferences did not lie—'</p>
     <p>'Among boudoirs and balls?' said Meta. 'Harry was right. You thought me a fine lady after
      all.'</p>
     <p>The gay taunt was cut short by a tap at the door, and Flora looked in. 'Dr. Spencer has
      brought your things, Norman. I am sorry to disturb you—but come down, Meta—I ran away very
      uncivilly to fetch you. I hope it is not too cruel,' as she drew Meta's arm into her own,' and
      added, 'I have not been able to speak to George.'</p>
     <p>Meta suspected that, in the wish to spare her, Flora had abstained from seeking him.</p>
     <p>The evening went off like any other evening—people ate and talked, thought Mrs. Rivers
      looking very ill, and Miss Rivers very pretty—Flora forced herself into being very friendly to
      Sir Henry, commiserating the disappointment to which she had led him; and she hoped that he
      suspected the state of affairs, though Tom, no longer supplanted by his elder brother, pursued
      Meta into the sheltered nook, where Flora had favoured her seclusion, to apologize for having
      left her to the guidance of poor Norman, whose head was with the blackamoors. It was all
      Harry's fault.</p>
     <p>'Nonsense, Tom,' said Harry; 'don't you think Norman is better company than you, any
      day?'</p>
     <p>'Then why did you not walk him off instead of me?' said Tom, turning round sharply.</p>
     <p>'Out of consideration for Meta. She will tell you that she was very much obliged to me—'
      Harry checked himself, for Meta was colouring so painfully, that his own sunburnt face caught
      the glow. He pushed Tom's slight figure aside with a commanding move of his broad hand, and
      said, 'I beg your pardon, upon my word, though I don't know what for.'</p>
     <p>'Nor I,' said Meta, rallying herself, and smiling. 'You have no pardon to beg. You will know
      it all to-morrow.'</p>
     <p>'Then I know it now,' said Harry, sheltering his face by leaning over the back of a chair,
      and taming the hearty gaiety of his voice. 'Well done, Meta—there's nothing like old June in
      all the world!
      <pb n="608"/> You may take my word for it, and I knew you would have the sense to find it
      out.'</p>
     <p>They were well out of sight, and Meta only answered by a good tight squeeze of his kind hand
      between both her own. Tom, suddenly recovering from his displeasure at being thrust aside,
      whisked round, dropped on a footstool before Meta, looked up in her face, and said, 'Hollo!'
      in such utter amazement that there was nothing for it but to laugh more uncontrollably than
      was convenient. 'Come along, Tom,' said Harry, pulling him up by force, 'she does not want any
      of your nonsense. We will not plague her now.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, Harry,' said Meta. 'I cannot talk rationally just yet. Don't think me unkind,
      Tom.'</p>
     <p>Tom sat in a sort of trance all the rest of the evening.</p>
     <p>Lord Cosham talked to Norman, who felt as if he were being patronized on false pretences,
      drew into his shell, and displayed none of his 'first-rate abilities.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer discussed his architecture with the Archdeacon; but his black eyes roamed
      heedfully after the young gentleman and lady, in the opposite corners of the room; and, as he
      drove home afterwards, with the youths, he hummed scraps of Scottish songs, and indulged in
      silent smiles.</p>
     <p>Those at home had been far more demonstrative. Dr. May had arrived, declaring himself the
      proudest Doctor in her Majesty's dominions, and Ethel needed nothing but his face to explain
      why, and tell her that dear old June's troubles were over, and their pretty little Meta was
      their own—a joy little looked for to attend their foundation stone.</p>
     <p>The dreaded conference with Lord Cosham had proved highly gratifying. There might be
      something in the fact that he could not help it, which assisted in his ready acquiescence, but
      he was also a sensible right-minded man, who thought that the largeness of Meta's fortune was
      no reason that it should be doubled; considered that, in the matter of connection, the May
      family had the advantage, and saw in Norman a young man whom anyone might have pleasure in
      bringing forward. Oxford had established confidence both in his character and talents, and his
      speech had been such as to impress an experienced man, like Lord Cosham, with an opinion of
      his powers, that prepared a welcome for him, such as no one could have dared to expect. His
      lordship thought his niece not only likely to be happier, but to occupy a more distinguished
      position with such a man as Norman May, than with most persons of ready-made rank and
      fortune.</p>
     <p>The blushing and delighted Dr. May had thought himself bound to speak of his son's designs,
      but he allowed that the project had
      <pb n="609"/> been formed under great distress of mind, and when he saw it treated by so good
      a man, as a mere form of disappointed love, he felt himself reprieved from the hardest
      sacrifice that he had ever been called on to make, loved little Meta the better for restoring
      his son, and once more gave a free course to the aspirations that Norman's brilliant boyhood
      had inspired. Richard took the same view, and the evening passed away in an argument—as if
      anyone had been disputing with them—the father reasoning loud, the son enforcing it low, that
      it had become Norman's duty to stay at home to take care of Meta, whose father would have been
      horrified at his taking her to the Antipodes. They saw mighty tasks for her fortune to effect
      in England, they enhanced each other's anticipations of Norman's career, overthrew abuses
      before him, heaped distinctions upon him, and had made him Prime Minister and settled his
      policy, before ten o'clock brought their schemes to a close.</p>
     <p>Mary gazed and believed; Margaret lay still and gently assented; Ethel was silent at first,
      and only when the fabric became extremely airy and magnificent, put in her word with a
      vehement dash at the present abuses, which grieved her spirit above all, and, whether
      vulnerable or not, Norman was to dispose of, like so many giants before Mr. Great-heart.</p>
     <p>She went upstairs, unable to analyze her sentiments. To be spared the separation would be
      infinite relief—all this prosperity made her exult—the fair girl at the Grange was the delight
      of her heart, and yet there was a sense of falling off; she disliked herself for being either
      glad or sorry, and could have quarrelled with the lovers for perplexing her feelings so
      uncomfortably.</p>
     <p>Though she sat up till the arty returned, she was inclined to be supposed in bed, so as o
      put off the moment of meeting; but Margaret, who she hoped was asleep, said from her pillow,
      'Ask dear Norman to let met give him one kiss.'</p>
     <p>She ran down headlong, clutched Norman as he was taking off his great-coat, told him that
      Margaret wanted him, and dragged him up without letting him go, till she reached the first,
      landing, where she stood still, saying breathlessly, "New Zealand."</p>
     <p>'If I wished to fail, she would keep me to it.'</p>
     <p>'I beg your pardon,' said Ethel, claiming heartily his caress. 'I was wrong to doubt either
      of you. Now, I know how to feel! But Margaret must not wait.'</p>
     <p>The happy youth, in the flush of love and joy, bent gently, almost tearfully, down in
      silence to the white form, half-seen in the twilight, whose hopes had fleeted away from earth,
      and who was calmly, softly gliding after them. Hardly a word was uttered, but of all the many
      heartfelt thoughts that had passed while the face
      <pb n="610"/> was pressed into Margaret's pillow, and her sympathizing arms round the neck,
      surely none was ever deeper, than was his prayer and vow that his affection should be like
      hers, unearthly, and therefore enduring.</p>
     <p>The embrace was all; Margaret must not be agitated, and, indeed, the events of the day had
      been too much for her, and the ensuing morning brought the fluttering of heart and prostration
      of strength, no longer a novelty and occasion of immediate terror, but the token of the waning
      power of life.</p>
     <p>Till she was better, her father had no thoughts for aught else, but, as with many another
      invalid, the relief from present distress was as cheering as if it had been recovery, and ere
      night, her placid look of repose had returned, and she was devising pretty greetings for her
      newest Daisy.</p>
     <p>Perhaps the sobering effect of these hours of anxiety was in Norman's favour, on entering
      into conversation with his father. Those visions, which had had their swing the night before,
      belonged to the earlier, more untamed period of Dr. May's life, and had melted away in the dim
      room, made sacred by lingering mementos of his wife, and in the sound of that panting breath
      and throbbing heart. His vehemence had been, after all, chiefly against his own misgivings,
      and when he heard of his son's resolution, and Meta's more than acquiescence, he was greatly
      touched, and recurred to his kind, sorrowful promise, that he would never be a stumbling-block
      in the path of his children. Still, he owned himself greatly allured by the career proposed by
      Lord Cosham, and thought Norman should consider the opportunities of doing good in, perhaps, a
      still more important and extensive field, than that which he had chosen.</p>
     <p>'Time was that I should have grasped at such a prospect,' said Norman; 'but I am not the man
      for it. I have too much ambition, and too little humility. You know, father, how often you
      have had to come to my rescue, when I was running after success as my prime object.'</p>
     <p>'Vanity fair is a dangerous place, but you who have sound principles and pure motives—'</p>
     <p>'How long would my motives be pure?' said Norman. 'Rivalry and party-spirit make me distrust
      my motives, and then my principles feel the shock. Other men are marked by station for such
      trials, and may be carried through them, but I am not.'</p>
     <p>'Yet some of these men are far from your equals.'</p>
     <p>'Not perhaps in speechifying,' said Norman, smiling; 'but in steadiness of aim, in patience,
      in callousness, in seeing one side of the question at once.'</p>
     <p>'You judge rightly for your own peace, you will be the happier;
      <pb n="611"/> I always doubted whether you had nerve to make your wits available.'</p>
     <p>'It may be cowardice,' said Norman, 'but I think not. I could burn for the combat; and if I
      had no scruples, I could enjoy bearing down such as—'</p>
     <p>Of course Dr. May burst in with a political name, and—'I wish you were at him!'</p>
     <p>'Whether I could is another matter,' said Norman, laughing; 'but the fact is, that I stand
      pledged; and if I embraced what to <hi>me</hi> would be a worldly career, I should be running
      into temptation, and could not expect to be shielded from it.'</p>
     <p>'Your old rule,' said Dr. May. 'Seek to be less rather than more. But there is another
      choice. Why not a parsonage at home?'.</p>
     <p>'Pleasant parishes are not in the same need,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'I wonder what poor old Rivers would say to you, if he knew what you want to do with his
      daughter! Brought up as she has been—to expose her to the roughness of a colonial life, such
      as I should hesitate about for your sisters.'</p>
     <p>'It is her own ardent desire.'</p>
     <p>'True, but are girlish enthusiasms to be trusted? Take care, Norman, take care of her—she is
      a bit of the choicest porcelain of human kind, and not to be rudely dealt with.'</p>
     <p>'No indeed, but she has the brave enterprising temper, to which I fully believe that actual
      work in a good cause, is far preferable to what she calls idleness. I do not believe that we
      are likely to meet with more hardship than she would gladly encounter, and would almost—nay,
      quite enjoy.'</p>
     <p>'You do not know what your aunt has had to go through.'</p>
     <p>'A few years make a great difference in a colony. Still, it may be right for me to go out
      alone and judge for her; but we shall know more if my aunt comes home.'</p>
     <p>'Yes, I could trust a good deal to her. She has much of your mother's sense. Well, you must
      settle it as you can with Meta's people! I do not think they love the pretty creature better
      than I have done from the first minute we saw her—don't you remember it, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'Remember it? Do I not? From the frosted cedar downwards! It was the first gem of spring in
      that dreary winter. What a Fairyland the Grange was to me!'</p>
     <p>'You may nearly say the same of me,' confessed Dr. May, smiling; 'the sight of that happy
      little sunny spirit, full of sympathy and sweetness, always sent me brighter on my way.
      Wherever you may be, Norman, I am glad you have her, being one apt to need a pocket
      sunbeam.'</p>
     <pb n="612"/>
     <p>'I hope my tendencies are in no danger of depressing her!' said Norman, startled. 'If
      so—'</p>
     <p>'No such thing—she will make a different man of you. You have been depressed by—that early
      shock, and the gap at our own fireside—all that we have shared together, Norman. To see you
      begin on a new score, with a bright home of your own, is the best in this world that I could
      wish for you, though I shall live over my own twenty-two years in thinking of you, and that
      sweet little fairy. But now go, Norman—she will be watching for you and news of Margaret. Give
      her all sorts of love from me.'</p>
     <p>Norman fared better with the uncle than he had expected. Lord Cosham, as a philanthropist,
      could not, with any consistency, set his face against missions, even when the cost came so
      near home; and he knew that opposition made the like intentions assume a heroic aspect that
      maintained them in greater force. He therefore went over the subject in a calm dispassionate
      manner, which exacted full and grateful consideration from the young man.</p>
     <p>The final compromise was, that nothing should be settled for a year, during which Norman
      would complete his course of study, and the matter might be more fully weighed. Mrs. Arnott
      would probably return, and bring experience and judgment, which would, or ought to, decide the
      question—though Meta had a secret fear that it might render it more complicated than ever.
      However, the engagement and the mission views had both been treated so much more favourably
      than could have been hoped, that they felt themselves bound to be patient and forbearing. As
      Meta said, 'If they shewed themselves wilful children, they certainly did not deserve to be
      trusted anywhere.'</p>
     <p>Lord Cosham made his niece listen to a kind exhortation not to press her influence towards a
      decision that might be repented, when too late to be repaired, without a degrading sense of
      failure—putting her in mind of the privations that would lose romance by their pettiness, and
      which money could not remedy; and very sensibly representing that the effect of these on
      temper and health was to be duly considered, as a serious impediment to usefulness.</p>
     <p>'It would be worse for him alone,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'That is not certain,' said her uncle. 'A broken-down wife is a terrible drag.'</p>
     <p>'I know it is so,' said Meta, firmly, 'but risks must be run, and he is willing to take the
      chance. I do not think it can be presumption, for, you know, I am strong; and Dr. May would
      say if he could not warrant me. I fancy household work would be more satisfactory, and less
      tiring, than doing a season thoroughly; and I mean to go through a course of Finchley manuals
      in preparation.'</p>
     <pb n="613"/>
     <p>'I hope you know what you are doing,' sighed her uncle. 'You see it all <hi>couleur de
       rose</hi> .'</p>
     <p>'I think not. It is because it is not <hi>couleur de rose</hi> that I am so much bent upon
      it. I have had plenty of that all my life. I expect much that will be very disagreeable and
      not at all heroic; but if I can only make Norman think it fun, that will be one purpose
      answered. I do believe he will do his work better for having me, and, at least, I shall pay
      his passage.'</p>
     <p>Her uncle shook his head, but did not try to say any more.</p>
     <p>George had begun by loud exclamations against the project, in which he was vehemently
      abetted by Tom, who primed him with all sorts of outrageous abuse of the niggers and
      cannibals, who would make Norman's coats out of all shape, and devour little Meta at a
      mouthful—predictions which Meta accepted most merrily, talking of herself so resignedly, as
      bound upon a spit, and calling out to be roasted slower and faster, that she safely conducted
      off their opposition by way of a standing joke. As to Norman's coats, she threatened to make
      them herself, and silenced Tom for ever by supposing, in malicious simplicity, that he must be
      able to teach her the most unexceptionable cut.</p>
     <p>Flora kept her opinions to herself. Only once, when urged to remonstrate, she said, 'I could
      not—I would not.'</p>
     <p>She was gently and touchingly considerate towards the lovers, silently but unobtrusively
      obviating all that could jar on their feelings, and employing her exquisite tact in the
      kindest manner.</p>
     <p>She released Meta from the expedition to Ryde, silencing scruples on the one hand, by a
      suggestion of 'poor Sir Henry,' and, on the other, by offering to exchange her for Mary. The
      first proposal made Mary take such a spring in her chair, with eyes so round, and cheeks so
      red, and such a shriek about Harry and the Bucephalus, that no one could have borne to say one
      word in opposition, even if it had not been the opinion of the Council that sea air would best
      repair Mary's strength.</p>
     <p>Ethel had some private fears of a scene, since it was one of Miss Bracy's idiosyncracies to
      be hurt whenever Mary was taken out of her hands; and she went to announce the design, in
      dread lest this shock should destroy the harmony that had prevailed for many months; nay, she
      almost believed, since the loss of the Alcestis had been known.</p>
     <p>She was agreeably surprised. Miss Bracy thought Mary in need of the change, and discussed
      both her and Blanche in so pleasant and sensible a manner, that Ethel was quite relieved. She
      partook in Mary's anticipations of pleasure, forwarded her preparations, and
      <pb n="614"/> was delighted with her promise of letters—promises that Mary bestowed so
      largely, in the fulness of her heart, that there were fears lest her whole time should be
      spent in writing.</p>
     <p>Her soft heart indulged in a shower of tears when she wished them all good-bye; and Ethel
      and Blanche found the house was very empty without her; but that was only till Meta came in
      from a walk with Norman, and, under the plea of trying to supply Mary's place, did the work of
      five Maries, and a great deal besides.</p>
     <p>Nothing could be happier than Meta's visit, brightening the house so that the Mays thought
      they had never known half her charms, helping whatever was going on, yet ready to play with
      Daisy, tell stories to Aubrey, hear Tom's confidences, talk to Margaret, read with Norman, and
      teach Richard singing for his school-children. The only vexation was, that everyone could not
      always engross her entirely; and Dr. May used to threaten that they should never spare her to
      that long-legged fellow, Norman.</p>
     <p>She had persuaded Bellairs to go and take care of Flora and Mary, instead of the French
      maid—a plan which greatly satisfied Margaret, who had never liked the looks of Coralie, and
      which Meta held to be a grand emancipation. She persuaded old nurse to teach her to be useful,
      and Margaret used to declare that she witnessed scenes as good as a play in her room, where
      the little dextrous scholar, apparently in jest, but really in sober earnest, wiled
      instruction from the old woman; and made her experiments, between smiles and blushes, and
      merrily glorying in results that promised that she would be a notable housewife. Whether it
      were novelty or not, she certainly had an aptitude and delight in domestic details, such as
      Ethel never could attain; and, as Dr. May said, the one performed by a little finger what the
      other laboured at with a great mind.</p>
     <p>In the school-room, Meta was as highly appreciated. She found an hour for helping Blanche in
      her music, and for giving, what was still more useful, an interest and spirit to studies,
      where, it must be owned, poor good Mary had been a dead weight. She enlivened Miss Bracy so
      much, and so often contrived a walk or a talk with her, that the saucy Blanche told Hector
      that she thought Ethel would be quite second-fiddle with Miss Bracy.</p>
     <p>No such thing. Miss Bracy's great delight was in having a listener for her enthusiasm about
      Miss Ethel. She had been lately having a correspondence with a former school-fellow, who was
      governess in a family less considerate than the Mays, and who poured out, in her letters,
      feelings much like those with which Miss Bracy had begun.</p>
     <p>Nothing could be more salutary than to find herself repeating all
      <pb n="615"/> Ethel's pieces of advice; and, one day, when her friend had been more distressed
      than usual, she called Ethel herself, to consult on her answer, owning how much she was
      reminded of herself.</p>
     <p>'Indeed,' she added, 'I am afraid it would only tease you to hear how much I am indebted to
      your decision and kindness—'</p>
     <p>'Nay,' said Ethel, laughing her awkward laugh. 'You have often had to forget my savage
      ways.'</p>
     <p>'Pray don't say that—'</p>
     <p>'I think,' said Ethel, breaking in, 'the philosophy is this: I believe that it is a trying
      life. I know teaching takes a great deal out of one; and loneliness may cause tendencies to
      dwell on fancied slights in trifles, that might otherwise be hurried over. But I think the
      thing is, to pass them over, and make a conscience of turning one's mind to something
      fresh—'</p>
     <p>'As you made me do, when you brought me amusing books, and taught me botany—'</p>
     <p>'And, still more, when you took to working for the Infant School. Yes, I think the way to be
      happy and useful is to get up many interests, so as to be fresh and vigorous, and think not at
      all of personalities. There's a truism!'</p>
     <p>'Very true, though,' said Miss Bracy. 'Indeed, all your kindness and consideration would
      never have done me half the good they have, dear Miss Ethel, if you had not taught me that
      referring all to one's own feelings and self is the way to be unhappy.'</p>
     <p>'Just so,' said Ethel. 'It is the surest way for anyone to be miserable.'</p>
     <p>'If I could only persuade poor dear Ellen to think that even if a slight were real, it ought
      to be borne forgivingly, and not brooded over. Ah! you are laughing; perhaps you have said the
      same of me.'</p>
     <p>'You would forgive it now, I think,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I never thought I did not forgive. I did not see that brooding over vexations was not
      pardoning them. I have told her so now; and, oh! if she could but have seen how true sorrows
      are borne here, she would be cured, like me, of making imaginary ones.'</p>
     <p>'None could help being better for living with papa,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>Ethel made Miss Bracy happy by a kiss before she left her. It was a cheering belief that,
      whatever the future trials of her life might be, the gentle little lady would meet them with a
      healthier mind, more vigorous in overlooking troubles, and without punctilious sensitiveness
      on the look-out for affronts. "Believing all things, bearing all things, hoping all things,
      enduring all things," would be to her the true secret of serenity of spirits.</p>
     <p>Ethel might not have been blameless or consistent in her dealings
      <pb n="616"/> in this difficult intercourse, but her kind heart, upright intention, and force
      of character, had influence far beyond her own perception. Indeed, she knew not that she had
      personal influence at all, but went on in her own straight-forward humility.</p>

     <p>Etheldred May and Meta Rivers were together in the drawing-room. The time-piece
      pointed towards ten o'clock, but the tea-things were on the table, prepared for a meal, the
      lamp shone with a sort of consciousness, and Ethel moved restelessly about, sometimes settling
      her tea equipage, sometimes putting away a stray book, or resorting by turns to her book, or
      to work a red and gold scroll on coarse canvas, on the other end of which Meta was
      employed.</p>
     <p>'Nervous, Ethel?' said Meta, looking up with a merry provoking smile, knowing how much the
      word would displease.</p>
     <p>'That is for you,' retorted Ethel, preferring to carry the war into the enemy's quarters.
      'What, don't you know that prudent people say that your fate depends on her report?'</p>
     <p>'At least,' said Meta, laughing; 'she is a living instance that everyone is not eaten up,
      and we shall see if she fulfils Tom's prediction, of being tattooed, or of having a slice out
      of the fattest part of her cheek.'</p>
     <p>'I know very well,' said Ethel, 'the worse she said it would be, the more you would go.'</p>
     <pb n="617"/>
     <p>'Not quite that,' said Meta, blushing, and looking down.</p>
     <p>'Come! don't be deceitful!' said Ethel. 'You know very well that you are still more bent on
      it than you were last year.'</p>
     <p>'To be sure I am!' said Meta, looking up with a sudden beamy flash of her dark eyes. 'Norman
      and I know each other so much better now,' she added, rather falteringly.</p>
     <p>'Aye! I know you are ready to go through thick and thin, and that is why I give my consent
      and approbation. You are not to be stopped for nonsense.'</p>
     <p>'Not for nonsense, certainly,' said Meta, 'but—' and her voice became tremulous—'if Dr. May
      deliberately said it would be wrong, and that I should be an encumbrance and perplexity, I am
      making up my mind to the chance.'</p>
     <p>'But what would you do?' asked Ethel.</p>
     <p>'I don't know. You should not ask such questions, Ethel.'</p>
     <p>'Well! it won't happen, so it is no use to talk about it,' said Ethel. 'Fancy my having made
      you cry!'</p>
     <p>'Very silly of me,' said Meta, brightening and laughing, but sighing. 'I am only afraid Mrs.
      Arnott may think me individually unfit for the kind of life, as if I could not do what other
      women can. Do I look so?'</p>
     <p>'You look as if you were meant to be put under a glass case!' said Ethel, surveying the
      little elegant figure, whose great characteristic was a look of exquisite finish, not only in
      the features and colouring, the turn of the head, and the shape of the small rosy-tipped
      fingers, but in everything she wore, from the braids of black silk hair, to the little shoe on
      her foot, and even in the very lightness and gaiety of her movements.</p>
     <p>'Oh! Ethel!' cried Meta, springing up in dismay, and looking at herself in the glass. 'What
      is the matter with me? Do tell me!'</p>
     <p>'You'll never get rid of it,' said Ethel, 'unless you get yourself tattooed! Even separation
      from Bellairs hasn't answered. And, after all, I don't think it would be any satisfaction to
      Norman, or papa. I assure you, Meta, whatever you may think of it, it is not so much bother to
      be prettier than needful, as it is to be uglier than needful.'</p>
     <p>'What is needful?' said Meta, much amused.</p>
     <p>'I suppose to be like Mary, so that nobody should take notice of one, but that one's own
      people may have the satisfaction of saying, "she is pleasing," or "she is in good looks." I
      think Gertrude will come to that. That's one comfort.'</p>
     <p>'That is your own case, Ethel. I have heard those very things said of you.'</p>
     <pb n="618"/>
     <p>'Of my hatchet face!' said Ethel, contemptuously. 'Some one must have been desperately bent
      on flattering the Member's family.'</p>
     <p>'I could repeat more,' said Meta, 'if I were to go back to the Commemoration, and to the day
      you went home.'</p>
     <p>Ethel crimsoned, and made a sign with her hand, exclaiming, 'Hark!'</p>
     <p>'It went past.'</p>
     <p>'It was the omnibus. She must be walking down!' Ethel breathed short, and wandered aimlessly
      about—Meta put her arm round her waist.</p>
     <p>'I did not think this would be so much to you,' she said.</p>
     <p>'O Meta, it seems like dear mamma coming to see how we have been going on. And then papa! I
      wish I had gone up to the station with him.'</p>
     <p>'He has Richard.'</p>
     <p>'Aye, but I am afraid Margaret is listening and will be restless, and have a palpitation,
      and I can't go and see, or I shall disturb her. O, I wish it were over.'</p>
     <p>Meta stroked her, and soothed her, and assured her that all would do well, and presently
      they heard the click of the door. Ethel flew into the hall, where she stopped short, her heart
      beating high at the sound of overpoweringly familiar accents.</p>
     <p>She was almost relieved by detecting otherwise little resemblance; the height was nearly the
      same, but there was not the plump softness of outline. Mrs. Arnott was small, thin, brisk and
      active, with a vivacious countenance, once evidently very fair and pretty, but aged and worn
      by toil, not trouble, for the furrows were the traces of smiles around her merry mouth, and
      beautiful blue eyes, that had a tendency to laugh and cry both at once. Dr. May, who had led
      her into the light, seemed to be looking her all over, while Richard was taking her wraps from
      her, and Ethel tried to encourage herself to go forward.</p>
     <p>'Aye! said the Doctor,' kissing her. 'I <hi>see</hi> you Flora now. I have found you
      again.'</p>
     <p>'I found you as soon as I heard your voice, Richard,' said she. 'And now for the
      bairnies.'</p>
     <p>'Here is one, but there is but a poor show forthcoming to-night. Do you know her?'</p>
     <p>There was an unspeakable joy in being pressed in aunt Flora's arms, like a returning beam
      from the sunshine of seven years ago.</p>
     <p>'This must be Ethel! My dear, how you tower above me—you that I left in arms! And,' as she
      advanced into the drawing-room —'why, surely this is not Margaret.'</p>
     <p>'A Margaret—not <hi>the</hi> Margaret. I wish I were,' said Meta, as
      <pb n="619"/> Mrs. Arnott stood with an arm on her shoulder, in the midst of an embrace, Dr.
      May enjoying her perplexity and Meta's blushes. 'See, Flora, these black locks never belonged
      to Calton Hill daisies, yet a daisy of my own she is—Can't you guess?'</p>
     <p>'Miss Rivers!' exclaimed Mrs. Arnott; and though she kissed her cordially, Meta suspected a
      little doubt and disappointment.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Dr. May. 'We change Mary for this little woman as Flora's lady-in-waiting, when
      she and her husband go out yachtting and shooting.'</p>
     <p>'Flora and her husband! There's a marvellous sound! Where are they?'</p>
     <p>'They are staying at Eccleswood Castle,' said Ethel; 'and Mary with them. They would have
      been at home to receive you, but your note yesterday took us all by surprise. Norman is away
      too, at a College meeting.'</p>
     <p>'And Margaret—my Margaret! Does not she come down-stairs?'</p>
     <p>'Ah! poor dear,' said Dr. May, 'she has not been in this room since that sultry day in
      July.'</p>
     <p>'The eighteenth,' said Richard; the precision of the date marking but too well the
      consciousness that it was an epoch.</p>
     <p>'We can keep her quieter up-stairs,' said Dr. May; 'but you must not see her to-night. She
      will enjoy you very much to-morrow; but excitement at night always does her harm, so we put
      her to bed, and told her to think about no one.'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott looked at him as if longing, but dreading, to ask further, and allowed her
      nephew and nice to seat her at the table, and attend to her wants, before she spoke again.
      'Then the babies.'</p>
     <p>'We don't keep babies, Gertrude would tell you,' said Dr. May. 'There are three great
      creatures, whom Ethel barbarously ordered off to bed. Ethel is master here, you must know,
      Flora—we all mind what she says.'</p>
     <p>'O papa,' pleaded Ethel, distressed, 'you know it was because I thought numbers might be
      oppressive.'</p>
     <p>'I never dispute,' said Dr. May. 'We bow to a beneficial despotism, and never rebel, do we,
      Meta?'</p>
     <p>Seeing that Ethel took the imputation to heart, Meta rejoined. 'You are making Mrs. Arnott
      think her the strong minded woman of the family, who winds up the clock and cuts the
      bread.'</p>
     <p>'No; that she makes you do, when the boys are away.'</p>
     <p>'Of course,' said Ethel, 'I can't be vituperated about hunches of bread. I have quite enough
      to bear on the score of tea.'</p>
     <p>'Your tea is very good,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'See how they propitiate her,' maliciously observed the Doctor.</p>
     <pb n="620"/>
     <p>'Not at all; it is Richard standing up for his pupil,' said Ethel. 'It is all very well now,
      with people who know the capacities of mortal tea; but the boys expect it to last from seven
      o'clock to ten, through an unlimited number of cups, till I have announced that a teapot must
      be carved on my tombstone, with an epitaph, "Died of unreasonable requirements."'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott looked from one to the other, amused, observant, and perceiving that they were
      all under that form of shyness, which brings up family wit to hide embarrassment or
      emotion.</p>
     <p>'Is Harry one of these unreasonable boys?' she asked. 'My dear Harry—I presume Ethel has not
      sent him to bed. Is there any hope of my seeing him?'</p>
     <p>'Great hope,' said Dr. May. 'He has been in the Baltic fleet, a pretty little summer trip,
      from which we expect him to return any day. My old Lion! I am glad you had him for a little
      while, Flora.'</p>
     <p>'Dear fellow! his only fault was being homesick, and making me catch the infection.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad you did not put off your coming,' said Dr. May, gravely.</p>
     <p>'You are in time for the Consecration,' said Richard.</p>
     <p>'Ah! Cocksmoor! When will it take place?'</p>
     <p>'Oh St. Andrew's day. It is St. Andrew's Church, and the Bishop fixed the day, otherwise it
      is a disappointment that Hector cannot be present.'</p>
     <p>'Hector?'</p>
     <p>'Hector Ernescliffe—poor Alan's brother, whom we don't well know from ourselves.'</p>
     <p>'And you are Curate, Ritchie?' said his aunt, 'if I may still call you so. You are not a bit
      altered from the mouse you used to be.'</p>
     <p>'Church mouse to Cocksmoor,' said Dr. May, 'nearly as poor. We are to invest his patrimony
      in a parsonage, as soon as our architect in ordinary can find time for it. Spencer—you
      remember him?'</p>
     <p>'I remember how you and he used to be inseparable! And he has settled down, at last, by your
      side?'</p>
     <p>'The two old Doctors hope to bolster each other up till Mr. Tom comes down with modern
      science in full force. That boy will do great things—he has as clear a head as I ever
      knew.'</p>
     <p>'And more—' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Aye, as sound a heart. I must find you his tutor's letter, Flora. They have had a row in
      his tutor's house at Eton, and our boys made a gallant stand for the right, Tom especially,
      guarding the little fellows, in a way that does one good to hear of.'</p>
     <p>'"I must express my strong sense of gratitude for his truth, uprightness, and moral
      courage,"' quoted Meta.</p>
     <pb n="621"/>
     <p>'Ah, ha! you have learnt it by heart! I know you copied it out for Norman, who has the best
      right to rejoice.'</p>
     <p>'You have a set of children to be proud of, Richard!' exclaimed Mrs. Arnott.</p>
     <p>'To be surprised at—to be thankful for,' said Dr. May, almost inarticulately.</p>
     <p>To see her father so happy with Mrs. Arnott necessarily drew Ethel's heart towards her; and,
      when they had bidden him good night, the aunt instantly assumed a caressing confidence towards
      Ethel, particularly comfortable to one consciously backward and awkward, and making her feel
      as intimate as if the whole space of her rational life had not elapsed since their last
      meeting.</p>
     <p>'Must you go, my dear?' said her aunt, detaining her over her fire. 'I can't tell how to
      spare you. I want to hear of your dear father. He looks aged and thin, Ethel, and yet that
      sweet expression is the same as ever. Is he very anxious about poor Margaret?'</p>
     <p>'Not exactly anxious,' said Ethel, mournfully—'there is not much room for that.'</p>
     <p>'My dear Ethel—you don't mean?—I thought—'</p>
     <p>'I suppose we ought to have written more fully,' said Ethel, 'but it has been very gradual,
      and we never say it to ourselves. She is as bright, and happy, and comfortable as ever, in
      general, and, perhaps, may be so for a long time yet, but each attack weakens her.'</p>
     <p>'What kind of attack?'</p>
     <p>'Faintness—sinking. It is suspended action of the heart. The injury to the spine deranged
      the system, and then the long suspense, and the shock— It is not one thing more than another,
      but it must go on. Dr. Spencer will tell you. You won't ask papa too much about it?'</p>
     <p>'No, indeed. And he bears it—'</p>
     <p>'He bears everything. Strength comes up out of his great lovingness. But, oh! I sometimes
      long that he may never have any more sorrows.'</p>
     <p>'My poor child!' said Mrs. Arnott, putting her arm round her niece's waist.</p>
     <p>Ethel rested her head on her shoulder. 'Aunt Flora! aunt Flora! If any words could tell what
      Margaret has been ever since we were left. O, don't make me talk or think of ourselves without
      her. It is wrong to wish. And when you see her, that dear face of her's will make you happy in
      the present. Then,' added Ethel, not able to leave off with such a subject, 'you have our
      Norman to see.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! Norman's project is too delightful to us; but I fear what it may be to your
      father.'</p>
     <pb n="622"/>
     <p>'He gives dear Norman, as his most precious gift, the flower and pride of us all.'</p>
     <p>'But, Ethel, I am quite frightened at Miss Rivers's looks. Is it possible that—'</p>
     <p>'Aunt Flora,' broke in Ethel, 'don't say a word against it. The choicest goods wear the
      best; and whatever woman can do, Meta Rivers can. Norman is a great tall fellow, as clever as
      possible, but perfectly <hi>feckless</hi> . If you had him there alone, he would be a bee
      without a queen—'</p>
     <p>'Well, but—'</p>
     <p>'Listen,' continued Ethel. 'Meta is a concentration of spirit and energy, delights in
      practical matters, is twice the housewife I am, and does all like an accomplishment. Between
      them, they will make a noble missionary—'</p>
     <p>'But she looks—'</p>
     <p>'Hush,' continued the niece. You will think me domineering; but please don't give any
      judgment without seeing; for they look to you as an arbitrator, and casual words will
      weigh.'</p>
     <p>'Thank you, Ethel; perhaps you are right. When does he think of coming out?'</p>
     <p>'When he is ordained—some time next year.'</p>
     <p>'Does she live with you?'</p>
     <p>'I suppose she lives with Flora; but we always manage to get her when Norman is at
      home.'</p>
     <p>'You have told me nothing of Flora or Mary.'</p>
     <p>'I have little <hi>real</hi> to tell. Good old Mary! I dare say Harry talked to you
      plentifully of her. She is a—a nice old darling,' said Ethel, fondly. 'We want her again very
      much, and did not quite bargain for the succession of smart visits that she has been
      paying.'</p>
     <p>'With Flora?'</p>
     <p>'Yes. Unluckily George Rivers has taken an aversion to the Grange, and I have not seen Flora
      this whole year.'</p>
     <p>Ethel stopped short, and said that she must not keep Margaret expecting her. Perhaps her
      aunt guessed that she had touched the true chord of anxiety.</p>
     <p>The morning brought a cheering account of Margaret; and Mrs. Arnott was to see her directly
      after breakfast. In the meantime, the firm limbs, blue eyes, and rosy face of Gertrude seemed
      a fair representation of the little bridesmaid, whom she remembered.</p>
     <p>A very different niece did she find up-stairs, though the smiling, overflowing eyes, and the
      fond, eager look of recognition, as if asking to be taken to her bosom, had in them all the
      familiarity of old
      <pb n="623"/> tenderness. 'Auntie! dear auntie! that you should have come back to me
      again!'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott fondly caressed her, but could not speak at first, for even her conversation
      with Ethel had not prepared her for so wasted, and broken an appearance. Dr. May spoke briskly
      of Margaret's having behaved very well, and slept like a good child, told Margaret where he
      had to go that morning, and pointed out to Mrs. Arnott some relics of herself still remaining;
      but the nervous tremulousness of manner did not much comfort her, although Margaret answered
      cheerfully. Nothing was so effectual in composing the aunt, as Aubrey's coming headlong in to
      announce the gig, and to display to Margaret his last design for a Cathedral—drawing plans
      being just now his favourite sport.</p>
     <p>'Architecture is all our rage at present,' said Margaret, as her father hurried away.</p>
     <p>'I am so glad to have come in for the Consecration!' said Mrs. Arnott, following her niece's
      lead. 'Is that a model of the Church?'</p>
     <p>'Oh! yes,' cried Margaret, lighting up. 'Richard made it for me.'</p>
     <p>'May I shew it to aunt Flora?' said Aubrey.</p>
     <p>'Bring it here, if you can lift it,' said Margaret; and, aunt Flora helping, the great
      cumbersome thing was placed beside her, whilst she smiled and welcomed it like a child, and
      began an eager exhibition. Was it not a beautiful little pierced spire?—that was an
      extravagance of Dr. Spencer's own. Papa said he could not ask Captain Gordon to sanction
      it—the model did it no justice, but it was so very beautiful in the rich creamy stone rising
      up on the moor, and the blue sky looking through, and it caught the sunset lights so
      beautifully. So animated was her description, that Mrs. Arnott could not help asking, 'Why, my
      dear, when have you seen it?'</p>
     <p>'Never,' said Margaret, with her sweet smile. 'I have never seen Cocksmoor; but Dr. Spencer
      and Meta are always sketching it for me, and Ethel would not let an effect pass without
      telling me. I shall hear how it strikes you next.'</p>
     <p>'I hope to see it by-and-by. What a comfortable deep porch! If we could build such Churches
      in the Colonies, Margaret!'</p>
     <p>'See what little Meta will do for you! Yes, we had the porch deep for a shelter—that is
      copied from the west-door of the Minster, and is it not a fine high-pitched roof? John Taylor,
      who is to be clerk, could not understand its being open; he said, when he saw the timbers,
      that a man and his family might live up among them. They are noble oak beams; we would not
      have any sham— here Aubrey, take off the roof, and auntie will see the shape.'</p>
     <pb n="624"/>
     <p>'Like the ribs of a ship,' explained Aubrey, unconscious that the meaning was deeper than
      his sister could express, and he continued: 'Such fine oak beams! I rode with Dr. Spencer one
      day last year to choose them. It is a two-aisled Church, you see, that a third may be
      added.'</p>
     <p>Ethel came up as Aubrey began to absorb the conversation. 'Lessons, Aubrey,' she said. 'So,
      Margaret, you are over your dear model?'</p>
     <p>'Not forestalling you too much I hope, Ethel, dear,' said Margaret; 'as you will shew her
      the Church itself.'</p>
     <p>'You have the best right,' said Ethel; 'but come, Aubrey, we must not dawdle.'</p>
     <p>'I will shew you the stones I laid myself, aunt Flora,' said Aubrey, running off without
      much reluctance.</p>
     <p>'Ethel has him in excellent order,' said Mrs. Arnott.</p>
     <p>'That she has; she brings him on beautifully, and makes him enjoy it. She teaches him
      arithmetic in some wonderful scientific way that nobody can understand but Norman, and he not
      the details; but he says it is all coming right, and will make him a capital mathematical
      scholar, though he cannot add up pounds shillings and pence.</p>
     <p>'I expected to be struck with Ethel,' said Mrs. Arnott; 'and—'</p>
     <p>'Well,' said Margaret, waiting.</p>
     <p>'Yes, she does exceed my expectations. There is something curiously winning in that quaint,
      quick, decisive manner of hers. There is so much soul in the least thing she does, as if she
      could not be indifferent for a moment.'</p>
     <p>'Exactly—exactly so,' said Margaret, delighted. 'It is really doing everything with all her
      might. Little, simple, everyday matters did not come naturally to her as to other people, and
      the having had to make them duties has taught her to do them with that earnest manner, as if
      there were a right and wrong to her in each little mechanical household office.'</p>
     <p>'Harry described her to me thus,' said Mrs. Arnott, smiling: '"As to Ethel, she is an odd
      fish; but Cocksmoor will make a woman of her after all."'</p>
     <p>'Quite true!' cried Margaret. 'I should not have thought Harry had so much discernment in
      those days. Cocksmoor gave the stimulus, and made Ethel what she is. Look there—over the
      mantel-piece, are the designs for the painted glass, all gifts, except the East window. That
      one of St. Andrew introducing the lad with the loaves and fishes is Ethel's window. It is the
      produce of the hoard she began this time seven years, when she had but one sovereign in the
      world. She kept steadily on with it, spending
      <pb n="625"/> nothing on herself that she could avoid, always intending it for the Church, and
      it was just enough to pay for this window.'</p>
     <p>'Most suitable,' said Mrs. Arnott.</p>
     <p>'Yes; Mr. Wilmot and I persuaded her into it; but I do not think she would have allowed it,
      if she had seen the application we made of it—the gift of her girlhood blessed and extended.
      Dear King Etheldred, it is the only time I ever cheated her.'</p>
     <p>'This is a beautiful east window. And this little one—St. Margaret I see.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! papa would not be denied choosing that for his subject. We reproached him with
      legendary saints, and overwhelmed him with antiquarianism, to shew that the Margaret of the
      dragon was not the Margaret of the daisy; but he would have it; and said we might thank him
      for not setting his heart on St. Etheldreda.'</p>
     <p>'This one?'</p>
     <p>'That is mine,' said Margaret, very low; and her aunt abstained from remark, though unable
      to look, without tears, at the ship of the Apostles, the calming of the storm, and the scroll,
      with the verse— 'He bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.' Beneath were the
      initials, 'A. H. E.,' and the date of the year, the only memorials of the founder.</p>
     <p>Margaret next drew attention to St. Andrew with his Cross— Meta's gift. 'And, besides,' she
      said, 'George Rivers made us a beautiful present, which Meta hunted up. Old Mr. Rivers,
      knowing no better, once bought all the beautiful carved fittings of a Chapel in France,
      meaning to fit up a library with them; but, happily, he never did, and a happy notion came
      into Meta's head, so she found them out, and Dr. Spencer has adapted them, and set them all to
      rights; and they are most exquisite. You never saw such foliage.'</p>
     <p>Thus Margaret proceeded with the description of everything in the Church, and all the little
      adventures of the building, as if she could not turn away from the subject; and her aunt
      listened and wondered, and, when called away, that Margaret might rest before nurse came to
      dress her, she expressed her wonder to Meta.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' was the answer; 'it is her chief occupation and interest. I do not mean that she has
      not always her own dear full sympathy for everyone's concerns, but Cocksmoor is <hi>her</hi>
      concern, almost more than even Ethel's. I think she could chronicle every stage in the
      building better than Dr. Spencer himself, and it is her daily delight to hear his histories of
      his progress. And not only with the Church but the people; she knows all about every family;
      Richard and Ethel tell her all their news; she talks over the school with the mistress every
      Sunday, and you cannot think what a feeling there
      <pb n="626"/> is for her at Cocksmoor. A kind message from Miss May has an effect that the
      active workers cannot always produce.'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott saw that Meta was right, when, in the afternoon, she walked, with her nieces, to
      see Cocksmoor. It was not a desolate sight as in old times, for the fair edifice, rising on
      the slope, gave an air of protection to the cottages, which-seemed now to have a centre of
      unity, instead of lying forlorn and scattered. Nor were they as wretched in themselves, for
      the impulse of civilization had caused windows to be mended and railings to be tidied, and
      Richard promoted, to the utmost, cottage gardening, so that, though there was an air of
      poverty, there was no longer an appearance of reckless destitution and hopeless neglect.</p>
     <p>In the cottages, Mrs. Taylor had not entirely ceased to speak with a piteous voice, even
      though she told of the well-doing of her girls at service; but Granny Hall's merry content had
      in it something now of principle, and Sam had married a young Fordholm wife, who promised to
      be a pattern for Cocksmoor. Everyone asked after Miss May, with a tenderness and affection
      that Mrs. Arnott well appreciated; and when they went into the large fresh school, where
      Richard was hearing a class, Cherry Elwood looked quite cheered and enlivened by hearing that
      she had been able to enjoy seeing her aunt. Mrs. Arnott was set to enlighten the children
      about the little brown girls whom she was wont to teach, and came away with a more brilliant
      impression of their intelligence than she might have had, if she had not come to them fresh
      from the Antipodes.</p>
     <p>She had to tell Margaret all her impressions on her return, and very pretty smiles repaid
      her commendations. She understood better the constant dwelling on the subject, as she
      perceived how little capable Margaret was of any employment. The book, the writing materials,
      and work-basket were indeed placed by her side, but very seldom did the feeble fingers engage
      in any of the occupations once so familiar—now and then a pencilled note would be sent to
      Flora, or to Hector Ernescliffe, or a few stitches be set in her work, or a page or two turned
      of a book, but she was far more often perfectly still, living, assuredly in no ordinary sphere
      of human life, but never otherwise than cheerful, and open to the various tidings and
      interests which, as Ethel had formerly said, shifted before her like scenes in a magic
      lantern, and, perhaps, with less of substance than in those earlier days, when her work among
      them was not yet done, and she was not, as it were, set aside from them. They were now little
      more than shadows reflected from the world whence she was passing.</p>
     <p>Yet her home was not sad. When Dr. Spencer came in the evening, and old Edinburgh stories
      were discussed, Dr. May talked
      <pb n="627"/> with spirit, and laughed with the merry note that Mrs. Arnott so well
      remembered, and Meta Rivers chimed in with her gay, saucy repartees, nor, though Richard was
      always silent, and Ethel's brow seemed to bear a weight of thought, did it seem as if their
      spirits were depressed; while there was certainly no restraint on the glee of Blanche, Aubrey,
      and Gertrude, who were running into Margaret's room, and making as much noise there as they
      chose.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott was at home with the whole family from the first, and in everyone's confidence;
      but what she enjoyed above all was, the sitting in Margaret's room in the morning, when there
      was no danger of interruption, the three children being all safe captives to their lessons,
      and Meta, in Richard's workshop, illuminating texts on zinc scrolls for the Church.</p>
     <p>Margaret came out more in these interviews. It had been a kind of shyness that made her talk
      so exclusively of the Church at the first meeting; she had now felt her way, and knew
      again—and realized—the same kind aunt with whom she had parted in her childhood, and now far
      dearer, since she herself was better able to appreciate her, and with a certain resemblance to
      her mother, that was unspeakably precious and soothing to one deprived, as Margaret had been,
      at the commencement of her illness and anxiety.</p>
     <p>She could hardly see her aunt come near her, without thanking her for having come home, and
      saying how every time she awoke, it was with the sense that something was comfortable, then
      remembering it was aunt Flora's being in the house. She seemed to have a feeling, as if
      telling everything to her aunt were like rendering up her account to her mother, and, at
      different times, she related the whole, looking back on the various decisions she had had to
      make or to influence, and reviewing her own judgments, though often with self-blame, not with
      acuteness of distress, but rather with a humble trust in the Infinite Mercy that would atone
      for all shortcomings and infirmities, truly sorrowed for.</p>
     <p>On the whole it was a peaceful and grateful retrospect; the brothers all doing so well in
      their several ways, and such a comfort to their father. Tom, concerning whom she had made the
      greatest mistake, might be looked upon as rescued by Norman. Aubrey, Margaret said, smiling,
      was Ethel's child, and had long been off her mind; Hector, to her quite a brother, would miss
      her almost more than her own brothers, but good honest fellow, he had a home here; and,
      whispered Margaret, smiling and glowing a little, "don't tell anyone, for it is a secret of
      secrets. Hector told me one evening that, if he could be very steady, he hoped he might yet
      have Blanche at Maplewood. Poor little White Mayflower, it won't be for want of liking on her
      part, and she so blushes and watches when Hector
      <pb n="628"/> comes near, that I sometimes think he may have said something like it to
      her."</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott gave no opinion on the plan for Norman and Meta; but Margaret, however, took all
      for granted, and expressed warm hopes for their sakes, that they would go out with Mrs.
      Arnott; then, when the suggestion seemed to astonish her aunt, who thought they were waiting
      for his Ordination, she said, 'The fact is, that he would like to be ordained where he is to
      work; but I believe they do not like to say anything about the wedding, because of me. Now, of
      all persons, I must chiefly rejoice in what may help to teach in those islands. I cannot bear
      to be a hindrance. Whatever happens, Aunt Flora, will you take care that they know this?'</p>
     <p>As to her father, Margaret was at rest. He had much more calmness than when he was more new
      to grief, and could bear far more patiently and hopefully than at first. He lived more on his
      affections above, and much as he loved those below, he did not rest in them as once, and could
      better afford to have them removed. 'Besides,' said Margaret, serenely, 'it has been good for
      him to have been gradually weaned from depending on me, so that it is Ethel who is really
      necessary to him.'</p>
     <p>For herself, Margaret was perfectly content and happy. She knew the temptation of her
      character had been to be the ruler and manager of everything, and she saw it had been well for
      her to have been thus assigned the part of Mary, rather than of Martha. She remembered with
      thankful joy the engagement with Alan Ernescliffe, and though she still wore tokens of
      mourning for him, it was with a kind of pleasure in them. There had been so little promise of
      happiness from the first, that there was far more peace in thinking of him as sinking into
      rest in Harry's arms, than as returning to grieve over her decline; and that last gift of his,
      the Church, had afforded her continual delight, and above all other earthly pursuits, smoothed
      away the languor and weariness of disease, as she slowly sank to join him. Now that her aunt
      had come to bring back a sunbeam of her childhood, Margaret declared that she had no more
      grief or care, except one, and that a very deep and sad one—namely, poor Flora.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott had at first been inclined to fear that her goddaughter was neglecting her own
      family, since she had not been at home this whole year, but the slightest betrayal of this
      suspicion roused Margaret to an eager defence. She had not a doubt that Flora would gladly
      have been with her, but she believed that she was not acting by her own choice, or more truly,
      that her husband was so devoted to her, that she felt the more bound to follow his slightest
      wishes, however contrary to her own. The season had been
      <pb n="629"/> spent in the same whirl that had, last year, been almost beyond human power,
      even when stimulated by enjoyment and success; and now, when her spirits were lowered, and her
      health weakened, Meta had watched and trembled for her, though never able to obtain an avowal
      that it was an overstrain, and while treated most affectionately, never admitted within her
      barrier of reserve.</p>
     <p>'If I could see poor Flora comforted, or if even she would only let me enter into her
      troubles,' Margaret said, sighing, 'I should be content.'</p>
     <p>The Consecration day came near, and the travellers began to return. Meta was in a state of
      restlessness, which in her was very pretty, under the disguise of a great desire to be useful.
      She fluttered about the house, visited Margaret, played with Gertrude, set the drawing-room
      ornaments to rights—a task which Ethel was very glad to depute to her, and made a great many
      expeditions into the garden to put together autumn nosegays for the vases—finally discovering
      that Ethel's potichomanie vases on the staircase window, must have some red and brown
      leaves.</p>
     <p>She did not come back quite so soon with them, and Mrs. Arnott, slyly looking out of window,
      reported, 'Ha! he is come then! At least, I see the little thing has found—'</p>
     <p>'Something extremely unlike itself,' said Dr. May, laughing.</p>
     <p>'Something I could easily set down as a student at Edinburgh, thirty years ago. That's the
      very smile! I remember dear Maggie being more angry than I ever saw her before, because Mr.
      Fleet said that you smiled to shew your white teeth.'</p>
     <p>'That is the best shadow of Maggie I ever saw,' said Dr. May. 'She has taught the lad to
      smile. That is what I call a pretty sight!'</p>
     <p>'Come, Richard, it is a shame for old folks like us to stand spying them!'</p>
     <p>'They care very little for me,' said Dr. May, 'but I shall have them in. Cold winds blowing
      about that little head! Ah! here they are. Fine leaves you gather, Miss! Very red and
      brown.'</p>
     <p>Meta rather liked, than otherwise, those pretty teazings of Dr. May, but they always made
      Norman colour extremely, and he parried them by announcing news. 'No, not the Bucephalus, a
      marriage in high life, a relation.'</p>
     <p>'Not poor Mary!' cried Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Mary! what could make you think of her?'</p>
     <p>'As a hen thinks of her ducklings when they go into waters beyond her ken,' said Ethel.
      'Well, as long as it is not Mary, I don't care!'</p>
     <pb n="630"/>
     <p>'High life!' repeated Meta. 'O, it can be only Agatha Langdale.'</p>
     <p>'There's only Lord Cosham further to guess,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Eh! why not young Ogilvie?' said Dr. May. 'I am right, I see. Well, who is the lady?'</p>
     <p>'A Miss Dunbar—a nice girl that I met at Glenbracken. Her property fits in with theirs, and
      I believe his father has been wishing it for a long time.'</p>
     <p>'It does not sound too romantic,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'He writes as if he had the sense of having been extremely dutiful,' said Norman.</p>
     <p>'No doubt, thinking it needful in addressing a namesake, who <hi>has</hi> had an eye to the
      main chance,' said the Doctor. 'Don't throw stones, young people.'</p>
     <p>'Well!' exclaimed Meta; 'he did not look as if he would go and do such a stupid thing as
      that!'</p>
     <p>'Probably, it is anything but a stupid thing,' said Dr. May.</p>
     <p>'You are using him very ill among you,' said Norman, eagerly. 'I believe her to be excellent
      in every way; he has known her from childhood; he writes as if he were perfectly contented,
      and saw every chance of happiness.'</p>
     <p>'None the less for having followed his father's wishes—I am glad he did,' said Ethel, coming
      to her brother's side.</p>
     <p>'I dare say you are right,' was Meta's answer; 'but I am disappointed in him. He always
      promised to come and stay with you, and made such friends at Oxford, and he never came.'</p>
     <p>'I fancy there was a good deal to hinder him,' said Norman; and, as Mrs. Arnott proceeded to
      inquiries after the Ogilvies in general, the Master of Glenbracken was allowed to drop.</p>
     <p>Meta, however, renewed the subject when walking to the Minster that evening with Norman.</p>
     <p>'You may defend Mr. Ogilvie, Norman, but it is not what I should have expected from him. Why
      did he make promises, and then neglect his relations?'</p>
     <p>'I believe that conscientiously he did not dare to come,' said Norman. 'I know that he was
      greatly struck with Ethel at the time of the Commemoration, and therefore I could never again
      press him to come here.'</p>
     <p>'O Norman, you hard-hearted monster! What a bad conductor!'</p>
     <p>'I did not wish to be a conductor,' said Norman. 'If you had seen Glenbracken and the old
      people, you would perceive that it would not have been suitable on our part to promote
      anything of the kind.'</p>
     <p>'Would they have been so violent?'</p>
     <pb n="631"/>
     <p>'Not violent, but it would have been a severe struggle. They are good, kind people, but with
      strong prejudices; and, though I have no doubt they would have yielded to steady attachment on
      their son's part, and such conduct as Ethel's would have been, I could not lead in that
      direction.'</p>
     <p>'Is that pride, Norman?'</p>
     <p>'I hope not.'</p>
     <p>'It is doing by others as you were doing by yourself,' half-whispered Meta; 'but, after all,
      if he had no constancy, Ethel had an escape.'</p>
     <p>'I was afraid that she had been rather touched, but I am glad to find myself mistaken.'</p>
     <p>'If you thought so, how could you make such a public announcement?'</p>
     <p>He laughed. 'I had made myself so nervous as to the effect, that, in desperation, I took her
      own way, and came out at once with it as unconsciously as I could.'</p>
     <p>'Very naturally you acted unconsciousness! It was better than insulting her by seeming to
      condole. Not that I do, though, for she deserves more steadiness than he has shown! If a man
      could appreciate her at all, I should have thought that it would have been once and for
      ever.'</p>
     <p>'Remember, he had barely known her a fortnight, and probably had no reason to believe that
      he had made any impression on her. He knew how such an attachment would grieve his parents,
      and, surely, he was acting dutifully, and with selfdenial and consideration, in not putting
      himself in the way of being further attracted.'</p>
     <p>'Umph! You make a good defence, Norman, but I cannot forgive him for marrying somebody else,
      who cannot be Ethel's equal.'</p>
     <p>'She is a good little girl; he will form her, and be very happy; perhaps more so than with a
      great soul and strong nature, like Ethel's.'</p>
     <p>'Only he is a canny Scot, and not a Dr. Spencer!'</p>
     <p>'Too short acquaintance! besides, there were the parents. Moreover, what would become of
      home without Ethel?'</p>
     <p>'The unanswerable argument to make one contented,' said Meta. And, certainly, to be wife to
      a Member of Parliament, is not so very delightful that one would covet it for her.'</p>
     <p>'Any more than she does for herself.'</p>
     <p>Norman was right in his view of his friends motives, as well as of Ethel's present feelings.
      If there had ever been any disappointment about Norman Ogilvie, it had long since faded away.
      She had never given away the depths of her heart, though the upper surface had been stirred.
      All had long subsided, and she could
      <pb n="632"/> think freely of him as an agreeable cousin, in whose brilliant public career she
      should always be interested, without either a wish to partake it, or a sense of injury or
      neglect. She had her vocation, in her father, Margaret, the children, home and Cocksmoor; her
      mind and affections were occupied, and she never thought of wishing herself elsewhere.</p>
     <p>The new Church and the expected return of her sisters, engrossed many more of her thoughts
      than did anything relating to Glenbracken.</p>
     <p>She could not bear to talk of Flora, though almost as uneasy as was Margaret; and not able
      to lay aside misgivings, lest even her good simple Mary might have had her head turned by
      gaiety.</p>
     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Rivers arrived on the Saturday before the Tuesday fixed for the Consecration,
      and stopped on their way, that they might see Margaret, deposit Mary, and resume Meta.</p>
     <p>It was a short visit, and all that Ethel could discover was, that Flora was looking very
      ill, no longer able to conceal the worn and fagged expression of her countenance, and
      evidently dreadfully shocked by the sight of the havoc made by disease on Margaret's frame.
      Yet she talked with composure of indifferent subjects—the yacht, the visits, the Bucephalus,
      the Church, and the arrangements for St. Andrew's day. She owned herself overworked, and in
      need of rest, and, as she was not well enough to venture on being present at the Consecration,
      she undertook to spend the day with Margaret, thus setting the others at liberty. This
      settled, she took her leave, for the journey had fatigued her greatly.</p>
     <p>During the short visit, Mary had moved and spoken so quietly, and looked so well-dressed,
      and young-lady-like, that, in spite of her comfortable plump cheeks, Ethel felt quite
      afraid!</p>
     <p>But the instant the carriage had driven off, there was a skipping, a hugging, a screaming,
      'O, it is so nice to be at home again!'—and Ethel knew she had her own Mary. It was only a
      much better looking and more mannerly Mary, in the full bloom of seventeen, open and
      honest-faced, her profuse light hair prettily disposed, her hands and arms more civilized, and
      her powers of conversation and self-possession developed. Mary-like were her caresses of
      Gertrude, Mary-like her inquiries for Cocksmoor, Mary-like her insisting on bringing her boxes
      into Margaret's room, her exulting exhibition of all the pretty things that Flora and George
      had given to her, and the still more joyous bestowal of presents upon everybody.</p>
     <p>Her tastes were not a whit altered, nor her simplicity diminished. If she was pleased by
      joining a large dinner-party, her satisfaction was in the amusement of seeing well-dressed
      people, and a grand
      <pb n="633"/> table; her knowledge of the world only reached to pronouncing everything unlike
      home, "so funny;" she had relished most freshly and innocently every pleasure that she could
      understand, she had learnt every variety of fancy work to teach Blanche and Miss Bracy, had
      been the delight of every school-room and nursery, had struck up numberless eternal
      friendships and correspondences with girls younger and shyer than herself, and her chief
      vexations seemed to have been first, that Flora insisted on her being called Miss May,
      secondly, that all her delights could not be shared by everyone at home, and thirdly, that
      poor Flora could not bear to look at little children.</p>
     <p>Grievous complaints were preferred by the dwellers in the attics the next morning, that Mary
      and Blanche had talked to an unmentionable hour of the night; but, on the whole, Blanche was
      rather doubtful whether Mary had made the most of her opportunities of observation.</p>

     <p>The thirtieth of November dawned with the grave brightness of an autumn day, as the
      sun slowly mounted from the golden east, drinking up the mists that rose tardily, leaving the
      grass thickly bedewed.</p>
     <p>The bells of Stoneborough Minster were ringing gladsome peals, and the sunshine had newly
      touched the lime trees, whose last bright yellow leaves were gently floating down, as the
      carriage, from the Grange, drew up at Dr. May's door.</p>
     <p>Norman opened it, to claim Meta at once for the walk; Mrs. Arnott and Mary had gone on to
      assist Richard in his final
      <pb n="634"/> arrangements, but even before Cocksmoor, with Ethel, was now the care of
      Margaret; and she had waited with her father to keep all bustle from her room, and to commit
      her into the charge of Flora and of nurse. Ethel seemed quite unwilling to go. There was that
      strange oppressed feeling on her as if the attainment of her wishes were joy too great to be
      real—as if she would fain hold off from it at the climax, and linger with the sister who had
      shared all with her, and to whom that Church was even more than to herself. She came back, and
      back again, with fresh injunctions, sometimes forgetting the very purpose of her return, as if
      it had been only an excuse for looking at Margaret's countenance, and drinking in her sympathy
      from her face; but she was to go in George's carriage, and he was not a man to allow of
      loitering. He became so impatient of Ethel's delays, that she perceived that he could bear
      them no longer, gave her final kiss, and whispered, 'In spirit with us!' then ran down and was
      siezed on by George, who had already packed in the children and Miss Bracy, and was whirled
      away.</p>
     <p>'Flora dear,' said Margaret, 'do you dislike having the window opened?'</p>
     <p>Flora threw it up, protesting, in reply to her sister's scruples, that she liked the air.
      'You always spoilt me,' said Margaret, fondly. 'Come and lie down by me. It is very nice to
      have you here,' she added, as Flora complied; and she took her hand and fondled it. 'It is
      like the old times to have you here taking care of me.'</p>
     <p>'Very unlike them in some ways,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'It has been a great renewal of still older times,' said Margaret, 'to have aunt Flora here.
      I hope you will get to know her, Flora, it is so like having mamma here,' and she looked in
      her sister's face as she spoke.</p>
     <p>Flora did not reply, but she lay quite still, as if there were a charm in the perfect rest
      of being alone with Margaret, making no effort, and being able to be silent. Time passed on,
      how long they knew not, but, suddenly, a thrill shot through Margaret's frame; she raised her
      hand and lifted her head, with an eager 'Hark!'</p>
     <p>Flora could hear nothing.</p>
     <p>'The bells—his bells!' said Margaret, all one radiant look of listening, as Flora opened the
      window further, and the breeze wafted in the chime, softened by distance. The carnation tinted
      those thin white cheeks, eyes and smile beamed with joy, and uplifted finger and parted lips
      seemed marking every note of the cadence.</p>
     <p>It ceased. 'Alan! Alan!' said she. 'It is enough! I am ready!'</p>
     <p>The somewhat alarmed look on Flora's face recalled her, and,
      <pb n="635"/> smiling, she held out her hand for the Consecration books, saying, 'Let us
      follow the service. It will be best for us both.'</p>
     <p>Slowly, softly, and rather monotonously, Flora read on, till she had come more than half
      through the first Lesson. Her voice grew husky, and she sometimes paused as if she could not
      easily proceed. Margaret begged her to stop, but she would not cease, and went on reading,
      though almost whispering, till she came to, "If they return to Thee with all their heart and
      with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives,
      and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the City which
      Thou hast chosen, and toward the House which I have built for Thy Name; then hear Thou from
      the Heavens, even from Thy dwelling-place—"</p>
     <p>Flora could go no further; she strove, but one of her tearless sobs cut her short. She
      turned her face aside, and, as Margaret began to say something tender, she exclaimed, with
      low, hasty utterance, 'Margaret! Margaret! pray for me! for it is a hard captivity, and my
      heart is very, very sore. Oh! pray for me, that it may all be forgiven me—and that I may see
      my child again!'</p>
     <p>'My Flora; my own poor, dear Flora! do I not pray? Oh! look up, look up. Think how He loves
      you. If I love you so much, how much more does not He? Come near me, Flora. Be patient, and I
       <hi>know</hi> peace will come!'</p>
     <p>The words had burst from Flora uncontrollably. She was aware, the next instant, that she had
      given way to harmful agitation, and, resuming her quiescence, partly by her own will, partly
      from the soothing effect of Margaret's words and tone, she allowed herself to be drawn close
      to her sister, and hid her face in the pillow, while Margaret's hands were folded over her,
      and words of blessing and prayer were whispered with a fervency that made them broken.</p>
     <p>Ethel, meanwhile, stood between Aubrey and Gertrude, hardly able to believe it was not a
      dream, as she beheld the procession enter the Aisle, and heard the Psalm that called on those
      doors to lift up their heads for Him who should enter. There was an almost bewildered
      feeling—could it indeed be true, as she followed the earlier part of the service, which set
      apart that building as a Temple for ever, separate from all common uses. She had imagined the
      scene so often that she could almost have supposed the present, one of her many imaginations;
      but, by-and-by, the strangeness passed off, and she was able to enter into, not merely to
      follow, the prayers, and to feel the deep thanksgiving that such had been the crown of her
      feeble efforts. Margaret was in her mind the whole time, woven, as it were, into every
      supplication and every note of praise; and when there came the intercession for those in
      sickness and suffering,
      <pb n="636"/> flowing into the commemoration of those departed in faith and fear, Ethel's
      spirit sank for a moment at the conviction, that soon Margaret, like him, whom all must bear
      in mind on that day, might be included in that thanksgiving; yet, as the service proceeded,
      leaving more and more of earth behind, and the voices joined with Angel and Archangel, Ethel
      could lose the present grief, and only retain the certainty that, come what might, there was
      joy and union amid those who sung that Hymn of praise. Never had Ethel been so happy— not in
      the sense of the finished work—no, she had lost all that, but in being more carried out of
      herself than ever she had been before, the free spirit of praise so bearing up her heart that
      the cry of Glory came from her with such an exulting gladness, as might surely be reckoned as
      one of those foretastes of our Everlasting Life, not often vouchsafed even to the faithful,
      and usually sent to prepare strength for what may be in store.</p>
     <p>The blessing brought the sense of peace, which hung on her even while the sounds of movement
      began, and the congregation were emerging. As she came out, greetings, sentences of admiration
      of the Church, and of enquiry for her absent sisters, were crowded upon her, as people moved
      towards the school, where a luncheon was provided for them, to pass away the interval until
      evening service. The half-dozen oldest Cocksmoorites were, meantime, to have a dinner in the
      former school-room, at the Elwood's house, and Ethel was anxious to see that all was right
      there, so, while the rest of her party were doing civil things, she gave her arm to Cherry,
      whose limping walk shewed her to be very tired.</p>
     <p>'Oh! Miss Ethel!' said Cherry, 'if Miss May could only have been here!'</p>
     <p>'Her heart is,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Well, ma'am, I believe it is. You would not think, ma'am, how all the children take heed to
      anything about her. If I only begin to say "Miss May told me—" they are all like mice.'</p>
     <p>'She has done more for the real good of Cocksmoor than anyone else,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>More might have been said, but they perceived that they were being overtaken by the body of
      Clergy, who had been unrobing in the vestry. Ethel hastened to retreat within Mrs. Elwood's
      wicket gate, but she was arrested by Richard, and found herself being presented to the Bishop,
      and the Bishop shaking hands with her, and saying that he had much wished to be introduced to
      her.</p>
     <p>Of course, that was because she was her father's daughter, and by way of-something to say.
      She mentioned what was going on at the cottage, whereupon the Bishop wished to go in and see
      the old people; and, entering, they found the very comfortable-looking party
      <pb n="637"/> just sitting down to roast-beef and goose. John Taylor, in a new black coat, on
      account of his Clerkship, presiding at one end, and Mr. Elwood at the other, and Dame Hall
      finding conversation for the whole assembly; while Blanche, Aubrey, Gertrude, the little
      Larkinses, and the Abbotstoke Wilmots were ready to act as waiters with infinite delight. Not
      a whit daunted by the Bishop, who was much entertained by her merry manner, old Granny told
      him 'she had never seen nothing like it since the Jubilee, when the Squire roasted an ox
      whole, and there wasn't none of it fit to eat; and when her poor father got his head broken.
      Well, to be sure, who would have thought what would come of Sam's bringing in the young
      gentleman and lady to see her the day her back was so bad!'</p>
     <p>The Bishop said Grace, and left Granny to the goose, while he gave Ethel his arm, which she
      would have thought an unaccountable proceeding if she had not recollected that Richard might
      be considered as host, and that she was his eldest sister forthcoming.</p>
     <p>No sooner, however, had they come beyond the wicket than she saw her father speaking to Will
      Adams, and there was that in the air of both which made it no surprise when Dr. May came up,
      saying, 'Ethel, I must carry you away;' and, in explanation to the Bishop, 'my poor girl at
      home is not so well.'</p>
     <p>All was enquiry and sympathy. Ethel was frantic to be at home, and would have rushed off at
      once, if Richard had not held her fast, asking what good she would do by hurrying in,
      breathless and exhausted, so as to add to Flora's fright and distress, the anxiety which was
      most upon their minds, since she had never before witnessed one of the seizures, that were
      only too ordinary matters in the eyes of the home party. No one but Dr. May and Ethel should
      go. Richard undertook to tell the rest, and the gig making its appearance, Ethel felt that the
      peculiarly kind manner with which the Bishop pressed her hand, and gave them all good wishes,
      was like a continuation of his blessing to aid her, in her home scene of trial.</p>
     <p>Perhaps, it was well for her that her part in the Consecration festivities should end here;
      at least so thought Mr. Wilmot, who, though very sorry for the cause, could not wish her to
      have been present at the luncheon. She had not thought of self hitherto, the Church was the
      gift of Alan and Margaret, the work of preparing the people belonged to all alike, and she did
      not guess that, in the sight of others, she was not the nobody that she believed herself. Her
      share in the work at Cocksmoor was pretty well known, and Dr. Hoxton could not allow a public
      occasion to pass without speeches, such as must either have been very painful, or very hurtful
      to her. The absence of herself and her father, however, permitted a more free utterance to the
      general feeling; and things were said,
      <pb n="638"/> that did indeed make the rest of the family extremely hot and uncomfortable, but
      which gave them extreme pleasure. Norman was obliged to spare Richard the answer, and said
      exactly what he ought, and so beautifully, that Meta could not find it in her heart to echo
      the fervent wish, which he whispered as he sat down, that speechifying could be abolished by
      act of parliament.</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott began to perceive that her nephew was something to be proud of, and to
      understand how much was sacrificed, while George Rivers expressed his opinion to her that
      Norman would be a crack speaker in the House, and he hoped she would say everything to hinder
      his going out, for it was a regular shame to waste him on the niggers.</p>
     <p>Owing to George having constituted himself her squire, Mrs. Arnott had not arrived at an
      understanding of the state of affairs at home; but, as soon they rose up from luncheon, and
      she learnt the truth from Richard and Mary, nothing would hinder her from walking home at once
      to see whether she could be useful. Mary was easily persuaded to remain, for she was
      accustomed to Margaret's having these attacks, and had always been kept out of her room the
      while, so she had little uneasiness to prevent her from being very happy, in receiving in her
      own simple, good-humoured way, all the attentions that lapsed upon her in the place of her
      elder sisters.</p>
     <p>'Cocksmoor really has a Church!' was note enough of joy for her, and no one could look at
      her round face without seeing perfect happiness. Moreover, when after evening service, the
      November mist turned into decided rain, she was as happy as a queen in her foresight, which
      had provided what seemed an unlimited supply of cloaks and umbrellas. She appeared to have an
      original genius for making the right people give a lift in their carriages to the distressed;
      and, regarding the Abbotstoke britska as her own, packed in Mrs. Anderson and Fanny, in
      addition to all their own little ones, Meta thrusting Miss Bracy into the demi-corner destined
      for herself at the last minute, and, remaining with Mary, the only ladies obliged to walk back
      to Stoneborough. So delighted were they "at the fun," that it might have been thought the most
      charming of adventures, and they laughed all the more at the lack of umbrellas. They went to
      Mrs. Elwood's, divested themselves of all possible finery, and tucked up the rest; Meta was
      rolled up from head to foot in a great old plaid shawl of Mrs. Elwood's, and Mary had a cloak
      of Richard's, the one took Norman's arm, the other Dr. Spencer's, and they trudged home
      through the darkness and the mud in the highest glee, quite sorry when the carriage met them
      half-way.</p>
     <p>It was the last mirth that they enjoyed for many weeks. When they reached home, a sense of
      self-reproach for their glee thrilled
      <pb n="639"/> over them, when they found a sort of hush pervading the drawing-room, and saw
      the faces of awe and consternation, worn by Blanche and George Rivers.</p>
     <p>'It was a much worse attack than usual, and it did not go off,' was all that Blanche knew,
      but her father had desired to be told when Dr. Spencer came home, and she went up with the
      tidings.</p>
     <p>This brought Flora down, looking dreadfully pale, and with her voice sunk away as it had
      been when she lost her child. Her husband started up, exclaiming at her aspect; she let him
      support her to the sofa, and gave the few particulars. Margaret had been as placid and
      comfortable as usual, till nurse came to dress her, but the first move had brought on the
      faintness and loss of breath. It did not yield to remedies, and she had neither looked nor
      spoken since, only moaned. Flora thought her father much alarmed; and then, after an interval,
      she began to entreat that they might stay there, sending Miss Bracy and the children to the
      Grange to make room.</p>
     <p>Meantime, Dr. Spencer had come to the sick room, but he could only suggest remedies that
      were already in course of application to the insensible sufferer. Mrs. Arnott and Ethel were
      watching, and trying everything to relieve her, but with little effect, and Ethel presently
      stood by the fire with her father, as Dr. Spencer turned towards him, and he said, in a very
      low, but calm voice, 'It won't do—I believe it is the death-stroke.'</p>
     <p>'Not immediate,' said Dr. Spencer.</p>
     <p>'No,' said Dr. May; and he quietly spoke of what the disease had effected, and what yet
      remained for it to do, ere the silver bowl should be broken.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer put in a word of agreement.</p>
     <p>'Will there be no rally?' said Ethel, in the same tone.</p>
     <p>'Probably not,' said Dr. May; 'the brain is generally reached at this stage. I have seen it
      coming for a long time. The thing was done seven years ago. There was a rally for a time when
      youth was strong; but suspense and sorrow accelerated what began from the injury to the
      spine.'</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer bowed his head, and looked at him anxiously, saying, 'I do not think there will
      be much acute suffering.'</p>
     <p>'I fear it may be as trying,' said Dr. May, sighing; and then turning to Ethel, and throwing
      his arm round her, 'May God make it easy to her, and grant us "patient hearts." We will not
      grudge her to all that she loves best, my Ethel.'</p>
     <p>Ethel clung to him, as if to derive strength from him. But the strength that was in them
      then, did not come from earth. Dr. Spencer wrung his hand, and stepped back to the bed to try
      <pb n="640"/> another resource. Vain again, they only seemed to be tormenting her, and the
      silent helplessness prevailed again. Then Dr. May went down to Flora, told her the true state
      of the case, and urged on her to give up her plan of remaining. George joined with him, and
      she yielded submissively, but would not be refused going up once again and kissing her sister,
      standing beside her gazing at her, till her father came softly and drew her away. 'I shall be
      here to-morrow,' she said to Ethel, and went.</p>
     <p>The morrow, however, brought no Flora. The agitation and distress of thst day had broken her
      down completely, and she was so ill as to be unable to move. Her aunt went at once to see her,
      and finding that her presence at the Grange relieved some of Dr. May's anxieties, chiefly
      devoted herself to her. Flora was grateful and gentle, but as silent and impenetrable as ever,
      while day after day she lay on her couch, uncomplaining and undemonstrative, visited by her
      father, and watched over by her aunt and sister-in-law, who began to know each other much
      better, though Flora less than ever, in that deep fixed grief. She only roused herself to
      return her husband's affection, or to listen to the daily reports of Margaret. Poor George, he
      was very forlorn, thugh Meta did her best to wait on him, and he rode over twice a day to
      inquire at Stoneborough.</p>
     <p>The Doctors were right, and the Consecration morning was her last of full consciousness.
      From the hour when she had heard the sound of Alan's bells, her ears were closed to earthly
      sounds. There was very little power of intercourse with her, as she lingered on the borders of
      the Land very far away, where skill and tenderness could not either reach body or spirit.
      Often the watchers could not tell whether she was conscious, or only incapacitated from
      expression, by the fearful weight on her breath, which caused a restlessness most piteous in
      the exhausted helpless frame, wasted till the softest touch was anguish. Now and then came
      precious gleams when a familiar voice, or some momentary alleviation would gain a smile, or
      thanks, and they thought her less restless when Richard read prayers beside her, but words
      were very rare, only now and then a name, and when in most distress, "it will be soon over,"
      "it will soon be over," occurred so often, that they began to think it once her solace, and
      now repeated habitually without a meaning.</p>
     <p>They could not follow her into the valley of the shadow of death, but could only watch the
      frail earthly prison-house being broken down, as if the doom of sin must be borne, though
      faith could trust that it was but her full share in the Cross. Calmly did those days pass.
      Ethel, Richard, and Mary divided between them the watching and the household cares, and their
      father bore up bravely in the fullness
      <pb n="641"/> of his love and faith, resigning his daughter to the Hands which were bearing
      her whither her joys had long since departed.</p>
     <p>Hector Ernescliffe arrived when the holidays began; and his agony of sorrow, when she failed
      to recognise him, moved Dr. May to exert himself earnestly for his consolation; and, at the
      same time, Tom, in a gentle, almost humble manner, paid a sort of daughter-like attention to
      the smallest services for his father, as if already accepting him as his especial charge.</p>
     <p>It was midnight, on the longest night of the year; Ethel was lying on her bed, and had
      fallen into a brief slumber, when her father's low, clear voice summoned her: 'Ethel, she is
      going!'</p>
     <p>There was a change on the face, and the breath came in labouring gasps. Richard lifted her
      head, and her eyes once more opened; she smiled once more.</p>
     <p>'Papa!' she said, 'dear papa!'</p>
     <p>He threw himself on his knees beside her, but she looked beyond him, 'Mamma! Alan! oh! there
      they are! More! more!' and, as though the unspeakable dawned on her, she gasped for utterance,
      then looked, with a consoling smile, on her father. 'Over now!' she said—and the last struggle
      was ended. That which Richard laid down was no longer Margaret May.</p>
     <p>Over now! The twenty-five years' life, the seven years' captivity on her couch, the anxious
      headship of the motherless household, the hopeless betrothal, the long suspense, the efforts
      for resignation, the widowed affections, the slow decay, the tardy, painful death agony—all
      was over; nothing left, save what they had rendered the undying spirit, and the impress her
      example had left on those around her.</p>
     <p>The long continuance of the last suffering had softened the actual parting; and it was with
      thankfulness for the cessation of her pain that they turned away, and bade each other
      good-night.</p>
     <p>Ethel would not have believed that her first wakening, to the knowledge that Margaret was
      gone, could have been more fraught with relief than with misery. And, for her father, it
      seemed as if it were a home-like, comfortable thought to him, that her mother had one of her
      children with her. He called her the first link of his Daisy Chain drawn up out of sight; and,
      during the quiet days that ensued, he seemed as it were to be lifted above grief, dwelling
      upon hope. His calmness impressed the same on his children, as they moved about in the solemn
      stillness of the house; and when Harry, pale, and shocked at the blow to him so sudden, came
      home, the grave silence soothed his violence of grief; and he sat beside his father or Mary,
      speaking in under-tones of what Margaret had loved to hear from him, of Alan Ernescliffe's
      last moments.</p>
     <pb n="642"/>
     <p>Mary gave way to a burst of weeping when she sought, in vain, for Daisies in the wintry
      garden; but Hector Ernescliffe went down to the Cloisters, and brought back the lingering
      blossoms to be placed on Margaret's bosom.</p>
     <p>The dog Toby had followed him, unseen, to the cloister; and he was entering the garden, when
      he was struck by seeing the animal bounding, in irrepressible ecstacy, round a lad, whose
      tarpaulin hat, blue bordered collar, and dark blue dress, shewed him to be a sailor, as well
      as the broad-shouldered, grizzled, elderly man, who stood beside him.</p>
     <p>'I say, sir,' said the latter, as Hector's hand was on the door, 'do you belong to Dr.
      May?'</p>
     <p>Hector unhesitatingly answered that he did.</p>
     <p>'Then, may be, sir, you have heard of one Bill Jennings.'</p>
     <p>Hector was all in one flush, almost choking, as he told that he was Mr. Ernescliffe's
      brother, and gave his hand to the sailor. 'What could he do for him?'</p>
     <p>Jennings had heard from one of the crew of the Bucephalus that Mr. May had been met, on his
      return to Portsmouth, by the news of his sister's death. The Mays had helped his boy; he had
      been with Mr. May in the island; he had laid Mr. Ernescliffe in his grave; and some notion had
      crossed the sailor that he must be at Miss Margaret's funeral—it might be they would let him
      lend a hand—and, in this expedition, he was spending his time on shore.</p>
     <p>How he was welcomed need not be told, nor how the tears came forth from full hearts, as Dr.
      May granted his wish, and thanked him for doing what Margaret herself would indeed have
      chosen; and, in his blue sailor garb, was Jennings added to the bearers, their own men, and
      two Cocksmoor labourers, who, early on Christmas Eve, carried her to the Minster. Last time
      she had been there, Alan Ernescliffe had supported her. Now, what was mortal of him lay
      beneath the palm tree, beneath the glowing summer sky, while the first snow flakes hung like
      pearls on her pall. But, as they laid her by her mother's side, who could doubt that they were
      together?</p>

     <p>Late in the evening of the same snowy 24th of December, a little daughter awoke to
      life at Abbotstoke Grange, and, not long after, Mrs. Arnott came to summon Dr. May from the
      anxious vigil in the sitting room.</p>
     <p>'Come and see if you can do anything to soothe her,' she said, with much alarm. 'The first
      sight of the baby has put her into such a state of agitation, that we do not know what to do
      with her.'</p>
     <p>It was so, when he came to her bedside; that fixed stony look of despair was gone; the
      source of tears, so long dried up, had opened again; and there she lay, weeping quietly
      indeed, but profusely, and with deep heaving sobs. To speak, or to leave her alone, seemed
      equally perilous, but he chose the first—he kissed and blessed her, and gave her joy. She
      looked up at him as if his blessing once more brought peace, and said, faintly, 'Now it is
      pardon—now I can die!'</p>
     <p>'The cloud is gone! Thanks for that above all!' said Dr. May, fervently. 'Now, my dear, rest
      in thankful gladness—you are too weak to talk or think.'</p>
     <p>'I am weak—I am tired of it all,' said Flora. 'I am glad to be going while I am so
      happy—there are Margaret—my own darling— rest—peace—'</p>
     <p>'You are not going, dearest,' said her father; 'at least, I trust not, if you will not give
      way—here is a darling given to you, instead of the first, who needs you more.'</p>
     <p>He would have taken the infant from the nurse and held her to her mother, but, recollecting
      how little Leonora had drawn her last breath in his arms, he feared the association, and
      signed to Mrs. Arnott to shew her the child; but she seemed as yet only able to feel that
      <pb n="644"/> it was not Leonora, and the long sealed-up grief would have its way. The tears
      burst out again. 'Tell Ethel she will be the best mother to her. Name her Margaret—make her a
      Daisy of your own—don't call her after me,' she said, with such passionate caresses, that Mrs.
      Arnott was glad to take the babe away.</p>
     <p>Dr. May's next expedient was to speak to her of her husband, who needed her more than all,
      and to call him in. There seemed to be something tranquillizing in his wistful manner of
      repeating, 'Don't cry, Flora;' and she was at last reduced, by her extreme exhaustion, to
      stillness; but there were still many fears for her.</p>
     <p>Dr. May's prediction was accomplished—that she would suffer for having over-exerted herself.
      Her constitution had been severely tried by the grief and despondency that she had so long
      endured in silence, and the fresh sorrow for her favorite sister, coming at such a crisis.
      There was a weariness of life, and an unwillingness to resume her ordinary routine, that made
      her almost welcome her weakness and sinking; and now that the black terror had cleared away
      from the future, she seemed to long to follow Margaret at once, and to yearn after her lost
      child; while appeals to the affection that surrounded her, often seemed to oppress her, as if
      there were nothing but weariness and toil in store.</p>
     <p>The state of her mind made her father very anxious, though it was but too well accounted
      for. Poor Flora had voluntarily assumed the trammels that galled her; worldly motives had
      prompted her marriage, and though she faithfully loved her husband, he was a heavy weight on
      her hands, and she had made it more onerous by thrusting him into a position for which he was
      not calculated, and inspriring him with a self-consequence that would not recede from it. The
      shock of her child's death had taken away the zest and energy which had rejoiced in her chosen
      way of life, and opened her eyes to see what Master she had been serving; and the perception
      of the hollowness of all that had been apparently good in her, had filled her with remorse and
      despair. Her sufferings had been the more bitter because she had not parted with her proud
      reserve. She had refused council, and denied her confidence to those who could have guided her
      repentance. Her natural good sense, and the sound principle in which she had been brought up,
      had taught her to distrust her gloomy feelings as possibly morbid; and she had prayed, keeping
      her hold of faith in the Infinite Mercy, though she could not feel her own part in it; and
      thus that faith was beginning at last to clear her path.</p>
     <p>It was the harder to deal with her, because her hysterical agitation was so easily excited,
      that her father hardly dared to let a word be
      <pb n="645"/> spoken to her; and she was allowed to see no one else except her aunt and the
      dear old nurse, whose tears for her child Margaret had been checked by the urgent requirements
      of another of her nurslings; and whom George Rivers would have paid with her weight in gold,
      for taking care of his new daughter, regarding her as the only woman in the world that could
      be trusted.</p>
     <p>Those were heavy days with everyone, though each brought some shade of improvement. They
      were harder to bear than the peaceful days that had immediately followed the loss of Margaret;
      and Ethel was especially unhappy and forlorn under the new anxiety, where she could be of no
      service; and with her precious occupation gone; her father absent, instead of resting upon
      her; and her room deserted. She was grieved with herself, because her feelings were unable to
      soar at the Christmas feast, as erst on St. Andrew's day; and she was bewildered and
      distressed by the fear that she had then been only uplifted by vanity and elation.</p>
     <p>She told Richard so, and he said, kindly, that he thought a good deal of what she complained
      of arose from bodily weariness.</p>
     <p>This hurt her a little; but when he said, 'I think that the blessings of St. Andrew's day
      helped us through what was to follow,' she owned that it had indeed been so, and added, 'I am
      going to work again! Tell me what will be most useful to you at Cocksmoor.'</p>
     <p>Sick at heart as she was, she bravely set herself to appropriate the hours now left vacant;
      and manfully walked with Richard and Harry to Church at Cocksmoor, on St. Stephen's day; but
      the Church brought back the sense of contrast. Next, she insisted on fulfilling their
      intention of coming home by Abbotstoke to hear how Flora was, when the unfavorable account
      only added lead to the burthen that weighted her down. Though they were sent home in the
      carriage, she was so completely spent, that the effect of returning home to her room, without
      its dear inhabitant, was quite overwhelming, and she sat on her bed for half-an-hour,
      struggling with repinings. She came down-stairs without having gained the victory, and was so
      physically overcome with lassitude, that Richard insisted on her lying on the sofa, and
      leaving everything to him and Mary.</p>
     <p>Richard seemed to make her his object in life, and was an unspeakable help and comforter to
      her, not only by taking every care for her for <hi>her</hi> sake, but by turning to her as his
      own friend and confidante, the best able to replace what they had lost. There were many plans
      to be put in operation for Cocksmoor, on which much consultation was needed, though every word
      reminded them sadly of Margaret's ever ready interest in those schemes. It was
      <pb n="646"/> very unlike Ethel's vision of the first weeks of St. Andrew's Church; but it
      might be safer for her than that aught should tempt her to say, 'See what my perseverance has
      wrought!' Perhaps her Margaret had begun to admire her too much to be her safest confidante—at
      any rate, it was good still to sow in tears, rather than on earth to reap in confident
      joy.</p>
     <p>Norman was as brotherly and kind as possible; but it was one of the dreary feelings of those
      days, that Ethel then first became aware of the difference that his engagement had made, and
      saw that he resorted elsewhere for sympathy. She was not jealous, and acquiesced submissively
      and resolutely; but they had been so much to each other, that it was a trial, especially at
      such a time as this, when freshly deprived of Margaret.</p>
     <p>Norman's own prospect was not cheerful. He had received a letter from New Zealand, begging
      him to hasten his coming out, as there was educational work much wanting him, and, according
      to his original wish, he could be ordained there in the autumnal Ember week.</p>
     <p>He was in much perplexity, since, according to this request, he ought to sail with his aunt
      in the last week of February, and he knew not how to reconcile the conflicting claims.</p>
     <p>Meta was not long in finding out the whole of his trouble, as they paced up and down the
      terrace together, on a frosty afternoon.</p>
     <p>'You will go!' was her first exclamation.</p>
     <p>'I ought,' said Norman, 'I believe I ought, and if it had only been at any other time, it
      would have been easy. My aunt's company would have been such a comfort for you.'</p>
     <p>'It cannot be helped,' said Meta.</p>
     <p>'Considering the circumstances,' began Norman, with lingering looks at the little
      humming-bird on his arm, 'I believe I should be justified in waiting till such time as you
      could go with me. I could see what Mr. Wilmot thinks.'</p>
     <p>'You don't think so yourself,' said Meta. 'Nobody else can give a judgment. In a thing like
      this; asking is, what you once called, seeking opinions as Balaam enquired.'</p>
     <p>'Turning my words against me?' said Norman, smiling. 'Still, Meta, perhaps older heads would
      be fitter to judge what would be right for a little person not far off.'</p>
     <p>'She can be the best judge of that herself,' said Meta. 'Norman,' and her dark eyes were
      stedfastly fixed, 'I always resolved that, with God's help, I would not be a stumbling-block
      in the way of your call to your work. I will not. Go out now—perhaps you will be freer for it
      without me, and I suppose I have a longer
      <pb n="647"/> apprenticeship to serve to all sorts of things, before I come to help you.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Meta, you are a rebuke to me!'</p>
     <p>'What? when I am going to stay by my own fireside?' said Meta, trying to laugh, but not very
      successfully. 'Seriously, I have much to do here. When poor Flora gets well, she must be
      spared all exertion for a long time to come; and I flatter myself that they want me at
      Stoneborough sometimes. If your father can bear to spare you, there is no doubt that you ought
      to go.'</p>
     <p>'My father is as unselfish as you are, Meta— But I cannot speak to him until he is more easy
      about Flora. We always think the required sacrifice the hardest, but I must own that I could
      not grieve if he laid his commands on me to wait till the autumn.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! that would make it a duty and all easy,' said Meta, smiling; 'but I don't think he
      will, and aunt Flora will be only too glad to carry you out without encumbrance.'</p>
     <p>'Has not aunt Flora come to her senses about you?'</p>
     <p>'I believe she would rather I belonged to any of her nephews but you. She is such a dear,
      sincere, kindhearted person, and we are so comfortable together, that it will be quite like
      home to come out to her! I mean <hi>there</hi> , to convince her that I can be of something
      like use.'</p>
     <p>Meta talked so as to brighten and invigorate Norman when they were together, but they both
      grew low-spirited when apart. The humming-bird had hardly ever been so downcast as at
      present—that is, whenever she was not engaged in waiting on her brother, or in cheering up Dr.
      May, or in any of the many gentle offices that she was ever fulfilling. She was greatly
      disappointed, and full of fears for Norman, and dread of the separation, but she would not
      give way; and only now and then, when off her guard, would the sadness reign on her face
      without an effort. Alone, she fought and prayed for resignation for herself, and protection
      and strength for him, and chid herself for the foolish feeling that he would be safer with
      her.</p>
     <p>She told aunt Flora how it was one evening, as they sat over the fire together, speaking
      with a would-be-tone of congratulation.</p>
     <p>'Indeed! exclaimed Mrs. Arnott.' 'But that is a great pity!'</p>
     <p>Meta looked quite brightened by her saying so— 'I thought you would be glad,' she
      rejoined.</p>
     <p>'Did you think me so hard-hearted?'</p>
     <p>'I thought you believed he would be better without me.'</p>
     <p>'My dear, we have not kept house and nursed together for a month for nothing,' said Mrs.
      Arnott, smiling.</p>
     <pb n="648"/>
     <p>'Thank you,' said Meta, trying to answer the smile. 'You have taken a load off me!'</p>
     <p>'I don't like it at all,' said Mrs. Arnott. 'It is a very uncomfortable plan for everyone—
      And yet when I know how great is the want of him out there, I can say nothing against it
      without high treason. Well, my dear, I'll take all the care I can of Norman, and when you
      come—I shall be almost as glad as if we were coming home for good. Poor Flora, she is one
      person who will not regret the arrangement.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Flora—you think her really better this evening.'</p>
     <p>'Much better, indeed—if we could only raise her spirits, I think she would recover very
      well, but she is so sadly depressed. I must try to talk to Ethel—she may better understand
      her.'</p>
     <p>'I have never understood Flora,' said Meta. 'She has been as kind to me as possible, and I
      very soon came to a certain point with her, but I never have known her thoroughly. I doubt
      whether anyone did but dear Margaret.'</p>
     <p>Flora was, however, much softened and less reserved than she had been. She found great
      repose in her aunt's attendance, retracing, as it did her mother's presence, and she responded
      to her tenderness with increasing reliance and comfort; while as her strength began to revive,
      and there was more disposition to talk, she became gradually drawn into greater
      confidence.</p>
     <p>The seeing of Ethel was one of the difficult questions. Flora had begun to wish it very
      much, and yet the bare idea threw her into a nervous tremor, that caused it to be put off
      again and again. Her aunt found her one day almost faint with agitation—she had heard Ethel's
      voice in the next room, and had been winding up her expectations, and now was as much grieved
      as relieved, to find that she had been there seeing the baby, but was now gone.</p>
     <p>'How does the dear Ethel look?' asked Flora, presently.</p>
     <p>'She is looking better to-day; she has looked very worn and harassed, but I thought her
      brighter to-day. She walked over by Aubrey on his pony, and I think it did her good.'</p>
     <p>'Dear old Ethel! Aunt, it is a thing that no one has told me yet. Can you tell me how she
      bore the news of Norman Ogilvie's engagement?'</p>
     <p>'Do you mean—' and Mrs. Arnott stopped short in her interrogation.</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Flora, answering the pause.</p>
     <p>'But I thought young Ogilvie a most unexceptionable person.'</p>
     <p>'So he is,' said Flora. 'I was much annoyed at the time, but she was resolute."</p>
     <pb n="649"/>
     <p>'In rejecting him?'</p>
     <p>'In running away as soon as she found what was likely to happen;' and Flora, in a few words,
      told what had passed at Oxford.</p>
     <p>'Then it was entirely out of devotion to your father.'</p>
     <p>'Entirely,' said Flora. 'No one could look at her without seeing that she liked him. I had
      left her to be the only effective one at home, and she sacrificed herself.'</p>
     <p>'I am glad that I have seen her,' said Mrs. Arnott. 'I should never have understood her by
      description. I always said that I must come home to set my correspondence going rightly.'</p>
     <p>'Aunt Flora,' said her niece, 'do you remember my dear mother's unfinished letter to
      you?'</p>
     <p>'To be sure I do, my dear.'</p>
     <p>'Nothing ever was more true,' said Flora. 'I read it over some little time ago, when I set
      my papers in order, and understood it then. I never did before. I used to think it very good
      for the others.'</p>
     <p>'It is what one generally does with good advice.'</p>
     <p>'Do you recollect the comparison between Norman, Ethel, and me? It is so curious. Norman,
      who was ambitious and loved praise, but now dreads nothing so much; Ethel, who never cared for
      anything of the kind, but went straight on her own brave way; and, oh! aunt Flora—me—'</p>
     <p>'Indeed, my dear, I should have thought you had her most full approbation.'</p>
     <p>'Ah! don't you see the tone, as if she were not fully satisfied, as if she only could not
      see surface faults in me,' said Flora; 'and how she said she dreaded my love of praise, and of
      being liked. I wonder how it would have been if she had lived. I have looked back so often in
      the past year, and I think the hollowness began from that time. It might have been there
      before, but I am not so sure. You see, at that dreadful time, after the accident, I was the
      eldest who was able to be efficient, and much more useful than poor Ethel. I think the credit
      I gained made me think myself perfection, and I never did anything afterwards but seek my own
      honour.'</p>
     <p>Mrs. Arnott began better to understand Flora's continued depression, but she thought her
      self-reproach exaggerated, and said something at once soothing and calculated to encourage her
      to undraw the curtain of reserve.</p>
     <p>'You do not know,' continued Flora, 'how greedy I was of credit and affection. It made me
      jealous of Ethel herself, as long as we were in the same sphere; and when I felt that she was
      more to papa than I could be, I looked beyond home for praise. I don't think the things I did
      were bad in themselves—brought up as I have been, they could hardly be so. I knew what merits
      praise and
      <pb n="650"/> blame too well for that—but oh! the motive. I do believe I cared very much for
      Cocksmoor. I thought it would be a grand thing to bring about, but, you see, as it has turned
      out, all I thought I had done for it was in vain; and Ethel has been the real person and does
      not know it. I used to think Ethel so inferior to me. I left her all my work at home. If it
      had not been for that, she might have been happy with Norman Ogilvie—for never were two people
      better matched, and now she has done what I never thought to have left to another—watched over
      our own Margaret. Oh! how shall I ever bear to see her?'</p>
     <p>'My dear, I am sure nothing can be more affectionate than Ethel. She does not think these
      things.'</p>
     <p>'She does,' said Flora. 'She always knew me better than I did myself. Her straightforward
      words should often have been rebukes to me. I shall see in every look and tone the opinion I
      have deserved. I have shrunk from her steadfast looks ever since I myself learnt what I was. I
      could not bear them now—and yet— oh! aunt! you must bring her. Ethel! my dear, dear old King—
      my darling's godmother—the last who was with Margaret!'</p>
     <p>She had fallen into one of those fits of weeping when it was impossible to attempt anything
      but soothing her; but, though she was so much exhausted that Mrs. Arnott expected to be in
      great disgrace with Dr. May for having let her talk herself into this condition, she found
      that he was satisfied to find that she had so far relieved her mind, and declared that she
      would be better now.</p>
     <p>The effect of the conversation was, that the next day, the last of the twelve Christmas
      days, when Ethel, whose yearning after her sister was almost equally divided between dread and
      eagerness— eagerness for her embrace, and dread of the chill of her reserve, came once again
      in hopes of an interview. Dr. May called her at once—'I shall take you in without any
      preparation,' he said, 'that she may not have time to be flurried. Only, be quiet and
      natural.'</p>
     <p>Did he know what a mountain there was in her throat when he seemed to think it so easy to be
      natural?</p>
     <p>She found him leading her into a darkened room, and heard his cheerful tones saying, 'I have
      brought Ethel to you!'</p>
     <p>'Ethel! oh!' said a low, weak voice, with a sound as of expecting a treat, and Ethel was
      within a curtain, where she began, in the dimness, to see something white moving, and her
      hands were clasped by two long thin ones. 'There!' said Dr. May, 'now, if you will be good, I
      will leave you alone. Nurse is by, to look after you, and you know she always separates
      naughty children.'</p>
     <p>Either the recurrence to nursery language, or the mere sisterly touch after long separation,
      seemed to annihilate all the imaginary
      <pb n="651"/> mutual dread, and, as Ethel bent lower and lower, and Flora's arms were round
      her, the only feeling was of being together again, and both at once made the childish gesture
      of affection, and murmured the old pet names of 'Flossy,' and 'King,' that belonged to almost
      forgotten days, when they were baby sisters, then kissed each other again.</p>
     <p>'I can't see you,' said Ethel, drawing herself up a little. 'Why, Flora, you look like a
      little white shadow!'</p>
     <p>'I have had such weak eyes,' said Flora, 'and this dim light is comfortable. I see your old
      sharp face quite plain.'</p>
     <p>'But what can you do here?'</p>
     <p>'Do? Oh! dear Ethel, I have not had much of <hi>doing</hi> . Papa says I have three years
      rest to make up.'</p>
     <p>'Poor Flora!' said Ethel, 'but I should have thought it tiresome, especially for you.'</p>
     <p>'I have only now been able to think again,' said Flora; 'and you will say I am taking to
      quoting poetry. Do you remember some lines in that drama that Norman admired so much?'</p>
     <p>'Philip von Artevelde?'</p>
     <p>'Yes. I can't recollect them <hi>now</hi> , though they used to be always running in my
      head—something about time to mend and time to mourn.'</p>
     <p>'These?' said Ethel— 'He that lacks time to mourn, lacks time to mend. Eternity mourns
      that.' </p>
     <p>'I never had time before for either,' said Flora. 'You cannot think how I used to be haunted
      by those, when I was chased from one thing to another, all these long, long eighteen months. I
      am in no haste to take up work again.'</p>
     <p>'Mending as well as mourning,' said Ethel, thoughtfully.</p>
     <p>Flora sighed.</p>
     <p>'And now you have that dear little Christmas gift to—' Ethel paused.</p>
     <p>'She is not nearly so fine and healthy as her sister was,' said Flora, 'poor little dear.
      You know, Ethel, even now, I shall have very little time with her in that London life. Her
      papa wants me so much, and I must leave her to—to the nurses.' Flora's voice trembled
      again.</p>
     <p>'Our own dear old nurse,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Oh! I wanted to thank you all for sparing her to us,' said Flora. 'George wished it so
      much. But how does poor little Daisy bear it?'</p>
     <p>'Very magnanimously,' said Ethel, smiling. 'In fact, nurse has
      <pb n="652"/> had but little to do with Daisy of late, and would have been very forlorn at
      home. It is better for Aubrey and for her, not to return to be babies to comfort poor nurse. I
      have been breaking up the nursery, and taking Gertrude to live with me.'</p>
     <p>'Have you gone back <hi>there</hi> again?'</p>
     <p>'It would not have been better for waiting,' said Ethel; 'and Gertrude was so proud to come
      to me. I could not have done it without her, but papa must not have vacancy next to him.'</p>
     <p>'It has been hard on you for me to engross him,' said Flora; 'but, oh, Ethel, I could not
      spare him. I don't think even you can tell what papa is.'</p>
     <p>'You have found it out,' said Ethel, in an odd, dry manner; which, in sound, though not in
      feeling, was a contrast to the soft, whispering, tearful murmurs of her sister.</p>
     <p>'And my aunt!' continued Flora—'that I should have taken up such a great piece of her short
      visit!'</p>
     <p>'Ah! it is coming to an end very fast,' said Ethel, sighing; 'but you had the best right to
      her, and she and Meta have seen so much of each other. She tells me she is quite satisfied
      about Meta now.'</p>
     <p>'I am sorry to see Meta looking out of spirits,' said Flora. 'I almost made her cry by
      saying something about Norman. Is there anything going wrong?'</p>
     <p>Ethel, as usual, blundered into the subject. 'Only about Norman's going out.'</p>
     <p>Flora asked further questions, and she was obliged to explain. It roused Flora's energies at
      once.</p>
     <p>'This will never do!' she said. 'They must marry, and go with my aunt.'</p>
     <p>Ethel was aghast. 'They would not hear of it now!'</p>
     <p>'They must. It is the only reasonable thing. Why, Norman would be miserable, and, as to
      Meta—Imagine his going out and returning—a year's work, such an expense and loss of time,
      besides the missing aunt Flora.'</p>
     <p>'If it were not wrong—'</p>
     <p>'The waste would be the wrong thing. Besides—' and she told of Margaret's wishes.</p>
     <p>'But, Flora, think—the last week in February—and you so ill!'</p>
     <p>'I am not to marry them,' said Flora, smiling. 'If it could be in a fortnight, they could go
      and get their outfit afterwards, and come back to us when I am stronger. Let me see—there need
      be no fuss about settlements—Mr. Rivers's will arranges everything for her.'</p>
     <p>'It would be a good thing to get rid of a fine wedding,' said Ethel; 'but they will never
      consent!'</p>
     <pb n="653"/>
     <p>'Yes they will, and be grateful.'</p>
     <p>'Papa would be happier about Norman,' said Ethel; 'but I cannot fancy his liking it. And
      you—you can't spare Meta, for aunt Flora must go to the Arnott's in a week or two more.'</p>
     <p>'Suppose papa was to let me have you,' said Flora. 'If he wants you, he must come after
      you.'</p>
     <p>Ethel gasped at the thought that her occupation at home was gone, but she said—'If I am not
      too awkward for you, dear Flora. You will miss Meta terribly.'</p>
     <p>'I can't keep the humming-bird caged, with her heart far away,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>Dr. May came in to break up the conversation, and Ethel quickly guessed from his manner that
      Norman had been talking to him. Flora told him that she had been agreeing with Ethel that Meta
      had much better not miss this opportunity. He was far less startled than Ethel had expected;
      indeed, the proposal was rather a relief to his mind, and his chief objection was the fear
      that Flora would be fatigued by the extra bustle, but she promised not to trouble herself
      about it, otherwise than that if Norman could not persuade Meta, she would. The sisters
      parted, much more comfortable than before. Ethel felt as if she had found something like a dim
      reflection of Margaret, and Flora's fear of Ethel had fled away from the mere force of
      sisterhood.</p>
     <p>As to Norman, he declared that he had not the audacity to make the proposal to Meta, though
      he was only too grateful—so his father carried it to the humming-bird; and, as soon as she
      found that it was not improper, nor would hurt anyone's feelings, she gave ready consent—only
      begging that it might be as best suited everyone, especially Flora; and ending by a whisper to
      her dear fatherly friend, owning that she was 'very glad—she meant she was very glad there
      would be nobody there.'</p>
     <p>So Norman and Meta settled their plans as they walked home together from evening service,
      after listening to the prophecies of the blessings to be spread into the waste and desolate
      places, which should yet become the heritage of the Chosen, and with the evening star shining
      on them, like a faint reflex of the Star of the East, Who came to be a Light to lighten the
      Gentiles.</p>

     <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
     <p>'Èuna delle facoltà singolari ed incommunicabili della religione Cristiana questa, di poter
      dare indirizzo e quiete a chiunoque, in qualsivoglia congiuntura, a qualsivoglia termine,
      ricorra ad essa. Se al passato v'è rimedio, essa lo prescrive, lo somministra, presta lume e
      vigore per metterlo in opera a qualunque costo; se non v'è, essa dà il, modo di fare realmento
      e in effeto, ciò che l' uom dice in proverbio, della necessita virtù. Insegna a continuare con
      sapienza ciò che è stato intrapreso per leggerezza, piega l'animo ad abbracciare con
      propensione ciò che è stato imposto dalla prepotenza, e dà ad un elezione che fu temeraria, ma
      che e irrevocabile, tutta la santità, tutto il consiglio, diciamolo pur francamenta, tutte le
      gioje della vocazione.'</p>
     <p><hi>Manzoni.</hi></p>
     <p><hi>The</hi> wedding day was fixed for the 20th of January, since it was less risk to Flora
      as an absolute invalid, than as convalescent enough to take any share in the doings.</p>
     <p>Meta managed her correspondance with her own relatives, and obtained her uncle's kind
      approval, since he saw there could be nothing else; while her aunt treated her as an
      infatuated victim, but wished, for her mother's sake, to meet her in London before she
      sailed.</p>
     <p>The worst stroke of all was to Bellairs, who had never chosen to believe that her mistress
      could move without her, and though mortally afraid in crossing to the Isle of Wight, and
      utterly abhorring all "natives," went into hysterics on finding that her young lady would take
      out no maid but a little hardworking village girl; and though transferred in the most
      flattering manner to Mrs. Rivers's service, shed a tear for every stitch she set in the
      trousseau, and assured her betrothed butler, that, if Miss Rivers would only have heard
      reason, she would have followed her to the world's end, rather than that her beautiful hair
      should never look like anything again.</p>
     <p>So the wedding-day came, and grass and trees wore a fitting suit of crisp hoariness. Nothing
      could be quieter. Meta was arrayed by the sobbing Bellairs in her simple bridal white, wrapped
      herself in a large shawl, took her brother's arm, and walked down the frosty path with him and
      Mrs. Arnott, as if going merely to the daily service.</p>
     <p>The time had not been made known, and there was hardly an
      <pb n="655"/> addition to the ordinary congregation, except the May family and Dr. Spencer;
      but the Christmas evergreens still adorned aisle and chancel, and over the Altar stood the
      motto that Meta herself had woven of holly, on that Christmas eve of grief and anxiety,
      without knowing how it would speak to her.</p>
     <p>'Fear not, for behold I bring unto you glad tidings of great joy, that shall be unto you and
      to all people.'</p>
     <p>Fear not, for length of voyage, for distance from kindred, for hardship, privation,
      misunderstanding, disappointment. The glad tidings are to <hi>all</hi> people, even to the
      utmost parts of the earth. Ye have your portion in the great joy—ye have freely cast in your
      lot with those, whose feet are beautiful on the mountains, who bear the good tidings. Fear
      not, for He is with you, who will never forsake.</p>
     <p>Thus Dr. May read the words with swelling heart, as he looked at his son's clear, grave,
      manful look, even as it had been when he made his Confirmation vow—his natural nervous
      excitability quelled by a spirit not his own, and chastened into strong purpose; and the
      bride, her young face the more lovely for the depth of enthusiasm restrained by awe and
      humility, as she stood without trembling or faltering, the strength of innocence expressed in
      the whole bearing of her slight figure in her white drapery. Around were the four sisterly
      bridesmaids, their black dresses shewing that these were still the twilight days of mourning,
      and that none would forget her, whose prayers might still bless their labour of love.</p>
     <p>When Margaret Agatha May, on her husband's arm turned for a last look at the Altar of her
      own Church, "Fear not," in evergreen letters, was the greeting she bore away.</p>
     <p>Ethel was left at the Grange for the ensuing fortnight—a time of unusual leisure both to her
      and to Flora, which they both prized highly, for it taught them to know each other as they had
      never done before. Flora's confidence to her Aunt had been a good thing for her, though so
      partial; it opened the way for further unreserve to one who knew the circumstances better,
      and, as to dread of Ethel, that could seldom prevail in her presence, partly from long habit,
      partly from her deficiency of manner, and still more from her true humility and affection.
      Gradually she arrived at the perception of the history of her sister's mind; understood what
      gloom had once overshadowed it; and how, since light had once shone upon her, she shrank not
      merely from the tasks that had become wearisome to her, but from the dread of losing among
      them her present peace.</p>
     <p>'They are your duty,' argued Ethel. 'Duty brings peace.'</p>
     <p>'They were not,' said Flora.</p>
     <pb n="656"/>
     <p>'They are now,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Dinners and parties, empty talk and vain show,' said Flora, languidly. 'Are you come to
      their defence, Ethel? If you could guess how sick one gets of them, and how much worse it is
      for them not to be hateful! And to think of bringing my poor little girl up to the like, if
      she is spared!'</p>
     <p>'If they are not duties, I would not do them,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'Ethel,' cried her sister, raising herself from her couch, eagerly, 'I will say it to you!
      What should you think of George resigning his seat, and living in peace here?'</p>
     <p>'Would he?' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'If I wished it.'</p>
     <p>'But what would he do with himself?' said Ethel, not in too complimentary a strain.</p>
     <p>'Yachtting, farming, Cochin-chinese—or something,' said Flora. 'Anything not so wearing as
      this!'</p>
     <p>'That abominable candidate of Tomkins's would come in!' exclaimed Ethel. 'Oh! Flora, that
      would be horrid!'</p>
     <p>'That might be guarded against,' said Flora. 'Perhaps Sir Henry—but, oh, let us leave
      politics in peace while we can. I thought we should do some great good, but it is all a maze
      of confusion. It is so hard to know principles from parties, and everything goes wrong! It is
      of no use to contend with it!'</p>
     <p>'It is never vain to contend with evil,' said Ethel.</p>
     <p>'We are not genralizing,' said Flora. 'There is evil nearer home than the state of parties,
      and I can't see that George's being in Parliament—being what he is—is anything like the
      benefit to things in general—that it is temptation and plague to me, besides the risk of
      London life for the baby, now and hereafter.'</p>
     <p>'I can't say that I think it is,' said Ethel. 'How nice it would be to have you here! I am
      so glad you are willing to give it up.'</p>
     <p>'It would have been better to have given it up untasted—like Norman,' sighed Flora. 'I will
      talk to George.'</p>
     <p>'But, Flora,' said Ethel, a little startled. 'You ought not to do such a thing without
      advice.'</p>
     <p>'There will be worry enough before it is done!' sighed Flora. 'No fear of that!'</p>
     <p>'Stop a minute,' said Ethel, as if poor Flora could have done anything but lie still on her
      sofa. 'I think you ought to consider well before you set it going.'</p>
     <p>'Have not I longed for it day and night? It is an escape from peril for ourselves and our
      child.'</p>
     <p>'I can't be sure!' said Ethel. 'It may be more wrong to make George desert the post
      which—'</p>
     <pb n="657"/>
     <p>'Which I thrust him into,' said Flora. 'My father told me as much.'</p>
     <p>'I did not mean you to say that! But it is a puzzle. It seems as if it were right to give up
      such things; yet, when I recollect the difficulty of carrying an election right at
      Stoneborough, I think papa would be very sorry. I don't think his interest would bring in any
      sound man but his son-in-law; and George himself seems to like his parliamentary life better
      than anything else.'</p>
     <p>'Yes,' said Flora, hesitatingly; for she knew it was true—he liked to think himself
      important, and it gave him something to think of, and regular occupation—not too active or
      onerous; but she could not tell Ethel what she herself felt; that all she could do for him
      could not prevent him from being held cheap by the men among whom she had placed him.</p>
     <p>'Then,' said Ethel, as she heard her affirmative, 'I don't think it for his dignity, for you
      to put him into parliament to please you, and then take him out to please you.'</p>
     <p>'I'll take care of his dignity,' said Flora, shortly.</p>
     <p>'I know you would do it well—'</p>
     <p>'I am sick of doing things well!' said poor Flora. 'You little know how I dread reading up
      all I must read presently! I shall lose all I have scarcely gained. I cannot find peace any
      way, but by throwing down the load I gave my peace for.'</p>
     <p>'Whether this is truth or fancy,' said Ethel, thoughtfully. 'If you would ask some one
      competent.'</p>
     <p>'Don't you know there are some things one cannot ask,' said Flora. 'I don't know why I spoke
      to you! Ah! come in! Why, George, that is a finer egg than ever,' as he entered with a
      Shanghae egg in each hand, for her to mark with the date when it had been laid. Poultry was a
      new hobby, and Ethel had been hearing, in her <hi>tête à tête</hi> dinners with George, a
      great deal about the perfections of the hideous monsters that had obtained fabulous prices.
      They had been the best resource for conversation; but she watched, with something between
      vexation and softness, how Flora roused herself to give her full attention and interest to his
      prosing about his pets, really pleased as it seemed; and, at last, encouraging him actually to
      fetch his favourite cock to shew her; when she went through the points of perfection of the
      ungainly mass of feathers, and did not at all allow Ethel to laugh at the unerthly sounds of
      disapproval which handling elicited.</p>
     <p>'And this is our senator!' thought Ethel. 'I wonder whether Honorious's hen was a Shanghae!
      Poor Flora is right—it is poor work to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear! but, putting him
      into the place is one thing, taking him out another. I wish she would
      <pb n="658"/> take advice; but I never knew her do that, except as a civil way of
      communicating her intentions. However, she is not quite what she was! Poor dear! Aunt Flora
      will never believe what a beautiful creature she used to be! It seems wrong to think of her
      going back to that horrid London; but I can't judge. For my part, I'd rather do work, than no
      work for George, and he is a good, kind-hearted fellow after all! I won't be a crab!'</p>
     <p>So Ethel did her best, and said the cock had a bright eye—all she could say for him—and
      George instructed her to admire the awkward legs, and invited her to a poultry show, at
      Whitford, in two days' time—and they sent him away to continue his consultations with the
      poultry woman, which pullets should be preferred as candidates for a prize.</p>
     <p>'Meta set him upon this,' said Flora. 'I hope you will go, Ethel. You see he can be very
      happy here.'</p>
     <p>'Still,' said Ethel, 'the more I think, the more sure I am that you ought to ask
      advice.'</p>
     <p>'I have asked yours,' said Flora, as if it were a great effort. 'You don't know what to
      say—I shall do what I see to be the only way to rest.'</p>
     <p>'I do know what to say,' said Ethel; 'and that is, do as the Prayer-book tells you, in any
      perplexity.'</p>
     <p>'I am not perplexed,' said Flora.</p>
     <p>'Don't say so. This is either the station to which God has called you, or it is not.'</p>
     <p>'He never called me to it.'</p>
     <p>'But you don't know whether you ought to leave it. If you ought not, you would be ten times
      more miserable. Go to Richard, Flora—he belongs to you as much as I—he has authority
      besides.'</p>
     <p>'Richard!'</p>
     <p>'He is the clearest of us all in practical matters,' said Ethel, preventing what she feared
      would be disparaging. 'I don't mean only that you should ask him about this parliament matter
      alone; but I am sure you would be happier and more settled, if you talked things over with him
      before—before you go to Church.'</p>
     <p>'You don't know what you propose.'</p>
     <p>'I do,' said Ethel, growing bolder. 'You have been going all this time by feeling. You have
      never cleared up, and got to the bottom of, your troubles.'</p>
     <p>'I could not talk to anyone.'</p>
     <p>'Not to anyone but a Clergyman. Now, to enter on such a thing is most averse to your nature;
      and I do believe that, for that very reason, it would be what would do you most good. You say
      you have recovered sense of—Oh! Flora, I can't talk of what you have
      <pb n="659"/> gone through; but if you have only a vague feeling that seems as if lying still
      would be the only way to keep it, I don't think it can be altogether sound, or the 'quiet
      conscience' that is meant.'</p>
     <p>'Oh! Ethel! Ethel! I have never told you what I have undergone, since I knew my former
      quietness of conscience was but sleep! I have gone on in agony, with the sense of hypocrisy
      and despair, because I was afraid, for George's sake, to do otherwise.'</p>
     <p>Ethel felt herself utterly powerless to advise; and, after a kind sound of sympathy, sat
      shocked, pondering on what none could answer; whether this were, indeed, what poor Flora
      imagined, or whether it had been a holding-fast to the thread through the darkness. The proud
      reserve was the true evil, and Ethel prayed and trusted it might give way.</p>
     <p>She went very amiably to Whitford with George, and gained great credit with him, for
      admiring the prettiest speckled Hamburgh present; indeed, George was becoming very fond of
      "poor Ethel," as he still called her, and sometimes predicted that she would turn out a fine
      figure of a woman after all.</p>
     <p>Ethel heard, on her return, that Richard had been there; and three days' after, when Flora
      was making arrangements for going to Church, a moment of confidence came over her, and she
      said, 'I did it, Ethel! I have spoken to Richard.'</p>
     <p>'I am so glad!'</p>
     <p>'You were right. He is as clear as he is kind,' said Flora; 'he shewed me that, for George's
      sake, I must bear with my present life, and do the best I can with it, unless some leading
      comes for an escape; and that the glare, and weariness, and being spoken well of, must be
      taken as punishment for having sought after these things.'</p>
     <p>'I was afraid he would say so,' said Ethel. 'But you will find happiness again, Flora
      dear.'</p>
     <p>'Scarcely—before I come to Margaret and to my child,' sighed Flora. 'I suppose it was Mercy
      that would not let me follow when I wished it. I must work till the time of rest comes!'</p>
     <p>'And your own little Margaret will cheer you!' said Ethel, more hopefully, as she saw Flora
      bend over her baby, with a face that might one day be bright.</p>
     <p>She trusted that patient continuance in well-doing, would one day win peace and joy, even in
      the dreary weird that poor Flora had chosen.</p>
     <p>For her own part, Ethel found Flora's practical good sense and sympathy very useful, in her
      present need of the counsel she had always had from Margaret.</p>
     <p>The visit to Flora lasted a fortnight, and Ethel was much benefitted
      <pb n="660"/> by the leisure for reading and the repose after the long nursing; though, before
      the end, her refreshed energies began to pine for Daisy and her hymns, for Aubrey and his
      Virgil, for Cherry and her scholars, and, above all, for her father; for, come as often as he
      would, it was not papa at home.</p>
     <p>On the other hand, Mary was at a loss for Ethel every hour; Richard was putting off his
      affairs till Ethel should come home; Miss Bracy and Blanche longed for her to relieve the
      school-room from the children; Aubrey could not perform a lesson in comfort with anyone
      else—never ended a sum without groaning for Ethel, and sometimes rode to Abbotstoke for the
      mere purpose of appealing to her; in short, no one could get on without her, and the Doctor
      least of all.</p>
     <p>Dr. Spencer, and Mr. Wilmot, and all his sons and daughters, had done their best for him;
      but, in spite of his satisfaction at seeing the two sisters so happy together, he could not
      help missing Ethel every minute, as the very light of his home; and when, at last, Flora
      brought her back, she was received with uproarious joy by Aubrey and Daisy, while the rest of
      the household felt a revival and refreshment of spirits—the first drawing aside of the cloud
      that had hung over the winter. The pearl of their home might be missed every hour, but they
      could thankfully rest in the trust that she was a jewel stored up in safety and peace, to
      shine as a star for evermore.</p>
     <p>A few weeks more, and there were other partings, sad indeed, yet cheery. Dr. May told Mrs.
      Arnott that, though he grieved that so much of sorrow had come to dim her visit, he could not
      but own that it was the very time when her coming could be most comforting; and this, as she
      truly said, was satisfaction enough for her, besides that she could not rejoice enough that
      her arrival had been in time to see their dear Margaret. She should carry away most precious
      recollections; and she further told Dr. Spencer that she was far more comfortable about her
      brother-in-law, than if she had only known him in his youthful character, which had seemed so
      little calculated to bear sorrow or care. She looked at him now only to wonder at, and
      reverence the change that had been gradually wrought by the affections placed above.</p>
     <p>Norman and his wife went with her—the one grave but hopeful, the other trying to wile away
      the pain of parting, by her tearful mirth—making all sorts of odd promises and touching
      requests, between jest and earnest, and clinging to the last to her dear father-in-law, as if
      the separation from him were the hardest of all.</p>
     <p>'Well, humming-birds must be let fly?' said he, at last. 'Ah! ha! Meta, are they of no
      use?'</p>
     <pb n="661"/>
     <p>'Stay till you hear!' said Meta, archly—then turning back once more. 'Oh! how I have thanked
      you, Ethel, for those first hints you gave me how to make my life <hi>real</hi> . If I had
      only sat still and wished, instead of trying what could be done as I was, how unhappy I should
      have been!'</p>
     <p>'Come, take your sprite away, Norman, if you don't want me to keep her for good! God bless
      you, my dear children! Good-bye! Who knows but when Doctor Tom sets up in my place, Ethel and
      I may come out and pay you a visit?'</p>
     <p>It had all been over for some weeks, and the home-party had settled down again into what was
      likely to be their usual course, excepting in the holidays, to which the Doctor looked forward
      with redoubled interest, as Tom was fast becoming a very agreeable and sensible companion; for
      his moodiness had been charmed away by Meta, and principle was teaching him true command of
      temper. He seemed to take his father as a special charge, bequeathed to him by Norman, and had
      already acquired that value and importance at home which comes of the laying aside of all
      self-importance.</p>
     <p>It was a clear evening in March, full of promise of spring, and Ethel was standing in the
      Church porch at Cocksmoor, after making some visits in the parish, waiting for Richard, while
      the bell was ringing for the Wednesday evening service, and the pearly tints of a cloudless
      sunset were fading into the western sky.</p>
     <p>Ethel began to wonder where Norman might be looking at the sun dipping into the Western sea,
      and thence arose before her the visions of her girlhood, when she had first dreamt of a Church
      on Cocksmoor, and of Richard ministering before a willing congregation. So strange did the
      accomplishment seem, that she even touched the stone to assure herself of the reality; and
      therewith came intense thanksgiving that the work had been taken out of her hands, to be the
      more fully blessed and accomplished—that is, as far as the building went; as to the people,
      there was far more labour in store, and the same Hand must be looked to for the increase.</p>
     <p>For herself, Ethel looked back and looked on. Norman Ogilvie's marriage seemed to her to
      have fixed her lot in life, and what was that lot? Home and Cocksmoor had been her choice, and
      they were before her. Home! but her eyes had been opened to see that earthly homes may not
      endure, nor fill the heart. Her dear father might, indeed, claim her full-hearted devotion,
      but, to him, she was only one of many. Norman was no longer solely hers; and she had begun to
      understand that the unmarried woman must not seek undivided return of affection, and must not
      set her love, with exclusive eagerness, on aught below, but must be ready to cease in turn to
      be first with any. Ethel was truly a mother to the younger
      <pb n="662"/> ones; but she faced the probability that they would find others to whom she
      would have the second place. To love each heartily, to do her utmost for each in turn, and to
      be grateful for their fondness was her call; but never to count on their affection as her sole
      right and inalienable possession. She felt that this was the probable course, and that she
      might look to becoming comparatively solitary in the course of years—then tried to realize
      what her lonely life might be, but broke off smiling at herself, 'What is that to me? What
      will it be when it is over? My course and aim are straight on, and He will direct my paths. I
      don't know that I shall be alone, and I shall have the memory—the Communion with them, if not
      their presence. Someone there must be to be loved and helped, and the poor for certain. Only I
      must have my treasure above, and when I think what is there, and of—Oh! that bliss of being
      perfectly able to praise—with no bad old self to mar the full joy of giving thanks, and
      blessing, and honour, and power! Need I dread a few short years?—and they have not begun
      yet—perhaps they won't—Oh! here is actually papa coming home this way! how delightful! Papa,
      are you coming to Church here?'</p>
     <p>'Aye! Ethel. That weathercock of Spencer's is a magnet, I believe! It draws me from all
      parts of the country to hear Richard in St. Andrew's Church.'</p>
