Text identifiers are ENG followed by five digits: the year of publication, followed by a serial number starting with 0. 

Files are named with the text identifier, an underscore, the surname of the author with an initial cap, and ".xml"

e.g. `ENG19100_Forster.xml` is a novel published in 1910 by an author with surname `Forster`. If we had another novel from the same year, its filename would beging `ENG19101`.
