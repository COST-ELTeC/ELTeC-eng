    <head>PREFACE.</head>
    <p>SO many false reports have got about concerning the life and opinions of JOSHUA
     DAVIDSON, the Cornish carpenter, that I feel it to be a duty I owe his memory to tell the truth
     as I know it; leaving the world to judge between what I, his nearest friend, knew of him, and
     what gossips and his enemies have falsely said. As I am neither a gentleman nor a scholar I
     have not pretended to any graces of style; and I have not tried to make an amusing story. My
     little book is more a record of what JOSHUA said and thought than of what happened to him
     through others: that is, there is next to
     <pb n="viii" xml:id="VAB7083-003"/> no dramatic interest in it. Neither do I care to give my
     name. Those who know JOSHUA will know who I am well enough; and if I have said anything wrong
     they can come forward and challenge me. And for the rest it does not signify. I have written
     merely for truth's sake and love's; and with this I leave my dear friend's memory to the
     verdict of all honest hearts.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
    <p>JOSHUA DAVIDSON was the only son of a village carpenter, born in the small hamlet of
     Trevalga on the North Cornwall coast, in the year 1835. His parents were poor but worthy
     people, who kept themselves very much together and had but little to do with the neighbours.
     Folks blamed this for pride, and said they held themselves high because they were the decayed
     branches of an ancient family—some said dating from King Arthur's self. Of course this was only
     <pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7083-005"/> an “Arthurian legend,” if I may call it so, that could not be
     verified; for naturally down about Tintagel everything has to do with King Arthur—even the
     choughs. Joshua sometimes spoke of it, but not from pride; there never was a man freer from
     that failing than he; rather from the belief he had in what a learned man would call hereditary
     transmission, but as we say, just “in the blood,” and a kind of idea that dawned on him, quite
     of late years, that there would be a revival of national glories, national names and leaders,
     under new aspects but from the ancient sources. And if so, might he not count for something,
     direct descendant as he believed he was of the hero whose Castle had been one of his earliest
     playgrounds, and on whose Quoit he had spent many an hour of way-side dreaming
     <pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7083-006"/> ing? It was a fancy; a harmless one; so let it pass for just
     as much as it was worth.</p>
    <p>There was nothing very remarkable about Joshua's childhood. He was always a quiet, thoughtful
     boy, and from his earliest years noticeably pious. His parents came of the Friends' stock; not
     of a strict kind themselves, for they joined in the Church services; but the fact is just an
     indication of the kind of influences which helped to mould him in early youth. He had a habit
     of asking why, and of reasoning out a principle, from quite a little lad; which displeased
     people; so that he did not get all the credit from the schoolmaster and the clergyman to which
     his diligence and good conduct entitled him. They thought him troublesome, and some said he was
     self-conceited; which he never was; but
     <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7083-007"/> the more he was in earnest the more he offended them.</p>
    <p>He was never well looked on by the Vicar since a famous scene that took place in the church
     one Sunday after afternoon catechism. He was then about fourteen years of age, and I have heard
     say he was a beautiful boy, with a face almost like a young woman's for purity and
     spirituality. He was so beautiful that some ladies and gentlemen staying at the Vicarage
     noticed him during church time, and said he looked like a boy-saint. But he knew nothing about
     himself. I question if he knew whether his hair was black like mine, or, as it was, a bright
     brown like ripe nuts in the sunshine. After catechism was over he stood out before the rest,
     just in his rough country clothes as he vas, and said very respectfully to the
     <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7083-008"/> Vicar, Mr. Grand:<ref target="#linton-joshuanote00" n="*"/>
     “If you please sir, I would like to ask you a few questions.”</p>
    <p>“Certainly, my lad, what have you to say?” said Mr. Grand rather shortly. He did not seem
     over well pleased at the boy's addressing him; but he could not well refuse to hear him because
     of the ladies and gentlemen with him, and especially Mr. Freeman, a very good old man who
     thought well of everybody, and let everybody do pretty much as they liked.</p>
    <p>“If we say, sir, that Jesus Christ was God,” said Joshua, “surely all that He said and did
     must be the real right? There cannot be a better way than His?”</p>
    <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7083-009"/>
    <p>“Surely not, my lad,” Mr. Grand made answer; “what else have you been taught all your life?
     what else have you been saying in your catechism just now?”</p>
    <p>“And His apostles and disciples, they showed the way too?” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“And they showed the way too, as you say; and if you come up to half they taught you'll do
     well, Joshua.”</p>
    <p>The Vicar laughed a little laugh as he said this; but it was a laugh, Joshua's mother said,
     that seemed to mean the same thing as a “scat”—our Cornish word for a blow—only the boy didn't
     seem to see it.</p>
    <p>“Yes; but, sir, it is not of myself I am thinking, it is of the world,” said Joshua. “If we
     are Christians, why don't we live as Christians?”</p>
    <p>“Ah indeed! why don't we!” said Mr.
     <pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7083-010"/> Grand. “Because of the wickedness of the human heart; because
     of the world, the flesh, and the devil!”</p>
    <p>“Then, sir, if you feel this, why don't you and all the clergy live like the apostles, and
     give what you have to the poor?” cried Joshua, clasping his hands and making a step forward,
     the tears in his eyes. “Why, when you read that verse, ‘Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth
     his brother have need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in
     him?’ do you live in a fine house, and have grand dinners, and let Peggy Bray nearly starve in
     that old mud hut of hers, and widow Tregellis there, with her six children, and no fire or
     clothing for them? I can't make it out, sir ! Christ was GOD; and we are Christians; yet we
     won't do as He ordered,
     <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7083-011"/> though you tell us it is a sin that can never be forgiven if
     we dispute what the Bible says.”</p>
    <p>“And so it is,” said Mr. Grand sternly. “Who has been putting these bad thoughts in to your
     head?”</p>
    <p>“No one sir. I have been thinking for myself. Michael, out by Lion's Den, is called an
     infidel; he calls himself one; and you preached last Sunday that no infidel can be saved; but
     Michael helped Peggy and her base child when the Orphan Fund people took away her pension,
     because, as you yourself told her, she was a bad woman, and it was encouraging wickedness; and
     he worked early and late for widow Tregellis and her children, and shared with them all he had,
     going short for them many a time. And I can't help thinking, sir, that Christ,
     <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7083-012"/> who forgave all manner of sinners, would have helped Peggy
     with her base child, and that Michael, being an infidel and such a good man, is something like
     that second son in the Parable who said he would not do his Lord's will when he was ordered,
     but who went all the same—”</p>
    <p>“And that your Vicar is like the first?” interrupted Mr. Grand angrily.</p>
    <p>“Well, yes, sir, if you please,” said Joshua quite modestly but very fervently.</p>
    <p>There was a great stir among the ladies and gentlemen when Joshua said this; and some laughed
     a little, under their breath because it was in church, and others lifted up their eyebrows, and
     said, “What an extraordinary boy!” and whispered together; but Mr. Grand was very angry, and
     said in a severe tone—</p>
    <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7083-013"/>
    <p>“These sinners are beyond the knowledge of an ignorant lad like you, Joshua; and I advise
     you, before you turn questioner and reformer, to learn a little humility and respect for your
     betters. I consider you have done a very impertinent thing to-day, and I shall mark you for
     it!”</p>
    <p>“I did not wish to be impertinent, sir,” said Joshua eagerly; “I want only to know the right
     of things from you, and to do as God has commanded, and Christ has shown us the way. And as you
     are our clergyman, and this is the House of God, I thought it the best plan to ask. I want only
     to know the truth; and I cannot make it out!”</p>
    <p>“Hold your tongue, sir!” said Mr. Grand. “God has commanded you to obey your pastors and
     masters and all that are in
     <pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7083-014"/> authority over you; so let us have no more of this folly.
     Believe as you are taught, and do as you are told, and don't set yourself up as an independent
     thinker in matters you understand no more than the ass you drive. Go back to your place, sir,
     and another time think twice before you speak to your superiors.”</p>
    <p>“I meant no harm. I meant only the truth and to hear the things of God,” repeated Joshua
     sadly, as he took his seat among his companions; who tittered.</p>
    <p>When they all went out of church Mr. Grand was heard to say to Mr. Freeman: “You will see,
     Freeman, that boy will go to the bad; he will turn out a pestilent fellow, a freethinker and a
     democrat. Oh, I know the breed, with their cant about truth and the right! He richly deserved a
     flogging to-day
     <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7083-015"/> if ever boy did; to dare to take me to task in my own
     church!”</p>
    <p>But Mr. Freeman said gently; “I don't think he meant it for insolence. I think the lad was in
     earnest, though of course he should not have spoken as he did.”</p>
    <p>“Earnest or not, he must be taught better manners for the future,” said Mr. Grand.</p>
    <p>And so it was that Joshua was not well looked on by the clergyman, who was his enemy, as one
     may say, ever after.</p>
    <p>All this made a great talk at the time, and there are many who remember the whole thing at
     this present day; as any one would find if they were to ask down at Trevalga; but all that
     Joshua was ever heard to say of it was: “I thought only of what was right in the sight of God;
     I never thought of man at all.”</p>
    <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7083-016"/>
    <p>He did not however, repeat the experiment of asking inconvenient questions of his social
     superiors in public; but it was noticed that after this he became more and more thoughtful, and
     more and more under the influence of a higher principle than lads of his age are usually
     troubled with. And though always tender to his parents and respectful to the schoolmaster and
     minister, and the like of that, yet he was less guided by what might be called expediency in
     his conduct, and more than ever a stickler for the uncompromising truth, and the life as lived
     by Jesus Christ. He was not uncomfortable to live with, his mother said; quite the contrary; no
     one ever saw him out of temper, and no one ever knew him do a bad thing; but he somehow forced
     his parents to be always up to the mark, and
     <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7083-017"/> even the neighbours were ashamed to talk loosely or say what
     they shouldn't before a lad whose whole thought, whose sole endeavour was, “how to realise
     Christ.”</p>
    <p>“Mother,” he once said, as he and Mrs. Davidson stood by the cottage door together, “I mean
     when I grow up to live as our Lord and Saviour lived when He was on the earth. For though he is
     God in Heaven he was only man here; and what He did we too can do with His help and the Holy
     Spirit's.”</p>
    <p>“He is our example, lad,” said his mother reverently. “But I doubt lest you fall by over
     boldness.”</p>
    <p>“Then, if imitation is over bold, His life was a delusion, and He is not our example at all,”
     said Joshua. “Which is a saying of the devil.”</p>

    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
    <p>JOSHUA did not leave home early. He wrought at his father's bench and was content to
     bide with his people. But his spirit was not dead if his life was uneventful. He gathered about
     him a few youths of his own age, and held with them prayer meetings and Bible readings, either
     at home in his father's house, or in the fields when the throng was too great for the cottage.
     It gave one a feeling as of old primitive times to be sitting there under the clear sky of a
     summer's evening, with the larks singing over head, and the swallows and sea birds
     <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7083-019"/> flashing through the air, the voice of the waves as they beat
     up against Long Island subdued to a tender murmur that seemed to have a mystery somehow in it,
     and the young carpenter reading to us of Christ, and praying for the power to be like unto Him
     in life and heart; praying with an earnestness, a realization, a very passion of entreaty—nay,
     I have never heard or seen aught like it since, in church or chapel either!</p>
    <p>And then he himself was so unlike other boys. He was so upright, so steadfast! No one ever
     knew Joshua tell the shadow of a lie, or go back from his word, or play at pretence. And he had
     such an odd way of coming right home to us. He seemed to have felt all that we felt, and to
     have thought all our thoughts. Young as he was, he was our leader even then. We all looked
     <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7083-020"/> for great things from him. I should be laughed at if I said
     how high our expectations reached.</p>
    <p>The youths that Joshua go together as his friends were as well-conditioned a set of lads as
     you could wish to see; sober, industrious, chaste. They were never in any trouble, and no one
     could say they had ever heard one of them give back a bad word, whatever the provocation, or
     say a loose one; but the clergy of their several parishes scouted them, and stood at no evil to
     say of them. For they were not church-goers; and that is always an offence to the clergy of
     country parishes, who treat even the best of the Dissenters as little better than rogues,
     taking it partly as a personal affront and partly as a moral sin if their parishioners find
     greater comfort for their poor souls elsewhere
     <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7083-021"/> where than under them. However, for the matter of that, the
     lads were of no denomination; and though they prayed much and often, it was neither at church
     nor chapel; it was at their own houses or in the fields.</p>
    <p>Their aim was to be thorough and like Christ. They denounced the sin of luxury among
     professing Christians, and spared no one, lay or clerical: so did Christ, they said. They set
     their faces against the priestly class altogether, and maintained that Christ as High Priest
     needed no subordinate or go-between, and that the modern parson was only the ancient Pharisee,
     whom Christ was never weary of denouncing. They were anti-Sabbatarians too, as He had been, and
     held the doctrine of freedom in Christ throughout. They believe implicitly every word of the
     Gospels, which they stood by as
     <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7083-022"/> fuller of the Divine Life than the Epistles; and they thought
     that the Example left the world was the one thing to follow and the one pattern to imitate.
     Joshua's great hope and desire, confessed among us, was to bring back the world to the
     simplicity and broad humanity of Christ's acted life; and as a believer in the divinity of that
     life, he could not understand how it had been let drop. His one central point was the same now
     as that which had formerly troubled him—and Mr. Grand; namely, how, if Christ was God, and His
     life given to us as our example, do we not follow it literally, in simple exactness, and as we
     find it set before us in the Gospels? And he believed that God would strengthen his hands, not
     only to enable him to realise this in his own person, but also to evangelise society, and bring
     it over to the
     <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7083-023"/> Truth along with him. He was waiting for a Sign; and he
     believed it would be given him.</p>
    <p>He was but a young man at this time, remember; enthusiastic, with little or no scientific
     knowledge and with much of the logic of fanaticism; unable to judge between the possible and
     the impossible, and putting the direct interposition of God above the natural law. Wherefore,
     he accepted the text about faith removing mountains as literally true, and possible to be done.
     Given the faith, the mountain would move. And one evening he went down into the Rocky Valley,
     earnest to try conclusions with God's promise, and sure of proving it true. He had fasted all
     day, and he had prayed all day; not necessarily kneeling and repeating set forms, but in the
     whole attitude of his mind;
     <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7083-024"/> and in the twilight when work was over he went down with
     three of us, myself and two others, a certain that the truth of the Word would be made
     manifest, and that he could remove rocks by FAITH.</p>
    <p>He prayed to God to grant us this manifestation—to redeem His promise. He was full of faith:
     not a shadow of doubt chilled or slacked him. As he stood there in the softening twilight, with
     his arms raised above his head and his face turned up to the sky, his countenance glowed as
     Moses' of old. He seemed inspired, transported beyond himself, beyond humanity. He commanded
     the stone to move in God's name, and because Christ had promised: and we knelt beside him, not
     so much trembling as exalted, feeling in the very presence of the Divine, and that He would do
     unto us
     <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7083-025"/> according to His word. But the rock stood still; and a
     stonecchat went and perched on it.</p>
    <p>Another time he took up a viper in his hand, quoting the psalm, “They shall take up
     serpents.” But the beast stung him, and he was ill for days after. So, when he ate a handful of
     the berries of the black briony, and all but died of the poison. Yet he had handled the viper
     and eaten the berries in faith as simple and sincere as when he had commanded the stone in the
     Rocky Valley to move.</p>
    <p>When the doctor was called in, and Joshua told him, boylike, what he had done and why and in
     what spirit, he shook his head gravely, and told his mother he was mad and had better be looked
     after.</p>
    <p>“No, no, not mad, sir, because I believe
     <pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7083-026"/> the Bible, and have determined to lead a life after Christ's
     word and example,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“Tut! rubbish!” said the doctor. “What you've got to do, my lad, is to plane your wood smooth
     and make your joists firm. All this religious folly of yours has no sense in it. I tell you it
     will upset your brain, and that you are mad now, and will be madder if you don't pull up in
     time.”</p>
    <p>“So Festus said to St. Paul, sir; but he was not mad, nor am I.”</p>
    <p>“But what do you want to do, jackass?” said the doctor with a good-humoured kind of
     impatience. “What's amiss with your poor foolish head that you can't take things easy?”</p>
    <p>“I want to find out which is true, sir,”
     <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7083-027"/> answered Joshua: “the Bible which ordains certain ways of
     life; or the Christian world which disobeys them. If Christ was God, there is but one way for
     us all. He could not have left us an imperfect example to be mended here and there as we think
     best for the convenience of society. He is God or man; for, as things are, it is not God and
     man—Christ and Christians; and I want to know which is the truth.”</p>
    <p>“Take my advice,” said the doctor kindly; “put all these thoughts out of your head as quickly
     as you can. Get some work to do in a new part of the country, fall in love with some nice girl,
     and marry as soon as you can make a home for her. Give over reading the Bible for a time, and
     look up some pleasant stories and books of travel, and the like; and leave off
     <pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7083-028"/> eating poison-berries and handling vipers. That's the only
     life for you, depend upon it; and though I am no theologian, I venture to say, that working
     honestly in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call you, going to church,
     kneeling out of beershops, and living like your respectable neighbours, is a far better kind of
     thing than all this high-flown religion you are hankering after. Depend upon it, our best
     religion is to do our duty, and to leave the care of our souls to those whose business it is to
     look after them.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you, sir; you mean kindly,” said Joshua. “But God has given me other thoughts, and I
     must obey them if I would not sin against the Holy Ghost.”</p>
    <p>And the doctor said afterwards to Mr. Grand, that he was quite touched at the lad's
     <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7083-029"/> sweetness and wrong-headedness combined, and would have given
     much to have been able to send him there and then to a lunatic asylum, where he might have been
     taken care of for a time and put to rights.</p>
    <p>The failure of these trials of faith perplexed us all, and profoundly afflicted Joshua. Not
     many men have gone through greater spiritual anguish, I should suppose, than he did at this
     time. It was like the sudden darkening of the sun to him, and the doubt of himself which it
     brought was nearer madness than his simple faith had been. He passed through a bad time; when
     his soul went down into the Valley of the Shadow, if ever man's did! But in time he came out
     into the light again. He knew his own sincerity, and his entire acceptance
     <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7083-030"/> of the Word of God and of the Divinity of Christ; and he
     could not think that God had met his prayer with a rebuff. God, who knew the heart, would he
     felt sure have accepted his endeavour, had that endeavour been within the scope of His plan for
     humanity. It was the first struggle between Faith and Law, Revelation and Nature, through which
     every inquiring mind has to pass; and it was a bitter one.</p>
    <p>He said nothing of these thoughts for many weeks. He was not a youth who jumped to
     conclusions, but rather one who pondered well, and who let his thoughts ripen; but at last he
     spoke one evening, when we were gathered together as usual, after work.</p>
    <p>“Friends,” he said, “it seems to me—
     <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7083-031"/> indeed, I think we must all see it now—that His Word is not
     to be accepted literally, and not to be acted on in all its details. The laws of Nature are
     supreme, and even faith cannot change them. Can it be,” he then said solemnly, “that much of
     that Word is a parable?—that Christ was truly as he says of Himself, the corner stone, but not
     the whole building?—and that we have to carry on the work in His spirit, but in our own way,
     and not merely to try and repeat His acts?”</p>
    <p>I do not think we were prepared for such a speech. We looked at one another uneasily, even
     the dimmest of us seeing something of the conclusions to which such a principle would lead us,
     and forecasting the rudderless wandering of souls that would ensue. But Joshua would say no more.
     <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7083-032"/> He bade us good-night soon after, and it was long before we
     renewed the subject. We all felt that he had broken dangerous ground; for had we not set out
     with the determination to realise Christ in our lives, founded on our conviction of the
     literalness, the absolute uncompromising truth of every word in the Gospels?—a truth not to be
     explained away, or paraphrased in any manner of worldly wisdom or expediency; but to be
     accepted crude, naked, entire as it is set down? It was one thing, or the other—Christ or
     society, the Bible or the world. It could not be both; but once admit the right of choice, of
     criticism, and where was then our standard? Yet again, what could we make of that text about
     faith, when we had proved it for ourselves and found it wanting? And if wrong in
     <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7083-033"/> ever so small a matter, was not our theory of absolute
     infallibility at an end? But if absolute infallibility was at an end, was not that making
     Christ a mere temporary teacher, local and for the day—not universal and for all time; and God
     a bit by bit worker? And if so, and even Gospel revelation is not final, where then exists the
     absolute necessity of acceptance? Yet, if we came to this conclusion—sorrowfullest of all!—we
     must relinquish all anchorage everywhere, and do our best to piece together a theory of life
     for ourselves, glad if any of the broken fragments of faith might still serve us.</p>
    <p>But we were far off, as yet, from any such conclusions; and the Christ life, and the Gospel
     narrative, and the need laid on us all to follow in the Master's steps, and believe
     <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7083-034"/> lieve as He taught, and do as He did, were still the cardinal
     points of Joshua's creed, and the object of his endeavour: and, with him, of ours.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
    <p>IT was after this that we noticed a certain restlessness in Joshua. He seemed to
     feel the narrowness of his life down at such a place as Trevalga, where a man must work hard to
     keep body and soul together, and keep them very poorly when he has done his best; and where he
     cannot get forward save by his own thoughts. There is nothing for an energetic-minded young man
     to do there after his day's work is over. No lectures, no mechanics' institute, no library;
     only a few books to be borrowed here and there by chance. And Boscastle and Trevenna are
     <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7083-036"/> no farther advanced; nor was even Camelford in those days.
     And then Camelford is full five miles away, across a wild whisht country that does not invite
     much night walking. To be sure there are the cliffs and the sea, the waterfall up at Knighton's
     Kieve, the rocks and the old ruins at Tintagel—King Arthur's Castle—which fill the imagination.
     But imagination does very well for extreme youth, as looking back does for old age: a man
     coming to his prime wants action.</p>
    <p>An opening however came in time, and Joshua had an offer to go up to London to follow his
     trade at a large house in the City; which he accepted; and got me a job as well, that I might
     be alongside of him. For we were like brothers; he, the elder, the better, the leader; and I,
     the younger, the led. And
     <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7083-037"/> neither was afraid of work; or, let me add, afraid for our
     work. We were skilled in our trade so far as we could be without first-rate teaching, having
     made it a point of duty and honour both, that we should never give folks occasion to talk of us
     as babbling saunterers, who took to the Bible because they could not manage the plane and the
     saw.</p>
    <p>A few days before he went, Joshua happened to be coming out of his father's workshop just as
     Mr. Grand was passing, driving the neat pair-horse phaeton he had lately bought.</p>
    <p>“Well, Joshua, and how are you doing?” said the parson, pulling up.</p>
    <p>I dare say he was a good man when he was at home, but Mr. Grand was not fit to be a parish
     priest—at all events, not of such a place as Trevalga. He might have made
     <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7083-038"/> a fine general officer, or a dignitary in a field where he
     had nothing to do with the poor; but among a lot of half-starving, uneducated creatures, such
     as you find in a by-kind of coast hamlet in Cornwall, he was worse than useless. He had no love
     for the poor, and no pity: he always called them “the common people,” and spoke of them
     disdainfully, as if they were different creatures from gentry. I question if he allowed us the
     same kind of souls; and I do know that he denied equality of condition after death, and quoted
     the text of “many mansions” in proof of his theory of exclusion. He was a man of good family
     himself, and his wife was the daughter of a bishop; he was rich too, and looked to be made dean
     or bishop himself by time. So you see, Trevalga was only a stopping-place with him, where he
     <pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7083-039"/> just put off the time the best way he could till he saw his
     way to better things; and didn't care a rush for any one in the place.</p>
    <p>However, he drew up at seeing Joshua, and asked him how he was; and then said: “And why have
     you not been to church lately, my man?” as if Joshua had been in the habit of going, and had
     failed only of late. This was Mr. Grand's way. He never knew anything about his people. That
     gave them to think, you see, that he held himself too high to notice what such poor wretches
     might be about. God forgive me if I misjudge him!</p>
    <p>“Well, sir,” said Joshua, “I don't go to church, you know.”</p>
    <p>“No? have you joined the chapel then? Is that your latest fad, Joshua?”</p>
    <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7083-040"/>
    <p>“No, sir; neither church nor chapel,” answered Joshua.</p>
    <p>“What! a new light on your own account, hey?” and he laughed as if he mocked him.</p>
    <p>“No sir, only a seeker.”</p>
    <p>“The old paths not good enough for you?—the light that has lightened the Gentiles these
     eighteen hundred years and more not pure enough for an unwashed Cornish lad, planing wood at a
     carpenter's bench and not able to speak two consecutive words of good English?”</p>
    <p>“I must answer for my conscience to God, sir,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“And your clergyman, appointed by God and the State to be your guide, what of him? Has he no
     authority in his own parish?” cried Mr. Grand warmly. “Does
     <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7083-041"/> it never strike you, my fine fellow, that in thinking for
     yourself, as you call it, you are flying in the face both of Divine ordinances and the laws of
     man, and that you are entering on the sin of schism on the one hand, and of rebellion on the
     other?”</p>
    <p>“Look here, sir,” said Joshua with earnestness, but quite respectfully; “if I speak plainly,
     I mean it for no offence; but my heart burns within me and I must speak out. I deny your
     appointment as a God-given leader of souls. The Church is but the old priesthood as it existed
     in the days of our Lord, and is, as much as that was, the blind leading the blind. There are
     good and kind gentlemen among you, but not Christians according to Christ. I see no sacrifice
     of the world, no brotherhood with the poor—”</p>
    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7083-042"/>
    <p>“The poor!” interrupted Mr. Grand disdainfully; “what would you have, you young fool? The
     poor have the laws of their country to protect them, and the Gospel preached to them for their
     salvation.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, and in preaching that—that is, in giving two full services on Sundays, and reading the
     marriage-service and the burial-service and the like of that when you are wanted—you discharge
     your conscience of all other obligations towards them, and think you have done enough. You
     never seem to remember that when Christ preached the Gospel to the poor it was to make them
     equal with the rich. Why, sir, the poor of our day are the lepers of Christ's; and who among
     you, Christian priests, consorts with them? Who ranks the man above his station, or the soul
     above the man?”</p>
    <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7083-043"/>
    <p>“Now, we have come to it!” cried Mr. Grand. “I thought I should touch the secret spring at
     last! And you would like us to associate with you as equals?—Is that it, Joshua? Gentlemen and
     common men hob-and-nob together, and no distinctions made? You to ride in our carriages, and
     perhaps marry our daughters?”</p>
    <p>He had his little girl of six or so in the phaeton with him; a pretty little maid that used
     to go about dressed in blue velvet and a white feather in her hat.</p>
    <p>“That's just it, sir. You are gentlemen, as you say, but not the followers of Christ. If you
     were, you would have no carriages to ride in, and your daughters would be what Martha and Mary
     and Lydia and Dorcas were, women of no station, bent only on serving God and the saints, and
     their title
     <pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7083-044"/> to ladyhood founded on their degrees of goodness.”</p>
    <p>“Going in for socialism, Joshua?” said Mr. Grand, continuing his bantering tone. “A little
     radicalism, a little methodism, and a great deal of self-assurance—that seems to me to be about
     where you are!”</p>
    <p>“Going in for no isms at all, sir,” said Joshua. “Only for the truth as it is in Christ!”</p>
    <p>“Shall I tell you what would be the very thing for you?” said Mr. Grand quite quietly.</p>
    <p>“Yes, sir; what?” asked Joshua eagerly.</p>
    <p>“This whip across your shoulders!—and, by George, if I were not a clergyman I would lay it
     there, with a will!” cried the parson, half rising from his seat.</p>
    <p>No one had ever seen Joshua angry since
     <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7083-045"/> he had grown up. His temper was proverbially sweet, and his
     self-control was a marvel. But this time he lost both. It was not so much as a man, because of
     the insult to himself; he would have borne that meekly enough; but it was the feeling that the
     Sacred Thing had been mocked in him which drove him into sudden anger: an anger so violent and
     so sudden as to take the clergyman fairly aback.</p>
    <p>“God shall smite thee, thou whited wall!” he cried with vehemence. “Is this your boasted
     leadership of souls?—this your learned solving of difficulties?—this your fatherly guidance of
     your flock? ‘Feed my lambs’—with what? with stones for bread—with insult for sincerity—with the
     gentleman's disdain for the poor thought of the artisan—with class insolence for spiritual difficulties
     <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7083-046"/> culties! Of a surety, Christ has to come again to repeat the
     work which you priests and churches have destroyed and made of no effect, and to strip you of
     your ill-used power. You are the gentleman, sir, and I am only a poor carpenter's son; but I
     stand against you now—man against man—soul against soul—and I spurn you with a deeper and more
     solemn scorn than you have spurned me!” He lifted his hand as he said this, with a strange and
     passionate gesture, then turned himself about and went in; and Mr. Grand drove off more his
     ill-wisher than before; as perhaps was only natural. And yet he rightly deserved all he had
     got.</p>
    <p>This was one of the stories that got bruited abroad to Joshua's discredit. Some said he had
     struck the parson—some that he
     <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7083-047"/> had been monstrously and unjustifiably impertinent; and the
     tale got bandied about as a kind of dramatic scarecrow—a kind of logical warning to young men
     given to think for themselves, as to what would become of them if they shook themselves free of
     authority. “You'll be as bad as Joshua to Parson Grand,” was a phrase I myself heard more than
     once. But here is the story just as it happened; and I put it to my readers—was Joshua so very
     much to blame, all things considered—motives, feelings, spiritual disappointment, and that
     inner dignity of Man which overpowers all social differences when the fit moment comes? I can
     only say that never, to the last, could he be got to see that he had done wrong, and never, to
     the last, could I say it or see it either.</p>
    <p>“No,” he used to say, “some kinds of
     <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7083-048"/> anger are righteous; and this was of them.”</p>
    <p>But Mr. Grand made old Davidson, Joshua's father, suffer for his son; for he took away his
     own custom from him, and did him what harm in the neighbourhood a gentleman's ill-word can do a
     working man. It was a bad thing for the old man. The Trevalga schools were being built, and St.
     Juliot's church was under repair, and Davidson, as the best workman thereabouts, would have
     been sure to have been head man at both jobs. But Mr. Grand, he put his spoke in that wheel;
     and one day when I took courage to speak and plead, all I got was a recommendation to mind my
     own business, and not interfere where I was not wanted. And then as if in consideration—a kind
     of condescending consideration—for
     <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7083-049"/> my being a “canter,” Mr. Grand wound up with saying that I
     must see he was justified according to the law of God.</p>
    <p>When I challenged him hotly, I daresay intemperately, I daresay even impertinently, for his
     proof—for you see I was but a poor uneducated artisan, and he was a gentleman and a scholar—he
     laughed, and said he did not argue with carpenters' lads; and when I answered back, he ordered
     me out of the house, saying I was as pestilent a fellow as my friend;—I replying angrily that I
     did not think the pestilence rested with Joshua. Which ended the interview; not without loss of
     temper and dignity on both sides, and no good done to anyone.</p>
    <p>The night before we left for London Joshua had a kind of vision or waking dream, which he
     told me as we were on our
     <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7083-050"/> way to Launceston, walking up the hill from Boscastle, while
     the omnibus toiled after us. He was on the cliff by Long Island, when suddenly he seemed to be
     caught away to a wide plain, where many men were gathered. In the centre of the plain was a
     hill, like Brown Willy out there by Camelford, and on this hill sat two kingly figures who
     ruled over the swarming multitudes below. They sat together hand in hand, and he saw that they
     were in some mysterious manner inseparable. The one was dressed as a high priest, and was
     Ecclesiastical Christianity; the other as a king, and was Society; and both were stern,
     forbidding, and oppressive. The only persons to whom they showed favour were the well-dressed
     and the subservient—rich people dressed in gold and jewels, and
     <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7083-051"/> the poor and undistinguished who were submissive and
     conforming; who accepted all that the high priest taught without questioning the truth of any
     part, and who obeyed what the king ordained without even so much as a wish to resist. These
     were called Believing Christians and Respectable Members of Society; and, in consideration of
     their obedience, both the high priest and the king smiled on them, and spoke them fair. Yet
     they were scarcely friendly to their adherents. The one surrounded them with the most monstrous
     shapes of demons cast by magic lanterns and in every way unreal, of which they were in
     continual fear—GOD, whom yet they labelled “Our Father,” and the “God of Love,” the most
     terrible looking demon of all; and the more they were afraid, and the more
     <pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7083-052"/> cruel they believed Our Father to be, the more Ecclesiastical
     Christianity was content. The other bound them round and round with chains and swathing bands,
     till they were scarcely able to move or breathe. And when they submitted to the stifling
     torture with a good grace—some of them even drawing the links tighter, and buckling up the
     thongs more home of their own accord, and all declaring the pattern of each particular bandage
     to have been sent down direct from heaven, and in no wise invented as an experiment by
     Society—then the king smiled on them kindly, and praised them with many flattering words; and
     the poor atrophied wretches were quite content with the barren honour of their reward.</p>
    <p>At the feet of these two rulers lay three figures cruelly bound and tortured. They
     <pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7083-053"/> were Truth, bearing in her arms her young child Science,
     Freedom, and Humanity. All three were stretched on racks made in the form of a cross, which
     gave in the eyes of the multitude a kind of symbolic sanction to their torture. The two rulers
     were for ever trying to gag them, so that they should not speak; but they could not quite
     succeed; and every now and then they uttered words, loud and clear as the sound of a silver
     trumpet, that stirred the multitude below, and set men running hither and thither, some shaking
     themselves free of the bonds in which both Christianity and Society had bound them. And when
     they spoke, the high priest and the king and their worshippers, all the well-dressed little
     kings and poorer conformists, buffeted them; and would have killed them if they could.</p>
    <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7083-054"/>
    <p>Ill-treated as they were however, each tortured being had a small knot of adherents. Round
     Truth, bearing her young child, Science, gathered men of imposing aspect—men of authority, of
     large brains, of temperate nature, of clear and candid thought. There were some among them of
     such unquestionable grandeur, that even the mob of Believing Christians and Respectable Members
     of Society paid them a certain cold, deprecatory reverence as they passed; while Ecclesiastical
     Christianity tried to reconcile their statements with his own creed, hiding his magic lantern
     painted with demons and that all-devouring hell with which he terrified the multitudes, when he
     spoke to them saying, “See, there is no such great difference between us after all! I do not
     contradict you. Say what you will about the
     <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7083-055"/> sun, and the age of the earth, the relations of the universe,
     and the gradual evolution of man, nothing that you advance disturbs me. I only supplement you,
     and add the divine grace of spiritual truth, which is beyond your analysis. You are right and I
     am right; let us be friends and brothers.”</p>
    <p>Society was less concerned about these philosophers. They were for the most part swathed in
      <emph>his</emph> bands tight enough; some for pre-occupation with other matters, some for
     expediency, some for dread of the unknown, and some for conviction; and, for the rest, he let
     his twin-brother, the high priest, fight his battles as he best could.</p>
    <p>Round the prostrate form of Freedom, scarred, gashed, bleeding, fettered, stood only a few.
     Even the men of science were
     <pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7083-056"/> afraid of this huge giant, this son of the old gods, whose
     might no one had been able to calculate should he once arise in his strength. All, save his own
     few lovers, chiefly of the poorest class, looked on him with dread, and prophesied evil days
     for the world should he ever get free of his bonds and the symbolic constraint of the cross.
     But his small band of lovers, themselves either martyrs or victims, worked incessantly at his
     deliverance; every now and then getting one link loosened here and another there, knowing that
     in time he would with their help shake himself free of all his chains, and stand up before the
     world, the great-hearted leader, the glad possession of every man and woman that breathes.</p>
    <p>The third figure was the most deeply oppressed. The face was hidden, but it was
     <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7083-057"/> a lovely form, vilely clad in disfiguring garments, and
     bespattered with dirt that had been flung at it by the high priest and Society in concert. On
     its nailed hands hung the weeping and the miserable; and no one was rejected or bidden back.
     The most miserable sinner that crawled—the thief, the murderer, the harlot—it gathered them all
     around it; its own bound hands doing their checked best to free them from their stains.
     Pleasure and pain and sin and virtue all rested equally on its large breast, and to all it gave
     full sympathy and understanding. It condemned no one; only it refused obedience to the high
     priest and the king. As the dreamer looked, it slowly turned its face to the sky: and Joshua
     recognised in the soiled and vilified face of Humanity—the face of Christ.</p>
    <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7083-058"/>
    <p>Suddenly standing side by side with the magnificently attired pontiff, this Ecclesiastical
     Christianity, oppressor of Truth, slanderer of Humanity, tyrant of Freedom, ruler of the
     churches, and through them of the consciences of men; side by side too, with his twin-brother
     Society, his fellow-tyrant and oppressor, was a man coarsely clad in rude garments, a man of
     uncultured speech, of unconventional manners, but of a noble aspect, whose face was the face of
     an enthusiast who believed in himself, and in whose self-reliance were his sole credentials.
     His companions were the same as those who had gathered round the crucified form of Humanity.
     All the poor and the miserable, the leprous, the sinners, the outcast, and those “sinless
     Cains” of history, those men who had lived to do good
     <pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7083-059"/> to their generation, and who had been stoned and crucified
     and blasphemed and cursed as their reward—they were all clustered closely round him. He had
     nothing to do with that regal Society, that mitred Christianity. He loudly proclaimed his
     antagonism to both, and drew to him only such as they spurned and rejected.</p>
    <p>He pointed to the high priest: “Look,” he said to Joshua, “what they have made of me; of an
     unskilled artisan, no schoolman even of his day, and a vagrant preacher living by charity, they
     have made a king; of a man, a god; of a preacher of universal tolerance, the head of a
     persecuting religion; of a life, a dogma; of an example, a church. Here am I, Jesus the
     Nazarene, the son of Joseph and Mary, as I lived on earth; poor, unlearned, a plebeian, and a
     socialist, at war
     <pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7083-060"/> with the gentlemen and ladies of my society, the enemy of
     forms, of creeds, of the priestly class of respectabilities; and there you see my modern
     travesty, this jewelled, ornate, exclusive Ecclesiastical Christianity, who is the ancient
     Pharisee revived. To you, and to such as you, is given the task of bringing men back to the
     creed that I preached. And if in securing the essence of the creed you forget the Founder, and
     call my doctrine by another name than mine, so be it. The world wants the thing, not the label;
     and Christ-likeness, not Ecclesiastical Christianity, is the best Saviour of men.”</p>
    <p>As he said this the whole vision seemed to fade away, and the voice of Peggy Bray, whining
     and drunk, with Mr. Grand's deep tones of angry disgust, broke the quiet
     <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7083-061"/> evening stillness, and brought Joshua back to the realities
     of life.</p>
    <p>“Something seemed to bid me,” he said, when he told me the story: “I ran off over the down as
     fast as I could, and caught Peggy on the Tintagel Road. She was drunk, dirty, and crying. I
     took her by the hand. ‘Peggy, woman,’ I said, ‘dry your eyes, and come along with me.’ I spoke
     so sudden, I startled her, and so a little sobered her. Then I took her by the arm and led her
     to mother's cottage. ‘Here, mother,’ I said; ‘here is a bit of Christ-work for you to do. Take
     this poor creature, in her dirt and vileness as she is, and cleanse her. You believe and know
     that God's love did that for the world: we are less pure than Christ, but we hold ourselves too
     fine to follow His example in that! Love her,
     <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7083-062"/> mother; she is your sister—and maybe your love can heal her.’
     Poor mother! she didn't like the task. She cried over it, and said that I put a burden on her
     she could not bear; but I held to my point,” said Joshua, with a glowing face; “and she
     yielded. Peggy stayed in our house for over a month, and mother was ill-called for her work.
     Not that she much cared, I fancy. I don't know, however, whether she did or not; she never said
     much. And though Peggy broke out again and went to the bad as before, yet a month's experience
     of loving-kindness and cleanly living was something. At all events, it was practical
     Christianity; and if it did Peggy herself little or no good permanently, it was the right thing
     to do, and mother was so far benefited.”</p>

    <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7083-063"/>
    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
    <p>IN London a new view of life opened to Joshua altogether. The first thing that
     struck him in our workshop was the avowed infidelity of the workmen, with the indifference so
     many of them showed for any spiritual life at all. Having apparently made up their minds that
     Christianity, as taught by the churches and practised in high places, is a humbug throughout,
     they seemed to have stopped there, not caring to go farther, nor to find a truer and better
     religion for themselves. Distrust had penetrated to their inmost
     <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7083-064"/> most souls, and God was abandoned because man had betrayed
     them. Some of the better class among them had become Unitarians; which gave them the most
     religion with the least dogma of all the sects that go by the name of Christian; and some had
     transferred their whole passion and life of thought and intellectual energy to science, finding
     that consolation in nature which they could not get from revelation. But very few were what is
     called religious men: that is, men believing in the Bible, going to church on Sundays, and
     reverencing the clergy as men placed over them by a higher power to guide their souls as they
     would.</p>
    <p>The immense gulf existing between the church and the workmen also surprised the Cornish lad.
     At home, though the cottagers and the clergy stood as wide as the poles
     <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7083-065"/> apart, socially and intellectually, yet there was some kind
     of mutual knowledge and intercourse; which, if it meant little for human wants and less for
     spiritual needs, still was intercourse and knowledge. In London there was none; or so little in
     proportion to the work to be done, it seemed almost as good as none. The parish priest, save in
     some chiefly ritualistic exceptions, scarcely exists, and his place is supplied by all sorts of
     lieutenants, both authorised and irregular; by Bible women, the City missionaries, Baptists,
     Roman Catholics, and the thousand and one odd, obscure sectaries of whom no one in good society
     ever heard the names—anything rather than the fashionable preacher who has invested all his
     store of godliness in his sermons, or the beneficed clergyman who thinks his East-end
     <pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7083-066"/> income dearly bought at the price of his East-end
     residence.</p>
    <p>As he grew however, to understand the inner relations of life in the metropolis, he ceased to
     wonder at the wide-spread indifferentism of the working men; and he came further to understand
     how religion, like other things, had followed that class antagonism felt by the artisan, to
     which the exclusiveness of caste cherished by the rich had given birth. Christianity represents
     to the poor, not Christ tender to the sinful, visiting the leprous, the brother of publicans,
     at whose feet sat the harlots and were comforted, but the bishop in his palace and the parson
     in his grand house, the gentleman taking sides with God against the poor and oppressed, as an
     elder brother in the courts of heaven kicking the younger out of doors. It is in
     <pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7083-067"/> fact, he used to say, antagonism not love; Cain not
     Christ.</p>
    <p>His religious experiences followed the natural course of such a mind as his, at once so
     earnest and so logical. Attracted by the self-sacrificing lives of so many of the Ritualist
     party, he threw himself with ardour into the congregation of a noted City priest whose name I
     do not feel justified in giving, as I have not asked his consent. If, however, he should read
     these pages he will remember Joshua Davidson well enough. The Superior, as he was called, took
     to him greatly, and Joshua felt all the charm of close intercourse with a cultivated mind. It
     was the first time this great good had been granted him, and it was like a new life to him. At
     one time I thought he would have abandoned the independent line he had
     <pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7083-068"/> chosen and would have gone over to the High Church party; but
     I do not think now that he was ever very near. For, fascinated as he was with the earnestness
     and culture of the Superior and his colleagues, they failed to hold him mainly because of the
     largeness of their assertions, the smallness of their proofs, and the feeling he had that more
     lay behind their position than they acknowledged, and that they used their adherents as tools.
     Added to which, their devotion to the Church rather than to Christianity at large, the
     absorption of the human example of Christ in His mystical character, the deification of the man
     as He lived, as if He had walked about like a God with a halo round His head, and was not a
     real man of the people of his time—of lowly birth, of confessed scientific ignorance, in
     antagonism to all the wealth and
     <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7083-069"/> culture, and class-refinement and political economy of His
     day, fighting the cause of the poor against the rich, of the outcast against the aristocrats,
     just as any earnest democrat, any single-hearted communist, might be doing at the present
     day—all this repelled him from close union; and all this made him feel that, great and good as
     the men themselves are, in the High Church movement was not his Shekinah. Then again, their
     elaborate system of symbolism seemed to him puerile; a playing with spiritual toys that had
     less reality than ingenuity; and their central creed of sacrifice rather than commemoration in
     the Eucharist, backed by their assumption of a priesthood possessing unproved and mysterious
     powers, failed to convince him.</p>
    <p>“You have captivated my heart,” he one
     <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7083-070"/> day said to the Superior—“you charm my tastes—you delight my
     imagination; but you have not mastered my reason. Fairly reasoned out I do not think your
     position is tenable. You are Roman Catholics under another name; irregulars claiming to be
     received on the footing of the acknowledged Body Guard; you are infallible yet eclectic, and I
     cannot concede infallibility to eclecticism.”</p>
    <p>“But have you no reverence for the virtues of obedience and humility?” asked the Superior.
     “Cannot you quell that questioning spirit of yours for the sake of the Church's honour, and to
     maintain a close front? Who can hope to do anything as an isolated unit against a host? Is not
     the whole secret of strength in organisation?”</p>
    <p>“But I cannot become part of a system
     <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7083-071"/> for expediency!” said Joshua mournfully. “Some men may, but
     it is not given to me to be able to stifle my own individual conscience for any considerations
     of party strength. I have got it to do—to find out if practical Christianity is possible in the
     world, and to learn why, being Christians, we are not of Christ. I know I should get something
     of the kind in such institutions as St. Vincent de Paul and the like, but I should have there
     so much in excess of the simple faith I love, that I cannot join them. I must go on my way
     alone.”</p>
    <p>“And you will fail,” said the Superior. “No one man can succeed in such a search as yours.
     Guided by wise counsels and supported by authority you might come to satisfactory conclusions;
     but adrift on the wide sea of dissent, and private opinion, and individual
     <pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7083-072"/> vidual interpretation, you are lost. To the Church came the
     promise and the Spirit; believe in the Church is your only ark.”</p>
    <p>“If any, then the Roman Catholic at once, frankly and without reserve,” said Joshua. “If the
     keys of life and death are held by a governing body, they are surely held within the Vatican;
     and if I must enter into the virtue of unquestioning obedience, I would rather accept it in its
     totality. Your ritualism seems to me like Canute and the waves. ‘Thus far and no farther,’ you
     say to private inquiry; and ‘only so much and so much will we take of tradition and the
     vitality of past ages.’ Where is your standing-point? where your logical foothold? By what
     authority do you reject and accept at will? and by what measure
     <pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7083-073"/> sure do you set the length of the tether of reason?”</p>
    <p>“If you are for the whole history of the Church you must read more closely than you have
     done,” said the Superior a little evasively.</p>
    <p>“Forgive me, sir,” continued Joshua earnestly; “I know you will, whatever I say; for I am
     speaking now heart-open, man to man, and there is no question of discourtesy or of courtesy;
     but with all my personal love and admiration for the professors of your creed, the creed itself
     is tainted with an insincerity I cannot digest. And your position, standing as you do in the
     front, between yearning souls demanding the support of authority, the moral protection of
     infallibility, and the only Western Church that can give it logically, is, to my
     <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7083-074"/> way of thinking, both dangerous to yourselves and cruel to
     the people. Why do you not go over to Rome at once, sir, since your commission is
     self-appointed and irregular?”</p>
    <p>The Superior smiled gently. “I never argue,” he said; “for I never found any good to come of
     it. These questions are matters for spiritual reception, not dialectical discussion. Use the
     appointed means and the grace of our Lord will find you.”</p>
    <p>“I have used them; I do use them; and yet I cannot get conviction,” Joshua made answer, as
     sorrowfully as frankly.</p>
    <p>“Persevere!” said the Superior solemnly; “the promises of God never failed yet.”</p>
    <p>Joshua did not speak. He remembered his trial of the material promises and how
     <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7083-075"/> they failed; but he did not go into that with the Superior.
     He had learnt to look back on the phase through which he had passed then as a boyish craze,
     sincere if you will, but a craze all the same. Yet it had struck into him, and, perhaps unknown
     to himself how much, had helped greatly to modify his views. It had broken down his belief in
     the literal exactness of the Scriptures, and the science-lectures he attended event the same
     way; and when one's childlike confidence has received its first shock, it is long before
     anything like an analogous faith is reconstructed out of more mature knowledge.</p>
    <p>At this time Joshua's mind was like an unpiloted vessel. He was beset with doubts, in which
     the only thing that kept its shape or place was the character of
     <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7083-076"/> Christ. For the rest, everything had failed him.</p>
    <p>“What,” he said to me at this time, “if the spiritual life is as little real as that act of
     faith in which we all failed?—if what we call conviction is only a state of the mind—a
     subjective condition owning no absolute without—a state as good and righteous for the Buddhist,
     for the Mohammedan, for the Hindoo, as for the various Christian denominations? We are all
     convinced. Every creed has had its martyrs and enthusiasts and its well-trained, well-balanced
     professors, all as firmly convinced of its truth and of its being the one truth only, as the
     Superior is convinced of the absolute rightness of Anglicanism, as the Pope believes in the
     infallibility of his Church, and the whole Christian world in
     <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7083-077"/> the impregnability of the Bible and its literal exactness. I
     cannot focus God as these men are able to do; and yet I feel it better to be rooted than
     wandering, as I am wandering now, unfixed and unnourished. If you are rooted you can grow; but
     floating, hovering, what is the soul but as one of those winged seeds carried about by the wind
     and fastened nowhere?”</p>
    <p>“And yet,” I answered, “it is better to be unfastened from a fallacy than to be rooted on it.
     There must be the moment of suspension when you are in progress. To mount a ladder you must
     leave the rung on which you stand, and before you have your foot on the other it is
     nowhere—only in space. The time of doubt is a time of pain, but it must be passed through if we
     would believe the better thing. To have lost the
     <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7083-078"/> old land-marks—left them behind us—is not necessarily to have
     lost the right way, Joshua!”</p>
    <p>“Ah! but to have been so near to God as I once felt myself—to have lived in the light—and now
     to be so far off—to be in darkness and alone!” he sighed.</p>
    <p>“The darkest hour is that before dawn,” was my reply. “Even at this moment God may be
     preparing you for conviction.”</p>
    <p>I do not think that what is called the Evangelical school ever warmed Joshua as the
     Ritualists had done. If the assumptions of the Church, clad in her venerable authority, seemed
     to him excessive, the assumptions of sectarianism, where each man is an independent pope and
     quite as bigoted as the real one, were more so. And he could
     <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7083-079"/> not come to believe that faith, which is a thing we cannot
     give ourselves, which will not come for the seeming, and which, when we have it, is as likely
     to lead us wrong as right—unless all beliefs are true alike; which sectarianism does not
     admit—is the one sole means of salvation, without which we are lost. It seemed to him a theory
     entangled in contradictions. Faith is the gift of God; no one can believe at will, but only as
     God gives him grace to do so; but if you do not believe you are damned, and God punishes you
     for not having what He will not bestow. Again, you have to distinguish between your various
     kinds of faith, and you must discern accurately which kind is sent by God and which by the
     devil. No outward test can tell you: for the Calvinist holds the Romanist in deadly error; the
     Romanist damns
     <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7083-080"/> the heretic with no hope of mercy; the Anglican talks about
     the deadly sin of dissent; and not one of them all regards the Unitarian, the Jew, or the
     Pagan, as in any sort of possibility a child of God, or as aught but a confirmed, if
     unconscious, son of the devil. What known test then can be applied to all these conflicting
     schools? To Joshua's mind, none; and the more he sought for the unerring truth—truth
     centralised, unified, focussed—the less, it seemed to him, he found it, and the more dignity
     and grandeur and charity he felt resided in the wide creed of Universalism.</p>
    <p>During this time he did not neglect what I suppose may be called secular life. He attended
     all such science-classes as he had time for; and being naturally quick in study, he picked up a
     vast deal of knowledge in a
     <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7083-081"/> very short time; he interested himself in politics, in
     current social questions, specially those relating to labour and capital, and in the condition
     of the poor. This, above all, was his main subject; and perhaps more than any thing else, the
     fact that all the sects and denominations he had searched into accepted the class divisions of
     the present time as final, and thought that it was enough to preach the Gospel to the poor—that
     is, to preach to them submission and patience, and belief that Christ was God, and then leave
     them to their physical wretchedness and social degradation as to things that must be, and with
     which they must make themselves content—had turned him from communion with them, one and all.
     It was such a comfortable way of getting rid of a difficulty, he used to say. It
     <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7083-082"/> was offering a potential heaven as a bribe to induce the
     starving and the down-trodden to be patient with their sufferings, and submissive to the unjust
     tyranny of circumstances. It was shirking the question of Christian equality altogether, and
     nullifying the whole teaching and tendency of Christ's life.</p>
    <p>So his time passed, and his thoughts went more and more into the rationalistic channel; till
     at last one evening, when I and other of his friends were sitting with him, he made his
     declaration.</p>
    <p>“Friends,” he said, “I have at last cleared my mind and come to a Belief. I have proved to
     myself the sole meaning of Christ; it is Humanity. I relinquish the miracles, the doctrine of
     the Atonement, the doctrine of the Divinity of Jesus, and the
     <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7083-083"/> unelastic finality of His knowledge. He was the product of
     His time; and if He went beyond it in some things, He was only abreast of it in others. His
     views of human life were oriental; His images are drawn from the autocratic despotism of the
     great and the slavish submission of the humble, and there is never a word of reprobation of
     these conditions, as conditions, only of the individuals according to their desert. He did His
     best to remedy that injustice, so far as there might be solace in thought, by proclaiming the
     spiritual equality of all men, and the greater value of worth than status; but He left the
     social question where he found it—paying tribute even to Cæsar without reluctance—His mind not
     being ripe to accept the idea of a radical revolution, and His hands not strong enough to
     accomplish it, if even
     <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7083-084"/> He had imagined it. But neither He nor His disciples imagined
     more than the communism of their own sect; they did not touch the throne of Cæsar, or the power
     of the hereditary irresponsible Lord. Their communism never aimed at the equalization of
     classes throughout all society. Hence, I cannot accept the beginning of Christian politics as
     final, but hold that we have to carry on the work under different forms. The modern Christ
     would be a politician. His aim would be to raise the whole platform of society, he would not
     try to make the poor contented with a lot in which they cannot be much better than savages or
     brutes. He would work at the destruction of caste, which is the vice at the root of all our
     creeds and institutions. He would not content himself with denouncing sin as merely spiritual
     evil; he
     <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7083-085"/> would go into its economic causes, and destroy the flower by
     cutting at the roots—poverty and ignorance. He would accept the truths of science, and he would
     teach that a man saves his own soul best by helping his neighbour. That, indeed, He did teach;
     and that is the one solid foothold I have. Friends, Christianity according to Christ is the
     creed of human progress, not that of resignation to the avoidable miseries of class; it is the
     confession that society is elastic, and that no social arrangements are final; that morals
     themselves are only experimental, and that no laws are divine—that is, absolute and
     unchangeable by circumstance. It is the doctrine of evolution, of growth; and just as Christ
     was the starting-point of a new era of theological thought, so is the present the
     starting-point of a new era of social fact.
     <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7083-086"/> Let us then strip our Christianity of all the mythology, the
     fetichism that has grown about it. Let us abandon the idolatry with which we have obscured the
     meaning of the Life; let us go back to the MAN, and carry on His work in its essential spirit
     in the direction suited to our times and social conditions. Those of you who still cling to the
     mystical aspect of the creed, and who prefer to worship the God rather than imitate the Man,
     must here part company with me. You know that, as a youth, I went deep into the life of prayer
     and faith; as a man, I have come out into the upper air of action; into the understanding that
     Christianity is not a creed as dogmatised by churches, but an organization having politics for
     its means and the equalization of classes as its end. It is Communism. Friends! the doctrine
     <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7083-087"/> trine I have chosen for myself is Christian Communism—and my
     aim will be, the Life after Christ in the service of humanity, without distinction of persons
     or morals. The Man Jesus is my master, and by His example I will walk.”</p>

    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
    <p>THESE then were the stages through which Joshua's mind had passed; first, literal
     acceptance of the Word, which as he went on he found to be against the laws of nature, and
     which therefore he relegated to the ignorance and exaggeration of the time in which it was
     written; next, the authority of the Church with its increment of symbolism and tradition, by
     which the Humanity of Jesus is resolved into a mystical Appearance of Divinity, and his Life
     made no longer an example for men to follow but a dogma to
     <pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7083-089"/> be worshipped under emblems; and now the frank acceptance of
     that Humanity alone, of the Man as a teacher, and of the Life as an example to be faithfully
     followed; more especially in its tenderness to sinners and its brotherhood with the poor and
     outcast. It was an abandonment of the dead mystical for the living real; but I doubt if any
     single sect among all the hundreds into which the Christianity of Jesus is shredded, would have
     recognised him as a brother Christian, or have believed that Christ would do aught else to him
     in the Last Day but deny him as a “thief and a robber.”</p>
    <p>And now Joshua began to carry out his programme of life with more fixed lines. He disdained
     nothing that could advance him in knowledge and intellectual strength: and I have often heard
     him say that the
     <pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7083-090"/> great marvels of science, such as were shown us in the
     lectures to working men that we attended, stirred his soul to religious feeling just like the
     passion of prayer. And what he knew and valued for himself, that he was eager to impart to
     others. And it was this which made him begin his “night school,” where he got together all who
     would come, and tried to interest them in some of the more taking “fairy tales of science,” as
     well as to teach them a few homely truths in the way of cleanliness, health, good cooking, and
     the like; with interludes, so to speak, of lessons in morality; winding up with a few simple
     prayers and an attempt to make his hearers feel the Presence and the Power of God. All came to
     this meeting who would; thieves and drunkards, lost women and gutter-children—no matter who:
     there was a
     <pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7083-091"/> kindly welcome for all; no preaching at them for their sins;
     no expression of spiritual or moral superiority, but just the great loving equality which does
     the degraded so much good, and gives them, if only for a moment, a flash of natural
     self-respect and the glorious sense of inclusion and brotherhood. So that you see his life was
     not a meagre one; and while he blessed others so far as his power went, he grew daily riper in
     his own thoughts, and fuller of knowledge, and more clear as to what he meant.</p>
    <p>We were very poor all this time: that of course we understood we must be. We were accustomed
     to it, and would have been more embarrassed with a lot of surplus money to spend, if we had had
     to spend it on ourselves, than we were to make the best of the little we
     <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7083-092"/> possessed. But we did look to live like decent men, and not
     like savages. And we desired the same for our order. Yet how was that possible in the
     conditions in which we found ourselves? And we were only two out of thousands.</p>
    <p>We lodged in a stifling court, Church-court, where every room was filled as if cubic inches
     were gold, as indeed they are to London house-owners, if human life is but dross. Children
     swarmed like rabbits in every house, and died like sheep with the rot. It was sore to see them,
     poor little, pale, stunted, half-naked creatures, playing about the foul uncleansed pavement of
     the court, from the reeking gutter of which they picked up apple-parings, potato-peelings,
     fish-heads, and the like, which I have seen them many a time wipe on their rags
     <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7083-093"/> and eat. “The bronchitis” it was called that sent so many of
     them to the hospital and the graveyard, but the real word was poverty: poverty in everything;
     in food, in clothing, in care, in lodging. It made one's heart ache to see them—them and their
     parents too: the hopeless misery of their lives and the moral degradation following. And it
     made one think with deep amazement of what the wisdom of that nation could be which leaves its
     riches to rot in the gutter for want of looking after and tending; not to speak of the
     religion, which contents itself with building churches, and endowing foreign and colonial
     bishoprics, while its own immortal souls perish for lack of the Bread of Life squandered in
     baskets full on the altars to Baal! Where to find the issue? How to fill up the great chasm
     between the
     <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7083-094"/> rich and the poor, the virtuous and the vicious, the learned
     and the ignorant, the civilised and the brutish?</p>
    <p>“There is only one way out of it,” said a noted M.P. to Joshua one day, a great political
     economist and a strict Malthusian: “abstinence; if you wish to see the poor raised you must
     lighten the labour market by bringing fewer labourers into it. That is the first necessity.
     Leave off having children, live frugally, and put by money, and as many of you can,
     emigrate.”</p>
    <p>“Is this not omitting one important factor from your calculations, sir?” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“What do you mean?” asked Mr. —</p>
    <p>“Merely the human nature there is in humanity,” said Joshua. “Do you think the poor have no
     instincts? Is not a wife
     <pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7083-095"/> or a husband, a home where there are little children,
     sometimes a day's pleasure, and the old family ties of father and mother and brothers and
     sisters—are not all these as dear to them as to the rich? Why should they be required to forego
     these that the rich not be called upon to share?”</p>
    <p>“Would you destroy the existing order of society?” said the M.P. sternly.</p>
    <p>“Destroy it? aye! root and branch, if need be! In no civilised community—not to speak of a
     Christian one, if Christianity meant anything—ought there to be such places as Belgrave-square
     and Church-court. Keep your Belgrave-square by all means, but let the Church-courts be made at
     least wholesome and decent.”</p>
    <p>“You have the remedy in your own hands,” said the M.P. “So long as you
     <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7083-096"/> will marry on nothing, spend all you get, and breed paupers,
     paupers you must remain, wallowing in filth and wretchedness. The whole question is as much a
     matter of exact science as any other mathematical problem; and you are to blame, Davidson, that
     you do not abandon your foolish rant about Christian charity and human rights, and apply
     yourself to the only way out of the difficulty—the science of Political Economy.”</p>
    <p>Joshua smiled sadly. “Political Economy is not quite human enough for us, sir,” he said. “It
     rests too on the basis of these very existing conditions of society that I do not care for; I
     would rather see something more radical, going straight to the root of the evil.”</p>
    <p>“You are an enthusiast,” said the M.P. coldly. “I tell you again, Political Economy
     <pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7083-097"/> does go to the root of the evil; and the only thing that
     does.”</p>
    <p>“Then Christianity is wrong,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>And the M.P. was silent. He had never confessed himself on the subject of religion, and never
     would. Not his most intimate friends knew what he believed or what he did not believe. All that
     the world saw was that he went to church, made the orthodox bow at the Name in the Creed, and
     wrote books and pamphlets full of anti-Christian, hard-headed doctrines, without ever once
     alluding to religious dogma. When he was called an infidel by his foes he hit out savagely, and
     said, “Prove it.” And no man could: only every man felt that his whole teaching, from first to
     last, was absolutely devoid of all Christian feeling; that pity, charity, warmth, and love
     <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7083-098"/> were as far from him as heaven is from the earth; and that he
     squared the accounts of humanity with the most sublime unconsciousness that such disturbing
     elements as passions or the sentiment of rights existed to upset his sums and prove his
     sociology for the present at least imperfect.</p>
    <p>And the result of the conversation was, that Mr. —, the M.P., who is a worthy man, upright
     and honourable, but practically one-sided because so utterly undisturbed by weakness or
     passions of any kind, and therefore unable to allow for them in another, denounced Joshua as a
     mischievous agitator and an ignorant fanatic, and warned those of us whom he knew to beware of
     him. Yet Mr. — was as hearty as Joshua himself in his desire to see the regeneration of the
     working class: but as Joshua said, and I
     <pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7083-099"/> thought said well too; “He advocates our making ourselves so
     slender that we can slip through our bands and fetters, while I hold that we should make
     ourselves strong enough to force those who hold the fastenings to loosen them. We both mean the
     same thing in the end, liberty and social advancement; but we differ as to the means.”</p>
    <p>Our court was one of just ordinary moral character, neither strictly respectable nor the
     reverse. We had all sorts; from the man who would harbour a pal in trouble and stow away swag
     not honestly come by till the police scent grew cold, to the decent workman doing his best to
     be respectable, and to keep his girls pure and his boys honest; from the hard working-woman
     slaving night and day to make her two poor ends meet, to the idle slattern who was drunk
     <pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7083-100"/> half her time, and begged in the streets the other half; from
     the fond mother with her pretty pride in Sunday frocks or bits of coloured bows, to the
     husbandless wench whose half-starved children, as naked as crows and nearly as black, were
     knocked about as if they were street dogs, and on the highway to the gallows through neglect;
     from the virtuous spinster proud of her character and intolerant of looseness, to the poor
     flaunting girl who got her living in the streets, leastwise eked out her scanty wages from
     slopwork and the like by prostitution, more or less avowed.</p>
    <p>One of these girls lived just opposite to us. Her name was Mary Prinsep. He had seen her at a
     music-hall we went to by times: for Joshua was not one of those prudes who are afraid of appearances
     <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7083-101"/> pearances, and as he wanted to learn the world on all sides
     he went to all sorts of places and talked to all sorts of people—to these poor girls, as well
     as to any one else, and just as he would to any one else; seeking to know the causes of things,
     and why they went on to the streets, and if they would keep out of them if they could, and so
     on.</p>
    <p>Any one who knows anything about us working men as we are and not by fancy portraits, knows
     the profound contempt, and more, in which as a class we hold the professed prostitute, or the
     woman of our own homes who lets herself be seduced by a gentleman. A base child—nay, more than
     one, and by different fathers too—if by men of our own class is not so unpardonable an offence.
     We think it a pity, of course and
     <pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7083-102"/> we would rather not have it happen to our daughters and
     sisters; but we get over it; and the women not unfrequently marry, and marry well, when the
     thing has blown by a little. But the poor, painted, bedizened wreck of womanhood who goes about
     the streets at the West-end, and sells herself to club-gentlemen and the like, is of all things
     that of which we have the most abhorrence. I don't pretend to explain it, and very likely it is
     only a matter of class jealousy when all is said and done; but I mention it as a kind of
     introduction to what I have to say of Mary Prinsep. I want it to be seen that it was no
     indifferentism to her trade which actuated Joshua; but, on the contrary, that it was the large
     and generous humanity in him which made him able to accept even a streetwalker as his sister
     and his friend.</p>
    <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7083-103"/>
    <p>Mary was very young and very ignorant. She had been brought up any how, and had been
     neglected and untaught from the beginning. There was no romantic history attached to her. She
     was no “soiled dove” whose feathers had once been white and shining; she was the daughter of a
     dram-drinking charwoman, sent out to mind children when quite a child herself, brought up to no
     trade, and knowing nothing now but the streets and the music-halls. But she had so much to the
     good, that she did not drink—at least not much—they all drink some; and she had never been in
     trouble or locked up. She was merely one of the abandoned—abandoned by society from her birth,
     and left to sink or swim in the foul streams of the metropolis as she best could. She had been
     picked up by a gentleman a
     <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7083-104"/> few years ago when she was about fifteen; and he had taught
     her a good deal both of refinement and womanly ways. She had been grateful to him at the time,
     but she scarcely loved him. He was older than herself; in fact, an old man comparatively;
     married, with grown-up daughters and sons, a churchwarden, and a fine Christian gentleman
     living out at Bayswater in the very odour of class respectability. But he had an eye for pretty
     girls; and he had placed Mary in a little house at Bow, where, as I said, she had learned some
     things that were useful to her, being a girl of great natural quickness, and, if she had had
     fair play, of refined taste and good disposition. In time he got tired of her. Such men always
     do: for what was there in an ignorant girl like to keep him when he had had enough of
     <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7083-105"/> her beauty? So, making her a handsome present—oh! he behaved
     to her quite handsomely!—he parted with her, and Mary had to turn out into the streets with a
     ruined character and a taste for good living. She had learned however, during her two or three
     years of “protection,” to keep herself and her place tidy, and to do needlework after a
     fashion, but not sufficiently well to keep her. Twelve hours a day of slop-work would not feed,
     clothe, and lodge her; flower-selling would not; but her youth and good looks would. So she
     sold them, as all she had to sell; and got bread of the devil's baking because she could not
     get it any way else.</p>
    <p>It was a bad life; and she felt it was. And it was a hard life too. Those who see these girls
     only in their show-hours, dressed in the height of the fashion and queening it
     <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7083-106"/> at night-houses and the like, have no idea of the
     wretchedness of the reality for the poorer kind; for there are classes even here. No wonder
     they take to drink, poor souls, suffering as they do—merciful Heaven, how they do suffer! And
     how some of them loathe their lives as they go on, and go down, and wish they had died before
     they took up the trade! Not that I say for an instant they go moaning about in eternal agonies
     of remorse or horror—human nature does not live at such high pressure; but a lot of them do
     hate their business nevertheless, when the drink is not in them and their vanity is not
     flattered.</p>
    <p>But—virtuous women will start at this—they look on themselves, like all the poor, as martyrs
     to society. They think that, as men and things are, they must be; that they
     <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7083-107"/> make the virtuous wife, the chaste maiden, possible. In
     their blind way they are vaguely conscious that the root of this fine flower of western
     civilisation, the rich monogamous Christian home, is planted in the filth of prostitution, and
     that to them is owing the “self-restraint,” so much admired in gentlemen who do not marry until
     they can afford to have a family, and so often offered as an example to us working men who love
     honestly one of our own sort, and do not as a rule go among these girls. And the more
     thoughtful of them, conscious of their economic uses, resent the opprobrium dealt out to them,
     and pity themselves angrily as victims rather than criminals, the scapegoats not the polluters
     of society.</p>
    <p>To be sure, they do not fret at the scorn of the great ladies whom they help to keep
     <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7083-108"/> virtuous, for they have their compensations. Fine ladies
     think that because they would not brush skirts with a prostitute, therefore no one will, and
     that all life shows them the same aspect of repulsion and horror. It is nothing of the kind.
     Decent women of the poorer class, consort with them, if not cordially yet humanely; then they
     have friends of their own sort, and many of them; and we know that a multitude of evil doers
     makes the evil done seem light to each. The gentlemen who go with them are often kind and
     playful, and no more brutal than most men are to most woman outside the artificial restraints
     of society. Sometimes, of course, they are vile enough; but these are the men who would be
     brutal to their own lady-wives and daughters. So that the poor Girls, as they call themselves,
     are not
     <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7083-109"/> quite shut out from all human sympathy like the lepers of
     old—though indeed the circle is terribly narrowed! And though many of them have fits of
     self-loathing and regret, others take matters more coolly, and look on their profession as a
     legitimate trade, as lawful as a publican's who sells the gin that robs a man's family of
     bread, and makes him perhaps a murderer as well as a madman.</p>
    <p>Mary Prinsep was what the world calls lost—a bad girl—a castaway—but she might have been a
     saint for the natural virtue that was in her. I have reason to speak well of her, for to her we
     owe the life of Joshua.</p>
    <p>Soon after we came to know her, Joshua fell ill in our wretched lodgings where we lived and
     did for ourselves. He did not like to go to the hospital, nor did I like it for
     <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7083-110"/> him. We both had a strong feeling against accepting the
     charity of society; so I said he should not go, and that I would work harder for him and myself
     too. But by my harder work—overtime, and the like—I was obliged to leave him for twelve hours
     and more at a stretch; and Mary Prinsep, whose “friend” had just left her to go into a west-end
     “dress-house,” poor wench! came over and nursed him, and kept him alive.</p>
    <p>She it was who made up the fire, cooked his broths and messes, gave him his medicine, washed
     his clothes, and kept him clean and comfortable. And when I came home from work, and found her
     there, with everything arranged so nicely and as only a woman can—Joshua's bed made and him
     settled for the night, and my own supper ready, and hot water for cleaning
     <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7083-111"/> myself—for we had but one room between us—as one of the
     great family of the frail, the suffering, I could not feel anything like virtuous horror of
     her. She was our sister—our sister of sorrow, of poverty, of affliction.</p>
    <p>Gladly would Joshua have lifted her out of her life into something purer and nobler. He was
     so poor himself with all he did and gave away, he had much ado to live on the leavings; and as
     for marrying, that was as unlikely as murder! So that he could neither put her into any way of
     business independently, nor give her a home that the world would not misjudge. We did what we
     could, however. I say <emph>we</emph> intentionally, as it makes the whole thing clear to those
     who are candid enough not to wilfully misunderstand. We helped her all we could, and she helped
     us. We worked for her
     <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7083-112"/> food, while she gave us her time and did our chores. And so
     in this way we made it unnecessary for her to continue her sad trade.</p>
    <p>This got us the name of associating with bad women; for it was said that we lived partly on
     her earnings; and made us to be shyly looked on by our shopmates. But Joshua's mind was set to
     do the thing that is right; and what men said against him, not understanding facts or motives,
     hurt him no more than that dogs should bark at shadows. That which is, not that which seems,
     nor what folks choose to say, was what he lived for; and Mary Prinsep was only a text and an
     occasion, like others.</p>
    <p>And even when, one day, the men fairly hooted him down and hustled him into the street, and
     me along with him, because
     <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7083-113"/> when he was chaffed savagely about “his girl” he answered
     them mildly enough; “Mates, did our great Master receive Mary Magdalene and all sinners, or did
     He not? And if He did—as you may find for yourselves—am <emph>I</emph> too pure to help
     them?”—He only said to me, wiping the mud from his torn coat; “You are not afraid, John? You'll
     go on the right way, whatever comes of it?”—and not a word even of impatience against those who
     had misused us, calling us “canters,” “white-livered hypocrites,” and worse words still. No, I
     was not afraid, I said. I would stand shoulder to shoulder with him through it all; and where
     he led, there would I follow, if we sunk up to our very necks in the slough of the world's
     reproach. And we were not far off.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
    <p>AMONG the rest of the doubtful characters with which our court abounded, was one Joe
     Traill, who had been in prison many a time for petty larceny and the like, but who, the last
     time he was had up, was convicted of burglary. However, he was out now on a ticket-of-leave,
     and fast going the way to get it cancelled, with a new score to the back of it. Respectability
     and the police were bent on elbowing poor Joe into the mire, which was only too much his
     natural element. He had been crotch deep in the mud from the earliest; a gutter child, in whose
     <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7083-115"/> very blood ran the hereditary taint; a thief, the son of
     thieves, the grandson of thieves; a thing of mud from head to heel, inside and out; dirty,
     dissipated, shiftless, and with no more moral principle in him than he had of education. His
     only morality indeed, was his cleverness in being able to break the law without being found
     out; and when he was most down on his luck, he was disposed to think most meanly of
     himself.</p>
    <p>He was one of those who stink in the nostrils of cleanly, civilised society, and who are its
     shame and secret sore. And cleanly, civilised society, not being able to make a good job of him
     as he stood, thrust him out of its sight, and tried to forget him behind the prison grating.
     There was no place for Joe in this great world of ours. There was no work for him to do,
     because he could do
     <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7083-116"/> none requiring any of the deftness got by practice; and if
     by chance he got a job anywhere, he lost it mysteriously in a day or so; and, double as he
     might, he found the dogs of detection too sharp for him.</p>
    <p>So he said to Joshua one night in his blithe way—poor Joe! he had not fibre enough in him to
     take even his misfortunes seriously!—that there was nothing for him but the old line along with
     his pals, making a running fight of it, now up now down, as his luck went.</p>
    <p>“We'll see if something better won't turn up,” said Joshua. “Burglary's a bad trade,
     Joe.”</p>
    <p>“Only one I've got at my fingers' ends, governor,” laughed the thief; “and starvation is a
     worse go than quod.”</p>
    <p>“Well, till you've learned a better, share
     <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7083-117"/> with us,” said Joshua. “If we have no widow's cruse—”
     “Blowed if I know what that means!” put in Joe, “—we have what does as well,” continued Joshua;
     “and it's better for four to go short than for one to be rationed at the hulks.”</p>
    <p>So now our little home circle was increased by one more; and we had added a burglar to the
     prostitute.</p>
    <p>“It is what Christ would have done,” said Joshua, when he was remonstrated with. “He lived
     among the lepers whom no man would touch, and whose very presence was pollution. But he healed
     some among them; and so will I these.”</p>
    <p>But the police did not see it. They do not understand practical Christianity in
     Scotland-yard, save as a generous kind of fad or pastime in a swell with more money
     <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7083-118"/> than brains, and a lot of idle time on his hands. And then
     they laugh at it behind backs, and ridicule him for being green. But when it came to a poor
     journeyman carpenter housing a jail-bird, and consorting with bad characters daily, they had
     but one conclusion to come to—the carpenter was no better than his company. Wherefore, “from
     information received,” Joshua and I, who had long been looked on askance by our mates as I
     said, were called up before the master, and had our dismissal from the shop. His other men, he
     said, objected to us; and, by the Lord, from all he had been told he did not wonder at it! And
     he gave us a caution—kindly meant, if harshly said—not to keep such company as we did, if we
     wanted to be respected by master or mate, and to remember that “birds of a
     <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7083-119"/> feather flock together,” and if we chose such birds as he
     was told we did, we could look for nothing else than to be classed along, with them. On which
     he paid us our week's wages, and we found ourselves next thing to penniless in the wilds of
     London.</p>
    <p>But Joshua was disturbed. He told both Joe and Mary, on the evening, we were discharged, that
     he would not forsake them come what might. It should still be share and share alike; only let
     them be of good courage and a clean conscience, and things would go well. How, nobody knew; but
     this is what he said, and promised.</p>
    <p>And Mary, looking up into his face with a look that made her like an angel—for indeed she was
     a pretty girl!—said, “If I have to starve, Joshua, I'll never go back to the streets again!”
     and poor Joe, first
     <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7083-120"/> laughing, and then sobbing like a woman, said, “You'd have
     done better to have left me to my little game, governor! I've brought you bad luck, you see;
     and I'm no good, you see, when you've done your best!”</p>
    <p>“Don't carry on like that, Joe,” said Joshua. “I shall have done something, if I save you
     both: and I will.”</p>
    <p>I could not help thinking that this “I will,” said with such manly courage, such deep
     religious firmness, was a greater trial of faith than the boyish exaltation in the Rocky Valley
     so many years ago; and that to save from the streets a girl who was not able to do anything,
     else that the world wants, and to put honesty and a clean name into such a poor conscienceless
     waif as Joe, were greater deeds than to cause a stone to
     <pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7083-121"/> move out of its place in the Name of the Lord.</p>
    <p>And all of us, his old Cornish friends who had come up to be near him, and some new friends
     he had made in London, swore we would never desert him, but would stand by him to the last. For
     we looked that he should do something in his day, as I said before—something to advance the
     world, and towards the solution of the great questions perplexing society at this moment. True,
     we were a poor, moneyless lot—all working men, no science among us, no political power, no
     social status, no political-economy knowledge of the right sort; a handful of enthusiasts set
     out to realise Christ at one time by faith, and now by works. But we had a soul among us—a
     leader in whom we believed; and we trusted in ourselves. And
     <pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7083-122"/> one by one we all got to work again somehow, and floated in
     the shallow but sufficient water to which we were accustomed. But it was a hard time; and, bit
     by bit, everything we possessed passed over the pawnbroker's counter, even to our tools. And
     when they went, it seemed as if all hope had gone.</p>
    <p>But when we were at the worst, and things looked as though they had given over all thought of
     mending—for we were getting whersh and weak for want of food—Joshua received a letter enclosing
     a five-pound note, “from a friend.” We never knew where it came from, and there was no clue by
     which we could guess. It was very certain that neither had Mary earned it in the old way, nor
     had Joe stolen it; but who sent it remained for ever a mystery. I always thought
     <pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7083-123"/> that Mary had had a hand in it, and I think so to this day.
     I believe, though I don't know, that she borrowed it of an artist to whom she went to sit for a
     model; for she did not make any secret of this; and that she paid it back honestly when we were
     in funds again. However that might be, it came at the very nick of time; and immediately after,
     both Joshua and I got the offer of a job at Messrs. — in Curtain-road, which we could not have
     accepted had we not had money wherewith to take our tools out of pawn. It was a sharp pinch
     while it lasted, but, God be praised, it passed without doing real harm to any one. And Joe and
     Mary still bided with us.</p>
    <p>By this time Joshua's strange doings in Church-court had got known to some of the gentlemen
     who practise philanthropy. His
     <pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7083-124"/> night-school for those who would learn either prayer or
     secular knowledge of him—his charity dinners, when he could get enough money together to give
     them—his goodness to the children, to the lost, to the starving—all this had got wind; and just
     as he wanted help most, the news of his doings brought him the famous Mr. C. anxious to know
     how a man like him could carry on charities, apparently on nothing, which cost himself a large
     income to keep up.</p>
    <p>He was a good man, this Mr. C.; up to his lights, none better; but his lights were few and
     feeble, and he drew a line hard and fast where Joshua did not. His line was respectability. He
     distinctly refused to aid those who were hopeless paupers, or those of bad repute. He would
     help respectable poverty, and help it substantially though always
     <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7083-125"/> afraid of overdoing it and inducing a habit of reliance on
     extraneous aid; but beasted, shiftless, drunken poverty—poverty that lied and whined and drank
     gin and got relief from half-a-dozen charities at once—poverty that was its own cause and that
     never stirred a hand to help itself—for this he had no pity, and to it gave no help.</p>
    <p>“To encourage pauperism” and “to offer a premium for vice” were the two things of which he
     was most afraid in his dealings with the poor; but he held out a helping hand gladly enough to
     the “deserving” and the “respectable” poor, and he was a warm patron of reformatories, refuges
     for soiled doves, and the like half-punitive places of retreat for sinful flesh, where they
     might repent of their evil past, and be made fit to
     <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7083-126"/> take up a lowly place among the respectable members of
     society once more;—but always, in a sense, a place of humiliation and penitent degradation.</p>
    <p>As he came along at this time, and was handy, and as Mary's friend, the artist, had gone to
     Italy for some months, and she had no other patron of the like kind, so was out of work as one
     may say, to him Joshua told the whole story of both her and Joe Traill; also how he had kept
     them in the best way he could from the evil to which society had driven them in former days: he
     did not add the rider of how society had revenged itself on him as on them, and cast us all out
     in company. But now, he said, he was desirous of placing them both where their <emph>temptation
      would be towards honesty</emph>; where it would be better for them to be
     <pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7083-127"/> honest, and where falling back would plunge them into misery
     as well as shame.</p>
    <p>Mr. C. listened attentively. He was evidently touched by the high spirit of the man, but he
     greatly questioned the wisdom of his ways. For Joe, he said, he scarcely knew what to propose.
     He shrank from committing himself to the patronage of a convicted thief, who was not a boy to
     be sent to a reformatory and disciplined into good ways. It was out of his line altogether, and
     he had no machinery at hand for him. Had he been a broken-down, sober, honest, and industrious
     chap, who had failed through sickness or any blameless misfortune, he would then have given him
     a lift willingly; but a man who had slipped into the dark ways of crime, who had got into
     houses at dead of night with a crowbar
     <pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7083-128"/> bar and a jimmy—he shook his head, and said he did not like
     to have anything to do with him. It was offering a premium to vice to take trouble to place
     this unsatisfactory waif and stray, when hundreds of honest men, who had never gone wrong, were
     perishing for want of aid.</p>
    <p>“As for that,” said Joshua, “I ask nothing, whether this man sinned or his parents; or
     neither. He is in want; and, to my way of thinking, his need is his claim, not his
     respectability.”</p>
    <p>Mr. C. looked dubious. “We must draw a line,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Christ drew it at the Pharisee,” answered Joshua simply.</p>
    <p>“To make no difference between vice and virtue—to treat the one as tenderly as the
     other—would soon be to obliterate all
     <pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7083-129"/> difference between them in minds as well as in practice,”
     said Mr. C.</p>
    <p>“And what, then, do we say to the parable of the men who worked unequally, and who got the
     same wages at the end?” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“My good fellow,” cried Mr. C. a little impatiently, “it would be perfectly impossible to try
     and live strictly after the Bible. ‘Counsels of perfection’ are all very well, but they are
     impracticable for the world as it is.”</p>
    <p>“I have to find that out yet,” said Joshua. “Then you will not help me with poor Joe?”</p>
    <p>“Do not say I will not—I cannot,” said Mr. C. “How can I ask my poor, honest pensioners, or
     my respectable workmen, to receive a convicted thief among them?”</p>
    <p>“‘And forgive us our trespasses, as we
     <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7083-130"/> forgive them that trespass against us.’ Does that mean only
     petty, personal affronts, sir, or does it mean trespass against our patience, our hope, our
     faith, our principles? Does it not mean the everlasting Love, whether we call it charity or
     humanity, by which we would raise the fallen and help the weak?”</p>
    <p>“As for that,” retorted Mr. C., “there are texts enough against consorting with evil. You
     cannot touch pitch, Mr. Davidson, without being defiled.”</p>
    <p>“Christ lodged in the house of Simon the leper. Mary Magdalene loved Him, and He her. I want
     no other example, sir. What the Master did, His followers and disciples may imitate!”</p>
    <p>“You are an enthusiast,” said Mr. C. just as the M.P. had said before him, and
     <pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7083-131"/> both meant that enthusiasm was ridiculous; “and some day
     these fine theories of yours will come to a cruel downfall. You will be harbouring some ruffian
     who will turn against you, and perhaps cut your throat for your pains. I tell you I know these
     people—they are incorrigible.”</p>
    <p>“Then what would you do with them, Mr. C.?”</p>
    <p>“You can do nothing with them!” he answered.</p>
    <p>“But they cannot be let to starve,” said Joshua earnestly.</p>
    <p>“I do not see that it is any one's duty to feed them, when they will not feed themselves save
     by vice and crime,” answered the philanthropist. “I would make all rogues, male and female,
     show some tangible signs of repentance and good living
     <pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7083-132"/> before I would help them or countenance them in any way.
     Believe me, your universal charity is the most disastrous line you could adopt.”</p>
    <p>“Then Christ was wrong,” said Joshua: “and so we have come round to our starting-point again.
     So this is decided—you will not give Joe Traill a trial?”</p>
    <p>“No; I would rather not have anything to do with him,” said Mr. C., who had talked himself
     cross and determined. “I should never be easy with the fellow. I have no fancy for burglars,
     and I don't believe in their reformation. All my men are picked men; not a loose character
     among them. I could not ask them to admit a convicted thief as one of them; and if I did, my
     own influence over them would be gone. It is because they know I
     <pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7083-133"/> would never pardon the smallest dereliction of duty that I
     keep them up to the mark: with what face then could I place among them such an unsatisfactory
     companion as your <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégé</foreign>? The thing would be impossible!
     With the woman perhaps I can do something. If she is young, she cannot be wholly hardened, and
     I could get her into the — Street Reformatory.”</p>
    <p>“No,” said Joshua, “I will not consent to her going into a reformatory. It is not that she
     needs. In a reformatory she will be continually reminded of what I want her to forget. She
     would be made morbid by incessant thought about herself; taught to say penitential psalms when
     she should be set to learn some skilled employment that would be of use to her in the future. I
     wish her to be kept virtuous through self-respect,
     <pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7083-134"/> and by being placed beyond the need of going back to such a
     life. I do not want her to be weakened by a self-torturing contrition for the past, or
     terrified at the prospect of eternal damnation for the future. I want her to be lifted up, not
     cast down.”</p>
    <p>“You surely do not make light of repentance!” cried Mr. C. warmly. “What other assurance have
     we that she will not fail again?”</p>
    <p>“The best assurance, sir, will be to teach her self-respect and the means of gaining an
     honest living,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“You are a rank materialist, Davidson!” said Mr. C. “I cannot stand your referring sin to
     mere social conditions. Are there no such things as sins in high places? Poverty and ignorance
     are not the only roots of human wickedness!”</p>
    <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7083-135"/>
    <p>“About the strongest though,” Joshua answered.</p>
    <p>“And the sins of luxury—”</p>
    <p>“Make Mary Prinsep and her class,” interrupted Joshua. “See here, sir, what are you asked to
     do?—to repair, in a very small way, the evil done by society. You represent society at this
     moment, and you are asked to undo a portion of your own bad work.”</p>
    <p>“Pshaw!” said Mr. C. “<emph>I</emph> have not made Mary bad!”</p>
    <p>He was an individual kind of man, and never saw beyond his own point.</p>
    <p>“Well,” he then said, “I will do what I can for the young woman. My wife wants an
     under-servant; I will put the case to her; but I rely on you,” he added, old habits of thought
     coming back to steady
     <pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7083-136"/> him in this sudden taking-off of his feet, as it were; “I
     rely on you that I am dealing with a woman substantially repentant, and so far purified; and
     that she will not corrupt the rest. For it is a dangerous experiment at the best.”</p>
    <p>“She is good enough for any one to trust and to love,” said Joshua warmly; and Mr. C. looked
     at him with a sharp, suspicious glance that quite changed his face. “And I thank you heartily,”
     Joshua went on to say, unconscious that he had caused the slightest discomfort in the
     gentleman's mind; “you have done a good work to-day—a work of brotherhood with Christ.”</p>
    <p>“I trust I am not doing wrong,” said Mr. C. doubtfully; “but it is against my principles, you
     know. I cannot help feeling
     <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7083-137"/> that I am rewarding a woman, because she has lived a life of
     infamy, with a position which hundreds of virtuous girls would be rejoiced to fill.”</p>
    <p>“If your economic conscience troubles you, sir, lay it at rest by the answer our Lord made to
     Himself, when He asked the Canaanitish woman if it were meet to cast the children's bread to
     dogs.”</p>
    <p>“For all that, I cannot think it a duty to reward vice,” persisted Mr. C. “And in doing what
     I am doing now, I wish it to be distinctly understood that it is at your instance.”</p>
    <p>“Which means that you refuse the responsibility?”</p>
    <p>“It does.”</p>
    <p>“So be it, sir. I accept it.”</p>
    <p>“That will not help me much if the thing
     <pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7083-138"/> turns out ill,” said Mr. C. in a discomposed voice.</p>
    <p>“Oh, sir, have faith in human nature!” said Joshua earnestly—so earnestly that I believe the
     tears were in his eyes: they were in his voice.</p>
    <p>“It is because I know human nature that I have so little faith in it,” said Mr. C. “Every one
     wants the help of strict moral principle to enable him to steer clear of the temptations so
     sure to beset him, and these fallen brothers and sisters are but leaky vessels at the best. If
     human nature was the grand thing you say it is, Mr. Davidson, of what need the coming of
     Christ? You are a Christian.”</p>
    <p>“And it is because Christ lived that I believe in humanity,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>On which, Mr. C. said, with a smile,
     <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7083-139"/> “There is no doing anything with you, Mr. Davidson; you are
     as unconvinceable as a woman,” shook hands with him kindly enough, and left.</p>
    <p>A day or two after this he came again, with many kind words, much regret and I doubt not
     genuine, but—his wife was as afraid of our poor Mary as he had been of Joe Traill, and refused
     to take her into her house. If the other servants should ever know; if Mary had imposed on
     Joshua, and was really of no good; if she should corrupt the younger ones; and then the repute
     of their house—the duty they owed their neighbours to keep up a stainless appearance. No, there
     could be no home for her there; but the lady sent a note, full of that half-censorious advice a
     virtuous woman knows so well how to administer to her fallen
     <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7083-140"/> sisters—a parcel of tracts (Mary could not read), and a
     renewal of her husband's offer to get her in the — Street Reformatory. After which perhaps some
     kind Christian person would be found to take her, she said, endorsed as she would then be by
     the Lady Superintendent of the establishment. For without casting any slur on Mr. Davidson, she
     went on to say, the voucher of only a young man was not quite satisfactory to a mistress who
     cared for the honour of her house. And perhaps she was right. But then Joshua was not like
     other young men; only she did not know this and Christians think it no sin to suspect all
     manner of evil of each other, unless they know for certain it does not exist.</p>
    <p>Well, it was a disappointment; but
     <pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7083-141"/> Joshua was not a man to be cast down for one blow or a
     dozen; so he set to work to find some one who would take her, knowing her past life; and at
     last lighted on a good, tender-hearted, but timid woman, who received her in full faith so far
     as the girl herself was concerned, but on the express condition that no one should ever know
     what she had been, and that there was to be no kind of communication between her and ourselves,
     or any of her old Church-court friends. To these terms Joshua advised her to submit; so with
     many tears poor Mary went away to take the place of kitchen-maid in a family living at a little
     distance from London, where, as the lady said, she had a chance now of redeeming herself, and a
     new start given her altogether.</p>
    <p>“And if I do well, Joshua, you will be
     <pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7083-142"/> pleased with me?” she said as she was bidding us
     good-by.</p>
    <p>“More than pleased, Mary,” he said. “You know that I trust you, and that we both love
     you—John here as well as I.”</p>
    <p>Mary's face was as white as the frill round her neck. “Joshua!” she said, looking up at him,
     “give me one kiss before I go; it will help me.”</p>
    <p>Joshua bent his noble head and kissed her tenderly.</p>
    <p>“God be with you, sister!” he said, and his voice a little failed him.</p>
    <p>“And I will say the prayer you taught me, Joshua, regularly morning and evening when I ain't
     too sleepy,” said Mary simply. “And you will pray for me too?”</p>
    <p>“As I do ever, my girl,” said Joshua: “and I believe that God hears us!”</p>
    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7083-143"/>
    <p>“Then He will hear me!” said Mary with a kindling face; “and I'll pray harder nor ever for
     the thing I want!”</p>
    <p>Poor Mary! prayer was naught but a “charm” to her as yet. She had never heard one, never
     offered one, till Joshua taught her the Lord's Prayer, with a childish hymn and a childish “God
     bless all I love” at the end; and she repeated what she had been taught as a young child might;
     believing that it did good because she had been told so by one she loved and trusted, but
     realising nothing more. Or if she realised anything, it was that she prayed to Joshua, grown
     very great and strong, and a long way off.</p>

    <pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7083-144"/>
    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
    <p>JOSHUA'S life of work and endeavour brought with it no reward of praise or
     popularity. It suffered the fate of all unsectarianism, and made him to be as one man in the
     midst of foes. Had he been a converted sinner like Ned Wright, preaching the doctrine of the
     Atonement, and Purification by the blood of Jesus, he would have had all the evangelical force
     at his back, pivoted as they are on the same hub, whatever their special denomination. Had he
     been a Ritualist, working under organised authority, he would have then been a pipe, so
     <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7083-145"/> to speak, through which flowed the power of the Church; and
     this much more had he been a Roman Catholic, and of any Order. Had he been a Unitarian, a
     stickler for respectability and that the poor he relieved should be deserving, like Mr. C. and
     the charity-organisation people; or a Political Economist, giving lectures on the law of supply
     and demand, and the immorality of large families; had he belonged to any body whatsoever, he
     would have been supported. But, as he was—a man working on the Christ plan, and that alone;
     dealing with Humanity by pity and love and tolerance—he was as stranger and an alien.</p>
    <p>The whole force of home missionaries of every denomination discountenanced him as an infidel,
     unsound, irregular; and in whatsoever they disagreed among themselves,
     <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7083-146"/> they all agreed in their ill estimate of him. The police
     were suspicious of him, and set him down as a doubtful character who harboured criminals; and
     the very people to whom he gave himself—accustomed as they were to be scouted by every man and
     woman pretending to clean hands and a pure life, or, at the best, to be preached at and urged
     to remorse—misdoubted him. The absence of abhorrence in his dealings with them looked to some
     like a trap, to others like encouragement. And yet they could scarcely think that!—with all his
     endeavours to put them into a better way of life, and to lift them out of the necessity of
     crime by giving them the alternative of honesty made possible, because giving them work
     sufficient for their daily wants.</p>
    <p>But he soon began to see that the utmost
     <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7083-147"/> he, or a dozen such as he, could do, was only palliative and
     temporary. He might save one out of a thousand, and he would do well if he did that; but what
     is one out of a thousand cleansed and set in a safe place, to the nine hundred and ninety-nine
     left in their filth at the bottom of the abyss? Things have gone too far in England now for
     private charities to be of much use. What is wanted is a thorough reorganisation of society, so
     that the distribution of wealth and knowledge shall not be so partial as it is. And this the
     working classes must get for themselves by combination.</p>
    <p>So Joshua turned to class-organisation as something more hopeful than private charity. But do
     not let me be misunderstood: he gave up nothing of his own personal doings among the poor, and
     never wearied nor relaxed
     <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7083-148"/> laxed. If he looked to organisation as the framework, he did
     not disdain charity as the enrichment, in the plan of social amelioration.</p>
    <p>When the International Working Men's Association was formed, he joined it as one of its first
     members; indeed he mainly helped to establish it. It had been one of his articles of belief
     long before any one else had spoken, that the time had passed for distinct and exclusive
     nationalities; and that if working men would free themselves from the fetters in which capital
     and caste have bound them, it must be by their own class-fraternisation all over the world. If
     labour is to make its own terms with capital, it must be by the coercive strength of the
     labourer. To wait for the free gift of the capitalist, through his recognition of human
     <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7083-149"/> duties, as some among the Comtists urge, would be to wait
     for the millennium. Yet the International represented no class enmity with him. He had no dream
     of barricades and high places taken by assault. It was to him, as to his other English
     brethren, an organisation to strengthen the hands of the labourer everywhere, but not to plunge
     society into a bloody war. It was a means of class-advancement by peaceable and noble efforts,
     not of universal destruction by violent or ignoble ones.</p>
    <p>The middle classes laugh at the artisan's desire to rise in the world, and speak of his close
     combinations as traitorous and rebellious to the existing order of things. Some think it an
     irreligious contempt of a caste-Providence; forgetting that their own order was made by the
     same determination
     <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7083-150"/> termination, and that the recognition of the merchant class,
     and its reception on anything like terms of equality, was forced from the nobles by men who had
     at heart the great truth of human equality and human rights; at least, down to that part of the
     social page where their own names stood. Below that paragraph where the artisan, the <foreign xml:lang="fre">prolétaire</foreign>, is to be found, society has as yet drawn a line not to be
     overpassed. Demand rights and recognition for working men, and even the Liberal press gives
     forth an uncertain sound, and the bugbear of “Jack Cade” scares such stout hearts as the
      <title>Pall Mall</title> and the <title>Spectator</title>. Even they, kings of liberal thought
     as they are in so many ways, will not see that the modern artisan stands in the same relation
     to capital as that in which the ancient serf stood to
     <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7083-151"/> the land. The serf tilled the land, which was his master's,
     for his master. If he could get for himself a living about as good as that of the hogs he
     forested, he had all that was considered necessary for a serf. And the artisan represents the
     serf of olden days, while capital is the foretime baron. The baron gave his villein disdainful
     leave to live because his life was so far requisite to his own needs; but individually he had
     neither rights nor value. So the capitalist. He gives his workmen only enough to keep them in
     efficient working order—or not that, if the labour market is so thronged that he can replace
     without trouble those who fall out. His “hands” are the mere parts of his machinery. The sum of
     them work to a certain result; but he is indifferent whether the work is done with sorrow and insufficiency
     <pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7083-152"/> ciency to the individual or not. His sole business is to see
     that the sum get through their labours creditably—to the firm. It is good that the work of the
     world should be done at all costs, even by compulsory labour if need be; but it is better that
     it should be done by men regarded as men, individual, and having inalienable rights, rather
     than as so many portions of a vitalised mechanism. And a fair and proportionate share in the
     profits of the business is part of the rights of the labourer.</p>
    <p>I am speaking now as if of myself; but I am only repeating what I have heard my friend say
     scores of times.</p>
    <p>Of course Joshua was an earnest Republican. Who that thinks for himself can fail to be one?
     Not that he would have put aside the reigning sovereign by force,
     <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7083-153"/> but he held that the times were ripening for the old
     monarchical symbol and aristocratic exclusiveness to disappear now that the reality had gone;
     and that the Republic would come about of itself, thanks, in great part, to the monarch who has
     shown the people that royalty can be dispensed with and yet things go none the worse for the
     withdrawal, and to the aristocracy which has abandoned its traditions of blood and birth, and
     has sold so many of its blue ribands to money. But he was not a Republican of the kind to rave
     and vilify, and accuse all the higher classes of wilful misdoing, of vice and selfishness, and
     what not. He never abused anybody, but judged things by their merits, and gave to the
     professors of any doctrine, no matter what, at least the credit of sincerity. By which he made
     <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7083-154"/> many enemies, and was constantly accused of lukewarmness to
     the cause, and of looking two ways at once.</p>
    <p>“You cannot beat me off my point,” he used to say, when he had put into an uproar a little
     inner and anonymous society which some few of us had formed together, by vindicating some man
     whose measures he also had attacked. “I say that we do our cause harm, and degrade ourselves,
     by all these childish personalities. What we have to do is, to defend our own principles, and
     show the fallacy or the evil of our opponents'; but we must fight fair, and give that credit
     for honesty of purpose which we demand for ourselves. If we are thieves and brigands to the
     governing classes, and they are thieves and brigands to us, what kind of understanding can we
     ever come to together?”</p>
    <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7083-155"/>
    <p>But L., one of those fanatical men who cannot accept the doctrine of an opponent's virtue,
     and whose zeal takes the form of the wildest abuse on all who differ from him, got up and
     denounced Joshua as an “inherent traitor,” and advised his expulsion from the society. And more
     than one of the council looked grave, and as if they were giving their minds to it, had not
     Félix Pyat risen, and given his opinion so forcibly that the malcontents were silenced. Even
     the thin-voiced little man who had denounced Joshua, and whose ambition was to be regarded as
     the Robespierre of the society—incorruptible, and not to be moved by fear or favour—even he had
     to give in. For Félix was our giant; and Félix loved Joshua.</p>
    <p>This was at the time when he was over
     <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7083-156"/> here as an exile, chiefly reading at the British Museum, and
     when he gained the love and admiration of all who knew him by the dignity, the devotion, the
     earnestness of his life. I mention this somewhat by the way, as my feeble protest against the
     terms in which it is the fashion to speak of one of the finest fellows that ever lived—as fine
     in his own way as Delescluze, our martyr,—and by those who ought to know better and who do know
     better; but who think it politic to swim with the stream, and to curse those whom fortune has
     not blessed.</p>
    <p>From his position in the International, and in other political societies—which abound among
     the working men more than the careless upper ten have the least idea of—Joshua was thrown into
     intimate relations with a great many men, more or less notorious
     <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7083-157"/> torious. He saw all sorts—the frothy ranter whose motive
     power was vanity; the reckless agitator whose conscience was obscured, and, so long as there
     was something stirring, cared nothing what stirred or who suffered; the bilious antagonist to
     all men superior to himself, and who would pull down those above to his own level but never
     raise up to it those who lay below; the honest patriot willing to sink all minor differences in
     the one great aim, and ready to sacrifice himself for the good of his cause and class, but
     blind as a beetle as to the best methods: he saw them all, and he accepted all with that broad
     human love, that large and liberal allowance of differences, which made the charm of his
     character.</p>
    <p>“They are good elements,” he used to say, “badly mixed. Does not some one say
     <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7083-158"/> that dirt is only matter in the wrong place? So these men as
     leaders would be pernicious enough, but a wise administration could utilise them. When Fourier
     could find an economic value in the <foreign xml:lang="fre">diablotin</foreign>, we need not
     fear for any one.”</p>
    <p>It was on this point that Joshua and the chief man of the London branch split. He was a
     purist, and gave his mind to tares. But Joshua thought more of the wheat, and believed in the
     larger power of good than of evil. He opposed all that narrow partisanship which goes only in
     one groove, and said, as the skilled workmen have lately said, that he would work with any one,
     no matter what his rank or politics, who would aid him and his order in securing the essentials
     for knowledge and decency of living. The more rabid and ultra of the politicians
     <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7083-159"/> attacked him, as he had been attacked in the other society;
     but he held on in his own broad, generous way. And though he never got the ear of the
     International, because he was so truly liberal, he had some little influence; and what
     influence he had ennobled their councils as they have never been ennobled since.</p>
    <p>This is not speaking against the society. I belong to it myself, and I am proud to do so. But
     I have learnt from my friend to distrust one-sided partisans, and to think all questions best
     argued from their principles, and the men who either support or oppose them left out in the
     shade. Men don't wilfully uphold the thing they know to be had. Take the stiffest Conservative
     of them all—the man who believes in the divine ordination of caste, and the absolute need
     <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7083-160"/> of preserving the fetichism of society as it is, even
     though, like Juggernaut, the great car of gentility crushes the whole working class beneath
     it—he may be, and is, sorry for the individuals; but he maintains the existing order
     conscientiously. And to blackguard him, and call him bloodsucker, and all the names that
     hysterical men do call him, is simply childish anger, not manly argument. So, on the other
     side, the men who would make a revolution by fire and blood, as has been said, if necessary,
     though they too would be sorry for the individuals who had to suffer, yet they would feel the
     thing to be done so much more righteous than the suffering would be unrighteous, that they
     would sacrifice the few and the present to the good of the many and the future. And
     <pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7083-161"/> these are no more “bloodthirsty scoundrels,” and all the
     rest of it, than their opponents. After all, it is the same battle of strength which goes on
     throughout creation—the struggle for existence in class as in individuals; and “the good old
     rule, the royal plan” has its meaning and its uses, in that it necessitates endeavour; which is
     the sole way by which things human come to perfection.</p>

    <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7083-162"/>
    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
    <p>WE were sitting one evening at the night school which Joshua still kept up, the room
     full of men and women of what the world calls the worst kind, when the door was flung open with
     a clatter, and Joe Traill, shabbier and dirtier than ever, staggered in half-drunk. I do not
     know if I have said that Joshua had at last succeeded in getting him a situation, where he
     would have done well enough had he kept off drink; but he had not; and this was the upshot
     after about three months' fair sailing.</p>
    <p>“It's no use, governor,” he said to Joshua,
     <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7083-163"/> in his drunken way; “work and no lush too hard for me,
     governor! I'd got to fall soft!”</p>
    <p>“Well Joe, my man, it seems that you have fallen soft enough this time; as soft as mud!” said
     Joshua. “However, sit down and make no noise. I will talk to you by-and-by.”</p>
    <p>“Not a copper!” said Joe, turning his pockets inside out and holding on by the tips. “I've
     come back like the devil, worse than I went!”</p>
    <p>“All right, friend, but not just now; let me go on with what I have in hand, and then I'll
     attend to you.”</p>
    <p>But Joe was in that state when a man is either maudlin or quarrelsome. He was the latter; and
     partly because he had still sense enough to be ashamed of himself, and partly
     <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7083-164"/> because he was pricking all over like a porcupine with the
     drink, and wanted to have it out with some one, he chose to try and fasten a quarrel on Joshua.
     So he set at him again; this time with some ribaldry I'll not lower myself to repeat. And again
     Joshua answered him mildly, but more authoritatively than before.</p>
    <p>“Sit down,” he said; and I don't think I ever heard his voice sound so hard and stern.
     “You've made a sore enough job of it for one day; don't add to your disgrace by folly.”</p>
    <p>Then the bad blood, the bad convict blood that never got quite clear away, boiled up in Joe,
     and he let out from his shoulder and struck Joshua on his head, at the side just above the ear.
     A dozen men rose at once; a dozen voices cursed and swore, some at
     <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7083-165"/> Joe for the blow, some yahing at Joshua for not returning
     it; women shrieked; the forms were upset as the men scrambled forward; and the quiet
     night-school was turned into a roaring Babel of tumult and violence. One brawny fellow—he too
     was a burglar, a man who might at any time develop into a murderer; but he had more fibre in
     him than poor, loose, slippery Joe, more to go upon as it were, and so could be held in hand
     better if once you could master his brutality—he squared up to the drunken creature, on whom
     already half-a-dozen hands were fiercely laid. But Joshua, who had turned white and
     sick-looking with the blow, laid his left hand on Jim's big arm, while he held out his right to
     Joe Traill, saying; “Why Joe! strike at a man, and your friend, for nothing! You must be
     <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7083-166"/> dreaming, my son, and a bad dream too! Give us your hand,
     and wake up out of it!”</p>
    <p>I can tell nothing more. There was nothing, perhaps in the words, but there was that in the
     look of him, as he stood there so white and yet so kingly, with one hand keeping back Jim
     Graves, the other offered to Joe squirming in the grasp of those who held him, that acted like
     a spell on all the room. There were men there, and women too, who would have been ready to tear
     him in pieces themselves if they had suspected for an instant that his loving leniency was from
     cowardice; but it was no coward who confronted the drunkard that had struck him, who confronted
     that roaring, yelling, crowd of desperate men and women, and calmed them all by his own
     unutterable dignity. The same intense look that had come into
     <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7083-167"/> his face when, a little lad, he had questioned the parson in
     the church, when, a youth, he had prayed for a miracle in the Rocky Valley, came into his face
     now. He was as if raised into something, more than man—so simple, so earnest as he was—so far
     above all common weaknesses, so near to God, so like to Christ!</p>
    <p>Joe burst into tears, sobered and subdued many of the women cried too, even that big
     coarse-mouthed Betsy Lyon, one of the most abandoned women of the district; while the men slunk
     together as it were, and most of them said a few rough words of praise, which, well meant as
     they were, sounded very far amiss at such a time. And then the police, attracted by the tumult,
     came up into the room; and, glad of an opportunity they had been looking for—after having been
     <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7083-168"/> knocked about a good deal, for all that Joshua and I did our
     best to protect them—marched us both off to the station-house where we were locked up for the
     night, no bail being at hand.</p>
    <p>The magistrate understood nothing of Joshua's defence next day, when he made it, but put him
     down with a severe rebuke. And as we had to be punished, reason or none, we were both sent to
     prison for a couple of weeks as a caution to us to behave ourselves better in the future. To
     live according to Christ in modern Christendom was, as we found out, to be next thing to
     criminal, and at all events qualified for prison discipline. We don't understand anything about
     the Lazaruses and Simeons and Magdalenes of our own city. When we read of our Lord and Master
     going about among the bad
     <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7083-169"/> people of His day, we say it was divine; when Joshua
     followed suit, he was locked up. Well, Christ was the criminal of His day; and Caiaphas the
     high priest, representing respectability and adhesion to the existing order of things, took Him
     in hand, and taught the multitude so well to feel how far He had erred against the morality of
     the day, that they asked for Barabbas rather than for him. And we have our Caiaphases in full
     vigour still.</p>
    <p>We had not done with poor Joe. Mr. C.'s words came too true. The demon of drink had got
     possession of him, and he was no more his own master than if he had been a lunatic in Bedlam.
     During our fortnight's imprisonment he took everything he could lay his hands on—clothes,
     furniture, tools—every individual thing, he did!—and pawned
     <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7083-170"/> them for drink; and when we were set at liberty, we found
     our place stripped.</p>
    <p>I never had Joshua's patience, and I confess I was indignant. It did seem to me such wicked
     ingratitude, such lowness!</p>
    <p>But when I flared up with sudden passion, and broke out against the thief for a rascal and a
     scoundrel, Joshua silenced me with a rebuke it was not in me to resist.</p>
    <p>“Unto seventy times seven, John?“ he said, “I think we joined hands on that line?” Then he
     added: “We must look that poor fellow up. He has got on to the incline, and, if not stopped, he
     will go down to perdition.”</p>
    <p>He took his hat and went out; and after many hours' search through all the worst haunts he
     knew of, brought Joe Traill back: and kept him.</p>
    <p>I need not go over the whole after-history
     <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7083-171"/> of this wretched castaway. It is enough to say that again
     and again he fell into bad courses, and again and again Joshua forgave him. No trial was too
     severe for his Christian forbearance, his angelic patience. “Not to the sinless, but to the
     sinners,” he used to say; and truly the sinners found it so!</p>
    <p>This unwearied sweetness, this tenderness and hope that never failed, wrought their good work
     before too late; and the convicted thief, who but for Joshua would have ended his days at the
     hulks, if not at the gallows, died,—of the results of former poverty and vice, granted—so far
     at peace with the law as to die out of jail, and repeating softly, “God bless me and forgive
     me!”</p>
    <p>These backslidings and failures were among the greatest difficulties of Joshua's work. Men
     and women, whom he had thought he had
     <pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7083-172"/> cleansed and set on a wholesome way of living, turned back
     again to the drink and the devilry of their lives. Excitement had become all in all to them;
     the monotony of virtue tired them, and they broke out into evil as a relief. But, fail as often
     and as badly as they might, they never chilled Joshua's heart, if they saddened him as indeed
     they did. He forgave them everything; whether their sins had been against himself or against
     the law; and took them up where they had left him. Sometimes they laughed at him for his
     patience with them; sometimes they swore at him and refused his friendship; sometimes they
     cried and clung about him with pathetic but short-lived gratitude; and sometimes, but not
     often, they took his better lessons to heart and reformed altogether. For the most part,
     <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7083-173"/> they just fluctuated—now bad, now good, as the fit took them
     and temptation was stronger than resolution. But, bad or good, he was ever the same to them—in
     the first case trying to win over, in the second helping to keep straight, and thankful if he
     succeeded ever so little in his endeavours.</p>
    <p>The different reasons given by the various sectarians who came along, when any of his
     failures were afloat, were what I have said before. The Evangelicals said it was because he did
     not teach the Gospel; the Church people, because he was consecrated to the task; the
     Unititarians asked him, in calm disdain, how he could expect to do good, if he made no
     difference between vice and virtue but treated both alike? while the Charity Organization
     people talked of prosecuting him for his encouragement of mendicity
     <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7083-174"/> dicity, and spoke of him as the pest of the district and the
     cause of half the pauperism about, because he helped the poor in their need without enquiring
     into the merits of the case. And they all agreed that the weak spot in his system, and the
     cause of his failures, was just this—he was not a Christian.</p>
    <p>In the midst of all Mary Prinsep came back on our hands. You may perhaps remember that her
     mistress had made a point of concealing her former life from every one; in which she was
     justified, and for Mary's sake as much as for her own. Things had gone very well so far, and
     Mary had satisfaction and worked hard to deserve it, when unfortunately that man who had known
     her only too well in the sorrowful days of her sin, came with his family to the house, on a
     visit of a day or two. All the
     <pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7083-175"/> servants were marshalled into prayers morning and evening;
     and naturally Mary with them; face to face with the guests. So there it was—on the one side a
     dignified, handsome, well-to-do gentleman, with respectable white hair and a gold eye-glass, a
     wife and a fine young family, a character to lose, and a reputation for piety; on the other, a
     poor ignorant girl, abandoned by society, driven by want into bad ways, but now doing her best
     to get out of them.</p>
    <p>It was an awkward meeting for him, and he was afraid maybe of Mary's establishing a claim, or
     telling what she knew. There he was, a guest in her master's house, with his wife and eldest
     daughter, and under his own name which she had never known, and his private and official
     addresses both to be got at. It was an instinct of self-preservation
     <pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7083-176"/> tion, no doubt; but it was cowardly all the same; and, as
     usual, the weak one had to go to the wall. He made up an excellent story to explain how it was
     that he knew the girl's former life. It was a story to his credit as a Christian gentleman
     somehow, and he told it out of sheer regard for his good friends who had been so shamefully
     imposed on. And even when the lady confessed, as she did, that she had known the main fact of
     Mary's history, she was urged so strongly to get rid of her that she consented, partly in a
     vague kind of belief that she had been imposed on and that Mary was worse than she appeared and
     capable of all manners of unknown crimes, partly by the force of respectability and the need of
     keeping up blameless appearances. So, as the right thing to do considering her position and
     <pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7083-177"/> what she owed her family and her own character, this
     lady—good Christian as she was, going to church regularly twice on Sunday, and taking the
     sacrament once a month—turned the poor creature out of doors again and she, keeping the
     gentleman's secret loyally, came back to us, as the only friends she had.</p>
    <p>She was something different to us from any other girl that Joshua had been the means of
     rescuing, and we both felt that she had a stronger claim somehow, on our exertions and
     affections. Other women came and went, and Joshua helped them and got them work, and did what
     he could for them, and always kept up a kindly interest in them, and the like of that; but they
     were unto us what Mary was; for she was like our own sister. So, when she came back, it was
     just a family sorrow somehow;
     <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7083-178"/> but, to me at least, it was a bit of a joy too. But you see
     since we had got into that trouble about Joe, and had been locked up, we had been worse off
     than ever. Masters would not employ us; mates would not work with us—we were “jail birds” to
     them; and the Union turned us out. Joshua held on though, and we got day-jobs; but we were
     often hungry and often weary; yet Joshua never let me sink into despair, nor was he ever near
     it himself, and we managed to scrape along somehow. Still, our present poverty made poor Mary's
     return embarrassing, though she didn't see it all.</p>
    <p>“It is of no use, Joshua,” she said, sitting on a chair and leaning her head on her hand
     disconsolately: “once lost, you are done for in this world! There is nothing for me but the old
     way; it is all I have left!”</p>
    <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7083-179"/>
    <p>I remember so well when she said this. The sun had come round to our window; for it was a
     summer's evening; and it came into the room, and fell on her, as she sat with her bonnet off,
     and her fair hair partly fallen about her face. She had very fine hair, and she knew it. I
     remember too that her dress was some kind of blue, and that she looked like a picture there is
     in the National Gallery; and I thought, if only some one who could save her really, and lift
     her up for ever out of the past, could but see her now!</p>
    <p>“Courage, Mary, and patience,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I know all that; but the ways and means?” said Mary, raising her eyes to him. “What can
     I do, Joshua? To get my bread any way but the old way I must creep into a house under false
     pretences, and then be
     <pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7083-180"/> always afraid of being found out; and if I am found out I am
     sure to be turned off. No one will have me who knows about me, if I work ever so hard, or try
     to do my duty ever so faithfully.”</p>
    <p>“One failure is not final,” said Joshua. “While we have a home, you have one too; you are our
     sister, remember. Only have faith, and as I said before courage and patience; and beware of the
     first step back!”</p>
    <p>“Ah, Joshua!” said Mary, “you are an angel!”</p>
    <p>“No,” he answered smiling, “I am only a man trying to live by principle.”</p>
    <p>But if he was not an angel he was not far off being one.</p>
    <p>It was difficult to know what to do for the best for Mary. We kept her for as long as we
     could, she doing our chores for
     <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7083-181"/> us in the old way for her meat and room; and then Joshua
     raised funds—I can scarce understand how, but the poorest of the people helped, as well as the
     best off—and somehow, enough was got together to establish her in a small sweet-stuff shop in
     East-street close to Church-court. To help her with the rent we went to lodge with her; which
     suited both her and ourselves; for you see we had got accustomed to her, and she to us, and she
     knew our ways, and was always good and helpful. People talked, of course; but then people talk
     about anything, reason or none, that is out of the common by ever so small a line; and no man
     who has taken an independent path can escape the comment of the crowd accustomed to only one
     way. The old report that we were living with a woman of bad
     <pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7083-182"/> character crept about again, and got down to our dear
     Cornish homes. You may be sure it made our mothers bad enough when they heard it; but I don't
     think they quite believed it, though they thought it right to send us a warning, as if they
     did; and if they did, then they believed what was not true. As for ourselves, we had our own
     consciences and Mary's salvation to keep us up; and with these it mattered little what any one
     else chose to say. As Joshua said, we had not set out in our endeavour to realise Christ for
     the sake of gain, but for the sake of the right; and if we had to suffer, we must; but the
     right was not to be abandoned because of it.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
    <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7083-183"/>
    <p>LORD X., (I may not in common honour give his name; a man however—so far I may
     say—notorious for his philanthropy of an unsteady and spasmodic kind, and for a certain
     restless curiosity to see into the inside of different social circles)—this lord, in his
     wanderings among the East-end poor, had come across Joshua in his little kingdom of endeavour
     in Church-court. And as no one could come in contact with him, without feeling that
     inexplicable charm which is inseparable from great earnestness and self-devotion, it is to be
     supposed that Lord X.
     <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7083-184"/> among the rest was attracted to the man as he was. Or maybe
     it was only a poor kind of curiosity, not sympathy; as I have since believed. However that may
     be, he and Joshua met; and a friendship was struck up between them on the spot. I use the word
     advisedly; for though the one was a peer of the realm, and the other only an artisan—not
     learned in the scholarly way of a gentleman; not refined in the same way perhaps as a
     gentleman, so far as manner and little observances went; a man speaking with a provincial
     accent, and dressed in fustian and coarse clothes—yet he was fit to take his place with the
     finest gentleman in the land; and even the finest lady would have found but little in him to
     ridicule and much to respect. And I will do both Lord and Lady X. the credit of sincerity in
     <pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7083-185"/> the beginning, when, as I said, the friendship between him
     and them was struck up.</p>
    <p>Then it must be remembered, that Joshua was one of the handsomest men you could see in a long
     summer's day; a real man; no sickly, effeminate, half-woman, but a tall, broad-shouldered,
     deep-chested fellow, largely framed, and with that calm self-control, that steady unfeverish
     energy, which seemed as if it could carry the world before it. And maybe his good looks
     influenced his new acquaintances in the beginning, even more than they themselves knew. However
     that might be, they made up to him, and seemed as though they would have been his best friends
     all through.</p>
    <p>“You want a background, Mr. Davidson,” said Lord X., one day when he called on him at our
     lodgings. “All human nature
     <pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7083-186"/> resolves itself into a mathematical formula; <hi>a</hi> plus
      <hi>y</hi> represents a quantity unattainable by <hi>a</hi> alone.”</p>
    <p>“But what background can I get, my lord?” returned Joshua. “It sounds a strange confession to
     make, but no one will work with me. Sects keep only to themselves or their affiliations; and I,
     who belong to no sect, am looked on as an enemy by all because I am an enemy to none.”</p>
    <p>“Putting sectarianism aside for the moment, you can do nothing without the sanction of
     society,” said Lord X. “No movement can succeed which is not backed by men of birth and
     money.”</p>
    <p>Joshua smiled. “This remark does not apply to the roots, my lord, I suppose?” he said; “only
     to the growth and development?”</p>
    <pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7083-187"/>
    <p>“Oh!” said Lord X., carelessly, “a low fellow might strike out an idea, but it would want a
     man of position to develop it.”</p>
    <p>“Well, perhaps you are right,” Joshua answered. “For, after all, Christianity owes more to
     Paul than to Jesus; and the Pauline development has struck deeper and spread wider than the
     Christ original.”</p>
    <p>“Just so,” said Lord X.</p>
    <p>“The one being example, both difficult to follow and subversive of the existing state of
     things; the other dogma which ranks the intellectual acceptance of a creed above the
     revolutionary ethics on which it is based,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“But, Mr. Davidson!” remonstrated Lord X., “surely even you, enthusiast as you are, must
     acknowledge that it would be impossible to go back to the practices of
     <pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7083-188"/> early Christian times? The staff and the scrip were all very
     well in their day, but they would scarcely do now. Society has become more complex and
     intricate since then; it would be out of all question to have the common purse and live in the
     barbaric simplicity of apostolic times. Times change, and manners with them.”</p>
    <p>“When is just my difficulty, my lord,” said Joshua. “For if modern society is right, then
     Christ was wrong; and we have to look elsewhere than to Him for a solution of our moral and
     social problems.”</p>
    <p>“I would not pronounce so crudely as that,” said Lord X. “Say rather that a further
     development may reconcile our differences.”</p>
    <p>“So be it, sir; yet if this is so, we are still in the same position as before, and the
     <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7083-189"/> life of Christ, as related in the Bible, is not the absolute
     example for us to follow.”</p>
    <p>“About that you must form your own opinion,” said Lord X., with a certain cynical
     indifference not pleasant to witness. What you may or may not believe of the Bible is a
     question for yourself alone to decide: it can have no interest for any one else. What has an
     interest, however, is your mode of dealing with the great social problems in which you have
     bestirred yourself; and, going back to our starting-point, I say again that you can do nothing
     if society does not assist you.”</p>
    <p>Joshua smiled a little sadly. “And I have only the same answer to make, my lord,” be said.
     “No one will help me; and my work, such as it is, stands alone.”</p>
    <p>“Then I think, Mr. Davidson, that it
     <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7083-190"/> must be your own fault,” said Lord X. “There are liberal
     denominations to which your spirit of inquiry would not be alien; why cannot you coalesce with
     them? The Broad Church do not nail their colours to your old enemy, dogma; and the Unitarians
     are not superstitious.”</p>
    <p>“But the Unitarians above all demand respectability of life,” said Joshua. “Having abandoned
     that wide harbour, the Atonement, they are obliged to anchor themselves on morality. My poor
     lost sheep would come off but badly before the rigid tribunal of Unitarian morality; and the
     Broad Church, though more humane perhaps, requires at the least repentance. But the men and
     women I have to do with are without a sense of sin—people who fail again and again, and whom
     nothing but the utmost
     <pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7083-191"/> patience can ever reclaim, if even that does.”</p>
    <p>“Then I do not see much use in your attempts,” said Lord X. “I myself would do all I could to
     rescue the poor wretches one sees in the courts and alleys from the filth and misery in which
     they live. But when I find I am doing no real good, and that they go wrong again, I leave them
     to their fate and mark them off as hopeless. You must draw a line, Mr. Davidson! For the sake
     of society, you must show some difference in our estimate of men. To treat the deserving and
     the undeserving alike is gross injustice. Some of these wretches are more like brutes than men.
     I would clear them all but like rats; and with no more compunction than if they were rats.”</p>
    <p>“I do not agree with you, my lord. I
     <pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7083-192"/> believe that more harm has been done by condemnation than
     ever would come through tolerance. By love alone can the world be saved.”</p>
    <p>“Love? Rubbish!” said Lord X. “The laws must be obeyed, and society supported.”</p>
    <p>“Only in so far as it is just,” put in Joshua.</p>
    <p>“If by just you mean equality, pardon me if I say that you talk nonsense,” said Lord X. “You
     might as well say, that nature is unjust, because a grove of oaks needs more space than a row
     of turnips, as that man is to blame because he has lifted himself into classes of which the
     superiors have more than the inferiors. If it had not been for this injustice, as you call it,
     we should never have had a superior class at all, and the world would have gone on
     <pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7083-193"/> for ever in one dead level of mediocrity, where no one
     shone, and no one was obscured.”</p>
    <p>“Granted,” said Joshua. “But you having developed into stars and suns, what we want is, that
     you should help the poor dark spheres on the same way.”</p>
    <p>Lord X. laughed. “I doubt the power and I question the wisdom of that,” he said. “Help them
     to be cleanly and virtuous and content with their natural position, if you like; but I for one
     do not go further.”</p>
    <p>“And Christ and history do, my lord,” said Joshua.</p>
    <p>“Mr. Davidson, you are incorrigible!” said Lord X., jocularly; “but happily your opinions do
     not vitiate your good works, and I will help you in these where I can.”</p>
    <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7083-194"/>
    <p>“Thank you, my lord,” said Joshua simply: “I shall hold you to your promise. And yet you must
     understand that I hope far more from the union and organization of the working classes
     together, than from any extraneous aid whatever; only we take all kinds.”</p>
    <p>“In which you are wise,” said Lord X., drily. “You would get on but poorly among yourselves I
     fancy, if it were not for Us.”</p>
    <p>Joshua did not answer. He said afterwards that, having made his declaration honestly, he felt
     it would have been ungenerous to have carried the conversation further on that line. While
     accepting my lord's help it was scarcely the thing to depreciate it; so the talk then drifted
     or rather settled on all that he had been doing in Church-court and the neighbourhood—on his
     <pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7083-195"/> night-school, his charities, his hospitality to thieves and
     the like; and the results; those whom he might fairly count as his successes, with those who
     had been as yet his failures. He never allowed more than this “as yet.” “While there is a gate
     open to them, there is always the hope that they will enter in by it,” he used to say. “What
     men are taught of Christ in heaven—that no shame, no disgrace, no sin can make Him turn away
     His face from those who seek Him—so ought they to find here on earth in human pity and human
     love. If we were more patient, we should have more power over each other, and there would be
     fewer failures.”</p>
    <p>“You mean, if we were gods we should act in a godlike manner,” said Lord X., with that
     curious mixture of cynicism and philanthropy,
     <pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7083-196"/> kindness and satire, earnestness and levity, that
     characterised him.</p>
    <p>“No,” Joshua answered; “I mean only that, if we did our best possible as men, we should make
     a better job of life altogether both for ourselves individually and for the world at
     large.”</p>
    <p>“You must come and see me, Mr. Davidson,” said Lord X., suddenly rising and drawing on his
     gloves. “Lady X. will be charmed to see you, I am sure. She is immensely interested in all
     sorts of social questions, and I shall be delighted to present you. You will be a new reading
     to her,” he added, and smiled.</p>
    <p>“I will come and be read,” said Joshua “and I hope to a good end. If I can interest you, and
     your friends through you, my lord, I shall have done something.”</p>
    <pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7083-197"/>
    <p>This was the first time that I had seen Joshua really elated with hope of help from the
     outside. He knew that Lord X. was a man of immense wealth, and that he could, if he would, do
     wonders for his poor friends. But he did not know how shallow his philanthropic zeal was; how
     much more a matter of mere amusement than of vital principle. His work among the poor was the
     work of a superior; and his estimate of his own class, and therefore of himself as a peer, was
     so curiously great, that he thought his very presence among them ought to prove a kind of balm
     and moral styptic to all their wounds. He was willing to give when the fit took him; but he
     would have resented the doctrine of duty, or the right to take. The poor were as curious
     specimens to him. He never regarded them as men
     <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7083-198"/> and women like himself and his class. He scarcely gave them
     credit for ordinary human feeling even; for he used to say that affections and nerves were both
     matters of education and refinement, and that the uneducated and unrefined neither loved nor
     felt as the others. Perhaps he was right. I am not physiologist enough to know much about
     nerves and pain and the difference of education, so far as that goes; but I think I have seen
     as much real affection, as much passionate self-abandoning, self-sacrificing love among the
     poor as there is among the rich. It may be more uncouth, its demonstration more simple too, and
     less elegantly expressed, but it is there all the same, and maybe in fuller quantity than with
     fashionable folks who really seem too idle and dispersed to be able to love with either vigour
     or concentration.</p>
    <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7083-199"/>
    <p>Furthermore, philanthropy to Lord X. was an occupation and a reputation. He had no turn for
     abstract polities, no head for diplomacy, no taste for literature; he was not all artist nor a
     mechanician, but he was ambitious, and he liked distinction. So, dabbling among the poor, and
     touching the grave social problems besetting them delicately, following them to their haunts
     and relieving their immediate distress, pleased both his kind heart and his vanity; and he did
     substantial good of a fragmentary kind, if his motives would scarce bear severe scrutiny.</p>
    <p>For myself I did not augur much from the association. Less spiritual and less single-minded
     than my friend, I could also judge better than he of his own power of fascination. Hence I
     could discern more
     <pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7083-200"/> clearly than he, how much of Lord X.'s offer of help was the
     genuine movement of his own soul, and how much was due to the curiosity and amusement which the
     study of a life and character at once so fresh and whole-hearted as his awakened and promised.
     But it was not for me to speak, or throw cold water on what might turn out to be such a boon to
     the cause. If Joshua had wanted my advice, he would have asked it. As he did not ask it, I
     considered him best able to judge for himself. And yet sometimes I have been sorry that I did
     not speak.</p>

    <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
    <p>THIS was Joshua's first introduction into a wealthy house of the upper classes; and
     from the retinue of servants in their gorgeous liveries thronging the hall, to the little
     lapdog on its velvet cushion, the luxury and lavishness he saw everywhere almost stupified him.
     To a man earning, say some twenty-five shillings a week, and living on less than half—sharing
     with those poorer than himself, and content to go short that others might be satisfied—the
     revelation of Lord X.'s house was a sharp and positive pain. The starvation he, the nobleman,
     had seen in his
     <pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7083-202"/> wanderings—starvation in all probability relieved for
     to-day; but to-morrow and the day after and for all future time, till the pauper's grave closed
     over all?—and then had come back to an abundance, a fastidiousness, of which the very refuse
     would have been salvation to hundreds; the miserable dwellings he visited, mere styes of filth,
     immodesty, and vice, where the seeds of physical disease and moral corruption are sown
     broadcast and from earliest infancy—and then returned to a dwelling like a fairy palace, where
     every nook and corner was perfect, redolent of all kinds of sweetness and loveliness—to a man
     of the people like Joshua, fairly oppressive in its richness and grandeur; the gaunt and
     famine-wasted men and women and children that he had so often met, the little ones brutally treated,
     <pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7083-203"/> half starved, sworn at, and knocked about, swarming through
     reeking courts and alleys where the very air of heaven was poisonous—and the lady's lap-dog,
     with its dainty food, its tender care, well washed, combed, curled, scented, adorned, on a
     velvet footstool, a toy bought for it to play with: and that man and that woman—this lord and
     lady—-were professing Christians, went regularly to church, believed that Christ was very God,
     and that every word of the Bible was inspired! It was habit; but at first sight it looked
     incomprehensible to one who lived among the poor, and was of them.</p>
    <p>Lady X. soon came into the room where Joshua and Lord X. were. She was a tall, fair, languid
     woman, kindly natured but selfish, dissatisfied with her life as it was yet unable to devise
     anything better for herself;
     <pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7083-204"/> having no interest anywhere, without children, and evidently
     not as much in love with her husband as model wives usually are: a woman whose intelligence and
     physique clashed, the one being restless and the other indolent. Every now and then she took up
     her husband's “cases,” partly out of complaisance to him, partly, from profound weariness with
     her life, and also from the natural kind-heartedness which made her like to do good-natured
     things and to give pleasure to others. But she soon abandoned then and set them adrift. She was
     a woman with great curiosity but no tenacity; full of a soft sensual kind of passion that led
     her into danger as much from idleness as from vice; she loved out of idleness, and worked out
     of idleness. It was a gain to her to be interested in anything—whether it
     <pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7083-205"/> was the fashion of the day or the salvation of a human soul;
     but there was no spirit of self-sacrifice in her, and she would have considered it an
     impertinence if she had been asked to do a hair's-breadth more than she desired of her own
     free-will. Had she been born poor, she might have been a grand woman; as she was, she was just
     a fine lady whose nobler nature was stifled under the weight of idleness and luxury.</p>
    <p>But she liked Joshua, and took to him kindly.</p>
    <p>She gave him at that first interview a really handsome sum of money for his poorer friends;
     she promised clothes and soup-tickets, books for his school, toys for his children, good food
     for his sick. The simple yet so grand earnestness of the man interested her, and she too felt
     as every
     <pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7083-206"/> one else did, that here was a master-spirit which had a
     claim to all men's reverence and admiration. She was not satisfied with his first visit, but
     Joshua must go to see her again; and after he had been there twice, she of herself offered to
     come and see him in his lodgings, over the little sweet-stuff shop which Mary Prinsep kept. And
     Joshua did not forbid her.</p>
    <p>Was there ever such an incongruity? The street—East-street—in which we lived, was too narrow
     for her carriage to come down, so she had to walk the distance to Joshua's rooms. And I shall
     never forget the sight. Her dainty feet were clothed in satin on which glittered buckles that
     looked like diamonds; her dress was of apple-blossom-coloured silk that trailed behind her; her
     bonnet seemed to be just a feather and a
     <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7083-207"/> veil; she wore some light lace thing about her that looked
     like a cloud more than a fabric; and her arms and neck were covered with chains and lockets and
     bracelets. She was like a fairy queen among the gnomes and blackamoors of an underground mine,
     like a sweet-scented rose-bush in the midst of a refuse heap as she came picking her way with
     courage, but with exaggerated delicacy, her footman in his blue and silver at her back, and the
     mob of the street staring, too much astonished at such an apparition to jeer.</p>
    <p>When she came into the little shop and asked for Joshua, I was standing in the doorway (it
     was on a Sunday) between the shop and back room; and for the first time I saw Mary in an ugly
     light. She turned quite white as the lady came in, and
     <pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7083-208"/> instead of answering, looked round to me with an agony in
     her face that was indescribable.</p>
    <p>“Yes, madam,” I said coming forward; “he is up-stairs.”</p>
    <p>“Do you want him, ma'am?” then asked Mary, the look of pain still in her large fixed eyes;
     and I thought that the lady, looking at her—for Mary was young and very pretty, as I have
     said—looked uneasy too. At all events, she looked haughty.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” she said; but she turned and spoke to me, not to Mary. “Have the goodness to tell him
     that Lady X. wants to speak to him.”</p>
    <p>I ran upstairs and told him; and Joshua, without changing his countenance one whit, as if
     lords and ladies in gorgeous array were our natural visitors and what we were used
     <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7083-209"/> to every day, came down and greeted the lady as he would
     have greeted the baker's wife—neither more nor less respectfully; which means, that he was
     respectful to every one.</p>
    <p>Lady X. made a step forward when he came into the shop, and the blood flew over her face as
     she gave him her hand.</p>
    <p>“Now, you must let me see where you live, and how you do such wonders,” she said, with the
     most undefinable but unmistakable accent of coaxing in the voice.</p>
    <p>And Joshua saying quietly; “Are you not too fine to come up our stairs, Lady X.?—we do our
     best to keep them clean, Mary, don't we? but they are not used to such-like feet on them;” gave
     her his hand smiling.</p>
    <p>“They will be used to mine, I hope, often,”
     <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7083-210"/> said my lady kindly. “You know I have taken a great interest
     in your work, Mr. Davidson, and I am going to help when I can.”</p>
    <p>“If you will come this way then, my lady, I will show you all I have on hand at the present
     moment,” said Joshua moving towards the stairs.</p>
    <p>And again the lady blushed; and her long silk skirts trailed behind her with a curious
     rustling noise; and we heard her light bootheels go tap, tap, up the stairs, and her chains and
     trinkets jingle.</p>
    <p>Then Mary turned to me, and said with a wild kind of look; “John! John! she is here for no
     good! She will harm more than she helps. What call has she to come here? who wants her? She
     will only do us all a mischief!”</p>
    <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7083-211"/>
    <p>She turned her face to the window and burst into tears.</p>
    <p>“Mary! what ails you?” I said, vaguely; for I was shocked, and did not rightly understand
     her. I seemed to feel something I could not give a name to—a pain and a queer kind of doubt;
     but indeed it was all chaotic, and all I knew was that I was sorry. “You know,” I went on
     trying to comfort her, “that money and worldly influence at Joshua's back would give him all he
     wants. His hands are so weak now for want of both these things. Why should we be sorry, dear,
     that he has the chance of them?”</p>
    <p>“She has come for no good!” was all that Mary would say; and I could only wonder at an
     outburst unlike anything I had ever seen before.</p>
    <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7083-212"/>
    <p>My lady stayed a long time upstairs, and poor Mary's agony during her visit never relaxed. At
     last she came down, flushed and radiant. Her eyes were softer and darker, her face looked
     younger and more tender; she even glanced kindly at me as she passed me, saying to Joshua in a
     voice as sweet as a silver bell; “And this the John you have been telling me about? He looks a
     good fellow!—and is this Mary?” but she was not quite so tender to Mary; and she added, in
     rather a displeased tone of voice; “Girl! you look very young to keep house by yourself, and
     have young, men lodgers!”</p>
    <p>“Ah, my lady, you forget that our girls have not the care taken of them that yours have,”
     said Joshua gently. “So soon as a girl of ours can get her living, she does.”</p>
    <pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7083-213"/>
    <p>“Well, I hope that Mary will be a good girl, and do you credit,” said my lady coldly.</p>
    <p>She shook hands then with Joshua, but, with her hand still in his, turned to him and, with
     the sweetest smile I have ever seen on woman's face, said in the same strange caressing way; “I
     must ask you to be kind enough to take me to my carriage, Mr. Davidson. I think my footman must
     have gone to keep the coachman company; and I should scarcely like to go down the street
     alone.”</p>
    <p>“Certainly not,” said Joshua, and led her, still holding her hand, out from the shop and into
     the little street to where her carriage was waiting for her.</p>
    <p>“Mind the shop for me, John,” said Mary; and with a great sob she ran
     <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7083-214"/> away and shut herself up in her own room,</p>
    <p>She would have been ashamed I know, to let Joshua see that she was crying, and all for
     nothing, too; only because a fine lady, smelling of sweet scents and wearing a rich silk gown,
     had passed through the shop.</p>
    <p>As for him, he came back without a ruffle on his quiet, mild face. There was no flush of
     gratified vanity on it; nothing but just that inward, absorbed look, that look of peace and
     love which beautified him at all times. As he passed through, he looked round for Mary; but I
     told him she was bad with her head; and as this had the effect of sending him into her room to
     look after her, poor Mary's attempt at concealment came to nothing. But I don't think Joshua
     found out why she was crying.</p>
    <pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7083-215"/>
    <p>Many a day after this my lady's carriage came to the entrance of our wretched street, and my
     lady herself, like a radiant vision, picked her way among garbage and ruffianism down to the
     little sweet-stuff shop where ha'pennyworths of “bulls'-eyes” were sold to young children by a
     girl who had once been a street-walker, and where the upstairs rooms were tenanted by two
     journeymen carpenters. It was an anomaly that could not last; but the very sharpness of the
     contrast gave it interest in her eyes; and while the novelty continued it was like a scene out
     of a play in which she was the heroine. So, at least, I judged her; and the more I think of the
     whole affair, the more sure I feel that I am right.</p>
    <p>And then Joshua's handsome face and
     <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7083-216"/> dignity of look and manner might count for something.</p>
    <p>She (the lady) was truly good and helpful to Joshua all the time this fad of hers lasted; for
     that it was only a fad, without stability or roots, the sequel proved. She brought him clothes
     and money, and seemed ready to do all she could for him. He had only to tell her that he wanted
     such and such help, and she gave it, aye, like a princess!</p>
    <p>What took place between them neither I nor any one can say. Joshua never opened his lips on
     the subject; and after that day, by tacit consent all round, the name of Lord and Lady X. was a
     dead letter among us. All I know is, that one day, when she had come down to our place as so
     often now, my lady, flushed, haughty, trembling too, but changed
     <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7083-217"/> somehow, with a sad, disordered face instead of the
     half-sleepy sweetness usual to it, came downstairs—not this time holding Joshua's hand; he
     following her, pale and troubled-looking; that she passed through the little shop quickly and
     impatiently, with never a glance towards Mary or me; that at the door she turned round, and
     said sharp “You need not give yourself the trouble, Mr. Davidson, to come with me—I can find my
     way alone;” and this Joshua answered with more tenderness and humility of tone and manner than
     I have ever seen or heard in him before; “My lady, I must disobey you: I cannot let you go
     through the street alone.” And that he followed her out, bareheaded, but at a little distance
     from her—not beside her.</p>
    <p>This was the last time we saw her; nor
     <pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7083-218"/> did Lord X. keep up any association with my friend. And I
     heard afterwards, quite accidentally, that he, had said soon after this, he really “could not
     countenance that man Davidson: he was too offensively radical in his opinions, and a presuming,
     fellow besides.”</p>
    <p>But word came to us both that my lady had found out all about Mary, and that she had
     expressed herself insulted and revolted at Joshua's allowing her to enter a house kept by such
     a creature.</p>
    <p>“It was all very well to be compassionate and helpful,” she had said; “but no amount of
     charity justified that man Davidson in his proceedings with such a woman. Or, if he chose to
     associate with her himself, he ought to have warned her (her ladyship), that <emph>she</emph>
     should not have made the mistake
     <pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7083-219"/> take of speaking to her as to a proper person.”</p>
    <p>So this first and last attempt at aristocratic co-operation fell to the ground; and Society
     peremptorily refused to endorse a man who had set himself to live the life after Christ.</p>
    <p>If Joshua was sorry for the loss he had so mysteriously sustained, poor Mary was not. All
     during the lady's visits she had drooped and pined, till I thought she was in a bad way, and
     going to be worse. Ah! this was a bitter time to me, for I loved her like my own; and I loved
     Joshua and his work and his life better than my own life; and I was perplexed, and in a manner
     torn to pieces, among so many feelings. But she revived after the day when the lady passed
     through the shop with her sad, proud, disordered
     <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7083-220"/> face, and when Joshua came back from seeing her to her
     carriage, like a man who has had a blow and is still dazed by it. She waited on him after this,
     more assiduously than ever. She seemed to live only to please him. The plate was the very
     perfection of cleanliness. Even my lady's palace could not have been more wholesome or more
     pure. The squalor of the shell, so to speak, and the poverty of the inside, was concealed or
     made to be forgotten by the exquisite neatness and cleanliness with which it was all kept; and
     when Joshua's countenance came back again, as it did after awhile, to its usual sweet serenity,
     Mary's also came to its peace, and the cloud that had hung over it like a distemper passed
     away.</p>
    <p>“It will not do, John!” he said to me one
     <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7083-221"/> day, some time after: “for the aristocracy to come down to
     the poor is a mistake. They are different creatures altogether, with different laws of honour
     and morality among themselves from what we know anything about. And the gulf is too wide to be
     bridged over by just one here, and another there, coming like the old Israelitish spies among
     us, to see the nakedness of the land. They do a little good for the time, but it is good that
     bears no blessing with it, and is not lasting. We must work up by ourselves into a state nearer
     to them in material good; but not,” he added, as if by an after-thought, “in looseness of
     principle. That, however, has come only from idleness; and if great people had imperative
     duties and the absolute need of exertion, we should hear of fewer divorce scandals, fewer turf catastrophes
     <pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7083-222"/> trophes, and the like, than we do now. However, that is not
     our affair. We are here to work on our own account, not to judge of others.”</p>
    <p>“It is an old saying, Joshua, but a true one, ‘extremes meet,’” said I. “The very poor have
     no taste for refined pleasure, and indeed no power of indulging it if they had; and the very
     rich, sated with all that is given to them by their position, devise new excitements of an
     ignoble kind. I suppose that is something like it?”</p>
    <p>“I suppose so,” he answered. “At all events, there can be no such thing as levelling down. It
     would be no righteousness to bring the rich, the refined, the well educated down to the level
     of the poor; but to raise up the masses, and to impose on the upper classes positive duties,
     this is the only way
     <pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7083-223"/> in which the difference between high and low can be
     lessened. And if this can be can free of national revolt and bloodshed, it will be a godlike
     work, and the blessed solution of the greatest difficulty the world has seen yet. It cannot be
     a good thing that some men have to work till all the strength of intellect is worked out of
     them, while others are lapped in such idleness that all theirs is either bemused and stagnated,
     or turned to evil issues for want of being wholesomely used. Come how it may, it has to
     come—this more equal distribution of the better things of life. I do not mean that the duchess
     will have to share her velvet cushions with the seamstress; but it has to be that, either by
     education or improved machinery, or both, there will not be the enormous difference there is
     now between the
     <pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7083-224"/> duchess and the seamstress. We have made a great parade
     lately of our sympathy with the North, on the ground of emancipation; but Society here in
     London holds slaves as arbitrarily and as cruelly is ever the Southern planters did ; and its
     vested interests, however demoralising, are as sacred to us as were the vested interests of the
     planter to him. I will never again try a fraternal union with a rich house. When the workingmen
     have their political and social rights, and have utilised their leisure to refine and elevate,
     to beautify and adorn their lives, then, when we are radically equal, we can meet as men and
     brothers. As we are now, we are experiments to some, mere temporary amusements to others,
     inferiors to all; and we pin our faith to a straw—hang our golden hopes on gossamer—
     <pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7083-225"/> when we look for vital co-operation from them.”</p>
    <p>“I thought Joshua would find her out in time,” was Mary's comment. “I took stock of her from
     the first, and saw she was no good.”</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
    <p>I HAVE said so much of the personal charities of Joshua that I seem to have thrown
     into the shade, by comparison, his political life and action; and yet this was the more
     important of the two. The extreme section of republican working men, though they did not go in
     for his religious views, made use of his political zeal; and when work was bad to get,
     sometimes he was sent as a delegate, sometimes he went of his own accord, to the various towns
     that needed either encouragement or awakening; where he gave lectures on the necessity of labour
     <pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7083-226"/> keeping a close front against the serried ranks of capital;
     on the lawfulness and desirability of trades' unions and strikes, when occasion demands; on the
     political worth of a republic that grows naturally out of monarchy and oligarch, as manhood
     grows out of childhood; on the need of the working classes raising themselves to a higher level
     in mind and circumstance than that which they occupy now; on the beauty of social and moral
     freedom; and on the right of each man to a fair share of the primary essentials for good
     living. And all this was mixed up with that fervid practical Christianity of his, which gave a
     new and holier aspect to every question he handled.</p>
    <p>Joshua believed in the religion of politics. He often said that, were Christ to come
     <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7083-227"/> again in this day, He would be more of a politician than a
     theologian; and that he would teach men to work for the coming of the kingdom of heaven on
     earth, rather through the general elevation of the material condition of the masses than by
     either ritual or dogma.</p>
    <p>“You can't make a man a saint in mind,” I have heard him say more than once, “when you keep
     him like a beast in body;” and “higher wages, better food, better lodgment, and better
     education will do more to make men real Christians than all the churches ever built.”</p>
    <p>No man was more convinced than he that sin and misery are the removable results of social
     circumstances, and that poverty, ignorance, and class-distinctions consequent, are at the root
     of all the crimes and wretchedness
     <pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7083-228"/> ness afloat. The evil lying in that great curse of partial
     civilisation—that upas tree of caste—by which this Christian world of ours, with its religion
     of brotherhood and socialism, is overshadowed, pained him most of all. The caste of the rich,
     with its product, the class antagonism of the poor—what a sorry satire on the religion of Jesus
     of Nazareth, that poor, unlearned man of the people, whom we have exalted into God and now
     worship with gorgeous ceremonial, while despising every one of the social doctrines He and His
     disciples preached! However, Joshua did his best to rouse men to a consciousness of Christ, and
     to the acceptance of His teaching of human equality; and though steadily closed to all
     doctrines of violence, was always the passionate upholder of the doctrine of
     <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7083-229"/> duty on the one side and the theory of rights on the
     other.</p>
    <p>He had often a sore time of it. His discourses roused immense antagonism, and he was
     sometimes set upon and severely handled by the men to whom he spoke. I have seen him left for
     dead twice in the rough monarchical towns. But he worked as the Master had worked before him;
     simply changing the methods to be more in harmony with the times; going on his way calm,
     unshaken, cheerful, ever ready to face the worst and take what danger might arise without
     blenching; of a steadfast heart and a loyal spirit; looking up to God, living after Christ, and
     loving the humanity that blackguarded and nearly killed him as his reward. Tears are in my
     eyes, rough man as I am, when I remember Joshua Davidson, his life
     <pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7083-230"/> and works, and what the world he lived but to better said of
     him and did to him. I have known swindlers and murderers more gently treated. Of a truth, the
     age of martyrs has not passed away; as any one may prove in his own person who will set himself
     to enlarge the close boroughs of thought, and to rectify the injustice of society.</p>
    <p>The war broke out between France and Prussia, and at the first the tide of liberal sympathies
     went with Prussia, as representing opposition to the Empire. But as time went on, sides
     changed, and moderates backed up Prussia, while the ultra-Tories and the Republicans went with
     France; the one hoping to see the Empire restored, the other longing for the establishment of
     liberty. And Joshua's sympathies changed with the
     <pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7083-231"/> rest. I ought perhaps to have made more than I have done of
     his intimacy with certain foreign socialists and reformers. Félix Pyat I have already spoken
     of. He was one of our warmest friends; and, to go to a very materialistic part of the subject,
     his association with us both was of great value, not only for the sake of the man himself, but
     also for the opportunity he afforded us of learning the French language.</p>
    <p>When the Commune declared itself on the eighteenth of March, none but those in the centre of
     advanced political feeling can tell what passionate hopes were awakened in the men who care for
     liberty and believe in social progress. Comtists, Internationalists, Secularists, Socialists,
     Republicans, by what name soever the doctrine of liberty and brotherhood may be proclaimed, we
     all looked over
     <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7083-232"/> to Paris with an anxiety that was as painful as if we stood
     watching the struggles of a beloved friend with our own hands bound. There were men whom that
     time sent mad with hope and fear; and some that I could name are now lying cold in their graves
     for sorrow at the failure of the righteous cause. The Commune, successful in Paris, meant the
     emancipation of the working classes here, and later on the peaceable establishment of the
     Republic; which we all believe <emph>has to come</emph>, whether peaceably established or
     not.</p>
    <p>On the nineteenth of March, Joshua resolved to go over to Paris, to help, so far as he could,
     in the cause of humanity. I never saw him so full of enthusiasm. Every now and then, especially
     of late, his hope, if not his zeal, had slackened a little before
     <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7083-233"/> the magnitude of the task he had undertaken at home. Alone
     as he was, not only unsupported by any influential men whatsoever, but actively supposed by
     many, he found his work of amelioration very hard, and the results unsatisfactory. But to help
     in the establishment of an organised liberty like the Commune—that seemed the best thing any
     man loving his fellow-men could do; and accordingly, he and I agreed to go over at once. And
     poor Mary Prinsep was broken hearted. But, sorry as he was to give her sorrow, his duty was too
     clear before him to let him hesitate; and, stifling whatever grief of private affection he
     might leave behind him, he set his face toward Paris; and after some difficulties and dangers
     we arrived there, “let into the trap” as so many before and after us.</p>
    <pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7083-234"/>
    <p>As this is not a history of the Commune it is not necessary to say much about the leaders.
     Some he loved like his very brothers; others, chiefly of the noisier sort, he distrusted as
     leaders, and would rather have seen subordinate to better-balanced minds. He might not too,
     have always agreed even with the men he loved. Being men, they were fallible; but they did
     honestly for the best, and the abuse hurled at them—a “nest of miscreants,” a “handful of
     brigands,” and the like—was as untrue as it was illogical. There were among the Communist
     leaders men as noble as ever lived upon earth; men, whatever their special creed, the most
     after the pattern of Christ in their faithful endeavour to help the poor and to raise the
     lowly, to rectify the injustice of conventional distinctions, and to give all men an equal
     <pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7083-235"/> chance of being happy, virtuous, and human.</p>
    <p>Never had Paris been so free from crime as during the administration of the Commune—never so
     pure. All the vice which had disgraced the city ever since the congenial Empire had enlisted,
     was swept clean out of it; and not the most reckless vilifiers of these latter-day Christ-men
     could make out a case of peculation, of greed, or of uncleanness among them. Skilled artisans
     abandoned their lucrative callings for the starvation-pay of a franc and a half a day, and set
     themselves—not to amass wealth, not to gain power, nor to live in luxury and pleasure—but to
     plan for the best for their fellow-men, and to sketch out a future glorious alike for France
     and the whole world. The working man vindicated then his claim to be entrusted
     <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7083-236"/> trusted with his own self-government; and one of the
     brightest pages of modern history, in spite of all its mistakes, is that wherein the artisan
     government of '71 wrote its brief but noble record on the heart of Paris.</p>
    <p>The most fatal thing of that time, however, was the unconquerable distrust of the people.
     Long used to tyranny and treachery as they had been, they seemed unable to accept any man as a
     true patriot, not plotting underhand for his own advantage. They trusted no one—not even their
     sworn and tested friends. And we can scarcely wonder at it. Twenty years of Louis Napoleon, the
     military command of Trochu, the history of the past Imperial administration and the present
     Imperial war, had eaten into their very hearts, and taken all the faith out of them. And the
     consequence was, that even the men
     <pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7083-237"/> now heading the great liberation movement, the best and most
     unselfish of the “sinless Cains” of history, were suspected by the very city they were
     sacrificing themselves to save.</p>
    <p>But Paris was mad—mad with despair, with famine, with shame, disease, excitement. The gaunt
     frames, the hollow cheeks, the wild eyes that met you at every turn, were eloquent witnesses of
     the state of men's minds; and I shall never forget the mournful impression it all made on me.
     No one looked sane, save the leaders, and perhaps a few of us more cool-headed Anglo-Saxons.
     The Poles, who had flocked in to take part in a cause they identified with their own broken
     nationality, added the fever of their political despair to the fire consuming the vitals of the
     Parisians; the Italians poured
     <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7083-238"/> in their bitter hatred to the priests as oil on
     flames—emblems to them of tyranny, treachery, ignorance, and persecution they could not be
     brought to acknowledge even the good that is in them, but were ever their unrelenting enemies;
     the republicans of all nations gathered into the struggling city, each with his own specific
     and his own desires; everywhere was fierce excitement, and the conflict of hope and fear, high
     endeavour and deep despair; while it grew clearer and clearer, as the days passed by, that the
     cause of the freedom of Paris, and with Paris of Europe—the cause of the rights and better
     organisation of labour—was lost for the hour, and that hope only was left for the future. The
     city has overmatched, and liberty was doomed. It was but a question of time; the Commune had to
     die, and
     <pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7083-239"/> it resolved to die fighting and unsurrendered.</p>
    <p>Of all the Communists, Delescluze was the one Joshua loved most, because he esteemed him
     most; and this, not forgetting his old loyalty and friendship to Félix Pyat, nor denying
     reverence and love to many others. But there was something special in Delescluze. His heroic
     spirit, his martyr's life, his unbroken courage, his unquenchable faith, and that quiet sadness
     which seemed like the sadness of a prophet—all that he was, and had been, raised one's
     admiration more than any other man among them was able to do; and Joshua was one of his chosen
     friends. We were both present at the sitting where he vowed, in answer to a taunt flung like a
     bomb-shell among the members, not to survive the insurrection. The effect was
     <pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7083-240"/> electrical; it was like a leaf out of old-world history,
     telling of a time when patriotism was a passion of which men were not ashamed. And when that
     noble old man rose so quietly, so solemnly, with no theatrical display or frothy excitement,
     but calmly registered the vow he afterwards kept with such sublime courage, it was as a torch
     that lighted every heart and soul there with Pentecostal fire. All knew what his words meant;
     and we, who shared his private thoughts and feelings as brothers, knew perhaps more than some
     others. Ah! the Society that needs such victims as Delescluze to bolster up its rottenness had
     better crumble to dust as it stands.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7083-241"/>
    <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
    <p>IT was early in the evening, and we were walking slowly along the Boulevard
     Montmartre, when I saw a wayworn woman coming with staggering steps towards us, but at some
     distance yet. Her dress was torn; her pale face was turned anxiously to each passer-by,
     scanning every one with a wild scrutiny, not curious so much as full of yearning; her fair hair
     was hanging in disordered masses about her face and neck; but when I tried to speak, pointing
     her out to Joshua, something in my throat prevented me. There was no need to speak ; she saw
     <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7083-242"/> us almost as soon as I had recognised her, and, holding out
     her hands, as we came up hurriedly, said with a plaintive kind of weary smile, “I knew that I
     should light on you, Joshua!”</p>
    <p>Then she sank in a heap at his feet, her arms stretched out, and her fair hair trailed in the
     dust.</p>
    <p>Poor loving, faithful Mary! She had travelled for the last days on foot; and if we men had
     suffered on our journey, she had suffered ten times more. It seems she had set out almost
     immediately after us, though she had been more than three weeks longer on the road. She was but
     an ignorant girl, it must be remembered; she had not come yet to the point of knowing that
     obedience was even a higher quality than love, and that love is best shown by obedience.</p>
    <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7083-243"/>
    <p>Here she was however, and we took her home to our lodgings in the Rue Blanche; and the
     concierge laughed significantly when asked for a room where she might be lodged. It would have
     been better to have refused her admission altogether, than to have laughed and leered as he
     did. The blood came into Joshua's pale face for just a moment; but there was no likelihood of
     his failing to do right for fear of its looking like wrong, so he gravely gave Mary his hand,
     and led her to our apartment. She was full of self-reproach and contrition when she saw the
     false position in which she had placed him; but he would not hear a word. “If you have been
     less than wise, my girl,” he said, “you have been true of heart; so we will balance the one
     against the other, and cry quits!”</p>
    <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7083-244"/>
    <p>This concierge was a man who, from the first, inspired me with disgust and a vague dread. He
     was a red-haired, coarse-featured, ruffianly-looking fellow, by name Legros; now in the time of
     the Commune a noisy republican; but one could fancy him under the Empire standing with his
     greasy cap in hand shouting, “Vive l'Empereur!” with the loudest. He was a man who had not, I
     should say, one single guiding principle of life save selfishness—a frank, cynical, unabashed
     selfishness—a selfishness that believed in nothing save self; and to whom amassing miserable
     little sums of money to be spent in sensuality, was the ultimate of human cleverness and
     happiness; a man without faith, honour, justice, or mercy. I do not think I am too hard in my
     judgment of him; for he was one of the men
     <pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7083-245"/> who make the theory of the devil very easy to believe.</p>
    <p>Among the sentiments professed by Legros was that of disbelief in womanly virtue. He laughed
     at the idea of purity as possible in the friendship of men and women, and of course had his own
     ideas about Mary; which it seems he expressed pretty plainly. It was some gross insult, I never
     heard precisely what, that he offered to the poor girl which brought the whole thing to a
     conclusion. We had both been out, leaving her at home; and when we came back we found her in a
     state of excitement and indignation at something that had happened during our absence. She told
     Joshua, not me; and indeed, the first I rightly heard of it was when Joshua came back from
     downstairs, where he had been into the porter's
     <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7083-246"/> lodge, and had thrashed Legros to within an inch of his
     life. This was the first and only time he had ever raised his hand against any one; and I was
     sorry he had not left the job to me. I would have done it as well, and he would have kept his
     hands clean. Yet for all this, when Legros, who had been wounded by a chance splinter, was in
     the hospital, Joshua attended to him specially, and mainly kept him alive by his care.</p>
    <p>No one worked harder in these days of dread and turmoil than Joshua. This was what he had
     come to do. Among the poor and starving, the wounded and dismayed, there he was, day after day,
     helping all who needed so far as he could, tender as a woman, faithful and strong as a hero. Or
     he did the work of the Commune, as he might be ordered; and they had no more trustworthy
     <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7083-247"/> official. Never a thought of self came in to weaken or
     distract him. For several nights at a stretch he did not go to bed, and he seemed to have the
     strength of half-a-dozen men, and to be kept up by an almost supernatural power. For the famine
     that was wasting the city was touching him with no tender hand. Day by day he got paler and
     thinner; his eyes, always bright and as if they were looking at something farther off than we
     could see, were sunk and dark and hollow; his cheeks were drawn and pale, his lips blackening
     and parched. But he never complained; he never seemed to think of himself at all; and if he had
     been without food for twelve hours or twenty-four, the chances were that he would share his
     scanty rations with the first passer-by who looked famine-stricken. Mary too was suffering
     <pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7083-248"/> from the want and privation of all kinds with which we were
     afflicted. We did what we could for her, be sure. If my life could have bought hers or his, I
     would have laid it down as willingly as I would have given them my bitter crust. But they bore
     up bravely, both of them; and she helped too with the sick and wounded. She was let to nurse in
     the English ambulances, where she was interpreted when necessary; and even at the worst her
     face as she went softly about the beds was pleasant for the sick and dying to look at. And here
     let me say how entirely in these late years all trace of her former condition had passed out of
     it. Purified by love; that was it; so that she looked now as if she might have come out of a
     convent. This is no fancy of my own. Any one who knew Joshua, and consequently
     <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7083-249"/> Mary Prinsep whom he had saved, will endorse what I say.</p>
    <p>Things were looking wild and stormy, and the day of our doom was coming near. The
     Versaillists were too strong for us, and the hope of European freedom was over for the time;
     only for the time! For so sure as day follows on the night, so surely will the law of human
     rights follow on the tyrannies and oppressions which have so long ruled the world; and the
     faith for which the Commune bled, will be triumphant. But for the present, God help this poor
     sorrowful world of ours.</p>
    <p>The Vicaire-Général had gone to Versailles, but he had not returned; and no answer had been
     vouchsafed to the offer made, now I think for the third time, to release the Archbishop and the
     other hostages for the one
     <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7083-250"/> exchange of Blanqui. How often must the story be told? And
     will it ever be acknowledged by those who care only, right or wrong, to fasten the stain of
     blood-guiltiness on the Commune, that the real murderer of Monseigneur Darboy, and the rest,
     was M. Thiers? He knew what would happen, as well as a man knows will happen if he puts a
     lighted match to a barrel of gunpowder. He knew that the hostages would be sacrificed. Inflamed
     as Paris was, surrounded by an enemy that treated her like a wild beast, and even shook hands
     with the common foe for her destruction, her best men spoken of as creatures below humanity,
     her hour of humiliation and bloody agony at hand—he knew there would be no calm reasoning out
     of consequences, no quiet acceptance of the result. Men's blood was up; and the
     <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7083-251"/> result was foreseen and played for. It was a heavy stake to
     pay; but to discredit the Commune, and attach to it the ineffaceable stain of blood-guiltiness,
     was worth even an Archbishop and some sixty other lives!</p>
    <p>We were at the prison during the time of the execution. It would be impossible to describe
     distinctly how it all took place. No one has, and no one ever will. The whole thing as
     confusion. No person knew exactly what was being done, or by whom; and no one had any
     recognised authority. The leaders of the Commune were fighting singly at the barricades, and
     for the time all executive government was at an end. The tumult and excitement at the prison
     was beyond all power of description. Men went and came; orders were given and contradicted;
     women shrieked, some for blood
     <pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7083-252"/> and some for mercy; youths shouted; and through all, and
     above all, we heard the roar of the cannon, the whistling of the shells, and saw the smoke and
     flame of Paris rising up against the sky.</p>
    <p>Joshua, mounted on a gun-barrel, pleaded for the lives of the unfortunate men.</p>
    <p>“The work that the Commune had pledged itself to do,” he said, “was to help on the freedom of
     the working classes, by proving to the world their nobility and power of self-government. The
     slaughter of unarmed men would do none of this. It would give their enemies a just handle
     against them, for it was a baseness unworthy of them—an act neither human nor noble, neither
     righteous nor generous. Whatever the wrong committed by the Government at Versailles, the
     innocent ought not to suffer. Let the Commune
     <pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7083-253"/> mune show itself supreme in virtue at this moment of trial,
     and put the temptation of blood-guiltiness away from it.”</p>
    <p>While he spoke Legros drew his revolver from his belt.</p>
    <p>“Death to the English traitor!” he cried. “Death to the tool of the priests! he believes in
     Jesus Christ!”</p>
    <p>“Christ! we want no Christs here? Death to the traitor!” shouted one or two of the mob.</p>
    <p>Sick with dread for the safety of the man I loved best on earth, I sprang forward and covered
     Joshua's body with my own; when a fine-looking man—he was one of us then, but, as he is now in
     office under Thiers, I will not say who he was—quietly struck the revolver from Legros's
     hand.</p>
    <p>“Keep your bullets for your enemies,
     <pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7083-254"/> fool!—do not give them to your friends,” he said; “this man
     is not a hostage.” Then hurriedly, aside, to Joshua, “Escape while you can; I will cover your
     retreat, and divert their attention.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, that I had the voice of a God to teach them wisdom!” cried Joshua.</p>
    <p>“Pshaw mon ami!” said our friend, contemptuously. “Your best wisdom is now is to save your
     own life—not to try and teach men anything.”</p>
    <p>“Out with you, spies, traitors, priest-ridden Tartuffes! We want no sympathizers with tyranny
     here!” shouted an excited, half-mad looking man close to us. “Out with them, citoyens!”</p>
    <p>And at the word half-a-dozen men and women, shrieking, and gesticulating, laid hands on us
     and roughly thrust us out. I
     <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7083-255"/> thought it fortunate we left with our lives, for indeed, the
     wild, surging crowd was in no mood for mercy just then; and a couple of lives, more or less,
     were of small account at that moment. Howbeit, we were flung out with many a blow and bitter
     word; and just as we were going through the gateway a loud yell burst forth, a volley was
     fired, and we knew that the policy of Versailles had triumphed.</p>
    <p>A few Parisians—<emph>not the Commune</emph>—had fallen into the snare prepared for them; and
     the blood was shed which was to cover Liberty with shame, until men can hear and learn the
     truth.</p>
    <p>The last day came. The guns of our forts were silent; the men were fighting in the streets,
     desperate, conquered, but not craven. The Versaillists were pouring in
     <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7083-256"/> like wolves let loose; Paris was drenched with blood, and in
     flames. And then the cry of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">pétroleuses</foreign> went up like the
     fire that shot against the sky. What mattered it that it was a lie? It gave the Party of Order
     another reason, if they had wanted any, to excuse their lust of blood. It was their saturnalia,
     and they did not stint themselves. The arms, that had served them so ill against the Prussians,
     served them but too well against their countrymen; and the short hour of a nation's hope was at
     an end in the bloody reprisals of brothers, that exceeded all we have ever heard or read of in
     a victorious foreign army.</p>
    <p>I had been separated from my friends for more than twenty-four hours. The house where we had
     lodged was in flames; and when I went to seek information at a Communist
     <pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7083-257"/> munist friend's, De Lancy, I found a group of three by the
     concierge door—himself, his young wife, and a little daughter not two years old, lying as if
     asleep, save for the blood that was their bed. They had been bound together and shot. Not one,
     but hundreds and thousands of such cases stand recorded in the history of that terrible moment,
     when the victorious Versaillists marched into Paris, and society revenged itself on the men who
     had dared to dream of redressing its wrongs; and among the terrible sights that met me, the
     evidences of brutal, wanton, sickening murder, I had a shuddering dread that I should find
     Joshua and Mary. I was never so nearly mad as I was that day when I wandered about the
     bloody-streets of Paris, looking for my friends; sorrow for the lost cause, horror at
     <pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7083-258"/> the scenes I encountered, and fear for those I loved, all
     combining to render life in that hour simply torture.</p>
    <p>At last I caught a glimpse of Mary crossing the street, carrying a wounded child in her arms,
     and making for the ambulance. I called to her, and hurried after her; but, weak as I was with
     excitement and want of food, I could not make my voice reach her.</p>
    <p>Just then, cap in hand and bowing low, Jacques Legros rushed out of a ruined house and
     stopped the captain of a troop that came marching down the street. He pointed in a frantic way
     to Mary.</p>
    <p>“V'la, mon Capitaine,” he said, weeping and sobbing loudly, as one in the greatest distress;
     “c'est la cocotte d'un Communiste Anglais—c'est une pétroleuse! Elle a fait
     <pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7083-259"/> sauter la maison de ma mère. C'est ce que je sais, moi!”</p>
    <p>“Prends-la,” said the Captain in an odd, half bitter, half matter-of-fact way. And Mary was
     seized by a couple of his men, and brought up close to where he stood.</p>
    <p>“C'est une jolie cible, ça!” he said with a brutal laugh. “C'est dommage—une belle fille
     comme ça! Mais on ne doit pas être pétroleuse, ma fille. Fi donc!”</p>
    <p>“I have done no harm,” said Mary, with her wild eyes searching his in vain for pity. “I have
     done only what good I could to all!”</p>
    <p>“Is setting fire to honest women's houses doing good, wretch?” said the Captain, suddenly
     changing his mocking manner for one of ferocious sternness, and speaking in
     <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7083-260"/> broken English. “A pétroleuse?—you are not fit to live!”</p>
    <p>“She is no pétroleuse,” I cried.</p>
    <p>But as I spoke a blow laid me senseless; and when I came to myself I found myself lying
     wounded on the ground, with Mary stretched beside me—shot through the heart.</p>
    <p>It was then night time; but soon after I recovered, and just as I was in the first agony of
     understanding what had happened, Joshua, and the same man who had saved his life at the time of
     the murder of the hostages in the prison, came up to where we lay, searching for us.</p>
    <p>I have no more to tell of this episode. Our Mary was buried tenderly, lovingly; and I laid
     part of my life in her grave. What Joshua felt I never knew exactly.
     <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7083-261"/> He did not say much; and though once I saw him, when he
     thought I was asleep, lay his head on his hands and weep bitterly, he never gave me a hint as
     to whether he was grieving at the loss of Mary, or at the failure of the cause. Whichever it
     was, it nearly broke him down; and ill as I was myself, with a bad wound and a smashed
     collar-bone, I saw that his distress was greater than my own, and needed more consideration. I
     was desperately afraid more than once that he was going to die. For myself, I felt as if I
     could not die while Joshua lived, perhaps to want me.</p>
    <p>However that might be, we neither of us came to grief of that kind. I got well in time; and
     when I could travel, and a fitting opportunity arrived, our friend, who had kept us all this
     time in safety, got us sent off to
     <pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7083-262"/> England. And right glad was I when we landed safe in the Old
     Country once more. Joshua was glad too. He had suffered much from the confinement, inertia, and
     disappointment of the last few weeks;—coming too, after a time of such intense hope and
     excitement; and once in England, he thought he could do something for the Humanity he loved,
     for the Truth to which he had consecrated his life.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7083-263"/>
    <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
    <p>WE found times hard on our return. As for work, it was simply impossible to be had
     where we were known. If Joshua was shunned as a consorter with bad characters when he took
     vicious humanity by the hand, and sought to cleanse the foul and raise the degraded by the
     practical application of Christian precepts unsupported by sectarian organisation, what was he
     now, when besmirched with the Communistic doctrines of liberty, equality, and fraternity?
     Ordinary men thinking ordinary thoughts shrank from him in moral horror. He stood before them
     <pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7083-264"/> as the embodiment of murder and rapine, the representative
     of social destruction and the godless license of anarchy. He was a Communist: and that to most
     men and women of the day, means one wilfully and willingly guilty of every crime under
     heaven.</p>
    <p>“They must be told the truth, John,” he said to me one day; “whether they will accept it or
     not rests with themselves. But the work has to be done, and I have to do it, let what will be
     the result.”</p>
    <p>“It will be a bad one for you, Joshua,” I said.</p>
    <p>“So be it, my son. Preaching the Gospel brought most of the apostles to a bad end—as the
     world counts endings; and I am only following in their steps. I have got my Gospel to preach:
     the same our Master
     <pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7083-265"/> taught, if we could but get the world to see it!”</p>
    <p>But that was just what neither he nor any one else has yet got the world to do, and I doubt
     it will be long before they will.</p>
    <p>Work at the bench being impossible, being indeed scarcely the thing he wanted at this moment,
     Joshua took up again the hungry trade of political lecturer to working men, and went about the
     country explaining the Communistic doctrines, and showing their apostolic origin. His position
     was this. He did not justify all the actions of all the men at the head of affairs during the
     short reign of the Commune in Paris; but he warmly defended the cardinal points of their creed,
     as the logical outcome of Christianity in politics. The abolition of priestly supremacy
     <pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7083-266"/> macy in a man's social and daily life; the rights of labour
     as equal with those of capital; the dignity of humanity, including the doctrine of human
     equality; fraternal care for the poor, and the obligation laid on the strong to help the weak;
     the merely experimental nature of society, whence follows the righteousness of radical changes
     which shall break down the strongholds of tyranny and injustice, and help on general
     amelioration; the iniquity of maintaining the vested rights of wrong; and the right of the
     people to self-government. These were the doctrines he preached; but which he failed to induce
     the world to accept. They called him—as he called himself—a Communist; and the name offended,
     so that they would not listen to any kind of statement.</p>
    <p>“You burnt Paris,” said one. “You murdered
     <pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7083-267"/> dered innocent men,” said another. “You insulted God and
     religion,” said a third. A fourth—“You outraged morality, and lived in the most hideous
     licentiousness.” “You would take our hard-earned savings from us, and reduce all men to one
     level—the idle with the industrious, and the ignorant with the educated,” said a fifth. “You
     would rob the capitalist, and by so doing destroy the very labour you uphold,” said a
     sixth.</p>
    <p>And when he answered—“You mistake; I give up the blunders of the Commune, and the wrong-doing
     of which some of its members were guilty, only suggesting that they did not do all that was
     said of them; as neither did the early Christians slaughter children for their Eucharist, nor
     indulge in gross sin in their love feasts, as the Jews
     <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7083-268"/> said of them; but I maintain the doctrine. Let me set that
     clearly before you, and I will leave the rest to time and God”—as often as not they turned
     against him, and hounded him out of their towns.</p>
    <p>“We want none of your French atheism here,” they said, when they were religiously
     inclined;—“None of your Red-republicanism” when they were conservative.</p>
    <p>But where parties were anything like even enough to get him a handful of sympathizers, there
     was generally a fight; and then the magistrates ordered him out of the place, with insult from
     the bench; and in many towns they refused him permission to speak at all. The very name of the
     Commune is the red rag to English thought; and all reason is lost when it is the question of
     telling the truth about men who tried to get
     <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7083-269"/> the working classes equal rights and recognition with the
     moneyed ones.</p>
    <p>At last we came to a place called Lowbridge, where a friend of ours lived—a member of the
     International; and here Joshua announced himself to give a lecture on Communism, in the Town
     Hall. His programme stated the usual thing, that he, Joshua Davidson, would show how Christ and
     his apostles were Communists, and how they preached the same doctrines which the Commune of
     Paris strove to embody; allowing for the differences of method inherent to the differences of
     social arrangements that have grown up during a lapse of nearly two thousand years.</p>
    <p>The evening came, and Joshua prepared to go to the meeting he had called; and I along with
     him. Our friend had warned
     <pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7083-270"/> him to expect an unfriendly audience; but Joshua was not a
     man to be daunted by a few stern faces; and I do not think I ever saw him so possessed with the
     spirit of what he had set out to teach as he was this evening. Yet also I noticed something in
     him that was not exactly like himself. Grave as he always was, to-night he was grave to
     sadness; a solemn kind of sadness; like a martyr going to his death, steadfast, testifying
     always, but—knowing that he was to die.</p>
    <p>He shook hands with me at the side door cordially before going up, saying, “God bless you,
     John, you have been a true friend to me;” then smiled at me; and, the moment having come,
     stepped on to the platform.</p>
    <p>In the first row, right in front of him, was the former clergyman of Trevalga; him
     <pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7083-271"/> we lads used to call behind his back, “Mr. Grand,” because
     of his pomposity and haughtiness. He had lately been given the rich living of Lowbridge, and
     one or two stately appointments connected with the Cathedral and such like. I do not know what
     they were exactly, but they had made him a man of supreme importance, not only in Lowbridge
     itself, but in all the neighbourhood round about.</p>
    <p>I saw Joshua's face change as he caught the clergyman's eye. It did not change to cowardice,
     but to a kind of eager look, like a man taking hold of an enemy; and then it passed away into
     his usual abstracted unconsciousness of self, as he came quietly to the front and prepared to
     speak. But at the first word there broke out such a tumult as I had never heard in any public
     <pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7083-272"/> meeting, and I have been at a few rough and rowdy ones too.
     The yells, hisses, catcalls, whoopings were indescribable. It was impossible to be heard. I
     believe the roar of a lion would have been overpowered. Joshua stood there quiet and dignified
     as ever, looking straight in among them, waiting for the tumult to cease. It only ceased when
     Mr. Grand rose, and standing up on the chair on which he had been sitting, waved his hand for
     silence.</p>
    <p>“Friends,” he said, “I am glad that by your honest English love of law and God, you have
     shown what you think of the poison this demagogue would have poured into your ears. I know that
     man well,” pointing to Joshua; “I have known him from a boy; and I can bear my testimony to the
     fact that he has been an ill-conditioned,
     <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7083-273"/> presumptuous, insolent fellow from the first. I know that he
     has led an infamous life in London; and that he kept such a disorderly house the police were
     obliged to interfere; and he was imprisoned for the offence. Loose women, thieves, burglars—all
     the scum of the earth have been his chosen companions and, to crown all, he went over to Paris
     at that awful time of the Commune, when, if ever hell was let loose on earth it was then, and
     joined himself to that band of miscreants who disgraced the very name of humanity. And now he
     has the audacity to come before you, honest and sober men of Lowbridge, loving your queen and
     country, abiding by the laws, and fearing Good as I hope you all do. And what for?—to praise
     that pandemonium of vice and crime—the Paris Commune—and blasphemously to
     <pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7083-274"/> liken those fiends in human shape to our Lord and the holy
     apostles; to incite you to a rebellion as bloody as that; and more than all this—to pick your
     pockets of your honest wages, that he, an idle vagabond, who won't work, may wander about the
     country, sowing his poison everywhere, while living on the fat of the land. Give him your
     minds, my men; and let him understand that Lowbridge is not the place for a godless rascal like
     him at any time—and by no means the place for an atheist and a Communist!”</p>
    <p>Then he got down, and the men cheered him as lustily as they had hissed Joshua.</p>
    <p>I will do Mr. Grand the justice to say that I do not think he intended his words should have
     the effect they did have. Gentlefolks do not often incite to riot; and a clergyman does not
     like to be the wirepuller for a murder
     <pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7083-275"/> der. But, maddened by their own misconceptions to begin
     with, and excited still more by their parson's abuse and encouragement to violence as it were,
     the audience lost all self-control. A dozen men leaped on the platform, and in a moment I saw
     Joshua under their feet. It was in vain then for Mr. Grand to cry “Order”—for the two policemen
     at the doors to be sent for—for me to lay about me as hard as I was handled. The men had it all
     their own way. They were the representatives of law and order in their own minds, the champions
     of God and religion, and they regarded it as a sacred duty to take it out of this godless
     anarchist. Beaten, kicked, held back by a dozen or more, I could not help him. They beat me
     first; and then the police beat me, and knocked me about savagely with their truncheons
     <pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7083-276"/> cheons, because I struggled to get free, and to get to
     Joshua. He was lying on the ground, pale and senseless, with a stream of blood slowly flowing
     from his lips; while the men trampled on him and kicked him, and one, with a fearful oath,
     kicked him twice on the head. Suddenly a whisper ran round them, and they all drew a little way
     off; when, at a sign from one of them, the gas was turned down, and the place cleared as if by
     magic. When the lights were up again, and I went to lift him—he was dead.</p>
    <p>I know no more—no more than this, that the man who had lived the life after Christ more
     exactly than any human being ever known to me, who had given himself to humanity and poured out
     his strength like water for the sacred cause, who had been loving, tolerant, pitiful to all—that
     <pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7083-277"/> man was killed by the Christian Party of Order; his memory
     denounced on the one hand as that of a blood-thirsty revolutionist who was justly punished for
     his crimes; on the other, as that of a presumptuous and heretical enthusiast who had insulted
     God and dishonoured the true faith. But the same things were said of the early Christians as
     have been said of him, of the Communists, and of all reformers of all times.</p>
    <p>The world has ever disowned its Best when they came; and every truth has been planted in
     blood, and its first efforts sought to be checked by lies. So let them rest, our martyrs whom
     men do not yet know; as neither did they know eighteen hundred years ago the crucified
     Communist of Galilee—he who dwelt with lepers, made his
     <pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7083-278"/> friends of sinners, and preached against all the
     conventional respectabilities which society then held in honour.</p>
    <p>The death of my friend has left me not only desolate, but uncertain. For I have come round to
     the old starting-point again: Is the Christian world all wrong, or is practical Christianity
     impossible? I see men simply and sincerely devoted to the cause of Humanity, and I hear the
     world's verdict on them. I hear others, earnest for the dogma of Christianity, rabid against
     its acted doctrines. They do not care to destroy the causes of misery by any change in social
     relations; they only attack the sinners for whose sin society is originally responsible. They
     maintain the unrighteous distinctions of caste as a
     <pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7083-279"/> religion; and they denounce as delusion, or impiety, the
     doctrine of universal brotherhood which Christ and His apostles preached and died for. I hear a
     great deal about faith, and the infidel being an accursed thing; but then I see the practical
     Christian, like Joshua, held accursed too. What does it all mean? Let us have something
     definite. If the doctrines of Political Economy are true, if the law of the struggle for
     existence and the survival of the fittest applies absolutely to human society as well as to
     plants and fishes, let us then be frank, and candidly admit that Christianity, in its help to
     the poor and weak and in its patience with the sinner, is a craze; and let us abolish the
     pretence of a faith which influences neither our political institutions nor our social
     arrangements; and
     <pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7083-280"/> which ought not to influence them. If Christ was right,
     modern Christianity is wrong; but if sociology is a scientific truth, then Jesus of Nazareth
     preached and practised not only in vain, but against unchangeable Law.</p>
    <p>Like Joshua in early days, my heart burns within me and my mind is unpiloted and unanchored.
     I cannot, being a Christian, accept the inhumanity of political economy and the obliteration of
     the individual in averages; yet I cannot reconcile modern science with Christ. Everywhere I see
     the sifting of competition, and nowhere Christian protection of weakness; everywhere dogma
     adored, and nowhere Christ realised. And again I ask, Which is true—modern society in its class
     strife and consequent elimination of its weaker elements,
     <pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7083-281"/> or the brotherhood and communism taught by the Jewish
     carpenter of Nazareth? Who will answer me?—who will make the dark thing clear?</p>

     to give the names of any living actors in this history. The scene I am now describing was told
     me by Joshua's mother, who wrote it down as soon, as she got home.</note>
