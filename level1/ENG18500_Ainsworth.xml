    <head>Prologue</head>
    <head>1599</head>
    <head><hi>Dr. Lamb</hi></head>
    <p>The Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the last day of the last year, and two hours
     only were wanting to the birth of another year and of another century.</p>
    <p>The night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of stars paved the deep vault of heaven; the
     crescent moon hung like a silver lamp in the midst of them; a stream of rosy and quivering
     light, issuing from the north, traversed the sky, like the tail of some stupendous comet; while
     from its point of effluence broke forth, ever and anon, coruscations rivalling in splendour and
     variety of hue the most brilliant discharge of fireworks.</p>
    <p>A sharp frost prevailed; but the atmosphere was clear and dry, and neither wind nor snow
     aggravated the wholesome rigour of the season. The water lay in thick congealed masses around
     the conduits and wells, and the buckets were frozen on their stands. The thoroughfares were
     sheeted with ice, and dangerous to horsemen and vehicles; but the footways were firm and
     pleasant to the tread.</p>
    <p>Here and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round which ragged urchins and mendicants
     were collected, roasting fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs, or quaffing deep draughts of
     metheglin and ale out of leathern cups. Crowds were collected in the open places, watching the
     wonders in the heavens, and drawing auguries from them, chiefly sinister, for most of the
     beholders thought the signs portended the speedy death of the queen, and the advent of a new
     monarch from the north—a safe and easy interpretation, considering the advanced age and
     declining health of the illustrious Elizabeth, together with the known appointment of her
     successor, James of Scotland.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the early habits of the times, few persons had retired to rest, an universal
     wish prevailing among the citizens to see the new year in, and welcome the century accompanying
     it. Lights glimmered in most windows, revealing the holly-sprigs and laurel-leaves stuck
     thickly in their diamond panes; while, whenever a door was opened, a ruddy gleam burst across
     the street, and a glance inside the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round the
     glowing hearth, occupied in mirthful sports—fox-i’-th’-hole, blind-man’s buff, or
     shoe-the-mare—or seated at the ample board groaning with Christmas cheer.</p>
    <p>Music and singing were heard at every corner, and bands of comely damsels, escorted by their
     sweethearts, went from house to house, bearing huge brown bowls dressed with ribands and
     rosemary, and filled with a drink called “lamb’s-wool,” composed of sturdy ale, sweetened with
     sugar, spiced with nutmeg, and having toasts and burnt crabs floating within it—a draught from
     which seldom brought its pretty bearers less than a groat, and occasionally a more valuable
     coin.</p>
    <p>Such was the vigil of the year sixteen hundred.</p>
    <p>On this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking and venerable appearance was seen to
     emerge upon a small wooden balcony, projecting from a bay-window near the top of a picturesque
     structure situated at the southern extremity of London Bridge.</p>
    <p>The old man’s beard and hair were as white as snow—the former descending almost to his
     girdle; so were the thick, overhanging brows that shaded his still piercing eyes. His forehead
     was high, bald, and ploughed by innumerable wrinkles. His countenance, despite its death-like
     paleness, had a noble and majestic cast; and his figure, though worn to the bone by a life of
     the severest study, and bent by the weight of years, must have been once lofty and commanding.
     His dress consisted of a doublet and hose of sad-coloured cloth, over which he wore a loose
     gown of black silk. His head was covered by a square black cap, from beneath which his silver
     locks strayed over his shoulders.</p>
    <p>Known by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addicted to alchemical and philosophical pursuits, this
     venerable personage was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a wizard. Strange tales
     were reported and believed of him. Amongst others, it was said that he possessed a familiar,
     because he chanced to employ a deformed, crack-brained dwarf, who assisted him in his
     operations, and whom he appropriately enough denominated Flapdragon.</p>
    <p>Doctor Lamb’s gaze was fixed intently upon the heavens, and he seamed to be noting the
     position of the moon with reference to some particular star.</p>
    <p>After remaining in this posture for a few minutes, he was about to retire, when a loud crash
     arrested him, and he turned to see whence it proceeded.</p>
    <p>Immediately before him stood the Southwark Gateway—a square stone building, with a round,
     embattled turret at each corner, and a flat leaden roof, planted with a forest of poles,
     fifteen or sixteen feet high, garnished with human heads. To his surprise, the doctor perceived
     that two of these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who was in the act of stripping
     them of their grisly burdens.</p>
    <p>Having accomplished his object, the mysterious plunderer thrust his spoil into a leathern bag
     with which he was provided, tied its mouth, and was about to take his departure by means of a
     rope-ladder attached to the battlements, when his retreat was suddenly cut off by the
     gatekeeper, armed with a halberd, and bearing a lantern, who issued from a door opening upon
     the leads.</p>
    <p>The baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the open window at which Doctor Lamb was
     stationed, hurled the sack and its contents through it. He then tried to gain the ladder, but
     was intercepted by the gatekeeper, who dealt him a severe blow on the head with his halberd.
     The plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw his sword; but before he could do so,
     he received a thrust in the side from his opponent. He then fell, and the gatekeeper would have
     repeated the blow, if the doctor had not called to him to desist.</p>
    <p>“Do not kill him, good Baldred,” he cried. “The attempt may not be so criminal as it appears.
     Doubtless, the mutilated remains which the poor wretch has attempted to carry off are those of
     his kindred, and horror at their exposure must have led him to commit the offence.”</p>
    <p>“It may be, doctor,” replied Baldred; “and if so I shall be sorry I have hurt him. But I am
     responsible for the safe custody of these traitorous relics, and it is as much as my own head
     is worth to permit their removal.”</p>
    <p>“I know it,” replied Doctor Lamb; “and you are fully justified in what you have done. It may
     throw some light upon the matter, to know whose miserable remains have been disturbed.”</p>
    <p>“They were the heads of two rank papists,” replied Baldred, “who were decapitated on Tower
     Hill, on Saint Nicholas’s Day, three weeks ago, for conspiring against the queen.”</p>
    <p>“But their names?” demanded the doctor. “How were they called?”</p>
    <p>“They were father and son,” replied Baldred—“Sir Simon Darcy and Master Reginald Darcy.
     Perchance they were known to your worship?”</p>
    <p>“Too well—too well!” replied Doctor Lamb, in a voice of emotion that startled his hearer.
     “They were near kinsmen of mine own. What is he like who has made this strange attempt?”</p>
    <p>“Of a verity, a fair youth,” replied Baldred, holding down the lantern. “Heaven grant I have
     not wounded him to the death! No, his heart still beats. Ha! here are his tablets,” he added,
     taking a small book from his doublet; “these may give the information you seek. You were right
     in your conjecture, doctor. The name herein inscribed is the same as that borne by the
     others—Auriol Darcy.”</p>
    <p>“I see it all,” cried Lamb. “It was a pious and praiseworthy deed. Bring the unfortunate
     youth to my dwelling, Baldred, and you shall be well rewarded. Use despatch, I pray you.”</p>
    <p>As the gatekeeper essayed to comply, the wounded man groaned deeply, as if in great pain.</p>
    <p>“Fling me the weapon with which you smote him,” cried Doctor Lamb, in accents of
     commiseration, “and I will anoint it with the powder of sympathy. His anguish will be speedily
     abated.”</p>
    <p>“I know your worship can accomplish wonders,” cried Baldred, throwing the halberd into the
     balcony. “I will do my part as gently as I can.”</p>
    <p>And as the alchemist took up the weapon, and disappeared through the window, the gatekeeper
     lifted the wounded man by the shoulders, and conveyed him down a narrow, winding staircase to a
     lower chamber. Though he proceeded carefully, the sufferer was put to excruciating pain; and
     when Baldred placed him on a wooden bench, and held a lamp towards him, he perceived that his
     features were darkened and distorted.</p>
    <p>“I fear it’s all over with him,” murmured the gatekeeper; “I shall have a dead body to take
     to Doctor Lamb. It would be a charity to knock him on the head, rather than let him suffer
     thus. The doctor passes for a cunning man, but if he can cure this poor youth without seeing
     him, by the help of his sympathetic ointment, I shall begin to believe, what some folks avouch,
     that he has relations with the devil.”</p>
    <p>While Baldred was ruminating in this manner, a sudden and extraordinary change took place in
     the sufferer. As if by magic, the contraction of the muscles subsided; the features assumed a
     wholesome hue, and the respiration was no longer laborious. Baldred stared as if a miracle had
     been wrought.</p>
    <p>Now that the countenance of the youth had regained its original expression, the gatekeeper
     could not help being struck by its extreme beauty. The face was a perfect oval, with regular
     and delicate features. A short silken moustache covered the upper lip, which was short and
     proud, and a pointed beard terminated the chin. The hair was black, glossy, and cut short, so
     as to disclose a highly intellectual expanse of brow.</p>
    <p>The youth’s figure was slight, but admirably proportioned. His attire consisted of a black
     satin doublet, slashed with white, hose of black silk, and a short velvet mantle. His eyes were
     still closed, and it was difficult to say what effect they might give to the face when they
     lighted it up; but notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to admit that a strange,
     sinister, and almost demoniacal expression pervaded the countenance.</p>
    <p>All at once, and with as much suddenness as his cure had been effected, the young man
     started, uttering a piercing cry, and placed his hand to his side.</p>
    <p>“Caitiff!” he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gatekeeper, “why do you torture me thus?
     Finish me at once—Oh!”</p>
    <p>And overcome by anguish, he sank back again.</p>
    <p>“I have not touched you, sir,” replied Baldred. “I brought you here to succour you. You will
     be easier anon. Doctor Lamb must have wiped the halberd,” he added to himself.</p>
    <p>Another sudden change. The pain fled from the sufferer’s countenance, and he became easy as
     before.</p>
    <p>“What have you done to me?” he asked, with a look of gratitude; “the torture of my wound has
     suddenly ceased, and I feel as if a balm had been dropped into it. Let me remain in this state
     if you have any pity—or despatch me, for my late agony was almost insupportable.”</p>
    <p>“You are cared for by one who has greater skill than any chirurgeon in London,” replied
     Baldred. “If I can manage to transport you to his lodgings, he will speedily heal your
     wounds.”</p>
    <p>“Do not delay, then,” replied Auriol faintly; “for though I am free from pain, I feel that my
     life is ebbing fast away.”</p>
    <p>“Press this handkerchief to your side, and lean on me,” said Baldred. “Doctor Lamb’s dwelling
     is but a step from the gateway—in fact, the first house on the bridge. By the way, the doctor
     declares he is your kinsman.”</p>
    <p>“It is the first I ever heard of him,” replied Auriol faintly; “but take me to him quickly,
     or it will be too late.”</p>
    <p>In another moment they were at the doctor’s door. Baldred tapped against it, and the summons
     was instantly answered by a diminutive personage, clad in a jerkin of coarse grey serge, and
     having a leathern apron tied round his waist. This was Flapdragon.</p>
    <p>Blear-eyed, smoke-begrimed, lantern-jawed, the poor dwarf seemed as if his whole life had
     been spent over the furnace. And so, in fact, it had been. He had become little better than a
     pair of human bellows. In his hand he held the halberd with which Auriol had been wounded.</p>
    <p>“So you have been playing the leech, Flapdragon, eh?” cried Baldred.</p>
    <p>“Ay, marry have I,” replied the dwarf, with a wild grin, and displaying a wolfish set of
     teeth. “My master ordered me to smear the halberd with the sympathetic ointment. I obeyed him:
     rubbed the steel point, first on one side, then on the other; next wiped it; and then smeared
     it again.”</p>
    <p>“Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,” replied Baldred; “but help me to transport
     him to the laboratory.”</p>
    <p>“I know not if the doctor will care to be disturbed,” said Flapdragon. “He is busily engaged
     on a grand operation.”</p>
    <p>“I will take the risk on myself,” said Baldred. “The youth will die if he remains here. See,
     he has fainted already!”</p>
    <p>Thus urged, the dwarf laid down the halberd, and between the two, Auriol was speedily
     conveyed up a wide oaken staircase to the laboratory. Doctor Lamb was plying the bellows at the
     furnace, on which a large alembic was placed, and he was so engrossed by his task that he
     scarcely noticed the entrance of the others.</p>
    <p>“Place the youth on the ground, and rear his head against the chair,” he cried, hastily, to
     the dwarf. “Bathe his brows with the decoction in that crucible. I will attend to him anon.
     Come to me on the morrow, Baldred, and I will repay thee for thy trouble. I am busy now.”</p>
    <p>“These relics, doctor,” cried the gatekeeper, glancing at the bag, which was lying on the
     ground, and from which a bald head protruded—“I ought to take them back with me.”</p>
    <p>“Heed them not—they will be safe in my keeping,” cried Doctor Lamb impatiently;
     “to-morrow—to-morrow.”</p>
    <p>Casting a furtive glance round the laboratory, and shrugging his shoulders, Baldred departed;
     and Flapdragon having bathed the sufferer’s temples with the decoction, in obedience to his
     master’s injunctions, turned to inquire what he should do next.</p>
    <p>“Begone!” cried the doctor, so fiercely that the dwarf darted out of the room, clapping the
     door after him.</p>
    <p>Doctor Lamb then applied himself to his task with renewed ardour, and in a few seconds became
     wholly insensible of the presence of a stranger.</p>
    <p>Revived by the stimulant, Auriol presently opened his eyes, and gazing round the room,
     thought he must be dreaming, so strange and fantastical did all appear. The floor was covered
     with the implements used by the adept—bolt-heads, crucibles, cucurbites, and retorts, scattered
     about without any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a large terrestrial sphere: near it
     was an astrolabe, and near that a heap of disused glass vessels. On the other side lay a black,
     mysterious-looking book, fastened with brazen clasps. Around it were a ram’s horn, a pair of
     forceps, a roll of parchment, a pestle and mortar, and a large plate of copper, graven with the
     mysterious symbols of the Isaical table. Near this was the leathern bag containing the two
     decapitated heads, one of which had burst forth. On a table at the farther end of the room,
     stood a large open volume, with parchment leaves, covered with cabalistical characters,
     referring to the names of spirits. Near it were two parchment scrolls, written in letters,
     respectively denominated by the Chaldaic sages, “the Malachim,” and “the Passing of the River.”
     One of these scrolls was kept in its place by a skull. An ancient and grotesque-looking brass
     lamp, with two snake-headed burners, lighted the room. From the ceiling depended a huge scaly
     sea-monster, with outspread fins, open jaws garnished with tremendous teeth, and great goggling
     eyes. Near it hung a celestial sphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously carved, and
     projected far into the room, was laden with various implements of hermetic science. Above it
     were hung dried bats and flitter-mice, interspersed with the skulls of birds and apes. Attached
     to the chimney-piece was a horary, sculptured in stone, near which hung a large starfish. The
     fireplace was occupied by the furnace, on which, as has been stated, was placed an alembic,
     communicating by means of a long serpentine pipe with a receiver. Within the room were two
     skeletons, one of which, placed behind a curtain in the deep embrasure of the window, where its
     polished bones glistened in the white moonlight, had a horrible effect. The other enjoyed more
     comfortable quarters near the chimney, its fleshless feet dangling down in the smoke arising
     from the furnace.</p>
    <p>Doctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursued his task, though he ever and anon paused, to fling
     certain roots and drugs upon the charcoal. As he did this, various-coloured flames broke
     forth—now blue, now green, now blood-red.</p>
    <p>Tinged by these fires, the different objects in the chamber seemed to take other forms, and
     to become instinct with animation. The gourd-shaped cucurbites were transformed into great
     bloated toads bursting with venom; the long-necked bolt-heads became monstrous serpents; the
     worm-like pipes turned into adders; the alembics looked like plumed helmets; the characters on
     the Isaical table, and those on the parchments, seemed traced in fire, and to be ever changing;
     the sea-monster bellowed and roared, and, flapping his fins, tried to burst from his hook; the
     skeletons wagged their jaws, and raised their fleshless fingers in mockery, while blue lights
     burnt in their eyeless sockets; the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with its
     wings; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of the archfiend presiding over a witches’
     sabbath.</p>
    <p>Auriol’s brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his eyes, to exclude these phantasms from
     his sight. But even thus they pursued him; and he imagined he could hear the infernal riot
     going on around him.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful cry, and, uncovering his eyes, he beheld Doctor Lamb
     pouring the contents of the matrass—a bright, transparent liquid—into a small phial. Having
     carefully secured the bottle with a glass stopper, the old man held it towards the light, and
     gazed at it with rapture.</p>
    <p>“At length,” he exclaimed aloud—“at length, the great work is achieved. With the birth of the
     century now expiring I first saw light, and the draught I hold in my hand shall enable me to
     see the opening of centuries and centuries to come. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar
     stones, and the mercurial stones—prepared according to the instructions of the Rabbi Ben
     Lucca—namely, by the separation of the pure from the impure, the volatilisation of the fixed,
     and the fixing of the volatile—this elixir shall renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and
     give me length of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.”</p>
    <p>While thus speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid, and gazed at it like a Persian
     worshipping the sun.</p>
    <p>“To live for ever!” he cried, after a pause—“to escape the jaws of death just when they are
     opening to devour me!—to be free from all accidents!—’tis a glorious thought! Ha! I bethink me,
     the rabbi said there was <hi>one</hi> peril against which the elixir could not guard
      me—<hi>one</hi> vulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death might reach me!
     What is it!—where can it lie?”</p>
    <p>And he relapsed into deep thought.</p>
    <p>“This uncertainty will poison all my happiness,” he continued; “I shall live in constant
     dread, as of an invisible enemy. But no matter! Perpetual life!—perpetual youth!—what more need
     be desired?”</p>
    <p>“What more, indeed!” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Ha!” exclaimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the wounded man, and concealing the phial
     beneath his gown.</p>
    <p>“Your caution is vain, doctor,” said Auriol. “I have heard what you have uttered. You fancy
     you have discovered the <hi>elixir vitæ</hi>.”</p>
    <p>“Fancy I have discovered it!” cried Doctor Lamb. “The matter is past all doubt. I am the
     possessor of the wondrous secret, which the greatest philosophers of all ages have sought to
     discover—the miraculous preservative of the body against decay.”</p>
    <p>“The man who brought me hither told me you were my kinsman,” said Auriol. “Is it so?”</p>
    <p>“It is,” replied the doctor, “and you shall now learn the connection that subsists between
     us. Look at that ghastly relic,” he added, pointing to the head protruding from the bag: “that
     was once my son Simon. His son’s head is within the sack—your father’s head—so that four
     generations are brought together.”</p>
    <p>“Gracious Heaven!” exclaimed the young man, raising himself on his elbow. “You, then, are my
     great-grandsire. My father supposed you had died in his infancy. An old tale runs in the family
     that you were charged with sorcery, and fled to avoid the stake.”</p>
    <p>“It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at present,” replied the old man, “but I
     need scarcely say that the charge brought against me was false. I have devoted myself to
     abstrusest science, have held commune with the stars, and have wrested the most hidden secrets
     from Nature—but that is all. Two crimes alone have stained my soul; but both, I trust, have
     been expiated by repentance.”</p>
    <p>“Were they deeds of blood?” asked Auriol.</p>
    <p>“One was so,” replied Darcy, with a shudder. “It was a cowardly and treacherous deed,
     aggravated by the basest ingratitude. Listen, and you shall hear how it chanced. A Roman rabbi,
     named Ben Lucca, skilled in hermetic science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I
     sought him out, offering myself as his disciple. For months, I remained with him in his
     laboratory—working at the furnace, and poring over mystic lore. One night he showed me that
     volume, and, pointing to a page within it, said: ‘Those characters contain the secret of
     confecting the elixir of life. I will now explain them to you, and afterwards we will proceed
     to the operation.’ With this, he unfolded the mystery; but he bade me observe, that the
     menstruum was defective on one point. Wherefore, he said, ‘there will still be peril from some
     hidden cause.’ Oh, with what greediness I drank in his words! How I gazed at the mystic
     characters, as he explained their import! What visions floated before me of perpetual youth and
     enjoyment. At that moment a demon whispered in my ear, ‘This secret must be thine own. No one
     else must possess it.’”</p>
    <p>“Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, starting.</p>
    <p>“The evil thought was no sooner conceived than acted upon,” pursued Darcy. “Instantly drawing
     my poniard, I plunged it to the rabbi’s heart. But mark what followed. His blood fell upon the
     book, and obliterated the characters; nor could I by any effort of memory recall the
     composition of the elixir.”</p>
    <p>“When did you regain the secret?” asked Auriol curiously.</p>
    <p>“To-night,” replied Darcy—“within this hour. For nigh fifty years after that fatal night I
     have been making fruitless experiments. A film of blood has obscured my mental sight. I have
     proceeded by calcitration, solution, putrefaction—have produced the oils which will fix crude
     mercury, and convert all bodies into sol and luna; but I have ever failed in fermenting the
     stone into the true elixir. To-night, it came into my head to wash the blood-stained page
     containing the secret with a subtle liquid. I did so; and doubting the efficacy of the
     experiment, left it to work, while I went forth to breathe the air at my window. My eyes were
     cast upwards, and I was struck with the malignant aspect of my star. How to reconcile this with
     the good fortune which has just befallen me, I know not—but so it was. At this juncture, your
     rash but pious attempt occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined the
     gatekeeper to bring you hither, I returned to my old laboratory. On glancing towards the mystic
     volume, what was my surprise to see the page free from blood!”</p>
    <p>Auriol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the book with superstitious awe.</p>
    <p>“The sight was so surprising that I dropped the sack I had brought with me,” pursued Darcy.
     “Fearful of again losing the secret, I nerved myself to the task, and placing fuel on the fire,
     dismissed my attendant with brief injunctions relative to you. I then set to work. How I have
     succeeded, you perceive. I hold in my hand the treasure I have so long sought—so eagerly
     coveted. The whole world’s wealth should not purchase it from me.”</p>
    <p>Auriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said nothing.</p>
    <p>“In a few moments I shall be as full of vigour and activity as yourself,” continued Darcy.
     “We shall be no longer the great-grandsire and his descendant, but
     friends—companions—equals,—equals in age, strength, activity, beauty, fortune—for youth
      <hi>is</hi> fortune—ha! ha! Methinks I am already young again!”</p>
    <p>“You spoke of two crimes with which your conscience was burdened,” remarked Auriol. “You have
     mentioned but one.”</p>
    <p>“The other was not so foul as that I have described,” replied Darcy, in an altered tone,
     “inasmuch as it was unintentional, and occasioned by no base motive. My wife, your ancestress,
     was a most lovely woman, and so passionately was I enamoured of her, that I tried by every art
     to heighten and preserve her beauty. I fed her upon the flesh of capons, nourished with vipers;
     caused her to steep her lovely limbs in baths distilled from roses and violets; and had
     recourse to the most potent cosmetics. At last I prepared a draught from poisons—yes,
      <hi>poisons</hi>—the effect of which, I imagined, would be wondrous. She drank it, and expired
     horribly disfigured. Conceive my despair at beholding the fair image of my idolatry
     destroyed—defaced by my hand. In my frenzy I should have laid violent hands upon myself, if I
     had not been restrained. Love may again rule my heart—beauty may again dazzle my eyes, but I
     shall never more feel the passion I entertained for my lost Amice—never more behold charms
     equal to hers.”</p>
    <p>And he pressed his hand to his face.</p>
    <p>“The mistake you then committed should serve as a warning,” said Auriol. “What if it be
     poison you have now confected? Try a few drops of it on some animal.”</p>
    <p>“No—no; it is the true elixir,” replied Darcy. “Not a drop must be wasted. You will witness
     its effect anon. Like the snake, I shall cast my slough, and come forth younger than I was at
     twenty.”</p>
    <p>“Meantime, I beseech you to render me some assistance,” groaned Auriol, “or, while you are
     preparing for immortality, I shall expire before your eyes.”</p>
    <p>“Be not afraid,” replied Darcy; “you shall take no harm. I will care for you presently; and I
     understand leechcraft so well, that I will answer for your speedy and perfect recovery.”</p>
    <p>“Drink, then, to it!” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“I know not what stays my hand,” said the old man, raising the phial; “but now that
     immortality is in my reach, I dare not grasp it.”</p>
    <p>“Give me the potion, then,” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Not for worlds,” rejoined Darcy, hugging the phial to his breast. “No; I will be young
     again—rich—happy. I will go forth into the world—I will bask in the smiles of beauty—I will
     feast, revel, sing—life shall be one perpetual round of enjoyment. Now for the trial—ha!” and,
     as he raised the potion towards his lips, a sudden pang shot across his heart. “What is this?”
     he cried, staggering. “Can death assail me when I am just about to enter upon perpetual life?
     Help me, good grandson! Place the phial to my lips. Pour its contents down my throat—quick!
     quick!”</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>“I am too weak to stir,” groaned Auriol. “You have delayed it too long.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, heavens! we shall both perish,” shrieked Darcy, vainly endeavouring to raise his palsied
     arm,—“perish with the blissful shore in view.”</p>
    <p>And he sank backwards, and would have fallen to the ground if he had not caught at the
     terrestrial sphere for support.</p>
    <p>“Help me—help me!” he screamed, fixing a glance of unutterable anguish on his relative.</p>
    <p>“It is worth the struggle,” cried Auriol. And, by a great effort, he raised himself, and
     staggered towards the old man.</p>
    <p>“Saved—saved!” shrieked Darcy. “Pour it down my throat. An instant, and all will be
     well.”</p>
    <p>“Think you I have done this for you?” cried Auriol, snatching the potion; “no—no.”</p>
    <p>And, supporting himself against the furnace, he placed the phial to his lips, and eagerly
     drained its contents.</p>
    <p>The old man seemed paralysed by the action, but kept his eye fixed upon the youth till he had
     drained the elixir to the last drop. He then uttered a piercing cry, threw up his arms, and
     fell heavily backwards.</p>
    <p>Dead—dead!</p>
    <p>Flashes of light passed before Auriol’s eyes, and strange noises smote his ears. For a moment
     he was bewildered as with wine, and laughed and sang discordantly like a madman. Every object
     reeled and danced around him. The glass vessels and jars clashed their brittle sides together,
     yet remained uninjured; the furnace breathed forth flames and mephitic vapours; the spiral worm
     of the alembic became red hot, and seemed filled with molten lead; the pipe of the bolt-head
     ran blood; the sphere of the earth rolled along the floor, and rebounded from the wall as if
     impelled by a giant hand; the skeletons grinned and gibbered; so did the death’s-head on the
     table; so did the skulls against the chimney; the monstrous sea-fish belched forth fire and
     smoke; the bald, decapitated head opened its eyes, and fixed them, with a stony glare, on the
     young man; while the dead alchemist shook his hand menacingly at him.</p>
    <p>Unable to bear these accumulated horrors, Auriol became, for a short space, insensible. On
     recovering, all was still. The lights within the lamp had expired; but the bright moonlight,
     streaming through the window, fell upon the rigid features of the unfortunate alchemist, and on
     the cabalistic characters of the open volume beside him.</p>
    <p>Eager to test the effect of the elixir, Auriol put his hand to his side. All traces of the
     wound were gone; nor did he experience the slightest pain in any other part of his body. On the
     contrary, he seemed endowed with preternatural strength. His breast dilated with rapture, and
     he longed to expand his joy in active motion.</p>
    <p>Striding over the body of his aged relative, he threw open the window. As he did so, joyous
     peals burst from surrounding churches, announcing the arrival of the new year.</p>
    <p>While listening to this clamour, Auriol gazed at the populous and picturesque city stretched
     out before him, and bathed in the moonlight.</p>
    <p>“A hundred years hence,” he thought, “and scarcely one soul of the thousands within those
     houses will be living, save myself. A hundred years after that, and their children’s children
     will be gone to the grave. But I shall live on—shall live through all changes—all customs—all
     time. What revelations I shall then have to make, if I should dare to disclose them!”</p>
    <p>As he ruminated thus, the skeleton hanging near him was swayed by the wind, and its bony
     fingers came in contact with his cheek. A dread idea was suggested by the occurrence.</p>
    <p>“There is one peril to be avoided,” he thought; ”ONE PERIL!—what is it? Pshaw! I will think
     no more of it. It may never arise. I will be gone. This place fevers me.”</p>
    <p>With this, he left the laboratory, and hastily descending the stairs, at the foot of which he
     found Flapdragon, passed out of the house.</p>

    <head>Chapter 1</head>
    <head>The Ruined House in the Vauxhall Road</head>
    <p>Late one night, in the spring of 1830, two men issued from a low, obscurely situated
     public-house, near Millbank, and shaped their course apparently in the direction of Vauxhall
     Bridge. Avoiding the footpath near the river, they moved stealthily along the farther side of
     the road, where the open ground offered them an easy means of flight, in case such a course
     should be found expedient. So far as it could be discerned by the glimpses of the moon, which
     occasionally shone forth from a rack of heavy clouds, the appearance of these personages was
     not much in their favour. Haggard features, stamped deeply with the characters of crime and
     debauchery; fierce, restless eyes; beards of several days’ growth; wild, unkempt heads of hair,
     formed their chief personal characteristics; while sordid and ragged clothes, shoes without
     soles, and old hats without crowns, constituted the sum of their apparel.</p>
    <p>One of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and feet; but despite his meagreness, he
     evidently possessed great strength: the other was considerably shorter, but broad-shouldered,
     bow-legged, long-armed, and altogether a most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high
     cheek-bones, a long aquiline nose, and a coarse mouth and chin, in which the animal greatly
     predominated. He had a stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white brows and eyelashes. The
     countenance of the other was dark and repulsive, and covered with blotches, the result of
     habitual intemperance. His eyes had a leering and malignant look. A handkerchief spotted with
     blood, and tied across his brow, contrasted strongly with his matted black hair, and increased
     his natural appearance of ferocity. The shorter ruffian carried a mallet upon his shoulder, and
     his companion concealed something beneath the breast of his coat, which afterwards proved to be
     a dark lantern.</p>
    <p>Not a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant look-out, they trudged on with quick,
     shambling steps. A few sounds arose from the banks of the river, and there was now and then a
     plash in the water, or a distant cry, betokening some passing craft; but generally all was
     profoundly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the opposite bank, the line of
     coal-barges and lighters moored to the strand, the great timber-yards and coal-yards, the
     brewhouses, gasworks, and waterworks, could only be imperfectly discerned; but the moonlight
     fell clear upon the ancient towers of Lambeth Palace, and on the neighbouring church. The same
     glimmer also ran like a silver belt across the stream, and revealed the great, stern,
     fortress-like pile of the Penitentiary—perhaps the most dismal-looking structure in the whole
     metropolis. The world of habitations beyond this melancholy prison was buried in darkness. The
     two men, however, thought nothing of these things, and saw nothing of them; but, on arriving
     within a couple of hundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by previous concert, quitted
     the road, and, leaping a rail, ran across a field, and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried
     pit, where they came to a momentary halt.</p>
    <p>“You ain’t a-been a-gammonin’ me in this matter, Tinker?” observed the shorter individual.
     “The cove’s sure to come?”</p>
    <p>“Why, you can’t expect me to answer for another as I can for myself, Sandman,” replied the
     other; “but if his own word’s to be taken for it, he’s sartin to be there. I heerd him say, as
     plainly as I’m a speakin’ to you—‘I’ll be here to-morrow night—at the same hour——’”</p>
    <p>“And that wos one o’clock?” said the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Thereabouts,” replied the other.</p>
    <p>“And who did he say that to?” demanded the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“To hisself, I s’pose,” answered the Tinker; “for, as I told you afore, I could see no one
     vith him.”</p>
    <p>“Do you think he’s one of our perfession?” inquired the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Bless you! no—that he ain’t,” returned the Tinker. “He’s a reg’lar slap-up svell.”</p>
    <p>“That’s no reason at all,” said the Sandman. “Many a first-rate svell practises in our line.
     But he can’t be in his right mind to come to such a ken as that, and go on as you
     mentions.”</p>
    <p>“As to that I can’t say,” replied the Tinker; “and it don’t much matter, as far as ve’re
     consarned.”</p>
    <p>“Devil a bit,” rejoined the Sandman, “except—you’re sure it worn’t a sperrit, Tinker. I’ve
     heerd say that this crib is haanted, and though I don’t fear no livin’ man, a ghost’s a
     different sort of customer.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, you’ll find our svell raal flesh and blood, you may depend upon it,” replied the
     Tinker. “So come along, and don’t let’s be frightenin’ ourselves vith ould vimen’s tales.”</p>
    <p>With this they emerged from the pit, crossed the lower part of the field, and entered a
     narrow thoroughfare, skirted by a few detached houses, which brought them into the Vauxhall
     Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>Here they kept on the side of the street most in shadow, and crossed over whenever they came
     to a lamp. By-and-by, two watchmen were seen advancing from Belvoir Terrace, and, as the
     guardians of the night drew near, the ruffians crept into an alley to let them pass. As soon as
     the coast was clear, they ventured forth, and quickening their pace, came to a row of deserted
     and dilapidated houses. This was their destination.</p>
    <p>The range of habitations in question, more than a dozen in number, were, in all probability,
     what is vulgarly called “in Chancery,” and shared the fate of most property similarly
     circumstanced. They were in a sad ruinous state—unroofed, without windows and floors. The bare
     walls were alone left standing, and these were in a very tumble-down condition. These neglected
     dwellings served as receptacles for old iron, blocks of stone and wood, and other ponderous
     matters. The aspect of the whole place was so dismal and suspicious, that it was generally
     avoided by passengers after nightfall.</p>
    <p>Skulking along the blank and dreary walls, the Tinker, who was now a little in advance,
     stopped before a door, and pushing it open, entered the dwelling. His companion followed
     him.</p>
    <p>The extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects which met the gaze of the Sandman,
     coupled with the deserted appearance of the place, produced an effect upon his hardy but
     superstitious nature.</p>
    <p>Looking round, he beheld huge mill-stones, enormous water-wheels, boilers of steam-engines,
     iron vats, cylinders, cranes, iron pumps of the strangest fashion, a gigantic pair of wooden
     scales, old iron safes, old boilers, old gas-pipes, old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old
     bird-cages, old plates of iron, old pulleys, ropes, and rusty chains, huddled and heaped
     together in the most fantastic disorder. In the midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded
     and colossal head of Neptune, which had once decorated the forepart of a man-of-war. Above it,
     on a sort of framework, lay the prostrate statue of a nymph, together with a bust of Fox, the
     nose of the latter being partly demolished, and the eyes knocked in. Above these, three garden
     divinities laid their heads amicably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian warrior, minus
     the head and right hand. The whole was surmounted by an immense ventilator, stuck on the end of
     an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor, from the steam-engine pump.</p>
    <p>Seen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects above enumerated produced a
     strange effect upon the beholder’s imagination. There was a mixture of the grotesque and
     terrible about them. Nor was the building itself devoid of a certain influence upon his mind.
     The ragged brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the semblance of a human face, and
     seemed to keep a wary eye on what was going forward below.</p>
    <p>A means of crossing from one side of the building to the other, without descending into the
     vault beneath, was afforded by a couple of planks; though as the wall on the farther side was
     some feet higher than that near at hand, and the planks were considerably bent, the passage
     appeared hazardous.</p>
    <p>Glancing round for a moment, the Tinker leaped into the cellar, and, unmasking his lantern,
     showed a sort of hiding-place, between a bulk of timber and a boiler, to which he invited his
     companion.</p>
    <p>The Sandman jumped down.</p>
    <p>“The ale I drank at the ‘Two Fighting Cocks’ has made me feel drowsy, Tinker,” he remarked,
     stretching himself on the bulk; “I’ll just take a snooze. Vake me up if I snore—or ven our
     sperrit appears.”</p>
    <p>The Tinker replied in the affirmative; and the other had just become lost to consciousness,
     when he received a nudge in the side, and his companion whispered—“He’s here!”</p>
    <p>“Vhere—vhere?” demanded the Sandman, in some trepidation.</p>
    <p>“Look up, and you’ll see him,” replied the other.</p>
    <p>Slightly altering his position, the Sandman caught sight of a figure standing upon the planks
     above them. It was that of a young man. His hat was off, and his features, exposed to the full
     radiance of the moon, looked deathly pale, and though handsome, had a strange sinister
     expression. He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned; and the general cut of his attire, the
     tightly-buttoned, single-breasted coat, together with the moustache upon his lip, gave him a
     military air.</p>
    <p>“He seems a-valkin’ in his sleep,” muttered the Sandman. “He’s a-speakin’ to some von
     unwisible.”</p>
    <p>“Hush—hush!” whispered the other. “Let’s hear wot he’s a-sayin’.”</p>
    <p>“Why have you brought me here?” cried the young man, in a voice so hollow that it thrilled
     his auditors. “What is to be done?”</p>
    <p>“It makes my blood run cold to hear him,” whispered the Sandman. “Vot d’ye think he
     sees?”</p>
    <p>“Why do you not speak to me?” cried the young man—“why do you beckon me forward? Well, I
     obey. I will follow you.”</p>
    <p>And he moved slowly across the plank.</p>
    <p>“See, he’s a-goin’ through that door,” cried the Tinker. “Let’s foller him.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t half like it,” replied the Sandman, his teeth chattering with apprehension. “We
     shall see summat as’ll take avay our senses.”</p>
    <p>“Tut!” cried the Tinker; “it’s only a sleepy-valker. Wot are you afeerd on?”</p>
    <p>With this he vaulted upon the planks, and peeping cautiously out of the open door to which
     they led, saw the object of his scrutiny enter the adjoining house through a broken window.</p>
    <p>Making a sign to the Sandman, who was close at his heels, the Tinker crept forward on all
     fours, and, on reaching the window, raised himself just sufficiently to command the interior of
     the dwelling. Unfortunately for him, the moon was at this moment obscured, and he could
     distinguish nothing except the dusky outline of the various objects with which the place was
     filled, and which were nearly of the same kind as those of the neighbouring habitation. He
     listened intently, but not the slightest sound reached his ears.</p>
    <p>After some time spent in this way, he began to fear the young man must have departed, when
     all at once a piercing scream resounded through the dwelling. Some heavy matter was dislodged,
     with a thundering crash, and footsteps were heard approaching the window.</p>
    <p>Hastily retreating to their former hiding-place, the Tinker and his companion had scarcely
     regained it, when the young man again appeared on the plank. His demeanour had undergone a
     fearful change. He staggered rather than walked, and his countenance was even paler than
     before. Having crossed the plank, he took his way along the top of the broken wall towards the
     door.</p>
    <p>“Now, then, Sandman!” cried the Tinker; “now’s your time!”</p>
    <p>The other nodded, and, grasping his mallet with a deadly and determined purpose, sprang
     noiselessly upon the wall, and overtook his intended victim just before he gained the door.</p>
    <p>Hearing a sound behind him, the young man turned, and only just became conscious of the
     presence of the Sandman, when the mallet descended upon his head, and he fell crushed and
     senseless to the ground.</p>

    <p>“The vork’s done!” cried the Sandman to his companion, who instantly came up with the dark
     lantern; “let’s take him below, and strip him.”</p>
    <p>“Agreed,” replied the Tinker; “but first let’s see wot he has got in his pockets.”</p>
    <p>“Vith all my ‘art,” replied the Sandman, searching the clothes of the victim. “A reader!—I
     hope it’s well lined. Ve’ll examine it below. The body ‘ud tell awkvard tales if any von should
     chance to peep in.”</p>
    <p>“Shall we strip him here?” said the Tinker. “Now the darkey shines on ’em, you see what
     famous togs the cull has on.”</p>
    <p>“Do you vant to have us scragged, fool?” cried the Sandman, springing into the vault. “Hoist
     him down here.”</p>
    <p>With this, he placed the wounded man’s legs over his own shoulders, and, aided by his
     comrade, was in the act of heaving down the body, when the street-door suddenly flew open, and
     a stout individual, attended by a couple of watchmen, appeared at it.</p>
    <p>“There the villains are!” shouted the new-comer. “They have been murderin’ a gentleman. Seize
     ’em—seize ’em!”</p>
    <p>And, as he spoke, he discharged a pistol, the ball from which whistled past the ears of the
     Tinker.</p>
    <p>Without waiting for another salute of the same kind, which might possibly be nearer its mark,
     the ruffian kicked the lantern into the vault, and sprang after the Sandman, who had already
     disappeared.</p>
    <p>Acquainted with the intricacies of the place, the Tinker guided his companion through a hole
     into an adjoining vault, whence they scaled a wall, got into the next house, and passing
     through an open window, made good their retreat, while the watchmen were vainly searching for
     them under every bulk and piece of iron.</p>
    <p>“Here, watchmen!” cried the stout individual, who had acted as leader; “never mind the
     villains just now, but help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house, where proper
     assistance can be rendered him. He still breathes; but he has received a terrible blow on the
     head. I hope his skull ain’t broken.”</p>
    <p>“It is to be hoped it ain’t, Mr. Thorneycroft,” replied the foremost watchman; “but them was
     two desperate characters as ever I see, and capable of any hatterosity.”</p>
    <p>“What a frightful scream I heard to be sure!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft. “I was certain
     somethin’ dreadful was goin’ on. It was fortunate I wasn’t gone to bed; and still more
     fortunate you happened to be comin’ up at the time. But we mustn’t stand chatterin’ here. Bring
     the poor young gentleman along.”</p>
    <p>Preceded by Mr. Thorneycroft, the watchmen carried the wounded man across the road towards a
     small house, the door of which was held open by a female servant, with a candle in her hand.
     The poor woman uttered a cry of horror as the body was brought in.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be cryin’ out in that way, Peggy,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft, “but go and get me some
     brandy. Here, watchmen, lay the poor young gentleman down on the sofa—there, gently, gently.
     And now, one of you run to Wheeler Street, and fetch Mr. Howell, the surgeon. Less noise,
     Peggy—less noise, or you’ll waken Miss Ebba, and I wouldn’t have her disturbed for the
     world.”</p>
    <p>With this, he snatched the bottle of brandy from the maid, filled a wine-glass with the
     spirit, and poured it down the throat of the wounded man. A stifling sound followed, and after
     struggling violently for respiration for a few seconds, the patient opened his eyes.</p>

    <head>The Dog-fancier</head>
    <p>The Rookery! Who that has passed Saint Giles’s, on the way to the city, or coming from it,
     but has caught a glimpse, through some narrow opening, of its squalid habitations, and wretched
     and ruffianly occupants! Who but must have been struck with amazement, that such a huge
     receptacle of vice and crime should be allowed to exist in the very heart of the metropolis,
     like an ulcerated spot, capable of tainting the whole system! Of late, the progress of
     improvement has caused its removal; but whether any less cogent motive would have abated the
     nuisance may be questioned. For years the evil was felt and complained of, but no effort was
     made to remedy it, or to cleanse these worse than Augean stables. As the place is now
     partially, if not altogether, swept away, and a wide and airy street passes through the midst
     of its foul recesses, a slight sketch may be given of its former appearance.</p>
    <p>Entering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross-bars, a few steps from the crowded
     thoroughfare brought you into a frightful region, the refuge, it was easy to perceive, of half
     the lawless characters infesting the metropolis. The coarsest ribaldry assailed your ears, and
     noisome odours afflicted your sense of smell. As you advanced, picking your way through kennels
     flowing with filth, or over putrescent heaps of rubbish and oyster-shells, all the repulsive
     and hideous features of the place were displayed before you. There was something savagely
     picturesque in the aspect of the place, but its features were too loathsome to be regarded with
     any other feeling than disgust. The houses looked as sordid, and as thickly crusted with the
     leprosy of vice, as their tenants. Horrible habitations they were, in truth. Many of them were
     without windows, and where the frames were left, brown paper or tin supplied the place of
     glass; some even wanted doors, and no effort was made to conceal the squalor within. On the
     contrary, it seemed to be intruded on observation. Miserable rooms, almost destitute of
     furniture; floors and walls caked with dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints; shameless
     and abandoned-looking women; children without shoes and stockings, and with scarcely a rag to
     their backs: these were the chief objects that met the view. Of men, few were visible—the
     majority being out on business, it is to be presumed; but where a solitary straggler was seen,
     his sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping with the spot. So thickly inhabited
     were these wretched dwellings, that every chamber, from garret to cellar, swarmed with inmates.
     As to the cellars, they looked like dismal caverns, which a wild beast would shun.
     Clothes-lines were hung from house to house, festooned with every kind of garment. Out of the
     main street branched several alleys and passages, all displaying the same degree of misery, or,
     if possible, worse, and teeming with occupants. Personal security, however, forbade any attempt
     to track these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen afforded, could easily picture
     them. It was impossible to move a step without insult or annoyance. Every human being seemed
     brutalised and degraded; and the women appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street
     ring with their cries, their quarrels, and their imprecations. It was a positive relief to
     escape from this hotbed of crime to the world without, and breathe a purer atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Such being the aspect of the Rookery in the daytime, what must it have been when crowded with
     its denizens at night! Yet at such an hour it will now be necessary to enter its
     penetralia.</p>
    <p>After escaping from the ruined house in the Vauxhall Road, the two ruffians shaped their
     course towards Saint Giles’s, running the greater part of the way, and reaching the Broadway
     just as the church clock struck two. Darting into a narrow alley, and heedless of any
     obstructions they encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat wider cross-street, which
     they pursued for a short distance, and then struck into an entry, at the bottom of which was a
     swing-door that admitted them into a small court, where they found a dwarfish person wrapped in
     a tattered watchman’s greatcoat, seated on a stool with a horn lantern in his hand and a cutty
     in his mouth, the glow of which lighted up his hard, withered features. This was the
     deputy-porter of the lodging-house they were about to enter. Addressing him by the name of Old
     Parr, the ruffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another door, entered a sort of kitchen,
     at the farther end of which blazed a cheerful fire, with a large copper kettle boiling upon it.
     On one side of the room was a deal table, round which several men of sinister aspect and sordid
     attire were collected, playing, at cards. A smaller table of the same material stood near the
     fire, and opposite it was a staircase leading to the upper rooms. The place was dingy and dirty
     in the extreme, the floors could not have been scoured for years, and the walls were begrimed
     with filth. In one corner, with his head resting on a heap of coals and coke, lay a boy almost
     as black as a chimney-sweep, fast asleep. He was the waiter. The principal light was afforded
     by a candle stuck against the wall, with a tin reflector behind it. Before the fire, with his
     back turned towards it, stood a noticeable individual, clad in a velveteen jacket with ivory
     buttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees, a faded black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and
     a pair of ancient Wellingtons ascending half-way up his legs, which looked disproportionately
     thin when compared with the upper part of his square, robustious, and somewhat pursy frame. His
     face was broad, jolly, and good-humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light
     grey eyes, glistening with cunning and roguery. His hair, which dangled in long flakes over his
     ears and neck, was of a dunnish red, as were also his whiskers and beard. A superannuated white
     castor, with a black hat-band round it, was cocked knowingly on one side of his head, and gave
     him a flashy and sporting look. His particular vocation was made manifest by the number of dogs
     he had about him. A beautiful black-and-tan spaniel, of Charles the Second’s breed, popped its
     short snubby nose and long silken ears out of each coat-pocket. A pug was thrust into his
     breast, and he carried an exquisite Blenheim under either arm. At his feet reposed an Isle of
     Skye terrier, and a partly cropped French poodle, of snowy whiteness, with a red worsted riband
     round his throat. This person, it need scarcely be said, was a dog-fancier, or, in other words,
     a dealer in, and a stealer of, dogs, as well as a practiser of all the tricks connected with
     that nefarious trade. His self-satisfied air made it evident he thought himself a smart, clever
     fellow,—and adroit and knavish he was, no doubt,—while his droll, plausible, and rather winning
     manners helped him materially to impose upon his customers. His real name was Taylor, but he
     was known among his companions by the appellation of Ginger. On the entrance of the Sandman and
     the Tinker, he nodded familiarly to them, and with a sly look inquired—“Vell, my ‘arties—wot
     luck?”</p>
    <p>“Oh, pretty middlin’,” replied the Sandman gruffly.</p>
    <p>And seating himself at the table, near the fire, he kicked up the lad, who was lying fast
     asleep on the coals, and bade him fetch a pot of half-and-half. The Tinker took a place beside
     him, and they waited in silence the arrival of the liquor, which, when it came, was disposed of
     at a couple of pulls; while Mr. Ginger, seeing they were engaged, sauntered towards the
     card-table, attended by his four-footed companions.</p>
    <p>“And now,” said the Sandman, unable to control his curiosity longer, and taking out his
     pocket-book, “we’ll see what fortun’ has given us.”</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>So saying, he unclasped the pocket-book, while the Tinker bent over him in eager curiosity.
     But their search for money was fruitless. Not a single bank-note was forthcoming. There were
     several memoranda and slips of paper, a few cards, and an almanac for the year—that was all. It
     was a great disappointment.</p>
    <p>“So we’ve had all this trouble for nuffin’, and nearly got shot into the bargain,” cried the
     Sandman, slapping down the book on the table with an oath. “I vish I’d never undertaken the
     job.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t let’s give it up in sich an ‘urry,” replied the Tinker; “summat may be made on it yet.
     Let’s look over them papers.”</p>
    <p>“Look ’em over yourself,” rejoined the Sandman, pushing the book towards him. “I’ve done wi’
     ’em. Here, lazy-bones, bring two glasses o’ rum-and-water—stiff, d’ye hear?”</p>
    <p>While the sleepy youth bestirred himself to obey these injunctions, the Tinker read over
     every memorandum in the pocket-book, and then proceeded carefully to examine the different
     scraps of paper with which it was filled. Not content with one perusal, he looked them all over
     again, and then began to rub his hands with great glee.</p>
    <p>“Wot’s the matter?” cried the Sandman, who had lighted a cutty, and was quietly smoking it.
     “Wot’s the row, eh?”</p>
    <p>“Vy, this is it,” replied the Tinker, unable to contain his satisfaction; “there’s secrets
     contained in this here pocket-book as’ll be worth a hundred pound and better to us. We ha’n’t
     had our trouble for nuffin’.”</p>
    <p>“Glad to hear it!” said the Sandman, looking hard at him. “Wot kind o’ secrets are they?”</p>
    <p>“Vy, <hi>hangin’ secrets</hi>,” replied the Tinker, with mysterious emphasis. “He seems to be
     a terrible chap, and to have committed murder wholesale.”</p>
    <p>“Wholesale!” echoed the Sandman, removing the pipe from his lips. “That sounds awful. But
     what a precious donkey he must be to register his crimes i’ that way.”</p>
    <p>“He didn’t expect the pocket-book to fall into our hands,” said the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Werry likely not,” replied the Sandman; “but somebody else might see it. I repeat, he must
     be a fool. S’pose we wos to make a entry of everythin’ we does. Wot a nice balance there’d be
     agin us ven our accounts comed to be wound up!”</p>
    <p>“Ourn is a different bus’ness altogether,” replied the Tinker. “This seems a werry mysterious
     sort o’ person. Wot age should you take him to be?”</p>
    <p>“Vy, five-an’-twenty at the outside,” replied the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Five-an’-sixty ‘ud be nearer the mark,” replied the Tinker. “There’s dates as far back as
     that.”</p>
    <p>“Five-an’-sixty devils!” cried the Sandman; “there must be some mistake i’ the reckonin’
     there.”</p>
    <p>“No, it’s all clear an’ reg’lar,” rejoined the other; “and that doesn’t seem to be the end of
     it neither. I looked over the papers twice, and one, dated 1780, refers to some other
     dokiments.”</p>
    <p>“They must relate to his granddad, then,” said the Sandman; “it’s impossible they can refer
     to him.”</p>
    <p>“But I tell ‘ee they <hi>do</hi> refer to him,” said the Tinker, somewhat angrily, at having
     his assertion denied; “at least, if his own word’s to be taken. Anyhow, these papers is
     waluable to us. If no one else believes in ’em, it’s clear he believes in ’em hisself, and will
     be glad to buy ’em from us.”</p>
    <p>“That’s a view o’ the case worthy of an Old Bailey lawyer,” replied the Sandman. “Wot’s the
     gemman’s name?”</p>
    <p>“The name on the card is Auriol Darcy,” replied the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Any address?” asked the Sandman.</p>
    <p>The Tinker shook his head.</p>
    <p>“That’s unlucky agin,” said the Sandman. “Ain’t there no sort o’ clue?”</p>
    <p>“None votiver, as I can perceive,” said the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Vy, zounds, then, ve’re jist vere ve started from,” cried the Sandman. “But it don’t matter.
     There’s not much chance o’ makin’ a bargin vith him. The crack o’ the skull I gave him has done
     his bus’ness.”</p>
    <p>“Nuffin’ o’ the kind,” replied the Tinker. “He alvays recovers from every kind of
     accident.”</p>
    <p>“Alvays recovers!” exclaimed the Sandman, in amazement. “Wot a constitootion he must
     have!”</p>
    <p>“Surprisin’!” replied the Tinker; “he never suffers from injuries—at least, not much; never
     grows old; and never expects to die; for he mentions wot he intends doin’ a hundred years
     hence.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, he’s a lu-nattic!” exclaimed the Sandman, “a downright lu-nattic; and that accounts for
     his wisitin’ that ’ere ruined house, and a-fancyin’ he heerd some one talk to him. He’s mad,
     depend upon it. That is, if I ain’t cured him.”</p>
    <p>“I’m of a different opinion,” said the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“And so am I,” said Mr. Ginger, who had approached unobserved, and overheard the greater part
     of their discourse.</p>
    <p>“Vy, vot can you know about it, Ginger?” said the Sandman, looking up, evidently rather
     annoyed.</p>
    <p>“I only know this,” replied Ginger, “that you’ve got a good case, and if you’ll let me into
     it, I’ll engage to make summat of it.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, I’m agreeable,” said the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“And so am I,” added the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Not that I pays much regard to wot you’ve bin a readin’ in his papers,” purused Ginger; “the
     gemman’s evidently half-cracked, if he ain’t cracked altogether—but he’s jist the person to
     work upon. He fancies hisself immortal—eh?”</p>
    <p>“Exactly so,” replied the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“And he also fancies he’s committed a lot o’ murders?” perused Ginger.</p>
    <p>“A desperate lot,” replied the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Then he’ll be glad to buy those papers at any price,” said Ginger. “Ve’ll deal vith him in
     regard to the pocket-book, as I deals vith regard to a dog—ask a price for its
     restitootion.”</p>
    <p>“We must find him out first,” said the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“There’s no difficulty in that,” rejoined Ginger. “You must be constantly on the look-out.
     You’re sure to meet him some time or other.”</p>
    <p>“That’s true,” replied the Sandman; “and there’s no fear of his knowin’ us, for the werry
     moment he looked round I knocked him on the head.”</p>
    <p>“Arter all,” said the Tinker, “there’s no branch o’ the perfession so safe as yours, Ginger.
     The law is favourable to you, and the beaks is afeerd to touch you. I think I shall turn
     dog-fancier myself.”</p>
    <p>“It’s a good business,” replied Ginger, “but it requires a hedication. As I wos sayin’, we
     gets a high price sometimes for restorin’ a favourite, especially ven ve’ve a soft-hearted lady
     to deal vith. There’s some vimen as fond o’ dogs as o’ their own childer, and ven ve gets one
     o’ their precious pets, ve makes ’em ransom it as the brigands you see at the Adelphi or the
     Surrey sarves their prisoners, threatenin’ to send first an ear, and then a paw, or a tail, and
     so on. I’ll tell you wot happened t’other day. There wos a lady—a Miss Vite—as was desperate
     fond of her dog. It wos a ugly warmint, but no matter for that—the creater had gained her
     heart. Vell, she lost it; and, somehow or other, I found it. She vos in great trouble, and a
     friend o’ mine calls to say she can have the dog agin, but she must pay eight pound for it. She
     thinks this dear, and a friend o’ her own adwises her to wait, sayin’ better terms will be
     offered; so I sends vord by my friend that if she don’t come down at once the poor animal’s
     throat vill be cut that werry night.”</p>
    <p>“Ha!—ha!—ha!” laughed the others.</p>
    <p>“Vell, she sent four pound, and I put up with it,” pursued Ginger; “but about a month
     arterwards she loses her favourite agin, and, strange to say, I finds it. The same game is
     played over agin, and she comes down with another four pound. But she takes care this time that
     I shan’t repeat the trick; for no sooner does she obtain persession of her favourite than she
     embarks in the steamer for France, in the hope of keeping her dog safe there.”</p>
    <p>“Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortinate Miss Bailey!—Fol-de-riddle-tol-ol-lol—unfortinate Miss Bailey!”
     sang the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“But there’s dog-fanciers in France, ain’t there?” asked the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Lor’ bless ‘ee, yes,” replied Ginger; “there’s as many fanciers i’ France as here. Vy, ve
     drives a smartish trade wi’ them through them foreign steamers. There’s scarcely a steamer as
     leaves the port o’ London but takes out a cargo o’ dogs. Ve sells ’em to the stewards, stokers,
     and sailors—cheap—and no questins asked. They goes to Ostend, Antverp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and
     sometimes to Havre. There’s a Mounseer Coqquilu as comes over to buy dogs, and ve takes ’em to
     him at a house near Billinsgit market.”</p>
    <p>“Then you’re alvays sure o’ a ready market somehow,” observed the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Sartin,” replied Ginger, “cos the law’s so kind to us. Vy, bless you, a perliceman can’t
     detain us, even if he knows ve’ve a stolen dog in our persession, and ve svears it’s our own;
     and yet he’d stop you in a minnit if he seed you with a suspicious-lookin’ bundle under your
     arm. Now, jist to show you the difference atwixt the two perfessions:—I steals a dog—walue,
     maybe, fifty pound, or p’raps more. Even if I’m catched i’ the fact I may get fined twenty
     pound, or have six months’ imprisonment; vile, if you steals an old fogle, walue three fardens,
     you’ll get seven years abroad, to a dead certainty.”</p>
    <p>“That seems hard on us,” observed the Sandman reflectively.</p>
    <p>“It’s the <hi>law</hi>!” exclaimed Ginger triumphantly. “Now, ve generally escapes by payin’
     the fine, ‘cos our pals goes and steals more dogs to raise the money. Ve alvays stands by each
     other. There’s a reg’lar horganisation among us; so ve can alvays bring vitnesses to svear vot
     ve likes, and ve so puzzles the beaks, that the case gets dismissed, and the constable says,
     ‘Vich party shall I give the dog to, your vorship?’ Upon vich, the beak replies, a-shakin’ of
     his vise noddle, ‘Give it to the person in whose persession it was found. I have nuffin’ more
     to do vith it.’ In course the dog is delivered up to us.”</p>
    <p>“The law seems made for dog-fanciers,” remarked the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Wot d’ye think o’ this?” pursued Ginger. “I wos a-standin’ at the corner o’ Gray’s Inn Lane
     vith some o’ my pals near a coach-stand, ven a lady passes by vith this here dog—an’ a beauty
     it is, a real long-eared Charley—a follerin’ of her. Vell, the moment I spies it, I unties my
     apron, whips up the dog, and covers it up in a trice. Vell, the lady sees me, an’ gives me in
     charge to a perliceman. But that si’nifies nuffin’. I brings six vitnesses to svear the dog vos
     mine, and I actually had it since it vos a blind little puppy; and, wot’s more, I brings its
      <hi>mother</hi>, and that settles the pint. So in course I’m discharged; the dog is given up
     to me; and the lady goes avay lamentin’. I then plays the amiable, an’ offers to sell it her
     for twenty guineas, seein’ as how she had taken a fancy to it; but she von’t bite. So if I
     don’t sell it next week, I shall send it to Mounseer Coqquilu. The only vay you can go wrong is
     to steal a dog wi’ a collar on, for if you do, you may get seven years’ transportation for a
     bit o’ leather and a brass plate vorth a shillin’, vile the animal, though vorth a hundred
     pound, can’t hurt you. There’s <hi>law</hi> again—ha, ha!”</p>
    <p>“Dog-fancier’s law!” laughed the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Some of the Fancy is given to cruelty,” pursued Ginger, “and crops a dog’s ears, or pulls
     out his teeth to disguise him; but I’m too fond o’ the animal for that. I may frighten old
     ladies sometimes, as I told you afore, but I never seriously hurts their pets. Nor did I ever
     kill a dog for his skin, as some on ’em does.”</p>
    <p>“And you’re always sure o’ gettin’ a dog, if you vants it, I s’pose?” inquired the
     Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Alvays,” replied Ginger. “No man’s dog is safe. I don’t care how he’s kept, ve’re sure to
     have him at last. Ve feels our vay with the sarvents, and finds out from them the walley the
     master or missis sets on the dog, and soon after that the animal’s gone. Vith a bit o’ liver,
     prepared in my partic’lar vay, I can tame the fiercest dog as ever barked, take him off his
     chain, an’ bring him arter me at a gallop.”</p>
    <p>“And do respectable parties ever buy dogs knowin’ they’re stolen?” inquired the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Ay, to be sure,” replied Ginger; “sometimes first-rate nobs. They put us up to it
     themselves; they’ll say, ‘I’ve jist left my Lord So-and-So’s, and there I seed a couple o’ the
     finest pointers I ever clapped eyes on. I vant you to get me <hi>jist sich another
     couple</hi>.’ Vell, ve understands in a minnit, an’ in doo time the identicle dogs finds their
     vay to our customer.”</p>
    <p>“Oh! that’s how it’s done?” remarked the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Yes, that’s the vay,” replied Ginger. “Sometimes a party’ll vant a couple o’ dogs for the
     shootin’ season; and then ve asks, ‘Vich vay are you a-goin’—into Surrey or Kent?’ And
     accordin’ as the answer is given ve arranges our plans.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, yourn appears a profitable and safe employment, I must say,” remarked the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Perfectly so,” replied Ginger. “Nothin’ can touch us till dogs is declared by statute to be
     property, and stealin’ ’em a misdemeanour. And that won’t occur in my time.”</p>
    <p>“Let’s hope not,” rejoined the other two.</p>
    <p>“To come back to the pint from vich we started,” said the Tinker; “our gemman’s case is not
     so surprisin’ as it at first appears. There are some persons as believe they never will die—and
     I myself am of the same opinion. There’s our old deputy here—him as ve calls Old Parr—vy, he
     declares he lived in Queen Bess’s time, recollects King Charles bein’ beheaded perfectly vell,
     and remembers the Great Fire o’ London, as if it only occurred yesterday.”</p>
    <p>“Walker!” exclaimed Ginger, putting his finger to his nose.</p>
    <p>“You may larf, but it’s true,” replied the Tinker. “I recollect an old man tellin’ me that he
     knew the deputy sixty years ago, and he looked jist the same then as now,—neither older nor
     younger.”</p>
    <p>“Humph!” exclaimed Ginger. “He don’t look so old now.”</p>
    <p>“That’s the cur’ousest part of it,” said the Tinker. “He don’t like to talk of his age unless
     you can get him i’ the humour; but he once told me he didn’t know why he lived so long, unless
     it were owin’ to a potion he’d swallowed, vich his master, who was a great conjurer in Queen
     Bess’s days, had brew’d.”</p>
    <p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Ginger. “I thought you too knowin’ a cove, Tinker, to be gulled by such an
     old vife’s story as that.”</p>
    <p>“Let’s have the old fellow in and talk to him,” replied the Tinker. “Here, lazy-bones,” he
     added, rousing the sleeping youth, “go an’ tell Old Parr ve vants his company over a glass o’
     rum-an’-vater.”</p>

    <head>The Hand and the Cloak</head>
    <p>A furious barking from Mr. Ginger’s dogs, shortly after the departure of the drowsy youth,
     announced the approach of a grotesque-looking little personage, whose shoulders barely reached
     to a level with the top of the table. This was Old Parr. The dwarfs head was much too large for
     his body, as is mostly the case with undersized persons, and was covered with a forest of rusty
     black hair, protected by a strangely shaped seal-skin cap. His hands and feet were equally
     disproportioned to his frame, and his arms were so long that he could touch his ankles while
     standing upright. His spine was crookened, and his head appeared buried in his breast. The
     general character of his face seemed to appertain to the middle period of life; but a closer
     inspection enabled the beholder to detect in it marks of extreme old age. The nose was broad
     and flat, like that of an ourang-outang; the resemblance to which animal was heightened by a
     very long upper lip, projecting jaws, almost total absence of chin, and a retreating forehead.
     The little old man’s complexion was dull and swarthy, but his eyes were keen and sparkling.</p>
    <p>His attire was as singular as his person. Having recently served as double to a famous
     demon-dwarf at the Surrey Theatre, he had become possessed of a cast-off pair of tawny tights,
     an elastic shirt of the same material and complexion, to the arms of which little green
     bat-like wings were attached, while a blood-red tunic with vandyke points was girded round his
     waist. In this strange apparel his diminutive limbs were encased, while additional warmth was
     afforded by the greatcoat already mentioned, the tails of which swept the floor after him like
     a train.</p>
    <p>Having silenced his dogs with some difficulty, Mr. Ginger burst into a roar of laughter,
     excited by the little old man’s grotesque appearance, in which he was joined by the Tinker; but
     the Sandman never relaxed a muscle of his sullen countenance.</p>
    <p>Their hilarity, however, was suddenly checked by an inquiry from the dwarf, in a shrill, odd
     tone, “Whether they had sent for him only to laugh at him?”</p>
    <p>“Sartainly not, deputy,” replied the Tinker. “Here, lazy-bones, glasses o’ rum-an’-vater, all
     round.”</p>
    <p>The drowsy youth bestirred himself to execute the command. The spirit was brought; water was
     procured from the boiling copper; and the Tinker handed his guest a smoking rummer, accompanied
     with a polite request to make himself comfortable.</p>
    <p>Opposite the table at which the party were seated, it has been said, was a staircase—old and
     crazy, and but imperfectly protected by a broken hand-rail. Midway up it stood a door equally
     dilapidated, but secured by a chain and lock, of which Old Parr, as deputy-chamberlain, kept
     the key. Beyond this point the staircase branched off on the right, and a row of stout wooden
     banisters, ranged like the feet of so many cattle, was visible from beneath. Ultimately, the
     staircase reached a small gallery, if such a name can be applied to a narrow passage
     communicating with the bedrooms, the doors of which, as a matter of needful precaution, were
     locked outside; and as the windows were grated, no one could leave his chamber without the
     knowledge of the landlord or his representative. No lights were allowed in the bedrooms, nor in
     the passage adjoining them.</p>
    <p>Conciliated by the Tinker’s offering, Old Parr mounted the staircase, and planting himself
     near the door, took off his greatcoat, and sat down upon it. His impish garb being thus more
     fully displayed, he looked so unearthly and extraordinary that the dogs began to howl
     fearfully, and Ginger had enough to do to quiet them.</p>
    <p>Silence being at length restored, the Tinker, winking slyly at his companions, opened the
     conversation.</p>
    <p>“I say, deputy,” he observed, “ve’ve bin havin’ a bit o’ a dispute vich you can settle for
     us.”</p>
    <p>“Well, let’s see,” squeaked the dwarf. “What is it?”</p>
    <p>“Vy, it’s relative to your age,” rejoined the Tinker. “Ven wos you born?”</p>
    <p>“It’s so long ago, I can’t recollect,” returned Old Parr rather sulkily.</p>
    <p>“You must ha’ seen some changes in your time?” resumed the Tinker, waiting till the little
     old man had made some progress with his grog.</p>
    <p>“I rayther think I have—a few,” replied Old Parr, whose tongue the generous liquid had
     loosened. “I’ve seen this great city of London pulled down, and built up again—if that’s
     anything. I’ve seen it grow, and grow, till it has reached its present size. You’ll scarcely
     believe me, when I tell you, that I recollect this Rookery of ours—this foul vagabond
     neighbourhood—an open country field, with hedges round it, and trees. And a lovely spot it was.
     Broad Saint Giles’s, at the time I speak of, was a little country village, consisting of a few
     straggling houses standing by the roadside, and there wasn’t a single habitation between it and
     Convent Garden (for so the present market was once called); while that garden, which was fenced
     round with pales, like a park, extended from Saint Martin’s Lane to Drury House, a great
     mansion situated on the easterly side of Drury Lane, amid a grove of beautiful timber.”</p>
    <p>“My eyes!” cried Ginger, with a prolonged whistle; “the place must be preciously
     transmogrified indeed!”</p>
    <p>“If I were to describe the changes that have taken place in London since I’ve known it, I
     might go on talking for a month,” pursued Old Parr. “The whole aspect of the place is altered.
     The Thames itself is unlike the Thames of old. Its waters were once as clear and bright above
     London Bridge as they are now at Kew or Richmond; and its banks, from Whitefriars to Scotland
     Yard, were edged with gardens. And then the thousand gay wherries and gilded barges that
     covered its bosom—all are gone—all are gone!”</p>
    <p>“Those must ha’ been nice times for the jolly young vatermen vich at Black friars wos used
     for to ply,” chanted the Tinker; “but the steamers has put their noses out o’ joint.”</p>
    <p>“True,” replied Old Parr; “and I, for one, am sorry for it. Remembering, as I do, what the
     river used to be when enlightened by gay craft and merry company, I can’t help wishing its
     waters less muddy, and those ugly coal-barges, lighters, and steamers away. London is a mighty
     city, wonderful to behold and examine, inexhaustible in its wealth and power; but in point of
     beauty it is not to be compared with the city of Queen Bess’s days. You should have seen the
     Strand then—a line of noblemen’s houses—and as to Lombard Street and Gracechurch Street, with
     their wealthy goldsmiths’ shops—but I don’t like to think of ’em.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, I’m content vith Lunnun as it is,” replied the Tinker, “‘specially as there ain’t much
     chance o’ the ould city bein’ rewived.”</p>
    <p>“Not much,” replied the dwarf, finishing his glass, which was replenished at a sign from the
     Tinker.</p>
    <p>“I s’pose, my wenerable, you’ve seen the king as bequeathed his name to these pretty
     creaters,” said Ginger, raising his coat-pockets, so as to exhibit the heads of the two little
     black-and-tan spaniels.</p>
    <p>“What! old Rowley?” cried the dwarf—“often. I was page to his favourite mistress, the Duchess
     of Cleveland, and I have seen him a hundred times with a pack of dogs of that description at
     his heels.”</p>
    <p>“Old Rowley wos a king arter my own ‘art,” said Ginger, rising and lighting a pipe at the
     fire. “He loved the femi-<hi>nine</hi> specious as well as the ca-<hi>nine</hi> specious. Can
     you tell us anythin’ more about him?”</p>
    <p>“Not now,” replied Old Parr. “I’ve seen so much, and heard so much, that my brain is quite
     addled. My memory sometimes deserts me altogether, and my past life appears like a dream.
     Imagine what my feelings must be, to walk through streets, still called by the old names, but
     in other respects wholly changed. Oh! if you could but have a glimpse of Old London, you would
     not be able to endure the modern city. The very atmosphere was different from that which we now
     breathe, charged with the smoke of myriads of sea-coal fires; and the old picturesque houses
     had a charm about them, which the present habitations, however commodious, altogether
     want.”</p>
    <p>“You talk like one o’ them smart chaps they calls, and werry properly, penny-a-liars,”
     observed Ginger. “But you make me long to ha’ lived i’ those times.”</p>
    <p>“If you <hi>had</hi> lived in them, you would have belonged to Paris Garden, or the
     bull-baiting and bear-baiting houses in Southwark,” replied Old Parr. “I’ve seen fellows just
     like you at each of those places. Strange, though times and fashions change, men continue the
     same. I often meet a face that I can remember in James the First’s time. But the old places are
     gone—clean gone!”</p>
    <p>“Accordin’ to your own showin’, my wenerable friend, you must ha’ lived uppards o’ two
     hundred and seventy year,” said Ginger, assuming a consequential manner. “Now, doorin’ all that
     time, have you never felt inclined to kick the bucket?”</p>
    <p>“Not the least,” replied Old Parr. “My bodily health has been excellent. But, as I have just
     said, my intellects are a little impaired.”</p>
    <p>“Not a little, I should think,” replied Ginger, hemming significantly. “I don’t know vether
     you’re a deceivin’ of us or yourself, my wenerable; but von thing’s quite clear—you
      <hi>can’t</hi> have lived all that time. It’s not in nater.”</p>
    <p>“Very well, then—I haven’t,” said Old Parr.</p>
    <p>And he finished his rum-and-water, and set down the glass, which was instantly filled again
     by the drowsy youth.</p>
    <p>“You’ve seen some picters o’ Old Lunnon, and they’ve haanted you in your dreams, till you’ve
     begun to fancy you lived in those times,” said Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Very likely,” replied Old Parr—“very likely.”</p>
    <p>There was something, however, in his manner calculated to pique the dog-fancier’s
     curiosity.</p>
    <p>“How comes it,” he said, stretching out his legs, and arranging his neckcloth,—“how comes it,
     if you’ve lived so long, that you ain’t higher up in the stirrups—better off, as folks
     say?”</p>
    <p>The dwarf made no reply, but covering his face with his hands, seemed a prey to deep emotion.
     After a few moments’ pause, Ginger repeated the question.</p>
    <p>“If you won’t believe what I tell you, it’s useless to give an answer,” said Old Parr,
     somewhat gruffly.</p>
    <p>“Oh yes, <hi>I</hi> believe you, deputy,” observed the Tinker, “and so does the Sandman.”</p>
    <p>“Well, then,” replied the dwarf, “I’ll tell you how it comes to pass. Fate has been against
     me. I’ve had plenty of chances, but I never could get on. I’ve been in a hundred different
     walks of life, but they always led down hill. It’s my destiny.”</p>
    <p>“That’s hard,” rejoined the Tinker—“werry hard. But how d’ye account for livin’ so long?” he
     added, winking as he spoke to the others.</p>
    <p>“I’ve already given you an explanation,” replied the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“Av, but it’s a cur’ous story, and I vants my friends to hear it,” said the Tinker, in a
     coaxing tone.</p>
    <p>“Well then, to oblige you, I’ll go through it again,” rejoined the dwarf. “You must know I
     was for some time servant to Doctor Lamb, an old alchemist, who lived during the reign of good
     Queen Bess, and who used to pass all his time in trying to find out the secret of changing lead
     and copper into gold.”</p>
    <p>“I’ve known several indiwiduals as has found out that secret, wenerable,” observed Ginger.
     “And ve calls ’em smashers, nowadays—not halchemists.”</p>
    <p>“Doctor Lamb’s object was actually to turn base metal into gold,” rejoined Old Parr, in a
     tone of slight contempt. “But his chief aim was to produce the elixir of long life. Night and
     day he worked at the operation;—night and day I laboured with him, until at last we were both
     brought to the verge of the grave in our search after immortality. One night—I remember it
     well,—it was the last night of the sixteenth century,—a young man, severely wounded, was
     brought to my master’s dwelling on London Bridge. I helped to convey him to the laboratory,
     where I left him with the doctor, who was busy with his experiments. My curiosity being
     aroused, I listened at the door, and though I could not distinguish much that passed inside, I
     heard sufficient to convince me that Doctor Lamb had made the grand discovery, and succeeded in
     distilling the elixir. Having learnt this, I went down-stairs, wondering what would next ensue.
     Half-an-hour elapsed, and while the bells were ringing in the new year joyfully, the young man
     whom I had assisted to carry up-stairs, and whom I supposed at death’s door, marched down as
     firmly as if nothing had happened, passed by me, and disappeared, before I could shake off my
     astonishment. I saw at once he had drunk the elixir.”</p>
    <p>“Ah!—ah!” exclaimed the Tinker, with a knowing glance at his companions, who returned it with
     gestures of equal significance.</p>
    <p>“As soon as he was gone,” pursued the dwarf, “I flew to the laboratory, and there, extended
     on the floor, I found the dead body of Doctor Lamb. I debated with myself what to do—whether to
     pursue his murderer, for such I accounted the young man; but, on reflection, I thought the
     course useless. I next looked round to see whether the precious elixir was gone. On the table
     stood a phial, from which a strong spirituous odour exhaled; but it was empty. I then turned my
     attention to a receiver, connected by a worm with an alembic on the furnace. On examining it, I
     found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent liquid, which, poured forth into a
     glass, emitted precisely the same odour as the phial. Persuaded this must be the draught of
     immortality, I raised it to my lips; but apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand.
     Reassured, however, by the thought of the young man’s miraculous recovery, I quaffed the
     potion. It was as if I had swallowed fire, and at first I thought all was over with me. I
     shrieked out; but there was no one to heed my cries, unless it were my dead master, and two or
     three skeletons with which the walls were garnished. And these, in truth, did seem to hear me;
     for the dead corpse opened its glassy orbs, and eyed me reproachfully; the skeletons shook
     their fleshless arms and gibbered; and the various strange objects, with which the chamber was
     filled, seemed to deride and menace me. The terror occasioned by these fantasies, combined with
     the potency of the draught, took away my senses. When I recovered, I found all tranquil. Doctor
     Lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet, with an expression of reproach on his fixed
     countenance; and the skeletons were hanging quietly in their places. Convinced that I was proof
     against death, I went forth. <hi>But a curse went with me!</hi> From that day to this I have
     lived, but it has been in such poverty and distress, that I had better far have died. Besides,
     I am constantly haunted by visions of my old master. He seems to hold converse with me—to lead
     me into strange places.”</p>
    <p>“Exactly the case with the t’other,” whispered the Tinker to the Sandman. “Have you ever, in
     the coorse o’ your long life, met the young man as drank the ‘lixir?” he inquired of the
     dwarf.</p>
    <p>“Never.”</p>
    <p>“Do you happen to rekilect his name?”</p>
    <p>“No; it has quite escaped my memory,” answered Old Parr.</p>
    <p>“Should you rekilect it, if you heerd it?” asked the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Perhaps I might,” returned the dwarf; “but I can’t say.”</p>
    <p>“Wos it Auriol Darcy?” demanded the other.</p>
    <p>“That <hi>was</hi> the name,” cried Old Parr, starting up in extreme surprise. “I heard
     Doctor Lamb call him so. But how, in the name of wonder, do you come to know it?”</p>
    <p>“Ve’ve got summat, at last,” said the Tinker, with a self-applauding glance at his
     friends.</p>
    <p>“How do you come to know it, I say?” repeated the dwarf, in extreme agitation.</p>
    <p>“Never mind,” rejoined the Tinker, with a cunning look; “you see I does know some cur’ous
     matters as veil as you, my old file. Yo’ll be good evidence, in case ve vishes to prove the
     fact agin him.”</p>
    <p>“Prove what?—and against whom?” cried the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“One more questin, and I’ve done,” pursued the Tinker. “Should you know this young man agin,
     in case you chanced to come across him?”</p>
    <p>“No doubt of it,” replied Old Parr; “his figure often flits before me in dreams.”</p>
    <p>“Shall ve let him into it?” said the Tinker, consulting his companions in a low tone.</p>
    <p>“Ay—ay,” replied the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Better vait a bit,” remarked Ginger, shaking his head dubiously. “There’s no hurry.”</p>
    <p>“No; ve must decide at vonce,” said the Tinker. “Jist examine them papers,” he added, handing
     the pocket-book to Old Parr, “and favour us vith your opinion on ’em.”</p>
    <p>The dwarf was about to unclasp the book committed to his charge, when a hand was suddenly
     thrust through the banisters of the upper part of the staircase, which, as has been already
     stated, was divided from the lower by the door. A piece of heavy black drapery next descended
     like a cloud, concealing all behind it except the hand, with which the dwarf was suddenly
     seized by the nape of the neck, lifted up in the air, and, notwithstanding his shrieks and
     struggles, carried clean off.</p>
    <p>Great confusion attended his disappearance. The dogs set up a prodigious barking, and flew to
     the rescue—one of the largest of them passing over the body of the drowsy waiter, who had
     sought his customary couch upon the coals, and rousing him from his slumbers; while the Tinker,
     uttering a fierce imprecation, upset his chair in his haste to catch hold of the dwarf’s legs;
     but the latter was already out of reach, and the next moment had vanished entirely.</p>
    <p>“My eyes! here’s a pretty go!” cried Ginger, who, with his back to the fire, had witnessed
     the occurrence in open-mouthed astonishment. “Vy, curse it! if the wenerable ain’t a-taken the
     pocket-book with him! It’s my opinion the devil has flown avay with the old feller. His time
     wos nearer at ‘and than he expected.”</p>
    <p>“Devil or not, I’ll have him back agin, or at all events the pocket-book!” cried the Tinker.
     And, dashing up the stairs, he caught hold of the railing above, and swinging himself up by a
     powerful effort, passed through an opening, occasioned by the removal of one of the
     banisters.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>Groping along the gallery, which was buried in profound darkness, he shouted to the dwarf,
     but received no answer to his vociferations; neither could he discover any one, though he felt
     on either side of the passage with outstretched hands. The occupants of the different chambers,
     alarmed by the noise, called out to know what was going forward; but being locked in their
     rooms, they could render no assistance.</p>
    <p>While the Tinker was thus pursuing his search in the dark, venting his rage and
     disappointment in the most dreadful imprecations, the staircase door was opened by the
     landlord, who had found the key in the greatcoat left behind by the dwarf. With the landlord
     came the Sandman and Ginger, the latter of whom was attended by all his dogs, still barking
     furiously; while the rear of the party was brought up by the drowsy waiter, now wide awake with
     fright, and carrying a candle.</p>
    <p>But though every nook and corner of the place was visited—though the attics were searched,
     and all the windows examined—not a trace of the dwarf could be discovered, nor any clue to his
     mysterious disappearance detected. Astonishment and alarm sat on every countenance.</p>
    <p>“What the devil can have become of him?” cried the landlord, with a look of dismay.</p>
    <p>“Ay, that’s the questin!” rejoined the Tinker. “I begin to be of Ginger’s opinion, that the
     devil himself must have flown avay vith him. No von else could ha’ taken a fancy to him.”</p>
    <p>“I only saw a hand and a black cloak,” said the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“I thought I seed a pair o’ hoofs,” cried the waiter; “and I’m quite sure I seed a pair o’
     great glitterin’ eyes,” he added, opening his own lacklustre orbs to their widest extent.</p>
    <p>“It’s a strange affair,” observed the landlord gravely. “It’s certain that no one has entered
     the house wearing a cloak such as you describe; nor could any of the lodgers, to my knowledge,
     get out of their rooms. It was Old Parr’s business, as you know, to lock ’em up carefully for
     the night.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, all’s over vith him now,” said the Tinker; “and vith our affair, too, I’m afeerd.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t say die jist yet,” rejoined Ginger. “The wenerable’s gone, to be sure; and the only
     thing he has left behind him, barrin’ his topcoat, is this here bit o’ paper vich dropped out
     o’ the pocket-book as he wos a-takin’ flight, and vich I picked from the floor. It may be o’
     some use to us. But come, let’s go down-stairs. There’s no good in stayin’ here any
     longer.”</p>
    <p>Concurring in which sentiment, they all descended to the lower room.</p>

    <head>The Iron-merchant’s Daughter</head>
    <p>A week had elapsed since Auriol Darcy was conveyed to the iron-merchant’s dwelling, after the
     attack made upon him by the ruffians in the ruined house; and though almost recovered from the
     serious injuries he had received, he still remained the guest of his preserver.</p>
    <p>It was a bright spring morning, when a door leading to the yard in front of the house opened,
     and a young girl, bright and fresh as the morning’s self, issued from it.</p>
    <p>A lovelier creature than Ebba Thorneycroft cannot be imagined. Her figure was
     perfection—slight, tall, and ravishingly proportioned, with a slender waist, little limbs, and
     fairy feet that would have made the fortune of an opera-dancer. Her features were almost
     angelic in expression, with an outline of the utmost delicacy and precision—not cold, classical
     regularity—but that softer and incomparably more lovely mould peculiar to our own clime. Ebba’s
     countenance was a type of Saxon beauty. Her complexion was pure white, tinged with a slight
     bloom. Her eyes were of a serene summer blue, arched over by brows some shades darker than the
     radiant tresses that fell on either cheek, and were parted over a brow smoother than alabaster.
     Her attire was simple but tasteful, and by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding
     fairness of her skin.</p>
    <p>Ebba’s first care was to feed her favourite linnet, placed in a cage over the door. Having
     next patted the head of a huge bulldog who came out of his kennel to greet her, and exchanged a
     few words with two men employed at a forge in the inner part of the building on the right, she
     advanced farther into the yard.</p>
    <p>This part of the premises, being strewn with ironwork of every possible shape, presented a
     very singular appearance, and may merit some description. There were heaps of rusty iron chains
     flung together like fishermen’s nets, old iron area-guards, iron kitchen-fenders, old grates,
     safes, piles of old iron bowls, a large assortment of old iron pans and dishes, a ditto of old
     ovens, kettles without number, sledge-hammers, anvils, braziers, chimney-cowls, and
     smoke-jacks.</p>
    <p>Stout upright posts, supporting cross-beams on the top, were placed at intervals on either
     side of the yard, and these were decorated, in the most artistic style, with rat-traps,
     man-traps, iron lanterns, pulleys, padlocks, chains, trivets, triangles, iron rods, disused
     street lamps, dismounted cannon, and anchors. Attached to hooks in the cross-beam nearest the
     house hung a row of old horse-shoes, while from the centre depended a large rusty bell. Near
     the dog’s kennel was a tool-box, likewise garnished with horse-shoes, and containing pincers,
     files, hammers, and other implements proper to the smith. Beyond this was an open doorway
     leading to the workshop, where the two men before mentioned were busy at the forge.</p>
    <p>Though it was still early, the road was astir with passengers; and many waggons and carts,
     laden with hay, straw, and vegetables, were passing. Ebba, however, had been solely drawn forth
     by the beauty of the morning, and she stopped for a moment at the street gate, to breathe the
     balmy air. As she inhaled the gentle breeze, and felt the warm sunshine upon her cheek, her
     thoughts wandered away into the green meadows in which she had strayed as a child, and she
     longed to ramble amid them again. Perhaps she scarcely desired a solitary stroll; but however
     this might be, she was too much engrossed by the reverie to notice a tall man, wrapped in a
     long black cloak, who regarded her with the most fixed attention, as he passed on the opposite
     side of the road.</p>
    <p>Proceeding to a short distance, this personage crossed over, and returned slowly towards the
     iron-merchant’s dwelling. Ebba then, for the first time, remarked him, and was startled by his
     strange, sinister appearance. His features were handsome, but so malignant and fierce in
     expression, that they inspired only aversion. A sardonic grin curled his thin lips, and his
     short, crisply curled hair, raven-black in hue, contrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his
     cadaverous complexion. An attraction like that of the snake seemed to reside in his dark
     blazing eyes, for Ebba trembled like a bird beneath their influence, and could not remove her
     gaze from them. A vague presentiment of coming ill smote her, and she dreaded lest the
     mysterious being before her might be connected in some inexplicable way with her future
     destiny.</p>
    <p>On his part, the stranger was not insensible to the impression he had produced, and suddenly
     halting, he kept his eyes riveted on those of the girl, who, after remaining spell-bound, as it
     were, for a few moments, precipitately retreated towards the house.</p>
    <p>Just as she reached the door, and was about to pass through it, Auriol came forth. He was
     pale, as if from recent suffering, and bore his left arm in a sling.</p>
    <p>“You look agitated,” he said, noticing Ebba’s uneasiness. “What has happened?”</p>
    <p>“Not much,” she replied, a deep blush mantling her cheeks. “But I have been somewhat alarmed
     by the person near the gate.”</p>
    <p>“Indeed!” cried Auriol, darting forward. “Where is he? I see no one.”</p>
    <p>“Not a tall man, wrapped in a long black cloak?” rejoined Ebba, following him cautiously.</p>
    <p>“Ha!” cried Auriol. “Has he been here?”</p>
    <p>“Then you know the person I allude to?” she rejoined.</p>
    <p>“I know some one answering his description,” he replied, with a forced smile.</p>
    <p>“Once beheld, the man I mean is not to be forgotten,” said Ebba. “He has a countenance such
     as I never saw before. If I could believe in the ‘evil eye,’ I should be sure he possessed
     it.”</p>
    <p>“’Tis he, there can be no doubt,” rejoined Auriol, in a sombre tone.</p>
    <p>“Who and what is he, then?” demanded Ebba.</p>
    <p>“He is a messenger of ill,” replied Auriol, “and I am thankful he is gone.”</p>

    <p>“Are you quite sure of it?” she asked, glancing timorously up and down the road. But the
     mysterious individual could no longer be seen.</p>
    <p>“And so, after exciting my curiosity in this manner, you will not satisfy it?” she said.</p>
    <p>“I cannot,” rejoined Auriol, somewhat sternly.</p>
    <p>“Nay, then, since you are so ungracious, I shall go and prepare breakfast,” she replied. “My
     father must be down by this time.”</p>
    <p>“Stay!” cried Auriol, arresting her, as she was about to pass through the door. “I wish to
     have a word with you.”</p>
    <p>Ebba stopped, and the bloom suddenly forsook her cheeks.</p>
    <p>But Auriol seemed unable to proceed. Neither dared to regard the other; and a profound
     silence prevailed between them for a few moments.</p>
    <p>“Ebba,” said Auriol at length, “I am about to leave your father’s house to-day.”</p>
    <p>“Why so soon?” she exclaimed, looking up into his face. “You are not entirely recovered
     yet.”</p>
    <p>“I dare not stay longer,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Dare not!” cried Ebba. And she again cast down her eyes; but Auriol made no reply.</p>
    <p>Fortunately the silence was broken by the clinking of the smiths’ hammers upon the anvil.</p>
    <p>“If you must really go,” said Ebba, looking up, after a long pause, “I hope we shall see you
     again?”</p>
    <p>“Most assuredly,” replied Auriol. “I owe your worthy father a deep debt of gratitude—a debt
     which, I fear, I shall never be able to repay.”</p>
    <p>“My father is more than repaid in saving your life,” she replied. “I am sure he will be sorry
     to learn you are going so soon.”</p>
    <p>“I have been here a week,” said Auriol. “If I remained longer, I might not be able to go at
     all.”</p>
    <p>There was another pause, during which a stout old fellow in the workshop quitted the anvil
     for a moment, and, catching a glimpse of the young couple, muttered to his helpmate—</p>
    <p>“I say, Ned, I’m a-thinkin’ our master’ll soon have a son-in-law. There’s pretty plain signs
     on it at yonder door.”</p>
    <p>“So there be, John,” replied Ned, peeping round. “He’s a good-lookin’ young feller that. I
     wish ve could hear their discoorse.”</p>
    <p>“No, that ain’t fair,” replied John, raking some small coal upon the fire, and working away
     at the bellows.</p>
    <p>“I would not for the world ask a disagreeable question,” said Ebba, again raising her eyes,
     “but since you are about to quit us, I must confess I should like to know something of your
     history.”</p>
    <p>“Forgive me if I decline to comply with your desire,” replied Auriol. “You would not believe
     me, were I to relate my history. But this I may say, that it is stranger and wilder than any
     you ever heard. The prisoner in his cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than those
     which bind me to silence.”</p>
    <p>Ebba gazed at him as if she feared his reasoning were wandering.</p>
    <p>“You think me mad,” said Auriol; “would I were so! But I shall never lose the clear
     perception of my woes. Hear me, Ebba! Fate has brought me into this house. I have seen you, and
     experienced your gentle ministry; and it is impossible, so circumstanced, to be blind to your
     attractions. I have only been too sensible to them—but I will not dwell on that theme, nor run
     the risk of exciting a passion which must destroy you. I will ask you to hate me—to regard me
     as a monster whom you ought to shun rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the
     slightest sympathy.”</p>
    <p>“You have some motive in saying this to me,” cried the terrified girl.</p>
    <p>“My motive is to warn you,” said Auriol. “If you love me, you are lost—utterly lost!”</p>
    <p>She was so startled, that she could make no reply, but burst into tears. Auriol took her
     hand, which she unresistingly yielded.</p>
    <p>“A terrible fatality attaches to me, in which you must have no share,” he said, in a solemn
     tone.</p>
    <p>“Would you had never come to my father’s house!” she exclaimed, in a voice of anguish.</p>
    <p>“Is it, then, too late?” cried Auriol despairingly.</p>
    <p>“It is—if to love you be fatal,” she rejoined.</p>
    <p>“Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, striking his forehead with his clenched hand. “Recall your
     words—Ebba—recall them—but no, once uttered—it is impossible. You are bound to me for ever. I
     must fulfil my destiny.”</p>
    <p>At this juncture a low growl broke from the dog, and, guided by the sound, the youthful
     couple beheld, standing near the gate, the tall dark man in the black cloak. A fiendish smile
     sat upon his countenance.</p>
    <p>“That is the man who frightened me!” cried Ebba.</p>
    <p>“It is the person I supposed!” ejaculated Auriol. “I must speak to him. Leave me, Ebba. I
     will join you presently.”</p>
    <p>And as the girl, half sinking with apprehension, withdrew, he advanced quickly towards the
     intruder.</p>
    <p>“I have sought you for some days,” said the tall man, in a stern, commanding voice. “You have
     not kept your appointment with me.”</p>
    <p>“I could not,” replied Auriol—“an accident has befallen me.”</p>
    <p>“I know it,” rejoined the other. “I am aware you were assailed by ruffians in the ruined
     house over the way. But you are recovered now, and can go forth. You ought to have communicated
     with me.”</p>
    <p>“It was my intention to do so,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Our meeting cannot be delayed much longer,” pursued the stranger. “I will give you three
     more days. On the evening of the last day, at the hour of seven, I shall look for you at the
     foot of the statue in Hyde Park.”</p>
    <p>“I will be there,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“That girl must be the next victim,” said the stranger, with a grim smile.</p>
    <p>“Peace!” thundered Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Nay, I need not remind you of the tenure by which you maintain your power,” rejoined the
     stranger. “But I will not trouble you further now.”</p>
    <p>And, wrapping his cloak more closely round him, he disappeared.</p>
    <p>“Fate has once more involved me in its net,” cried Auriol bitterly. “But I will save Ebba,
     whatever it may cost me. I will see her no more.”</p>
    <p>And instead of returning to the house, he hurried away in the opposite direction of the
     stranger.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 5</head>
    <head>The Meeting near the Statue</head>
    <p>The evening of the third day arrived, and Auriol entered Hyde Park by Stanhope Gate. Glancing
     at his watch, and finding it wanted nearly three-quarters of an hour of the time appointed for
     his meeting with the mysterious stranger, he struck across the park, in the direction of the
     Serpentine River. Apparently he was now perfectly recovered, for his arm was without the
     support of the sling, and he walked with great swiftness. But his countenance was deathly pale,
     and his looks were so wild and disordered, that the few persons he encountered shrank from him
     aghast.</p>
    <p>A few minutes’ rapid walking brought him to the eastern extremity of the Serpentine, and
     advancing close to the edge of the embankment, he gazed at the waters beneath his feet.</p>
    <p>“I would plunge into them, if I could find repose,” he murmured. “But it would avail nothing.
     I should only add to my sufferings. No; I must continue to endure the weight of a life burdened
     by crime and remorse, till I can find out the means of freeing myself from it. Once I dreaded
     this unknown danger, but now I seek for it in vain.”</p>
    <p>The current of his thoughts was here interrupted by the sudden appearance of a dark object on
     the surface of the water, which he at first took to be a huge fish, with a pair of green fins
     springing from its back; but after watching it more closely for a few moments, he became
     convinced that it was a human being, tricked out in some masquerade attire, while the slight
     struggles which it made proved that life was not entirely extinct.</p>
    <p>Though, the moment before, he had contemplated self-destruction, and had only been restrained
     from the attempt by the certainty of failing in his purpose, instinct prompted him to rescue
     the perishing creature before him. Without hesitation, therefore, and without tarrying to
     divest himself of his clothes, he dashed into the water, and striking out, instantly reached
     the object of his quest, which still continued to float, and turning it over, for the face was
     downwards, he perceived it was an old man, of exceedingly small size, habited in a pantomimic
     garb. He also remarked that a rope was twisted round the neck of the unfortunate being, making
     it evident that some violent attempt had been made upon his life.</p>
    <p>Without pausing for further investigation, he took firm hold of the leathern wings of the
     dwarf, and with his disengaged hand propelled himself towards the shore, dragging the other
     after him. The next instant he reached the bank, clambered up the low brickwork, and placed his
     burden in safety.</p>
    <p>The noise of the plunge had attracted attention, and several persons now hurried to the spot.
     On coming up, and finding Auriol bending over a water-sprite—for such, at first sight, the
     dwarf appeared—they could not repress their astonishment. Wholly insensible to the presence of
     those around him, Auriol endeavoured to recall where he had seen the dwarf before. All at once,
     the recollection flashed upon him, and he cried aloud, “Why, it is my poor murdered
     grandfather’s attendant, Flapdragon! But no! no!—he must be dead ages ago! Yet the resemblance
     is singularly striking!”</p>
    <p>Auriol’s exclamations, coupled with his wild demeanour, surprised the bystanders, and they
     came to the conclusion that he must be a travelling showman, who had attempted to drown his
     dwarf—the grotesque, impish garb of the latter convincing them that he had been exhibited at a
     booth. They made signs, therefore, to each other not to let Auriol escape, and one of them,
     raising the dwarf’s head on his knee, produced a flask, and poured some brandy from it down his
     throat, while others chafed his hands. These efforts were attended with much speedier success
     than might have been anticipated. After a struggle or two for respiration, the dwarf opened his
     eyes, and gazed at the group around him.</p>
    <p>“It must be Flapdragon!” exclaimed Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Ah! who calls me?” cried the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“I!” rejoined Auriol. “Do you not recollect me?”</p>
    <p>“To be sure!” exclaimed the dwarf, gazing at him fixedly; “you are——” and he stopped.</p>
    <p>“You have been thrown into the water, Master Flapdragon?” cried a bystander, noticing the
     cord round the dwarf’s throat.</p>
    <p>“I have,” replied the little old man.</p>
    <p>“By your governor—that is, by this person?” cried another, laying hold of Auriol.</p>
    <p>“By him—no,” said the dwarf; “I have not seen that gentleman for nearly three centuries.”</p>
    <p>“Three centuries, my little patriarch?” said the man who had given him the brandy. “That’s a
     long time. Think again.”</p>
    <p>“It’s perfectly true, nevertheless,” replied the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“His wits have been washed away by the water,” said the first speaker. “Give him a drop more
     brandy.”</p>
    <p>“Not a bit of it,” rejoined the dwarf; “my senses were never clearer than at this moment. At
     last we have met,” he continued, addressing Auriol, “and I hope we shall not speedily part
     again. We hold life by the same tie.”</p>
    <p>“How came you in the desperate condition in which I found you?” demanded Auriol
     evasively.</p>
    <p>“I was thrown into the canal with a stone to my neck, like a dog about to be drowned,”
     replied the dwarf. “But, as you are aware, I’m not so easily disposed of.”</p>
    <p>Again the bystanders exchanged significant looks.</p>
    <p>“By whom was the attempt made?” inquired Auriol.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know the villain’s name,” rejoined the dwarf, “but he’s a very tall, dark man, and
     is generally wrapped in a long black cloak.”</p>
    <p>“Ha!” exclaimed Auriol. “When was it done?”</p>
    <p>“Some nights ago, I should fancy,” replied the dwarf, “for I’ve been a terrible long time
     under water. I have only just managed to shake off the stone.”</p>
    <p>At this speech there was a titter of incredulity among the bystanders.</p>
    <p>“You may laugh, but it’s true!” cried the dwarf angrily.</p>
    <p>“We must speak of this anon,” said Auriol. “Will you convey him to the nearest tavern?” he
     added, placing money in the hands of the man who held the dwarf in his arms.</p>
    <p>“Willingly, sir,” replied the man. “I’ll take him to the Life Guardsman, near the
     barracks—that’s the nearest public.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll join him there in an hour,” replied Auriol, moving away.</p>
    <p>And as he disappeared, the man took up his little burden, and bent his steps towards the
     barracks.</p>
    <p>Utterly disregarding the dripping state of his habiliments, Auriol proceeded quickly to the
     place of rendezvous. Arrived there, he looked around, and not seeing any one, flung himself
     upon a bench at the foot of the gentle eminence on which the gigantic statue of Achilles is
     placed.</p>
    <p>It was becoming rapidly dark, and heavy clouds, portending speedy rain, increased the gloom.
     Auriol’s thoughts were sombre as the weather and the hour, and he fell into a deep fit of
     abstraction, from which he was roused by a hand laid on his shoulder.</p>
    <p>Recoiling at the touch, he raised his eyes, and beheld the stranger leaning over him, and
     gazing at him with a look of diabolical exultation. The cloak was thrown partly aside, so as to
     display the tall, gaunt figure of its wearer; while the large collar of sable fur with which it
     was decorated stood out like the wings of a demon. The stranger’s hat was off, and his high
     broad forehead, white as marble, was fully revealed.</p>
    <p>“Our meeting must be brief,” he said. “Are you prepared to fulfil the compact?”</p>
    <p>“What do you require?” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Possession of the girl I saw three days ago,” said the other; “the iron-merchant’s daughter,
     Ebba. She must be mine.”</p>
    <p>“Never!” cried Auriol firmly—“never!”</p>
    <p>“Beware how you tempt me to exert my power,” said the stranger; “she <hi>must</hi> be
     mine—or——”</p>
    <p>“I defy you!” rejoined Auriol; “I will never consent.”</p>
    <p>“Fool!” cried the other, seizing him by the arm, and fixing a withering glance upon him.
     “Bring her to me ere the week be out, or dread my vengeance!”</p>
    <p>And, enveloping himself in his cloak, he retreated behind the statue, and was lost to
     view.</p>
    <p>As he disappeared, a moaning wind arose, and heavy rain descended. Still Auriol did not quit
     the bench.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 6</head>
    <head>The Charles the Second Spaniel</head>
    <p>It was about two o’clock, on a charming spring day, that a stout middle-aged man, accompanied
     by a young person of extraordinary beauty, took up his station in front of Langham Church. Just
     as the clock struck the hour, a young man issued at a quick pace from a cross-street, and came
     upon the couple before he was aware of it. He was evidently greatly embarrassed, and would have
     beaten a retreat, but that was impossible. His embarrassment was in some degree shared by the
     young lady; she blushed deeply, but could not conceal her satisfaction at the encounter. The
     elder individual, who did not appear to notice the confusion of either party, immediately
     extended his hand to the young man, and exclaimed:</p>
    <p>“What! Mr. Darcy, is it you? Why, we thought we had lost you, sir! What took you off so
     suddenly? We have been expecting you these four days, and were now walking about to try and
     find you. My daughter has been terribly uneasy. Haven’t you, Ebba?”</p>
    <p>The young lady made no answer to this appeal, but cast down her eyes.</p>
    <p>“It was my intention to call, and give you an explanation of my strange conduct, to-day,”
     replied Auriol. “I hope you received my letter, stating that my sudden departure was
     unavoidable.”</p>
    <p>“To be sure; and I also received the valuable snuffbox you were so good as to send me,”
     replied Mr. Thorneycroft. “But you neglected to tell me how to acknowledge the gift.”</p>
    <p>“I could not give an address at the moment,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Well, I am glad to find you have got the use of your arm again,” observed the iron-merchant;
     “but I can’t say you look so well as when you left us. You seem paler—eh? what do you think,
     Ebba?”</p>
    <p>“Mr. Darcy looks as if he were suffering from mental anxiety rather than from bodily
     ailment,” she replied timidly.</p>
    <p>“I am so,” replied Auriol, regarding her fixedly. “A very disastrous circumstance has
     happened to me. But answer me one question: Has the mysterious person in the black cloak
     troubled you again?”</p>
    <p>“What mysterious person?” demanded Mr. Thorneycroft, opening his eyes.</p>
    <p>“Never mind, father,” replied Ebba. “I saw him last night,” she added to Auriol. “I was
     sitting in the back room alone, wondering what had become of you, when I heard a tap against
     the window, which was partly open, and, looking up, I beheld the tall stranger. It was nearly
     dark, but the light of the fire revealed his malignant countenance. I don’t exaggerate, when I
     say his eyes gleamed like those of a tiger. I was terribly frightened, but something prevented
     me from crying out. After gazing at me for a few moments, with a look that seemed to fascinate
     while it frightened me, he said—‘You desire to see Auriol Darcy. I have just quitted him. Go to
     Langham Place to-morrow, and, as the clock strikes two, you will behold him.’ Without waiting
     for any reply on my part, he disappeared.”</p>
    <p>“Ah, you never told me this, you little rogue!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft. “You persuaded me to
     come out with you, in the hope of meeting Mr. Darcy; but you did not say you were sure to find
     him. So you sent this mysterious gentleman to her, eh?” he added to Auriol.</p>
    <p>“No, I did not,” replied the other gloomily.</p>
    <p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the iron-merchant, with a puzzled look.</p>
    <p>“Oh, then I suppose he thought it might relieve her anxiety. However, since we have met, I
     hope you’ll walk home and dine with us.”</p>
    <p>Auriol was about to decline the invitation, but Ebba glanced at him entreatingly.</p>
    <p>“I have an engagement, but I will forego it,” he said, offering his arm to her.</p>
    <p>And they walked along towards Oxford Street, while Mr. Thorneycroft followed, a few paces
     behind them.</p>
    <p>“This is very kind of you, Mr. Darcy,” said Ebba. “Oh, I have been so wretched!”</p>
    <p>“I grieve to hear it,” he rejoined. “I hoped you had forgotten me.”</p>
    <p>“I am sure you did not think so,” she cried.</p>
    <p>As she spoke, she felt a shudder pass through Auriol’s frame.</p>
    <p>“What ails you?” she anxiously inquired.</p>
    <p>“I would have shunned you, if I could, Ebba,” he replied; “but a fate, against which it is
     vain to contend, has brought us together again.”</p>
    <p>“I am glad of it,” she replied; “because, ever since our last interview, I have been
     reflecting on what you then said to me, and am persuaded you are labouring under some strange
     delusion, occasioned by your recent accident.”</p>
    <p>“Be not deceived, Ebba,” cried Auriol. “I am under a terrible influence. I need not remind
     you of the mysterious individual who tapped at your window last night.”</p>
    <p>“What of him?” demanded Ebba, with a thrill of apprehension.</p>
    <p>“He it is who controls my destiny,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“But what has he to do with me?” asked Ebba.</p>
    <p>“Much, much,” he replied, with a perceptible shudder.</p>
    <p>“You terrify me, Auriol,” she rejoined. “Tell me what you mean—in pity, tell me?”</p>
    <p>Before Auriol could reply, Mr. Thorneycroft stepped forward, and turned the conversation into
     another channel.</p>
    <p>Soon after this, they reached the Quadrant, and were passing beneath the eastern colonnade,
     when Ebba’s attention was attracted towards a man who was leading a couple of dogs by a string,
     while he had others under his arm, others again in his pocket, and another in his breast. It
     was Mr. Ginger.</p>
    <p>“What a pretty little dog!” cried Ebba, remarking the Charles the Second spaniel.</p>
    <p>“Allow me to present you with it?” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“You know I should value it, as coming from you,” she replied, blushing deeply; “but I cannot
     accept it; so I will not look at it again, for fear I should be tempted.”</p>
    <p>The dog-fancier, however, noticing Ebba’s admiration, held forward the spaniel, and said, “Do
     jist look at the pretty little creater, miss. It han’t its equil for beauty. Don’t be afeerd on
     it, miss. It’s as gentle as a lamb.”</p>
    <p>“Oh you little darling!” Ebba said, patting its sleek head and long silken ears, while it
     fixed its large black eyes upon her, as if entreating her to become its purchaser.</p>
    <p>“Fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you, miss,” observed Ginger; “and she ain’t i’
     the habit o’ fallin’ i’ love at first sight. I don’t wonder at it, though, for my part. I
     should do jist the same, if I wos in her place. Vell, now, miss, as she seems to like you, and
     you seem to like her, I won’t copy the manners o’ them ’ere fathers as has stony ‘arts, and
     part two true lovyers. You shall have her a bargin.”</p>
    <p>“What do you call a bargain, my good man?” inquired Ebba, smiling.</p>
    <p>“I wish I could afford to give her to you, miss,” replied Ginger; “you should have her, and
     welcome. But I must airn a livelihood, and Fairy is the most wallerable part o’ my stock. I’ll
     tell you wot I give for her myself, and you shall have her at a trifle beyond it. I’d scorn to
     take adwantage o’ the likes o’ you.”</p>
    <p>“I hope you didn’t give too much, then, friend,” replied Ebba.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t give hayf her wally—not hayf,” said Ginger; “and if so be you don’t like her in a
     month’s time, I’ll buy her back again from you. You’ll alvays find me here—alvays. Everybody
     knows Mr. Ginger—that’s my name, miss. I’m the only honest man in the dog-fancyin’ line. Ask
     Mr. Bishop, the great gunmaker o’ Bond Street, about me—him as the nobs calls the Bishop o’
     Bond Street—an’ he’ll tell you.”</p>
    <p>“But you haven’t answered the lady’s question,” said Auriol. “What do you ask for the
     dog?”</p>
    <p>“Do you want it for yourself, sir, or for her?” inquired Ginger.</p>
    <p>“What does it matter?” cried Auriol angrily.</p>
    <p>“A great deal, sir,” replied Ginger; “it’ll make a mater’al difference in the price. To you
     she’ll be five-an’-twenty guineas. To the young lady, twenty.”</p>
    <p>“But suppose I buy her for the young lady?” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Oh, then, in coorse, you’ll get her at the lower figure!” replied Ginger.</p>
    <p>“I hope you don’t mean to buy the dog?” interposed Mr. Thorneycroft. “The price is
     monstrous—preposterous.”</p>
    <p>“It may appear so to you, sir,” said Ginger, “because you’re ignorant o’ the wally of sich a
     hanimal; but I can tell you, it’s cheap—dirt cheap. Vy, his Excellency the Prooshan Ambassador
     bought a Charley from me, t’other week, to present to a certain duchess of his acquaintance,
     and wot d’ye think he give for it?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know, and I don’t want to know,” replied Mr. Thorneycroft gruffly.</p>
    <p>“Eighty guineas,” said Ginger. “Eighty guineas, as I’m a livin’ man, and made no bones about
     it neither. The dog I sold him warn’t to be compared wi’ Fairy.”</p>
    <p>“Stuff—stuff!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft; “I ain’t to be gammoned in that way.”</p>
    <p>“It’s no gammon,” said Ginger. “Look at them ears, miss—vy, they’re as long as your own
     ringlets—and them pads—an’ I’m sure you von’t say she’s dear at twenty pound.”</p>
    <p>“She’s a lovely little creature, indeed,” returned Ebba, again patting the animal’s head.</p>
    <p>While this was passing, two men of very suspicious mien, ensconced behind a pillar adjoining
     the group, were reconnoitring Auriol.</p>
    <p>“It’s him!” whispered the taller and darker of the two to his companion—“it’s the young man
     ve’ve been lookin’ for—Auriol Darcy.”</p>
    <p>“It seems like him,” said the other, edging round the pillar as far as he could without
     exposure. “I vish he’d turn his face a leetle more this vay.”</p>
    <p>“It’s him, I tell you, Sandman,” said the Tinker. “Ve must give the signal to our
     comrade.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, I’ll tell you wot it is, miss,” said Ginger coaxingly, “your sveet’art—I’m sure he’s
     your sveet’art—I can tell these things in a minnit—your sveet’art, I say, shall give me fifteen
     pound, and the dog’s yourn. I shall lose five pound by the transaction; but I don’t mind it for
     sich a customer as you. Fairy desarves a kind missus.”</p>
    <p>Auriol, who had fallen into a fit of abstraction, here remarked:</p>
    <p>“What’s that you are saying, fellow?”</p>
    <p>“I vos a-sayin’, sir, the young lady shall have the dog for fifteen pound, and a precious
     bargin it is,” replied Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Well, then, I close with you. Here’s the money,” said Auriol, taking out his purse.</p>
    <p>“On no account, Auriol,” cried Ebba quickly. “It’s too much.”</p>
    <p>“A great deal too much, Mr. Darcy,” said Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“Auriol and Darcy!” muttered Ginger. “Can this be the gemman ve’re a-lookin’ for. Vere’s my
     two pals, I vonder? Oh, it’s all right!” he added, receiving a signal from behind the pillar.
     “They’re on the look-out, I see.”</p>
    <p>“Give the lady the dog, and take the money, man,” said Auriol sharply.</p>
    <p>“Beg pardon, sir,” said Ginger, “but hadn’t I better carry the dog home for the young lady?
     It might meet vith some accident in the vay.”</p>
    <p>“Accident!—stuff and nonsense!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft. “The rascal only wants to follow you
     home, that he may know where you live, and steal the dog back again. Take my advice, Mr. Darcy,
     and don’t buy it.”</p>
    <p>“The bargain’s concluded,” said Ginger, delivering the dog to Ebba, and taking the money from
     Auriol, which, having counted, he thrust into his capacious breeches pocket.</p>
    <p>“How shall I thank you for this treasure, Auriol?” exclaimed Ebba, in an ecstasy of
     delight.</p>
    <p>“By transferring to it all regard you may entertain for me,” he replied, in a low tone.</p>
    <p>“That is impossible,” she answered.</p>
    <p>“Well, I vote we drive away at once,” said Mr. Thorneycroft. “Halloa! jarvey!” he cried,
     hailing a coach that was passing; adding, as the vehicle stopped, “Now get in, Ebba. By this
     means we shall avoid being followed by the rascal.”</p>
    <p>So saying, he got into the coach. As Auriol was about to follow him, he felt a slight touch
     on his arm, and, turning, beheld a tall and very forbidding man by his side.</p>
    <p>“Beg pardin, sir,” said the fellow, touching his hat, “but ain’t your name Mr. Auriol
     Darcy?”</p>
    <p>“It is,” replied Auriol, regarding him fixedly. “Why do you ask?”</p>
    <p>“I vants a vord or two vith you in private—that’s all, sir,” replied the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Say what you have to say at once,” rejoined Auriol. “I know nothing of you.”</p>
    <p>“You’ll know me better by-and-by, sir,” said the Tinker, in a significant tone. “I
      <hi>must</hi> speak to you, and alone.”</p>
    <p>“If you don’t go about your business, fellow, instantly, I’ll give you in charge of the
     police,” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“No, you von’t, sir—no, you von’t,” replied the Tinker, shaking his head. And then, lowering
     his voice, he added, “You’ll be glad to purchase my silence ven you larns wot secrets o’ yourn
     has come to my knowledge.”</p>
    <p>“Won’t you get in, Mr. Darcy?” cried Thorneycroft, whose back was towards the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“I must speak to this man,” replied Auriol. “I’ll come to you in the evening. Till then,
     farewell, Ebba.” And, as the coach drove away, he added to the Tinker, “Now, rascal, what have
     you to say?”</p>
    <p>“Step this vay, sir,” replied the Tinker. “There’s two friends o’ mine as vishes to be
     present at our conference. Ve’d better valk into a back street.”</p>

    <head>The Hand Again!</head>
    <p>Followed by Auriol, who, in his turn, was followed by Ginger and the Sandman, the Tinker
     directed his steps to Great Windmill Street, where he entered a public-house, called the Black
     Lion. Leaving his four-footed attendants with the landlord, with whom he was acquainted, Ginger
     caused the party to be shown into a private room, and, on entering it, Auriol flung himself
     into a chair, while the dog-fancier stationed himself near the door.</p>
    <p>“Now, what do you want with me?” demanded Auriol.</p>
    <p>“You shall learn presently,” replied the Tinker; “but first, it may be as vell to state, that
     a certain pocket-book has been found.”</p>
    <p>“Ah!” exclaimed Auriol. “You are the villains who beset me in the ruined house in the
     Vauxhall Road.”</p>
    <p>“Your pocket-book has been found, I tell you,” replied the Tinker, “and from it ve have made
     the most awful diskiveries. Our werry ‘air stood on end ven ve first read the shockin’
     particulars. What a bloodthirsty ruffian you must be! Vy, ve finds you’ve been i’ the habit o’
     makin’ avay with a young ooman vonce every ten years. Your last wictim wos in 1820—the last but
     one, in 1810—and the one before her, in 1800.”</p>
    <p>“Hangin’s too good for you!” cried the Sandman; “but if ve peaches you’re sartin to
     sving.”</p>
    <p>“I hope that pretty creater I jist see ain’t to be the next wictim?” said Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Peace!” thundered Auriol. “What do you require?”</p>
    <p>“A hundred pound each’ll buy our silence,” replied the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Ve ought to have double that,” said the Sandman, “for screenin’ sich atterocious crimes as
     he has parpetrated. Ve’re not werry partic’lar ourselves, but ve don’t commit murder
     wholesale.”</p>
    <p>“Ve don’t commit murder at all,” said Ginger.</p>
    <p>“You may fancy,” pursued the Tinker, “that ve ain’t perfectly acvainted with your history,
     but to prove that ve are, I’ll just rub up your memory. Did you ever hear tell of a gemman as
     murdered Doctor Lamb, the famous halchemist o’ Queen Bess’s time, and, havin’ drank the ‘lixir
     vich the doctor had made for hisself, has lived ever since? Did you ever hear tell of such a
     person, I say?”</p>
    <p>Auriol gazed at him in astonishment.</p>
    <p>“What idle tale are you inventing?” he said at length.</p>
    <p>“It is no idle tale,” replied the Tinker boldly. “Ve can bring a vitness as’ll prove the
     fact—a livin’ vitness.”</p>
    <p>“What witness?” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Don’t you reckilect the dwarf as used to serve Doctor Lamb?” rejoined the Tinker. “He’s
     alive still; and ve calls him Old Parr, on account of his great age.”</p>
    <p>“Where is he?—what has become of him?” demanded Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Oh, ve’ll perduce him in doo time,” replied the Tinker cunningly.</p>
    <p>“But tell me where the poor fellow is?” cried Auriol. “Have you seen him since last night? I
     sent him to a public-house at Kensington, but he has disappeared from it, and I can discover no
     traces of him.”</p>
    <p>“He’ll turn up somewhere—never fear,” rejoined the Tinker. “But now, sir, that ve fairly
     understands each other, are you agreeable to our terms? You shall give us an order for the
     money, and ve’ll undertake, on our parts, not to mislest you more.”</p>
    <p>“The pocket-book must be delivered up to me if I assent,” said Auriol, “and the poor dwarf
     must be found.”</p>
    <p>“Vy, as to that, I can scarcely promise,” replied the Tinker; “there’s a difficulty in the
     case, you see. But the pocket-book’ll never be brought aginst you—you may rest assured o’
     that.”</p>
    <p>“I must have it, or you get nothing from me,” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Here’s a bit o’ paper as come from the pocket-book,” said Ginger. “Would you like to hear
     wot’s written upon it? Here are the words: ‘How many crimes have I to reproach myself with! How
     many innocents have I destroyed! And all owing to my fatal compact with——’”</p>
    <p>“Give me that paper,” cried Auriol, rising, and attempting to snatch it from the
     dog-fancier.</p>
    <p>Just as this moment, and while Ginger retreated from Auriol, the door behind him was
     noiselessly opened—a hand was thrust through the chink—and the paper was snatched from his
     grasp. Before Ginger could turn round, the door was closed again.</p>
    <p>“Halloa! What’s that?” he cried. “The paper’s gone!”</p>
    <p>“The hand again!” cried the Sandman, in alarm. “See who’s in the passage—open the
     door—quick!”</p>
    <p>Ginger cautiously complied, and, peeping forth, said—</p>
    <p>“There’s no one there. It must be the devil. I’ll have nuffin’ more to do wi’ the
     matter.”</p>
    <p>“Poh! poh! don’t be so chicken-‘arted!” cried the Tinker. “But come what may, the gemman
     shan’t stir till he undertakes to pay us three hundred pounds.”</p>
    <p>“You seek to frighten me in vain, villain,” cried Auriol, upon whom the recent occurrence had
     not been lost. “I have but to stamp my foot, and I can instantly bring assistance that shall
     overpower you.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t provoke him,” whispered Ginger, plucking the Tinker’s sleeve. “For my part, I shan’t
     stay any longer. I wouldn’t take his money.” And he quitted the room.</p>
    <p>“I’ll go and see wot’s the matter wi’ Ginger,” said the Sandman, slinking after him.</p>
    <p>The Tinker looked nervously round. He was not proof against his superstitious fears.</p>
    <p>“Here, take this purse, and trouble me no more!” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>The Tinker’s hands clutched the purse mechanically, but he instantly laid it down again.</p>
    <p>“I’m bad enough—but I won’t sell myself to the devil,” he said.</p>
    <p>And he followed his companions.</p>
    <p>Left alone, Auriol groaned aloud, and covered his face with his hands. When he looked up, he
     found the tall man in the black cloak standing beside him. A demoniacal smile played upon his
     features.</p>
    <p>“You here?” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Of course,” replied the stranger. “I came to watch over your safety. You were in danger from
     those men. But you need not concern yourself more about them. I have your pocket-book, and the
     slip of paper that dropped from it. Here are both. Now let us talk on other matters. You have
     just parted from Ebba, and will see her again this evening.”</p>
    <p>“Perchance,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“You will,” rejoined the stranger peremptorily. “Remember, your ten years’ limit draws to a
     close. In a few days it will be at an end; and if you renew it not, you will incur the penalty,
     and you know it to be terrible. With the means of renewal in your hands, why hesitate?”</p>
    <p>“Because I will not sacrifice the girl,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“You cannot help yourself,” cried the stranger scornfully. “I command you to bring her to
     me.”</p>
    <p>“I persist in my refusal,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“It is useless to brave my power,” said the stranger. “A moon is just born. When it has
     attained its first quarter, Ebba shall be mine. Till then, farewell.”</p>
    <p>And as the words were uttered, he passed through the door.</p>

    <head>Chapter 8</head>
    <head>The Barber of London</head>
    <p>Who has not heard of the Barber of London? His dwelling is in the neighbourhood of Lincoln’s
     Inn. It is needless to particularise the street, for everybody knows the shop; that is to say,
     every member of the legal profession, high or low. All, to the very judges themselves, have
     their hair cut, or their wigs dressed, by him. A pleasant fellow is Mr. Tuffnell Trigge—Figaro
     himself not pleasanter—and if you do not shave yourself—if you want a becoming flow imparted to
     your stubborn locks, or if you require a wig, I recommend you to the care of Mr. Tuffnell
     Trigge. Not only will he treat you well, but he will regale you with all the gossip of the
     court; he will give you the last funny thing of Mr. Serjeant Larkins; he will tell you how many
     briefs the great Mr. Skinner Fyne receives—what the Vice-Chancellor is doing; and you will own,
     on rising, that you have never spent a five minutes more agreeably. Besides, you are likely to
     see some noticeable characters, for Mr. Trigge’s shop is quite a lounge. Perhaps you may find a
     young barrister who has just been “called,” ordering his “first wig,” and you may hear the
     prognostications of Mr. Trigge as to his future distinction. “Ah, sir,” he will say, glancing
     at the stolid features of the young man, “you have quite the face of the Chief Justice—quite
     the face of the chief—I don’t recollect him ordering his first wig—that was a little before my
     time; but I hope to live to see you chief, sir. Quite within your reach, if you choose to
     apply. Sure of it, sir—quite sure.” Or you may see him attending to some grave master in
     Chancery, and listening with profound attention to his remarks; or screaming with laughter at
     the jokes of some smart special pleader; or talking of the theatres, the actors and actresses,
     to some young attorneys, or pupils in conveyancers’ chambers; for those are the sort of
     customers in whom Mr. Trigge chiefly delights; with them, indeed, he <hi>is</hi> great, for it
     is by them he has been dubbed the Barber of London. His shop is also frequented by managing
     clerks, barristers’ clerks, engrossing clerks, and others; but these are, for the most part,
     his private friends.</p>
    <p>Mr. Trigge’s shop is none of your spruce West End hair-cutting establishments, with
     magnificent mirrors on every side, in which you may see the back of your head, the front, and
     the side, all at once, with walls bedizened with glazed French paper, and with an ante-room
     full of bears’-grease, oils, creams, tooth-powders, and cut glass. No, it is a real barber’s
     and hairdresser’s shop, of the good old stamp, where you may get cut and curled for a shilling,
     and shaved for half the price.</p>
    <p>True, the floor is not covered with a carpet. But what of that? It bears the imprint of
     innumerable customers, and is scattered over with their hair. In the window, there is an
     assortment of busts moulded in wax, exhibiting the triumphs of Mr. Trigge’s art; and above
     these are several specimens of legal wigs. On the little counter behind the window, amid large
     pots of pomade and bears’-grease, and the irons and brushes in constant use by the barber, are
     other bustos, done to the life, and for ever glancing amiably into the room. On the block is a
     judge’s wig, which Mr. Trigge has just been dressing, and a little farther, on a higher block,
     is that of a counsel. On either side of the fireplace are portraits of Lord Eldon and Lord
     Lyndhurst. Some other portraits of pretty actresses are likewise to be seen. Against the
     counter rests a board, displaying the playbill of the evening; and near it is a large piece of
     emblematical crockery, indicating that bears’-grease may be had on the premises. Amongst Mr.
     Trigge’s live-stock may be enumerated his favourite magpie, placed in a wicker cage in the
     window, which chatters incessantly, and knows everything, its master avouches, “as well as a
     Christian.”</p>
    <p>And now as to Mr. Tuffnell Trigge himself. He is very tall and very thin, and holds himself
     so upright that he loses not an inch of his stature. His head is large and his face long, with
     marked, if not very striking features, charged, it must be admitted, with a very self-satisfied
     expression. One cannot earn the appellation of the Barber of London without talent; and it is
     the consciousness of this talent that lends to Mr. Trigge’s features their apparently conceited
     expression. A fringe of black whisker adorns his cheek and chin, and his black bristly hair is
     brushed back, so as to exhibit the prodigious expanse of his forehead. His eyebrows are
     elevated, as if in constant scorn.</p>
    <p>The attire in which Mr. Trigge is ordinarily seen, consists of a black velvet waistcoat, and
     tight black continuations. These are protected by a white apron tied round his waist, with
     pockets to hold his scissors and combs; over all, he wears a short nankeen jacket, into the
     pockets of which his hands are constantly thrust when not otherwise employed. A black satin
     stock with a large bow encircles his throat, and his shirt is fastened by black enamel studs.
     Such is Mr. Tuffnell Trigge, yclept the Barber of London.</p>
    <p>At the time of his introduction to the reader, Mr. Trigge had just advertised for an
     assistant, his present young man, Rutherford Watts, being about to leave him, and set up for
     himself in Canterbury. It was about two o’clock, and Mr. Trigge had just withdrawn into an
     inner room to take some refection, when, on returning, he found Watts occupied in cutting the
     hair of a middle-aged, sour-looking gentleman, who was seated before the fire. Mr. Trigge bowed
     to the sour-looking gentleman, and appeared ready to enter into conversation with him, but no
     notice being taken of his advances, he went and talked to his magpie.</p>
    <p>While he was chattering to it, the sagacious bird screamed forth: “Pretty dear!—pretty
     dear!”</p>
    <p>“Ah! what’s that? Who is it?” cried Trigge.</p>
    <p>“Pretty dear!—pretty dear!” reiterated the magpie.</p>
    <p>Upon this, Trigge looked around, and saw a very singular little man enter the shop. He had
     somewhat the appearance of a groom, being clothed in a long grey coat, drab knees, and small
     top-boots. He had a large and remarkably projecting mouth, like that of a baboon, and a great
     shock head of black hair.</p>
    <p>“Pretty dear!—pretty dear!” screamed the magpie.</p>
    <p>“I see nothing pretty about him,” thought Mr. Trigge. “What a strange little fellow! It would
     puzzle the Lord Chancellor himself to say what his age might be.”</p>
    <p>The little man took off his hat, and making a profound bow to the barber, unfolded the
      <hi>Times</hi> newspaper, which he carried under his arm, and held it up to Trigge.</p>
    <p>“What do you want, my little friend, eh?” said the barber.</p>
    <p>“High wages!—high wages!” screamed the magpie.</p>
    <p>“Is this yours, sir?” replied the little man, pointing to an advertisement in the
     newspaper.</p>
    <p>“Yes, yes, that’s my advertisement, friend,” replied Mr. Trigge. “But what of it?”</p>
    <p>Before the little man could answer, a slight interruption occurred. While eyeing the
     new-comer, Watts neglected to draw forth the hot curling-irons, in consequence of which he
     burnt the sour-looking gentleman’s forehead, and singed his hair.</p>
    <p>“Take care, sir!” cried the gentleman furiously. “What the devil are you about?”</p>
    <p>“Yes! take care, sir, as Judge Learmouth observes to a saucy witness,” cried Trigge—”‘take
     care, or I’ll commit you!’”</p>
    <p>“D—n Judge Learmouth!” cried the gentleman angrily. “If I were a judge, I’d hang such a
     careless fellow.”</p>
    <p>“Sarve him right!” screamed Mag—“sarve him right!”</p>

    <p>“Beg pardon, sir,” cried Watts. “I’ll rectify you in a minute.”</p>
    <p>“Well, my little friend,” observed Trigge, “and what may be your object in coming to me? as
     the great conveyancer, Mr. Plodwell, observes to his clients—what may be your object?”</p>
    <p>“You want an assistant, don’t you, sir?” rejoined the little man humbly.</p>
    <p>“Do you apply on your own account, or on behalf of a friend?” asked Trigge.</p>
    <p>“On my own,” replied the little man.</p>
    <p>“What are your qualifications?” demanded Trigge—“what are your qualifications?”</p>
    <p>“I fancy I understand something of the business,” replied the little man. “I was a perruquier
     myself, when wigs were more in fashion than they are now.”</p>
    <p>“Ha! indeed!” said Trigge, laughing. “That must have been in the last century—in Queen Anne’s
     time—eh?”</p>
    <p>“You have hit it exactly, sir,” replied the little man. “It <hi>was</hi> in Queen Anne’s
     time.”</p>
    <p>“Perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn, my little Nestor?” cried Mr. Trigge.</p>
    <p>“Perfectly,” replied the little man. “French periwigs were first worn in Charles the Second’s
     time.”</p>
    <p>“You saw ’em, of course?” cried the barber, with a sneer.</p>
    <p>“I did,” replied the little man quietly.</p>
    <p>“Oh, he must be out of his mind,” cried Trigge. “We shall have a commission <hi>de
      lunatico</hi> to issue here, as the Master of the Rolls would observe.”</p>
    <p>“I hope I may suit you, sir,” said the little man.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think you will, my friend,” replied Mr. Trigge; “I don’t think you will. You don’t
     seem to have a hand for hairdressing. Are you aware of the talent the art requires? Are you
     aware what it has cost me to earn the enviable title of the Barber of London? I’m as proud of
     that title as if I were——”</p>
    <p>“Lord Chancellor!—Lord Chancellor!” screamed Mag.</p>
    <p>“Precisely, Mag,” said Mr. Trigge; “as if I were Lord Chancellor.”</p>
    <p>“Well, I’m sorry for it,” said the little man disconsolately.</p>
    <p>“Pretty dear!” screamed Mag; “pretty dear!”</p>
    <p>“What a wonderful bird you have got!” said the sour-looking gentleman, rising and paying Mr.
     Trigge. “I declare its answers are quite appropriate.”</p>
    <p>“Ah! Mag is a clever creature, sir—that she is,” replied the barber. “I gave a good deal for
     her.”</p>
    <p>“Little or nothing!” screamed Mag—“little or nothing!”</p>
    <p>“What is your name, friend?” said the gentleman, addressing the little man, who still
     lingered in the shop.</p>
    <p>“Why, sir, I’ve had many names in my time,” he replied. “At one time I was called
     Flapdragon—at another, Old Parr—but my real name, I believe, is Morse—Gregory Morse.”</p>
    <p>“An Old Bailey answer,” cried Mr. Trigge, shaking his head. “Flapdragon, alias Old Parr—alias
     Gregory Morse—alias——”</p>
    <p>“Pretty dear!” screamed Mag.</p>
    <p>“And you want a place?” demanded the sour-looking gentleman, eyeing him narrowly.</p>
    <p>“Sadly,” replied Morse.</p>
    <p>“Well, then, follow me,” said the gentleman, “and I’ll see what can be done for you.”</p>
    <p>And they left the shop together.</p>

    <head>The Moon in the First Quarter</head>
    <p>In spite of his resolution to the contrary, Auriol found it impossible to resist the
     fascination of Ebba’s society, and became a daily visitor at her father’s house. Mr.
     Thorneycroft noticed the growing attachment between them with satisfaction. His great wish was
     to see his daughter united to the husband of her choice, and in the hope of smoothing the way,
     he let Auriol understand that he should give her a considerable marriage portion.</p>
    <p>For the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken place in Auriol’s manner, and he
     seemed to have shaken off altogether the cloud that had hitherto sat upon his spirits.
     Enchanted by the change, Ebba indulged in the most blissful anticipations of the future.</p>
    <p>One evening they walked forth together, and almost unconsciously directed their steps towards
     the river. Lingering on its banks, they gazed on the full tide, admired the glorious sunset,
     and breathed over and over again those tender nothings so eloquent in lovers’ ears.</p>
    <p>“Oh! how different you are from what you were a week ago,” said Ebba playfully. “Promise me
     not to indulge in any more of those gloomy fancies.”</p>
    <p>“I will not indulge in them if I can help it, rest assured, sweet Ebba,” he replied. “But my
     spirits are not always under my control. I am surprised at my own cheerfulness this
     evening.”</p>
    <p>“I never felt so happy,” she replied; “and the whole scene is in unison with my feelings. How
     soothing is the calm river flowing at our feet!—how tender is the warm sky, still flushed with
     red, though the sun has set!—And see, yonder hangs the crescent moon. She is in her first
     quarter.”</p>
    <p>“The moon in her first quarter!” cried Auriol, in a tone of anguish. “All then is over.”</p>
    <p>“What means this sudden change?” cried Ebba, frightened by his looks.</p>
    <p>“Oh, Ebba,” he replied, “I must leave you. I have allowed myself to dream of happiness too
     long. I am an accursed being, doomed only to bring misery upon those who love me. I warned you
     on the onset, but you would not believe me. Let me go, and perhaps it may not yet be too late
     to save you.”</p>
    <p>“Oh no, do not leave me!” cried Ebba. “I have no fear while you are with me.”</p>
    <p>“But you do not know the terrible fate I am linked to,” he said. “This is the night when it
     will be accomplished.”</p>
    <p>“Your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to do, dear Auriol,” she rejoined, “because
     I know them to be the fruit of a diseased imagination. Come, let us continue our walk,” she
     added, taking his arm kindly.</p>
    <p>“Ebba,” he cried, “I implore you to let me go! I have not the power to tear myself away
     unless you aid me.”</p>
    <p>“I’m glad to hear it,” she rejoined, “for then I shall hold you fast.”</p>
    <p>“You know not what you do!” cried Auriol. “Release me! oh, release me!”</p>
    <p>“In a few moments the fit will be passed,” she rejoined. “Let us walk towards the abbey.”</p>
    <p>“It is in vain to struggle against fate,” ejaculated Auriol despairingly.</p>
    <p>And he suffered himself to be led in the direction proposed.</p>
    <p>Ebba continued to talk, but her discourse fell upon a deaf ear, and at last she became silent
     too. In this way they proceeded along Millbank Street and Abingdon Street, until, turning off
     on the right, they found themselves before an old and partly-demolished building. By this time
     it had become quite dark, for the moon was hidden behind a rack of clouds, but a light was seen
     in the upper storey of the structure, occasioned, no doubt, by a fire within it, which gave a
     very picturesque effect to the broken outline of the walls.</p>
    <p>Pausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin, Ebba expressed a wish to enter it. Auriol
     offered no opposition, and passing through an arched doorway, and ascending a short, spiral,
     stone staircase, they presently arrived at a roofless chamber, which it was evident, from the
     implements and rubbish lying about, was about to be razed to the ground. On one side there was
     a large arch, partly bricked up, through which opened a narrow doorway, though at some height
     from the ground. With this a plank communicated, while beneath it lay a great heap of stones,
     amongst which were some grotesque carved heads. In the centre of the chamber was a large square
     opening, like the mouth of a trap-door, from which the top of a ladder projected, and near it
     stood a flaming brazier, which had cast forth the glare seen from below. Over the ruinous walls
     on the right hung the crescent moon, now emerged from the cloud, and shedding a ghostly glimmer
     on the scene.</p>
    <p>“What a strange place!” cried Ebba, gazing around with some apprehension. “It looks like a
     spot one reads of in romance. I wonder where that trap leads to?”</p>
    <p>“Into the vault beneath, no doubt,” replied Auriol. “But why did we come hither?”</p>
    <p>As he spoke, there was a sound like mocking laughter, but whence arising it was difficult to
     say.</p>
    <p>“Did you hear that sound?” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“It was nothing but the echo of laughter from the street,” she replied. “You alarm yourself
     without reason, Auriol.”</p>
    <p>“No, not without reason,” he cried. “I am in the power of a terrible being, who seeks to
     destroy you, and I know that he is at hand. Listen to me, Ebba, and however strange my recital
     may appear, do not suppose it the ravings of a madman, but be assured it is the truth.”</p>
    <p>“Beware!” cried a deep voice, issuing apparently from the depths of the vault.</p>
    <p>“Some one spoke,” cried Ebba. “I begin to share your apprehensions. Let us quit this
     place.”</p>
    <p>“Come, then,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Not so fast,” cried a deep voice.</p>
    <p>And they beheld the mysterious owner of the black cloak barring their passage out.</p>
    <p>“Ebba, you are mine,” cried the stranger. “Auriol has brought you to me.”</p>
    <p>“It is false!” cried Auriol. “I never will yield her to you.”</p>
    <p>“Remember your compact,” rejoined the stranger, with a mocking laugh.</p>
    <p>“Oh, Auriol!” cried Ebba, “I fear for your soul. You have not made a compact with this
     fiend?”</p>
    <p>“He has,” replied the stranger; “and by that compact you are surrendered to me.”</p>
    <p>And, as he spoke, he advanced towards her, and enveloping her in his cloak, her cries were
     instantly stifled.</p>
    <p>“You shall not go!” cried Auriol, seizing him. “Release her, or I renounce you wholly.”</p>
    <p>“Fool!” cried the stranger, “since you provoke my wrath, take your doom.”</p>
    <p>And he stamped on the ground. At this signal an arm was thrust from the trap-door, and
     Auriol’s hand was seized with an iron grasp.</p>
    <p>While this took place, the stranger bore his lovely burden swiftly up the plank leading to
     the narrow doorway in the wall, and just as he was passing through it he pointed towards the
     sky, and shouted with a mocking smile to Auriol—“Behold! the moon is in her first quarter. My
     words are fulfilled!”</p>
    <p>And he disappeared.</p>
    <p>Auriol tried to disengage himself from the grasp imposed upon him in vain. Uttering
     ejaculations of rage and despair, he was dragged forcibly backwards into the vault.</p>

    <head>The Statue at Charing Cross</head>
    <p>One morning, two persons took their way along Parliament Street and Whitehall, and, chatting
     as they walked, turned into the entrance of Spring Gardens, for the purpose of looking at the
     statue at Charing Cross. One of them was remarkable for his dwarfish stature and strange
     withered features. The other was a man of middle size, thin, rather elderly, and with a sharp
     countenance, the sourness of which was redeemed by a strong expression of benevolence. He was
     clad in a black coat, rather rusty, but well brushed, buttoned up to the chin, black tights,
     short drab gaiters, and wore a white neckcloth and spectacles.</p>
    <p>Mr. Loftus (for so he was called) was a retired merchant, of moderate fortune, and lived in
     Abingdon Street. He was a bachelor, and therefore pleased himself; and being a bit of an
     antiquary, rambled about all day long in search of some object of interest. His walk, on the
     present occasion, was taken with that view.</p>
    <p>“By Jove! what a noble statue that is, Morse!” cried Loftus, gazing at it. “The horse is
     magnificent—positively magnificent.”</p>
    <p>“I recollect when the spot was occupied by a gibbet, and when, in lieu of a statue, an effigy
     of the martyred monarch was placed there,” replied Morse. “That was in the time of the
     Protectorate.”</p>
    <p>“You cannot get those dreams out of your head, Morse,” said Loftus, smiling. “I wish I could
     persuade myself I had lived for two centuries and a half.”</p>
    <p>“Would you could have seen the ancient cross, which once stood there, erected by Edward the
     First to his beloved wife, ‘Eleanor of Castile’!” said Morse, heedless of the other’s remark.
     “It was much mutilated when I remember it; some of the pinnacles were broken, and the foliage
     defaced, but the statues of the queen were still standing in the recesses; and altogether the
     effect was beautiful.”</p>
    <p>“It must have been charming,” observed Loftus, rubbing his hands; “and, though I like the
     statue, I would much rather have had the old Gothic cross. But how fortunate the former escaped
     destruction in Oliver Cromwell’s time!”</p>
    <p>“I can tell you how that came to pass, sir,” replied Morse, “for I was assistant to John
     Rivers, the brazier, to whom the statue was sold.”</p>
    <p>“Ah! indeed!” exclaimed Loftus. “I have heard something of the story, but should like to have
     full particulars.”</p>
    <p>“You shall hear them, then,” replied Morse. “Yon statue, which, as you know, was cast by
     Hubert le Sueur, in 1633, was ordered by Parliament to be sold and broken to pieces. Well, my
     master, John Rivers, being a stanch Royalist, though he did not dare to avow his principles,
     determined to preserve it from destruction. Accordingly, he offered a good round sum for it,
     and was declared the purchaser. But how to dispose of it was the difficulty? He could trust
     none of his men but me, whom he knew to be as hearty a hater of the Roundheads, and as loyal to
     the memory of our slaughtered sovereign, as himself. Well, we digged a great pit, secretly, in
     the cellar, whither the statue had been conveyed, and buried it. The job occupied us nearly a
     month; and during that time, my master collected together all the pieces of old brass he could
     procure. These he afterwards produced, and declared they were the fragments of the statue. But
     the cream of the jest was to come. He began to cast handles of knives and forks in brass,
     giving it out that they were made from the metal of the statue. And plenty of ’em he sold too,
     for the Cavaliers bought ’em as memorials of their martyred monarch, and the Roundheads as
     evidences of his fall. In this way he soon got back his outlay.”</p>
    <p>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Loftus.</p>
    <p>“Well, in due season came the Restoration,” pursued Morse; “and my master made known to King
     Charles the Second the treasure he had kept concealed for him. It was digged forth, placed in
     its old position—but I forget whether the brazier was rewarded. I rather think not.”</p>
    <p>“No matter,” cried Loftus; “he was sufficiently rewarded by the consciousness of having done
     a noble action. But let us go and examine the sculpture on the pedestal more closely.”</p>
    <p>With this he crossed over the road; and, taking off his hat, thrust his head through the iron
     railing surrounding the pedestal, while Morse, in order to point out the beauties of the
     sculpture with greater convenience, mounted upon a stump beside him.</p>
    <p>“You are aware that this is the work of Grinling Gibbons, sir?” cried the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“To be sure I am,” replied Loftus—“to be sure. What fancy and gusto is displayed in the
     treatment of these trophies!”</p>
    <p>“The execution of the royal arms is equally admirable,” cried Morse.</p>
    <p>“Never saw anything finer,” rejoined Loftus—“never, upon my life.”</p>
    <p>Every one knows how easily a crowd is collected in London, and it cannot be supposed that our
     two antiquaries would be allowed to pursue their investigations unmolested. Several ragged
     urchins got round them, and tried to discover what they were looking at, at the same time
     cutting their jokes upon them. These were speedily joined by a street-sweeper, rather young in
     the profession, a ticket-porter, a butcher’s apprentice, an old Israelitish clothes-man, a
     coalheaver, and a couple of charity-boys.</p>
    <p>“My eyes!” cried the street-sweeper, “only twig these coves. If they ain’t green ‘uns, I’m
     done.”</p>
    <p>“Old Spectacles thinks he has found it all out,” remarked the porter; “ve shall hear wot it
     all means by-and-by.”</p>
    <p>“Plesh ma ‘art,” cried the Jew, “vat two funny old genelmen. I vonder vat they thinks they
     sees?”</p>
    <p>“I’ll tell ‘ee, master,” rejoined the butcher’s apprentice; “they’re a tryin’ vich on ’em can
     see farthest into a millstone.”</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>“Only think of living all my life in London, and never examining this admirable work of art
     before!” cried Loftus, quite unconscious that he had become the object of general
     curiosity.</p>
    <p>“Look closer at it, old gem’man,” cried the porter. “The nearer you get, the more you’ll
     admire it.”</p>
    <p>“Quite true,” replied Loftus, fancying Morse had spoken; “it’ll bear the closest
     inspection.”</p>
    <p>“I say, Ned,” observed one of the charity-boys to the other, “do you get over the railin’;
     they must ha’ dropped summat inside. See what it is.”</p>
    <p>“I’m afraid o’ spikin’ myself, Joe,” replied the other; “but just give us a lift, and I’ll
     try.”</p>
    <p>“Wot are you arter there, you young rascals?” cried the coalheaver; “come down, or I’ll send
     the perlice to you.”</p>
    <p>“Wot two precious guys these is!” cried a ragamuffin lad, accompanied by a bulldog. “I’ve a
     good mind to chuck the little ’un off the post, and set Tartar at him. Here, boy, here!”</p>
    <p>“That ‘ud be famous fun, indeed, Spicer!” cried another rapscallion behind him.</p>
    <p>“Arrah! let ’em alone, will you there, you young divils!” cried an Irish bricklayer; “don’t
     you see they’re only two paiceable antiquaries.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, they’re antiquaries, are they?” screamed the little street-sweeper. “Vell, I never see
     the likes on ’em afore; did you, Sam?”</p>
    <p>“Never,” replied the porter.</p>
    <p>“Och, murther in Irish! ye’re upsettin’ me, an’ all the fruits of my industry,” cried an
     applewoman, against whom the bricklayer had run his barrow. “Divil seize you for a careless
     wagabone! Why don’t you look where ye’re goin’, and not dhrive into people in that way?”</p>
    <p>“Axes pardon, Molly,” said the bricklayer; “but I was so inter<hi>est</hi>ed in them
     antiquaries, that I didn’t obsarve ye.”</p>
    <p>“Antiquaries be hanged! what’s such warmint to me?” cried the applewoman furiously. “You’ve
     destroyed my day’s market, and bad luck to ye!”</p>
    <p>“Well, never heed, Molly,” cried the good-natured bricklayer; “I’ll make it up t’ye. Pick up
     your apples, and you shall have a dhrop of the craiter if you’ll come along wid me.”</p>
    <p>While this was passing, a stout gentleman came from the farther side of the statue, and
     perceiving Loftus, cried—“Why, brother-in-law, is that you?”</p>
    <p>But Loftus was too much engrossed to notice him, and continued to expiate upon the beauty of
     the trophies.</p>
    <p>“What are you talking about, brother?” cried the stout gentleman.</p>
    <p>“Grinling Gibbons,” replied Loftus, without turning round. “Horace Walpole said that no one
     before him could give to wood the airy lightness of a flower, and here he has given it to a
     stone.”</p>
    <p>“This may be all very fine, my good fellow,” said the stout gentleman, seizing him by the
     shoulder; “but don’t you see the crowd you’re collecting round you? You’ll be mobbed
     presently.”</p>
    <p>“Why, how the devil did you come here, brother Thorneycroft?” cried Loftus, at last
     recognising him.</p>
    <p>“Come along, and I’ll tell you,” replied the iron-merchant, dragging him away, while Morse
     followed closely behind them. “I’m so glad to have met you,” pursued Thorneycroft, as soon as
     they were clear of the mob; “you’ll be shocked to hear what has happened to your niece,
     Ebba.”</p>
    <p>“Why, what <hi>has</hi> happened to her?” demanded Loftus. “You alarm me. Out with it at
     once. I hate to be kept in suspense.”</p>
    <p>“She has left me,” replied Thorneycroft—“left her old indulgent father—run away.”</p>
    <p>“Run away!” exclaimed Loftus. “Impossible! I’ll not believe it—even from your lips.”</p>
    <p>“Would it were not so!—but it is, alas! too true,” replied Thorneycroft mournfully. “And the
     thing was so unnecessary, for I would gladly have given her to the young man. My sole hope is
     that she has not utterly disgraced herself.”</p>
    <p>“No, she is too high principled for that,” cried Loftus. “Rest easy on that score. But with
     whom has she run away?”</p>
    <p>“With a young man named Auriol Darcy,” replied Thorneycroft. “He was brought to my house
     under peculiar circumstances.”</p>
    <p>“I never heard of him,” said Loftus.</p>
    <p>“But I have,” interposed Morse. “I’ve known him these two hundred years.”</p>
    <p>“Eh day! who’s this?” cried Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“A crack-brained little fellow, whom I’ve engaged as valet,” replied Loftus. “He fancies he
     was born in Queen Elizabeth’s time.”</p>
    <p>“It’s no fancy,” cried Morse. “I am perfectly acquainted with Auriol Darcy’s history. He
     drank of the same elixir as myself.”</p>
    <p>“If you know him, can you give us a clue to find him?” asked Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“I am sorry I cannot,” replied Morse. “I only saw him for a few minutes the other night,
     after I had been thrown into the Serpentine by the tall man in the black cloak.”</p>
    <p>“What’s that you say?” cried Thorneycroft quickly. “I have heard Ebba speak of a tall man in
     a black cloak having some mysterious connection with Auriol. I hope that person has nothing to
     do with her disappearance.”</p>
    <p>“I shouldn’t wonder if he had,” replied Morse. “I believe that black gentleman to be——”</p>
    <p>“What!—who?” demanded Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“Neither more nor less than the devil,” replied Morse mysteriously.</p>
    <p>“Pshaw! poh!” cried Loftus. “I told you the poor fellow was half cracked.”</p>
    <p>At this moment, a roguish-looking fellow, with red whiskers and hair, and clad in a velveteen
     jacket with ivory buttons, who had been watching the iron-merchant at some distance, came up,
     and touching his hat, said, “Mr. Thorneycroft, I believe?”</p>
    <p>“My name is Thorneycroft, fellow!” cried the iron-merchant, eyeing him askance. “And your
     name, I fancy, is Ginger?”</p>
    <p>“Exactly, sir,” replied the dog-fancier, again touching his hat, “ex-actly. I didn’t think
     you would rekilect me, sir. I bring you some news of your darter.”</p>
    <p>“Of Ebba!” exclaimed Thorneycroft, in a tone of deep emotion. “I hope your news is good.”</p>
    <p>“I wish it wos better, for her sake as well as yours, sir,” replied the dog-fancier gravely;
     “but I’m afeerd she’s in werry bad hands.”</p>
    <p>“That she is, if she’s in the hands o’ the black gentleman,” observed Morse.</p>
    <p>“Vy, Old Parr, that ain’t you?” cried Ginger, gazing at him in astonishment. “Vy, ‘ow you are
     transmogrified, to be sure!”</p>
    <p>“But what of my daughter?” cried Thorneycroft; “where is she? Take me to her, and you shall
     be well rewarded.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll do my best to take you to her, and without any reward, sir,” replied Ginger, “for my
     heart bleeds for the poor young creater. As I said afore, she’s in dreadful bad hands.”</p>
    <p>“Do you allude to Mr. Auriol Darcy?” cried Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“No, he’s as much a wictim of this infernal plot as your darter,” replied Ginger; “I thought
     him quite different at first—but I’ve altered my mind entirely since some matters has come to
     my knowledge.”</p>
    <p>“You alarm me greatly by these dark hints,” cried Thorneycroft. “What is to be done?”</p>
    <p>“I shall know in a few hours,” replied Ginger. “I ain’t got the exact clue yet. But come to
     me at eleven o’clock to-night, at the Turk’s Head, at the back o’ Shoreditch Church, and I’ll
     put you on the right scent. You must come alone.”</p>
    <p>“I should wish this gentleman, my brother-in-law, to accompany me,” said Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“He couldn’t help you,” replied Ginger. “I’ll take care to have plenty of assistance. It’s a
     dangerous bus’ness, and can only be managed in a sartin way, and by a sartin person, and he’d
     object to any von but you. To-night, at eleven! Good-bye, Old Parr. Ve shall meet again ere
     long.”</p>
    <p>And without a word more, he hurried away.</p>

    <head>Chapter 11</head>
    <head>Preparations</head>
    <p>On that same night, at the appointed hour, Mr. Thorneycroft repaired to Shoreditch, and
     entering a narrow street behind the church, speedily discovered the Turk’s Head, at the door of
     which a hackney-coach was standing. He was shown by the landlord into a small back room, in
     which three men were seated at a small table, smoking, and drinking gin and water, while a
     fourth was standing near the fire, with his back towards the door. The latter was a tall,
     powerfully built man, wrapped in a rough greatcoat, and did not turn round on the
     iron-merchant’s entrance.</p>
    <p>“You are punctual, Mr. Thorneycroft,” said Ginger, who was one of the trio at the table; “and
     I’m happy to say, I’ve arranged everythin’ for you, sir. My friends are ready to undertake the
     job. Only they von’t do it on quite sich easy terms as mine.”</p>
    <p>The Tinker and the Sandman coughed slightly, to intimate their entire concurrence in Mr.
     Ginger’s remark.</p>
    <p>“As I said to you this mornin’, Mr. Thorneycroft,” pursued Ginger, “this is a difficult and a
     dangerous bus’ness, and there’s no knowin’ wot may come on it. But it’s your only chance o’
     recoverin’ your darter.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, it’s your only chance,” echoed the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Ve’re about to risk our precious lives for you, sir,” said the Sandman; “so, in coorse, ve
     expects a perportionate revard.”</p>
    <p>“If you enable me to regain my daughter, you shall not find me ungrateful,” rejoined the
     iron-merchant.</p>
    <p>“I must have a hundred pounds,” said the Tinker—“that’s my lowest.”</p>
    <p>“And mine, too,” said the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“I shall take nuffin’ but the glory, as I said afore,” remarked Ginger. “I’m sworn champion
     o’ poor distressed young damsils; but my friends must make their own bargins.”</p>
    <p>“Well, I assent,” returned Mr. Thorneycroft; “and the sooner we set out the better.”</p>
    <p>“Are you armed?” asked Ginger.</p>
    <p>“I have a brace of pistols in my pocket,” replied Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“All right, then—ve’ve all got pops and cutlashes,” said Ginger. “So let’s be off.”</p>
    <p>As he spoke, the Tinker and Sandman arose; and the man in the rough greatcoat, who had
     hitherto remained with his back to them, turned round. To the iron-merchant’s surprise, he
     perceived that the face of this individual was covered with a piece of black crape.</p>
    <p>“Who is this?” he demanded with some misgiving.</p>
    <p>“A friend,” replied Ginger. “Vithout him ve could do nuffin’. His name is Reeks, and he is
     the chief man in our enterprise.”</p>
    <p>“He claims a reward too, I suppose?” said Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“I will tell you what reward I claim, Mr. Thorneycroft,” rejoined Reeks, in a deep stern
     tone, “when all is over. Meantime, give me your solemn pledge, that whatever you may behold
     to-night, you will not divulge it.”</p>
    <p>“I give it,” replied the iron-merchant, “provided always——”</p>
    <p>“No provision, sir,” interrupted the other quickly. “You must swear to keep silence
     unconditionally, or I will not move a footstep with you; and I alone can guide you where your
     daughter is detained.”</p>
    <p>“Svear, sir; it is your only chance,” whispered Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Well, if it must be, I do swear to keep silence,” rejoined Mr. Thorneycroft; “but your
     proceedings appear very mysterious.”</p>
    <p>“The whole affair is mysterious,” replied Reeks. “You must also consent to have a bandage
     passed over your eyes when you get into the coach.”</p>
    <p>“Anything more?” asked the iron-merchant.</p>
    <p>“You must engage to obey my orders, without questioning, when we arrive at our destination,”
     rejoined Reeks. “Otherwise, there is no chance of success.”</p>
    <p>“Be it as you will,” returned Thorneycroft, “I must perforce agree.”</p>
    <p>“All then is clearly understood,” said Reeks, “and we can now set out.”</p>
    <p>Upon this, Ginger conducted Mr. Thorneycroft to the coach, and as soon as the latter got into
     it, tied a handkerchief tightly over his eyes. In this state Mr. Thorneycroft heard the Tinker
     and the Sandman take their places near him, but not remarking the voice of Reeks, concluded
     that he must have got outside.</p>
    <p>The next moment, the coach was put in motion, and rattled over the stones at a rapid pace. It
     made many turns; but at length proceeded steadily onwards, while from the profound silence
     around, and the greater freshness of the air, Mr. Thorneycroft began to fancy they had gained
     the country. Not a word was spoken by any one during the ride.</p>
    <p>After a while, the coach stopped, the door was opened, and Mr. Thorneycroft was helped out.
     The iron-merchant expected his bandage would now be removed, but he was mistaken, for Reeks,
     taking his arm, drew him along at a quick pace. As they advanced, the iron-merchant’s conductor
     whispered him to be cautious, and, at the same time, made him keep close to a wall. A door was
     presently opened, and as soon as the party had passed through, it closed.</p>
    <p>The bandage was then removed from Thorneycroft’s eyes, and he found himself in a large and
     apparently neglected garden. Though the sky was cloudy, there was light enough to enable him to
     distinguish that they were near an old dilapidated mansion.</p>
    <p>“We are now arrived,” said Reeks to the iron-merchant, “and you will have need of all your
     resolution.”</p>
    <p>“I will deliver her, or perish in the attempt,” said Thorneycroft, taking out his
     pistols.</p>
    <p>The others drew their cutlasses.</p>
    <p>“Now then, follow me,” said Reeks, “and act as I direct.”</p>
    <p>With this he struck into an alley formed by thick hedges of privet, which brought them to the
     back part of the house. Passing through a door, he entered the yard, and creeping cautiously
     along the wall, reached a low window, which he contrived to open without noise. He then passed
     through it, and was followed by the others.</p>

   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 12</head>
    <head>The Chamber of Mystery</head>
    <p>We shall now return to the night of Ebba’s seizure by the mysterious stranger. Though almost
     deprived of consciousness by terror, the poor girl could distinguish, from the movements of her
     captor, that she was borne down a flight of steps, or some steep descent, and then for a
     considerable distance along level ground. She was next placed in a carriage, which was driven
     with great swiftness, and though it was impossible to conjecture in what direction she was
     conveyed, it seemed to her terrified imagination as if she were hurried down a precipice, and
     she expected every moment to be dashed in pieces. At length the vehicle stopped, and she was
     lifted out of it, and carried along a winding passage; after which, the creaking of hinges
     announced that a door was opened. Having passed through it, she was deposited on a bench, when,
     fright overmastering her, her senses completely forsook her.</p>
    <p>On recovering, she found herself seated on a fauteuil covered with black velvet, in the midst
     of a gloomy chamber of vast extent, while beside her, and supporting her from falling, stood
     the mysterious and terrible stranger. He held a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to
     her lips, and compelled her to swallow a portion of it. The powerful stimulant revived her,
     but, at the same time, produced a strange excitement, against which she struggled with all her
     power. Her persecutor again held the goblet towards her, while a sardonic smile played upon his
     features.</p>
    <p>“Drink!” he cried; “it will restore you, and you have much to go through.”</p>
    <p>Ebba mechanically took the cup, and raised it to her lips, but noticing the stranger’s glance
     of exultation, dashed it to the ground.</p>
    <p>“You have acted foolishly,” he said sternly; “the potion would have done you good.”</p>
    <p>Withdrawing her eyes from his gaze, which she felt exercised an irresistible influence over
     her, Ebba gazed fearfully round the chamber.</p>
    <p>It was vast and gloomy, and seemed like the interior of a sepulchre—the walls and ceiling
     being formed of black marble, while the floor was paved with the same material. Not far from
     where she sat, on an estrade, approached by a couple of steps, stood a table covered with black
     velvet, on which was placed an immense lamp, fashioned like an imp supporting a caldron on his
     outstretched wings. In this lamp were several burners, which cast a lurid light throughout the
     chamber. Over it hung a cap equally fantastically fashioned. A dagger, with a richly wrought
     hilt, was stuck into the table; and beside it lay a strangely shaped mask, an open book, an
     antique inkstand, and a piece of parchment, on which some characters were inscribed. Opposite
     these stood a curiously carved ebony chair.</p>
    <p>At the lower end of the room, which was slightly elevated above the rest, hung a large black
     curtain; and on the step, in the front of it, were placed two vases of jet.</p>
    <p>“What is behind that curtain?” shudderingly demanded Ebba of her companion.</p>
    <p>“You will see anon,” he replied. “Meanwhile, seat yourself on that chair, and glance at the
     writing on the scroll.”</p>
    <p>Ebba did not move, but the stranger took her hand, and drew her to the seat.</p>
    <p>“Read what is written on that paper,” he cried imperiously.</p>
    <p>Ebba glanced at the document, and a shudder passed over her frame. “By this,” she cried, “I
     surrender myself, soul and body, to you?”</p>
    <p>“You do,” replied the stranger.</p>
    <p>“I have committed no crime that can place me within the power of the Fiend,” cried Ebba,
     falling upon her knees. “I call upon Heaven for protection! Avaunt!”</p>
    <p>As the words were uttered, the cap suddenly fell upon the lamp, and the chamber was buried in
     profound darkness. Mocking laughter rang in her ears, succeeded by wailing cries inexpressibly
     dreadful to hear.</p>
    <p>Ebba continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance, and for that of Auriol. In the
     midst of her supplications she was aroused by strains of music of the most exquisite sweetness,
     proceeding apparently from behind the curtain, and while listening to these sounds she was
     startled by a deafening crash as if a large gong had been stricken. The cover of the lamp was
     then slowly raised, and the burners blazed forth as before, while from the two vases in front
     of the curtain arose clouds of incense, filling the chamber with stupefying fragrance.</p>
    <p>Again the gong was stricken, and Ebba looked round towards the curtain. Above each vase
     towered a gigantic figure, wrapped in a long black cloak, the lower part of which was concealed
     by the thick vapour. Hoods, like the cowls of monks, were drawn over the heads of these grim
     and motionless figures; mufflers enveloped their chins, and they wore masks, from the holes of
     which gleamed eyes of unearthly brightness. Their hands were crossed upon their breasts.
     Between them squatted two other spectral forms, similarly cloaked, hooded, and masked, with
     their gleaming eyes fixed upon her, and their skinny fingers pointed derisively at her.</p>
    <p>Behind the curtain was placed a strong light, which showed a wide staircase of black marble,
     leading to some upper chamber, and at the same time threw the reflection of a gigantic figure
     upon the drapery, while a hand, the finger of which pointed towards her, was thrust from an
     opening between its folds.</p>
    <p>Forcibly averting her gaze, Ebba covered her eyes with her hands, but looking up again after
     a brief space, beheld an ebon door at the side revolve upon its hinges, and give entrance to
     three female figures, robed in black, hooded and veiled, and having their hands folded, in a
     melancholy manner, across their breasts. Slowly and noiselessly advancing, they halted within a
     few paces of her.</p>
    <p>“Who and what are ye?” she cried, wild with terror.</p>
    <p>“The victims of Auriol!” replied the figure on the right. “As we are, such will you be ere
     long.”</p>
    <p>“What crime have you committed?” demanded Ebba.</p>
    <p>“We have loved him,” replied the second figure.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>“Is that a crime?” cried Ebba. “If so, I am equally culpable with you.”</p>
    <p>“You will share our doom,” replied the third figure.</p>
    <p>“Heaven have mercy upon me!” exclaimed the agonised girl, dropping upon her knees.</p>
    <p>At this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtain exclaimed, “Sign, or Auriol is lost
     for ever.”</p>
    <p>“I cannot yield my soul, even to save him,” cried Ebba distractedly.</p>
    <p>“Witness his chastisement, then,” cried the voice.</p>
    <p>And as the words were uttered, a side door was opened on the opposite side, and Auriol was
     dragged forth from it by two masked personages, who looked like familiars of the
     Inquisition.</p>
    <p>“Do not yield to the demands of this fiend, Ebba!” cried Auriol, gazing at her
     distractedly.</p>
    <p>“Will you save him before he is cast, living, into the tomb?” cried the voice.</p>
    <p>And at the words, a heavy slab of marble rose slowly from the floor near where Ebba sat, and
     disclosed a dark pit beneath.</p>
    <p>Ebba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror.</p>
    <p>“There he will be immured, unless you sign,” cried the voice; “and, as he is immortal, he
     will endure an eternity of torture.”</p>
    <p>“I cannot save him so, but I may precede him,” cried Ebba. And throwing her hands aloft, she
     flung herself into the pit.</p>
    <p>A fearful cry resounded through the chamber. It broke from Auriol, who vainly strove to burst
     from those who held him, and precipitate himself after Ebba.</p>
    <p>Soon after this, and while Auriol was gazing into the abyss, a tongue of blue flame arose
     from it, danced for a moment in the air, and then vanished. No sooner was it gone than a
     figure, shrouded in black habiliments, and hooded and muffled up like the three other female
     forms, slowly ascended from the vault, apparently without support, and remained motionless at
     its brink.</p>
    <p>“Ebba!” exclaimed Auriol, in a voice of despair. “Is it you?”</p>
    <p>The figure bowed its head, but spoke not.</p>
    <p>“Sign!” thundered the voice. “Your attempt at self-destruction has placed you wholly in my
     power. Sign!”</p>
    <p>At this injunction, the figure moved slowly towards the table, and to his unspeakable horror,
     Auriol beheld it take up the pen and write upon the parchment. He bent forward, and saw that
     the name inscribed thereon was Ebba Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>The groan to which he gave utterance was echoed by a roar of diabolical laughter.</p>
    <p>The figure then moved slowly away, and ranged itself with the other veiled forms.</p>
    <p>“All is accomplished,” cried the voice. “Away with him!”</p>
    <p>On this, a terrible clangour was heard; the lights were extinguished; and Auriol was dragged
     through the doorway from which he had been brought forth.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 1</head>
    <head>The Tomb of the Rosicrucian</head>
    <p>On the night of the 1st of March 1800, and at a late hour, a man, wrapped in a large
     horseman’s cloak, and of strange and sinister appearance, entered an old deserted house in the
     neighbourhood of Stepney Green. He was tall, carried himself very erect, and seemed in the full
     vigour of early manhood; but his features had a worn and ghastly look, as if bearing the stamp
     of long-indulged and frightful excesses, while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an expression
     almost diabolical.</p>
    <p>This person had gained the house from a garden behind it, and now stood in a large dismantled
     hall, from which a broad oaken staircase, with curiously-carved banisters, led to a gallery,
     and thence to the upper chambers of the habitation. Nothing could be more dreary than the
     aspect of the place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with spiders’ webs, and in some
     places had fallen in heaps upon the floor; the glories of the tapestry upon the walls were
     obliterated by damps; the squares of black and white marble, with which the hall was paved,
     were loosened, and quaked beneath the footsteps; the wide and empty fireplace yawned like the
     mouth of a cavern; the bolts of the closed windows were rusted in their sockets; and the heaps
     of dust before the outer door proved that long years had elapsed since any one had passed
     through it.</p>
    <p>Taking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak, the individual in question gazed for a moment
     around him, and then, with a sardonic smile playing upon his features, directed his steps
     towards a room on the right, the door of which stood open.</p>
    <p>This chamber, which was large and cased with oak, was wholly unfurnished, like the hall, and
     in an equally dilapidated condition. The only decoration remaining on its walls was the
     portrait of a venerable personage in the cap and gown of Henry the Eighth’s time, painted
     against a panel—a circumstance which had probably saved it from destruction—and beneath it,
     fixed in another panel, a plate of brass, covered with mystical characters and symbols, and
     inscribed with the name “Cyprianus de Rougemont, Fra. R.C.” The same name likewise appeared
     upon a label beneath the portrait, with the date 1550.</p>
    <p>Pausing before the portrait, the young man threw the light of the lantern full upon it, and
     revealed features somewhat resembling his own in form, but of a severe and philosophic cast. In
     the eyes alone could be discerned the peculiar and terrible glimmer which distinguished his own
     glances.</p>
    <p>After regarding the portrait for some time fixedly, he thus addressed it:</p>
    <p>“Dost hear me, old ancestor?” he cried. “I, thy descendant, Cyprian de Rougemont, call upon
     thee to point out where thy gold is hidden? I know that thou wert a brother of the Rosy
     Cross—one of the illuminati—and didst penetrate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region
     of light. I know, also, that thou wert buried in this house with a vast treasure; but though I
     have made diligent search for it, and others have searched before me, thy grave has never yet
     been discovered! Listen to me! Methought Satan appeared to me in a dream last night, and bade
     me come hither, and I should find what I sought. The conditions he proposed were, that I should
     either give him my own soul, or win him that of Auriol Darcy. I assented. I am here. Where is
     thy treasure?”</p>
    <p>After a pause, he struck the portrait with his clenched hand, exclaiming in a loud voice:</p>
    <p>“Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor? I call on thee to give me thy treasure. Dost hear, I
     say?”</p>
    <p>And he repeated the blow with greater violence.</p>
    <p>Disturbed by the shock, the brass plate beneath the picture started from its place, and fell
     to the ground.</p>
    <p>“What is this?” cried Rougemont, gazing into the aperture left by the plate. “Ha!—my
     invocation has been heard!”</p>
    <p>And, snatching up the lantern, he discovered, at the bottom of a little recess, about two
     feet deep, a stone, with an iron ring in the centre of it. Uttering a joyful cry, he seized the
     ring, and drew the stone forward without difficulty, disclosing an open space beyond it.</p>
    <p>“This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor’s tomb,” cried Rougemont; “there can be no doubt
     of it. The old Rosicrucian has kept his secret well; but the devil has helped me to wrest it
     from him. And now to procure the necessary implements, in case, as is not unlikely, I should
     experience further difficulty.”</p>
    <p>With this he hastily quitted the room, but returned almost immediately with a mallet, a
     lever, and a pitchfork; armed with which and the lantern, he crept through the aperture. This
     done, he found himself at the head of a stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the
     arched entrance of a vault. The door, which was of stout oak, was locked, but holding up the
     light towards it, he read the following inscription:</p>
    <quote>
     <l>“POST C.C.L. ANNOS PATEBO, 1550.”</l></quote>
    <p>“In two hundred and fifty years I shall open!” cried Rougemont, “and the date 1550—why, the
     exact time is arrived. Old Cyprian must have foreseen what would happen, and evidently intended
     to make me his heir. There was no occasion for the devil’s interference. And see, the key is in
     the lock. So!” And he turned it, and pushing against the door with some force, the rusty hinges
     gave way, and it fell inwards.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>From the aperture left by the fallen door, a soft and silvery light streamed forth, and,
     stepping forward, Rougemont found himself in a spacious vault, from the ceiling of which hung a
     large globe of crystal, containing in its heart a little flame, which diffused a radiance,
     gentle as that of the moon, around. This, then, was the ever-burning lamp of the Rosicrucians,
     and Rougemont gazed at it with astonishment. Two hundred and fifty years had elapsed since that
     wondrous flame had been lighted, and yet it burnt on brightly as ever. Hooped round the globe
     was a serpent with its tail in its mouth—an emblem of eternity—wrought in purest gold; while
     above it were a pair of silver wings, in allusion to the soul. Massive chains of the more
     costly metal, fashioned like twisted snakes, served as suspenders to the lamp.</p>
    <p>But Rougemont’s astonishment at this marvel quickly gave way to other feelings, and he gazed
     around the vault with greedy eyes.</p>
    <p>It was a septilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built of stone, and supported by
     beautifully groined arches. The surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the chisel
     had only just left it.</p>
    <p>In six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented with ironwork of the most
     exquisite workmanship, and these Rougemont’s imagination pictured as filled with inexhaustible
     treasure; while in the seventh corner, near the door, was a beautiful little piece of
     monumental sculpture in white marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures, holding a
     veil between them, which partly concealed the entrance to a small recess. On one of the chests
     opposite the monument just described stood a strangely-formed bottle and a cup of antique
     workmanship, both encrusted with gems.</p>
    <p>The walls were covered with circles, squares, and diagrams, and in some places were
     ornamented with grotesque carvings. In the centre of the vault was a round altar, of black
     marble, covered with a plate of gold, on which Rougemont read the following inscription:</p>
    <quote>
     <l>“Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulcrum feci.”</l></quote>
    <p>“Here, then, old Cyprian lies,” he cried.</p>
    <p>And, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized the altar by the upper rim, and
     overthrew it. The heavy mass of marble fell with a thundering crash, breaking asunder the flag
     beneath it. It might be the reverberation of the vaulted roof, but a deep groan seemed to
     reproach the young man for his sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by this warning, Rougemont
     placed the point of the lever between the interstices of the broken stone, and, exerting all
     his strength, speedily raised the fragments, and laid open the grave.</p>
    <p>Within it, in the garb he wore in life, with his white beard streaming to his waist, lay the
     uncoffined body of his ancestor, Cyprian de Rougemont. The corpse had evidently been carefully
     embalmed, and the features were unchanged by decay. Upon the breast, with the hands placed over
     it, lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with brazen clasps. Instantly
     possessing himself of this mysterious-looking volume, Rougemont knelt upon the nearest chest,
     and opened it. But he was disappointed in his expectation. All the pages he examined were
     filled with cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to decipher.</p>
    <p>At length, however, he chanced upon one page the import of which he comprehended, and he
     remained for some time absorbed in its contemplation, while an almost fiendish smile played
     upon his features.</p>
    <p>“Aha!” he exclaimed, closing the volume, “I see now the cause of my extraordinary dream. My
     ancestor’s wondrous power was of infernal origin—the result, in fact, of a compact with the
     Prince of Darkness. But what care I for that? Give me wealth—no matter what source it comes
     from!—ha! ha!”</p>
    <p>And seizing the lever, he broke open the chest beside him. It was filled with bars of silver.
     The next he visited in the same way was full of gold. The third was laden with pearls and
     precious stones; and the rest contained treasure to an incalculable amount. Rougemont gazed at
     them in transports of joy.</p>
    <p>“At length I have my wish,” he cried. “Boundless wealth, and therefore boundless power, is
     mine. I can riot in pleasure—riot in vengeance. As to my soul, I will run the risk of its
     perdition; but it shall go hard if I destroy not that of Auriol. His love of play and his
     passion for Edith Talbot shall be the means by which I will work. But I must not neglect
     another agent which is offered me. That bottle, I have learnt from yon volume, contains an
     infernal potion, which, without destroying life, shatters the brain, and creates maddening
     fancies. It will well serve my purpose; and I thank thee, Satan, for the gift.”</p>

    <head>The Compact</head>
    <p>About two months after this occurrence, and near midnight, a young man was hurrying along
     Pall Mall, with a look of the wildest despair, when his headlong course was suddenly arrested
     by a strong grasp, while a familiar voice sounded in his ear.</p>
    <p>“It is useless to meditate self-destruction, Auriol Darcy,” cried the person who had checked
     him. “If you find life a burden, I can make it tolerable to you.”</p>
    <p>Turning round at the appeal, Auriol beheld a tall man, wrapped in a long black cloak, whose
     sinister features were well known to him.</p>
    <p>“Leave me, Rougemont!” he cried fiercely. “I want no society—above all, not yours. You know
     very well that you have ruined me, and that nothing more is to be got from me. Leave me, I say,
     or I may do you a mischief.”</p>
    <p>“Tut, tut, Auriol, I am your friend!” replied Rougemont. “I purpose to relieve your
     distress.”</p>
    <p>“Will you give me back the money you have won from me?” cried Auriol. “Will you pay my
     inexorable creditors? Will you save me from a prison?”</p>
    <p>“I will do all this, and more,” replied Rougemont. “I will make you one of the richest men in
     London.”</p>
    <p>“Spare your insulting jests, sir,” cried Auriol. “I am in no mood to bear them.”</p>
    <p>“I am not jesting,” rejoined Rougemont. “Come with me, and you shall be convinced of my
     sincerity.”</p>
    <p>Auriol at length assented, and they turned into Saint James’s Square, and paused before a
     magnificent house. Rougemont ascended the steps. Auriol, who had accompanied him almost
     mechanically, gazed at him with astonishment.</p>
    <p>“Do you live here?” he inquired.</p>
    <p>“Ask no questions,” replied Rougemont, knocking at the door, which was instantly opened by a
     hall porter, while other servants in rich liveries appeared at a distance. Rougemont addressed
     a few words in an undertone to them, and they instantly bowed respectfully to Auriol, while the
     foremost of them led the way up a magnificent staircase.</p>
    <p>All this was a mystery to the young man, but he followed his conductor without a word, and
     was presently ushered into a gorgeously-furnished and brilliantly-illuminated apartment.</p>
    <p>The servant then left them; and as soon as he was gone Auriol exclaimed, “Is it to mock me
     that you have brought me hither?”</p>
    <p>“To mock you—no,” replied Rougemont. “I have told you that I mean to make you rich. But you
     look greatly exhausted. A glass of wine will revive you.”</p>
    <p>And as he spoke, he stepped towards a small cabinet, and took from it a curiously-shaped
     bottle and a goblet.</p>
    <p>“Taste this wine—it has been long in our family,” he added, filling the cup.</p>
    <p>“It is a strange, bewildering drink,” cried Auriol, setting down the empty goblet, and
     passing his hand before his eyes.</p>
    <p>“You have taken it upon an empty stomach—that is all,” said Rougemont. “You will be better
     anon.”</p>
    <p>“I feel as if I were going mad,” cried Auriol. “It is some damnable potion you have given
     me.”</p>
    <p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Rougemont. “It reminds you of the elixir you once quaffed—eh?”</p>
    <p>“A truce to this raillery!” cried Auriol angrily. “I have said I am in no mood to bear
     it.”</p>
    <p>“Pshaw! I mean no offence,” rejoined the other, changing his manner. “What think you of this
     house?”</p>
    <p>“That it is magnificent,” replied Auriol, gazing around. “I envy you its possession.”</p>
    <p>“It shall be yours, if you please,” replied Rougemont.</p>
    <p>“Mine! you are mocking me again.”</p>
    <p>“Not in the least. You shall buy it from me, if you please.”</p>
    <p>“At what price?” asked Auriol bitterly.</p>
    <p>“At a price you can easily pay,” replied the other. “Come this way, and we will conclude the
     bargain.”</p>
    <p>Proceeding towards the farther end of the room, they entered a small exquisitely-furnished
     chamber, surrounded with sofas of the most luxurious description. In the midst was a table, on
     which writing materials were placed.</p>
    <p>“It were a fruitless boon to give you this house without the means of living in it,” said
     Rougemont, carefully closing the door. “This pocket-book will furnish you with them.”</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>“Notes to an immense amount!” cried Auriol, opening the pocket-book, and glancing at its
     contents.</p>
    <p>“They are yours, together with the house,” cried Rougemont, “if you will but sign a compact
     with me.”</p>
    <p>“A compact!” cried Auriol, regarding him with a look of undefinable terror. “Who and what are
     you?”</p>
    <p>“Some men would call me the devil!” replied Rougemont carelessly. “But you know me too well
     to suppose that I merit such a designation. I offer you wealth. What more could you
     require?”</p>
    <p>“But upon what terms?” demanded Auriol.</p>
    <p>“The easiest imaginable,” replied the other. “You shall judge for yourself.”</p>
    <p>And as he spoke, he opened a writing-desk upon the table, and took from it a parchment.</p>
    <p>“Sit down,” he added, “and read this.”</p>
    <p>Auriol complied, and as he scanned the writing he became transfixed with fear and
     astonishment, while the pocket-book dropped from his grasp.</p>
    <p>After a while he looked up at Rougemont, who was leaning over his shoulder, and whose
     features were wrinkled with a derisive smile.</p>
    <p>“Then you <hi>are</hi> the Fiend?” he cried.</p>
    <p>“If you will have it so—certainly,” replied the other.</p>
    <p>“You are Satan in the form of the man I once knew,” cried Auriol. “Avaunt! I will have no
     dealings with you.”</p>
    <p>“I thought you wiser than to indulge in such idle fears, Darcy,” rejoined the other.
     “Granting even your silly notion of me to be correct, why need you be alarmed? You are
     immortal.”</p>
    <p>“True,” rejoined Auriol thoughtfully; “but yet——”</p>
    <p>“Pshaw!” rejoined the other, “sign, and have done with the matter.”</p>
    <p>“By this compact I am bound to deliver a victim—a female victim—whenever you shall require
     it,” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Precisely,” replied the other; “you can have no difficulty in fulfilling that
     condition.”</p>
    <p>“But if I fail in doing so, I am doomed——”</p>
    <p>“But you will <hi>not</hi> fail,” interrupted the other, lighting a taper and sealing the
     parchment. “Now sign it.”</p>
    <p>Auriol mechanically took the pen, and gazed fixedly on the document.</p>
    <p>“I shall bring eternal destruction on myself if I sign it,” he muttered.</p>
    <p>“A stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin,” said Rougemont, leaning over his
     shoulder. “Riches and happiness are yours. You will not have such another chance.”</p>
    <p>“Tempter!” cried Auriol, hastily attaching his signature to the paper. But he instantly
     started back aghast at the fiendish laugh that rang in his ears.</p>
    <p>“I repent—give it me back!” he cried, endeavouring to snatch the parchment, which Rougemont
     thrust into his bosom.</p>
    <p>“It is too late!” cried the latter, in a triumphant tone. “You are mine—irredeemably
     mine.”</p>
    <p>“Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, sinking back on the couch.</p>
    <p>“I leave you in possession of your house,” pursued Rougemont; “but I shall return in a week,
     when I shall require my first victim.”</p>
    <p>“Your first victim! oh, Heaven!” exclaimed Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Ay, and my choice falls on Edith Talbot!” replied Rougemont.</p>
    <p>“Edith Talbot!” exclaimed Auriol; “she your victim! Think you I would resign her I love
     better than life to you?”</p>
    <p>“It is because she loves you that I have chosen her,” rejoined Rougemont, with a bitter
     laugh. “And such will ever be the case with you. Seek not to love again, for your passion will
     be fatal to the object of it. When the week has elapsed, I shall require Edith at your hands.
     Till then, farewell!”</p>
    <p>“Stay!” cried Auriol. “I break the bargain with thee, fiend. I will have none of it. I abjure
     thee.”</p>
    <p>And he rushed wildly after Rougemont, who had already gained the larger chamber; but, ere he
     could reach him, the mysterious individual had passed through the outer door, and when Auriol
     emerged upon the gallery, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
    <p>Several servants immediately answered the frantic shouts of the young man, and informed him
     that Mr. Rougemont had quitted the house some moments ago, telling them that their master was
     perfectly satisfied with the arrangements he had made for him.</p>
    <p>“And we hope nothing has occurred to alter your opinion, sir?” said the hall porter.</p>
    <p>“You are sure Mr. Rougemont is gone?” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Oh, quite sure, sir,” cried the hall porter. “I helped him on with his cloak myself. He said
     he should return this day week.”</p>
    <p>“If he comes I will not see him,” cried Auriol sharply; “mind that. Deny me to him; and on no
     account whatever let him enter the house.”</p>
    <p>“Your orders shall be strictly obeyed,” replied the porter, staring with surprise.</p>
    <p>“Now leave me,” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>And as they quitted him, he added, in a tone and with a gesture of the deepest despair, “All
     precautions are useless. I am indeed lost!”</p>

    <head>Chapter 3</head>
    <head>Irresolution</head>
    <p>On returning to the cabinet, where his fatal compact with Rougemont had been signed, Auriol
     perceived the pocket-book lying on the floor near the table, and, taking it up, he was about to
     deposit it in the writing-desk, when an irresistible impulse prompted him once more to examine
     its contents. Unfolding the roll of notes, he counted them, and found they amounted to more
     than a hundred thousand pounds. The sight of so much wealth, and the thought of the pleasure
     and the power it would procure him, gradually dispelled his fears, and arising in a transport
     of delight, he exclaimed—“Yes, yes—all obstacles are now removed! When Mr. Talbot finds I am
     become thus wealthy, he will no longer refuse me his daughter. But I am mad,” he added,
     suddenly checking himself—“worse than mad, to indulge such hopes. If it be indeed the Fiend to
     whom I have sold myself, I have no help from perdition! If it be man, I am scarcely less
     terribly fettered. In either case, I will not remain here longer; nor will I avail myself of
     this accursed money, which has tempted me to my undoing.”</p>
    <p>And, hurling the pocket-book to the farther end of the room, he was about to pass through the
     door, when a mocking laugh arrested him. He looked round with astonishment and dread, but could
     see no one. After a while, he again moved forward, but a voice, which he recognised as that of
     Rougemont, called upon him to stay.</p>
    <p>“It will be in vain to fly,” said the unseen speaker. “You cannot escape me. Whether you
     remain here or not—whether you use the wealth I have given you, or leave it behind you—you
     cannot annul your bargain. With this knowledge, you are at liberty to go. But remember, on the
     seventh night from this I shall require Edith Talbot from you!”</p>
    <p>“Where are you, fiend?” demanded Auriol, gazing around furiously. “Show yourself, that I may
     confront you.”</p>
    <p>A mocking laugh was the only response deigned to this injunction.</p>
    <p>“Give me back the compact,” cried Auriol imploringly. “It was signed in ignorance. I knew not
     the price I was to pay for your assistance. Wealth is of no value to me without Edith.”</p>
    <p>“Without wealth you could not obtain her,” replied the voice. “You are only, therefore, where
     you were. But you will think better of the bargain to-morrow. Meanwhile, I counsel you to place
     the money you have so unwisely cast from you safely under lock and key, and to seek repose. You
     will awaken with very different thoughts in the morning.”</p>
    <p>“How am I to account for my sudden accession of wealth?” inquired Auriol, after a pause.</p>
    <p>“You a gambler, and ask that question!” returned the unseen stranger, with a bitter laugh.
     “But I will make your mind easy on that score. As regards the house, you will find a regular
     conveyance of it within that writing-desk, while the note lying on the table, which bears your
     address, comes from me, and announces the payment of a hundred and twenty thousand pounds to
     you, as a debt of honour. You see I have provided against every difficulty. And now,
     farewell!”</p>
    <p>The voice was then hushed; and though Auriol addressed several other questions to the unseen
     speaker, no answer was returned him.</p>
    <p>After some moments of irresolution, Auriol once more took up the pocket-book, and deposited
     it in the writing-desk, in which he found, as he had been led to expect, a deed conveying the
     house to him. He then opened the note lying upon the table, and found its contents accorded
     with what had just been told him. Placing it with the pocket-book, he locked the writing-desk,
     exclaiming, “It is useless to struggle further—I must yield to fate!”</p>
    <p>This done, he went into the adjoining room, and, casting his eyes about, remarked the antique
     bottle and flagon. The latter was filled to the brim—how or with what, Auriol paused not to
     examine; but seizing the cup with desperation, he placed it to his lips, and emptied it at a
     draught.</p>
    <p>A species of intoxication, but pleasing as that produced by opium, presently succeeded. All
     his fears left him, and in their place the gentlest and most delicious fancies arose.
     Surrendering himself delightedly to their influence, he sank upon a couch, and for some time
     was wrapped in a dreamy elysium, imagining himself wandering with Edith Talbot in a lovely
     garden, redolent of sweets, and vocal with the melody of birds. Their path led through a grove,
     in the midst of which was a fountain; and they were hastening towards its marble brink, when
     all at once Edith uttered a scream, and, starting back, pointed to a large black snake lying
     before her, and upon which she would have trodden the next moment. Auriol sprang forward and
     tried to crush the reptile with his heel; but, avoiding the blow, it coiled around his leg, and
     plunged its venom teeth into his flesh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound roused
     him from his slumber, and looking up, he perceived that a servant was in attendance.</p>
    <p>Bowing obsequiously, the man inquired whether he had occasion for anything.</p>
    <p>“Show me to my bedroom—that is all I require,” replied Auriol, scarcely able to shake off the
     effect of the vision.</p>
    <p>And, getting up, he followed the man, almost mechanically, out of the room.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 4</head>
    <head>Edith Talbot</head>
    <p>It was late when Auriol arose on the following morning. At first, finding himself in a large
     and most luxuriantly-furnished chamber, he was at a loss to conceive how he came there, and it
     was some time before he could fully recall the mysterious events of the previous night. As had
     been foretold, however, by Rougemont, his position did not cause him so much anxiety as
     before.</p>
    <p>After attiring himself, he descended to the lower apartments, in one of which a sumptuous
     breakfast awaited him; and having partaken of it, he took a complete survey of the house, and
     found it larger and more magnificent even than he had supposed it. He next supplied himself
     from the pocket-book with a certain sum, for which he fancied he might have occasion in the
     course of the day, and sallied forth. His first business was to procure a splendid carriage and
     horses, and to order some new and rich habiliments to be made with the utmost expedition.</p>
    <p>He then proceeded towards May Fair, and knocked at the door of a large house at the upper end
     of Curzon Street. His heart beat violently as he was shown into an elegant drawing-room, and
     his trepidation momentarily increased, until the servant reappeared and expressed his regret
     that he had misinformed him in stating that Miss Talbot was at home. Both she and Mr. Talbot,
     he said, had gone out about half-an-hour ago. Auriol looked incredulous, but without making any
     remark, departed. Hurrying home, he wrote a few lines to Mr. Talbot, announcing the sudden and
     extraordinary change in his fortune, and formally demanding the hand of Edith. He was about to
     despatch this letter, when a note was brought him by his servant. It was from Edith. Having
     ascertained his new address from his card, she wrote to assure him of her constant attachment.
     Transported by this proof of her affection, Auriol half devoured the note with kisses, and
     instantly sent off his own letter to her father—merely adding a few words to say that he would
     call for an answer on the morrow. But he had not to wait thus long for a reply. Ere an hour had
     elapsed, Mr. Talbot brought it in person.</p>
    <p>Mr. Talbot was a man of about sixty—tall, thin, and gentlemanlike in deportment, with grey
     hair, and black eyebrows, which lent considerable expression to the orbs beneath them. His
     complexion was a bilious brown, and he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter
     had so captivated Auriol, and which it is to be presumed, therefore, she inherited from her
     mother.</p>
    <p>A thorough man of the world, though not an unamiable person, Mr. Talbot was entirely
     influenced by selfish considerations. He had hitherto looked with an unfavourable eye upon
     Auriol’s attentions to his daughter, from a notion that the connection would be very
     undesirable in a pecuniary point of view; but the magnificence of the house in Saint James’s
     Square, which fully bore out Auriol’s account of his newly-acquired wealth, wrought a complete
     change in his opinions, and he soon gave the young man to understand that he should be
     delighted to have him for a son-in-law. Finding him so favourably disposed, Auriol entreated
     him to let the marriage take place—within three days, if possible.</p>
    <p>Mr. Talbot was greatly grieved that he could not comply with his young friend’s request, but
     he was obliged to start the next morning for Nottingham, and could not possibly return under
     three days.</p>
    <p>“But we can be married before you go?” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Scarcely, I fear,” replied Mr. Talbot, smiling blandly. “You must control your impatience,
     my dear young friend. On the sixth day from this—that is, on Wednesday in next week—we are now
     at Friday—you shall be made happy.”</p>
    <p>The coincidence between this appointment, and the time fixed by Rougemont for the delivery of
     his victim, struck Auriol forcibly. His emotion, however, escaped Mr. Talbot, who soon after
     departed, having engaged his future son-in-law to dine with him at seven o’clock.</p>
    <p>Auriol, it need scarcely be said, was punctual to the hour, or, rather, he anticipated it. He
     found Edith alone in the drawing-room, and seated near the window, which was filled with
     choicest flowers. On seeing him, she uttered an exclamation of joy, and sprang to meet him. The
     young man pressed his lips fervently to the little hand extended to him.</p>
    <p>Edith Talbot was a lovely brunette. Her features were regular, and her eyes, which were
     perfectly splendid, were dark, almond-shaped, and of almost Oriental languor. Her hair, which
     she wore braided over her brow and gathered behind in a massive roll, was black and glossy as a
     raven’s wing. Her cheeks were dimpled, her lips of velvet softness, and her teeth like ranges
     of pearls. Perfect grace accompanied all her movements, and one only wondered that feet so
     small as those she possessed should have the power of sustaining a form which, though
     lightsome, was yet rounded in its proportions.</p>
    <p>“You have heard, dear Edith, that your father has consented to our union?” said Auriol, after
     gazing at her for a few moments in silent admiration.</p>
    <p>Edith murmured an affirmative, and blushed deeply.</p>
    <p>“He has fixed Wednesday next,” pursued Auriol; “but I wish an earlier day could have been
     named. I have a presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed, it will not take place at
     all.”</p>
    <p>“You are full of misgivings, Auriol,” she replied.</p>
    <p>“I confess it,” he said; “and my apprehensions have risen to such a point, that I feel
     disposed to urge you to a private marriage, during your father’s absence.”</p>
    <p>“Oh no, Auriol; much as I love you, I could never consent to such a step,” she cried. “You
     cannot urge me to it. I would not abuse my dear father’s trusting love. I have never deceived
     him, and that is the best assurance I can give you that I shall never deceive you.”</p>
    <p>Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Talbot, who held out both his
     hands to Auriol, and professed the greatest delight to see him. And no doubt he was sincere.
     The dinner passed off most pleasantly, and so did the evening; for the old gentleman was in
     high spirits, and his hilarity was communicated to the young couple. When Auriol and Mr. Talbot
     went up-stairs to tea, they found that Edith’s aunt, Mrs. Maitland, had arrived to take charge
     of her during her father’s absence. This lady had always exhibited a partiality for Auriol, and
     had encouraged his suit to her niece; consequently she was well satisfied with the turn affairs
     had taken. It was near midnight before Auriol could tear himself away; and when he rose to
     depart, Mr. Talbot, who had yawned frequently, but fruitlessly, to give him a hint, told him he
     might depend upon seeing him back on the evening of the third day, and in the meantime he
     committed him to the care of Mrs. Maitland and Edith.</p>
    <p>Three days flew by rapidly and delightfully; and on the evening of the last, just as the
     little party were assembled in the drawing-room, after dinner, Mr. Talbot returned from this
     journey.</p>
    <p>“Well, here I am!” he cried, clasping Edith to his bosom, “without having encountered any
     misadventure. On the contrary, I have completed my business to my entire satisfaction.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, how delighted I am to see you, dear papa!” exclaimed Edith. “Now, Auriol, you can have
     no more apprehensions.”</p>
    <p>“Apprehensions of what?” cried Mr. Talbot.</p>
    <p>“Of some accident befalling you, which might have interfered with our happiness, sir,”
     replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Oh, lovers are full of idle fears!” cried Mr. Talbot. “They are unreasonable beings.
     However, here I am, as I said before, safe and sound. To-morrow we will finish all preliminary
     arrangements, and the day after you shall be made happy—ha! ha!”</p>
    <p>“Do you know, papa, Auriol intends to give a grand ball on our wedding-day, and has invited
     all his acquaintance to it?” remarked Edith.</p>
    <p>“I hope you have not invited Cyprian Rougemont?” said Mr. Talbot, regarding him fixedly.</p>
    <p>“I have not, sir,” replied Auriol, turning pale. “But why do you particularise him?”</p>
    <p>“Because I have heard some things of him not much to his credit,” replied Mr. Talbot.</p>
    <p>“What—what have you heard, sir?” demanded Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Why, one shouldn’t believe all the ill one hears of a man; and, indeed, I <hi>cannot</hi>
     believe all I have heard of Cyprian Rougemont,” replied Mr. Talbot; “but I should be glad if
     you dropped his acquaintance altogether. And now let us change the subject.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Talbot seated himself beside Mrs. Maitland, and began to give her some account of his
     journey, which appeared to have been as pleasant as it had been rapid.</p>
    <p>Unable to shake off the gloom which had stolen over him, Auriol took his leave, promising to
     meet Mr. Talbot at his lawyer’s in Lincoln’s Inn, at noon on the following day. He was there at
     the time appointed, and, to Mr. Talbot’s great delight, and the no small surprise of the
     lawyer, paid over a hundred thousand pounds, to be settled on his future wife.</p>
    <p>“You are a perfect man of honour, Auriol,” said Mr. Talbot, clapping him on the shoulder,
     “and I hope Edith will make you an excellent wife. Indeed, I have no doubt of it.”</p>
    <p>“Nor I,—if I ever possess her,” mentally ejaculated Auriol.</p>
    <p>The morning passed in other preparations. In the evening the lovers met as usual, and
     separated with the full persuasion, on Edith’s part at least, that the next day would make them
     happy. Since the night of the compact, Auriol had neither seen Rougemont, nor heard from him,
     and he neglected no precaution to prevent his intrusion.</p>

    <head>The Seventh Night</head>
    <p>It was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone brightly on Auriol’s gorgeous equipage,
     as he drove to St. George’s, Hanover Square, where he was united to Edith. Thus far all seemed
     auspicious, and he thought he could now bill defiance to fate. With the object of his love
     close beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest ties, it seemed impossible she
     could be snatched from him. Nothing occurred during the morning to give him uneasiness, and he
     gave orders that a carriage and four should be ready an hour before midnight, to convey him and
     his bride to Richmond, where they were to spend their honeymoon.</p>
    <p>Night came, and with it began to arrive the guests who were bidden to the ball. No expense
     had been spared by Auriol to give splendour to his fete. It was in all respects magnificent.
     The amusements of the evening commenced with a concert, which was performed by the first
     singers from the Italian Opera; after which, the ball was opened by Auriol and his lovely
     bride. As soon as the dance was over, Auriol made a sign to an attendant, who instantly
     disappeared.</p>
    <p>“Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me, Edith?” he asked, with a heart swelling
     with rapture.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>“Quite so,” she replied, gazing at him with tenderness; “I long to be alone with you.”</p>
    <p>“Come, then,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>Edith arose, and passing her arm under that of her husband, they quitted the ball-room, but
     in place of descending the principal staircase, they took a more private course. The hall,
     which they were obliged to cross, and which they entered from a side-door, was spacious and
     beautifully proportioned, and adorned with numerous statues on pedestals. The ceiling was
     decorated with fresco paintings, and supported by two stately scagliola pillars. From between
     these, a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper room. As Auriol had foreseen,
     the staircase was thronged with guests ascending to the ball-room, the doors of which being
     open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and gave forth strains of liveliest music. Anxious to
     avoid a newly-arrived party in the hall, Auriol and his bride lingered for a moment near a
     pillar.</p>
    <p>“Ha! who is this?” cried Edith, as a tall man, with a sinister countenance, and habited
     entirely in black, moved from the farther side of the pillar, and planted himself in their
     path, with his back partly towards them.</p>
    <p>A thrill of apprehension passed through Auriol’s frame. He looked up and beheld Rougemont,
     who, glancing over his shoulder, fixed his malignant gaze upon him. Retreat was now
     impossible.</p>
    <p>“You thought to delude me,” said Rougemont, in a deep whisper, audible only to Auriol; “but
     you counted without your host. I am come to claim my victim.”</p>
    <p>“What is the matter with you, that you tremble so, dear Auriol?” cried Edith. “Who is this
     strange person?”</p>
    <p>But her husband returned no answer. Terror had taken away his power of utterance.</p>
    <p>“Your carriage waits for you at the door, madam—all is prepared,” said Rougemont, advancing
     towards her, and taking her hand.</p>
    <p>“You are coming, Auriol?” cried Edith, who scarcely knew whether to draw back or go
     forward.</p>
    <p>“Yes—yes,” cried Auriol, who fancied he saw a means of escape. “This is my friend, Mr.
     Rougemont—go with him.”</p>
    <p>“Mr. Rougemont!” cried Edith. “You told my father he would not be here.”</p>
    <p>“Your husband did not invite me, madam,” said Rougemont, with sarcastic emphasis; “but
     knowing I should be welcome, I came unasked. But let us avoid those persons.”</p>
    <p>In another moment they were at the door. The carriage was there with its four horses, and a
     man-servant, in travelling attire, stood beside the steps. Reassured by the sight, Auriol
     recovered his courage, and suffered Rougemont to throw a cloak over Edith’s shoulders. The next
     moment she tripped up the steps of the carriage, and was ensconced within it. Auriol was about
     to follow her, when he received a violent blow on the chest, which stretched him on the
     pavement. Before he could regain his feet, Rougemont had sprung into the carriage. The steps
     were instantly put up by the man-servant, who mounted the box with the utmost celerity, while
     the postillions, plunging spurs into their horses, dashed off with lightning speed. As the
     carriage turned the corner of King Street, Auriol, who had just arisen, beheld, by the light of
     a lamp, Rougemont’s face at the window of the carriage, charged with an expression of the most
     fiendish triumph.</p>
    <p>“What is the matter?” cried Mr. Talbot, who had approached Auriol, “I came to bid you
     good-bye. Why do I find you here alone? Where is the carriage?—what has become of Edith?”</p>
    <p>“She is in the power of the Fiend, and I have sold her to him,” replied Auriol gloomily.</p>
    <p>“What mean you, wretch?” cried Mr. Talbot, in a voice of distraction. “I heard that Cyprian
     Rougemont was here. Can it be he that has gone off with her?”</p>
    <p>“You have hit the truth,” replied Auriol. “He bought her with the money I gave you. I have
     sold her and myself to perdition!”</p>
    <p>“Horror!” exclaimed the old man, falling backwards.</p>
    <p>“Ay, breathe your last—breathe your last!” cried Auriol wildly. “Would I could yield up my
     life, likewise!”</p>
    <p>And he hurried away, utterly unconscious whither he went.</p>

    <head>Chapter 1</head>
    <head>The Cell</head>
    <p>Mr. Thorneycroft and his companions had scarcely gained a passage in the deserted house,
     which they had entered in the manner described in a previous chapter, when they were alarmed by
     the sudden and furious ringing of a bell overhead. The noise brought them instantly to a halt,
     and each man grasped his arms in expectation of an attack, but the peal ceasing in a few
     moments, and all continuing quiet, they moved on as before, and presently reached a large hall
     with a lofty window over the door, which, being without shutters, afforded light enough to
     reveal the dilapidated condition of the mansion.</p>
    <p>From this hall four side doors opened, apparently communicating with different chambers,
     three of which were cautiously tried by Reeks, but they proved to be fastened. The fourth,
     however, yielded to his touch, and admitted them to a chamber, which seemed to have been
     recently occupied, for a lamp was burning within it. The walls were panelled with dusky oak,
     and hung at the lower end with tapestry, representing the Assyrian monarch Ninus, and his
     captive Zoroaster, King of the Bactrians. The chief furniture consisted of three large
     high-backed and grotesquely-carved arm-chairs, near one of which stood a powerful electrical
     machine. Squares and circles were traced upon the floor, and here and there were scattered cups
     and balls, and other matters apparently belonging to a conjuring apparatus.</p>
    <p>The room might be the retreat of a man of science, or it might be the repository of a
     juggler. But whoever its occupant was, and whatsoever his pursuits, the good things of the
     world were not altogether neglected by him, as was proved by a table spread with viands, and
     furnished with glasses, together with a couple of taper-necked bottles.</p>
    <p>While glancing upwards, Mr. Thorneycroft remarked that just above each chair the ceiling was
     pierced with a round hole, the meaning of which he could not at the time comprehend, though
     after circumstances sufficiently explained it to him.</p>
    <p>“A singular room,” he observed to Reeks, on concluding his survey. “Did you expect to find
     any one here?”</p>
    <p>“I hardly know,” replied the other. “That bell may have given the alarm. But I will soon
     ascertain the point. Remain here till I return.”</p>
    <p>“You are not going to leave us?” rejoined Mr. Thorneycroft uneasily.</p>
    <p>“Only for a moment,” said Reeks. “Keep quiet, and no harm will befall you. Whatever you may
     hear without, do not stir.”</p>
    <p>“What are we likely to hear?” asked Thorneycroft with increasing trepidation.</p>
    <p>“That’s impossible to say,” answered Reeks; “but I warn you not to cry out unnecessarily, as
     such an imprudence would endanger our safety.”</p>
    <p>“You are quite sure you don’t mean to abandon us?” persisted Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“Make yourself easy; I have no such intention,” rejoined Reeks sternly.</p>
    <p>“Oh! ve’ll take care on you, don’t be afeerd, old gent,” said Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Yes, ve’ll take care on you,” added the Tinker and the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“You may depend upon them as upon me, sir,” said Reeks. “Before we explore the subterranean
     apartments, I wish to see whether any one is up-stairs.”</p>
    <p>“Wot’s that you say about subterranean apartments, Mr. Reeks?” interposed Ginger. “Ve ain’t
     a-goin’ below, eh?”</p>
    <p>But without paying any attention to the inquiry, Reeks quitted the room, and closed the door
     carefully after him. He next crossed the hall, and cautiously ascending a staircase at the
     farther end of it, reached the landing-place. Beyond it was a gallery, from which several
     chambers opened.</p>
    <p>Advancing a few paces, he listened intently, and hearing a slight sound in an apartment to
     the right, he stepped softly towards it, and placing his eye to the keyhole, beheld a tall man,
     dressed in black, pacing to and fro with rapid strides, while three other persons, wrapped in
     sable gowns, and disguised with hideous masks, stood silent and motionless at a little distance
     from him. In the tall man he recognised Cyprian Rougemont. Upon a table in the middle of the
     room was laid a large open volume, bound in black vellum. Near it stood a lamp, which served to
     illumine the scene.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, Rougemont stopped, and turning over several leaves of the book, which were covered
     with cabalistic characters, appeared in search of some magic formula. Before he could find it,
     however, a startling interruption occurred. An alarum-bell, fixed against the wall, began to
     ring, and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet flew open, and a large ape (for such it
     seemed to Reeks), clothed in a woollen shirt and drawers, sprang forth, and bounding upon the
     table beside Rougemont, placed its mouth to his ear. The communication thus strangely made
     seemed highly displeasing to Rougemont, who knitted his brows, and delivered some instructions
     in an undertone to the monkey. The animal nodded its head in token of obedience, jumped off the
     table, and bounded back to the cabinet, the doors of which closed as before. Rougemont next
     took up the lamp, with the evident intention of quitting the room, seeing which, Reeks hastily
     retreated to an adjoining chamber, the door of which was fortunately open, and had scarcely
     gained its shelter when the four mysterious personages appeared on the gallery. Reeks heard
     their footsteps descending the staircase, and then, creeping cautiously after them, watched
     them across the hall, and pause before the chamber containing Mr. Thorneycroft and his
     companions. After a moment’s deliberation, Rougemont noiselessly locked the door, took out the
     key, and leaving two of his attendants on guard, returned with the third towards the
     staircase.</p>
    <p>Without tarrying to confront them, Reeks started back, and hurried along the gallery till he
     came to a back staircase, which conducted him, by various descents, to the basement floor,
     where, after traversing one or two vaults, he entered a subterranean passage, arched overhead,
     and having several openings at the sides, apparently communicating with other passages. It was
     lighted at intervals by lamps, which emitted a feeble radiance.</p>
    <p>By the light of one of these, Reeks discovered the door of a cell. It was of iron, and as he
     struck it with his hand, returned a hollow clangour. On repeating the blow, a hoarse voice from
     within cried, “Leave me in peace!”</p>
    <p>“Is it Auriol Darcy who speaks?” demanded Reeks.</p>
    <p>“It is,” replied the prisoner. “Who are you that put the question?”</p>
    <p>“A friend,” replied Reeks.</p>
    <p>“I have no friend here,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“You are mistaken,” rejoined Reeks. “I have come with Mr. Thorneycroft to deliver you.”</p>
    <p>“Mr. Thorneycroft has come too late. He has lost his daughter,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“What has happened to her?” demanded Reeks.</p>
    <p>“She is in the power of the Fiend,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“I know she is detained by Cyprian Rougemont,” said Reeks. “But what has befallen her?”</p>
    <p>“She has become like his other victims—like <hi>my</hi> victims!” cried Auriol
     distractedly.</p>
    <p>“Do not despair,” rejoined Reeks. “She may yet be saved.”</p>
    <p>“Saved! how?” cried Auriol. “All is over.”</p>
    <p>“So it may seem to you,” rejoined Reeks; “but you are the victim of delusion.”</p>
    <p>“Oh that I could think so!” exclaimed Auriol. “But no—I saw her fall into the pit. I beheld
     her veiled figure rise from it. I witnessed her signature to the fatal scroll. There could be
     no illusion in what I then beheld.”</p>
    <p>“Despite all this, you will see her again,” said Reeks.</p>
    <p>“Who are you who give me this promise?” asked Auriol.</p>
    <p>“As I have already declared, a friend,” replied Reeks.</p>
    <p>“Are you human?”</p>
    <p>“As yourself.”</p>
    <p>“Then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of darkness,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“I have no fear of Cyprian Rougemont,” rejoined Reeks, with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“Your voice seems familiar to me,” said Auriol. “Tell me who you are?”</p>
    <p>“You shall know anon,” replied Reeks. “But, hist!—we are interrupted. Some one
     approaches.”</p>
   </div>

    <head>The Enchanted Chairs</head>
    <p>More than ten minutes had elapsed since Reeks’ departure, and Mr. Thorneycroft, who had
     hitherto had some difficulty in repressing his anger, now began to give vent to it in muttered
     threats and complaints. His impatience was shared by the Tinker, who, stepping up to Ginger,
     said—</p>
    <p>“Wot the devil can Mr. Reeks be about? I hope nuffin’ has happened to him.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t mention a certain gent’s name here,” remarked Ginger; “or if you do, treat it vith
     proper respect.”</p>
    <p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed the Tinker impatiently; “I don’t like a man stayin’ avay in this manner.
     It looks suspicious. I wotes ve goes and sees arter him. Ve can leave the old gent to take a
     keviet nap by himself. Don’t disturb yourself, sir. Ve’ll only jist giv’ a look about us, and
     then come back.”</p>
    <p>“Stay where you are, rascal!” cried Thorneycroft angrily. “I won’t be left. Stay where you
     are, I command you!”</p>
    <p>“Vell, ve’ve got a noo captain, I’m a-thinkin’,” said the Tinker, winking at the others.
     “Ve’ve no vish to disobleege you, sir. I’ll only jist peep out into the hall, and see if Mr.
     Reeks is anyvhere thereabouts. Vy, zounds!” he added, as he tried the door, “it’s locked!”</p>
    <p>“What’s locked?” cried Thorneycroft in dismay.</p>
    <p>“The door, to be sure,” replied the Tinker. “Ve’re prisoners.”</p>
    <p>“O Lord, you don’t say so!” cried the iron-merchant in an agony of fright. “What will become
     of us?”</p>
    <p>A roar of laughter from the others converted his terror into fury.</p>
    <p>“I see how it is,” he cried. “You have entrapped me, ruffians. It’s all a trick. You mean to
     murder me. But I’ll sell my life dearly. The first who approaches shall have his brains blown
     out.” And as he spoke, he levelled a pistol at the Tinker’s head.</p>
    <p>“Holloa! wot are you arter, sir?” cried that individual, sheltering his head with his hands.
     “You’re a-labourin’ under a mistake—a complete mistake. If it is a trap, ve’re catched in it as
     vell as yourself.”</p>
    <p>“To be sure ve is,” added the Sandman. “Sit down, and vait a bit. I dessay Mr. Reeks’ll come
     back, and it von’t do no good gettin’ into a passion.”</p>
    <p>“Well, well, I must resign myself, I suppose,” groaned Thorneycroft, sinking into a chair.
     “It’s a terrible situation to be placed in—shut up in a haunted house.”</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in many much vurser sitivations,” observed Ginger, “and I alvays found the best
     vay to get out on ’em wos to take things quietly.”</p>
    <p>“Besides, there’s no help for it,” said the Tinker, seating himself.</p>
    <p>“That remains to be seen,” observed the Sandman, taking the chair opposite Thorneycroft. “If
     Reeks don’t come back soon, I’ll bust open the door.”</p>
    <p>“Plenty o’ time for that,” said Ginger, sauntering towards the table on which the provisions
     were spread; “wot do you say to a mouthful o’ wittles?”</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t touch ’em for the world,” replied the Sandman.</p>
    <p>“Nor I,” added the Tinker; “they may be pisoned.”</p>
    <p>“Pisoned—nonsense!” cried Ginger; “don’t you see some von has been a-takin’ his supper here?
     I’ll jist finish it for him.”</p>
    <p>“Vith all my ‘art,” said the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“Don’t touch it on any account,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft. “I agree with your companions, it
     may be poisoned.”</p>
    <p>“Oh! I ain’t afeerd,” cried Ginger, helping himself to a dish before him. “As good a
     pigeon-pie as ever I tasted. Your health, Mr. Thorneycroft,” he added, filling a goblet from
     one of the bottles. “My service to you, gents. Famous tipple, by Jove!” drawing a long breath
     after the draught, and smacking his lips with amazing satisfaction. “Never tasted sich a glass
     o’ wine in all my born days,” he continued, replenishing the goblet: “I wonder wot it’s
     called?”</p>
    <p>“Prussic acid,” replied Mr. Thorneycroft gruffly.</p>
    <p>“Proossic fiddlestick!” cried Ginger; “more likely Tokay. I shall finish the bottle, and
     never be the vorse for it!”</p>
    <p>“He’s gettin’ svipy,” said the Tinker. “I vonder vether it’s really Tokay?”</p>
    <p>“No such thing,” cried Thorneycroft; “let him alone.”</p>
    <p>“I must taste it,” said the Tinker, unable to resist the temptation. “Here, give us a glass,
     Ginger!”</p>
    <p>“Vith pleasure,” replied Ginger, filling a goblet to the brim, and handing it to him. “You’d
     better be perwailed upon, Sandy.”</p>
    <p>“Vell, I s’pose I must,” replied the Sandman, taking the goblet proffered him.</p>
    <p>“Here’s the beaks’ healths!” cried Ginger. “I gives that toast ‘cos they’re alvays so kind to
     us dog-fanciers.”</p>
    <p>“Dog-fanciers—say, rather, dog-stealers; for that’s the name such vagabonds deserve to be
     known by,” said Mr. Thorneycroft with some asperity.</p>
    <p>“Vell, ve von’t quarrel about names,” replied Ginger, laughing, “but I’ll relate a
     circumstance to you as’ll prove that wotever your opinion of our wocation may be, the beaks
     upholds it.”</p>
    <p>“There can be but one opinion as to your nefarious profession,” said Mr. Thorneycroft, “and
     that is, that it’s as bad as horse-stealing and sheep-stealing, and should be punished as those
     offences are punished.”</p>
    <p>“So I think, sir,” said Ginger, winking at the others; “but to my story, and don’t interrupt
     me, or I can’t get through vith it properly. There’s a gent livin’ not a hundred miles from
     Pall Mall, as the noospapers says, as had a favourite Scotch terrier, not worth more nor
     half-a-crown to any one but hisself, but highly wallerable to him, ‘cos it wos a favourite.
     Vell, the dog is lost. A pal of mine gets hold on it, and the gent soon offers a reward for its
     recovery. This don’t bring it back quite so soon as he expects, ‘cos he don’t offer enough; so
     he goes to an agent, Mr. Simpkins, in the Edger Road, and Mr. Simpkins says to him—says he,
     ‘How are you, sir? I expected you some days ago. You’ve com’d about that ere Scotch terrier.
     You’ve got a wallable greyhound, I understand. A man told me he’d have that afore long.’ Seein’
     the gent stare, Mr. S. adds, ‘Vel, I’ll tell you wot you must give for your dog. The party
     von’t take less than six guineas. He knows it ain’t vorth six shillin’, but it’s a great
     favourite, and has given him a precious sight o’ trouble in gettin’ it.’ ‘Give <hi>him</hi>
     trouble!’ cries the gent angrily—‘and what has it given me? I hope to see the rascal hanged! I
     shall pay no such money.’ ‘Werry vell,’ replies Mr. Simpkins coolly, ‘then your dog’ll be bled
     to death, as the nobleman’s wos, and thrown down a breathless carkis afore your door.’”</p>
    <p>“You don’t mean to say that such a horrid circumstance as that really took place?” cried
     Thorneycroft, who was much interested in the relation.</p>
    <p>“Only t’other day, I assure you,” replied Ginger.</p>
    <p>“I’d shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so, if I caught him!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft
     indignantly.</p>
    <p>“And sarve him right, too,” said Ginger. “I discourages all cruelty to hanimals. But don’t
     interrupt me again. Arter a bit more chafferin’ vith Mr. Simpkins, the gent offers three pound
     for his dog, and then goes avay. Next day he reads a report i’ the <hi>Times</hi> noospaper
     that a man has been taken up for dog-stealin’, and that a lot o’ dogs is shut up in the
     green-yard behind the police-office in Bow Street. So he goes there in search o’ his favourite,
     and sure enough he finds it, but the inspector von’t give it up to him, ‘cos the superintendent
     is out o’ the vay.”</p>
    <p>“Shameful!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“Shameful, indeed, sir,” echoed Ginger, laughing. “Thinkin’ his dog safe enough in the hands
     o’ the police, the gent sleeps soundly that night, but ven he goes back next mornin’ he finds
     it has disappeared. The green-yard has been broken into overnight, and all the dogs stolen from
     it.”</p>
    <p>“Under the noses of the police?” cried Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“Under their werry noses,” replied Ginger. “But now comes the cream o’ the jest. You shall
     hear wot the beak says to him ven the gent craves his assistance. ‘I can’t interfere in the
     matter,’ says he, a-bendin’ of his brows in a majestic manner. ‘Parties don’t ought to come
     here vith complaints of vhich I can’t take notice. This place ain’t an advertisin’ office, and
     I sha’n’t suffer it to be made von. I von’t listen to statements affectin’ the characters of
     absent parties.’ Statements affectin’ <hi>our</hi> characters,—do you tvig that, sir?”</p>
    <p>“I do, indeed,” said Thorneycroft, sighing; “and I am sorry to think such a remark should
     have dropped from the bench.”</p>
    <p>“You’re right to say dropped from it, sir,” laughed Ginger. “I told you the beaks vos our
     best friends; they alvays takes our parts. Ven the gent urges that it was a subject of ser’ous
     importance to all dog-owners, the magistrit angrily interrupts him, sayin’—‘Then let there be a
     meetin’ of dog-owners to discuss their grievances. Don’t come to me. I can’t help you.’ And he
     vouldn’t if he could, ‘cos he’s the dog-fancier’s friend.”</p>
    <p>“It looks like it, I must own,” replied Thorneycroft. “Such reprehensible indifference gives
     encouragement to people of your profession. Government itself is to blame. As all persons who
     keep dogs pay a tax for them, their property ought to be protected.”</p>
    <p>“I’m quite satisfied vith the present state of the law,” said Ginger; “here’s the vorthy
     beak! I’ll drink his health a second time.”</p>
    <p>“Halloa! wot’s that?” cried the Tinker; “I thought I heerd a noise.”</p>
    <p>“So did I,” rejoined the Sandman; “a strange sort o’ rumblin’ sound overhead.”</p>
    <p>“There it goes again!” cried Ginger; “wot an awful din!”</p>
    <p>“Now it’s underneath,” said Mr. Thorneycroft, turning pale, and trembling. “It sounds as if
     some hidden machinery were at work.”</p>
    <p>The noise, which up to this moment had borne an indistinct resemblance to the creaking of
     wheels and pulleys, now increased to a violent clatter, while the house was shaken as if by the
     explosion of a mine beneath it.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the occupants of the chairs received a sharp electrical shock, that
     agitated every limb, and caused Mr. Thorneycroft to let fall his pistol, which went off as it
     reached the ground. At the same time, the Sandman dropped his goblet, and the Tinker
     relinquished his grasp of the cutlass. Before they could recover from the shock, all three were
     caught by stout wooden hooks, which, detaching themselves from the back of the chairs, pinioned
     their arms, while their legs were restrained by fetters, which sprang from the ground and
     clasped round their ankles. Thus fixed, they struggled vainly to get free. The chairs seemed
     nailed to the ground, so that all efforts to move them proved futile.</p>
    <p>But the worst was to come. From the holes in the ceiling already alluded to, descended three
     heavy bell-shaped helmets, fashioned like those worn by divers at the bottom of the sea, and
     having round eyelet-holes of glass. It was evident, from the manner of their descent, that
     these helmets must drop on the heads of the sitters—a conviction that filled them with
     inexpressible terror. They shouted, and swore frightfully; but their vociferations availed them
     nothing. Down came the helmets, and the same moment the monkey, which had been seen by Reeks,
     issued from a cupboard at the top of a cabinet, and grinned and gibbered at them.</p>
    <p>Down came the first helmet, and covered the Tinker to the shoulders. His appearance was at
     once ludicrous and terrible, and his roaring within the casque sounded like the bellowing of a
     baited bull.</p>
    <p>Down came the second helmet, though rather more slowly, and the Sandman was eclipsed in the
     same manner as the Tinker, and roared as loudly.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>In both these instances the helmets had dropped without guidance, but in the case of Mr.
     Thorneycroft, a hand, thrust out of the hole in the ceiling, held the helmet suspended over his
     head, like the sword of Damocles. While the poor iron-merchant momentarily expected the same
     doom as his companions, his attention was attracted towards the monkey, which, clinging with
     one hand to the side of the cabinet, extended the other skinny arm towards him, and
     exclaimed—“Will you swear to go hence if you are spared?”</p>
    <p>“No, I will not,” replied the iron-merchant. He had scarcely spoken, when the helmet fell
     with a jerk, and extinguished him like the others.</p>
    <p>Ginger alone remained. During the whole of this strange scene, he had stood with the bottle
     in hand, transfixed with terror and astonishment, and wholly unable to move or cry out. A
     climax was put to his fright, by the descent of the three chairs, with their occupants, through
     the floor into a vault beneath; and as the helmets were whisked up again to the ceiling, and
     the trap-doors closed upon the chairs, he dropped the bottle, and fell with his face upon the
     table. He was, however, soon roused by a pull at his hair, while a shrill voice called him by
     his name.</p>
    <p>“Who is it?” groaned the dog-fancier.</p>
    <p>“Look up!” cried the speaker, again plucking his hair.</p>
    <p>Ginger complied, and beheld the monkey seated beside him.</p>
    <p>“Vy, it can’t be, sure<hi>ly</hi>,” he cried. “And yet I could almost svear it was Old
     Parr.”</p>
    <p>“You’re near the mark,” replied the other, with a shrill laugh. “It is your venerable
     friend.”</p>
    <p>“Vot the deuce are you doing here, and in this dress, or rayther undress?” inquired Ginger.
     “Ven I see you this mornin’, you wos in the serwice of Mr. Loftus.”</p>
    <p>“I’ve got a new master since then,” replied the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry to hear it,” said Ginger, shaking his head. “You haven’t sold yourself, like
     Doctor Forster—eh?”</p>
    <p>“Faustus, my dear Ginger—not Forster,” corrected Old Parr. “No, no, I’ve made no bargain. And
     to be plain with you, I’ve no desire to remain long in my present master’s service.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t like to ask the question too directly, wenerable,” said Ginger, in a deprecatory
     tone—“but is your master—hem!—is he—hem!—the—the——”</p>
    <p>“The devil, you would say,” supplied Old Parr. “Between ourselves, I’m afraid there’s no
     denying it.”</p>
    <p>“La! wot a horrible idea!” exclaimed Ginger, with a shudder; “it makes the flesh creep on
     one’s bones. Then we’re in your master’s power?”</p>
    <p>“Very like it,” replied Old Parr.</p>
    <p>“And there ain’t no chance o’ deliverance?”</p>
    <p>“None that occurs to me.”</p>
    <p>“O Lord! O Lord!” groaned Ginger; “I’ll repent. I’ll become a reformed character. I’ll never
     steal dogs no more.”</p>
    <p>“In that case, there may be some chance for you,” said Old Parr. “I think I could help you to
     escape. Come with me, and I’ll try and get you out.”</p>
    <p>“But wot is to become of the others?” demanded Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Oh, leave them to their fate,” replied Old Parr.</p>
    <p>“No, that’ll never do,” cried Ginger. “Ve’re all in the same boat, and must row out together
     the best vay ve can. I tell you wot it is, wenerable,” he added, seizing him by the
     throat—“your master may be the devil, but you’re mortal; and if you don’t help me to deliver my
     companions, I’ll squeege your windpipe for you.”</p>
    <p>“That’s not the way to induce me to help you,” said Old Parr, twisting himself like an eel
     out of the other’s gripe. “Now get out, if you can.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t be angry,” cried Ginger, seeing the mistake he had committed, and trying to conciliate
     him; “I only meant to frighten you a bit. Can you tell me if Mr. Auriol Darcy is here?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, he is, and a close prisoner,” replied Old Parr.</p>
    <p>“And the girl—Miss Ebber, wot of her?”</p>
    <p>“I can’t say,” rejoined Old Parr. “I can only speak to the living.”</p>
    <p>“Then she’s dead!” cried Ginger, with a look of horror.</p>
    <p>“That’s a secret,” replied the dwarf mysteriously; “and I’m bound by a terrible oath not to
     disclose it.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll have it out of you notvithstandin’,” muttered Ginger. “I vish you would lend me a knock
     on the head, old feller. I can’t help thinkin’ I’ve got a terrible fit o’ the nightmare.”</p>
    <p>“Let this waken you, then,” said Old Parr, giving him a sound buffet on the ear.</p>
    <p>“Holloa, wenerable! not so hard!” cried Ginger.</p>
    <p>“Ha! ha! ha!” screamed the dwarf. “You know what you’re about now.”</p>
    <p>“Not exactly,” said Ginger. “I vish I wos fairly out o’ this cursed place!”</p>
    <p>“You shouldn’t have ventured into the lion’s den,” said Old Parr, in a taunting tone. “But
     come with me, and perhaps I may be able to do something towards your liberation.”</p>
    <p>So saying, he drew aside the tapestry, and opened a panel behind it, through which he passed,
     and beckoned Ginger to follow him. Taking a pistol from his pocket, the latter complied.</p>

    <head>Chapter 3</head>
    <head>Gerard Paston</head>
    <p>Before the chair, in which Mr. Thorneycroft was fixed, reached the ground, terror had taken
     away his senses. A bottle of salts, placed to his nose, revived him after a time; but he had
     nearly relapsed into insensibility on seeing two strange figures, in hideous masks and sable
     cloaks, standing on either side of him, while at a little distance was a third, who carried a
     strangely-fashioned lantern. He looked round for his companions in misfortune, but, though the
     chairs were there, they were unoccupied.</p>
    <p>The masked attendants paid no attention to the iron-merchant’s cries and entreaties; but as
     soon as they thought him able to move, they touched a spring, which freed his arms and legs
     from their bondage, and raising him, dragged him out of the vault, and along a narrow passage,
     till they came to a large sepulchral-looking chamber, cased with black marble, in the midst of
     which, on a velvet fauteuil of the same hue as the walls, sat Cyprian Rougemont. It was, in
     fact, the chamber where Ebba had been subject to her terrible trial.</p>
    <p>Bewildered with terror, the poor iron-merchant threw himself at the feet of Rougemont, who,
     eyeing him with a look of malignant triumph, cried—</p>
    <p>“You have come to seek your daughter. Behold her!”</p>
    <p>And at the words, the large black curtains at the farther end of the room were suddenly
     withdrawn, and discovered the figure of Ebba Thorneycroft standing at the foot of the marble
     staircase. Her features were as pale as death; her limbs rigid and motionless; but her eyes
     blazed with preternatural light. On beholding her, Mr. Thorneycroft uttered a loud cry, and,
     springing to his feet, would have rushed towards her, but he was held back by the two masked
     attendants, who seized each arm, and detained him by main force.</p>
    <p>“Ebba!” he cried—“Ebba!”</p>
    <p>But she appeared wholly insensible to his cries, and remained in the same attitude, with her
     eyes turned away from him.</p>
    <p>“What ails her?” cried the agonised father. “Ebba! Ebba!”</p>
    <p>“Call louder,” said Rougemont, with a jeering laugh.</p>
    <p>“Do you not know me? do you not hear me?” shrieked Mr. Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>Still the figure remained immovable.</p>
    <p>“I told you you should see her,” replied Rougemont, in a taunting tone; “but she is beyond
     your reach.”</p>
    <p>“Not so, not so!” cried Thorneycroft. “Come to me, Ebba!—come to your father. O Heaven! she
     hears me not! she heeds me not! Her senses are gone.”</p>
    <p>“She is fast bound by a spell,” said Rougemont. “Take a last look of her. You will see her no
     more.”</p>
    <p>And, stretching out his hand, the curtains slowly descended, and shrouded the figure from
     view.</p>
    <p>Thorneycroft groaned aloud.</p>
    <p>“Are you not content?” cried Rougemont. “Will you depart in peace, and swear never to come
     here more? If so, I will liberate you and your companions.”</p>
    <p>“So far from complying with your request, I swear never to rest till I have rescued my child
     from you, accursed being!” cried Thorneycroft energetically.</p>
    <p>“You have sealed your doom, then,” replied Rougemont. “But before you are yourself immured,
     you shall see how Auriol Darcy is circumstanced. Bring him along.”</p>
    <p>And, followed by the attendants, who dragged Mr. Thorneycroft after him, he plunged into an
     opening on the right. A few steps brought him to the entrance of the cell. Touching the heavy
     iron door, it instantly swung open, and disclosed Auriol chained to a stone at the farther
     corner of the narrow chamber.</p>
    <p>Not a word was spoken for some minutes, but the captives regarded each other piteously.</p>
    <p>“Oh, Mr. Thorneycroft,” cried Auriol, at length, “I beseech you forgive me. I have destroyed
     your daughter.”</p>
    <p>“You!” exclaimed the iron-merchant in astonishment.</p>
    <p>“It is true,” said Rougemont.</p>
    <p>“I would have saved her if it had been possible!” cried Auriol. “I warned her that to love me
     would be fatal to her. I told her I was linked to an inexorable destiny, which would involve
     her in its meshes—but in vain.”</p>
    <p>“Oh!” ejaculated Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“You see you ought to blame him, not me,” said Rougemont, with a derisive laugh.</p>
    <p>“I would have given my life, my soul, to preserve her, had it been possible!” cried
     Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Horrors crowd so thick upon me that my brain reels,” cried Thorneycroft. “Merciless wretch!”
     he added, to Rougemont, “fiend—whatever you are, complete your work of ruin by my destruction.
     I have nothing left to tie me to life.”</p>
    <p>“I would have the miserable live,” said Rougemont, with a diabolical laugh. “It is only the
     happy I seek to destroy. But you have to thank your own obstinacy for your present distress.
     Bid a lasting farewell to Auriol. You will see him no more.”</p>
    <p>“Hold!” exclaimed Auriol. “A word before we part.”</p>
    <p>“Ay, hold!” echoed a loud and imperious voice from the depths of the passage.</p>
    <p>“Ha!—who speaks?” demanded Rougemont, a shade passing over his countenance.</p>
    <p>“I, Gerard Paston!” exclaimed Reeks, stepping forward.</p>
    <p>The crape was gone from his brow, and in its place was seen the handsome and resolute
     features of a man of middle life. He held a pistol in either hand.</p>
    <p>“Is it you, Gerard Paston?” cried Auriol, regarding him; “the brother of Clara, my second
     victim!”</p>
    <p>“It is,” replied the other. “Your deliverance is at hand, Auriol.”</p>
    <p>“And you have dared to penetrate here, Gerard?” cried Rougemont, stamping the ground with
     rage. “Recollect, you are bound to me by the same ties as Auriol, and you shall share his
     fate.”</p>
    <p>“I am not to be intimidated by threats,” replied Paston, with a scornful laugh. “You have
     employed your arts too long. Deliver up Auriol and this gentleman at once, or——” And he
     levelled the pistols at him.</p>
    <p>“Fire!” cried Rougemont, drawing himself up to his towering height. “No earthly bullets can
     injure me.”</p>
    <p>“Ve’ll try that!” cried Ginger, coming up at the moment behind Paston.</p>
    <p>And he discharged a pistol, with a deliberate aim, at the breast of Rougemont. The latter
     remained erect, and apparently uninjured.</p>
    <p>“You see how ineffectual your weapons are,” said Rougemont, with a derisive laugh.</p>
    <p>“It must be the devil!” cried Ginger, running off.</p>
    <p>“I will try mine,” said Paston.</p>
    <p>But before he could draw the triggers, the pistols were wrested from his grasp by the two
     attendants, who had quitted Thorneycroft, and stolen upon him unperceived, and who next
     pinioned his arms.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 4</head>
    <head>The Pit</head>
    <p>So bewildered was the poor iron-merchant by the strange and terrible events that had befallen
     him, that, though released by the two masked attendants, who left him, as before related, to
     seize Gerard Paston, he felt utterly incapable of exertion, and would probably have made no
     effort to regain his freedom, if his coat had not been vigorously plucked behind, while a low
     voice urged him to fly. Glancing in the direction of the friendly speaker, he could just
     discern a diminutive object standing within the entrance of a side-passage, and reared up
     against the wall so as to be out of sight of Rougemont and his attendants. It was the monkey—or
     rather Old Parr—who, continuing to tug violently at his coat, at last succeeded in drawing him
     backwards into the passage, and then grasping his hand tightly, hurried him along it. The
     passage was wholly unlighted, but Mr. Thorneycroft could perceive that it was exceedingly
     circuitous, and winded round like a maze.</p>
    <p>“Where are you taking me?” he inquired, attempting to stop.</p>
    <p>“Ask no questions,” rejoined the dwarf, pulling him along. “Do you want to be captured, and
     shut up in a cell for the rest of your life?”</p>
    <p>“Certainly not,” replied Thorneycroft, accelerating his movements; “I hope there’s no chance
     of it.”</p>
    <p>“There’s every chance of it,” rejoined Old Parr. “If you’re taken, you’ll share Auriol’s
     fate.”</p>
    <p>“O Lord! I hope not,” groaned the iron-merchant. “I declare, you frighten me so much that you
     take away all power of movement. I shall drop in a minute.”</p>
    <p>“Come along, I say,” screamed the dwarf. “I hear them close behind us.”</p>
    <p>And as he spoke, shouts, and the noise of rapidly-approaching footsteps, resounded along the
     passage.</p>
    <p>“I can’t stir another step,” gasped the iron-merchant. “I’m completely done. Better yield at
     once.”</p>
    <p>“What, without a struggle?” cried the dwarf tauntingly. “Think of your daughter, and let the
     thought of her nerve your heart. She is lost for ever, if you don’t get out of this accursed
     place.”</p>
    <p>“She is lost for ever as it is,” cried the iron-merchant despairingly.</p>
    <p>“No—she may yet be saved,” rejoined the dwarf. “Come on—come on—they are close behind
     us.”</p>
    <p>And it was evident, from the increased clamour, that their pursuers were upon them.</p>
    <p>Roused by the imminence of the danger, and by the hope of rescuing his daughter, Mr.
     Thorneycroft exerted all his energies, and sprang forward. A little farther on, they were
     stopped by a door. It was closed; and venting his disappointment in a scream, the dwarf
     searched for the handle, but could not find it.</p>
    <p>“We are entrapped—we shall be caught,” he cried, “and then woe to both of us. Fool that I was
     to attempt your preservation. Better I had left you to rot in a dungeon than have incurred
     Rougemont’s displeasure.”</p>
    <p>The iron-merchant replied by a groan.</p>
    <p>“It’s all over with me,” he said. “I give it up—I’ll die here!”</p>
    <p>“No—we are saved,” cried the dwarf, as the light, now flashing strongly upon the door,
     revealed a small iron button within it,—“saved—saved!”</p>
    <p>As he spoke, he pressed against the button, which moved a spring, and the door flew open.
     Just as they passed through it, the two masked attendants came in sight. The dwarf instantly
     shut the door, and finding a bolt on the side next him, shot it into the socket. Scarcely had
     he accomplished this, when the pursuers came up, and dashed themselves against the door; but
     finding it bolted, presently ceased their efforts, and apparently withdrew.</p>
    <p>“They are gone by some other way to intercept us,” cried Old Parr, who had paused for a
     moment to listen; “come on, Mr. Thorneycroft.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll try,” replied the iron-merchant, with a subdued groan, “but I’m completely spent. Oh
     that I ever ventured into this place!”</p>
    <p>“It’s too late to think of that now; besides, you came here to rescue your daughter,”
     rejoined Old Parr. “Take care and keep near me. I wonder where this passage leads to?”</p>
    <p>“Don’t you know?” inquired the iron-merchant.</p>
    <p>“Not in the least,” returned the dwarf. “This is the first time I’ve been here—and it shall
     be the last, if I’m allowed any choice in the matter.”</p>
    <p>“You haven’t told me how you came here at all,” observed Thorneycroft.</p>
    <p>“I hardly know myself,” replied the dwarf; “but I find it more difficult to get out than I
     did to get in. How this passage twists about! I declare we seem to be returning to the point we
     started from.”</p>
    <p>“I think we are turning round ourselves,” cried Thorneycroft, in an agony of fright. “My head
     is going. Oh dear! oh dear!”</p>
    <p>“Why, it does seem very strange, I must say,” remarked the dwarf, coming to a halt. “I could
     almost fancy that the solid stone walls were moving around us.”</p>
    <p>“They <hi>are</hi> moving,” cried Thorneycroft, stretching out his hand. “I feel ’em. Lord
     have mercy upon us, and deliver us from the power of the Evil One!”</p>
    <p>“The place seems on fire,” cried the dwarf. “A thick smoke fills the passage. Don’t you
     perceive it, Mr. Thorneycroft?”</p>
    <p>“Don’t I!—to be sure I do,” cried the iron-merchant, coughing and sneezing. “I feel as if I
     were in a room with a smoky chimney, and no window open. Oh!—oh!—I’m choking!”</p>
    <p>“Don’t mind it,” cried the dwarf, who seemed quite at his ease. “We shall soon be out of the
     smoke.”</p>
    <p>“I can’t stand it,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft; “I shall die. Oh! poah—pish—puff!”</p>
    <p>“Come on, I tell you—you’ll get some fresh air in a minute,” rejoined Old Parr. “Halloa!
     how’s this? No outlet. We’re come to a dead stop.”</p>
    <p>“Dead stop, indeed!” echoed the iron-merchant. “We’ve come to that long ago. But what new
     difficulty has arisen?”</p>
    <p>“Merely that the road’s blocked up by a solid wall—that’s all,” replied Old Parr.</p>
    <p>“Blocked up!” exclaimed Thorneycroft. “Then we’re entombed alive.”</p>
    <p>“<hi>I</hi> am,” said the dwarf, with affected nonchalance. “As to you, you’ve the comfort of
     knowing it’ll soon be over with you. But for me, nothing can harm me.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t be too sure of that,” cried a voice above them.</p>
    <p>“Did you speak, Mr. Thorneycroft?” asked the dwarf.</p>
    <p>“N-o-o—not I,” gasped the iron-merchant. “I’m suffocating—help to drag me out.”</p>
    <p>“Get out if you can,” cried the voice that had just spoken.</p>
    <p>“It’s Rougemont himself,” cried the dwarf in alarm. “Then there’s no escape.”</p>
    <p>“None whatever, rascal,” replied the unseen speaker. “I want you. I have more work for you to
     do.”</p>
    <p>“I won’t leave Mr. Thorneycroft,” cried the dwarf resolutely. “I’ve promised to preserve him,
     and I’ll keep my word.”</p>
    <p>“Fool!” cried the other. “You must obey when I command.”</p>
    <p>And as the words were uttered, a hand was thrust down from above, which, grasping the dwarf
     by the nape of the neck, drew him upwards.</p>
    <p>“Lay hold of me, Mr. Thorneycroft,” screamed Old Parr. “I’m going up again—lay hold of
     me—pull me down.”</p>
    <p>Well-nigh stifled by the thickening and pungent vapour, the poor iron-merchant found
     compliance impossible. Before he could reach the dwarf, the little fellow was carried off. Left
     to himself, Mr. Thorneycroft staggered along the passage, expecting every moment to drop, until
     at length a current of fresh air blew in his face, and enabled him to breathe more freely.
     Somewhat revived, he went on, but with great deliberation, and it was well he did so, for he
     suddenly arrived at the brink of a pit about eight feet in depth, into which, if he had
     approached it incautiously, he must infallibly have stumbled, and in all probability have
     broken his neck. This pit evidently communicated with a lower range of chambers, as was shown
     by a brazen lamp burning under an archway. A ladder was planted at one side, and by this Mr.
     Thorneycroft descended, but scarcely had he set foot on the ground, than he felt himself rudely
     grasped by a man who stepped from under the archway. The next moment, however, he was released,
     while the familiar voice of the Tinker exclaimed—</p>
    <p>“Vy, bless my ‘art, if it ain’t Mister Thorneycroft.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, it’s me, certainly, Mr. Tinker,” replied the iron-merchant. “Who’s that you’ve got with
     you?”</p>
    <p>“Vy, who should it be but the Sandman,” rejoined the other gruffly. “Ve’ve set ourselves free
     at last, and have made some nice diskiveries into the bargin.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, ve’ve found it all out,” added the Tinker.</p>
    <p>“What have you discovered—what have you found out?” cried the iron-merchant breathlessly.
     “Have you found my daughter? Where is she? Take me to her.”</p>
    <p>“Not so fast, old gent, not so fast,” rejoined the Tinker. “Ve ain’t sure as ‘ow ve’ve found
     your darter, but ve’ve catched a peep of a nice young ‘ooman.”</p>
    <p>“Oh! it must be her—no doubt of it,” cried the iron-merchant. “Where is she? Take me to her
     without a moment’s delay.”</p>
    <p>“But ve can’t get to her, I tell ‘ee,” replied the Tinker. “Ve knows the place vere she’s
     a-shut up,—that’s all.”</p>
    <p>“Take me to it,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft eagerly.</p>
    <p>“Vell, if you must go, step this vay, then,” rejoined the Tinker, proceeding towards the
     archway. “Halloa, Sandy, did you shut the door arter you?”</p>
    <p>“Not I,” replied the other; “open it.”</p>
    <p>“Easily said,” rejoined the Tinker, “but not quevite so easily done. Vy, zounds, it’s shut of
     itself and bolted itself on t’other side!”</p>
    <p>“Some one must have followed you,” groaned Thorneycroft. “We’re watched on all sides.”</p>
    <p>“Ay, and from above, too,” cried the Sandman. “Look up there!” he added, in accents of
     alarm.</p>
    <p>“What’s the matter? What new danger is at hand?” inquired the iron-merchant.</p>
    <p>“Look up, I say,” cried the Sandman. “Don’t ye see, Tinker?”</p>
    <p>“Ay, ay, I see,” replied the other. “The roof’s a-comin’ in upon us. Let’s get out o’ this as
     fast as ve can.” And he kicked and pushed against the door, but all his efforts were unavailing
     to burst it open.</p>
    <p>At the same time the Sandman rushed towards the ladder, but before he could mount it all
     egress by that means was cut off. An immense iron cover worked in a groove was pushed by some
     unseen machinery over the top of the pit, and enclosed them in it.</p>

    <head>Chapter 5</head>
    <head>New Perplexities</head>
    <p>For several hours deep sleep, occasioned by some potent medicaments, had bound up the senses
     of Auriol. On awaking, he found himself within a cell, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling of
     which were of solid stone masonry. In the midst of this chamber, and supporting the ponderous
     roof, stood a massive granite pillar, the capital of which was grotesquely ornamented with
     death’s-heads and cross-bones, and against this pillar leaned Auriol, with his left arm chained
     by heavy links of iron to a ring in the adjoining wall. Beside him stood a pitcher of water,
     and near him lay an antique-looking book, bound in black vellum. The dungeon in which he was
     confined was circular in form, with a coved roof, sustained by the pillar before mentioned, and
     was approached by a steep flight of steps rising from a doorway, placed some six feet below the
     level of the chamber, and surmounted by a pointed arch. A stream of light, descending from a
     narrow aperture in the roof, fell upon his wasted and haggard features. His dark-brown hair
     hung about his face in elf-locks, his beard was untrimmed, and a fixed and stony glare like
     that of insanity sat in his eye. He was seated on the ground—neither bench nor stool being
     allowed him—with his hand supporting his chin. His gaze was fixed upon vacancy—if that can he
     called vacancy which to him was filled with vivid images. His garb was not that of modern
     times, but consisted of a doublet and hose of rich material, wrought in the fashion of
     Elizabeth’s days.</p>
    <p>After remaining for some time in this musing attitude, Auriol opened the old tome before him,
     and began to turn over its leaves. It was full of magical disquisitions and mysterious
     characters, and he found inscribed on one of its earlier pages a name which instantly riveted
     his attention. Having vainly sought some explanation of this name in the after contents of the
     book, he laid it aside, and became lost in meditation. His reverie ended, he heaved a deep
     sigh, and turned again to the open volume lying before him, and in doing so his eye rested for
     the first time on his habiliments. On beholding them he started, and held out his arm to
     examine his sleeve more narrowly. Satisfied that he was not deceived, he arose and examined
     himself from head to foot. He found himself, as has been stated, attired in the garb of a
     gentleman of Elizabeth’s time.</p>
    <p>“What can this mean?” he cried. “Have I endured a long and troubled dream, during which I
     have fancied myself living through more than two centuries? O Heaven, that it may be so! Oh
     that the fearful crimes I suppose I have committed have only been enacted in a dream! Oh that
     my victims are imaginary! Oh that Ebba should only prove a lovely phantom of the night! And
     yet, I could almost wish the rest were real—so that she might exist. I cannot bear to think
     that she is nothing more than a vision. But it must be so—I have been dreaming—and what a dream
     it has been!—what strange glimpses it has afforded me into futurity! Methought I lived in the
     reigns of many sovereigns—beheld one of them carried to the block—saw revolutions convulse the
     kingdom—old dynasties shaken down, and new ones spring up. Fashions seem to me to have so
     changed, that I had clean forgotten the old ones; while my fellow-men scarcely appeared the
     same as heretofore. Can I be the same myself? Is this the dress I once wore? Let me seek for
     some proof.”</p>
    <p>And thrusting his hand into his doublet, he drew forth some tablets, and hastily examined
     them. They bore his name, and contained some writing, and he exclaimed aloud with joy, “This is
     proof enough—I have been dreaming all this while.”</p>
    <p>“The scheme works to a miracle,” muttered a personage stationed at the foot of the steps
     springing from the doorway, and who, though concealed from view himself, was watching the
     prisoner with a malignant and exulting gaze.</p>
    <p>“And yet, why am I here?” pursued Auriol, looking around. “Ah! I see how it is,” he added,
     with a shudder; “I have been mad—perhaps am mad still. That will account for the strange
     delusion under which I have laboured.”</p>
    <p>“I will act upon that hint,” muttered the listener.</p>
    <p>“Of what use is memory,” continued Auriol musingly, “if things that are not, seem as if they
     were? If joys and sorrows which we have never endured are stamped upon the brain—if visions of
     scenes, and faces and events which we have never witnessed, never known, haunt us, as if they
     had once been familiar? But I am mad—mad!”</p>
    <p>The listener laughed to himself.</p>
    <p>“How else, if I were not mad, could I have believed that I had swallowed the fabled elixir
     vitæ? And yet, is it a fable? for I am puzzled still. Methinks I am old—old—old—though I feel
     young, and look young. All this is madness. Yet how clear and distinct it seems! I can call to
     mind events in Charles the Second’s time. Ha!—who told me of Charles the Second? How know I
     there was such a king? The reigning sovereign should be James, and yet I fancy it is George the
     Fourth. Oh! I am mad—clean mad!”</p>
    <p>There was another pause, during which the listener indulged in a suppressed fit of
     laughter.</p>
    <p>“Would I could look forth from this dungeon,” pursued Auriol, again breaking silence, “and
     satisfy myself of the truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external world, for I am
     so perplexed in mind, that if I were not distracted already, they would be enough to drive me
     so. What dismal, terrible fancies have possessed me, and weigh upon me still—the compact with
     Rougemont—ha!”</p>
    <p>“Now it comes,” cried the listener.</p>
    <p>“Oh, that I could shake off the conviction that this were not so—that my soul, though heavily
     laden, might still be saved! Oh, that I dared to hope this!”</p>
    <p>“I must interrupt him if he pursues this strain,” said the listener.</p>
    <gap unit="graphic" n="images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0008.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0038.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0053.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0063.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0087.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0095.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0127.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0137.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0144.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0159.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0169.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0178.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0196.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0217.jpg images/auriolorelixirof00ains_0239.jpg"/>
    <p>“Whether my crimes are real or imaginary—whether I snatched the cup of immortality from my
     grandsire’s dying lips—whether I signed a compact with the Fiend, and delivered him a victim on
     each tenth year—I cannot now know; but if it is so, I deeply, bitterly regret them, and would
     expiate my offences by a life of penance.”</p>
    <p>At this moment Rougemont, attired in a dress similar to that of the prisoner, marched up the
     steps, and cried, “What ho, Auriol!—Auriol Darcy!”</p>
    <p>“Who speaks?” demanded Auriol. “Ah! is it you, Fiend?”</p>
    <p>“What, you are still in your old fancies,” rejoined Rougemont. “I thought the draught I gave
     you last night would have amended you.”</p>
    <p>“Tell me who and what I am,” cried Auriol, stupefied with astonishment; “in what age I am
     living; and whether I am in my right mind or not?”</p>
    <p>“For the first, you are called Auriol Darcy,” replied Rougemont; “for the second, you are
     living in the reign of his most Catholic Majesty James I. of England, and Sixth of Scotland;
     and for the third, I trust you will soon recover your reason.”</p>
    <p>“Amazement!” cried Auriol, striking his brow with his clenched hand. “Then I <hi>am</hi>
     mad.”</p>
    <p>“It’s plain your reason is returning, since you are conscious of your condition,” replied
     Rougemont; “but calm yourself, you have been subject to raging frenzies.”</p>
    <p>“And I have been shut up here for safety?” demanded Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Precisely,” observed the other.</p>
    <p>“And you are——”</p>
    <p>“Your keeper,” replied Rougemont.</p>
    <p>“My God! what a brain mine must be!” cried Auriol. “Answer me one question—Is there such a
     person as Ebba Thorneycroft?”</p>
    <p>“You have often raved about her,” replied Rougemont. “But she is a mere creature of the
     imagination.”</p>
    <p>Auriol groaned, and sank against the wall.</p>
    <p>“Since you have become so reasonable, you shall again go forth into the world,” said
     Rougemont; “but the first essay must be made at night, for fear of attracting observation. I
     will come to you again a few hours hence. Farewell for the present.”</p>
    <p>And casting a sinister glance at his captive, he turned upon his heel, descended the steps,
     and quitted the cell.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>Chapter 6</head>
    <head>Doctor Lamb Again</head>
    <p>Night came, and the cell grew profoundly dark. Auriol became impatient for the appearance of
     his keeper, but hour after hour passed and he did not arrive. Worn out, at length, with doubt
     and bewildering speculations, the miserable captive was beset with the desire to put an end to
     his torments by suicide, and he determined to execute his fell purpose without delay. An evil
     chance seemed also to befriend him, for scarcely was the idea formed, than his foot encountered
     something on the ground, the rattling of which attracted his attention, and stooping to take it
     up, he grasped the bare blade of a knife.</p>
    <p>“This will, at all events, solve my doubts,” he cried aloud. “I will sheathe this weapon in
     my heart, and, if I am mortal, my woes will be ended.”</p>
    <p>As he spoke, he placed the point to his breast with the full intent to strike, but before he
     could inflict the slightest wound, his arm was forcibly arrested.</p>
    <p>“Would you destroy yourself, madman?” roared a voice. “I thought your violence was abated,
     and that you might go forth in safety. But I find you are worse than ever.”</p>
    <p>Auriol uttered a groan and let the knife fall to the ground. The new-comer kicked it to a
     distance with his foot.</p>
    <p>“You shall be removed to another chamber,” he pursued, “where you can be more strictly
     watched.”</p>
    <p>“Take me forth—oh! take me forth,” cried Auriol. “It was a mere impulse of desperation, which
     I now repent.”</p>
    <p>“I dare not trust you. You will commit some act of insane fury, for which I myself shall have
     to bear the blame. When I yielded to your entreaties on a former occasion, and took you forth,
     I narrowly prevented you from doing all we met a mischief.”</p>
    <p>“I have no recollection of any such circumstance,” returned Auriol mournfully. “But it may be
     true, nevertheless. And if so, it only proves the lamentable condition to which I am
     reduced—memory and reason gone!”</p>
    <p>“Ay, both gone,” cried the other, with an irrepressible chuckle.</p>
    <p>“Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, starting. “I am not so mad but I recognise in you the Evil Being who
     tempted me. I am not so oblivious as to forget our terrible interviews.”</p>
    <p>“What, you are in your lunes again!” cried Rougemont fiercely. “Nay, then I must call my
     assistants, and bind you.”</p>
    <p>“Let me be—let me be!” implored Auriol, “and I will offend you no more. Whatever thoughts may
     arise within me, I will not give utterance to them. Only take me forth.”</p>
    <p>“I came for that purpose,” said Rougemont; “but I repeat, I dare not. You are not
     sufficiently master of yourself.”</p>
    <p>“Try me,” said Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Well,” rejoined the other, “I will see what I can do to calm you.”</p>
    <p>So saying, he disappeared for a few moments, and then returning with a torch, placed it on
     the ground, and producing a phial, handed it to the captive.</p>
    <p>“Drink!” he said.</p>
    <p>Without a moment’s hesitation Auriol complied.</p>
    <p>“It seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing potion,” he remarked, after emptying the
     phial.</p>
    <p>“You are in no condition to judge,” rejoined the other.</p>
    <p>And he proceeded to unfasten Auriol’s chain.</p>
    <p>“Now then, come with me,” he said, “and do not make any attempt at evasion, or you will rue
     it.”</p>
    <p>Like one in a dream, Auriol followed his conductor down the flight of stone steps leading
     from the dungeon, and along a narrow passage. As he proceeded, he thought he heard stealthy
     footsteps behind him; but he never turned his head, to see whether he was really followed. In
     this way they reached a short steep staircase, and mounting it, entered a vault, in which
     Rougemont paused, and placed the torch he had brought with him upon the floor. Its lurid
     glimmer partially illumined the chamber, and showed that it was built of stone. Rude benches of
     antique form were set about the vault, and motioning Auriol to be seated upon one of them,
     Rougemont sounded a silver whistle. The summons was shortly afterwards answered by the dwarf,
     in whose attire a new change had taken place. He was now clothed in a jerkin of grey serge,
     fashioned like the garments worn by the common people in Elizabeth’s reign, and wore a
     trencher-cap on his head. Auriol watched him as he timidly advanced towards Rougemont, and had
     an indistinct recollection of having seen him before; but could not call to mind how or
     where.</p>
    <p>“Is your master a-bed?” demanded Rougemont.</p>
    <p>“A-bed! Good lack, sir!” exclaimed the dwarf, “little of sleep knows Doctor Lamb. He will
     toil at the furnace till the stars have set.”</p>
    <p>“Doctor Lamb!” repeated Auriol. “Surely I have heard that name before?”</p>
    <p>“Very likely,” replied Rougemont, “for it is the name borne by your nearest kinsman.”</p>
    <p>“How is the poor young gentleman?” asked the dwarf, glancing commiseratingly at Auriol. “My
     master often makes inquiries after his grandson, and grieves that the state of his mind should
     render it necessary to confine him.”</p>
    <p>“His grandson! I—Doctor Lamb’s grandson!” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“In sooth are you, young sir,” returned the dwarf. “Were you in your reason, you would be
     aware that my master’s name is the same as your own—Darcy—Reginald Darcy. He assumes the name
     of Doctor Lamb to delude the multitude. He told you as much yourself, sweet sir, if your poor
     wits would enable you to recollect it.”</p>
    <p>“Am I in a dream, good fellow, tell me that?” cried Auriol, lost in amazement.</p>
    <p>“Alack, no, sir,” replied the dwarf; “to my thinking, you are wide awake. But you know, sir,”
     he added, touching his forehead, “you have been a little wrong here, and your memory and reason
     are not of the clearest.”</p>
    <p>“Where does my grandsire dwell?” asked Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Why here, sir,” replied the dwarf; “and for the matter of locality, the house is situated on
     the south end of London Bridge.”</p>
    <p>“<hi>On</hi> the bridge—did you say <hi>on</hi> the bridge, friend?” cried Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Ay, <hi>on</hi> the bridge—where else should it be? You would not have your grandsire live
     under the river?” rejoined the dwarf; “though, for ought I know, some of these vaults may go
     under it. They are damp enough.”</p>
    <p>Auriol was lost in reflection, and did not observe a sign that passed between the dwarf and
     Rougemont.</p>
    <p>“Will it disturb Doctor Lamb if his grandson goes up to him?” said the latter, after a brief
     pause.</p>
    <p>“My master does not like to be interrupted in his operations, as you know, sir,” replied the
     dwarf, “and seldom suffers any one, except myself, to enter his laboratory; but I will make so
     bold as to introduce Master Auriol, if he desires it.”</p>
    <p>“You will confer the greatest favour on me by doing so,” cried Auriol, rising.</p>
    <p>“Sit down—sit down!” said Rougemont authoritatively. “You cannot go up till the doctor has
     been apprised. Remain here, while Flapdragon and I ascertain his wishes.” So saying, he quitted
     the chamber by a farther outlet with the dwarf.</p>
    <p>During the short time that Auriol was left alone, he found it vain to attempt to settle his
     thoughts, or to convince himself that he was not labouring under some strange delusion.</p>
    <p>He was aroused at length by the dwarf, who returned alone.</p>
    <p>“Your grandsire will see you,” said the mannikin.</p>
    <p>“One word before we go,” cried Auriol, seizing his arm.</p>
    <p>“Saints! how you frighten me!” exclaimed the dwarf. “You must keep composed, or I dare not
     take you to my master.”</p>
    <p>“Pardon me,” replied Auriol; “I meant not to alarm you. Where is the person who brought me
     hither?”</p>
    <p>“What, your keeper?” said the dwarf. “Oh, he is within call. He will come to you anon. Now
     follow me.”</p>
    <p>And taking up the torch, he led the way out of the chamber. Mounting a spiral staircase,
     apparently within a turret, they came to a door, which being opened by Flapdragon, disclosed a
     scene that well-nigh stupefied Auriol.</p>
    <p>It was the laboratory precisely as he had seen it above two centuries ago. The floor was
     strewn with alchemical implements—the table was covered with mystic parchments inscribed with
     cabalistic characters—the furnace stood in the corner—crucibles and cucurbites decorated the
     chimney-board—the sphere and brazen lamp hung from the ceiling—the skeletons grinned from
     behind the chimney-corner—all was there as he had seen it before! There also was Doctor Lamb,
     in his loose gown of sable silk, with a square black cap upon his venerable head, and his snowy
     beard streaming to his girdle.</p>
    <p>The old man’s gaze was fixed upon a crucible placed upon the furnace, and he was occupied in
     working the bellows. He moved his head as Auriol entered the chamber, and the features became
     visible. It was a face never to be forgotten.</p>
    <p>“Come in, grandson,” said the old man kindly. “Come in, and close the door after you. The
     draught affects the furnace—my Athanor, as we adepts term it. So you are better, your keeper
     tells me—much better.”</p>
    <p>“Are you indeed living?” cried Auriol, rushing wildly towards him, and attempting to take his
     hand.</p>
    <p>“Off—off!” cried the old man, drawing back as if alarmed. “You disturb my operations. Keep
     him calm, Flapdragon, or take him hence. He may do me a mischief.”</p>
    <p>“I have no such intention, sir,” said Auriol; “indeed I have not. I only wish to be assured
     that you are my aged relative.”</p>
    <p>“To be sure he is, young sir,” interposed the dwarf. “Why should you doubt it?”</p>
    <p>“O sir,” cried Auriol, throwing himself at the old man’s feet, “pity me if I am mad; but
     offer me some explanation, which may tend to restore me to my senses. My reason seems gone, yet
     I appear capable of receiving impressions from external objects. I see you, and appear to know
     you. I see this chamber—these alchemical implements—that furnace—these different objects—and I
     appear to recognise them. Am I deceived, or is this real?”</p>
    <p>“You are not deceived, my son,” replied the old man. “You have been in this room before, and
     you have seen me before. It would be useless to explain to you now how you have suffered from
     fever, and what visions your delirium has produced. When you are perfectly restored, we will
     talk the matter over.”</p>
    <p>And, as he said this, he began to blow the fire anew, and watched with great apparent
     interest the changing colours of the liquid in the cucurbite placed on the furnace.</p>
    <p>Auriol looked at him earnestly, but could not catch another glance, so intently was the old
     man occupied. At length he ventured to break the silence.</p>
    <p>“I should feel perfectly convinced, if I might look forth from that window,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Convinced of what?” rejoined the old man somewhat sharply.</p>
    <p>“That I am what I seem,” replied Auriol.</p>
    <p>“Look forth, then,” said the old man. “But do not disturb me by idle talk. There is the rosy
     colour in the projection for which I have been so long waiting.”</p>
    <p>Auriol then walked to the window and gazed through the tinted panes. It was very dark, and
     objects could only be imperfectly distinguished. Still he fancied he could detect the gleam of
     the river beneath him, and what seemed a long line of houses on the bridge. He also fancied he
     discerned other buildings, with the high roofs, the gables, and the other architectural
     peculiarities of the structures of Elizabeth’s time. He persuaded himself, also, that he could
     distinguish through the gloom the venerable Gothic pile of Saint Paul’s Cathedral on the other
     side of the water, and, as if to satisfy him that he was right, a deep solemn bell tolled forth
     the hour of two. After a while he returned from the window, and said to his supposed grandsire,
