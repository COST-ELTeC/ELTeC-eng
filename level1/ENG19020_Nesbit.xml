                    <p><hi>CONVENTIONALLY</hi> our life-story ended in a shower of rice at the
                        church door, amid the scent of white flowers, with a flutter of white favors
                        all about us. We left behind us those relatives whose presence had been so
                        little desired by us during our brief courtship, and a high-heeled white
                        satin slipper struck the back of the brougham as we drove off. It was like a
                        parting slap on the shoulder from our old life—the old life which we left so
                        gayly, eager to fulfil the destiny set as the end of our wooing's fairy
                        story, and to “live happy ever after.”</p>
                    <p>And now all that was six months ago; and instead of attending to that
                        destiny, the fairy princess and her unworthy prince were plunged<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7142-005"/> over head and ears in their first quarrel—their
                        first serious quarrel—about the real and earnest things of life; for the
                        other little quarrels about matters of sentiment and the affections really
                        did not count. They were only play and make-believe; still, they had got our
                        hands in, so that when we really differed seriously we both knew exactly how
                        to behave—we had played at quarrels so often. This quarrel was very serious,
                        because it was about my shaving-brush and Chloe's handkerchief-case. There
                        was a cupboard with a window—Chloe called it my dressing-room, and, at
                        first, I humored her pretty fancy about it, and pretended that I could
                        really see to shave in a glass that faced the window, although my shoulders,
                        as I stood, cut off all light. But even then I used really to shave at
                        Chloe's mirror after she had gone down to make the tea and boil the
                        eggs—only I kept my shaving things in the embroidered vestments which my
                        wife's affection provided and her fingers worked, and these lived in the
                        “dressing-room.” But the subterfuge presently seemed unworthy, and I found
                        myself, in the ardor of a truthful nature, leaving my soapy brush on her
                        toilet-table. Chloe called this untidiness, and worse, and urged that I had
                        a dressing-room. Then I put the brush away. This had happened more than
                        once.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7142-006"/>
                    <p>On this memorable morning I had set up the pretty ivory shaving-brush, clean
                        and pleasant with its white crown of lather, among her hair-brushes. Chloe
                        came up just then to ask me whether I would have two or three eggs. Her
                        entrance startled me. I cut myself slightly, but infuriatingly, and knocked
                        the brush down. It fell on Chloe's handkerchief-case—pink satin, painted
                        with rose and cupids, a present. Chloe snatched it up.</p>
                    <p>“You are horrid,” she said. “Why don't you shave in your own
                        dressing-room?”</p>
                    <p>“Whatever does it matter?” said I.</p>
                    <p>“My sachet's ruined,” she said, dabbing at it with her
                        pocket-handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>My chin was still bleeding.</p>
                    <p>“It's no use,” she went on. “I spend all my time trying to keep the house
                        nice, and you're always putting things down on things. You put your hateful
                        fountain-pen down on the new drawn-linen table-centre only yesterday, and
                        it's made a great ink mark. Yes, you did—when you were writing the check for
                        the butcher.”</p>
                    <p>I was ill-advised enough to murmur something about trifles.</p>
                    <p>“But they're not trifles,” said Chloe. “They're just the little things that
                        make all the difference between a home and—”</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7142-007"/>
                    <p>“And?”</p>
                    <p>“And other places. Breakfast will be quite spoiled. You're frightfully late.
                        And I don't think this girl means to stay; she's been quite rude about the
                        haddock already.”</p>
                    <p>Now that I knew what my wife was so cross about, I might, perhaps—but I
                        didn't. My chin was still bleeding.</p>
                    <p>I said, “Please don't wait breakfast for me, and began to brush my hair with
                        a dignified aloofness. Chloe went out, and I own that she banged the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>When I was ready I went down to breakfast. Chloe was reading the
                            paper—<emph>a thing she never does.</emph> She poured out my tea and
                        gave it to me without a glance. Thanking her coldly, I helped myself to
                        haddock and opened my letters.</p>
                    <p>It was with the second letter that the shock came. I read the letter twice.
                        And I looked round our little dining-room—it was about ten feet by nine—and
                        I sighed. For I knew—surely if inexplicably—that the dove of peace which had
                        folded its wings there had spread them on a flight from which it would,
                        perhaps, never return. I had quarrelled with my wife—about a shaving-brush;
                        but that episode had now shrunk to less than nothing in the presence of the
                        new, the wonderful danger that threatened our home.<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7142-008"/> I looked at the neat breakfast-table, bright with
                        our wedding-presents—cruet-stands, butter-dishes, and silver-plated
                        teaspoons. I looked at the row of shelves over the mantel-piece, where the
                        more attractive of our crockery stood displayed; at the corner cupboard,
                        picked up for a song in Great Portland Street, and fitted with a lock
                        inexorably guarding the marmalade, the loaf sugar, the sardines, the bottled
                        beer, and such like costly items. I looked at Chloe, mutinously reading the
                        paper—in a white muslin blouse which had been green, with white flowers on
                        it, when we bought it together in the Lewisham High Street for twopence
                        three farthings the yard, and which to my mind was all the prettier for the
                        theft, by soap and water, of its original hue and design. I looked at the
                        remains of the haddock on the dish, the two eggs in the eggstand—another
                        wedding-present. And again I sighed.</p>
                    <p>Chloe laid down the paper irresolutely and looked towards, but not at,
                        me.</p>
                    <p>I sighed again and stirred my tea. I could see that Chloe was making a heroic
                        resolve to overcome her pride and end the quarrel. She did it.</p>
                    <p>“Are you sorry you were so cross?” she asked, severely.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7142-009"/>
                    <p>“Frightfully sorry.” I spoke from the heart.</p>
                    <p>“Then so am I!” she cried. And suddenly the first quarrel found itself over.
                        Presently we went on with the breakfast. To be more accurate, we began. But
                        my thoughts refused to bury themselves in the beefsteak-pudding which Chloe
                        unfolded as a brilliant dinner prospect, and I sighed once more.</p>
                    <p>“What <emph>is</emph> the matter now? Have you forgotten that you're not
                        cross any more, and you're never going to be again—or—<emph>is</emph> the
                        haddock really like she said?” Chloe asked, making horseshoes in her pretty
                        forehead, as she always does when life presents to her any problem not
                        immediately soluble in a laugh or a joke. “Is it another bill? Never mind!
                        I'll ask them to wait. You'll get the check for that detective story on
                        Monday, if the editor has a thread of conscience left, and I'll go up to
                        town to-morrow and draw the money from old Moses for those last drawings of
                        ‘The Holy Life.’”</p>
                    <p>“It's not a bill, madam,” I said, “and Moses can send his money by post.
                        To-morrow we have another errand. To-day, alas! I must finish my article for
                        the <title>Weekly Wilderness</title>.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you want to drive me to suicide?” she asked. “Give me the letter!”</p>
                    <p>“Allow me,” I said, “the melancholy pleasure<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7142-010"/>
                        of communicating its contents. If you have quite finished your eggs and
                        things you may come and sit on my knee.”</p>
                    <p>She came and perched there.</p>
                    <p>“Don't be a pig, Len,” she said. “I'm not a baby, to have bad news broken to
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>Then I put my arm round her and spoke out roundly.</p>
                    <p>“My dear,” I said, “we are ruined.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len, are we really?” said Chloe, much interested.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” I said, firmly. “Hitherto we've worked for our living and earned it.
                        Now we are degraded from the ranks of the noble army of workers. My uncle
                        James has died, and he has left us a hundred a year and a house. Our
                        independence gone—it's a cruel blow! We'll ride over and see it to-morrow as
                        ever is.”</p>
                    <p>I am not sure that Chloe did not weep for joy. Though as a rule, one knows,
                        that sort of weeping is only done in books. You see, we really had worked so
                        very, very hard. However much in love one may be, one does not like to work
                        ten hours a day. Though two may not grudge it as the price of life together.
                        I wrote, Chloe illustrated—we worked hard—hard—hard, and earned enough to
                        keep body and soul and the two of us together in our microscopic house.<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7142-011"/> “The Bandbox” we called it, but on its
                        gatepost it called itself Ross Villa. And now—a hundred a year, and a
                        house—such a house. It came back to me out of my youth, a monument of
                        comfortable affluence, with vineries and pineries, and pits and frames,
                        clean-shaved lawns and trim orchards, yew avenues, box edgings, stabling and
                        coach-houses and pigsties and henneries. Chloe and I clung together in an
                        ecstasy, till “the girl” came in to clear away breakfast. I never saw
                        anything more dramatic than the way in which she indicated, as she bore out
                        the empty dish, that her opinion of the haddock was not only entirely
                        unaltered, but indeed confirmed, by our having eaten it.</p>
                    <p>My article for the <title>Weekly Wilderness</title> got itself written
                        somehow, but with difficulty, for Chloe, demoralized by our good fortune,
                        interrupted me at every sentence—a thing we have carefully trained each
                        other not to do.</p>
                    <p>“Has it a garden?” she asked, suddenly, stopping in front of me with a
                        compelling wave of her wand, or feather brush. “Are you sure it has a
                        garden?”</p>
                    <p>“More or less,” I said. “Don't chatter, there's an angel.”</p>
                    <p>“And out-houses?” after a pause and an interval of fluffy energy.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7142-012"/>
                    <p>“Of sorts,” I said; “but don't talk, my dearest child. You lost me an epigram
                        then.”</p>
                    <p>“I <emph>am</emph> so sorry—but—since you <emph>are</emph> interrupted—dear,
                        dearer, dearest Len, tell me in six words, what is the Red House like?”</p>
                    <p>“It's not red at all—at least only one wing of it. It's a big yellow
                        house—stands all alone in fields. Has a great alarm-bell and, I believe, a
                        ghost. Now be quiet or I shall slap you. To-morrow we'll see it.”</p>
                    <p>But the interruption ruined a delightful sentence, conceived in a spirit of
                        the most delicate irony, and dealing with the late deplorable action of the
                        London water companies—and again I experienced that premonition of unrest.
                        Never again, I felt certain, should I be able to be sure of a clear
                        morning's work. I made allowances for my wife. I was not, I feel certain,
                        unjust or unreasonable, but I saw that while the house and the money were
                        new topics, she could not be expected to preserve on them the hours of
                        silence which my writing exacted. And by the time the topics were stale, the
                        beautiful habit of letting each other alone during working-hours would have
                        been broken forever. I laid down my fountain-pen to make these reflections.
                        I heard Chloe pulling out drawers and opening cupboards in our room
                        overhead. Yet before I could snatch<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7142-013"/> up my
                        pen she had whirled in and caught me idle.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, you're not doing anything. Then I sha'n't interrupt you if I just ask
                        whether there's a hen-house.”</p>
                    <p>“I don't know,” I said, beginning to write very fast, and not sufficiently
                        grateful, I fear, for her indifference to the money as compared with the
                        house. “Why don't you settle down to your work? This is the beginning of the
                        ruin I foresaw.”</p>
                    <p>“I—I don't think I'll work to-day,” she said, guiltily. “I'm looking over
                        some things. But I won't bother.”</p>
                    <p>But she was back again in less than half an hour with a question about
                        larders burning on her lips, and my article degenerated from the clear,
                        sustained logical argument which it meant to be, to a piece of patch-work—of
                        patch-work ill fitted. I became desperate, and avenged my poor broken
                        article by telling Chloe anything rather than the truth about my uncle's old
                        house. In the end this disingenuousness was paid for to the uttermost. If I
                        had prepared her, if I had had the intelligence to overpaint, even, the
                        charms of that old house—but I was firm, firm to the point of spitefulness.
                        “A yellow brick house, as ugly as a lunatic asylum, standing alone in the
                            fields,<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7142-014"/> bearing an alarm-bell and a
                        ghostly reputation.” This was the most she got out of me.</p>
                    <p>My piece of patch-work got its last stitches put in sooner than I expected. I
                        put it in its envelope, addressed it, and went up to our room.</p>
                    <p>All the wardrobe drawers were pulled out. Chloe was sitting on the floor amid
                        a heap of stuffs—a roll of chintz which her mother had given her for covers
                        to our drawing-room furniture, if ever we had any; some bits of velvet, soft
                        reds and greens, that we had bought together at Liberty's sale; and she was
                        snipping and tearing at a muslin and lace gown—a gown I had always admired.
                        I remember she wore it to breakfast the day after our wedding. I felt as
                        though my tenderest memories were being unpicked, stitch by stitch.</p>
                    <p>“What on earth—” I said. She looked up with a flush of excitement on her
                        little face.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len, look here. Don't you think these velvets would cover some cushions
                        very nicely? And the chintz would make lovely long curtains, and I thought I
                        could get at least four short blinds out of this muslin for the new
                        house.”</p>
                    <p>My blood actually ran cold. I sat down suddenly on the clothes-basket. Chloe
                        was not too preoccupied to tell me not to, for perhaps the twentieth
                        time.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7142-015"/>
                    <p>“You know it won't bear your weight,” she said. “Look here. I shall put the
                        lace like that, and like that, and tie it back with yellow ribbon. I've got
                        a soft sash here.”</p>
                    <p>She got up, scattering muslin and velvet, and began to turn over a corner
                        drawer. I found a trembling tongue.</p>
                    <p>“But, my dear child, we can't <emph>live</emph> in the house.”</p>
                    <p>She dropped a lace scarf and her best ivory prayer-book to look at me.</p>
                    <p>“But why?”</p>
                    <p>“It's too big. We can't afford it.”</p>
                    <p>“But we pay rent for this—and we shouldn't for that.”</p>
                    <p>“It's impossible. Why, of course we must let it. It ought to bring us in a
                        couple of hundred a year.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe's eyes actually filled with tears.</p>
                    <p>“My dear, my dear,” I said, “this is very terrible. Is it possible that after
                        so short a time I find you longing to leave the Bandbox—our own little
                        Bandbox—the pride and joy of our hearts?”</p>
                    <p>She came to me then and asked me not to be so horrid.</p>
                    <p>“Don't tease,” she said, “just when I was so pleased, too! You don't know how
                        I hate the people next door, Len. Oh, fancy having no one next door! I'd
                        live in a barn on those terms.”</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7142-016"/>
                    <p>I talked to her in a thoroughly reasonable way, and she presently promised
                        that she also would be reasonable. She agreed that we must let the house.
                        Also she insisted that as I had finished my work, we should go at once and
                        look at it. I in my turn agreed. It was while I was lacing my boots that she
                        said, sighing:</p>
                    <p>“Well, it <emph>is</emph> hard. But you say it's absolutely hideous—that's
                        one comfort.”</p>
                    <p>Even then I might have put up an arm to ward off the blow fate was aiming at
                        me, but my bootlace was in a hard knot, and I said nothing on any other
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>In the hour when afternoon ends and evening begins, we set out to see the Red
                        House. We rode our bicycles, of course. Poor as we were, we could yet
                        command, on the hire system, machines which, at any rate, in their first
                        youth, might have been the desire of princes. Once we had passed the dusty
                        avenue of little villas (wherein our Bandbox, the corner house, squeezed in
                        between two more portly brethren, is of all the most unworthy), and had done
                        the three miles of respectable semi-detachedness which form on this side of
                        town the outer fringe of London's loathly suburbs, our way lay through green
                        lanes where hawthorns were budding in pink and pearl. And here I received a
                        final note of warning.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7142-017"/>
                    <p>“Oh, Len,” Chloe sighed, reining in her shining steed to gaze wistfully on
                        the trim green of the scattered suburban pleasaunces, “if we could only live
                        out here—away from the washing and the organ-grinders and the people next
                        door! Oh—I know we can't—but I wish we could.”</p>
                    <p>“I wish so, too,” I said, briskly. It was merely a polite acquiescence in her
                        aspiration, but it was noted. I, blind mole, noted nothing. The most
                        explicit warnings pass us by unheeded; it is only after the doom stroke has
                        fallen that we perceive the significance of portents.</p>
                    <p>We climbed the hill and passed through the long, sunny village street,
                        clamorous now with bean-feasters and superior private pleasure parties in
                        wagonettes drawn up in front of the “Spotted Dog” and “The Chequers” and the
                        “Castle Hotel,” for was it not Saturday, and the village but a bare ten
                        miles from Charing Cross? Then came the sharp turn to the left, the
                        delicious downward rush through hawthorn-scented air, the black bar of
                        shadow from the railway bridge, a red cottage, a red wall, tall
                        chestnut-trees, pyramids of green fan-leaves and miraculous-scented
                        flowers—a green gate.</p>
                    <p>“This is it,” I said, and Chloe brought down the brake in that reckless way
                        of hers, and sprang to the ground. The sun-blistered, old, green gate<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7142-018"/> swung long and wide on loud, red, rusty
                        hinges as we led our beasts in. We left them under the biggest of the
                        chestnut-trees, and walked up the wide, moss-grown drive to where the front
                        door, fortified by heavy stone pillars, seemed to defy us, the
                        besiegers.</p>
                    <p>“Is this really <emph>it</emph>?” asked Chloe, in a whisper. And well might
                        she ask. The yellow brick on which in my talk I had laid so much stress was
                        hidden almost—at any rate transformed, transfigured—by a net-work of great
                        leaves and red buds; creepers covered it—all but. And at the side there were
                        jasmine that in July nights would be starry and scented, and wistaria,
                        purple-flowered and yellow-leaved over its thick, gnarled boughs, and ivy;
                        and at the back, where the shaky green veranda is overhung by the perilous
                        charm of the white balcony, Virginia-creepers and climbing roses grew in a
                        thorny maze. The moat was there, girdling the old lawns—where once the
                        Elizabethan manor stood—with a belt of silver, a sad swan and a leaky boat
                        keeping each other company. Yellow laburnums trailed their long hair in the
                        water, and sweet lilac-bushes swayed to look at their pretty plumes
                        reflected in it. To right and left stretched the green tangled mysteries of
                        the overgrown gardens.</p>
                    <p>We stepped back onto the bridge that crosses<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7142-019"/>
                        the moat, and looked up at the tall house. Before the ivy dressed it, it
                        must have been very ugly. I suspect my uncle of having had that ivy clipped
                        to its last leaf every spring; and he must have had the house scraped and
                        “pointed” pretty often. How otherwise account for the yellow brick
                        hideousness that glared at me through the mist of the years lying between me
                        and my childhood?</p>
                    <p>The Red House is square, and very tall, but it has two large, low, long wings
                        ending in four square brick turrets with pointed roofs. We stood and looked
                        at it, and I said,</p>
                    <p>“You see it's much too big for us to live in—”</p>
                    <p>Chloe assented, feverishly: “Oh yes, of course, ever so much. But can't we
                        get in?”</p>
                    <p>We couldn't, because I had forgotten to call at the plumber's in the village
                        for the key.</p>
                    <p>“But I'll go back for it,” I said, “only—I didn't think of it—the shop's sure
                        to be shut. It's Saturday, you know.”</p>
                    <p>“Then we won't waste time,” said Chloe, firmly. “Let's be burglars. Break a
                        pane of glass, and let's get in by a window.”</p>
                    <p>Already she was stooping for a stone.</p>
                    <p>“Well—if you insist. But let's at least find a window without shutters.”</p>
                    <p>We went round the house and round the house,<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7142-020"/>
                        like the snow in the riddle; but every window had its eyelids down, as Chloe
                        said.</p>
                    <p>“Stupid, sleepy thing,” she said, “we must wake it up. Can't you climb up to
                        the balcony and get in there?”</p>
                    <p>“Shutters again,” I said. “My worthy uncle believed in them. Now I come to
                        think of it, he had shutters to every window, and a patent fastening for
                        each, and all different. But—”</p>
                    <p>I was looking at the thick, twisted stems of the ivy that clung to the wall
                        of the low left wing.</p>
                    <p>“There used to be an apple-room with a window opening on the leads. In
                        happier days—”</p>
                    <p>“Happier?”</p>
                    <p>“No—earlier! I have climbed up the ivy in my time. But I dare say the
                        apple-room is locked. But I'll go and see, if you insist upon it.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe measured the height with her eyes, some ten feet.</p>
                    <p>“Very well,” she said, meekly. And I went up the ivy. It was as easy as going
                        up a ladder; but I own that as I stepped onto the leads I did not expect to
                        hear my wife's voice just below my feet, saying,</p>
                    <p>“Look out—you'll kick me.”</p>
                    <p>She had climbed up the ivy behind me. I said nothing till I had pulled her up
                        to stand safely beside me, and then I fairly shook her.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7142-021"/>
                    <p>“You wicked,” I said. “Suppose you had slipped? You might have broken that
                        little, silly neck of yours.”</p>
                    <p>She laughed.</p>
                    <p>“My dear boy, I was climbing trees when you were in your cradle!”</p>
                    <p>As I was out of my cradle twenty-two years ago, and that was three years
                        before she was even in hers, this insult called for no reply.</p>
                    <p>“Did you really think I should allow you to see an inch of even the
                        apple-room without me?” she said. “Come on—oh!—how jolly the garden looks
                        from here! Is this the window?”</p>
                    <p>It was. I broke one of the cobwebby panes, and opened the window, but, of
                        course, it was barred.</p>
                    <p>“Idiot that I am—I remember now—I used to creep through. I've grown since
                        then. It's no good. We must give it up.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe was looking at the bars. Suddenly she took her hat off.</p>
                    <p>“I'm not so very big,” she said. “You called me a shrimp only yesterday.”</p>
                    <p>The bottom of the window was level with the leads. She twisted her skirt
                        round her ankles as she sat down, and pushed both feet between the bars.</p>
                    <p>“You can hold on to my arm if you like till I feel the floor. Oh, don't be
                        silly. I <emph>must</emph>.”</p>
                    <pb xml:id="VAB7142-022"/>
                    <p> </p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7142-023"/>
                    <p>She twisted herself like an eel through the bars.</p>
                    <p>“Right. Let go,” and the next moment she was laughing at me out of the dark
                        window.</p>
                    <p>“Mind the stairs,” I said.—“Open the door at the top, and I can come in,
                        too.”</p>
                    <p>She disappeared. The little door shook to her withdrawal of the rust-locked
                        bolts. I bent my head and stepped in. A kiss met my face in the dark.</p>
                    <p>“Welcome to your house,” she said.</p>
                    <p>We went down the little, dark, rickety staircase. At the bottom was a door.
                        Locked.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, this is too much!” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“Go back a few steps,” I said, for my blood was up now, and, besides, the
                        door did not feel very firm.</p>
                    <p>“Broad shoulders <emph>are</emph> useful sometimes,” she said, when the door
                        had given way to the pressure of mine, and we found ourselves standing in
                        the great, dark kitchen, where the thin, dusty shafts of yellow sunlight
                        shot through the shuttercracks.</p>
                    <p>We had down those shutters, and looked out through the dingy windows on the
                        moat.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len, what a place!” she said, and kissed me again. “Just look at the
                        roasting-jack, and the rack for guns, and the hooks in the roof to<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7142-024"/> hang hams and things—and, oh—there's a great
                        bacon-rack. It is <emph>too</emph> beautiful!”</p>
                    <p>We explored the pantry and the servants' hall, the little bedrooms above, and
                        then along the flagged passage to the great hall, tiled with white and red
                        marble, with the oak staircase winding up out of it.</p>
                    <p>We explored the living-rooms that led from it, and before we had climbed the
                        first flight of stairs to the great drawing-room, my wife was breathless
                        with enthusiasm. She kissed me in every room—“for luck,” as she
                        explained—and when at last even the great attics held nothing concealed from
                        us, I calculated that I had received twenty-nine kisses.</p>
                    <p>“It ought to let for a good bit,” I said, thoughtfully, when at last I had
                        replaced all the shutters, and had persuaded her to come out and let me bang
                        the big door after us.</p>
                    <p>“It'll want some doing up, won't it?” said Chloe. “That's a very dangerous
                        hole in the staircase. Come, let's go round the garden.”</p>
                    <p>We went. The old garden had always been beautiful to me, even in the days
                        when I used secretly to eat gooseberries there, and plums, and peaches in an
                        unripe state; and it was beautiful now, even as I remembered it, only now
                        its trees and bushes were incredibly grown—moss-<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7142-025"/> cushioned its paths. Its fountains were dry and
                        weed grown, and its sun-dial was covered with briony and woody nightshade. I
                        put aside the green trails to show Chloe the motto, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Horas numero nisi serenas</foreign> (“I chronicle only the sunny
                        hours”).</p>
                    <p>She leaned her elbows on the top of the sundial, and looked at me.</p>
                    <p>“There now, you see,” she said. “We <emph>must</emph> live here! We simply
                        must. Only sunny hours!”</p>
                    <p>“My dear, it's madness. We <emph>can't</emph> live here. We can let it for
                        two hundred pounds a year.”</p>
                    <p>“I don't care if we could let it for two thousand,” said she.</p>
                    <p>“And our furniture would about fill the servants' hall and the kitchen.”</p>
                    <p>“Then we'll live in the servants' hall and the kitchen.”</p>
                    <p>“And we could never keep up the garden. It would take three men all their
                        time.”</p>
                    <p>“It wouldn't. And I'd get up at three in the morning and weed.”</p>
                    <p>“But you promised to be reasonable.”</p>
                    <p>“I <emph>am</emph>; it's you who aren't; and if I did I don't care. It's what
                        I've wanted all my life. Oh, Len, you <emph>must</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>“If you're so keen on the place we might live<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7142-026"/> in one of the cottages.” There were four on the estate.</p>
                    <p>“I hate the cottages. Poky little things.”</p>
                    <p>“They're bigger than the Bandbox,” I said.</p>
                    <p>“I hate the Bandbox,” she said, mutinously. Then I laughed.</p>
                    <p>“After that heresy,” I said, “I shall take you home. My darling lunatic, come
                        away. The Red House has turned your brain.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe mounted in silence, and in silence we rode away. In the village I
                        stopped at the plumber's—he is also a builder and a house agent, and though
                        it was Saturday, he was, after all, at home—and rather hurriedly told him to
                        try and let the Red House.</p>
                    <p>Chloe said nothing, but stood beside me pale with the strain of her inward
                        protest.</p>
                    <p>We rode on.</p>
                    <p>“How could you?” she said, presently. “When shall we ever have such a chance
                        again? That glorious green garden, and the orchard, all pinky and white, and
                        the drawing-room—it must be forty feet long—and the cottages, and the
                        still-room, and the dear, darling, little apple-room. The whole place is
                        like a picture out of <title>Silas Marner</title>. I'm sure that long, low
                        room where you have to go down two steps was called the white parlor. It's
                        like all the houses I've ever<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7142-027"/> dreamed of.
                        And after I've kissed you in every room for luck, too, and everything! Oh,
                        Len, you don't really love me, or you'd let me live there!”</p>
                    <p>“You certainly put a great strain on my love, madam,” I said, “when you cry
                        for the moon in this disgraceful manner on the king's high-road. Cheer up!
                        Perhaps you'll feel saner in the morning. If not, we'll send for the
                        doctor.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, you'll never let it,” she said, riding faster and faster in her
                        indignation. “That's one comfort! If you do, I shall never believe in
                        anything again. It's the most beautiful place in the world—and it's ours—our
                        very own. You'll see; no one will dare to take it.”</p>
                    <p>What spells she worked I don't know, nor how she worked them. But, curiously
                        enough, no one did take the house. City gentleman after city gentleman
                        approached and retreated after a parley, that always ended in suggestions
                        for repairs to the tune of from four to five hundred pounds. At first each
                        new applicant was to me an object of interest, and to Chloe an object of
                        jealous detestation. But as time wore on, and each new candidate told the
                        same unflattering tale of the shocking state of repairs at the Red House,
                        the hour came when at the accustomed formula I merely smiled. But Chloe
                        laughed, a laugh of triumph and delight.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7142-028"/>
                    <p>We used to ride over there every day to see if the house was let, and it
                        never was; and more and more flowers came out in the garden—old, small sweet
                        tulips and forget-me-nots and hearts-ease, and the roses were in tiny
                        bud.</p>
                    <p>And never for a day did Chloe cease to cry for the moon.</p>
                    <p>The 27th of May is her birthday. It is also the anniversary of the day on
                        which I first met her. So that when, on that day, she held her hand up to
                        look at her new turquoises, and said, “It is a lovely ring, and you're a
                        dear, reckless, extravagant millionaire, and I love you; but oh, Len, I wish
                        you'd give me the Red House instead”—I could hold out no longer.</p>
                    <p>“Very well,” I said, “you shall have the moon, since you won't give up crying
                        for it. But don't blame me if you find it's only green cheese, after
                        all.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, you darling!” she cried. “But I knew all the time you would—if I only
                        kept on—”</p>
                    <p>“This revelation of your methods of government—” I began, with proper
                        severity.</p>
                    <p>But she stopped my mouth quite irresistibly.</p>
                    <p>“Now, don't growl when I'm so happy,” she said. “We shall never have any
                        horrid rent to pay again. We are just being economical, that's all. We can't
                        afford to keep a great house eating<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7142-029"/> ing its
                        head off in the stable; and, anyway, we sha'n't dun ourselves for
                        repairs.”</p>
                    <p>“There will be rates,” I said.</p>
                    <p>“And roses,” said she.</p>
                    <p>“And the expense of moving.”</p>
                    <p>“And the economy of moving.”</p>
                    <p>“And we can't afford a gardener.”</p>
                    <p>“And we don't want one.”</p>
                    <p>“And we've got no furniture.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, we have; a whole Bandbox full.”</p>
                    <p>“And there's a ghost.”</p>
                    <p>“We sha'n't see it—”</p>
                    <p>“And if you do?”</p>
                    <p>“I'll train it to run on errands and clean the windows.”</p>
                    <p>“No servant will stay with us.”</p>
                    <p>“They won't as it is.”</p>
                    <p>“There's a condition,” I said.</p>
                    <p>“Anything on earth,” said she.</p>
                    <p>“If I give you the Red House for a dear little birthday present, I must
                        insist on being allowed to put my shaving-brush down anywhere in it; just
                        anywhere I choose.”</p>
                    <p>“You shall. There's room enough,” she said, but even at that moment she
                        sighed.</p>
                    <p>“When do you wish to move in?”</p>
                    <p>“On your birthday, of course.”</p>
                    <p>And so it was decided. The blow I had dreaded<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7142-030"/> had fallen. My own hands had guided it. On the 6th of June we were to
                        take possession of an immense mansion, standing in its own grounds, replete
                        with every possible inconvenience. Chloe dropped her work and sewed curtains
                        all day. I had never known her so happy. And indeed, now that the die was
                        cast, I myself felt that our new experiment had in it at least all the
                        elements of interest. I owned as much.</p>
                    <p>“Ah,” said Chloe, “I knew you hid a kindly heart under that mask of
                        indifference. Interesting? Oh, my dear boy, you haven't the faintest idea of
                        the interesting things that are going to happen to us at the Red House.”</p>
                    <p>Nor had she. Had either of us even faintly imagined a tenth part of what was
                        to befall us in that house— And yet I don't know. Chloe says now that she
                        would have left the safe shelter of the Bandbox just the same. And I—well,
                        as you see, if Chloe only “keeps all on,” I am foolish enough for
                        anything.</p>

                    <p>“<hi>YOU</hi> look like a historical picture,” Chloe said. “What's-his-name
                        weeping over the ruins of Somewhere or other.”</p>
                    <p>“I <emph>am</emph> weeping, over the ruins of my happy home,” I replied, as I
                        sat on a packing-case and stirred with my boot-toe a tangle of brown paper,
                        string, dust, and empty bottles on the dining-room floor.</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense!” she said. “Your happy home's where <emph>I</emph> am, isn't
                        it?”</p>
                    <p>“That's just what I say. This adorable Bandbox of ours contained my heart's
                        one treasure, and therefore—”</p>
                    <p>“If you mean me,” she said, briskly, “your treasure is not going to be kept
                        in a Bandbox any longer. It is going to live in a palace—”</p>
                    <p>“Unfurnished—replete with—”</p>
                    <p>“Historic associations and other delights,” she interrupted. “And not quite
                        unfurnished, either.<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7142-032"/> Poor, dear boy—was it
                        unhappy at the nasty flitting, then? And was it like a cat, and did it hate
                        to leave its own house? It shall have its paws buttered—its boots, I
                        mean—the minute we get into the new house!”</p>
                    <p>She came and sat beside me on the packing-case, and I absently put my arm
                        round her.</p>
                    <p>“Allow me a moment for natural regrets,” I said. “It is not fair to distract
                        my mind with undue influence when I'm watching the dark waters of time close
                        over the wreck of that good ship, the Bandbox.”</p>
                    <p>“That's fine writing,” she said, contemptuously. “Talk sensibly, there's a
                        good boy.”</p>
                    <p>Acquiescing, I pinched her ears softly. What my wife terms sensible
                        conversation is unworthy to be reported.</p>
                    <p>The Bandbox lay before us, so to speak, in little bits. All the curtains were
                        down, and all the pictures. The crockery was packed up, so were the
                        wedding-presents. The saucepans and kettles sat in a forlorn group on the
                        sitting-room floor. Our comfortable beds were now nothing but rolls of
                        striped ticking and long, iron bands—lying about where one could best trip
                        over them. The wall-papers, which had looked so bright and pleasant with our
                        books and pictures on them, now showed, in patches of aggressively
                            unfaded<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7142-033"/> color, the outlines of the
                        shelves and frames that had hung against them. The fire that had boiled our
                        breakfast-kettle had gone out, and the cold ashes looked inexpressibly
                        desolate.</p>
                    <p>As we sat awaiting the arrival of our green-grocer, who had undertaken to
                        “move” us, I pointed out the ashes to Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“I believe you would like to put some on your head,” said she.</p>
                    <p>The green-grocer had promised to come at nine o'clock. That was why we had
                        got up in the middle of the night, and finished our packing before eight
                        o'clock. It was now past ten.</p>
                    <p>“He has thought better of it,” said I. “He is a far-seeing man, and a kindly.
                        He knows it cannot be for our real good to leave our Bandbox. Let's set to
                        work and put all the things back in their places!”</p>
                    <p>“Here he is,” said Chloe, jumping off the packing-case at the squeaking sound
                        which ever preludes any weak effort on the part of the Bandbox door-knocker.
                        “Oh, Len,” she whispered, in awestruck tones, “it isn't the men! I can see
                        through the door-glass, and it's a <emph>lady</emph>, and look at
                            <emph>me</emph>!”</p>
                    <p>“Life hardly offers a dearer pleasure!” said I, and indeed, in her white gown
                        and blue pinafore, with her brown hair loose and ruffled, she made so pretty
                        a picture that I could not help thinking<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7142-034"/>
                        how a really high-toned green-grocer might well have refused base coin as
                        the price of “moving” us, counting himself well paid by the sight of
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“I'll go, if you like,” I said, and went. Chloe hid herself behind the
                        kitchen door, where the jack-towel used to hang. Even its roller had been
                        unscrewed and packed now.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe!” I called, “it's all right. It's only Yolande.”</p>
                    <p>“Only, indeed!” Miss Riseborough echoed. “Oh, here you are! What on earth's
                        all this? A spring cleaning?”</p>
                    <p>“Yolande?” Chloe cried. “But I thought you were in Italy!”</p>
                    <p>“So I am. At least I was last week, and shall be again next. I've just run
                        over for a few days on business, and I slipped away to the Bandbox to rest
                        my eyes with a look at the turtle-doves. But they don't look restful at
                        all.”</p>
                    <p>She was taking the long, pearl-headed pins out of her hat as she spoke.</p>
                    <p>“Oh!” said my wife, again. “Sit down—no—not on that—it's crocks and
                        newspapers—and the chairs are all packed. Try the packing-case.”</p>
                    <p>But murmuring, “The divan for me!” Yolande sank down on a roll of
                        bedding.</p>
                    <p>“I've yards to tell you, only I thought you<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7142-035"/>
                        were in that horrid Italy, and I've been too busy to write. We're moving
                        into a house with twenty-nine rooms in it.”</p>
                    <p>Then the whole story came out—of Chloe's folly and of my madness. Yolande
                        listened intently, her bright, gray eyes taking in Chloe's transports, and
                        my all too moderate enthusiasm, as well as the devastated state of the
                        Bandbox.</p>
                    <p>“You poor, dear things,” she said. “I wish I wasn't going back to Italy
                        to-morrow. I should like to lend a hand.”</p>
                    <p>“I know you would,” said I, with intent.</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes, but you can't wound me with your sneers. I own I love to have a
                        finger in my neighbors' pies, and the more I love my neighbor, the more I
                        long to infest her house on baking-days. But look here, I wish you'd do me a
                        good turn. If your house is that awful size, you will certainly have a
                        couple of spare rooms in it.”</p>
                    <p>“More like five-and-twenty,” I said.</p>
                    <p>“Well, I've let my flat, unfurnished. Could you, would you, can you, will you
                        be angels enough to take in my poor, homeless furniture, and give it board
                        and lodging and the comforts of a home for a month or two?”</p>
                    <p>Of course we would, gladly, and we said so. And then we talked—always of the
                        Red House.</p>
                    <p>“You'll have a good deal of fun for your money<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7142-036"/> in your new house,” Yolande said, at last, “but, oh, you make me feel as
                        if you were the Babes in the Wood and I were the wicked uncle. I do wish I
                        could stay and help you, but I've three pupils waiting in Florence with
                        their mouths wide open, and a mere temporary chaperon guarding them, and I
                        must scurry back to fill those gaping beaks with fat plums of learning. It's
                        a dreadful trade, a crammer's—almost as bad as the samphire-gatherers'.”</p>
                    <p>“Wish the pie luck, anyhow,” said I, drawing the cork of the ginger-ale,
                        “though you can't have your fingers in it this time. But I dare say there'll
                        be a bit of cold pie left for you when you come back.” So we stood up
                        solemnly and raised our glasses to my toast,</p>
                    <p>“Here's luck to the Red House!”</p>
                    <p>Then said Yolande,</p>
                    <p>“And to the Babes in the Wood!”</p>
                    <p>And to Chloe's toast, “Here's to the wicked uncle—I mean the fairy
                        godmother,” we emptied the glasses.</p>
                    <p>Then Yolande said good-bye, and pinned her hat on to her bright hair. At the
                        door she turned to say:</p>
                    <p>“By-the-way, you won't mind my asking you to keep my things aired, will you?
                        The furniture-warehouse people always let them<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7142-037"/> get mothy, and give the piano a cold in its head.
                        You might hang up the pictures, if you don't mind the trouble; they've all
                        got cords, and they keep better hung up, like meat or game, you know. And
                        furniture keeps best when it's being used. You'll sit on my chairs now and
                        then, for the sake of the absent, won't you? My settle would go awfully well
                        with your gate-table, and my oak press would do in those ‘marble halls’ you
                        were talking about. I must rush, or miss my train. Good-bye. I'll send the
                        furniture down to-morrow.”</p>
                    <p>And she was gone.</p>
                    <p>Chloe turned to me with wide-open, sparkling eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len, isn't she a darling? Just because she saw how our Bandboxful of
                        furniture would rattle about in that big house like a peanut in a cocoanut
                        shell, to lend us all hers! She is a darling.”</p>
                    <p>“She is,” I admitted, “and her hair is the real Venetian red. But you'll miss
                        the furniture horribly when she takes it away.”</p>
                    <p>“Don't grumble,” said Chloe. “We shall have all her lovely things for months
                        and months, and by the time she comes back we shall have made some money to
                        buy things. I'm going to work like a nigger directly we get settled.<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7142-038"/> And so must you. Oh, here are the men at
                        last. Two hours late!”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps it is as well,” I said. “Harriet is only just ready.”</p>
                    <p>Our fat-faced maid-servant, who had rigidly refused during the whole morning
                        to assist us in the least, on the ground that she “had her packing to see
                        to,” now descended the stairs, bearing her whole wardrobe in two brown-paper
                        parcels and a tin hat-box.</p>
                    <p>“Come in, please,” said Chloe, to our remover. “You'd better take these oak
                        boxes first. They're very heavy.”</p>
                    <p>“I wants chesties of drawerses,” said the man, hoarsely, “all the chesties of
                        drawerses you've got, and the pianner. Come on, Bill.”</p>
                    <p>“Right you are, Charley,” was the response.</p>
                    <p>“We haven't a piano, here,” said Chloe, and Charley seemed at once to form
                        the lowest opinion of us. He was a thick-set ruffian with a red and angry
                        eye. He was one of the four helpers engaged by the green-grocer to “move”
                        us. His clothes and those of his friends smelled strange and stuffy, as
                        though they had been smeared with putty and mutton fat, and locked away for
                        years in a cupboard full of pickled onions and yellow soap and mice. The
                        clothes of the unskilled laborer always have this strange<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7142-039"/> scent. It lingers about everything they touch in
                        passing through a house, and after days its freshness is still unimpaired.
                        But I never knew any scent so overpowering as that which clung to the
                        clothes of Charley and his mates. They strayed loudly up the uncarpeted
                        stairs, urgent in their insistence on “chesties of drawerses,” and Chloe
                        would have followed them, but Harriet came forward with, “Please, 'm, could
                        I speak to you for a moment?”</p>
                    <p>“Well?”</p>
                    <p>“Please, I should wish to leave at the end of my month. Mother says the place
                        ain't fit for me. The 'ouse is too large and the work is too 'eavy.”</p>
                    <p>“But we're going into another house,” said Chloe, cheerfully.</p>
                    <p>“Mother don't 'old with movings,” resumed Harriet, “and she says the 'ouse is
                        too large and the work too 'eavy.”</p>
                    <p>“Very well; you can go into the kitchen and wait till we're ready to start,”
                        said Chloe, with dignity.</p>
                    <p>But when the fat-faced traitress had stumped away down the little passage,
                        Chloe dragged me into the dismantled dining-room and flung her arms round my
                        neck. This was not, I knew, affection. It was merely despair.</p>
                    <pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7142-040"/>
                    <p>“She's a pig,” said my wife, with tears in her voice. “Her month's up in a
                        week. She might have told us before. And I'm sure we've been kind to her. I
                        gave her that green moreen petticoat, and some stockings and collars and
                        things, only yesterday. And the petticoat was as good as new.”</p>
                    <p>“I'll have satisfaction for that outrage, at any rate. A moreen petticoat—and
                        green, too!” I cried. “She must be a stranger to all the higher emotions of
                        our fallen nature. Cheer up, my darling, we'll get another girl right
                        enough—a better one.”</p>
                    <p>“We couldn't have a worse,” said she. “Oh, they've broken something. I heard
                        it smash. I do hope it's not the Dresden vases.”</p>
                    <p>It was only our best looking-glass, the same in which I had rebelliously
                        dared to shave. “Never mind,” I said. “They'll have to replace it, and
                        Charley will be unlucky for seven years. That's one comfort.”</p>
                    <p>It was almost our only one. Reckless as a herd of pigs in mid-flight, yet
                        slow as an army of lame snails, Charley and his confederates packed our
                        Bandboxful of furniture into the dark van that smelled of matting and straw
                        and quarter-day. They broke an “occasional” table, and the door of the
                        corner cupboard, and<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7142-041"/> they smashed on the
                        door-step the great jar of pickled walnuts which my mother-in-law had told
                        me would last us a year. But it was Harriet who, sulkily obeying my order to
                        make herself useful, went to the top of the house to fetch two highly
                        colored texts from the walls of her bed-room, and, returning, fell over the
                        best toilet set, smashing the jug and the soap-dish lid! It was rather a
                        nice set, too, dark green, that Yolande had brought from Italy, and, by us,
                        here, totally irreplaceable. I sent Harriet into the back kitchen then.</p>
                    <p>“And don't you come out till we're ready to start,” I said.</p>
                    <p>When the last of our “sticks” had been dragged from the house, and the van
                        had been half unpacked to recover my coat and hat, zealously hidden under
                        the dining-room table in the van's centre, and when the forlorn party of
                        chairs and bookcases had been removed from the pavement and once more
                        envanned, we added Harriet, speechless with sulky displeasure, to the
                        van-load; and as we watched them drive off, my heart, at least, was
                        lighter.</p>
                    <p>We set up our bicycles ready, and blew up the tires. Then we went all over
                        the little house, “to say good-bye to it,” my wife said. Her face was quite
                        sad now. It was in that horrid little<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7142-042"/>
                        dressing-room that she slipped her hand into mine and said:</p>
                    <p>“I didn't think I should be sorry. But I am. Dear little Bandbox—we've been
                        very happy here, haven't we? Oh, do say you think we shall be just as happy
                        there. You do, don't you?”</p>
                    <p>A narrator cannot be expected to chronicle all his replies. My answer
                        satisfied Chloe, anyhow, and she consented to dry her eyes on my
                        handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>Then we took a last look round, and went out.</p>
                    <p>“Good-bye,” we said to our Bandbox, and wished it a happy future.</p>
                    <p>“I hope the next people who live in you will be kind to you,” said Chloe,
                        “and keep you clean, and be very happy in you, poor, dear little house.”</p>
                    <p>We rode away, turning at the corner for one more last look at our Bandbox.
                        Its bare windows blinked forlornly at us in the June sunlight like the eyes
                        of a deserted orphan. We rode on in silence.</p>
                    <p>We passed our furniture about half a mile from the Bandbox. And we had been
                        keeping our tempers for more than two hours in the spacious emptiness of the
                        Red House before the rattle of harness and the scent of Charley's coat
                        announced the arrival of the van.</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7142-043"/>
                    <p>Charley and his minions made a hollow pretence of putting the furniture in
                        its place. They did put the bedsteads together, insecurely, and in the wrong
                        rooms; and they set up “chesties of drawerses” against walls. The oak chests
                        they carried to the attic, and the best steel fire-irons were discovered,
                        weeks later, in the cellar. But almost everything—saucepans, crockery,
                        coal-scuttles, books, hearth-rugs, stair-rods, fenders—was dumped on the
                        floors of the hall, the kitchen, and the dining-room. I remember that I had
                        to move half a ton of mixed valuables to find the tea-kettle, when, after
                        two hours of breathless energy, we heard the van's retreating wheels, and
                        were moved towards the kitchen by one common longing—for tea.</p>
                    <p>Chloe got the tea, and I cleared it away. Harriet reluctantly consented to
                        wash up the tea-things.</p>
                    <p>“But,” she added, and it really was like a blow in the wind, “I must get away
                        before dark. No, it ain't no manner of use talking. There's ghosts in this
                        'ouse, and I wouldn't sleep under this 'ere roof, not for any wages you
                        could offer.”</p>
                    <p>In vain we besought her to reconsider this decision.</p>
                    <p>“Mother always said to me, ‘Don't you never lay your 'ead on your pillow in a
                        'ouse where<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7142-044"/> there's ghosts, or you'll see
                        'em walk—safe as eggs. It runs in our family,’ says she; ‘my mother's second
                        cousin see a calf without a 'ead walkin' on the church-yard wall, as plain
                        as the nose on your face,’ says she. And I can't go agin my own mother, so
                        if it's convenient to you, sir, I'll leave as soon as I've dried the
                        tea-things.”</p>
                    <p>“If it's convenient!” said Chloe. And then we both began to laugh. That saved
                        the situation, besides making Harriet uncomfortable. We let her go, because
                        we could not help it, and we set out our supper—it was tinned salmon and
                        bread—on a sheet of newspaper, because we couldn't find any
                        table-cloths.</p>
                    <p>And we washed our hands with mottled soap, because the brown Windsor soap had
                        hidden itself away somewhere. And we dried them on Chloe's apron, because
                        the towels were mislaid. And we made some cocoa, because the ginger-ale
                        could not, at the moment, be found. It never was found, by-the-way. The
                        search for lamps being fruitless, we walked together to the village in the
                        cool, pale evening, and, returning with a pound of candles in a blue paper,
                        it seemed natural to wander round the shadowy gardens, slowly wrapping
                        themselves in the blue veil of the summer night. The stars came out, one by
                        one, and<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7142-045"/> a little moon that had been like a
                        cloudy ghost through the gold of the afternoon seemed to wash her face with
                        liquid light, and set to work shining in bright earnest. The house seemed
                        very chill, very dark, very silent, as we let ourselves in. The most
                        energetic search and half a box of wax vestas failed to find us a single
                        candlestick. How we regretted, then, the empty bottles left behind at the
                        Bandbox!</p>
                    <p>At last we set up our candles by melting the ends and sticking them in
                        tea-saucers. Then I broke up a packing-case and made a fire in our room. By
                        a fortunate accident, Chloe, looking for her brush and comb, found the
                        blankets. We went round the house and closed all the shutters.</p>
                    <p>“Now,” said Chloe, cheerfully, “we really are at home.”</p>
                    <p>I looked round on the unspeakable confusion—the whole Bandboxful of our
                        effects emptied out, as it were, “tumbled out of a sack” upon the floor, and
                        I said,</p>
                    <p>“Yes.”</p>
                    <p>The birds woke us in the morning; such an orchestra as I had never even
                        imagined. Sleep seemed fled forever. It was I who went down to light the
                        fire for breakfast. It was good to fling back the shutters and
                        window-sashes, and to<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7142-046"/> lean out through the
                        drifted net of green jasmine leaves and taste the fresh sweets of the
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>Presently Chloe came and leaned beside me. The whole world seemed blue and
                        green and gold; the trees and the grass sparkling in the dewy sunshine, and
                        on the bright turf the long, black, tree shadows.</p>
                    <p>“I never saw shadows like these,” Chloe breathed; “they're quite different to
                        the evening ones. And there's no one next door! Oh, it is very good!” The
                        birds sang, the sun shone softly, the swan in the moat spread wide wings,
                        preening his white feathers. A purple haze covered the hills. It was indeed
                        “very good.” The wood began to crackle. I looked at my watch. Five
                        o'clock.</p>
                    <p>“We must always get up at half-past four,” Chloe said. “I had no idea
                        anything could be so beautiful. Think of the poor silly people who only get
                        up at eight.”</p>
                    <p>I thought of them, and I knew that very soon we should once more be numbered
                        among that pitiable band.</p>
                    <p>But I said nothing. We cleared away the breakfast and made our room tidy, and
                        every now and then she would stop to clap her hands—once there were two
                        flat-irons and a duster in them—and to say:</p>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7142-047"/>
                    <p>“Oh, isn't it perfect? Isn't it amusing and interesting and thrilling, and
                        everything anything can possibly be?”</p>
                    <p>We arranged a scheme of disentanglement, and applied it to our goods. Chloe
                        dived into the mass and came up with treasures, which under her directions I
                        bore to the situations she indicated. But many things seemed homeless, and
                        the command, “Oh, I don't know—anywhere—on the kitchen-table,” grew so
                        frequent that the kitchen-table groaned beneath its load, and even the tall
                        dressers showed signs of repletion.</p>
                    <p>But we got one room clear—the white parlor, Chloe called it. It was really
                        half panelled in oak—painted, of course, by some vandal middle-Victorian
                        hand—but still charming, with its carved garlands and flourishes, its high
                        mantelpiece and odd corners. We swept it; we put down our best carpet and
                        hearth-rug; we brought in our oak gate-table and our polished beechwood
                        chairs with the rush seats, and the corner cupboard, and the little
                        bow-legged oak sideboard; we put some green Flemish pots on the
                        mantel-piece. Chloe ran out and came back with half a dozen late tulips, and
                        when she had set them on the table in a jar of Chinese willow-pattern
                        (hand-work, none of your transfers), why, then we had a “room ready,” a
                        refuge, as Chloe said.<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7142-048"/> We also carted the
                        remaining chaos into the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>“Because I give that up,” she said; “we can't get that clear for ages.” So
                        pictures and curtains, and all the things that take time to their fixing,
                        were carried away. And the swept hall looked large and beautiful, especially
                        when we had cleaned the red and white of the marble inlaid floor with a wet
                        broom and a pail of water.</p>
                    <p>As I rubbed the broom vigorously over a discolored square of the marble, I
                        was suddenly conscious of a guilty feeling. Analyzed, the sensation
                        frightened me. I was becoming interested in these details. And I had not
                        once thought about my work, though to-morrow was the day for my article in
                        the <title>Weekly Wilderness</title>. It had never even entered my head to
                        dream that I could ever be interested in cleaning a floor. Yet here I was
                        calling joyously to Chloe, deep in a packing-case in the kitchen:</p>
                    <p>“It's coming the same color as the other.”</p>
                    <p>“It won't be when it's dry,” she said, “but I've found the corkscrew and the
                        lamps. One of them is wrong way up and full of paraffine. At least it was.
                        It's anywhere you like now.”</p>
                    <p>I carried my pail and broom into the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>“My dear,” I said, “have you found my shaving-brush?”</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7142-049"/>
                    <p>“Why?” she asked. “Do you want to put it down on the parlor
                        mantel-piece?”</p>
                    <p>The very thought appalled me, and the fact that it did so appalled me still
                        more deeply.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that a shaving-brush is useful for other purposes than for
                        putting down on things, and presently we found it involved in a pair of lace
                        curtains.</p>
                    <p>We had lunch in the garden.</p>
                    <p>And then Yolande's furniture suddenly loomed at our gates. We had wholly
                        forgotten it. The white parlor had to be reorganized to accommodate her oak
                        settle. The piano we boldly ordered into the drawing-room, where it lived
                        out long days of lonely grandeur. Her furniture was really
                        charming—Chippendale chairs and a Sheraton bureau, pictures by the dozen and
                        lovely crocks by the score. The men who moved her things had linen jackets,
                        and they were not scented like Charley. They actually put things where we
                        wanted them. We stood by in humble amazement. But when they asked where they
                        should hang the pictures, we looked at each other, almost speechless with
                        wonder and gratitude. They hung the pictures, they asked for a broom, and,
                        if ours had not been wet, they would have swept up the dust their careful
                        feet had not been able to help bringing in. They dusted the furniture<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7142-050"/> ture, and asked if there was anything else
                        they could do. I said there was not, and felt in my pocket for silver, far
                        more than I could afford. But Chloe said:</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes! How kind of you! Do please ask every one you know if they know of a
                        servant. We haven't one, and you see—”</p>
                    <p>They saw. They promised all things; they took my silver and went.</p>
                    <p>And that very evening a trim young woman came “about the situation,” accepted
                        it, went off to fetch her box, and never returned. Perhaps she saw the ghost
                        as she went out. We never knew.</p>
                    <p>Next day I sat down with my type-writer in the parlor. Chloe went to London
                        to ransack the registry-offices, so that there was no one to do house-work.
                        Therefore, when I had done my article—it was on “The Pleasures of Home,” I
                        remember—I tidied the place up a little. Happening to find the black-leading
                        apparatus in the bread-pan, I tried my hand at polishing the parlor-grate.
                        It is much less easy than one would suppose, and I barked my knuckles
                        against the bars. Then I cleaned some windows. I knew, from
                            <title>Cranford</title>, that this was done with newspapers. The middles
                        of the panes were easy, the corners inaccessible and irritating. Then I
                            got<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7142-051"/> tea ready and filled the lamps. I
                        experienced all the sensations of an explorer in an unknown and ravishing
                        country. All this was new and extraordinarily fascinating. I chopped wood
                        and filled a box with it, ready for the morning. I also chopped my finger,
                        and decided that I had done enough house-work for the moment. Then I
                        remembered my article. I had forgotten to post it, and the post was gone
                        when I got to the village. I had to walk to Blackheath to catch the late
                        mail—four miles there and back. When I got home Chloe was sitting on the
                        door-step with a perfect stranger.</p>
                    <p>“We've been here <emph>hours</emph>,” she said. “How could you go off like
                        that? This is Ellen—she is coming to live with us.”</p>
                    <p>I could see in Ellen's eye that she was not so sure of this. When Ellen saw
                        the kitchen, with its indescribable complications of domestic matter, she
                        blenched, and I knew the worst. We all turned to, however, and tidied the
                        kitchen superfically, arranged Ellen's bedroom, assisted her to prepare
                        supper, went to bed worn out, and came down in the morning to find Ellen
                        gone. She was not wholly bad; she had some kind impulses. She had lighted
                        the fire and put on the kettle before leaving. But we were a little late
                        that morning, and all the water had boiled<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7142-052"/>
                        away. When I filled the kettle at the tap it cracked, and Chloe said it was
                        always the way, and snatched the kettle out of my hand, and boiled the water
                        for tea in a saucepan that had had cabbage in it. So, after breakfast, I
                        insisted on a turn in the quiet, sunny garden, and she grew calmer.</p>
                    <p>“It is awful, though, isn't it?” she said.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” I owned, “but I black-leaded the parlor-grate yesterday, and I did
                        several other things that you never noticed.”</p>
                    <p>She was stricken with remorse. I followed up my advantage.</p>
                    <p>“And now I'm going to scold us, pussy. It was entirely my fault that we left
                        the Bandbox, but I hope you'll forgive me, and let's make the best of it.
                        And we mustn't take things too seriously. What does it all matter? Through
                        life, my precious pussy-kitten, the best weapon is laughter. Let us agree to
                        laugh at everything, unless we have to cry at it, and if we do cry, to
                        cry—like this.”</p>
                    <p>For she was crying—with her head on my shoulder and my arms round her.</p>
                    <p>“I'm so tired,” she said, presently.</p>
                    <p>“I know you are. Now we're going to sit down on this dear, old stone bench
                        under the red may-tree, and, if you're good, I'll tell you<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7142-053"/> things. We won't try to get a servant again till
                        the kitchen's straight. And we'll shut up all the rooms except the kitchen,
                        and we'll move our bedroom things into one of the down-stairs rooms, so as
                        not to have to use the stairs at all. And the little room that opens out of
                        the kitchen we'll put two tables in, and do our work there—for we must work,
                        you know. And we'll take it in turns to do the house-work, and the other
                        shall work. And when it's all straight we'll get a treasure of a maid, and
                        all live happy ever after! Now you're going to sit here quietly, and I'm
                        going to fetch the <title>Inland Voyage</title>, and read aloud to you for
                        an hour.”</p>
                    <p>We did all these things, and gradually some sort of order evolved itself from
                        chaos, and the scent of Charley's coat faded slowly away.</p>
                    <p>Then we had a rapid succession of unsuitable servants; five, I think, were
                        honest, the sixth went off with all Chloe's lace petticoats and her mink
                        cape.</p>
                    <p>Then we got a woman from the village to come in by the day. She worked fairly
                        well, but she carried a covered basket, and it cost us too much in tea and
                        butter.</p>
                    <p>All this time we had never had a moment for gardening, and Chloe's dream of
                        growing our own vegetables was being swiftly hidden by the<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7142-054"/> weeds of oblivion. There were flowers in plenty,
                        though, now. Hundreds of roses, red and white and yellow. Thousands of pink
                        roses. Canterbury-bells, red daisy-flowers, lupins, columbines, and giant
                        larkspurs. Chloe kept the house a flowery bower. I cleaned the boots and the
                        knives, and whistled at my work. It was when half the neck of mutton got
                        into that covered basket and, ostrich-like, left its tail sticking out, that
                        I told Mrs. Coombe that we must part. She asked for no explanation; I gave
                        none. We parted without unnecessary words. That day it began to rain—a
                        thunder-storm first, then slow, steady, pelting rain for hours and hours. We
                        sat over the kitchen fire that evening and told ghost stories till I saw my
                        wife beginning to cast glances over her shoulder to where the darker shadows
                        lurked in the corners of the great, black-raftered kitchen. Then I lit
                        twelve candles, set then on the mantel-piece, and made port-wine negus, and
                        we drank it and went to bed.</p>
                    <p>In the pitch-dark middle of the night, Chloe caught me by the arm.</p>
                    <p>“You must wake up,” she said, in a terrified whisper; “there's some one in
                        the house—or—or something. I've been awake for hours. Listen! Can't you hear
                        it?”</p>
                    <p>I listened.</p>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7142-055"/>
                    <p>“It's like—Oh, Len, I am so frightened It's a sort of dripping,
                        dripping.”</p>
                    <p>She held me very tight with both hands.</p>
                    <p>“It's like—it's as if some one had been killed and there was blood dripping
                        onto the floor. Oh, listen, and do strike a light! I'm afraid to put my arm
                        out for the matches. It is like blood, dripping! Listen!”</p>
                    <p>I listened.</p>
                    <p>And it was.</p>

                    <head>III</head>
                    <head type="sub">THE GHOST</head>
                    <p><hi>I HAD</hi> held my breath to listen to the drip, drip—loud in itself and
                        hollow in its echo through the grisly silence of the middle night. Now I let
                        my breath go in a sigh.</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> blood, dripping,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>can't</emph> be,” I said; “there's no one in the house to kill any
                        one else—and no one to be killed, either. Don't be a darling idiot.”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps it's some one who was killed long ago!” Her teeth chattered.</p>
                    <p>“A ghost, you mean?” I said, cheerfully. “Not it! I expect some tramp's got
                        in and upset a beer-bottle. Let me get my boots and the poker.”</p>
                    <p>I had always resolved that in no straits would I ever, barefooted, face a
                        burglar. Think of the horrible advantage of hobnailed burglar-boots over
                        shrinking, bare toes.</p>
                    <p>“But there <emph>is</emph> no poker up here,” Chloe said.<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7142-057"/> “You know we never could find the bedroom
                        fire-irons. My umbrella; you know—the one with the purple knob.”</p>
                    <p>One of the ugliest of our wedding presents, the umbrella with the
                        rock-amethyst handle the size of a fives-ball, stood in the wardrobe corner.
                        I balanced it in my hand.</p>
                    <p>“I think it would crack a nut, if need were,” said I—“even the most hardened
                        nut of the most hardened burglar.”</p>
                    <p>“How <emph>can</emph> you?” said Chloe. She was creeping into her
                        dressing-gown. “Now, then—I'll carry the light.”</p>
                    <p>“You're not coming with me?”</p>
                    <p>“Do you think I'm going to stay here <emph>alone</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>“But if it <emph>is</emph> a burglar?”</p>
                    <p>“Exactly—”</p>
                    <p>“You mean you're coming to take care of <emph>me</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don't,” she said—“only I <emph>will</emph> come.”</p>
                    <p>I blew out the candle and took her hand.</p>
                    <p>“If we are to surprise any enterprising professional, we sha'n't do it with a
                        candle,” said I. “Now, then—”</p>
                    <p>We opened the door slowly and softly, and very softly and slowly crept along
                        the dark passage hand in hand.</p>
                    <p>At the stair-foot we stood still and listened.<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7142-058"/> Not a sound but the drip-drip-dripping. It seemed to come from the white
                        parlor.</p>
                    <p>My wife clutched my hand in both hers.</p>
                    <p>“I <emph>can't</emph>,” she whispered, and struck a match. Her hands trembled
                        so that she could hardly light the candle.</p>
                    <p>I took it from her.</p>
                    <p>“You'd better go back,” I said. But we went on.</p>
                    <p>I flung open the door of the white parlor, while Chloe stood with her back to
                        the wall, hiding her face in her hands.</p>
                    <p>I took two steps into the darkness. Then I laughed aloud and put down the
                        candle on the table.</p>
                    <p>“Len, what is it? Oh—what is it?”</p>
                    <p>“It's all right, dear,” I said, “but it's fortunate I brought the
                        umbrella.”</p>
                    <p>I put it up as I spoke, and, catching Chloe's hand, drew her under it. The
                        drops splashed on the umbrella heavily from the ceiling above. Chloe and I
                        looked in each other's eyes and laughed.</p>
                    <p>“Oh dear, how silly! Why, it's only the water coming through the roof!”</p>
                    <p>“Yes—only!” said I. The floor was an inch deep in water, and from the ceiling
                        it was falling, in heavy, capricious showers, on furniture, books, cushions,
                        curtains.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="VAB7142-059"/>
                    <p> </p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7142-060"/>
                    <p>“You're not frightened now?” I asked, shutting the wet umbrella with a
                        flap.</p>
                    <p>“No.”</p>
                    <p>“Then we'd better get dressed and see what can be done.”</p>
                    <p>We dressed hastily and lit the candles in the tall, old brass candlesticks on
                        the white-parlor mantel-piece. It took us some little time to find places,
                        where these could stand without prompt extinguishment from the dripping
                        ceiling.</p>
                    <p>Then, barefooted both, with my trousers tucked up, and Chloe's skirts kilted
                        to the knee, we did our best with pails and mops and house flannels.</p>
                    <p>We carried all our books out into the hall, and stood them up on their edges,
                        with their leaves open, to dry. We carried out our furniture-the settle, and
                        the gate-table, and the rush-bottomed beechwood chairs. We took down the wet
                        curtains and hung them on the bacon-rack in the kitchen. “I do wish we kept
                        a pig,” said Chloe, in parenthesis. “Fancy sides of bacon swinging here,
                        instead of wet, floppy, droppy curtains!” It was a night's work. When the
                        gray of the dawn showed us, through rain-wrinkled window-panes, the green
                        tangle of our garden, all beaten down to one dripping desolation, with a
                        gray sky above, and over all the rain, I looked at my wife and said:</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7142-061"/>
                    <p>“This has been an adventurous night. It is a ghastly morning. Do people who
                        have been up all night have breakfast? Tea, for instance? You are wet as any
                        mermaid, and twice as pretty. But water's not your native element. You must
                        be dried. I'll light a fire.”</p>
                    <p>She had caught at the rope of bright hair that hung below her waist, and was
                        wringing the water out of it. Her bare feet were pink and rosy in the mixed
                        radiance of dawn and candlelight. Her striped red-and-white skirts gave her
                        a sort of coquettish smartness, as of a Parisienne at Trouville. She held
                        out her hand with a dramatic gesture.</p>
                    <p>“Come with your mermaid,” she said; “come and light a fire of driftwood in
                        her ocean cave.”</p>
                    <p>She led me through the kitchen to the little room where we worked. A fire
                        burned red and glowing; on her drawing-table, white damask covered, were
                        bread, butter, tea-things. The brass kettle sang softly on the hob.</p>
                    <p>“The ghost must have done this,” said I. “You said you'd make it run errands,
                        but I never thought you'd get it to light fires.”</p>
                    <p>“But I did, you see,” said Chloe. “I taught it—little odd minutes when you
                        were carrying buckets and sticking up damp books on<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7142-062"/> their poor tails, so that you shouldn't notice
                        what I was doing. Isn't it a clever ghost? Aren't I a good teacher?”</p>
                    <p>“You are an angel,” I said. “I'll make the tea.”</p>
                    <p>“Aren't I a noble wife? Aren't you proud of me? Don't you love me very, very,
                        very?” said she.</p>
                    <p>“Not exactly,” said I, holding her in one arm and making the tea with the
                        other. “Respect, admiration for your talents—look out, you nearly had the
                        teapot over!—but love! Don't be exacting—and don't shake my arm, or I shall
                        scald us both. Go and get something dry on, and I'll cut some
                        sandwiches.”</p>
                    <p>“And you don't love me?”</p>
                    <p>“I might like you better if you were dry. Go! Run! Skurry!”</p>
                    <p>“The potted meat is in the chiffonnier,” she said. “Are you going to keep
                        wet?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I've got to go out and see what there is on the roof, as soon as it's
                        light enough to see to put up a ladder. Madam, withdraw, and take five drops
                        of eucalyptus oil on a piece of sugar.”</p>
                    <p>It was rather a pleasant breakfast, though the drip, drip, drip went on
                        merrily all the time.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7142-063"/>
                    <p>When the last sandwich had vanished Chloe put her elbows on the table and
                        said:</p>
                    <p>“Len, I'm afraid it's very wrong, but I've rather enjoyed myself. I seem to
                        like things to happen. But, oh, what a mess everything is in!”</p>
                    <p>“It is,” said I, “but I do, too. And it is wicked—a morbid craving for
                        excitement, even at the expense of a cherished library—the cream of our
                        country's literature. Now put on your macker, and we'll go up on the
                        roof.”</p>
                    <p>I helped her into her mackintosh, and we went.</p>
                    <p>The roof of the white parlor is one of the leaded spaces on the wings of the
                        Red House. It has a parapet at back and front. These formed a sort of tank;
                        all the waste-pipes were stuffed up with leaves and twigs, and I pulled a
                        black, sodden starlings' nest out of one of them. The rain came down
                        pitilessly. I looked about me. I knew that, below, the flood in the white
                        parlor must be momently gaining in depth and intensity.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe,” I said, “this is no time to be tender of bricks and mortar. Go and
                        fetch the bass-broom, and I will seek for the coal-hammer.”</p>
                    <p>I found it, after some search, in the pantry. I had taken it there myself, I
                        remember, in the<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7142-064"/> avowed belief that it, and
                        it only, could serve to break into the first gooseberry pie of Chloe's
                        making. I brought it up onto the roof, and with it smashed away the bricks
                        and cement till I had a two-foot embrasure in the back parapet. Then I
                        paused. A moment's silence full of concentrated reflection broke as I said,
                        “Wife of my heart, to think that quite by accident you have married a
                        mechanical genius!”</p>
                    <p>Then we went to find the spade. With it we dug clay from the banks of one of
                        the little streams which feed our moat. I transported it in the wheelbarrow,
                        always through the rain, to the scene of action, and we raised it to the
                        roof by a cord and the waste-paper basket. With it I built a dam round my
                        embrasure. Then again I paused in Napoleonic meditation, and then—</p>
                    <p>“The dust-pan, beloved,” I said, looking down on my wife's pink, rain-wet
                        face.</p>
                    <p>Then I knocked over the last three inches at the bottom of my embrasure. The
                        water from within my dam rushed out down the face of the house—behind the
                        dam lay the tank of water, but my dam held firm.</p>
                    <p>“And now a broom-handle, soul of my soul—or, I'll tell you what, that garden
                        rake we've never used, and some clothes-line.”</p>
                    <p>I spliced the dust-pan's handle at right angles<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7142-065"/> gles to the handle of the rake, and laid this
                        last across the embrasure. The parapet held its ends securely, and the
                        dust-pan, face downward, projected itself out through the opening. I made
                        all fast with clay and then called Chloe to come up the step-ladder and
                        share with me the triumphant moment when my dam should be broken down and my
                        new dust-pan-cum-rake water-shoot come into play. One's wife should share
                        one's joys as well as one's sorrows, I said.</p>
                    <p>The ingenious contrivance, which I thrilled to have found myself capable of
                        devising, acted perfectly. I kicked my dam to pieces, and the imprisoned
                        water behind rushed impetuously through the embrasure, and, directed by the
                        trusty dust-pan, fell in a cataract a yard and a half from the house, to
                        meander away harmlessly along the gravel path. I helped the flowing tide
                        with the bass-broom, and all the while the rain splashed and spun and
                        sputtered on mackintosh and bared heads. When the leads held but half an
                        inch of water I strengthened the dust-pan and rake with clay, and we went
                        indoors.</p>
                    <p>The white parlor was unspeakably wet—but the water no longer dripped from the
                        roof.</p>
                    <p>We mopped again, dried and dressed, and<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7142-066"/> did
                        our ordinary house-work. Then the sun came out. We took cushions and rugs
                        onto the balcony, and fell asleep. We slept till late in the afternoon. Then
                        I went to fetch a plumber. He came, many days later, cleared the wastepipes,
                        and sent me in a bill for £2 17s. 7d. This was the first charge on the
                        legacy we had received from my uncle.</p>
                    <p>The second was made by the inspector of the water company. He compelled us to
                        put in new patent taps all over the house. This cost £7 9s. 3d.; and when a
                        grand-maternal government came down on us about the question of sinks and
                        overflow-pipes—Chloe, in my absence, had the misfortune to cringe before its
                        minion—the matter ended in a bill of £29 19s. 11d.</p>
                    <p>Then I said: “Chloe, ruin stares us in the face. When we lived in the
                        Bandbox—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I know,” she interrupted, “but there's such a lot to do here.”</p>
                    <p>“The 'ouse is too large and the work too 'eavy,” I quoted.</p>
                    <p>“It isn't that, but everything's so large,” she said. “Why, it takes me two
                        hours to do the flowers, and they must be done three times a week at
                        least.”</p>
                    <p>“We must go flowerless, Chloe, or seek the<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7142-067"/>
                        refuge of the neighboring workhouse. Now, in the Bandbox—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I know,” she said again. “Oh, Len, don't scold—it's horrid of you!”</p>
                    <p>Remorselessly I pursued my advantage, for Chloe seemed to be in a yielding
                        mood.</p>
                    <p>“In the Bandbox—” I began, but she caught me by the shoulders and shook me
                        and took the words out of my mouth.</p>
                    <p>“In the Bandbox,” she said, “I worked and you worked. And now we don't either
                        of us work a bit more than we can help. And I know why it is, too—we've both
                        found out how interesting other things are. You'd rather chop wood or clean
                        the boots than write your nasty, dull articles and stories, and I'd rather
                        put up shelves and arrange flowers than draw silly pictures of idiotic
                        people for imbecile magazines. We're both demoralized by—what do you call
                        it?—the joy of life. I hate work. I wish it was dead!”</p>
                    <p>“Don't you call sweeping and scrubbing and cooking work?”</p>
                    <p>She hesitated, then: “No,” she cried, defiantly, “it isn't. Work is what you
                        hate doing, and have to do for your living. Anything else is play—you know
                        it is!”</p>
                    <p>“My gentle playfellow, we must work—either<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7142-068"/>
                        here, in our own Red House, or in the yellow brick mansion provided by a
                        tender country for its more obvious failures. The Red House or the
                        Union—which is it to be?”</p>
                    <p>“There's Uncle James's two hundred,” she said, with a mutinous glance.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe, Chloe,” I said, “I speak more in sorrow than in anger. In the
                        Bandbox—yes, I insist on my right to mention that hallowed spot as often as
                        I choose—you went to town twice a week to wring remunerative orders for
                        illustrations from the flinty hearts of editors. You have often explained to
                        me that to be on the spot is the thing. The work is given to the people who
                        look after it. How often have you been to London since my birthday? Once—and
                        that was the day when you went to the registry-office and brought back the
                        fiend who burned the bottom out of the kitchen kettle.”</p>
                    <p>She hung her head and said I was just as bad.</p>
                    <p>“I know it, but I am a practical reformer. Reforms personally attended to.
                        Brush my frockcoat, please, if you have any idea where it is, and my high
                        hat, if you can find it. I am going to town this afternoon. In my absence I
                        expect you to finish your illustration for the <title>Lady's
                            Battalion</title>—the one where the duchess is discharging<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7142-069"/> charging her butler for shaving in the boudoir,
                        and leaving his shaving-brush on the marble console-table.”</p>
                    <p>“You're not nice. You know it is a humble companion refusing a duke's offer
                        of marriage. He does look like a footman, I know; her arm is all wrong, and
                        his legs are hideously out of drawing. Legs <emph>are</emph> so difficult to
                        do, especially in clothes. We never had models in trousers at the Slade
                        School—”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, these art-schools!” I said. “Now find that frock-coat, my Michaela
                        Angelica, and speed the parting reformer.”</p>
                    <p>“I think I saw it once in the dresser drawer,” she said, dreamily. “If you'd
                        seen it you'd have put it away. Len, talking of shaving-brushes, how is it I
                        used to be so tidy in the Bandbox, and you not, and now you're tidier than I
                        am?”</p>
                    <p>“It is your influence,” said I.</p>
                    <p>“And the other's mine?”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” I answered, “when two people are moderately fond of each other they
                        do teach each other things, don't they?”</p>
                    <p>“Then you've corrupted me?”</p>
                    <p>“And you've redeemed me, or are redeeming. When we've quite converted each
                        other we can begin again and change back. But the coat, and the hat. I
                            <emph>must</emph> shave, and there's only<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7142-070"/> just time to catch the 11.32. For the sake of our home, for the sake of
                        our future, for the peace of our domestic existence, Chloe, do try to find
                        that hat and that coat!”</p>
                    <p>The hat was all right, but the coat was full of creases. It was not in the
                        dresser drawer, after all, but on the bottom shelf of the oak side-board,
                        and I had to iron it before I could dream of putting it on. Chloe told me
                        how to do it, but she owned that I did it far better than she could have
                        done it herself. My best boots were mislaid, too, as it happened, and,
                        before I had discovered them in a corner of the bare drawing-room, I had
                        missed the 11.32. I went up by the 12.40, however, and in the train I
                        wondered to myself how it was that Chloe, who in the Bandbox had kept all in
                        so neat an array, was now growing more untidy than I in my most reckless
                        moods had ever been. It was a problem, and I bent myself to it as the train
                        whirled me through green pastures outlined with elm-trees and hawthorn
                        hedges, then through villas, red and self-consciously trim, with their neat
                        gardens, geranium-flushed, calceolaria-gilded—neat as a prize map at a
                        first-class high-school. The problem did not resolve itself. It was not till
                        the train was rushing through a wilderness of yellow brick houses, all
                        alike, all soot-begrimed, all<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7142-071"/> standing,
                        with their bits of blackened garden, their stunted flowers, their carefully
                        trained snippets of creeper, for lives full of the courageous struggle of
                        man's innate love of beauty against the iron of environment, the crippling
                        of the accident of birth, the handicap of hereditary submission to the
                        undeserved darkening of life, that I began to see the answer to my
                        question.</p>
                    <p>In our first home—the Bandbox, the little nest that had held us at our first
                        mating—Chloe had struggled to reproduce, and had reproduced, on a
                        microscopic scale, and with the aid of a woman servant more or less
                        tractable, the habits and methods learned in her mother's house in Bedford.
                        There were rules, and she followed them. I for my part had met the new rules
                        as part of a new and delightful comedy, wherein my wife was heroine. At the
                        same time I had felt no urgent need for altering the habits of years spent
                        in chambers, at the mercy of an uncomplaining and systematically dishonest
                        laundress. But when the Bandbox—I paid it the tribute of a perfunctory sigh,
                        even in my railway-carriage solitude—when the dear Bandbox was left behind,
                        and we entered the Red House, we entered, too, on a new life—a primitive
                        existence where law was not. The rules Chloe had learned in Bedford as to
                        the duties of servants and the<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7142-072"/> routine of
                        domestic life were now inapplicable, since we had no servant, and
                        consequently no recognized routine. We were in the position of folk cast
                        upon a desert island (I mean an uninhabited one, but the phraseology, as the
                        instinct, of boyhood survives). And here we had suddenly changed parts. The
                        chart of custom by which Chloe had steered in Bandbox days had been reft
                        from her. She had nothing left but delightful, genuine impulses towards
                        beauty—the arrangement of flowers, the fixing of shelves, and the deep,
                        eternal instinct to satisfy the cravings of hunger in herself and hers—me.
                        I, on the other hand, being face to face with a new problem, met it, man
                        fashion, with a new solution. I perceived that order alone could make our
                        life in the Red House possible. As the train steamed over the bridge one
                        practical conclusion came as the result of my meditations. Chloe must have a
                        servant.</p>
                    <p>I saw several editors, received a commission to write a series of articles on
                        foreign politics, and a short story of strong domestic interest. Then I
                        stood at the corner by the Mansion House in a meditation so deep as to
                        provoke the amused and contemptuous scrutiny of my fellows, and at last,
                        just as a small boy was murmuring at my elbow, “Makin' up your mind whether
                            you'll<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7142-073"/> be prime-minister or not? Well,
                        take your time, sir; it's worth thinkin' over,” I hailed a 'bus and was
                        borne away by it. I went straight to Mrs. May's registry-office in Tottenham
                        Court Road. The ladies who attended to my needs seemed to me to have the
                        most perfect manners in the world. So well did they act for me that in half
                        an hour I had engaged an amiable general servant, who was to come on the
                        next Monday “as ever was.”</p>
                    <p>“Now look here,” I said to her, “you mustn't expect our house to be like any
                        one else's. We're not in the least like any one else. We live in a very
                        large house”—her plump face fell—“but we only use a few rooms. Your mistress
                        will help you a bit, and you can go out one evening a week and every Sunday,
                        and you can have your friends to see you any evening”—her face
                        brightened—“but no young men, unless they come by twos—see? My wife and I
                        will both help you, and if you help us we shall all be perfectly jolly. What
                        do you think? Would you like to try?”</p>
                    <p>I could see the smile Mrs. May was trying to conceal, and I felt a tremor of
                        doubt. Perhaps, after all, it did not do to treat servants as though they
                        were of the same flesh and blood as one's self.</p>
                    <pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7142-074"/>
                    <p>The girl hesitated, looked doubtfully at me, I smiled at her in my best
                        manner, and she smiled back heartily, and as it seemed to me without mental
                        reservations.</p>
                    <p>“Well, sir,” she said, “we can but try.”</p>
                    <p>So that was settled. I felt the warm point of triumph which punctuates the
                        career of the born organizer.</p>
                    <p>“Monday, then,” said I; “and send your box by Carter Paterson.” And with that
                        I left well alone, and went back to Cannon Street <foreign xml:lang="lat">via</foreign> the Twopenny Tube.</p>
                    <p>I had to wait half an hour for a train. On the platform was the usual dingy,
                        mixed crowd of clerks, type-writing girls, art students, and City men, and
                        among them, her red hair shining at me down the length of the gloomy
                        platform, a woman's figure that I knew. Her dainty dress of muslin, sown
                        with little bunches of violets, her charming hat, her perfect gloves and
                        shoes—these alone might not have thrust her identity on me. Thank Heaven,
                        more than one Englishwoman wears pretty muslin gowns and picture-hats, and
                        has gloves and shoes that fit her. It was the set of her shoulders, the
                        poise of her head, the modest, graceful self-possession of her attitude that
                        made me bold to step behind her, and, without even a sight of her face,
                            to<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7142-075"/> murmur over her shoulder and into
                        the prettiest ear—almost—in the world, “Yolande!”</p>
                    <p>She turned in a flash, and her face came to me in that dull place like a
                        gleam of sunlight in a cloudy day.</p>
                    <p>“How unexpected you are,” I said, “and how very, very like the most beautiful
                        kind of French fashion-plate.”</p>
                    <p>“I was going down to see Chloe—and you. I have got a bag somewhere,” she
                        said. “I am pretty, aren't I? I got this gown in Paris.”</p>
                    <p>“That's what I like about you!”</p>
                    <p>“The only thing?”</p>
                    <p>“The chief, just now. You don't think old clothes rhyme necessarily with old
                        friends. There's just time for a cup of tea—come. And then for the Red
                        House. We shall find Chloe in rags, clearing out the scullery. You don't
                        know—or rather you do, perfectly well—what a sight for sore eyes you'll be
                        to her.”</p>
                    <p>My prophecy was fulfilled. My wife opened the door to us.</p>
                    <p>“Yolande!” she cried, “I didn't know you were back!”</p>
                    <p>“No more did I, till yesterday,” said Yolande.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe!” I cried, with proper severity, “have you done that drawing of the
                        footman and the duchess? Your face is extremely dirty!”</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7142-076"/>
                    <p>She looked at me with that disarming blink of soft lashes for the sake of
                        which the harshest of recording angels would risk his situation.</p>
                    <p>“I've been cleaning out the kitchen,” she said—“it's lovely now. Yolande,
                        come and take your things off. He'll make the tea and set the table. He's
                        quite domestic now—aren't you, Benedick?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, Beatrice,” I said; “and there's a large black on your respectable
                        ear—the right one.”</p>
                    <p>“The better to hear with, my dear.”</p>
                    <p>“And why are your hands so extremely grimy?” I returned, capping the
                        quotation.</p>
                    <p>“The better to slap you with!” she cried, the action rhyming with the word,
                        and fled.</p>
                    <p>She came down to tea all white muslin and lace and pink ribbons. “It's
                        Yolande's fault,” she said. deprecatingly. “I hate being smart myself. It's
                        so unsuitable to our position. Don't look at me like that!”</p>
                    <p>Throughout tea I could look at nothing else. Yolande is a witch. How else
                        could she have known that in these weeks of happy, hard work I had vaguely
                        missed something, somehow, and had never guessed till now that it was my
                        wife's beauty, so unadorned, and still so dear, that had fretted me with the
                        unconscious desire to see it once more fitly clothed?</p>
                    <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7142-077"/>
                    <p>The evening was a festival. Yolande played Chopin to us in the dim, empty
                        drawing-room, and if I did hold my wife's hand the while, Yolande did not
                        mind, for she was used to us. Chloe showed us the duchess and footman
                        drawing, and indeed the duchess's arm was hopelessly wrong, and the
                        footman's legs things to weep over. We drank ginger-ale, always with us the
                        outward expression of hilarity, and, as the evening waned, sang comic songs.
                        When Yolande had gone to bed, in the room got ready for the servants who
                        never came, I caught my wife by both hands.</p>
                    <p>“Madam,” said I, “why did you never tell me how pretty you looked in pink
                        ribbons?”</p>
                    <p>“I didn't think you cared for ribbons,” she said; “besides, it's all
                        Yolande's fault.”</p>
                    <p>“To-morrow morning,” said I, “I shall kiss Yolande for this.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe looked at me. “You may,” she said. “I don't think she'd like it, but
                        you may. Only don't do it while I'm there, because it might make me
                        jealous.”</p>
                    <p>“What, Chloe in pink ribbons jealous of Yolande in violet muslin? I might as
                        well be jealous of the crossing-sweeper when you smile at him and give him
                        pennies.”</p>
                    <p>“And aren't you?” said she. “You would<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7142-078"/> be,
                        if you were a really nice husband. But I'll tell Yolande you said she was
                        like a crossing-sweeper. And she wouldn't let you kiss her, anyway!”</p>
                    <p>“What do you bet?”</p>
                    <p>“If she did it would only be to please me! And if you did it would only be to
                        tease me. No, you can't tease me!” She paused, then—“And, Len,” she said,
                        “Yolande's too dear to have silly jokes made about her, even by you and only
                        to me, or even to you and only by me.”</p>
                    <p>“And you're too dear,” I said, with my face against the pink ribbons, “to be
                        teased, even if I could compass it. Besides, madam, I have been guilty of a
                        crime—worse, an error in taste. I might be a hair-dresser's apprentice
                        chaffing his sweetheart of the drapery department. Forgive me—I am a little
                        mad to-night.”</p>
                    <p>She pushed me away till she could look in my eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Len,” she said, “how awful it would have been if I had married any one else.
                        There is no one else who understands everything. But why did you? You never
                        made jokes about kissing other people before!”</p>
                    <p>“It is detestable,” I said, “and it's no excuse to repeat that it was only
                        because I am so happy. And yet it's true. Am I forgiven?”</p>
                    <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7142-079"/>
                    <p>Now what made me talk that nonsense? And suppose Chloe had laughed at it or,
                        on the other hand, had taken it seriously, where should we have been? Now,
                        Heaven be praised for the gift of understanding. If Chloe had done, had
                        looked, anything but what she did do and look—But Chloe is Chloe, and, thank
                        God, mine.</p>
                    <p>Yolande stayed with us three days. The rainbow delights of our new house
                        seemed newly dyed when we displayed them to her appreciative eyes. And I
                        felt a new impulse to work, now that Chloe had some one to bear her company
                        as she gathered flowers, rearranged furniture, or struggled, face all aglow,
                        against the fiendish arts of the kitchen range.</p>
                    <p>I wrote half my “story of strong domestic interest,” and then stuck fast.
                        There was a scene where the hero, on the point of marriage with a
                        respectable and admired heiress, the friend of childhood's hour, sees, as he
                        walks up the church to his bridal, the face of his old love, whom he had
                        thought dead. This scene wanted something besides smartness. It wanted fire,
                        passion, delicacy of handling, strength of grasp. And these qualities,
                        strange to say, eluded me. I told my woes, and received from Chloe and
                        Yolande sympathy, but no aid.</p>
                    <p>On that third moonlight evening, when we<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7142-080"/> sat
                        out on the grass, round the sun-dial, and Yolande sang Spanish and Pyrenean
                        songs to the tinkle of Chloe's guitar, I almost seemed to surprise in myself
                        the force to grapple with that scene and get the better of it; but when they
                        had gone to bed and I sat face to face with my type-writer, the force
                        shrivelled to a very agony of conscious incompetence. I wrote three abject
                        sentences, and went to bed hopeless.</p>
                    <p>Next morning I took Yolande to a cricket match, and in the evening she left
                        us.</p>
                    <p>“I'll come again in a fortnight if you'll have me,” she said, “but now I must
                        put on my soberest frock and a hat that would make you weep, and interview
                        parents who want to provide their girls with a complete outfit of up-to-date
                        culture, cheap.”</p>
                    <p>We went up to the little country station, bareheaded, ungloved, to the
                        scandal of the porters and the station-master, and waved our farewells as
                        the train bore her away. Chloe's clean handkerchief had a great hole in it,
                        which she never noticed till too late, and then we went back, she to
                        house-work, and I to my story. I had left it at page thirty-one; it stood
                        now at page fifty-nine.</p>
                    <p>The story was finished. I read the pages rapidly. The story was good, very
                        good. All<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7142-081"/> the fire and passion and force I
                        had longed for and had known to be necessary were here. The story began
                        tamely, and ended in vivid and triumphant drama.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe!” I called.</p>
                    <p>She came, a dish-cloth in her hand and apron round her waist.</p>
                    <p>“Some one has finished the story. Read it.”</p>
                    <p>She read it slowly.</p>
                    <p>“Is it good?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“Of course it is. But did you— Who did it?”</p>
                    <p>“Didn't you?”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>No</emph>, of course not!”</p>
                    <p>“It must have been the ghost,” she said. Then she blinked at me with long
                        lashes, and laughed.</p>
                    <p>I laughed too.</p>
                    <p>“The ghost be it!” I said, but I read in her laughing eyes the word that
                        sprang to my own lips—“Yolande!”</p>

                    <head type="sub">OUR NEW TENANT</head>
                    <p><hi>OF</hi> course we have our own little stereotyped code of honor and
                        morality, laid by on the shelf, ready for use, and in it we read vaguely
                        that one may not put one's name to another's work, or make money by
                        another's success. Had any one offered to finish for me the story to which I
                        should put my name, I had refused, though the offer had been made by Rudyard
                        Kipling himself. But when a ghost finishes your story, what's to be done? As
                        Chloe said, “What else did the ghost do it for?” She added that of course I
                        must send it in. And indeed it seemed to me that the matter was at least
                        arguable. Yet I could not bring myself to sign my name to the thing.</p>
                    <p>Chloe made horseshoes in her forehead, and professed herself unable to
                        understand my hesitation.</p>
                    <p>“If the ghost chose to finish your silly old<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7142-083"/>
                        story,” she said, “you may be sure it wants to see itself in print.”</p>
                    <p>“Over my signature?”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps the ghost is modest, and would rather not venture to face the public
                        over its own signature till it's more sure of its talents. Yes—that must be
                        it. It's a mutual benefit. The ghost wants to see itself printed. You wanted
                        your story finished. There's no obligation either way.”</p>
                    <p>I bit the end of my fountain-pen till it cracked.</p>
                    <p>“Suppose we ask Yolande?” said I. Chloe laughed. And I wrote to Yolande that
                        evening. Chloe wrote, too—about a pattern for a <foreign xml:lang="fre">fichu</foreign>, I believe—and we posted the letters in the village.
                        When we came home we found an unattractive working-man slouching by our
                        gate. As we approached, he touched his hat with a grudging gesture.</p>
                    <p>“You the governor?” he inquired.</p>
                    <p>I ventured a modest assent.</p>
                    <p>“About these 'ere cottages of yourn, now,” said he, “was you thinkin' of
                        lettin' e'er a one of 'em?”</p>
                    <p>“Well, no,” said I, truthful in defiance of Chloe's finger-pressure on my
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>“Because if you was,” said my visitor, rubbing a stubbly chin reflectively,
                        “you and me<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7142-084"/> might hit on a bargain betwixt
                        us. My missus an' me we're a-lookin' out for a bit of a cottage, so I don't
                        deceive you, governor.”</p>
                    <p>My tenant-aspirant inspired me with little admiration and less confidence,
                        but Chloe pinched my arm again, and said,</p>
                    <p>“Can you do gardening?”</p>
                    <p>“I'm a bricklayer's laborer by trade, miss,” said he.</p>
                    <p>“But if we let you have the cottage we should expect you to keep the cottage
                        garden tidy.”</p>
                    <p>“Gardening's all I care for, out of workin'-hours,” said the man, eagerly,
                        “and my missus, she's the same. Dotes on flowers, lilies, and roses, and
                        toolips, so she do.”</p>
                    <p>“I'll think of it,” said I, severely non-committal, and feigning
                        insensibility as Chloe's fingers tightened almost painfully on my arm.</p>
                    <p>“What rent do you want to pay?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>At the word “want” a shadow of a grin passed under the reflective hand that
                        stroked the stubble.</p>
                    <p>“Two shillings a week was about what we thought an honest rent,” was the
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>“That wouldn't do at all,” said my wife. “Why, the smallest cottage has four
                        rooms. We couldn't let it under four shillings.”</p>
                    <p>“Say three and six, lady. And that's a lot to a working-man.”</p>
                    <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7142-085"/>
                    <p>This alacritous acceptance of the raised figure should have warned us—I,
                        indeed, did perceive that the man wanted the cottage enough to pay the four
                        shillings for it. But Chloe said:</p>
                    <p>“Very well. Three and six a week—that's nine pounds two a year. When do you
                        want to come in?”</p>
                    <p>“Our time's up next Saturday, miss,” said the man, “and we could get our bits
                        of sticks moved then. It's a stiffish rent, miss, is nine pun two a year,
                        but there's the garden. I am dead nuts on a bit of garden.”</p>
                    <p>“On Saturday, then,” said Chloe, and our new tenant left us. I was full of
                        doubts and distrusts, which I turned to impart to Chloe; but as our gate
                        slammed behind us she threw her arms round my neck in a transport of
                        avaricious enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len! How splendid! Didn't I do the arithmetic beautifully? Why did we
                        never think of letting the cottages before? We'll let all the others—three
                        and sixpence each—and the big ones—ought to fetch more. Why, it's fourteen
                        shillings a week. What a heap of money!”</p>
                    <p>“What do you propose to buy with it, Mrs. Midas?”</p>
                    <p>“Time!” she answered, promptly. “Now I sha'n't feel so wicked if I waste a
                        whole day on<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7142-086"/> pottering. Why don't you write
                        an ode or a sonnet or something, about pottering? It's the most glorious
                        thing in the world. And this man is going to pay me to potter while he lays
                        bricks. Noble, splendid creature!”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>This man</emph>,” I said, “exactly; we don't even know his name, we
                        haven't a hint of his address. And who are we—land-owners, truly, but born
                        potterers, and lacking the education accorded to those born to the purple of
                        landlordism—who are we that we should ask a bricklayer's laborer for
                        references?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, dear!” said she. “I never thought of that! Never mind—we can ask him for
                        them on Saturday.”</p>
                    <p>But on Saturday it was too late. We learned, indeed, during the course of the
                        day, our tenant's name, and it was Prosser, than which no surname claims a
                        larger share of my personal abhorrence; but where was the use of asking for
                        references when the moving had been effected during the hours immediately
                        following the dawn, when our after-breakfast expedition to the cottage
                        showed us the “bits of sticks” already dumped down on the cottage-garden
                        flower-beds, and a slatternly drab of a woman carrying them slowly in? The
                        furniture looked very dirty.</p>
                    <p>“Not, I fear, the most desirable of tenants,”<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7142-087"/> I murmured, as we delicately withdrew. “The furniture looks as if it had
                        come out of the dustbin, and so does the lady.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don't be so harsh,” said my wife; “remember what <emph>our</emph>
                        furniture looked like—all dusty and forlorn and friendless—when it sat
                        outside the Bandbox waiting for the vans. And as for the woman, you wouldn't
                        like any one to judge <emph>me</emph> by how I looked the day we moved.”</p>
                    <p>“I remember just how you looked,” I said. And indeed I did. “My dear, Yolande
                        was absolutely right. We are perfect Babes in the Wood. We have let our
                        cottage to the ideally undesirable tenant. I don't for a moment believe that
                        he is a bricklayer's laborer! More likely a counterfeit-coiner's
                        journeyman—or perhaps a master-thief. He is ideally undesirable, you are
                        impetuous, and I am weakly yielding. You and I together deserve to be sat on
                        by a Board. Why can't we turn ourselves into a limited company and be run,
                        together with our little property, by competent directors?”</p>
                    <p>“We must try to arrange it,” she answered, gayly. “And now cheer up—the
                        Prossers will be better when they get straight. That girl's coming to-day—I
                        must get her room ready. You might just clean the front doorstep—it's done
                        with hearth-stone, just like the kitchen hearth.<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7142-088"/> It is enough to discourage any girl to come to a
                        house wrapped in a mantle of decay, with green mould on the doorstep. Then
                        afterwards we'll do the kitchen together.”</p>
                    <p>It was with but half a heart that I collected pail, hearth-stone, and
                        house-flannel. I had to take a scrubbing-brush to the green mould, and I
                        wondered why the favorite implement gave me so little joy as I wielded it.
                        The sudden arrival of the new maid's box, by Carter Paterson, enlightened
                        me. I found myself now working with vigor and enthusiasm. Since she really
                            <emph>was</emph> coming! I knew then that I had never believed she would
                        come, and it had seemed futile to spread milk-white over the doorstep, just
                        for Chloe and me, whose eyes its blotted gray and moss green had always
                        delighted. Now I finished the doorstep <foreign xml:lang="ita">con
                            amore</foreign>, and hastened to the kitchen where Chloe and a hammer
                        were busy together. I scrubbed the dressers and the table and the deal shelf
                        that pulls out under the window. Chloe is always wise enough to feed energy
                        with praise—a diet too often grudged it.</p>
                    <p>“You do scrub beautifully,” she said. “I believe you think the brush is
                        nobler than the pen.”</p>
                    <p>“You see I am an able ‘performer on the instrument,’ as Jane Austen would
                        say.”</p>
                    <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7142-089"/>
                    <p>“Dear Jane,” said Chloe. “There—there's glory for you!”</p>
                    <p>She had nailed up a deep flounce of green and red chintz along the
                        chimney-piece, and another above the windows. A cushion to match nestled in
                        the shabby Windsor arm-chair we had recently picked up for two and
                        threepence in a back street in Deptford.</p>
                    <p>“Isn't it pretty? Isn't it cosey, and old-fashioned, and farm-housy? If this
                        doesn't make her stay, nothing will! I'll get the hearth-rug out of our
                        bedroom. You won't mind, will you? And do put your instrument away—there's
                        no more scrubbing, and she'll be here directly. Do you think we could bear
                        to let her have two of the brass candlesticks out of the white parlor for
                        this mantel-piece?”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>No</emph>,” I said, firmly; “there are limits. But put up the
                        cake-tins—I polished them the other day.”</p>
                    <p>The cake-tins were a shining crown to the splendor of the chintz flounce. Our
                        crockery, well spread out upon the two large dressers, made a brave show.
                        Our bedroom hearth-rug, also woven of reds and greens, showed up the beauty
                        of the chintz flounce, which in its turn, by its neat newness, added lustre
                        and importance to the hearth-rug. It was indeed a beautiful picture<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7142-090"/> —a poem, even, set to music by the singing
                        of the new kitchen kettle, and I did not grudge the sacrifice of the parlor
                        table-cloth to the completion of that radiant harmony.</p>
                    <p>We had our lunch in a very great hurry, so as to get the plates washed up
                        before our new servant came. By two o'clock all was ready. Ever since the
                        joyous day when in my well-ironed frock-coat I had gone forth and engaged a
                        servant, Chloe had ventured, day by day, on more and more daring
                        preparations for the maid's arrival, and Chloe had dragged me with her. We
                        had cleaned the white parlor—when we had a servant we could afford to sit in
                        a parlor. We had laid down a rug or two on the red-and-white marble of the
                        hall, and hung two or three old prints on the dull brown of its walls. We
                        sat out some oak chairs and the old elm kneading-trough in it by way of
                        furniture. We had put up dimity curtains in the new maid's bedroom: Chloe
                        insisted on these, not because she admired the material, but because
                        “dimity” is such a nice word—the born sister of lavender, and tall presses,
                        and well-scrubbed boards, and patch-work quilts. We had a patch-work
                        quilt—the gift of a gaunt great-aunt of mine—and we sacrificed it to the
                        fitness of things, and let it live with the dimity curtains. Chloe adorned
                        the dimity-covered dressing<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7142-091"/> ing-table with
                        a smart, new pin-cushion with blue bows, and set a blue jug of pink roses on
                        the broad window-sill. Our servant's bedroom was as pretty as paint. I said
                        so, and Chloe said:</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense! it's only conventionally correct. All good girls' rooms in books
                        are like this—if they're servants; if they're young ladies it is muslin
                        instead of dimity. And the pin-cushion is sometimes pink—you put letters
                        under it when you run away, you know.”</p>
                    <p>“I hope the roses aren't just the touch too much,” I said; “we mustn't spoil
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>“Roses spoil nobody.”</p>
                    <p>“Or make her think us lunatics.”</p>
                    <p>“We <emph>are</emph> that,” said Chloe, “and it's better to recognize frankly
                        that concealment is impossible. No one could live with us a month and not
                        see how silly we are. It's better not to try to break things to people. Let
                        her know the worst at once. If she doesn't have to waste her mental energies
                        on finding out our follies, she may use them to perceive our virtues. I
                        sometimes can't help thinking that we really are rather nice.”</p>
                    <p>No courtier expecting a visit from his sovereign ever waited the monarch's
                        advent with half the anxious embarrassment that was ours as, I in flannels
                        and Chloe in soft muslin, we sat in the<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7142-092"/>
                        wicker chairs by the front porch, with our books and our work-basket, in an
                        atmosphere of elegant leisure, <foreign xml:lang="fre">ayant l'air de
                            rien</foreign>, just as if we sat there idly every day of the week.</p>
                    <p>At half-past three the white smoke of the down train clouded the blue above
                        our willow-trees. Chloe put her hand to her heart.</p>
                    <p>“If I faint, don't be surprised. But you must pretend to be! Don't let her
                        think fainting's a habit of mine. All the other servants came to us and they
                        went, and there it was. But this is a crisis—an epoch.”</p>
                    <p>“That's because you feel that she's going to stay,” I said; “her personality
                        is influencing yours, as she comes down the lane.”</p>
                    <p>Breaking a silence full of emotion came the click of the front gate.</p>
                    <p>“Courage!” I murmured.</p>
                    <p>“My heart's in my mouth,” said she.</p>
                    <p>“I must have mislaid it. Give it back at once!”</p>
                    <p>“How can you talk nonsense at a solemn moment like this? No—don't come with
                        me. I'll face the danger alone!”</p>
                    <p>I saw her meet the new servant and lead her into the house.</p>
                    <p>It was an anxious time. I could not read, and I was trying to go on with
                        Chloe's duster-<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7142-093"/> hemming when she came back,
                        with bright eyes and no horseshoes on her brow.</p>
                    <p>“She's a dear,” said my wife, “and so are you. And I was quite right about
                        the roses and the pin-cushion. When I took her into the bedroom she looked
                        quite blank, and then she said:</p>
                    <p>“‘This is the spare room, I suppose, mum.’ And I said, ‘No, it's yours.’ And
                        she just said, ‘<emph>Well</emph>’ and sniffed at the roses. And she came
                        down almost directly. Oh, what beautiful things clean caps and aprons are!
                        And she's getting the tea, Len. And she likes the kitchen. And she said it
                        was like their kitchen at home. I do believe she's going to be nice!”</p>
                    <p>She was. Chloe and I had simplified our lives, as people always do when their
                        own hands supply their wants. Mary accepted Chloe's assistance for two days,
                        and then gently but firmly declined further help.</p>
                    <p>“Why,” she said, “I could do the work here with one hand behind me! You go
                        along, mum, and play the pianna, and mess about with the flowers, or make
                        your pretty pictures.”</p>
                    <p>The change in our lives was like the change from a stormy night in mid-ocean
                        to the mid-summer calm of a daisied meadow. The house was always neat and
                        clean, and yet there was<pb xml:id="VAB7142-094"/>
                        <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7142-095"/> time for everything. I wrote now,
                        sometimes we went to town when we wanted to go, orders grew, and prosperity
                        seemed, like the rainbow, to be waiting for us at the end of the next field.
                        It was a happy breathing-space. Yolande wrote, fully endorsing Chloe's view,
                        and insisting that the ghost would certainly not have been silly enough to
                        write half a story unless it had wanted to see it in print, and recommending
                        us to leave the galleys conveniently lying about in the more haunted-looking
                        parts of the Red House, so that the ghost might, if it pleased, correct its
                        own proofs. So we sent off the story, and the editor wrote to me. I got his
                        letter at breakfast, and I threw it over to Chloe across the tea-tray.</p>
                    <p>“Fortune smiles at last,” said I. “Here's to the ghost!” and I drank its
                        health in boiling tea.</p>
                    <p>The letter had all the beauty of simplicity.</p>
                    <p>“Dear sir,” it said, “your story, ‘The Return,’ to hand. It is quite
                        satisfactory, and if you care to supply a series of six, in the same style,
                        we could, I think, find room for them in the magazine during next year.” The
                        editor said something vague but pleasant about terms, and added that he was
                        faithfully mine, and the letter concluded with the name of a very lucky
                        man.</p>
                    <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7142-096"/>
                    <p>“It is my name at the foot,” I said. “This piece of luck has happened to
                            <emph>me</emph>! It ought to have been addressed to Messrs. Ghost &amp;
                        Co., oughtn't it? Aid me, ye powers! Six stories!”</p>
                    <p>“In the same style,” said Chloe, getting up from the tea-tray and coming
                        behind me to pull my ears in sheer gladness of heart. “Are you going to
                        imitate the ghost's style, Len?”</p>
                    <p>I did not answer.</p>
                    <p>She rested her chin on my shoulder.</p>
                    <p>“Of course you write much better than the ghost,” she said, hastily; “but he
                            <emph>does</emph> say the same style.”</p>
                    <p>“I have written stories before—and I can do it again, I suppose,” said I. “I
                        only happened to get stuck with that story. I should have finished it all
                        right if the ghost hadn't interfered. I wish to goodness she'd let it
                        alone!”</p>
                    <p>Chloe took her chin from my shoulder and went back to the tea-tray.</p>
                    <p>“Will you have another cup?” she said, coldly.</p>
                    <p>“What's the matter?”</p>
                    <p>She did not answer.</p>
                    <p>Then I caught at my lost temper and secured it. I laughed.</p>
                    <p>“What!” I said, “take part with a nasty, stuck-up ghost against your own
                        husband—so talented, yet so modest? If I am to have a rival, let it be<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7142-097"/> flesh and blood, and not a ghost whose
                        head I cannot punch, whose back I cannot horsewhip!”</p>
                    <p>“Well, then,” she said, trying to balance a teaspoon on the milk-jug, “I
                        think the ghost only meant to be kind, and I don't like to hear you speak as
                        if you thought it had no business to interfere.”</p>
                    <p>“I see,” I said, slowly.</p>
                    <p>She flashed a quick glance at me. “Yes,” she said, “I see you see. Here's
                        luck to the six stories!”</p>
                    <p>It was in the morning after one of Mary's evenings out that she came to Chloe
                        and said:</p>
                    <p>“Please, mum, are those your cottages along by the garden wall?”</p>
                    <p>Chloe smiled, scenting another tenant.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” she said. “Do you know any one—”</p>
                    <p>“Well, mum,” said Mary, “I think it's no more but right that you should know
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe said, “What?”</p>
                    <p>Mary replied: “Why, their goings-on! I see him last night, as I come in, as
                        drunk as drunk, lying all over the front garden, and I went down this
                        morning to have another look.”</p>
                    <p>“And was he still there—all over the front garden?” I asked.</p>
                    <p>“No, sir, not him, but everything else you can think of. But I won't say not
                        a word more,<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7142-098"/> sir; but it's not respectable,
                        and I thought you ought to know, sir. You're that innocent, sir, if you'll
                        excuse me saying so. I know you won't believe no harm of any one till you
                        have caught 'em at it. You just go and look, sir, that's all.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe and I walked down the garden path, hand in hand, in agitated silence.
                        Not till we were safe hidden under the twisted quince-tree did we dare to
                        look at each other. Then we sat down in the long grass expressly to laugh at
                        our ease.</p>
                    <p>“And the worst of it is it's true,” Chloe said. “You <emph>are</emph>
                        innocent. No—don't be offended. I'm afraid I am, too. We are Babes in the
                        Wood, Len, just as Yolande said, and Mary has the sense to see it.”</p>
                    <p>I murmured something about references.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I know you said so, and I know it's my fault; but other things are
                        yours. You <emph>are</emph> innocent. Don't deny it. Oh, Len, we ought to be
                        living in a villa, and paying proper little calls, and giving proper little
                        dinners, and decorating our dinner-table with proper little cut flowers in
                        proper little cut-glass vases; and when we dined alone the fishmonger would
                        send in two proper little whitings with their proper little tails in their
                        mouths; and we should have roast chicken, and it would be minced the next
                        day, and<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7142-099"/> everything would go by dull,
                        beautiful, proper little clock-work; and you would say what a good manager I
                        was, because we neither of us should have any idea what good management
                        really meant. We're failures, Len. We haven't the wit to run a great
                        estate.”</p>
                    <p>“In fact,” I said, “we've bitten off a larger chunk than we can chew.”</p>
                    <p>“Don't be vulgar!”</p>
                    <p>“I'm not—I'm trying to be American.”</p>
                    <p>“You're not succeeding. They don't talk like that. I knew an American once.
                        He was the nicest—”</p>
                    <p>“I know. He thought <emph>you</emph> were the nicest. Why didn't you marry
                        him?”</p>
                    <p>“Because he was rich, and it's my destiny to ruin a poor man. Len, I wish I
                        wasn't such an idiot!”</p>
                    <p>“Or that I wasn't. That would do just as well. But don't let's weep about it
                        yet. Perhaps Mary exaggerated. Our tenant may merely have been in a fit. No
                        known system of manorial management can avert fits among the tenantry.”</p>
                    <p>“But she said, ‘You go and look, that's all!’”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said I, rising, “I <emph>will</emph> go and look. Will you come?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” said she. “I'm frightened. Yes, I will, of course.”</p>
                    <pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7142-100"/>
                    <p>And we went.</p>
                    <p>Outside the red wall of our garden is a strip of ground bounded by a hawthorn
                        hedge, and at the end of this stand the two cottages. We passed along the
                        winding shrubbery-walk—by reason of its darkness the only path of our garden
                        whereon the weeds were not breast-high—and so, pushing through the
                        tall-standing weeds, dock and nettle, sow-thistle and cow-parsley, of the
                        cottage garden, to the square of ground that stands between our two cottages
                        and the road. Here were no juicy, green, upstanding weeds, graceful in their
                        arrogant victory over flowers and fruits. The green weeds were trampled down
                        to a damp, yellow, sodden mass, sordid and evilsmelling. Old meat-cans,
                        sardine-tins, broken boots, decayed brooms, and battered saucepans were
                        strewn around, “like flowers at a festival.” Dirty rags festooned the faded
                        blue of the railings; the family linen, wetted but not washed, hung on the
                        elder-bushes, whose white blossoms drooped degraded under the foul burden. A
                        very dirty blanket hung out of the bedroom window, and on the doorstep,
                        among dust and flue, bones, crusts, and the miscellaneous sweepings of a
                        filthy floor, three indescribably unengaging children, with dirty noses,
                        were playing moodily and without smiles. Their playthings were a<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7142-101"/> blade-bone of mutton, two muddy clothes-pegs, and
                        a dead mouse.</p>
                    <p>Chloe is absurdly fond of children, but—or, perhaps, therefore—she turned
                        away with a shudder. We went home boiling with indignation, but in the
                        crucible of our thought our rage, as it cooled, left as precipitate the
                        unmistakable consciousness of our own incompetence. True, as Chloe said, it
                        was she who had accepted a tenant so manifestly undesirable—lured by a bait
                        of fourteen shillings a month. She had done it, but I had stood by and let
                        it be done. Now, however, I must act. I would act. Was it, I wonder, an
                        inexcusable cowardice or a wise discretion which led me to refrain from
                        giving Mr. Prosser notice in a personal interview? I wrote to him, and bade
                        him leave my cottage at the end of the week. But at the end of the week he
                        was still there, and on the Monday evening, as Chloe and I wandered in the
                        green forest of weeds and flowers that was our garden, the spell of its
                        silence was broken for us by the sound of Mr. Prosser's voice, uplifted in
                        one of the less agreeable comic songs of the year before the year before
                        last.</p>
                    <p>I went down at once to give him, personally, that notice to quit which I
                        found him in no fit state to receive. Another call, in the morning,<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7142-102"/> found my tenant conscious, indeed, but
                        little amenable.</p>
                    <p>“I gave you written notice to quit last week,” said I. “How is it you've not
                        gone?”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Prosser, unshaved, without tie, collar, or boots, settled his head
                        between his shoulders, and said he didn't know anything about no notice.</p>
                    <p>“Well, anyhow,” said I, “you've got to clear out now. I want the
                        cottage.”</p>
                    <p>“Right you are, sir,” said he, “but there must be proper notice give an'
                        took.”</p>
                    <p>“I give you notice <emph>now</emph>,” said I, “and, while I am here, suppose
                        you hand over the rent.”</p>
                    <p>Then my tenant drew himself up and uttered these memorable words:</p>
                    <p>“I'm a yearly tenant, I am, and I pays on quarter-day, and six months' notice
                        is what I'm entitled to. ‘Nine pun two a year,’ your missus said.”</p>
                    <p>“Very well. I shall consult my solicitor,” I said, and turned away helpless.
                        I didn't know—how should I, though I had kicked my heels, briefless, in the
                        Inner Temple for at least two years—whether he was entitled to that or
                        anything else.</p>
                    <p>I wrote to my solicitor. I had never had a solicitor before, but I acquired
                        one at once—<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7142-103"/> an old chum. He wrote me three
                        pages of advice, in which a writ of ejectment loomed large. But his private
                        opinion, as I read it between the lines, seemed to be that I had got myself
                        into a tight place by my own folly, and had better trust to time to get me
                        out of it.</p>
                    <p>Our garden's peace was broken. We never knew now when the hoarse, raucous
                        voice of our tenant might desecrate the moonlit stillness with coarse echoes
                        of transpontine musichalls. The knowledge of Mr. Prosser's nearness seemed
                        to smirch the clean sweetness of life. The very jasmine stars seemed less
                        white for the presence of our tenant's sordid <foreign xml:lang="fre">ménage</foreign> on the other side of our red wall. And Mary, day by
                        day, tormented us with fresh tales of what was being said in the village of
                        our tenant's antecedents and character, and, by implication, of ours. And
                        all the time my inability to set steadfastly to work was fretting at my
                        self-control. It is like a mouse gnawing at the cord of life—the longing to
                        work, and the inability to conquer the thousand tiny obstacles that fate
                        erects—fate, backed by one's own folly in having “bitten off a larger chunk
                        than one can chew”;—I still think that a most excellent phrase, and not
                        vulgar, only homely, going straight to the mark as the homely expression<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7142-104"/> of a great truth may be permitted to do.
                        Chloe was worried also—her editors were clamoring for the illustrations
                        which she was now incapable of working at. And Mr. Prosser was a live
                        blister, and, like a blister, he hurt more and more the longer we had to
                        bear with him.</p>
                    <p>I was sitting in our little work-room one morning, pen in hand, hardly able
                        to meet with a confident eye the white paper that, as I stared at it, seemed
                        to stare at me in return—to stare rudely, contemptuously, in the confident
                        superiority of its fulfilment of its destiny, as opposed to my manifest
                        inability to fulfil mine. It was waiting to be written on, and no one could
                        ask more of it. And I was waiting to write on it; and a good deal more than
                        mere waiting was obviously demanded of me by our financial circumstances and
                        my own self-respect. The six stories—“in the style of the ghost”—I longed to
                        get them written with a longing more desperate than the longing of the lover
                        for his mistress, the mother for her child. Though more desperate, it had
                        not, however, the force of these natural desires, because it was not a
                        desire for the thing in itself—not a desire to achieve, to attain—but
                        depended for its vitality on a secondary motive. I longed to write the
                        stories because I wanted the money they would bring<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7142-105"/> to me. The longing was keen enough to be painful,
                        not strong enough to get itself satisfied. So I sat idle, and drew fancy
                        portraits of Chloe on the blotting-paper. I turned it over hastily as I
                        heard her footstep on the kitchen floor, and I was bending over a virgin
                        quarto page rimmed with unsoiled pink when she came in.</p>
                    <p>I drew my breath in sharply. Her face, her eyes, her whole bearing announced
                        disaster unspeakable.</p>
                    <p>“What is it?” I cried, and I am sure I must have turned pale.</p>
                    <p>“Len, do you love me?” she asked, clasping her hands with a charming dramatic
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>“Better than my life, of course,” I said, hurriedly, “but I'm just starting
                        on this story, and if it's some domestic detail—”</p>
                    <p>“No, it can't wait,” said she, sitting down on the edge of the table, “and
                        it's not a variation on the domestic theme. It's the theme itself. Len—it's
                        all over!”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>What's</emph> all over?”</p>
                    <p>“Everything. She's going to leave.”</p>
                    <p>“Why?”</p>
                    <p>“I don't know. I was too upset to ask her. I just came to you.”</p>
                    <p>I resisted an impulse to put aside the six remunerative<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7142-106"/> munerative stories and spend the rest of the day
                        in consoling my wife.</p>
                    <p>“I don't know what it is. We've been nice to her, I'm sure! She likes us—at
                        least I thought she did. It's Destiny—it's like Maeterlinck—whatever we do
                        turns out all anyhow. There's a curse upon us!”</p>
                    <p>“Speak for yourself,” I said, cheerfully. “You may be cursed, though it's
                        barely polite of you to say so, but I am blessed above all that live, I'm
                        blessed if I'm not—since you—”</p>
                    <p>She stamped her foot. “Don't you see,” she said, “it's serious, horribly
                        serious? I wish I had never come here. I wish we were back in the
                        Bandbox—there! Now crow over me, and tell me you told me so all the
                        time!”</p>
                    <p>I told her something quite different, and presently, when we were calmer, I
                        said,</p>
                    <p>“At least we may as well know why she's going.”</p>
                    <p>“I'll ask her,” said Chloe, drying her eyes. “It's probably Prosser. If I
                        were you I should just take him by the shoulders and turn him out. You're
                        quite strong enough.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, and have an action for assault and a hundred pounds' damages,” said I,
                        wise with the wisdom of my solicitor. “Go and ask her. Perhaps it's not
                        Prosser. Even he, fiend without<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7142-107"/> out
                        references as he is, can't be responsible for everything. Perhaps she's seen
                        the ghost.”</p>
                    <p>I had completed a fancy sketch of Mary giving notice, and alleging her
                        reasons by unmistakable gestures indicating the ghost, in the background,
                        when Chloe returned.</p>
                    <p>“Well?” said I.</p>
                    <p>“Well?” said she.</p>
                    <p>“Have you found out?”</p>
                    <p>“It's all right,” said Chloe, with a sigh of deep relief. “<emph>We</emph>
                        haven't done anything. She is awfully fond of us—but she <emph>must</emph>
                        go.”</p>
                    <p>“Why?”</p>
                    <p>“She's going to marry the baker.”</p>
                    <p>“Lucky man!”</p>
                    <p>“It's a love-affair,” said Chloe—“the prettiest story. They couldn't marry
                        before because he wasn't well enough off, and now an uncle has left him some
                        money, and he's bought a partnership.”</p>
                    <p>“And how long have they been waiting for each other? How many long years of
                        priceless constancy, tried like gold in the furnace?”</p>
                    <p>“That's the worst of it,” said Chloe, blushing, as I live; “she's only known
                        him for a month. But servants are expeditious as the wind in matters of the
                        heart.”</p>
                    <p>“Charles Reade: <title>Hard Cash</title>—yes. Well, it's hard on
                            <emph>us</emph>.”</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7142-108"/>
                    <p>“But it's very nice for <emph>them</emph>,” said my wife. “You ought to feel
                        ever so much sympathy with lovers!”</p>
                    <p>“I do,” said I, “especially when they are married and live in a house miles
                        too big for them.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len,” she said, “are you really so very sorry for yourself?”</p>
                    <p>“I am just as sorry for myself as you are for me.”</p>
                    <p>“And I'm just as sorry for you as you can possibly be for yourself. Where had
                        we got to?”</p>
                    <p>“We had got to Mary's marrying the baker, and your not minding being left
                        without a servant because of your admiration for the beauty of constant
                        love.”</p>
                    <p>“Let's go into the garden and finish talking about it.”</p>
                    <p>“I could talk all day about love and constancy,” said I, “but my story—”</p>
                    <p>“Bother the story!” said she, “and it's not love I want to talk about, unless
                        you can't keep off the subject. It's advertisements, and registry-offices,
                        and Prosser.”</p>
                    <p>So we went into the garden and talked.</p>
                    <p>The garden chooses one's subjects for one, and it would not listen to any of
                        Chloe's subjects. It was more tolerant of mine.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE LOAFERY</head>
                    <p><hi>I WAS</hi> writing in the red-and-white marble hall that morning—I really
                        had made a beginning on the first of the six stories. It was not a good
                        beginning, but there it was. I had reached page three, and knew that unless
                        any domestic event more than commonly cataclysmic befell that day I should
                        see the sun set on twelve pages of laborious type-writing.</p>
                    <p>The walls of the marble hall are thick, and the windows look to the
                        northeast, so that even when the sun is turning the garden to fine gold, and
                        the westerly rooms to a burning, fiery furnace, the hall remains cool as a
                        cave. Through the open door I could see the feathery flowers of the Spanish
                        chestnut; through one window I could see the copper-beech, wine-dark, and
                        through the other a gap in the avenue showed me a square of blue sky backing
                        a single pillar of Normandy poplar, straight, slender, self-<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7142-110"/> possessed. The garden was full of bird noises and
                        the faint rustle of leaves. In the kitchen sounded the clink of silver—of
                        electro-plate, to be more accurate—and the chime of china. The tapping of my
                        Remington hardly did more than underline a silence which it might have
                        broken to an ear that loved its monotonous music less than did mine.</p>
                    <p>The hall is the great highway of the Red House. Chloe passed through now and
                        then with duster and broom, with an armful of blue-frilled cushions, with a
                        folded rug, with something that rattled in a covered waste-paper basket. She
                        looked at me, and I knew she was wondering why I did not ask her what she
                        was playing at. But I forbore, because I had reached the fourth page, and I
                        dared not tempt fate by pausing to enjoy more deeply the charm of a life my
                        right to which I ought, without doubt, even at that moment to be earning.
                        Besides, I feared to break the spell. When once the fatal third page is
                        passed fluency holds her own against ordinary attacks. Not against Chloe, if
                        one allows her to begin to explain a new idea. Yet my fingers worked more
                        slowly, and my full stops gave me time to count forty instead of four, as
                        they tell us to do at school, just because I could not either resist or
                        understand a growing impression<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7142-111"/> pression
                        that my wife did not want me to ask any questions. Had I felt that it would
                        please her to be questioned. I could have wrestled with the definite
                        temptation to please her, and have thrown it. As it was, my phrases grew
                        feebler, my narrative less convincing. I had to clutch with both hands at my
                        vanishing interest in my story; and when the struggle was over I found that
                        I had complicated the career of my hero with two wives, a dissipated youth,
                        and a proposed highway robbery. And my hero was intended to shine in a
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">milieu</foreign> of “strong domestic
                        interest.”</p>
                    <p>I gathered the pages together; it was lunchtime. The blue and gold of the
                        morning were overclouded with thick gray; the sky looked like the canvas
                        roof of a travelling-circus tent. A few first drops made splashes on the
                        door-step big as five-shilling pieces. Then down came the rain—straight,
                        strong, masterful.</p>
                    <p>“I knew it was going to rain,” said Chloe. “How good it is to hear it! Don't
                        you feel almost as glad of it as if you were a tree? Fancy standing up to it
                        and holding out all your leaves to feel the splash of it!”</p>
                    <p>“It makes work easier,” I said. “Now you can't entice me away from my stories
                        and tempt me to waste the golden hours in the garden.”</p>
                    <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7142-112"/>
                    <p>“That's the worst of this house,” she said—“everything inside it urges to
                        industry. The white parlor is so proper, I never sit in it without feeling
                        that I ought to be doing open-work embroidery, if not working a sampler.
                        What heaps of work we shall do in the winter when there's no dear garden to
                        tempt us!”</p>
                    <p>“I wonder—”</p>
                    <p>It was Chloe who talked just then. I was trying to keep a few tentacles fixed
                        on my story, and I was determined that I would ask no questions. After lunch
                        I said:</p>
                    <p>“Coffee?”</p>
                    <p>“It's not ready yet,” said she, rising. Then, “Len,” she said, abruptly,
                        “I've got something to show you.”</p>
                    <p>“ Not more rabbits?” I said, for only the week before it had been six baby
                        rabbits that she had to show, found in our orchard, and painfully fed by
                        Chloe, with the finger of a white kid glove dipped in warm milk. The rabbits
                        had not lived.</p>
                    <p>“No, no—how can you remind me of that? Come.”</p>
                    <p>She led me up the oak stairs, along the gallery, and up a further narrower
                        flight. We were among the nest of deserted rooms on the second floor. Chloe
                        threw open a door, pulled me through, and shut it quickly.</p>
                    <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7142-113"/>
                    <p>It was a large room, swept and cleaned; three long windows, curtained with
                        cascades of Virginia-creeper, filled it with soft green twilight.</p>
                    <p>There were no ornaments, there were no easy-chairs, there were no flowers and
                        no carpets. Only one Persian rug on the floor, and a great divan, twelve or
                        fourteen feet long, against one of the walls. On the shelves in the recesses
                        by the fireplace were some thirty books, a large deal table held a solid
                        inkstand, a smaller deal table held a brass tray with cups and tins. Two
                        Windsor chairs stood against the big table.</p>
                    <p>“Now I'll make coffee,” she said, turning to the brass tray.</p>
                    <p>“Coffee seems very flat. Is it possible that you aren't going to satisfy my
                        raging curiosity? What <emph>is</emph> this room?”</p>
                    <p>“It's the loafery,” she said. “In the winter, as you say, we shall need a
                        place to loaf in.”</p>
                    <p>“I didn't say so.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, you did. Try the divan.”</p>
                    <p>I did. It crackled when I sat down, but it was very comfortable.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe,” I said, “come here!”</p>
                    <p>“I can't. I'm making the coffee.” And indeed she had lighted the spirit-lamp
                        to that end.</p>
                    <p>“Do you know that you are blushing as though<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7142-114"/> you had been detected in pocket-picking, or in some generous act? Why are
                        you embarrassed? Why are you shy? Why do you screen yourself behind a
                        spirit-lamp? Why have you done this? And why don't you rush into my arms as
                        a dutiful wife should, and confess how you came to have such a beautiful
                        idea?”</p>
                    <p>“You <emph>do</emph> like it, then?”</p>
                    <p>“Like it? I protest, by all my household gods, that if I had been a bachelor
                        inhabiting this house, thus, and in no other way, should I have furnished my
                        living-room!”</p>
                    <p>“Why ‘if you were a bachelor’?”</p>
                    <p>“Because my wife likes pretty things. She likes green Flemish pots, and brass
                        warming-pans, and Sheffield-plate candlesticks, and flowers; and, as a
                        husband, I like what she likes. Chloe, why are there no flowers here?”</p>
                    <p>She pointed to the green screen of leaves at the window.</p>
                    <p>I got up and began to walk up and down.</p>
                    <p>“You're a witch,” said I. “How did you know exactly what I liked? Here is
                        space—nothing to knock down! And form—no curtains to break the fine lines of
                        these old windows. And color—look at the green light; it's like a fairy
                        palace lighted by glowworm-lamps, especially when that gleam of sunlight
                        came! Chloe,<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7142-115"/> how did you know? Is it
                        because you love me very much?”</p>
                    <p>“Not in the least,” she said, briskly. “It's because—Len, don't laugh at me—I
                        knew how to do the room because it's what <emph>I</emph> like,
                            <emph>too</emph>!”</p>
                    <p>She had made the coffee and poured it out. Then she came and took my arm.
                        Outside the rain pattered pleasantly on the green leaves and on the roof of
                        the balcony.</p>
                    <p>“That's why I felt silly and why I blushed—only, of course, I never did
                        blush. I seem to be turning into somebody else, and perhaps you won't like
                        me so much. Or I'm half myself and half somebody else, and I don't know
                        which half is really you. It didn't cost anything, hardly,” she went on,
                        irrelevantly. “The divan is only orange-boxes filled with straw, and covered
                        with those old green curtains—you know—the ones that were so faded. And the
                        table is out of the kitchen—the two shelves that pull out are quite enough
                        there, Mary says. And that's all.”</p>
                    <p>We sat down among the blue-frilled cushions. “I bought the stuff for these,
                        of course—the green twirlies on them just match the old curtains,” she said.
                        “And that really <emph>is</emph> all.”</p>
                    <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7142-116"/>
                    <p>“Honest Injun?” I said, severely.</p>
                    <p>“Oh,” she said, tossing her head, “if you think I really did it to please
                            <emph>you</emph>—”</p>
                    <p>“But tell me, then,” I pleaded.</p>
                    <p>“I don't know,” she said, confusedly, resting her elbows on her knees and her
                        head in her hands. “You see, the Red House is so big. It's like Shakespeare
                        or Goethe, and the Bandbox was like Savoy opera. And I hate mixing things
                        up. And then it is so awful to have to dust things! Wasn't it Thoreau who
                        threw away his curios because he couldn't be bothered to dust them? And
                        Mary's going, and I thought if one could have a room with just only what one
                        needed—a lounge, a table, two chairs—we can put more books if you like. But
                        I thought—if you would—we needn't use it only for loafing; we could bring
                        anything we liked here—work or anything; but I thought if you would agree
                        never to <emph>leave</emph> anything here, but take everything away when
                        we'd done it, whatever it was, then we should always have one room tidy—at
                        least the untidiness would never be more than one day deep. It's letting the
                        litter of the days overlap that makes everything so hopeless. And I thought,
                        perhaps, I should get some work done here.”</p>
                    <p>“You are a genius,” I said, “and I am Prince<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7142-117"/> Fortunate. I only regret one thing, and that is, that I did not think of
                        it myself.”</p>
                    <p>“If you had you wouldn't have done it,” she said, quickly—“that's just it.
                        Because you thought I—and so I did—but— Anyway, you're pleased?”</p>
                    <p>“I am.”</p>
                    <p>“The odd thing is that I think I must be two people, because if I had heaps
                        of servants I should have the green pottery and brass and things in every
                        room but this. Len, since we came to live here everything seems different. I
                        feel as if I were swimming for my life in a great sea—nothing's the same as
                        I used to think it was.”</p>
                    <p>“Nothing?”</p>
                    <p>“Only us. I wonder if you understand—”</p>
                    <p>“My dear,” I said, “we've tumbled out of our doll's house into the real
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, this isn't the real world—it's too nice.”</p>
                    <p>“Into a new world, then—a world where we have to think for ourselves and
                        judge things on their merits. We're like Columbus, madam. The really
                        important thing is to find out for one's self, without any sort of mistake,
                        what are the things one cares about—the things that matter—”</p>
                    <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7142-118"/>
                    <p>“And the things one doesn't care about—those are much more important—the
                        things one has just because other people have them—at least, if that's not
                        the reason I don't know what is. And we've so much to learn, and there are
                        so many good qualities I know nothing about. Don't you feel very poor and
                        unimportant, Len? And very, very ignorant? I do.”</p>
                    <p>“I know one or two important things,” said I, for I never encourage Chloe in
                        the moods of humility that end in self-reproaches, “and I have one or two
                        unimportant possessions—the Red House, and a wife, and a loafery. See, the
                        sun is coming out in earnest; how glorious it is through the green! Oh, it's
                        a good world, when all's said and done! How thick the creeper grows. What
                        does it hang by? Why, there are bars! This must have been the nursery.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said Chloe, leaning her chin on my shoulder, as she stood behind
                        me.</p>
                    <p>“It would make a splendid nursery, too,” said I.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said my wife again, still with her chin on my shoulder. “Len, I feel
                        very silly indeed, to-day; I should like to say something stupid.”</p>
                    <p>“You couldn't offer me a greater novelty.”</p>
                    <p>She slipped her hand into my arm, and laid her cheek against my coat
                        sleeve.</p>
                    <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7142-119"/>
                    <p>“You know you thought it was so mad of me wanting to come to the Red House,
                        but I saw these bars that very first day, and I thought how nice it would be
                        for them to have a beautiful place to remember when they grow up. Not to
                        remember the people next door, and organ-grinders, and gritty dust, and
                        pavements, but quietness and big green trees and lawns, and this grave old
                        house. Don't you think it would be nice for them?”</p>
                    <p>“For them?” I said, not because I did not understand.</p>
                    <p>“For—if ever we had any children, Len.”</p>
                    <p>Some day, if we live, we shall be old and gray, feeble, and look back with
                        dim eyes along a lane of years; and even then that good moment will stand
                        out golden and perfect—the moment when, strong in youth and love and hope,
                        we stood together, looking out together through the nursery bars and the
                        green creeper towards the years to come. The summer day when, if our eyes
                        were dim, it was with the dew of morning, when, if our hands trembled, it
                        was because they held such full measure of life's good things.</p>
                    <p>Chloe raised her head suddenly. “I told you I was silly,” she said, “but
                        since I <emph>am</emph> silly I'll say one silly thing more. I don't think
                        any one in this world was ever so happy as I am.<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7142-120"/> And when I get worried and cross, you know—Oh,
                        why am I saying all the things that you know perfectly, and that one doesn't
                        say? You must get back to your work, and I'll try to do that drawing of the
                        duke. And to-night we'll have a consultation about Mary. Yolande shall
                        advise us.”</p>
                    <p>That evening when Yolande and my wife were deep in a discussion on the way in
                        which a really right-minded dressmaker should cut a skirt, I strolled into
                        the new room, and there on the table was Chloe's drawing of the duke and the
                        humble companion. The duke's arm was wrong, so were his Grace's legs. Pencil
                        and India-rubber lay near. I fingered an H.B. absently for a moment, and
                        presently found myself seated at the table, elbows squared, head bent,
                        working up the duke to the semblance of something human. I always took the
                        drawing prize in my youth—nothing to boast of, since, proverbially, it falls
                        to “the greatest muff in the school”—and at Oxford I had taken a keen
                        pleasure in caricaturing those who sit in the seats of the mighty, and in
                        idealizing those who stand behind the counters of the pastry-cook. Also, in
                        the days when I dreamed legal dreams in the Temple, and spent my idle days
                        in the law courts, I had made constant use of<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7142-121"/> the excellent quills and stationery provided by
                        the state, to draw portraits of the leading legal lights. And I could see
                        the shapes of things. I knew how the arm should go. I knew also how a man's
                        clothes hang when he is in them, which Chloe never could grasp. So I rubbed
                        out most of her duke, and put in a duke of my own—quite a flesh-and-blood
                        creature, and a great deal too good for Chloe's presentment of the humble
                        companion, with whose carefully arranged draperies I did not venture to
                        meddle. I touched up the background a little, correcting the wild
                        perspective of a console-table—an article of furniture which had apparently
                        struck Chloe as ducal—slipped the drawing under its sheet of tissue-paper,
                        and went off to confess to my wife what I had done.</p>
                    <p>But I found her up to her ears in sleeves and yokes, and it seemed simpler to
                        make Yolande play the piano in the great drawing-room, and sit beside Chloe
                        in the twilight, and think of many things, only now and then wondering
                        vaguely how she would meet the discovery of my presumptuous iniquity.</p>
                    <p>We had agreed that we would allow Miss Richborough an evening's repose—a
                        night's rest—before laying upon her the burden of our cares—our drunken
                        tenant and our angel servant,<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7142-122"/> so soon to
                        be translated to a sphere far from our deep need of her. And the evening
                        passed pleasantly enough. Yolande had brought half a dozen sketch-books with
                        her, filled with little notes of her Italian tour. She really draws rather
                        well; and even when her drawings are incorrect, they are amusing. Chloe and
                        I laughed and criticised, but no one said anything worth recording. The
                        really noteworthy remark was made next morning by Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len,” she said, coming to me, with the duke and the humble companion in
                        her hands, “look what she—I mean, look what the ghost has done! Oh, what a
                        clever ghost to be able to draw and write better—I mean as well as we
                        can!”</p>
                    <p>I would not have believed that she could be so deceived. Yolande's drawing is
                        absolutely different from mine; she has a sense of humor, but she is wholly
                        lacking in any real feeling for line. Yet Chloe could believe that my duke
                        was Yolande's work! I told myself that I felt humbled, but really I felt a
                        proud, if chastened, indignation.</p>
                    <p>“It is indeed a ghost in a thousand!” I said. “Shall you send the drawing
                        in?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course!” she said, opening wide eyes at me. “And I only wish the ghost
                        would illustrate<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7142-123"/> trate that hateful fairy
                        tale for the <title>Children's Globe</title>.”</p>
                    <p>I determined that the ghost should do this, too, or I would know the reason
                        why.</p>
                    <p>“And now,” said Chloe, “we must hold a council of war.”</p>
                    <p>We took Yolande and showed her our own new room—our loafery—and then we asked
                        her whether she would prefer to hold the council there, or in the white
                        parlor where her settle and bureau were, or under the cedars where the
                        hammock hung, and where the grass would be dry in spite of yesterday's rain.
                        We waited breathlessly for her answer. She stood at the door of our new
                        room, and looked round it, an appreciation in her eyes before which our own
                        dropped. Then she said:</p>
                    <p>“Not here, anyway; this is your very own room. I should feel as uncomfortable
                        in it as I should in your boots, Len, or in Chloe's gold-rimmed eye-glasses.
                        I vote for the cedars.”</p>
                    <p>We each said, “Nonsense!” but we went down the stairs, each holding one of
                        her kind hands. No one but Yolande would have understood. I wondered whether
                        she had noticed the window-bars.</p>
                    <p>So it was under the cedars that we pointed out to Yolande the overflowing
                        measure of our personal<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7142-124"/> sonal
                        embarrassments. The migration of Mary, the weed-choked garden, the
                        impossible tenants, the empty cottages which our one experience made us fear
                        any thought of letting. And Yolande listened with the deepest sympathy, and
                        the shadows of the cedar dappled her green gown and stole the light from her
                        red-gold hair.</p>
                    <p>“Can you do anything?” said Chloe at last, desperately breaking through Miss
                        Richborough's guard of noncommittal condolence.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose I could offer to stay and help you to wash and spin, and bake and
                        brew,” she said, “but I'm not effectual. And, besides, it would be like
                        cutting firewood with a razor.”</p>
                    <p>“Your modesty was always your strong point, my dear Razor,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“A razor is not fitted for chopping firewood,” said Yolande, demurely, “and
                        it is fitted for other things. If you cut firewood with it it can't do its
                        own proper work that it was made for. And if I may just hit out once
                        brutally and straight from the shoulder, I will relieve my mind and not hurt
                        you very much.”</p>
                    <p>“Strike here,” said my wife, with her hands to her heart.</p>
                    <p>“May I? Thanks, awfully. Well, then, you all-round people, who can turn your
                        hand to anything, you're always chopping firewood with razors<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7142-125"/> zors; you're always diverting your energies from
                        their proper channel, and doing a dozen people's work indifferent well,
                        because you haven't time to do it properly. Len cleans boots and door-steps
                        and candlesticks, and comes to his real work with only half a heart; Chloe
                        can't do her drawing comfortably, because she has sweeping and dusting and
                        cooking to see to. A really reasonable Len, a truly conscientious Chloe,
                        would work at its own trade, and hire other people to work at theirs. I have
                        spoken.”</p>
                    <p>“Poor fox!” said Chloe, softly; “were the nasty grapes sour, then?”</p>
                    <p>“I will not pretend,” Miss Richborough said, severely, “to misunderstand your
                        allusion. I am not an accomplished sweeper. I dust ill and rarely. When I
                        wash up I always break a cup or a plate. I dare say I should clean a boot
                        with whitening, or a front door-step with Globe polish.”</p>
                    <p>“And yet, by your own confession, you love to have your finger in your
                        neighbor's pies.”</p>
                    <p>“Exactly; I like to do what I am fitted for. I can adjust my neighbor's pies
                        better than any professional pastry-cook. And adjusting pies doesn't
                        interfere with my regular work—that's the point.”</p>
                    <p>“But we <emph>like</emph> doing things in the house,” Chloe ventured.</p>
                    <pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7142-126"/>
                    <p>“Don't I know it? Oh, you needn't trouble to convince me of your depravity. I
                        stick to what I said. All these irons in the fire—yes, even that
                        contemptible little bit of garden that you've weeded—all take off from the
                        energy you ought to spend on your writing and drawing. You are both
                        exceedingly naughty children!”</p>
                    <p>“How,” I ventured, “in these circumstances would a really good child
                        behave?”</p>
                    <p>“It would not bite blades of grass, to begin with,” she said, “when it was
                        being lectured for its own good. And then look at your ruffianly tenant.
                        When one lets houses one employs an agent, and he insists on references. He
                        knows his business.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe looked appealingly at me, and I threw a daisy at her, and said:</p>
                    <p>“We were certainly wrong there.” Her eyes thanked me for the “we,” and
                        Yolande went on:</p>
                    <p>“Then as to servants, it would pay you to have a really good one, if you had
                        to pay her thirty or forty pounds a year. Don't open your pretty eyes at me,
                        Chloe—I mean it. You've always got far more work than you can do, as things
                        are now. If you really stick to your work you could well afford the wages of
                        a paragon.”</p>
                    <p>“Puzzle: to find the paragon,” said I.</p>
                    <pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7142-127"/>
                    <p>“Ah! that's where I come in. I can't wash dishes—anyway, I won't. But if
                        you'll give me a free hand I'll find you a servant as good as this Mary of
                        yours. I'll bet my <title>Omar Khayyam</title>, and it's a first edition,
                        you know, against your <title>Shropshire Lad</title>!”</p>
                    <p>“Done!” I said, instantly. “And what about the degraded Prosser?”</p>
                    <p>“One thing at a time,” said Yolande. “The question of the tenantry must stand
                        over till we've settled the problem of domestic service. Ah, don't talk to
                        me any more! My brain is teeming with the most fascinating ideas, as
                        brilliant as practicable. Let me alone while my schemes develop.” She leaned
                        back in the hammock among the yellow cushions, and in three minutes she was
                        fast asleep. Chloe and I stole away, through the garden to the seat under
                        the quince-tree.</p>
                    <p>“We <emph>are</emph> like babes in the wood,” she said. “I wonder whether
                        she'll succeed.”</p>
                    <p>“She always succeeds,” I said, shortly; “it's her métier. Ours, I suppose, is
                        that of these same babes—helplessness, appealing to the pity of all kindly
                        passers-by—and I own that it's not a métier I'm particularly proud of.”</p>
                    <p>“Yolande isn't every passer-by.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, she is,” I said, “every single one.”</p>
                    <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7142-128"/>
                    <p>“Dear,” said my wife, calmly, “you are very cross, and presently you will be
                        sorry.”</p>
                    <p>I had not been cross before—at least, I think not; but now, perhaps— I picked
                        an unripe quince and threw it at a blackbird on the ivy. I did not hit the
                        blackbird.</p>
                    <p>“Seriously,” said Chloe, catching at my hand as it sought another quince, “I
                        think Yolande's right. It's our métier to write and draw, and earn our
                        livings. We can't be clever enough to do everything. Why should we be too
                        proud to let her try to do what we haven't been able to do—get a servant who
                        will stay? You're not really vexed because Yolande said what she did? You
                        know how fond she is of us.”</p>
                    <p>“I only know I feel contemptible,” I said. “I ought to be able to manage
                        these things for myself.”</p>
                    <p>“Then shall I tell Yolande not to trouble? Len, how silly you are! What is
                        it?”</p>
                    <p>“I should have thought it would be more pleasant to you to think you'd
                        married a <emph>man</emph>, and not a babe in the wood.”</p>
                    <p>“You were manly enough in the Bandbox, but I didn't know then half how dear
                        you were. Oh, Len! don't you think it's nice to find out all sorts of things
                        together, even—”</p>
                    <p>“Even our babe-in-the-woodness?”</p>
                    <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7142-129"/>
                    <p>“Yes, even our limitations. Why should we want to pretend we can do
                        everything? We can do a great many things that Yolande can't do.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes—wash up, and sweep, and dust.”</p>
                    <p>“But you like doing them. And we can write and draw.”</p>
                    <p>“So can—so can the ghost. Dear, the black dog is on my back. You'd better go
                        away and leave me for a bit.”</p>
                    <p>Now Heaven be blessed for a wife who did not answer that appeal with an, “Oh,
                        darling, surely you don't want to be away from <emph>me</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>For one shameful instant I feared it. One does not learn everything about
                        one's wife even in ten married months.</p>
                    <p>As for Chloe, she kissed my forehead lightly, and without a word walked away
                        down the avenue of nut-trees. I watched her white skirt till the last sway
                        of it against the hollyhocks, and the moment she was out of sight I sprang
                        to my feet and ran after her. I came up with her by the bench of rotting
                        hives where once the bees followed their sweet industry. I caught her arm,
                        and she turned to me with a smile.</p>
                    <p>“Chloe, Chloe, I've put the nasty black dog up the chimney. I'm the happiest
                        man alive! I'm King of the Universe, and you're Queen!<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7142-130"/> Yolande doesn't belong to the reigning house.
                        Poor Yolande! we can't do less than let her be our vizier.”</p>
                    <p>I was holding her hands now, and we were looking at each other with that
                        unquenchable amazement which still comes to us at odd moments in life's
                        winding way—amazement that there should be in this world two people so
                        suited to each other as we; and the further wonder at the clemency of a fate
                        which has allowed us to find each other. This, I suppose, is a lover's
                        commonplace. It was our abiding marvel.</p>
                    <p>During the next week Yolande worked a good deal in her room, bicycled a
                        little with me, went to town once or twice with Chloe, and entirely won the
                        heart of Mary, who stated publicly that she would lie down for Miss Yo to
                        walk on if it would please her. Twice in that week the ghost walked. It
                        finished a story for me, and I wished it would mind its own business. But I
                        had been positively shocked to find myself capable of a feeling towards
                        Yolande that was very like jealousy, and just because I knew deep in my
                        heart that the ghost's work was better than my own, I felt that it was
                        equally impossible for me to insist on an explanation, or to refuse to send
                        in the ghost's work as mine. I had given<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7142-131"/>
                        away my ignoble secret to Chloe now, and I could not dare to sink further in
                        her eyes. So I sent in the ghost's work, and the editor was delighted. The
                        pricking of that same jealousy stung me to correct two of Chloe's drawings
                        and to originate a third. It was balm to me to hear Chloe's raptures over
                        the drawings, and to know that she believed them to be the work of
                        Yolande—Yolande, who could not have done anything half so good to save her
                        life.</p>
                    <p>It was on the evening before Mary's wedding. I had presented to her a neat
                        service of teacups and saucers, and Chloe had embroidered for her a
                        tea-cloth and a collar. I almost think she had sewn tears into the pretty
                        pattern. Mary had thanked me for my gifts and for my heartfelt expressions
                        of grief at parting from her, but it was not till Chloe presented her gifts
                        worked by her own hands that Mary broke down.</p>
                    <p>“I ain't a-going to leave you, mum,” she sobbed. “Miss Yo she told me not to
                        say nothing, so as to make it a regular surprise for you when I come back.
                        I'm only going for a week along of my Jim to see his father and mother down
                        Marden way, and then I'm coming back. Miss Yo told me you'd told her to
                        arrange what she liked.”</p>
                    <pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7142-132"/>
                    <p>“But your Jim,” said Chloe, aghast, “what will he say?”</p>
                    <p>“He's only too pleased, mum.”</p>
                    <p>“Only too pleased? Not to live with his wife?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, mum,” said Mary, giggling through her tears, “Miss Yo arranged it all.
                        Him and me is to have all the rooms beyond the kitchen. He's got a beautiful
                        lot of furniture as come to him from his aunt at Canterbury. He won't be in
                        no one's way, mum, being out so much, and I'm to do for you just the same as
                        ever; and I am so glad as never was, for I couldn't abide the notion of
                        leaving you, mum, and you putting roses in my bedroom and all, as if I was
                        the Queen, and now working those things for me with your own pretty
                        hands!”</p>
                    <p>When I came in a moment later I found Mary and Chloe in each other's arms,
                        and I am not sure but that they were both crying a little.</p>
                    <p>It was a simple solution, wasn't it? Yet Chloe and I had never thought of it.
                        And I had lost my <title>Shropshire Lad</title>.</p>

                    <head type="sub">YOLANDE'S REASONING</head>
                    <p><hi>MARY'S</hi> wedding was to be a quiet one. Her Jim brought a dejected
                        young carpenter with him, to be his “backer,” as he explained, and we all
                        walked up to the church in the village, where I was to give away the bride,
                        while Yolande officiated as bridesmaid. Chloe merely attended, as she
                        explained, to see fair play. The ceremony was fixed for Sunday afternoon,
                        and when we arrived at the church we were somewhat disconcerted to find a
                        large congregation. Mary and Jim had not any desire to hide the light of
                        their love-match under a bushel. “We ain't ashamed of it, mum,” she said, in
                        a hollow whisper, answering Chloe's agonized glance in the church porch.
                        “I've been reading about it in the prayer-book, and it says, ‘In the face of
                        this congregation,’ and that means afore a churchful. We 'ain't got no
                        friends here to ask, so we thought we'd have it done after<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7142-135"/> service, so as to be sure of the congregation
                        anyway.”</p>
                    <p>The congregation looked at us with interest. There was no mistaking Mary's
                        gray cashmere dress—a wedding-garment, if ever there was one—trimmed with
                        lavish indiscrimination and white cotton lace. And even if the gown had left
                        any room for doubt the orange flowers in her brown hat and in the blue bow
                        at her neck must have enlightened the least observant. Chloe and Yolande, in
                        pale muslins, looked quite as bridal as the bride, and Jim and his “backer”
                        and I each looked uncomfortable enough to have been the bridegroom. The
                        verger recognized us unerringly as the wedding-party, and showed us to a pew
                        near the chancel, where we remained till the service was over. I had faintly
                        hoped that the congregation would be glad to get out—the thermometer must
                        have been about a hundred in the shade—but Mary had judged better than I;
                        not a soul moved, and she was married “in the face of this congregation,” as
                        she had wished and intended.</p>
                    <p>The clergyman was old and short-sighted—he could not see the orange blossoms,
                        I suppose. At any rate, I found it quite difficult to prevent him from
                        marrying Yolande, in her muslin and Valenciennes and her big white hat with
                            the<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7142-136"/> ostrich feathers, to the backer,
                        whose white buttonhole was, I admit, twice as big and twice as bridal as
                        Jim's.</p>
                    <p>However, the verger backed me up, and the right couple were married, at last.
                        We all went back to the Red House and drank the health of the happy pair—in
                        Asti, though, not in champagne—because Asti is twice as cheap and twice as
                        nice. At least, Chloe says so.</p>
                    <p>Then we saw them off at the station. Then we came home and tore off our
                        smart, hot clothes, and got into flannels or muslin wrappers, and got our
                        own tea—at least, Chloe and I did—and drank it under the cedars.</p>
                    <p>When tea was over, Chloe said, maliciously, “Wouldn't you like to wash up the
                        cups, Yolande?”</p>
                    <p>“Your cups are, I believe, Spode—or is it only Spode and Copeland? Shall I
                        wash up? I warn you that I cannot answer for my fingers. They lose their
                        grasp if I become interested in my own reflections—or, yes—or in the
                        conversation of others, so it's no use offering to talk to me while I do it.
                        I know my limitations, and I abide by them.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>I'm</emph> not proud of <emph>my</emph> limitations,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“No, dear,” Yolande answered, sweetly; “that's<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7142-137"/> because you haven't any. Why don't you get some?
                        They are a great convenience.”</p>
                    <p>“You speak as though one could decide one's limitations for one's self.”</p>
                    <p>“And can't one? A clever woman like you—”</p>
                    <p>“No butter, thanks,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“—Like you could do anything that silly women can do, and could do any one
                        thing she gave her whole mind to, better than these silly women. But no one
                        can do everything. When you've found that out, and decided what you want to
                        do, you've learned your limitations.”</p>
                    <p>“You mean,” I said, “that you could wash dishes with the best, and sweep and
                        dust <foreign xml:lang="ger">und so weiter</foreign>, if you only cared
                        to?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course I could”—Yolande opened her lovely eyes—“I could do anything I
                        gave my mind to. But I haven't a hundred minds to give to a hundred
                        industries. When I was quite a child I declined to be taught to sew. I saw,
                        even then, that one's knowledge of feminine crafts is just a weapon in the
                        hands of the evil one, who lies in wait at every corner to keep one off
                        one's real work. I meant to go to Girton: so when they made me wash up the
                        tea-things, I always dropped something. They soon left off asking me to wash
                        up.”</p>
                    <p>“How horribly immoral!”</p>

                    <p>“Not at all. I only enforced my decision by concrete arguments—the only ones
                        my aunt could understand. The secret of success is to know what you want and
                        what you don't want.”</p>
                    <p>I looked at Chloe—we had said the same thing in almost the same words but the
                        other day.</p>
                    <p>“Do you suppose,” Yolande went on, “that I should have taken every prize in
                        each form all the way up the school, and then got a scholarship at Girton,
                        if I had allowed myself to be taught to dust the drawing-room and to make my
                        own dresses, and sew on buttons and darn stockings for the boys?”</p>
                    <p>“I don't know,” said Chloe; “perhaps mathematics take more time than drawing.
                        Anyway, I liked learning the things you despise, and I liked doing them. I
                        liked helping mother. I like playing with my own house.”</p>
                    <p>“Helping Len—yes—perhaps it would be different. You see, I never had a
                        mother. If I had had, I dare say I should have learned all these arts, just
                        so as to be able to do something for her when she wanted it. But, as it was,
                        I set myself to do a man's work, and I tried to live a man's life—apart from
                        these little worries. And what's more, I succeeded. There's not a feminine
                        trait about me, thank Heaven.”</p>
                    <p>We all three laughed. Chloe said:</p>
                    <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7142-139"/>
                    <p>“Take down your pretty hair, Yolande. I want to look at it.”</p>
                    <p>The wide, lace-ruffled sleeves fell back from her creamy, rounded arms where
                        the gold bangles shone. I could see the diamonds and sapphires and opals of
                        her rings gleaming among the copper-gold of her hair as she drew out the
                        silver filigree-topped hair-pins. Then the coils of bright hair began to
                        fall over the delicate silk muslin of her gown till she stood before us
                        clothed in a glowing mantle that fell below her knees. She threw her long
                        hair back, with a quintessentially feminine gesture, and came and sat beside
                        Chloe on the grass, where her hair curled and coiled on the ground, like
                        swirls of surf on the edge of a sea lit by sunset. We looked at her—bright
                        hair, bright bangles, bright rings, bright eyes—and we said together,</p>
                    <p>“No feminine traits!”</p>
                    <p>“That's not a feminine trait,” she answered, elliptically. “Even a man tries
                        to look as nice as he can. It's not much he can do—but he does it. Look at
                        men's ties. They use thousands of them, and nobody ever notices what they
                        wear, any more than any one ever notices whether women wear threes or fours
                        in shoes. Yet most women pinch their feet and their waists.”</p>
                    <p>“Men notice waists, anyhow,” said Chloe.<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7142-140"/>
                        “If Len sees a girl pinched in so that you wonder she doesn't snap off
                        short, he says, ‘There's a smart girl.’”</p>
                    <p>“We are wandering from the point,” I said, hastily.</p>
                    <p>“Which, by-the-way, is that this very evening as ever is I'm off to my club,”
                        said Yolande, briskly. “I will not be taught to do house-work, and I love
                        you both far too much not to fall an easy victim to your arts if I were to
                        see you really in need of help. I can't abjure the creed of a lifetime. My
                        only safety is in flight. When Mary comes back I'll come back, too, if
                        you'll have me. I can't stay here and see the dark side of Mary's
                        honey-moon. And meantime you'll give me leave to let my master-mind play
                        round the question of your horrible tenant. Did you notice his front garden
                        as we came back from church? By-the-way, why did you never tell me your
                        church has a Norman chancel?”</p>
                    <p>“We didn't know it ourselves,” said Chloe. “You see, we've always been to
                        Westenden church. It's a lovely walk through the woods in the evening.
                        Perhaps among the other things you declined to learn you escaped the
                        knowledge that after you've moved into a new house your first appearance in
                        your parish church is a signal that you are ready for your neighbors to call
                            on<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7142-141"/> you? Well, we didn't want them to
                        call on us.”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps they will now, mum, thanking you for your slap about my ignorance of
                        pretty manners.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no,” said Chloe, “our appearance there was unofficial. Any one could see
                        that.”</p>
                    <p>“I'm not sure—but I wish you luck,” said Yolande. “And now I must tear myself
                        away.”</p>
                    <p>“Selfish thing,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“Not selfish, sweetheart! Only faithful, in the face of tremendous
                        temptation, to the ideals of a lifetime.”</p>
                    <p>“When you marry,” said my wife, impressively, “your husband will be a poor
                        little hen-pecked thing.”</p>
                    <p>“I shall never marry. I never met but one man who was nice enough for a
                        husband, and he was only nice enough for you—not nearly nice enough for me.
                        Now I've involved you both in the ruins of a compliment, and I'll go.”</p>
                    <p>She went.</p>
                    <p>I own that it was with an invigorating sense of something pleasant promised
                        that I awoke next morning. The feeling deepened as I stole down-stairs and
                        lighted the kitchen fire. Mary—may her honey-moon last her life long!—had
                        dried a little stack of wood and piled it in the<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7142-142"/> wash-house ready for us. I filled the kettle,
                        swept up the hearth, and had finished laying the cloth for breakfast when
                        Chloe appeared.</p>
                    <p>I do not know which of us most enjoyed the house-work that followed. Chloe
                        loves house-work for its own sake. As she says, it is play, because it is
                        not what one ought to be doing. For myself, I admit that when I see my wife
                        working about the house I experience a more intimate sense of possession
                        even than when I walk with her in the garden, hand in hand, and certainly
                        far deeper than I can ever feel when she is drawing away for dear life to
                        add her share to our income. Theoretically I know how right and proper it is
                        that she should earn money as well as I. Practically I want to earn all the
                        money, and to let her spend it. This is the relic of a barbarous age, and so
                        is the delightful thrill of domestic pleasure with which I see
                            <emph>my</emph> wife busy about <emph>our</emph> house. At the same time
                        I like to prove to her that I can sweep and dust and wash up as well as she
                        can, if not better. The only drawback to our happiness that morning was
                        Mary's neatness and cleanness, which left us little or nothing to do. When
                        all her necessary work was done, I noted still a hungry look in Chloe's
                        eye.</p>
                    <p>“What, Oliver! Asking for more?”</p>
                    <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7142-143"/>
                    <p>“Yes, Mr. Bumble. I'll get lunch now—and then you must go and write, and I'll
                        put on my very oldest rags and clean out the china-cupboard.”</p>
                    <p>Her oldest rags were the red-and-white Trouville petticoat and a blue,
                        long-sleeved painting pinafore. I left her with bare feet, and sleeves
                        rolled up to the shoulder, carrying the piles of china into the hall.</p>
                    <p>“I shall scrub the shelves first,” she said; “you know I've never let Mary
                        touch it—she's never even seen it unlocked—so it's all as black as ink. And
                        then I'll wash the floor, and then I'll wash the china and put it all back
                        after I've cleaned the window.”</p>
                    <p>“Let me clean the window,” I said.</p>
                    <p>“No, not for the world. I'm going to enjoy myself. I'm going to play, I
                        am—I'm going to fritter away my intellect, as Yolande says. And you're going
                        to enjoy the dignity of labor, and do what you are really fitted for. Lucky
                        boy!”</p>
                    <p>“If you taunt me with my chains I won't pull an oar at all in this
                        galley.”</p>
                    <p>“Where are you going to work?”</p>
                    <p>“In the loafery. It's the only place where I can even begin to be moderately
                        contented away from you.”</p>
                    <p>“What a pretty speech! You shall bring me<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7142-144"/>
                        two pails of water for a reward. One hot and one cold. Len, why do you like
                        the loafery so much?”</p>
                    <p>“I like the bars,” said I, coming nearer to her.</p>
                    <p>My exercise with broom, mop, and the other implements of domestic industry
                        seemed rather to have brightened my brain than to have dulled it. My story
                        went very well. I had a good plot which Yolande had suggested, and the
                        type-writer clicked merrily. I was in the middle of a fine scene between a
                        baffled company promoter and the simple typist girl who has out witted him
                        on his own ground, when I heard the familiar, long-drawn shriek of the front
                        gate.</p>
                    <p>“The milk,” I thought. And I also thought that perhaps Chloe would not like
                        to face the milkman barefooted, so I went down. I went softly, for I
                        happened to be wearing rubber-soled tennis shoes. In the gallery overlooking
                        the hall I paused, for I heard a voice that was neither Chloe's nor the
                        milkman's—a thin, mean, narrow, doubtfully pitched voice.</p>
                    <p>It came from the front doorstep. In the middle of the hall stood the stack of
                        china shining with soap and water. Half the floor of the hall was cleaned,
                        the other half partially wetted. A pail of brown-colored water stood by the
                            table,<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7142-145"/> and Chloe, her bare feet
                        splashed with that same brown water, and a scrubbing-brush in her hand,
                        advanced towards the voice. The voice said,</p>
                    <p>“Is your mistress at home?”</p>
                    <p>There was an instant of hesitation. Then I saw by the set of my wife's
                        shoulders that she scorned to accept the chance of escape.</p>
                    <p>“Will you come in?” she said, cheerfully. “Mind the pail. I can't shake hands
                        with you, because of the scrubbing-brush.”</p>
                    <p>The woman had not offered to shake hands. She came in—a face and figure that
                        matched the voice—a bonnet and mantle that matched the face and the figure.
                        There were black beads about her.</p>
                    <p>Chloe ostentatiously dusted a chair with a corner of her pinafore, and handed
                        it to her visitor. Then she stood leaning against the table, and looked at
                        the other woman calmly. I ought to have gone down. I ought not to have left
                        Chloe to bear alone this call, the first fruits of our appearance in our
                        parish church the day before. But the picture charmed me. Chloe's grace and
                        ease, the other woman's stiffness and embarrassment, the half-cleaned floor,
                        the scrubbing-brush, the china. I hugged myself on it all.</p>
                    <p>I could see the caller conscientiously trying<pb xml:id="VAB7142-146"/>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7142-147"/> her best to keep her eyes off Chloe's
                        bare feet, and off the scrubbing-brush, and all the rest of it. And I
                        thought Chloe was a little hard upon her. But I was wrong.</p>
                    <p>“Your mistress is out, I suppose,” the woman said. “The vicar told me about
                        the marriage yesterday. I was not at church myself. I hope you will tell
                        your mistress that I called. And don't you think, my good girl, that you
                        could manage to get your dress changed by four in the afternoon? It has a
                        very slatternly appearance. And do you think it conscientious to leave off
                        your cap and apron just because your mistress is not at home? We should try
                        to act the same in people's absence as in their presence. I suppose, now
                        that your fellow-servant has left, you have extra work, but that need not
                        make you careless about personal cleanliness. You must remember that your
                        mistress—”</p>
                    <p>Chloe sat down and crossed her bare feet.</p>
                    <p>“I am my own mistress,” she said, “and the mistress of the Red House. No,
                        don't apologize, unless it is for lecturing another person's servant—of
                        course you couldn't be expected to understand.” Chloe spoke very sweetly,
                        but the woman half rose. “Do sit down. You're the vicar's wife, I suppose,”
                        Chloe went on. “It's<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7142-148"/> very kind of you to
                        call. My husband will be down presently. He shall make the kettle boil and
                        get some tea for you.”</p>
                    <p>The vicar's wife certainly made a brave effort to pull herself together.</p>
                    <p>“I am extremely sorry that the mistake occurred,” she said; “I am rather
                        short-sighted.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, of course you must be, very,” said Chloe, amiably. The vicar's wife
                        looked more and more uncomfortable. Then Chloe took pity on her, and began
                        to laugh.</p>
                    <p>“It was very funny,” she said. “You mustn't mind my laughing a little. Really
                        I ought to be proud to be taken for a servant. But, of course, moving only
                        among the upper classes, you've never met any one who did any house-work
                        except servants. Now, I love house-work. I like it much better than my own
                        proper work.”</p>
                    <p>“What is your own proper work?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, I was taught a trade, and my husband has learned one. We work very
                        hard.”</p>
                    <p>“You must find this house very large, with no servants.” I could not decide
                        whether sympathy or impertinence dictated this speech. Chloe decided.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think so?” she said, politely.</p>
                    <p>The vicar's wife was encouraged to wonder why we had taken the house.</p>

                    <p>“We came to live in it because we wished to,” said my wife.</p>
                    <p>“It's a very heavy rent, I suppose,” the insufferable woman went on.</p>
                    <p>“No,” said my wife. “Thank you so much for asking.”</p>
                    <p>The woman paused ere she offered the return scratch.</p>
                    <p>“You must not expect many callers. I am afraid Elmhurst's very
                        exclusive.”</p>
                    <p>“Indeed! Why, I wonder?”</p>
                    <p>“The leading families are very select. They expect to know all about
                        new-comers, and it is not everybody who can get on the visiting-list of our
                        best set.”</p>
                    <p>“This is very interesting,” said Chloe, calmly. “The habits of the
                        aborigines—”</p>
                    <p>“My dear Mrs.— I fear I do not know your name—I am only warning you for your
                        own good, and to prevent disappointment in the future. <emph>I</emph> shall
                        continue to call on you. A vicar's wife has duties— As the dear Dean of
                        Somerset used to say, ‘Social distinctions do not exist among the wives of
                        the clergy.’”</p>
                    <p>“Did he really? How discerning!”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, he did indeed. But, on the other hand, we learn in our catechism to do
                        our duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call us.<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7142-150"/> And, of course, we all have our appointed
                        stations.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>Shall</emph> please, not has pleased,” corrected Chloe; “we are not
                        forbidden to rise if we can, even from domestic service to the level of the
                        best set in Elmhurst. What <emph>is</emph> the chief qualification? Money, I
                        suppose.”</p>
                    <p>“The best families are very well off,” said the vicaress, innocently. “As the
                        dear Bishop of Selsea used to say, we ought not to associate in intimacy
                        with persons of distinctly different social rank from our own.”</p>
                    <p>“Did he say that? Do you know him, then?”</p>
                    <p>“I have stayed at the palace.”</p>
                    <p>“Are you sure you didn't misunderstand him? I have often heard him say that a
                        man should choose associates of his own <emph>intellectual</emph> rank—”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>You</emph> have often heard him say?” The vicar's wife's voice
                        trembled unaccountably.</p>
                    <p>“Yes—I know him rather well. He is my uncle. I never heard him mention your
                        name. Yet I seem to know your face. Were you not Miss Blake before you
                        married?”</p>
                    <p>The vicar's wife could not deny it.</p>
                    <p>“I remember you when I was a little girl and you were my uncle's housekeeper.
                        Well, I was<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7142-151"/> saying just now, domestic
                        service is a very honorable calling.”</p>
                    <p>There was a desperate pause. The woman was indeed delivered into Chloe's
                        hands by the long arm of coincidence. She rose.</p>
                    <p>“I think I will go now,” she said, in quite a broken voice.</p>
                    <p>Chloe caught her hand impulsively.</p>
                    <p>“I am sorry,” she said. “I wouldn't have said it if I hadn't thought you
                        wanted to be horrid to me. I dare say you didn't, really, but I have a
                        hateful temper. Please forgive me. I won't tell a soul, if you'd rather I
                        didn't. And I like you heaps better since I've remembered that you used to
                        work too. Do forgive me! I won't tell any one, not even my husband,” she
                        went on; and I was shocked to find she could even think of keeping a secret
                        from me. “Say you forgive me, and let me get you some tea.”</p>
                    <p>The vicaress smiled—a smile of sheer embarrassment—yet even that changed her
                        face more pleasantly than I had believed possible.</p>
                    <p>“There's only one thing I wish you would do for me,” Chloe went on. “Don't
                        let the first families of Elmhurst know one of my uncles is a bishop, or
                        they'll call. We want to be quiet. And we live here because the house is our
                        own. The late owner was my husband's uncle.”</p>
                    <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7142-152"/>
                    <p>I came down at this point and was presented to the vicaress. She quite
                        thawed, and we had a pleasant tea. But when we called on her she was as
                        stiff and almost as disagreeable as ever. The habits of a lifetime cannot be
                        uprooted even by such a delightful experience as quarrelling and making it
                        up again with Chloe. When she had gone that day Chloe began to cry. A woman
                        can never get into a royal rage without tears for a sequel.</p>
                    <p>The awful truth about Chloe's uncle must have leaked out somehow, for later
                        on we had streams of callers. Some of them were rather nice. And the vicar's
                        wife was almost the only snob among them. But they were the sort of people
                        who might have called on us anywhere, and they have really no place in the
                        story of the Red House.</p>
                    <p>Yolande wrote to us that she could let one of our cottages to a desirable
                        tenant. We wrote back giving her full powers.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the week Mary and her Jim came back to us and took up their
                        dwelling in the “rooms beyond the kitchen.” Two days later Yolande led me to
                        the cottage desecrated by the presence of Prosser. It was empty. The garden
                        had been cleared of all the unseemly litter that during his occupancy had
                        defiled it. A portion<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7142-153"/> of the cottage
                        garden had even been dug and cleared of weeds. The cottage next door to
                        Prosser's presented a spotless door-step, and its shining windows blinked at
                        us over snowy muslin short blinds.</p>
                    <p>“How did you manage it?” I asked, in rapturous admiration.</p>
                    <p>“How do you get a rat out of its hole?”</p>
                    <p>“Put in a ferret.”</p>
                    <p>“Wise man! And what does the rat do when it sees the ferret?”</p>
                    <p>“Bolts!”</p>
                    <p>“So did Prosser. He knew he was a rat, and fair game for the ferret by virtue
                        of more than one shady act. So when I put in the ferret he bolted.”</p>
                    <p>“But your ferret?”</p>
                    <p>“I let the next—door cottage to the ferret for seven and sixpence a week.
                        Rents are high here. There are very few cottages.”</p>
                    <p>“That's about eighteen pounds a year. Yolande, you're a goddess! And who is
                        your ferret?”</p>
                    <p>“His name is Bates. He is a perfectly respectable ferret. I gave him a hint
                        to give Prosser a hint, and Prosser took it.”</p>
                    <p>“Let's go and tell Chloe.”</p>
                    <p>“I've told her. And she wants to work. Let's<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7142-154"/> go into Prosser's house and look over it. I'm afraid it will want doing
                        up. Mrs. Bates has given it what she calls a rough cleaning down already.
                        Mrs. Bates is a woman after my own heart.”</p>
                    <p>We went over the cottage and decided that it must be repapered
                        throughout.</p>
                    <p>“Mrs. Bates can do that. She's a universal genius.”</p>
                    <p>“Yet you approve—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, in that walk of life.”</p>
                    <p>I was musing. Chloe and I had often thought that we should like to do a
                        little paper-hanging, but I decided not to tell Yolande this.</p>
                    <p>“When it's cleaned and papered,” she said, with kindling enthusiasm, “I'll
                        let that too.”</p>
                    <p>“You shall,” I said, and then hastening away from the subject of
                        paper-hanging, lest she should insist on my giving the order for it to Mrs.
                        Bates that very moment, I said:</p>
                    <p>“By-the-way, you haven't told me yet wherein consists the ferretiness of your
                        ferret, Bates.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, haven't I?” she said, carelessly. “You see, my ferret's a
                        policeman.”</p>
                    <p>This, like Yolande's last-solved problem, was simplicity itself. And yet we
                        had never thought of it!</p>

                    <head>VII</head>
                    <head type="sub">THE HOUSE-WARMING</head>
                    <p><hi>HOW</hi> had Yolande triumphantly justified her boast—her assertion,
                        rather—that she could do for us what we could not do for ourselves. The only
                        thing left us was to try and be grateful. I am almost sure that I succeeded.
                        For the rest, we were extraordinarily comfortable; our domestic service
                        approached perfection, and was, humanly speaking, assured. Bates, that
                        excellent trained ferret, had dislodged the criminal rat which had been our
                        tenant. Peace hovered above us with wide, white wings. But those wings were
                        not permitted to fold themselves about us, because I had a great-aunt, my
                        aunt George. I think I have had occasion to name her before, in connection
                        with a certain patch-work quilt. She gave us the quilt and a pewter teapot
                        on our marriage. She now, quite suddenly, announced that she was coming to
                        see us. My aunt George is fidgety, inquisitive, interfering, unforgiving,<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7142-156"/> and dictatorial. She is also generous,
                        affectionate to such as will sue to her <foreign xml:lang="lat">in forma
                            pauperis</foreign>, and is an excellent sick-nurse. We, being neither
                        sick nor indigent, and finding our home-grown stock of affection sufficient
                        for our humble needs, hastily intrenched ourselves against a long visit by
                        inviting Yolande to occupy our one furnished spare room. Then we invited all
                        the relations who, like the fairies at christenings, would make themselves
                        disagreeable if they were not bidden to a family feast, and plunged headlong
                        into the most exciting preparations for a house-warming. It was to be an
                        evening party with a cold supper, because we could not expect Mary,
                        single-handed, to serve up a hot dinner to a crowd of carping aunts and
                        uncles. The enthusiasm with which we embarked on our labors was tinged, I
                        think, in both of us, by a desire to show Yolande that we could at least
                        deal masterly with a brief crisis, however little we might be able to
                        organize permanent industries.</p>
                    <p>“The materials are unpromising,” said Chloe. “Aunts and uncles aren't the
                        things exactly to make a party ‘<emph>go</emph>’—but Yolande shall see.”</p>
                    <p>“Mayn't we have <emph>any</emph> young couple?” I pleaded, wistfully.</p>
                    <p>“Of course! Not enough to drown the aunts and uncles, but just enough to
                        remind them how<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7142-157"/> superior they are to the
                        follies of youth, and to incite them to show how much more cheerful they can
                        be, in their maturity, than these restless—Oh, Len, I'm talking like a
                        goody-goody book. Come on; let's make a list of who we'll ask, and what we
                        will give them to eat, and who shall sit beside who, and then we'll decide
                        where they're to eat it. We'll save up the peaches for the party. There are
                        three hundred and twenty-six of them.”</p>
                    <p>It is delightful to have three hundred and twenty-six peaches of your very
                        own. It is charming to make lists, especially on rather rough paper, with a
                        B.B. pencil. It is also delightful to roam through a big house, your very,
                        very own, and to decide in which of its many rooms you shall hear the health
                        and happiness of your house toasted.</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>must</emph> be the drawing-room,” said Chloe, at last, “and we must
                        have little tables, with candles and paper shades, like in a hotel, and
                        everything carved on a sideboard.”</p>
                    <p>“We haven't a sideboard,” I said, feebly.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, we can make a sideboard in three minutes—those packing-cases Yolande's
                        china came in. We'll make a big one while we're about it—a really impressive
                        sideboard.”</p>
                    <p>We did make it-in something under three hours. Draped in the red liberty
                        curtains hastily<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7142-158"/> taken down from our
                        bedroom, and covered with a fair white cloth, it was—being ten feet long and
                        four feet high—positively crushing in its impressiveness.</p>
                    <p>We collected all the tables from the other rooms,—even the writing-table from
                        the loafery was brought in—gate tables, Pembroke tables round tables, square
                        tables, long narrow tables, our own tables, Mary's tables, and Mrs. Bates's
                        tables. We selected the least leggy, and arranged our guests' name-cards.
                        The question of wall decorations agitated us a good deal.</p>
                    <p>“If we took every pikky we've got out of all the other rooms,” Chloe said,
                        “they'd hardly show in this great barn. There ought to be some idea—Oh, Len,
                        of course! wreaths of evergreens right up high—oh!—and a frieze of pink
                        muslin, and the evergreens in loops and swags. Delicious!”</p>
                    <p>It takes some time to make properly graduated loops and swags for a room
                        forty feet by twenty-five, and it takes some material. The evergreens in our
                        garden had not had such a pruning this many a year. But we did it; we
                        thought of Yolande, and we did not flinch, though our fingers were blistered
                        and our backs a weariness long before the wreaths were done. The pink muslin
                        proved to be too ruinously expensive, but we bought a pink “lining paper”
                            and<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7142-159"/> pasted it up, and when we had
                        nailed up the evergreens we felt that the result almost paid for our three
                        days' hard labor.</p>
                    <p>Chloe fell into my arms in an ecstasy of mingled pride and exhaustion. “It's
                        a dream,” she said, “an Italian palace! But, oh, I never want to touch box
                        or yew or laurel again as long as I live! And we've only three days now!
                        There'll hardly be time to cook anything.”</p>
                    <p>A fury of egg-beating drove me forth. A man, I was assured, was worse than
                        useless in matters of <foreign xml:lang="fre">cuisine</foreign>. The crisis
                        was urgent; I forebore to complicate it by argument; but Soyer and his noble
                        army of followers seemed to back up my insulted sex, as I walked down the
                        garden-paths, whose breast-high weed growths, mown down by Jim in leisure
                        moments, now permitted glimpses of low-hanging red and golden fruit and
                        russet leaves. The hour was five—nominally tea-time—but what man worthy the
                        name would thrust the need of boiling kettles on two ardent women strenuous
                        in the compounding of sweets?</p>
                    <p>I walked softly in the tennis shoes to which a country life seduces the
                        weaker brethren, and the path was still weed-grown enough to betray nothing
                        of my drawing near to the biggest of the peach-trees on the red south wall.
                            The<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7142-160"/> espaliers connived at my approach
                        by the shelter of their wide-spread arms. Thus it was that I came plump on a
                        man, midway up my wall; his foot rested where a broken brick had been
                        dislodged. He was handing up peaches—my peaches—reserved for the high
                        destiny of auntal and avuncular palates—to a ruffian with a basket, who, in
                        broad day, only one big garden's breadth from a policeman-ferret, sat
                        astride my wall. Some one whistled—it was not I; a spring, a swear, and both
                        villains vanished as if by magic into the paddock. I climbed the wall; they
                        had disappeared in the nettle-coverts of our orchard; nor, when I threaded
                        those coverts, could I run them to earth. It was a poor consolation to
                        return, my feet soaked to the bone through my tennis shoes, to count the
                        peaches and to find that the despicable outcasts had only taken fifteen out
                        of the three hundred and twenty-six.</p>
                    <p>How age mellows one's views! As a boy I never could understand why farmers
                        made such a fuss about a few apples or plums. Now, all the land-owner welled
                        up within me, and I understood it all—with an understanding as full as it
                        was bitter. I thought of netting, of man-traps, of a fierce bull-dog, of men
                        with guns—myself and Jim by turns—incessantly patrolling<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7142-161"/> ling my garden. All other crimes in the decalogue
                        might, I felt, admit of some valid excuse, some reasonable explanation. But
                        breaking the eighth commandment—and with peaches—my peaches—it was
                        intolerable! I felt myself cut off once and forever from the communion of
                        school-boys. Villon was now merely despicable to me.</p>
                    <p>I forebore to fling my heavy news among the eggs, but Yolande came that
                        evening to occupy the spare room, and at dinner I judged the time ripe. My
                        thrilling narrative fell, to my amazement, on inattentive ears. Chloe, whose
                        horror and reprobation I had expected to exceed even my own, merely said,
                        with what I could not persuade myself was a calmness assumed to temper my
                        own agitation: “Oh, did they, dear? How horrid of them!” and absently
                        pressed more fish on me.</p>
                    <p>I withdrew into a proud reserve. When, with a studied air of aloofness, I had
                        carved the mutton, and Mary, having handed the plates and vegetables, left
                        the room, Chloe laid down her fork, and with sparkling eyes turned to
                        Yolande.</p>
                    <p>“Now,” she said, and there was just that suppressed fire about her that I had
                        hoped to waken by my tale of the fruit-stealers—“now,<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7142-162"/> I think we might tell him. You tell him, Yolande,
                        because it's your doing, you clever, intelligent—”</p>
                    <p>“Spare me,” Yolande interrupted; “whatever my faults may be, I'm not
                        intelligent. That's what the police always are when they can't find out the
                        murderer.”</p>
                    <p>“Unintelligent as you are,” said I, “you'll perhaps be able to break the news
                        gently. My nerves are unstrung by to-day's revelation of the cynical
                        immorality of men with baskets.”</p>
                    <p>“Tell him, tell him,” urged Chloe, impatiently. “Len, you're like Nero,
                        talking about unimportant things when— No, nothing's burning. Yolande, if
                        you don't tell him I shall.”</p>
                    <p>“It's nothing,” said Yolande, nonchalantly, crumbling her bread and looking
                        down so as to express indifference with her eyelashes—a very graceful
                        accomplishment. “It's really nothing—only you gave me <foreign xml:lang="fre">carte blanche</foreign> as your land agent, and I've let
                        the big cottage for you—not Prosser's—the one on the other side.”</p>
                    <p>“You have? Chloe, I know it seems the basest ingratitude to Yolande,
                        but—think of Prosser, fairest of land agents, and tell me frankly, has he
                        any references?”</p>
                    <p>“He simply bristles with them. His bank,<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7142-163"/>
                        Coutts's, and his father, a cotton-broker of absolute eminence, were enough
                        for me.”</p>
                    <p>“But where did you catch him? The sons of cotton-brokers with balances at
                        Coutts's are not found in every bush. How did you do it?”</p>
                    <p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">C'est tout simple</foreign>. I advertised. You never
                        thought of that? No. Well, we all have our limitations. Chloe, if you let
                        him throw bread at me I shall tell the tenant the house is unhealthy, and he
                        won't take it. I advertised, he answered. I interviewed the bank and the
                        cottonbroker,—incredibly eminent he really is; I saw it at once. The man
                        himself is a man of action. The agreement, signed, lies warm at this moment
                        against Chloe's heart.”</p>
                    <p>“It's in her Gladstone,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“The man moves his furniture down this week, and there we are!”</p>
                    <p>“He's a journalist, or an author, or something,” said Chloe. “I expect he's
                        awfully nice. Isn't she a genius?”</p>
                    <p>“The rent's a minor point, of course,” I said, humbly, “but if one might
                        ask?”</p>
                    <p>“The rent?” Chloe jumped up from her chair and came round to me. “Oh, Len,
                        what impossibly fortunate people we are! Guess the rent!”</p>
                    <p>“A hundred a year!” I said, promptly.</p>
                    <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7142-164"/>
                    <p>“Don't be horrid.” Chloe's disappointment was very pretty. “I thought you'd
                        say twenty.”</p>
                    <p>“I didn't dare. What is it? Fifteen?”</p>
                    <p>“It's thirty-five!” cried my wife; and at that my generous heart could no
                        longer forbear, and I toasted Yolande in bottled beer.</p>
                    <p>When the enthusiasm of a landlord had sobered in me somewhat, I led the talk
                        back to my fruit-thief—to my secret soul still the most interesting possible
                        topic, because he was my find; the tenant was merely Yolande's. And by
                        skilful tactics I presently roused Yolande's sympathies. The tactics were
                        quite simple. I asked her advice. At once the affair assumed in her eyes new
                        proportions—a new complexion.</p>
                    <p>“I don't know,” she said, knitting her brows; “there must be
                            <corr>some</corr> way.”</p>
                    <p>“You see,” I said, “if one repaired the whole wall, there are ladders, and
                        dark nights to set them up in. You can feel peaches in the dark. And broken
                        bottles can be overcome by sacks of straw—”</p>
                    <p>“And all difficulties by a little thought,” she interrupted, with that superb
                        air of finality which I equally and intensely admire and detest. “Well, I'll
                        think about it.”</p>
                    <p>Yolande was not allowed to help at all in the organizing of the
                        house-warming. An obedient<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7142-165"/> execution of
                        Chloe's orders was all that was permitted her. And when I saw the charming
                        docility with which she carried these out, and her rigorous abstention from
                        even the pointing of an uninvited finger at any pie of Chloe's, I confess
                        that I was humbled and abashed, as in the presence of a soul greater than my
                        own.</p>
                    <p>No one who has not given a party of the dimensions of ours can have the least
                        idea of the Herculean labors involved. We all worked like galley-slaves, and
                        on the morning before the party but little provision had been made save
                        cakes, and the last batch of these were burned because Chloe, who had
                        undertaken to watch their baking, had become all too deeply absorbed in the
                        French cookery-book's recipe for soles à la Normande, a dish which we had
                        neither the means nor the skill to prepare. She came into the hall where
                        Yolande and I were washing the best dessert service,—for so large a party
                        all plates must be requisitioned,—sank on to a chair, stuck out her feet
                        straight before her—an attitude recognized in our code as indicating
                        despair—and said:</p>
                    <p>“It's no use; you'd better send wires to put them all off. The beef is quite
                        the wrong shape; the ham is nearly raw, I'm certain; and none of the things
                        have come from the Stores. And now the cakes are burned!”</p>
                    <pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7142-166"/>
                    <p>“Poor little King Alfred!” I said. “Never mind; we'll worry through
                        somehow.”</p>
                    <p>Do I wrong Yolande, or did a gleam of satisfaction flash through the downcast
                        lashes of eyes ostensibly busy with dish-washing? Did she really say to
                        herself: “I told you so! You can't organize worth a cent, either of
                        you”?</p>
                    <p>I hope not; I almost think not. But, after all, most of us are human, and why
                        not Yolande?</p>
                    <p>Anyhow, if any stirring of the old Adam rose at that moment in Yolande, it
                        was fought down in an instant, and she was imploring Chloe to tell her what
                        to do—to let her run up to town for the Stores-things—anything, everything,
                        rather than that Chloe should be worried and turn her hair gray before its
                        time.</p>
                    <p>At this, the absolutely perfect psychological moment, a shadow fell on the
                        red and white marble from a figure approaching the front door, and a soft
                        voice said, “Mrs. Bates.”</p>
                    <p>“She doesn't live here,” said Yolande, courteously. She took the word, for
                        Chloe, on the verge of tears, sat speechless. “She lives at the first
                        cottage on the way to the station.”</p>
                    <p>“I know,” said the soft voice, betraying in its fourth word the charming
                        accent of the dales. “I <emph>am</emph> Mrs. Bates, and your Mary was
                            telling<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7142-167"/> me you were having a party,
                        and I thought short-handed as likely as not; if there was anything I could
                        do—I lived as cook before I was married—”</p>
                    <p>The situation was saved, and it was Mrs. Bates who saved it—or, to be more
                        accurate, it was Mary, who had drawn Mrs. Bates to our rescue. And—I saw it
                        in Yolande's eyes, though perhaps it was not there—it was really Yolande who
                        had saved the situation, since it was she who had saved to us Mary. Even if
                        I did see it, I dare not grudge Yolande that fleeting triumph. Before the
                        party was over— But let me, above all, tell my tale orderly.</p>
                    <p>For the rest of that day Mrs. Bates and Mary wrought, unaided, in the
                        kitchen, for Chloe, in the abrupt reaction from despair, became suddenly
                        enlightened as to a far more important matter than even food. She had
                        nothing to wear, save yellow, which Aunt George could never abide, and pale
                        blue, in which Uncle Bletherthwaite always remarked how washed-out she
                        looked. So the rest of the day passed in washing, dyeing, and ironing her
                        primrose-colored liberty silk.</p>
                    <p>The dye was pale pink, a brilliant scarlet, or a deep crimson, according to
                        the measure of its dilution. Several minor articles were irrevocably<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7142-168"/> ocably ruined, and gallons of ruddy dye
                        stood about the bath-room in pails, before the right shade of delicate pink
                        was achieved in one of my best white silk ties. Then the primrose gown
                        became rose-colored, and was rinsed and dried and ironed till it looked like
                        a newly blown hollyhock blossom.</p>
                    <p>“I wish there was something more to do,” Chloe said, sighing; “it does seem
                        such a pity to waste all this lovely dye.”</p>
                    <p>My cousin, an experimental chemist, had given me the dye, with the words:
                        “The only thing is, it's such a pure, perfect color, your wife will want to
                        dye everything in the house with it. Don't let her!”</p>
                    <p>Thus forewarned, I was firm, and I carried away the pails. Yolande followed
                        me, begging that the dye might not be thrown away. She would find a use for
                        it. So I put it in the tool-shed among the rakes and forks, the garden
                        syringe, and the grass-cutter—the only place where I could feel sure that no
                        uncle would kick it over inadvertently, no aunt absently sit down on it.</p>
                    <p>And now it was the day of the house-warming. It was a fine day, and, acting
                        on a sudden inspiration, Yolande and I rode over to Blackheath on our
                        bicycles, returning laden with light, enormous<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7142-169"/> mous parcels. They were colored Chinese lanterns.
                        We hung them from the trees near the house. And then, further inspired, I
                        tore off for more, and we strung them on wires and made the house beautiful
                        with them. The big drawing-room, with its evergreen garlands, its little
                        white-draped tables, sparkling with borrowed glass and silver, its bowls of
                        radiant dahlias, its tall green glasses of Japanese anemones, its pinkshaded
                        candles, and over all the mellow glow of the many-colored lanterns, was a
                        picture at which our hearts beat high with pride. The sideboard groaned (it
                        really did groan, and that in no mere commonplace metaphorical way, but
                        honestly, because it was, in its inmost heart, only packing-cases) beneath
                        the weight of as fine a cold supper as any aunt could wish to see, any uncle
                        wish to eat. Chloe's pink hollyhock gown was an exquisite success. Yolande's
                        was like a white hollyhock bloom. All was ready. The first wheels crushed
                        the gravel of our drive. The first uncle was relieved of his great-coat by
                        my hands, the first aunt escorted by Chloe to “take off her things.” Aunts
                        will not dispense with personal attendance in this ceremony. Gradually the
                        hall filled. Ponderous uncles and portly aunts occupied the heavier chairs.
                        Lean aunts and uncles stood<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7142-170"/> conversing
                        with frosty geniality. A great-uncle and a second-cousin who had not spoken
                        for years—a family affair about a trust and an Australian gold-mine, nothing
                        personally discreditable to either—sank their old feud and found out how
                        much they still had in common, as they discussed in a wheezy undertone the
                        extraordinary extravagance of their host and hostess—agreeing almost
                        cordially in the opinion that we were living in a style far, far beyond our
                        means. Cousins of every degree enthusiastically compared notes as to the
                        difficulty of getting to our house. Three nice nieces and a manly nephew or
                        two offered conventional amiabilities to their elders. We had furnished and
                        adorned the hall, and no one, we felt, could look on its marble floor and
                        wainscoted walls without feeling himself privileged in being allowed to take
                        part in such a pageant, so admirably staged. My aunt George objected to the
                        wainscot as dark and out of date, and said the marble floor was cold to the
                        feet. My uncle Reginald agreed with her, but added handsomely that beggars
                        mustn't be choosers, and no doubt we were wise not to waste our money on
                        carpets. Altogether, everything was going splendidly.</p>
                    <p>When the gong sounded I think it was felt<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7142-171"/>
                        to be an extravagance. I remedied this as far as I could by telling Aunt
                        George, as I gave her my arm, that the gong was a wedding-present to Chloe.
                        And so it was, but I bought it.</p>
                    <p>We crowded into the big drawing-room. Even Aunt George admitted that it
                        looked very nice—but not until I had asked her if it didn't. And then she
                        said it would have looked better without those Christmas decorations! These
                        were our loops and swags. I saw more than one uncle cast a glance at the
                        foot of the sideboard as he passed, and I wondered in anguish whether the
                        drapery had displaced itself and the naked packing-cases were disclosed to
                        the shocked eyes of aunts. But I could not see. Yet the suspense was
                        unbearable. Under pretext of turning down a lamp, I went to see. I must know
                        the worst. The worst was a row—a long row—of gold-topped bottles.</p>
                    <p>I flashed reproachful glances at Chloe, and as I passed behind her chair, she
                        murmured: “It's all right. Asti. The new tenant.”</p>
                    <p>It seemed to me, in my agitation, to be like the new tenant's cheek, and not
                        at all like Chloe, but this was no time for anything but the duties of a
                        host. I returned to Aunt George, who said, “I wish to goodness you wouldn't
                        run about so!”</p>
                    <p>Mary and Mrs. Bates waited, and the waiting<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7142-172"/>
                        ing was excellent. So was the Chianti, which was all I had intended our
                        wine-bill to run to. But the uncles looked at the gold-topped bottles, so
                        did some of the cousins. The aunts looked away from them. So I said: “Aunt
                        George, we've some very fine Italian sparkling wine here—a present. I should
                        like you to try it.”</p>
                    <p>As soon as I had said “a present,” I caught my wife's shocked glance, and
                        knew the truth; she had bought the Asti on the strength of our new tenant.
                        But the words were out; so, in a few moments, were the corks. The avuncular
                        condemnation of Italian vintages was almost unanimous—but avuncular eyes
                        sparkled, and a sort of soft current of cheerfulness passed round the room.
                        At the round table at the other end where sat the nephews and nieces and the
                        few young people whom we had asked to meet them, there was a low buzz of
                        chattering and laughter. Yolande was at that table. She had insisted on
                        it.</p>
                    <p>“Your uncle George always said,” my aunt George was saying, as she held out
                        her glass to be refilled, “that no sparkling wine was worth the drinking
                        except—” when a sudden rapping on the table left her with only time for a,
                        “Well, I'm sure,” before a general silence abashed her into quiet.</p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7142-173"/>
                    <p>Uncle Bletherthwaite rose heavily in his place. He made a speech. The Fates
                        forbid that I should render it to you. It was of a studied temperateness; it
                        dwelt on our blessings; expressed, tepidly, the pleasure he felt in seeing
                        us at last (he repeated “at last,” and I knew he was thinking that it was
                        eight months since he had dined with us) in our home and with our family (he
                        looked at Yolande) gathered about us. It dwelt, and I thought at somewhat
                        too great a length, on the good dinners he had eaten in this house in my
                        uncle Thomas's days, and the good wine he had drunk (he looked disparagingly
                        at the Asti); it ended by a formal hope that we and those now assembled
                        round our board might long be spared (which I could see he didn't think
                        likely), and with a wish that our new home might be a blessing to us. (Of
                        course it was perfectly plain that, however much he might wish it, it
                        appeared to him but too improbable.) He said, finally, and with a sigh, “I
                        and your aunts and cousins and other relations, including, I am sure, those
                        present who are not members of the family, drink to the prosperity of the
                        Red House.”</p>
                    <p>The toast was drunk in the gloomiest silence—as to the memory of those who
                        had fallen.</p>
                    <p>All the lights seemed to burn lower; there<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7142-174"/>
                        was an awkward pause. Chloe bit her lip and would not look at me.</p>
                    <p>Then suddenly there was another buzz from the youthful table, and our eldest
                        nephew rose in his place.</p>
                    <p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began (adding by what was scarcely a happy
                        after-thought, “and aunts and uncles”), “we have drunk to the old house, and
                        now I want to call another toast—with your kind permission,” he said,
                        catching the eye of an elderly cousin. “So fill your glasses, please—no
                        heel-taps—bumpers, please! Here's to the jolliest aunt and uncle that ever
                        were. The dearest and kindest and jolliest and best—Aunt Chloe and Uncle
                        Len. Long life and happiness to them! God bless them! There!”</p>
                    <p>It was his first speech, dear boy, and I think he hoped then that it might be
                        his last. I saw his hand trembling as he lifted his glass. Then suddenly all
                        the young people stood up; a momentary hesitation ended in the rustling
                        rising of elder relatives, and through the rustle came the first words of
                        the refrain, from the young table: <quote>
                            <l>“For they are jolly good fellows,</l>
                            <l>For they are jolly good fellows,</l>
                            <l>Oh, they are jolly good fellows,</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">And so say all of us.”</l>
                        </quote></p>
                    <pb xml:id="VAB7142-175"/>
                    <p> </p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7142-176"/>
                    <p>Before the singing was over Aunt George was leading it in her high sweet old
                        voice, and Uncle Bletherthwaite was thundering an irresponsible bass. I did
                        not know where to look, and I believe Chloe nearly wept. I made some sort of
                        speech—I don't know how. Having one's health drunk like that is a thing that
                        doesn't happen often—thank goodness. So one feels it oddly.</p>
                    <p>The party “went” like wildfire after that. It was almost as delightful as if
                        none of us had been related to each other at all. The tables were cleared,
                        then with the help of nephews and the less frail among the cousins, cleared
                        away bodily. Yolande sang to the guitar, and aunts nodded approval. A niece
                        and a nephew danced a minuet, and cousins were mildly pleased. Then Yvonne
                        and the prettiest niece danced a cachucha, and uncles were enchanted. Some
                        one sang—an uncle, I think; some one sniffed—no doubt an aunt; and coffee
                        was served at the absolutely right moment. Then shawls and hats were handed
                        like refreshments, and we all trooped out into the garden by the moat to
                        look at the moonlight and the Chinese lanterns, craftily lighted by Mrs.
                        Bates while the cachucha was enchanting us. The night was warm as June.
                        Groups of persons—all related,<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7142-177"/> yet for the
                        moment all at peace with each other—stood “beneath the dreaming garden
                        trees.” Chloe and I glowed with a flush of successful hospitality.</p>
                    <p>Then suddenly, sharply, the silence of the night, with its soft embroidery of
                        talking and laughter, was shattered—torn roughly asunder by a scream, and
                        another scream, from the walled garden beyond the moat. Feminine cousins
                        paled; male cousins spoke ejaculatorily of pistols; stout uncles breathed
                        heavily of police. A few of us hastened towards the walled garden. At the
                        door that leads to it from the moat garden we came face to face with two
                        figures, a man and a woman, who staggered as they walked; both were in
                        white, and both were stained on face and hands and garments with dark,
                        ominous stains.</p>
                    <p>“Just our luck!” I murmured. “What an end to a family party!” For the light
                        of a saffron-colored lantern showed us unmistakably that the stains were
                        blood-red.</p>
                    <p>I flung an arm round the blood-stained woman to sustain her. And the woman
                        was Yolande. And I heard my uncle Bletherthwaite murmur, “Well, I never!” as
                        though he had foreseen the whole thing.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE TENANT</head>
                    <p><hi>A GARDEN</hi> hung with soft-tinted Chinese lanterns glowing amid gleams
                        of green leaf-lights and deeps of black leaf-shadow; a company of aunts and
                        uncles placated by food, drink, and the servile attentions of nephews and
                        nieces; a silvery atmosphere of peace, shot with faint streaks of something
                        almost approaching a modified approval; a host and hostess weary, though not
                        wholly exhausted—yet counting the moments till the last uncle, having
                        consumed the ultimate whiskey, should depart in the last of the cabs—and the
                        rest of us—Chloe, Yolande, and I—should be left to look back on the party
                        and “talk it over.”</p>
                    <p>And now, on this almost pastoral stage, where uncles were all but in tune to
                        pipe, and aunts not far from the mood when one wreathes one's crook with
                        flowers, intrudes a harsh shriek from the darkness of the farther garden, to
                        be followed<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7142-179"/> lowed by the unspeakably
                        dramatic entrance of a man and a woman stained with—well, it looked like
                        blood, exactly.</p>
                    <p>The woman, as I have said, was Yolande; the man, whom she led familiarly, yet
                        with a certain ferocity, by the hand, was a perfect stranger. His eyes were
                        closed and his face was stained with crimson. It dripped still from his head
                        and ears on to the flannels which earlier in the evening must have been
                        pearly white.</p>
                    <p>Every aunt shuddered, every uncle winced. Uncle Bletherthwaite so far forgot
                        himself as to mutter, “Good God!” which, in the “presence of ladies,” was
                        more from him than a good round damn might be from the lighter brethren.</p>
                    <p>The nephews and nieces crowded round, cousins drew cautiously near, and as
                        soon as it had been inferred from my attitude in respect to Yolande that she
                        at least was no stranger to me, the semicircle of aunts and uncles closed up
                        about us. Uncle Reginald told me afterwards that he feared the worst just
                        then, for none of them recognized Yolande under her new crimson disguise. As
                        Uncle Reginald said, “They none of them knew her from Adam.” He added, “By
                        Jove! just for the moment I forgot my morals, and I was sorry for you, my
                        boy—I was indeed.”</p>
                    <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7142-180"/>
                    <p>I do not seek to know what he meant. Chloe was very angry when I told
                        her.</p>
                    <p>And now there was a breathless silence. It was like the scene in Kipling's
                            <title>His Wedded Wife</title>.</p>
                    <p>I broke the silence. I shook Yolande, and said, I fear not too amiably, “My
                        dear girl, what on earth is it?”</p>
                    <p>“Lend me your handkerchief,” she said, irrelevantly; and, taking it, wiped
                        scarlet dews from her brow and hands. “Oh, let me get away. And take him
                        away and clean him, won't you? It's all got into his eyes.”</p>
                    <p>She dropped the hand of the stranger, and would have fled, but Aunt George
                        barred the way.</p>
                    <p>“After this scene we've just seen,” she said, “I think it's due to your
                        company to explain.”</p>
                    <p>The flannelled man got at his handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>“Jove! it does sting,” he said, rubbing at his eyes. “I can't get my eyes
                        open. Won't somebody take me where there's a tap and put me under it?”</p>
                    <p>He had a pleasant voice, but it did not soften the aunts and uncles.
                        Curiosity had taken the place of terror.</p>
                    <p>“Asking for taps like this,” said Uncle Bletherthwaite, “is no excuse for
                        this unwarrantable<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7142-181"/> intrusion into the
                        midst of a family gathering. This young person—”</p>
                    <p>“A member of the family gathering,” I urged.</p>
                    <p>Then Yolande detached herself from me, gave her face a final scrub, and spoke
                        sweetly: “Oh, please don't be alarmed. There were some pails of red stuff
                        put aside for the fruit trees, and this gentleman, who lives next door,
                        unfortunately came in contact with them; and I had remembered the pails were
                        there, and was just going to attend to them” (“In that dress!” said Aunt
                        George, with a sniff), “and I brought him in to be washed. I think I myself
                        will also wash. Good-night. I am so sorry to have alarmed you.”</p>
                    <p>She passed the cordon of relations and fled, her last words a whisper to
                        me:</p>
                    <p>“Their carriages are beginning to come. Leave Chloe to get rid of them. That
                        man <emph>must</emph> be washed, or he'll die or be blind, or
                        something.”</p>
                    <p>So I took him to the bath-room and left him with the hot tap and the cold
                        tap, and the hip-bath and the foot-bath and the long bath, and the
                        hand-basin and the soap and a pile of towels, and some clothes of mine. And
                        all seemed inadequate. I did not believe he would ever be his right color
                        again.</p>
                    <pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7142-182"/>
                    <p>Then, Heaven be praised! there were cabs and trains, and the house-warming
                        party melted away, Aunt George protesting to the last against Yolande's
                        explanation as a mere excuse for “goings-on,” and Uncle Bletherthwaite
                        feverishly anxious, even through the cab window, as to the nature of the
                        crimson dressing designed for our fruit trees. At long last the last
                        lingering cab-borne cousin left our gates, and Chloe and I turned to each
                        other in the empty hall. A pale and cautious Yolande in a white wrapper
                        peered down the stairs.</p>
                    <p>“Are they gone? Oh, give him lemons—many lemons; I've got it all off my face
                        with that. My hands are past praying for.”</p>
                    <p>Our strangely introduced guest was still splashing and laughing and—well,
                        grumbling—to himself over the lemons when Yolande rejoined us in the
                        drawing-room.</p>
                    <p>“He'll be ages yet,” she said. “You don't know what it is to get off. And
                        he's simply soaked through and through.”</p>
                    <p>“Yolande,” I said, sternly, “I have borne enough; this ensanguined masquerade
                        requires, as Uncle Bletherthwaite says, some explanation more
                        convincing—”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, bother!” she cried. “I am a dog, and an outcast, and an abject idiot—and
                        I'll tell<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7142-183"/> you everything.” She fell a
                        dejected heap into the easy-chair where Aunt George had sat so upright
                        during the minuet and the cachucha. “I know you'll scorn me forever. But ‘a
                        fault that's owned is half atoned,’ and I'll own my fault. It was only my
                        only and always fault—I have but the one, you know—being too jolly clever by
                        half. I'll never try to do anything again.”</p>
                    <p>“Tell us quickly, before he gets clean,” Chloe pleaded. “Who is he? What was
                        it? How did it happen? Quick—before he bursts upon us with his clean
                        face.”</p>
                    <p>“There's no hurry,” said Yolande, gloomily, twisting her reddened fingers
                        tightly together. “You needn't be afraid of seeing his face clean yet
                        awhile. Well, when you talked about the fruit-thief, I thought to myself, if
                        one could only mark the thief thoroughly, it would be as good as catching
                        him, because you could wire to all the police stations, ‘Lost, Stolen, or
                        Strayed, a Pink-spotted Fruit-stealer!’ I thought I was quite clever, and
                        really I was a mere lunatic.”</p>
                    <p>I had never seen Yolande so near tears.</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>was</emph> a good idea,” said Chloe, perfunctorily sympathetic;
                        “and so you took that pink dye—”</p>
                    <pb xml:id="VAB7142-184"/>
                    <p> </p>
                    <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7142-185"/>
                    <p>“Yes. I hid two pails of it, one among the currant-bushes and one under the
                        quince-tree. And then when we were in the garden I saw a flash, and I knew
                        some one had struck a match—to see where the peaches were, I thought.
                        Really, of course, it must have been this wretched man lighting his hateful
                        pipe. So I stole away, and I got the big brass garden syringe.”</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>was</emph> a good idea,” said Chloe, with more conviction.
                        “Well?”</p>
                    <p>“Well—oh, then I stalked him; and even when I was close to him I never knew
                        he was just a human being in flannels. I thought he was playing ghost, and I
                        said to myself, ‘All the better to mark you on, my friend!’ Oh, it
                            <emph>was</emph> funny.” She began to laugh shakily. “There was I
                        creeping along with my syringe full charged, and the pail in my other
                        hand—held well out, because of my gown—and he, poor soul, sauntering along
                        in the shadows of the nut-walk, thinking nothing less than that some one was
                        advancing with his pink doom. When he was a couple of yards off I fired a
                        volley—slap in his face—and turned to run. He swore—but I forgive him that.
                        My pail caught in a bough, and went over his feet, for he jumped towards the
                        noise; he is not a coward. He caught hold of my dress, in the dark (he's
                        torn a yard<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7142-186"/> out at the gathers, but it
                        doesn't matter; the dress was ruined anyway), and as soon as I had heard his
                        voice, even though it was swearing—I <emph>knew</emph> what I'd done, and I
                        said: ‘It's all a mistake. I'm Yolande Riseborough. Can't you see?’ for he
                        was staggering about. And then I saw he couldn't, and I said: ‘Come and be
                        cleaned. Give me your hand.’ And so I brought him in, and on the way we
                        tumbled over the other pail. And <foreign xml:lang="fre">nous
                            voici</foreign>—”</p>
                    <p>“You know him, then?”</p>
                    <p>“Know him? Any one would have known him, when it was too late. Oh, my broken
                        heart! What will you do to me when <emph>you</emph> know? He'll never
                        stay—”</p>
                    <p>“If you play at sphinxes another moment I shall slap you. Who is it?”</p>
                    <p>“It's your new tenant. That's all,” said Yolande, with what is termed the
                        calmness of despair. “You know, permission to walk in the garden was given
                        as one of the extra attractions of the cottage. I'll never try to be clever
                        again. I got you the tenant—cotton-broking lineage, and Coutts's bank, and
                        all—and now I've squirted him with red dye out of a brass garden syringe,
                        and he will never forgive it; and I wish I was dead.”</p>
                    <p>One on each side of her, we were doing our<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7142-187"/>
                        best to console, when the bath-room door opened. We heard it. I flew into
                        the corridor, pushed by four fair hands. I intercepted my partially washed
                        tenant. I made him a speech of manly apology. Important as his tenancy was
                        to me, I did not, even then, grovel before him. I was getting on fairly well
                        with the speech when my tenant began to laugh—one of the jolliest laughs I
                        ever heard. And from the drawing-room Chloe's laugh and Yolande's joined in
                        it. So that in a few moments I had presented my tenant to my wife, and we
                        were all talking at once, explaining and expounding, while I struggled with
                        the wire of the last but two of the bottles of Asti.</p>
                    <p>My tenant was young; Chloe considered him handsome. He certainly had a
                        well-shaped head and extremely merry blue eyes. He was at home with us at
                        once. Stiffness of demeanor is difficult to maintain in the immediate
                        sequence of events such as had introduced us.</p>
                    <p>Three courses were open to him, as Mr. Gladstone used to say. He might have
                        stormed, raged, threatened, and retired; he might have retired, frigidly
                        polite; in either case following up the retirement by a notice of the
                        termination of the tenancy. Or he might have laughed and made the best of
                        it, and of us. This he had done. I liked the man, and I almost forgave him
                            for<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7142-188"/> being able to play the guitar—a
                        most effeminate accomplishment, and one I never could acquire, for all
                        Chloe's teaching—when I heard that he had learned it in the Philippines
                        during the war. I detest and distrust sudden intimacies, but it was
                        impossible to treat this man as a stranger. By dyeing—or being accessory to
                        the dyeing of—a new acquaintance crimson, you skip a hundred mile-stones on
                        the road to friendship. But it might be a hazardous experiment. Anyway, it
                        was not till the small hours were growing out of all knowledge, and
                        beginning to take notice, that we parted from our tenant. A second, and much
                        better, supper had risen for us, phœnix-like, from the ashes of the first;
                        we had sung songs, told travellers' tales, made jokes, and when at last I
                        saw the injured tenant to his door there were hints of gray in the east.</p>
                    <p>When I came back, Chloe and Yolande, candle-bearing, had paused on the stairs
                        for a last word.</p>
                    <p>“He's wonderful,” I said. “The right sort.”</p>
                    <p>“One of our kind—yes,” said Chloe; “some people are, don't you know, and some
                        aren't; quite nice people, too, sometimes, curiously enough. And people who
                        aren't very clever are, now and then. Besides that, he's charming—isn't he,
                        Yolande?”</p>
                    <pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7142-189"/>
                    <p>Yolande stifled a yawn, and said she supposed he was all right.</p>
                    <p>“What a night of adventures for us!” I said, “and, oh, my only hat! what a
                        night for him!”</p>
                    <p>“He may think himself lucky,” said Yolande. “How angel-good you were to him,
                        Chloe! Goodnight.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you think it was a success—the real party?” asked Chloe, anxiously. “They
                            <emph>couldn't</emph> believe that about the fruit and the dye.”</p>
                    <p>“It was true,” said Yolande, “so I suppose they couldn't. Oh yes, it's all
                        right; give them something to talk about for months. It was a splendid
                        party, Chloe, though I didn't have anything to do with it. I'll never put my
                        finger into any one else's pie again!”</p>
                    <p>She held up her pink-dyed fingers with a rather rueful laugh.</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes, you will,” I said, “for the pie's our good! You see, this was such a
                        very pink pie—and, besides, it was just that sort of an unimportant detail
                        that doesn't suit your genius. But it's taught—”</p>
                    <p>“Taught me a lesson? Yes, rub it in!”</p>
                    <p>“No; it's taught us our tenant. I think he's worth learning. I'm glad we know
                        him. Goodnight.”</p>
                    <p>So ended our house-warming.</p>
                    <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7142-190"/>
                    <p>It was an extravagant entertainment, but the thought of the new tenant's rent
                        upheld us through the gloomy work of paying the bills; and the price for my
                        stories, as for Chloe's pictures, was rising steadily. I now had only to
                        begin a story, and, if Yolande were staying with us, it found itself
                        finished, and finished well, without my help. And I could not disguise from
                        myself that my stories met now with a reception far more flattering than
                        ever awaited them in the old days. My articles I was still allowed to write
                        on “my own unaided hook,” and I rejoiced in this till the editor of the
                            <title>Weekly Wilderness</title> sent me an amiable letter
                        congratulating me on the style of certain tales which he had had the
                        pleasure of reading in the magazines and weeklies, over my signature, and
                        suggesting that my articles would be none the worse for a little of the
                        “pathetic sort of thing” as well as the “light ironic touch” which he had
                        noticed in the stories. Then I showed Chloe the letter, and said several
                        things. Among others I swore that I would not be interfered with any more in
                        my work.</p>
                    <p>“I know she means it kindly,” I said. “I know it's done entirely to serve us
                        and help us, and it's most kind and charitable, and I simply won't stand it.
                        I'm not going to go on being complimented on other people's work.”</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7142-191"/>
                    <p>Chloe was turning over the pages of the paper in which the last but three of
                        these stories had appeared. “But they're good, aren't they—rather good, I
                        mean?” said she.</p>
                    <p>“They're so beastly good,” said I, “that I won't put my name to another of
                        them. If it weren't that the whole business sounds so silly, I'd tell every
                        single editor to-morrow, and advertise the facts in the <title>Times</title>
                        as well.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe had grown quite pale.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len, <title>don't</title>!” she said; “the ghost only wants to
                        help.”</p>
                    <p>“Yolande—”</p>
                    <p>“Yolande will be off to Italy quite soon now, with her horrid pupils. Len,
                        dear, to please me, don't make any more fuss. You don't know how unhappy it
                        makes me. Wait till she's gone. Perhaps the ghost won't write any more, now
                        it knows you don't like it.”</p>
                    <p>“You mean you'll tell her to drop it?” said I. “What must she think of me for
                        letting it go on so long? Well, my mind's made up now; I'll speak to Yolande
                        myself—”</p>
                    <p>“No, no, no! Dear Len, don't. I'm sure the ghost won't write any more. And I
                        can't think why you mind. Yes—I see you do—and—But <emph>I'm</emph> quite
                        pleased when the ghost touches up my drawings, or even when it does them
                            for<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7142-192"/> me altogether. Dear ghost! Len, it
                        doesn't matter which of us does the work.” Her voice was very small, and
                        broken, and I felt a brute.</p>
                    <p>“It wouldn't matter which of <emph>us</emph> did the work, my pussy-kitten,”
                        I said, “but Yolande's not one of us. She's our land-agent and our
                        registry-office, as it is, and that ought to be enough even for her. If you
                        don't speak to her, I shall.”</p>
                    <p>“Then I will,” said she, turning away. “Go on with your work. I'm certain no
                        nasty ghost will come and interfere any more.”</p>
                    <p>Still raging, I sat down to the type-writer and snapped off a letter to my
                            <title>Weekly Wilderness</title> editor. Then of course I went to look
                        for Chloe. I found her crouched among the blue and green cushions on the
                        faded green divan in the loafery, and I stayed there with her head on my
                        shoulder till she had consented to be completely comforted. I told her that
                        I “did not mean to be cross,” and when I had said it many times she believed
                        it, and so did I, though it was not at all true.</p>
                    <p>After that no ghost ever laid finger on my type-writer, and I worked at it
                        harder than ever. And my stories were not nearly so good as the ghost-ridden
                        ones. But my drawings grew better and better, as I did more and more of
                        them—all of which Chloe signed and sent off with a cheerful gratitude,
                        perhaps a little too pronounced, and<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7142-193"/>
                        designed, I knew, to show me that <emph>she</emph> wasn't too proud to
                        accept help from a ghost—or a friend.</p>
                    <p>The humiliation which stung me every time I thought of my indebtedness to a
                        writer more expert than I drove me to this curious retaliation in Fate—or
                        Chloe—or Yolande—or the ghost. Since Chloe could bear that my work should be
                        supplemented and improved by another hand—a hand neither hers nor mine—it
                        pleased me mightily to reflect that no hand but mine had ever tampered with
                        her work, and that she did not know to whom belonged the hand whose help she
                        accepted so lightly. I hugged myself in the knowledge that it was mine,
                        mine, mine. An order to illustrate a child's book had thrilled her with
                        delight. She has a pretty fancy. She can <emph>see</emph> pictures—but she
                        cannot draw them. It was on her sketches that I always worked; and I worked
                        hard to finish that child's book before Yolande should take flight for
                        Italy. I found it hard to conceal from Yolande my growing irritation at the
                        ghost's part in my stories—an irritation doubled, of course, by vexation at
                        the weakness of my former acquiescence. It was hard to keep the word I had
                        pledged to Chloe, hard not to have it out with Yolande. There would, I
                        think, have been a constraint strong<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7142-194"/>
                        enough to force on a crisis of explanations but for our new tenant. He
                        distracted us.</p>
                    <p>He called on us; he invited us to tea; he sent us tickets for the theatres.
                        When I saw him strolling among the green of our garden—for he spent most of
                        the time there that he could snatch from his newspaper-office—I sometimes
                        hated to think that our garden was no longer only our own; but he was
                        discreet. If Chloe and I set foot in the garden, he disappeared, as swiftly
                        as though our weed-grown walks had been a wishing-carpet. But when Yolande
                        walked alone in the garden he sometimes joined her. Of course to her the
                        garden was merely a green space to walk in. To us—and I liked our tenant for
                        perceiving this—the garden was something far other and far more. He dined
                        with us—on a bottled-beer footing—more than once, and more than once we and
                        Yolande dined with him at his cottage. On the first of these times Chloe and
                        I could not help exchanging glances when we saw how the soft yellow of our
                        tenant's sitting-room wall-paper suited his black-framed etchings and
                        mezzotints. Yolande surprised the glance, and it betrayed us to her. She
                        taxed us roundly with the crime, later on, as we sat sipping cocoa round the
                        kitchen fire at home.</p>
                    <p>“When will you learn wisdom?” she sighed.<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7142-195"/>
                        “You know you papered that cottage yourselves.”</p>
                    <p>We owned it shamefacedly.</p>
                    <p>“Are there no poor paper-hangers out of work? I ask more in sorrow than in
                        anger. Are there no painters in Elmhurst?”</p>
                    <p>Here Chloe plucked up a spirit and said we enjoyed doing it.</p>
                    <p>“The old defence—which is none,” said Yolande, setting down her cup on the
                        broad fender. “How many glorious golden guineas could you two have turned at
                        your own trades in the time it took you to do that house? Oh yes, I saw the
                        exquisite way you'd made the patterns match, and how delicately you'd
                        negotiated all those difficult odd corners. You are incorrigible!”</p>
                    <p>“It comes of property,” I said. “Our property is exigent. We love it, and it
                        presumes on our affection and makes us do things for it. It's like doing
                        things for one's own child. Mothers like to wash and dress their own babies,
                        and they don't think it waste of time to spend hours over it—even if they
                            <emph>might</emph> be earning money instead and keeping whole armies of
                        competent professional nurses. Now your property—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I know,” Yolande interrupted; “my property's in consols—what there is
                        of it—and I love it for itself alone. It has no sentimental<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7142-196"/> claims. Don't throw it up at me. But even if I
                        had a house and a garden and cottages and all the rest of it—”</p>
                    <p>“If you had a husband,” said Chloe, looking up suddenly from the red heart of
                        the fire at which she had been blinking, “wouldn't you like to sew on his
                        buttons and mend his socks?”</p>
                    <p>“Never,” cried Yolande, with energy. “You can get them done for a penny a
                        pair, and men ought to sew on their own buttons—”</p>
                    <p>We laughed.</p>
                    <p>“He may divert his energies so far?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes; it's good for a man, because he never does it—or he never does it
                        because it's good for him.”</p>
                    <p>“Pardon me,” I said, firmly. “I myself—”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, <emph>you</emph>!” she said; “but I am sleepy and stupid, and I shall
                        never be married and sit over my own kitchen fire. Good-night,
                        Cinderella.”</p>
                    <p>“Good-night, Fairy Godmother,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>I handed Yolande her brass candlestick and went back to my wife and my own
                        fireside. When we had sat silent for a little, listening to the slow ticking
                        of the tall clock, Chloe said, still blinking at the fire:</p>
                    <p>“That was quite true—what you said about doing things for your own—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” I said, “I know it was.”</p>
                    <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7142-197"/>
                    <p>“How can people let nurses do everything for their babies?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” I said again, “how can they?”</p>
                    <p>Her cheek was against my shoulder by this time and my face against her hair.
                        So we sat silent another space. Then suddenly she lifted her head and said,
                        “Len, if she ever is married, she'll be just as silly as other people.”</p>
                    <p>“Probably,” said I.</p>
                    <p>“I wonder if our tenant—”</p>
                    <p>“Of course he admires her. We all do—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, but—”</p>
                    <p>“It's absurd,” I said, with some heat, for which I can give no reason; “she
                        hardly knows him at all.”</p>
                    <p>“That doesn't matter,” said my wife. “Have you forgotten—”</p>
                    <p>I had not forgotten. It is a joy to both of us still to remember how few
                        times we had met before we <emph>knew</emph>, quite surely and without
                        mistake, and so ran into each other's arms in the safe confidence and
                        knowledge that there, for each, was the only possible home.</p>
                    <p>“But other people are different,” I said, after a while.</p>
                    <p>“Not all of them—and not so very,” said Chloe. “And I think he likes
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense!” I said; “and, besides, he's not half good enough for her.”</p>
                    <pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7142-198"/>
                    <p>“I knew you'd say that,” she cried, jumping up. “No, I'm not going to sit on
                        your knee another moment.” She busied herself in lighting our candle. “I
                        knew you'd say that. Isn't it odd? Women are so glad to think of their
                        friends being perhaps going to be happy. But men always feel injured at the
                        mere idea that a girl they like might marry some one else. Dogs in the
                        manger!”</p>
                    <p>“It's not the polygamous instinct at all, my pussy-kitten,” I said. “It's
                        only that women believe in marriage, and men don't.”</p>
                    <p>“Don't they?” said she. “Don't you?”</p>
                    <p>“But our marriage isn't at all like other marriages. Now, is it?”</p>
                    <p>“Isn't it? Oh, I hope it is! I shouldn't like to think ours was the only
                        proper marriage. It can't be, of course. There must be heaps of people as
                        fond of each other as we are. Don't you think so? And quite as happy.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you think so?” She had lighted the candle and was standing looking at me
                        as I took off my boots. I stood up in my stockinged feet and put my arm
                        round her. “Do you?” I asked again.</p>
                    <p>“No,” she said, beginning to smile and blinking softly at me, “honestly, I'm
                        afraid I don't.”</p>
                    <p>“And I don't, either,” said I.</p>

                    <head type="sub">MANLY SPORTS</head>
                    <p><hi>I HAVE</hi> been writing like a man milliner. I have found no manly tale
                        to set forth—only a record of domesticity almost florid in its decorative
                        detail. Let the accomplished specialist in obscure psychology seek, and find
                        if he can, the reason. For me, let me only say that had Chloe written it the
                        tale had been far otherwise. Chloe would have dwelt, at strenuous length, on
                        my encounter with the coal-man who refused to carry sacks down our cellar
                        stairs. Had he contented himself with a courteous refusal, my sympathies, I
                        own, would have been with him, for the stairs are mediæval in their
                        uncompromising inconvenience, their gratuitous dangerousness.</p>
                    <p>But the coal-man did not stop at that, and when I came on the scene Chloe,
                        with tears of pure rage in her eyes, and in the low, sweet voice that is
                        always lowest and sweetest when she is<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7142-200"/>
                        most furious, was ordering him out. And he was explaining, in detail, what
                        he would be if he would go before he was ready. So I turned him out. Chloe
                        would have made an epic of this.</p>
                    <p>I suppose cutting down dead trees is manly work, and I certainly did that.
                        Also I sawed them into lengths proportioned to the wood-basket. But Chloe
                        always sat on the bough to keep it steady, so sawing cannot count as mere
                        man's work. Rabbit-catching sounds manly enough, but Chloe was in that too,
                        more or less. The incident which led to the rabbiting was, however, my show
                        entirely, and I confess to a certain pride in it. My presence of mind, as
                        well as my dramatic ability, was called into play, and I was pleased with
                        myself on both counts.</p>
                    <p>I was wandering in the orchard at dusk one evening, pushing through the long
                        grass and nettles, and trying to fix in my memory the way of the growing of
                        apple-boughs for the ghost's next illustration. The mists of October drifted
                        like wraiths among the trees, and the scent of wet earth had mingled with
                        itself the perfume of sadness and regret and memory. In spring the wet earth
                        smells of hope and joy and the green future. I had stood in contemplation
                        for some moments before the golden-pippin tree,<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7142-201"/> and was really beginning to know its gnarled face
                        by heart, when I heard a scratch and a squeak, and a voice said, “Got
                        'im!”</p>
                    <p>I moved cautiously round my tree. In the open space beyond the orchard the
                        wild rabbits have made their burrows, and here, grouped round one of the
                        rabbit-holes, were two men, three dogs, a boy, and several ferrets—the last
                        in bags.</p>
                    <p>I was still unseen. I reflected. If I called on these rabbit-thieves to
                        surrender, they would probably decline to do so on any terms. Indeed, why
                        should they? There were six of them, not counting the ferrets, and I was
                        only one. That was the point. If I had only been three—or even two! Could I
                        not be two, or even three? How could it be done? Arithmetic is a difficult
                        branch of science. I reflected again. The men had killed the rabbit,
                        replaced the net over the hole, and resumed their several stations at the
                        mouths of other burrows. The dusk was falling fast. I crept away for a dozen
                        yards. Then, assuming the gruffest voice at my command, and rolling my r's
                        to the highest pitch, I cried out: “George! Fred! Dick!” and faintly
                        answering in a tone I hoped would seem to come from a distance, I voiced a
                        couple of shrill, “Yes, sirs”; then with my stick I beat madly on the
                        underbushes and,<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7142-202"/> rushing forward, shouted
                        in the voice of my uncle's old Scotch gardener:</p>
                    <p>“Heck, lads; forrard wi' ye! We've gotten the rogues the noo!”</p>
                    <p>Had one of the rogues been a Scot—but, no, all were good Deptford-bred
                        ruffians. As I neared them, shouting, “Come on, my lads—come on!” my rogues
                        fled incontinently, followed by their boy and their dogs, leaving to me, as
                        prize, fifteen rabbit-nets, five ferrets in bags, and one in a burrow. This
                        last came out presently, creeping like a yellow snake, and looking round
                        with bright eyes and ever-moving head for his master. I captured him,
                        collected the nets and the bagged ferrets, and went back, chuckling, to
                        Chloe. A well-worn trick, but a good one—a relic of the old smuggling days,
                        a preventive-officer's stratagem. I deserve no credit for it, but I do think
                        I did the voices well.</p>
                    <p>This is all by way of prelude to our rabbiting. We housed our ferrets in the
                        stable and hung the nets in the kitchen. And it was Jim who suggested, one
                        Saturday afternoon when the October sun was burnishing the coppery leaves of
                        our beeches, and gilding the little quivering hearts that hang from the
                        silver birch, that we should “have some sport.” Bates was invited to join;
                        this seemed, as Yolande said, only his<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7142-203"/> due
                        as a professional ferret. Our tenant came with him. Yolande declined to join
                        the glad throng.</p>
                    <p>“I think it's cruel,” she said, shortly.</p>
                    <p>“But you eat rabbit-pie,” objected Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, and I eat mutton chops. But I'm not a butcher.”</p>
                    <p>“It's very exciting sport,” said our tenant. “And we shall probably catch
                        nothing.”</p>
                    <p>“Then doesn't that make your sport silly in fact as well as cruel in
                        aspiration?”</p>
                    <p>“Do come!” he said. “You can sit in your favorite apple-tree with a volume of
                        moral stories, and cheer us on by your presence and your
                        disapprobation.”</p>
                    <p>So Yolande established herself in the low, forked bough of the apple-tree
                        with a volume of Ruskin. “As near to moral stories as I can get,” she told
                        our tenant. But she sat with her pretty back towards the scene of our sport,
                        and refused even to turn her head and look at us.</p>
                    <p>Chloe, in spite of my warnings, was eagerly anxious to help. She was more
                        deft than any of us in staking the nets over the holes, and she handled the
                        ferrets lovingly, because they loved her, and that was because she always
                        fed them.</p>
                    <p>We had no dogs and no guns, and I felt guiltily unsportsmanlike. At last all
                        was ready; each<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7142-204"/> of us crouched by his
                        appointed rabbit-hole. I put in the handsomest ferret; he disappeared, and
                        we waited results in silence. Now and then we bent our heads to listen in
                        quite a professional manner, as though we had been real poachers, for some
                        sound of what might be happening underground. And nothing whatever seemed to
                        be happening. We grew cramped, and changed our positions. Yolande heard the
                        movement and called out, with insolent triumph, “Any sport?” Indignantly we
                        all said, “Hush!” and the weary work of listening began again. Then,
                        suddenly, just as hope had died in every breast, there was a rustle
                        underground, a scamper-rush, a piteous little scream of horror and fear, and
                        a small, fat gray rabbit bolted out of the earth into the net over the hole
                        where Chloe watched. She had it in her arms in an instant. Its feet were
                        caught in the net, but as she held it it ceased to struggle, and lay
                        paralyzed against her bodice.</p>
                    <p>“Let <emph>me</emph> kill it, mum,” said Bates.</p>
                    <p>“Or would <emph>you</emph> like to, mum?” asked Jim, kindly. “It was your
                        rabbit, so it was! You just hold it up by the ears like this, and hit it a
                        crack 'longside o' the head with the edge of your hand—so—”</p>
                    <p>But Chloe had fled, still clasping the rabbit, and leaving us to look
                        helplessly at each other.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7142-205"/>
                    <p>“Ladies are no good at sport,” said Bates, philosophically. “It's their
                        tender hearts, bless them—”</p>
                    <p>“Missus 'll let it loose in the garden, I shouldn't wonder,” said Jim, in
                        gloom.</p>
                    <p>“Better luck next time,” said the tenant, cheerfully.</p>
                    <p>I left them to recover the ferret and arrange another siege. I found Chloe by
                        the white-parlor fire stroking the rabbit, as it lay panting and wretched on
                        her knee.</p>
                    <p>“Well, spoil-sport?” I said.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Len, how could you—how could you let me? You knew what it would be like!
                        Oh, did you hear it scream? It was like a little, little baby that some one
                        was hurting! Don't go back to them. Promise me you'll never, never, never
                        hunt rabbits again!”</p>
                    <p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
                    <p>“I told you you wouldn't like it,” I said.</p>
                    <p>“I know, but you ought to have beaten me and locked me up, rather than let me
                        go! I didn't know, poor, poor little rabbity! I didn't know!”</p>
                    <p>“What are you going to do with it?”</p>
                    <p>“Keep it, of course,” she said, opening her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Wouldn't it be happier if we let it loose again in the orchard?”</p>
                    <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7142-206"/>
                    <p>“For some other ferret to go after? Never! Fancy running for your life with a
                        long, crawling horror coming after you in the black dark, all cruel teeth
                        and claws, and just when you think you are safe, and see the safe, green,
                        light world outside where you can run and hide, you rush into a net and get
                        beaten to death! You must give away the ferrets! You must! I won't bear
                        it!”</p>
                    <p>I shrugged my shoulders again. “Anyway,” I said, “the rabbit is slowly dying
                        of fright in your arms. He doesn't know when he is well off.”</p>
                    <p>I got a basket and some cabbage leaves. We shut in the rabbit and watched him
                        through the cracks of the basket till we saw him recover enough to
                        nibble.</p>
                    <p>“Now,” she said, ”if you care the least bit about me you'll go straight back
                        to those hateful people and tell them to stop. Yolande was quite right. She
                        nearly always is.”</p>
                    <p>I admitted that in this case Yolande had chosen the better part.</p>
                    <p>“And don't bring those hateful ferrets back. I don't want ever to see them
                        again.”</p>
                    <p>“But what am I to do with them?”</p>
                    <p>“I don't care,” said Chloe, with almost a sob; ”anything—give them away,
                        drown them, strangle them.”</p>
                    <pb xml:id="VAB7142-207"/>
                    <p> </p>
                    <pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7142-208"/>
                    <p>“Oh, Chloe! Chloe!” I said, “your own little ferrets that have eaten out of
                        your hand and climbed round your neck? Drown them? Strangle them? Never! I
                        will advertise them in the <title>Bazar and Mart</title> in exchange for
                        goldfish or anything useful, and Bates shall keep them till I find a
                        purchaser.”</p>
                    <p>“All right,” she said, impatiently, “only go now. Go! Or they'll have killed
                        another.”</p>
                    <p>They had killed three. The soft, fluffy bodies lay side by side on the brown
                        turf, and even as I came upon the scene there was a rustle and a scream—I
                        thought of Chloe, and I hated to hear it—and next moment Yolande—yes,
                        Yolande herself—rose from beside the hole with a live rabbit struggling in
                        her hands among meshes of net.</p>
                    <p>“Here,” she said, gently disengaging its helpless little feet from the
                        netting and holding it tip tenderly by the ears, “you kill it, Jim. I think
                        you do it quicker than the others. And that makes four.” She turned her back
                        on the executioner and met my eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Yolande,” I cried, “this cruel sport—”</p>
                    <p>“It's not really cruel,” she protested, “and it's very exciting. I'd rather
                        die like that myself than die slowly of starvation when I got too old to go
                        out after my food. That's the end of wild animals, you know, if we don't eat
                        them. Isn't<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7142-209"/> it?” She appealed almost
                        abjectly from me to the tenant, who said, “That's so!” And I knew she was
                        rehearsing those arguments by which he had drawn her down from her
                        apple-tree to share in the sport.</p>
                    <p>“I'm very sorry,” I said, “but the sport is now over. My wife decrees a
                        reprieve to the rabbits, and banishes the ferrets. Bates, I wish you'd cart
                        them off and get rid of them somehow.”</p>
                    <p>The sporting party exchanged blank glances. Yolande's was the only
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>“<emph>Well</emph>!” she said.</p>
                    <p>Jim and Bates collected the ferrets in a silence full, I knew, of disparaging
                        reflections on woman's folly.</p>
                    <p>Yolande and the tenant stood a moment talking before they strolled off
                        together, and I heard him asking her why she should not ride out on her
                        bicycle with him to see some coursing—only a thirty-mile ride.</p>
                    <p>“But I don't think I do approve of it, really,” she was saying, “not when I'm
                        cool and collected and in my right mind—”</p>
                    <p>“But you will not be cool and collected when you see the first hare get up.
                        You will be wild with excitement. You'll forget everything else.”</p>
                    <p>“I don't know that I want to.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, you do; you don't want to cultivate<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7142-210"/>
                        nerves. If you don't like sport—well, it's simple enough, and half the best
                        women there are don't, either. If you <emph>do</emph> like it—well, you do,
                        and so do the other half of the best women in the world. That's all there is
                        to it. And you <emph>do</emph> like sport. Look here, if I could get a man
                        to take on my work for Tuesday, we could start early, say about nine. Do say
                        you will.”</p>
                    <p>I did not hear what she said, for they had strolled off down the path that
                        leads to the moat, and when next I saw them they were engineering the leaky
                        punt under the middle arch of the old bridge. Yolande in her blue cloth and
                        fox fur was standing in an inch and a half of water, and hanging on to a
                        muddy punt-pole; the tenant was instructing her.</p>
                    <p>Yolande! I shrugged my shoulders for the third time that day, and I went in
                        to my wife. She was sitting by the fire in the beech-wood rocking-chair,
                        singing low to herself; the song sounded like “Bye, baby bunting.” I suppose
                        the rabbit put it into her head.</p>
                    <p>I never regretted that rabbit. In three days it was perfectly tame; in a week
                        it played with the cats and sat up on the hearth-rug, unconcernedly washing
                        its face. At the end of a fortnight it flopped after Chloe, in and out,
                        up-stairs and down-stairs, like a small and very plump<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7142-211"/> kangaroo. When the cats grew too catty in their
                        play the rabbit would turn round and use his deadly hind foot. They
                        presently learned to respect this, and the rabbit was master of the
                        hearth-rug.</p>
                    <p>Yolande went to see that coursing, I believe, though she never spoke to Chloe
                        of it. And she listened to tales of tigers from the tenant—more tales, and
                        less convincing, than I should have thought any Girton girl could have
                        borne. She also learned to take rose-cuttings, and did it without gloves. I
                        looked on in a frenzy of annoyance, which I hid, even—indeed, most of
                        all—from Chloe. The tenant is a man of ideas—but I never heard him talk
                        anything but the visible—concrete to Yolande. I felt a horrid suspicion that
                        he thought her a bit of a prig, and that he was actually daring to try to
                        “form her”; the audacity took my breath away. But Yolande was placid, and
                        seemed to breathe without effort.</p>
                    <p>Mindful of that scorned suggestion of my wife's on the night of the first
                        dinner-party at the cottage, I looked straight before me and cultivated an
                        air of seeing nothing. I sometimes wondered whether Yolande imagined that we
                        did not see anything, or whether she knew we saw anything, and did not care,
                        or whether<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7142-212"/> she really believed that there
                        was nothing to see. She had arranged, as usual, to personally conduct three
                        model young persons on a winter tour through the art treasures of Italy, and
                        her going was fixed for the week after Christmas. She had some private
                        pupils, and went up to struggle with them two or three times a week, but for
                        the most part she was with us. And I was glad to have her—first, because she
                        is ever a sight for sore eyes, and secondly, because I began to see that I
                        did not want either to give up my ghost-fathered pencil-work, nor yet, for
                        some obscure reason which I can't even indicate, to confess to Chloe that it
                        was not Yolande, but I, who had tinkered her drawings. My own work, my
                        writing, grew less and less important to me—only the <emph>Weekly
                            Wilderness</emph> still commanding the service of habit.</p>
                    <p>The curious change whose initial throes I had felt when first we came to the
                        Red House had worked in Chloe and in me, till now, while the house was
                        usually tidy to distraction, Chloe's wardrobes and chests were in the
                        wildest confusion.</p>
                    <p>“I know,” she said one day, when I opened a drawer and silently confronted
                        her with a swollen mass of lace, ribbons, handkerchiefs, scarfs, bead
                        necklaces, letters, collars, wristbands, brass-<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7142-213"/> headed nails, and the long-lost hammer, all
                        inextricably tangled up with the ball of twine I had been looking for—“I
                        know. You see, it is so important to keep the house tidy—and I
                            <emph>do</emph> tidy up.”</p>
                    <p>“You do, indeed,” I said, fishing up from the bottom of the drawer the
                        penknife that I had missed since last Tuesday week.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, I am so sorry. But I do forget so where things are.”</p>
                    <p>“Now, I don't. I never tidy up, but I always know where to find my pencils,
                        and I'm never in any doubt as to where I put the India rubber.”</p>
                    <p>“What do you want with India rubber, anyhow?” she asked, and I trembled for
                        my secret.</p>
                    <p>“I meant that you are,” I said, feebly.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps,” she said, “if you would tidy up a little sometimes, I could keep
                        the insides of things tidier. Let's have a grand clearing up now, this
                        instant minute, and then I really <emph>will</emph> try! I must learn to be
                        tidy, Len, before I'm too old to learn anything.”</p>
                    <p>We did have a grand clearing up, beginning with that corner drawer. When all
                        was neat—the scarfs folded, the ribbons rolled, the handkerchiefs restored
                        to the historic handkerchief-case—I tried the other drawer. It was
                        locked.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, that's tidy,” she hastily assured me.</p>
                    <pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7142-214"/>
                    <p>“What's in it?” I asked, idly.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, nothing much—only little things. I'll show you some day when we've
                        nothing to do but to be kind to each other. Now we'll go and clear out the
                        sideboard cupboards and all the rest of it.”</p>
                    <p>We did. We found many things—the lost corkscrew and the button-hook and the
                            <title>Nineteenth Centuries</title> that were missing. It took us all
                        day, and when it was done there was a place for nearly everything, and
                        everything that had a place was in it. The residue loomed hateful on a tray
                        in the hall—odd stoppers, screws, knobs, handles of knives, curtain
                        rings—all the litter that has no place and that one cannot bear to throw
                        away. We looked at it in despair. Then I caught up the tray.</p>
                    <p>“Come, light of my eyes,” I cried, exulting; “there is only one thing that we
                        need—a lumber-room.</p>
                    <p>We toiled joyously to the top of the house, I with the tray and Chloe with
                        the little copper coal-scuttle whose broken handle we meant to get mended
                        when we could afford it. We chose a fair-sized room, out of the many disused
                        ones, opened the shutters, and dumped down our treasures on the floor. Our
                        old tendency to furnish one room at the expense of another came
                            irresistibly<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7142-215"/> sistibly upon us, and we
                        ransacked the house, carrying off to the lumber-room everything we could
                        possibly not want. The house looked very bare when we had done, and for
                        weeks I found myself toiling up those stairs in search of some necessary for
                        one of us which the other had confiscated as “rubbish”—but we certainly had
                        a most impressive lumber-room.</p>
                    <p>“And now,” said my wife, looking round with pride, “clearing up will be
                        simply a pleasure.”</p>
                    <p>Yolande was severe as ever when she came back from watching a foot-ball match
                        at the Rectory Field, and found us, very dirty and very happy, resting on
                        the stairs.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Babes in the Wood,” she said, “did they invent a new, pretty game to
                        waste their time on?”</p>
                    <p>“I'd rather waste my time at a game I can play than one I can only look on
                        at,” said I, severely. “Sit down; there are plenty of stairs.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you. As to games, c'est selon,” she said, unfastening her furs.
                        “By-the-way, before I go to southern climes I should like to render an
                        account of my stewardship. I'll write it down. Give me a pencil, somebody,
                        and the back of an envelope.”</p>
                    <p>She wrote busily for some time, then handed<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7142-216"/>
                        ed the paper to Chloe, who took it in her little grimy hand and read
                        aloud:</p>

                    <p>“Yolande, you never have!”</p>
                    <p>She rose and bowed. “Go on,” she said; and Chloe, merely pausing to embrace
                        her, went on:</p>

                    <p>“Oh, Yolande, this is too much! You really are a genius! And only one
                        failure.”</p>
                    <p>“And that was half a success,” said I. “Oh, Yolande, what a glorious baking
                        of beautiful pies! And yet you said you would never have a finger in any pie
                        again.”</p>
                    <p>“I can't help it,” she pleaded. ”I was born to it. Give me another

                    <p>“There's your yearly income! How's that for high?” she asked, flashing a
                        glance of triumph at us.</p>
                    <p>We had known well enough that our income was increasing, that we no longer
                        had, as Chloe said, to look all round every shilling. We had told Yolande,
                        gleefully, the amount of every check we had received. But we had kept no
                        accounts. She had.</p>
                    <p>We all three fell into each other's arms, or something very like it.</p>
                    <p>“You shall have that book of Beardsley drawings for a Christmas present,
                        Len,” said my wife, “and Yolande shall have a gold horseshoe brooch with
                        turkisses in it, as becomes a sporting lady.”</p>
                    <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7142-218"/>
                    <p>“It wouldn't become a bailiff and house agent,” said Yolande.</p>
                    <p>“Never mind. You shall have a bangle with a double dangling heart—ours—and an
                        inscription inside that would get you a situation anywhere. And Chloe shall
                        have—” I stopped.</p>
                    <p>“What, Len?”</p>
                    <p>“A very beautiful present, indeed. Something we never thought we'd have. No,
                        I won't tell you. It's going to be a surprise.”</p>
                    <p>Yolande had taken off her veil, folded it very carefully, and driven three
                        little turquoise-headed pins through it. Now she said, “I'm beginning to
                        think that surprises are the best things in life—especially when one
                        surprises one's self.”</p>
                    <p>“Have you surprised yourself lately?” Chloe asked, picking up the rabbit by
                        its ears. It had followed her, as usual.</p>
                    <p>“Very much.” I held my breath. The very cigarette trembled in my dusty
                        fingers. Could it be that already that tenant had taught Yolande to be
                        surprised at herself? A sigh of relief broke from me as she went on: “I am
                        absolutely astounded—and charmed too, of course—at my own cleverness. But
                        all this is a swan-song. I shall have my finger in no more pies—for good or
                        ill. My career of usefulness is at an end. Henceforth I shall be a female
                        fogy; never a pie shall<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7142-219"/> be the worse nor
                        the better for me. I shall cram young geese. No more and no less. Mark my
                        words, I have gone up like the rocket, and like the stick I shall come
                        down—if I have not already.” She took off her hat, and twisted the blue
                        velvet and fur in her hands. “Mine is indeed a dark and terrible lot!” she
                        said, smiling brilliantly at us. Then without more words she withdrew.</p>
                    <p>Chloe sighed, not sadly: “Poor, dear Yolande! I do really believe she doesn't
                        know what is the matter with her.”</p>
                    <p>“And what is?” I ventured.</p>
                    <p>“Make your own diagnosis.”</p>
                    <p>“Yours is?”</p>
                    <p>Silence.</p>
                    <p>“What is the matter with her?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, nothing! Len.”</p>
                    <p>“Well?”</p>
                    <p>“I think I'm glad.”</p>
                    <p>“What of?”</p>
                    <p>“About her.”</p>
                    <p>“What about her?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don't be tiresome!”</p>
                    <p>“What, do words fail you in a crisis? Mine are at flood.”</p>
                    <p>“No, don't! You know what I mean.”</p>
                    <p>“I understand you to mean that you rejoice to<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7142-220"/> see Othello's occupation gone. You are glad that your friend has
                        renounced her dearest pastime and will finger her neighbors' pies no
                        more.”</p>
                    <p>“Dog in the manger!” said my wife.</p>
                    <p>“No,” I said, eagerly. “I'm almost sure that I'm not quite sorry.”</p>
                    <p>“For what?”</p>
                    <p>“For her.”</p>
                    <p>“Why should you be?”</p>
                    <p>“Because I see,” I answered, slowly, “what you mean me to see—whether she
                        knows it or not, she'll soon be baking her own pies.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said Chloe; “she'll understand then.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said I; “one understands many things when one bakes at home.”</p>

                    <p>“<hi>UGH-R-R-R!</hi>” I remarked, as we sat down to breakfast.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose it is,” said Chloe, pretending to shiver. “The Bandbox was warmer,
                        certainly, but not much. Why do people make so much fuss about being too
                        cold and too hot? Isn't it odd that they've never found out the great
                        truth—that one has to be cold in the winter and hot in the summer? And if
                        one has to be cold, how much warmer it is to be cold here than in the
                        Bandbox!”</p>
                    <p>“You mean that great possessions warm the cockles o your heart,” I said;
                        “that's because you're all soul. As for me, I must warm my hands in the
                        tea-cozy before I can carve the eggs.”</p>
                    <p>The white parlor, with its dark-panelled walls, its olive-green curtains, its
                        sparkling brass and silver, and nothing white about it save the ceiling<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7142-222"/> ing and the table-cloth, was a delightful
                        picture of a breakfast-room. Chloe's loose gown of turquoise-colored soft
                        stuff with its brown furry trimmings became her to distraction. I told her
                        so.</p>
                    <p>“But the tip of your pretty nose is pink,” I said. “It was quite white—with
                        rage, I believe—the day you bit me so about my shaving-brush. Do you
                        remember? And then the letter came enclosing the Red House and all our
                        affluence! You had on some muslin thing that day—”</p>
                    <p>She shivered, almost in earnest this time, and poured out the coffee.</p>
                    <p>“Don't talk of muslin!” she said. “Look, isn't it fairyland? Only it's a
                        little hard to believe that our green garden has only gone to sleep, and
                        means to wake up again in the spring.”</p>
                    <p>A light veil of snow lay on our green garden now, and on the thatched roof of
                        the old summer-house and on the sun-dial's face, whose sentimental
                        expression had decided my wife to decide me to decide to live at the Red
                        House. The snow lay in sheets, like cotton-wool, on the flat tops of the
                        cedars; and the ivy round the windows, the creepers on the old arches, and
                        the leaves of the tall box hedge were all outlined in sparkling white.</p>
                    <pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7142-223"/>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> a little different,” I said; “that day, when you
                        wore—well, I won't, then—and we had haddock for breakfast, and the letter
                        came. By-the-way, my hands are warm enough to open letters now.”</p>
                    <p>There were only two. One was a bill for repairs to the roof—the roof, now
                        spread with snow, where one warm, wet morning we had fought a flood with
                        brooms and a dust-pan; a bill that did not discompose me, for I was used to
                        that roof. No living plumber could make its repairs permanent. The other
                        letter was type-written, and that by a somewhat inexperienced hand. It read
                        thus: <quote>

                            <p>I; am dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Edward Turnbull Hon. Sec.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Such was the letter. The more obvious orthographical errors had been
                        carefully corrected with blue pencil, but, even so, the document was a
                        remarkable one. Chloe read it, taking absent bites at her buttered
                        toast.</p>
                    <p>“Mad?” she queried, calmly.</p>
                    <p>“I don't know; the letter's very conventionally worded, except in one or two
                        odd places. Is it possible that a genuine society could possibly employ such
                        a ghastly rough-sketch of a typist?”</p>
                    <p>“The letter's not signed,” she remarked. “The secretary's name is typed as
                        well as the rest.”</p>
                    <p>“I knew a solemn ass named Turnbull, once,” I reflected, “but I thought he'd
                        got into a bank somewhere in Kent—Tonbridge or Dartford, or something. He
                        used to fool around with brass rubbings and dates and archæological
                        bores—”</p>
                    <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7142-225"/>
                    <p>“I expect it's the same man,” she said, indifferently. “But we don't want the
                        nasty society bothering here, do we? Write and tell him there's nothing to
                        see, and no one really important ever lived here till we did.”</p>
                    <p>“I don't know,” I said. “I wish I could be sure. Blackheath seems an unlikely
                        place for it. If we were Woolwich, now, <emph>that</emph> simply bristles
                        with improving societies; but I've a sort of idea this is a working-men's
                        society. If the poor beggars have got a holiday on purpose, and are really
                        interested—or think they are—it seems a bit piggy not to let them, doesn't
                        it? We can keep a lookout from the loafery window and see that they don't
                        get into any mischief. They only want to look at the house ‘from the
                        outside.’”</p>
                    <p>“I suppose they give an address?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes; Morden House, Blackheath. It sounds decent. I'm almost certain it's a
                        workman's club. I'll write and tell them they can come. You don't really
                        mind?”</p>
                    <p>“I'm not wholly a piggy-wig. But that letter's odd, all the same. Perhaps
                        it's from a gang of thieves who want to come and see how the shutters are
                        fastened.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, they can't see that from the garden. Madam, I am beginning to realize
                        that I am a<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7142-226"/> proud man the day. Think of
                        our position six months ago. Who would have wished to come and inspect,
                        ‘from the outside, of course,’ our late lamented Bandbox? And now we are
                        lords of the manor, holding the power of life and death over the field-days
                        of antiquarian societies.”</p>
                    <p>“What I don't like,” she went on, quite unappeased by this feudal picture,
                        “is that about the skating. Why should antiquaries want to skate?”</p>
                    <p>“Now to me,” I rejoined, “that's the most convincing touch of all. Of course
                        these workmen don't often get a holiday, and they want to make the most of
                        it. ‘If the frost holds’ is a charming touch. It's hardly begun yet.”</p>
                    <p>It did not hold. I signified to Mr. Edward Turnbull my gracious consent, and
                        from that moment the snow began to melt, and the weather to settle itself
                        down into something quite as warm and sunny as an English April, and far
                        warmer than many an English May. A stray furze-bush or two at the end of our
                        paddock broke into golden flower, and the skylarks sang in the pale blue
                        above the orchard. The 20th was a day of cloudless beauty, and even in the
                        midst of my mental congratulations to the members of the Antiquarian Society
                        on their royal weather, I found room for a pang of sympathy<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7142-227"/> pathy for those among them who might have had
                        their skates ground.</p>
                    <p>I recurred again that day, I remember, to our old life at the Bandbox. We
                        were sitting in the loafery, now made cosey with curtains and a big wood
                        fire. Chloe sat sewing in her rocking-chair. She had had some verses that
                        morning, and, bad as they were, they had pleased her. There were seven
                        stanzas, I remember. The first two were quite ordinary, and the other five
                        got sillier and sillier, till at the end they were a mere jingle of
                        nonsense—a sort of nursery rhyme, mostly written in the “little language.”
                        The poem—Chloe really did call it a poem—began something like this:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>TO CHLOE AT WORK</p>
                        <l>When Chloe sings</l>
                        <l>And sews and swings,</l>
                        <l>Rocked in her guardian angel's wings;</l>
                        <l>When with dear, delicate finger-tips</l>
                        <l>She cuts and measures, sews and snips;—</l>
                        <l>Silent I worship at a shrine</l>
                        <l>Lighted for me, and warmed for mine,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">By Chloe's eyes and lips.</l>
                        <l>For what she knows,</l>
                        <l>And what she sews,</l>
                        <l>And all the hope that grows and blows</l>
                        <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7142-228"/>
                        <l>About her sewing, twine and twist,</l>
                        <l>And veil her in a rainbow mist;</l>
                        <l>Until I rub my eyes and say,</l>
                        <l>“Oh, can it be there was a day</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">When Chloe was unkissed?”</l>
                    </quote>
                    <p>She liked it all, even the nonsense of the last five stanzas, and she said
                        that she liked it none the less because it happened to be written on the
                        backs of a green-grocer's bill, the voting-card of a candidate for the
                        school board, and two odd envelopes.</p>
                    <p>She said: “It is very pretty, Len. I didn't know you ever noticed whether I
                        was sewing or not.”</p>
                    <p>“You don't know my observant nature,” I said, “and after all these years of
                        married life, too.”</p>
                    <p>“It's more than one year, anyway,” she said.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remember the day when you made me decide to leave the dear
                        Bandbox?”</p>
                    <p>“Shall I ever forget it?”</p>
                    <p>“And that other dear day when you invented the loafery and we looked at the
                        bars?”</p>
                    <p>“Let's look at them now,” she cried, jumping up and dropping scissors,
                        thimble, tapemeasure, and a mass of lace and muslin. When I had picked
                        everything up we went to the window. The creeper's leaves were gone now,
                            and<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7142-229"/> we stood between dull red curtains
                        and looked out on the misty garden, where the dead leaves lay, patches of
                        wet gold and brown in the faint sunlight, and where a robin on a leafless
                        apple-tree was singing his very best, and pretending to the rooks in the
                        elms that he was a thrush disguised in a scarlet waistcoat.</p>
                    <p>“Those Antiquarian brutes,” I said, presently, “they'll be here directly. By
                        Jove! they <emph>are</emph> here. They look horribly small. Can it be that
                        the Junior Blackheath only admits dwarfs?”</p>
                    <p>“Those can't be the Antiquaries,” Chloe cried. “Why, Len, they look like
                        children! Lots and lots of them. What can they want? They look like a slice
                        of a strayed, frayed school treat. And they've all got books, and they don't
                        seem to have got any grown-up people with them. Oh, do go and turn them
                        out!”</p>
                    <p>“I'll go and find out what they want—”</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes, and they'll say they're botanizing, or geologizing, or something,
                        and you'll let them stay, like you did the boys that wanted conquerors off
                        the chestnut-trees, and overran everything. I've not forgotten it; I'll go
                        myself.”</p>
                    <p>She ran down the stairs, slipped her feet into the wooden sabots that she
                        keeps for sudden winter garden excursions, and stumped off<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7142-230"/> angrily down the path under the cedars. I took a
                        short-cut between Jim's celery-trenches. Chloe is terrible in her wrath, but
                        if it grows too hot it boils over in tears of rage; and I did not wish Chloe
                        to cry, and I not there.</p>
                    <p>The invaders were grouped round the sundial. All had their backs to us, and
                        one of them was reading aloud. I caught a few words:</p>
                    <p>“....told the time when Charles the First was beheaded, and recorded the
                        death-devouring progress of the Great Plague and the Fire of London. There
                        is no doubt the sun often shone even in those devastating occasions, so we
                        may picture—”</p>
                    <p>Then the reader heard the unmistakable threat in the emphatic stump, stump of
                        Chloe's wooden shoes, and stopped short. Her eyes were angry, her mouth
                        expressed inhospitable intentions. I thought I heard a murmur of, “Oh,
                        Crikey!” from the reader, but the next moment he had stepped towards my wife
                        and taken off his cap with an oddly graceful flourish. He was a boy; there
                        were other boys, who followed his lead in cap-doffing. There were girls,
                        too, rosy-faced little girls in highwayman coats and scarlet
                        Tam-o'-Shanters. The whole invading company were, as Chloe had said,
                        “children.” And all wore spectacles.</p>
                    <pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7142-231"/>
                    <p>“Do you know that this is a private garden?” said Chloe, severely. “You are
                        trespassing, you know.” Her voice is very pretty, even when she is angry,
                        and she was not nearly so angry as she had been before the boys took their
                        caps off.</p>
                    <p>“It's not <emph>your</emph> garden, is it?” asked the smallest boy of all,
                        goggling at her through his spectacles, and speaking in an off-hand but
                        perfectly agreeable manner. One of the girls shook him gently, and bade him
                        shut up.</p>
                    <p>“We're most awfully sorry,” said the boy who had been reading. “We wouldn't
                        have come if we'd thought you'd mind, but we've got a pass, so I thought it
                        was all right. Here, hold my spectacles half a sec., Alice, and I'll find
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>The prettiest of the red-capped girls took the spectacles, and the boy felt
                        in several pockets, while I drew near to offer Chloe my moral support.</p>
                    <p>“Here it is!” he said, at last, disentangling a dingy paper from a mass of
                        string, matches, envelopes, putty, and cobbler's wax, and, with really a
                        rather nice bow, he handed to Chloe—my letter to the Antiquarian
                        Society!</p>
                    <p>“But this was not meant for <emph>you</emph>,” she said. “This is to Mr.
                        Turnbull—”</p>
                    <pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7142-232"/>
                    <p>“That was my fault,” said a younger boy—a thin, pale, anxious-looking child.
                        “We tossed up who should copy out the letter on Albert's uncle's
                        type-writer, and I was thinking about something else, so I copied it, name
                        and all.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe put her hands to her head with a gesture of despair. I said: “Just
                        think a minute. Remember, we've no idea what all this is about. Just tell
                        us, right away from the beginning, how you came to be here, and what you
                        want.”</p>
                    <p>There was a silence. Then the eldest girl said, “Oswald, you tell.”</p>
                    <p>The boy who had been reading twisted his cap, and stood uneasily on one foot.
                        But almost at once he planted his feet firmly on the ground and began,
                        looking Chloe straight in the eyes with a most disarming frankness.</p>
                    <p>“First of all, we are very sorry the lady is vexed, and we beg her
                        pardon.”</p>
                    <p>“That's all right,” said Chloe, unexpectedly. “Go on.”</p>
                    <p>“Well—when we were staying in the country some Antiquaries wrote to Albert's
                        uncle—this is Albert”—he pushed forward a shy boy in velvet
                        knickerbockers—“and asked him to let them come and see his house. And we
                        thought we should be feeling a bit slack in the<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7142-233"/> holidays, so we thought we'd play at being
                        antiquaries. And Albert's uncle showed us this place once from the train
                        when we were going to Bexley Heath, and he said some great person lived here
                        once, and it was a historic place, and we can't remember who it was. And he
                        said a clever writer lived here now, and he told us the name. So we wrote to
                        ask leave to come, and you gave it right enough.”</p>
                    <p>The voice was reproachful.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” I said, completely melted by this unexpected recognition of my—or the
                        ghost's—talent as a writer. “Are you Mr. Edward Turnbull?”</p>
                    <p>“Rather not”—his tone was somewhat injured. “I was coming to that. We decided
                        to copy out the letter that the real Antiquity secretary sent to Albert's
                        uncle, and Noël had to do it, because we tossed up about it, and he lost.
                        And he got thinking of a poem he's writing, and copied it, name and all—and
                        only remembered it after we'd licked the stamp for the letter. So we thought
                        it didn't matter. And if you'd rather we'd been Mr. Turnbull, you wouldn't
                        have if you'd seen how thin his legs are, and how he couldn't laugh because
                        his mouth was so tight.”</p>
                    <p>“I'd much rather have you,” said Chloe, smiling<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7142-234"/> ing; and as she smiled I could see how deeply all
                        present fell in love with her on the instant. “I'm sorry I didn't
                        understand. We won't interfere any more. You'd like to go on reading your
                        papers. Who wrote them?”</p>
                    <p>“We've each done one,” said the eldest girl—she was a little prim, and not so
                        pretty as the others—”only mine is all out of a book, because it is so
                        difficult to think of things.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you always wear spectacles?” I asked.</p>
                    <p>They all laughed. It was a very pleasant sound, this peal of young laughter
                        in our old garden.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no!” said the prettiest girl, “only to make us look like learned
                        antiquities—antiquaries, I mean. It was an awful bother collecting them all;
                        some of them have no glass in.”</p>
                    <p>“One more question,” I said. “If you're not Edward Turnbull, who are
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>“We're the Bastables,” the biggest boy said, with a sort of shy pride, as if
                        he were confessing, in his modesty's despite, to royal lineage. “I'm Oswald,
                        and these are Alice and Dora; Noël's the one who typed the letter; and this
                        shaver is H.O.; and these are Daisy and Denny Foulkes; and Albert Morrison I
                        told you about before.”</p>
                    <p>“You'll have lunch with us, won't you?” asked Chloe, abruptly, picking up her
                        blue train<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7142-235"/> and fixing her feet in her
                        wooden shoes. “I don't think there'll be much, but we can make out with
                        bread and jam—”</p>
                    <p>“I like you,” said the smallest boy, before the others could answer. “I like
                        you very much, indeed, and I'll have lunch with you, whatever it is.”</p>
                    <p>The others murmured thanks, and we left them to their play.</p>
                    <p>“Aren't they perfect dears?” said Chloe, when we were out of earshot. “I
                        don't like the Morrison boy, but the others are lovely. Why aren't all
                        children nice?”</p>
                    <p>“They all are—if they have nice grown-ups belonging to them,” I said,
                        enunciating lightly a tremendous dogma. “But, darling and reckless one, do
                        you know that there's nothing in the house but cold neck of mutton, and even
                        that, if I remember right, is invidiously distinguished as being
                            <emph>not</emph> the best end?”</p>
                    <p>“I know,” she said; “but you must go up to Elmhurst and get things: tinned
                        tongue—children always adore tongue—and candied pineapple and tangerine
                        oranges in silver paper, and nuts, and bananas. Oh, I do think children are
                        so nice! I wish these weren't so big. The smallest boy, the one they call
                        H.O., he's simply a duck.”</p>
                    <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7142-236"/>
                    <p>“Oswald for my money,” said I, “and Alice! Make a list of what I'm to get,
                        and I'll be off. It's half-past twelve now.”</p>
                    <p>I left Chloe laying the table for eleven in the white parlor. When I came
                        back the cloth was spread, but Chloe had vanished. I found her in the garden
                        submerged to the shoulders in a wave of children, and she carried nine pairs
                        of spectacles in her hand. We all went in to lunch. I was now a mere
                        outsider. Chloe, by some art unknown to me, had become one of the children,
                        and was the most childlike child of all. The others really were not bad
                        children. I don't think I ever met any so full of enthusiastic energy. As a
                        permanency, they might have been a little wearing, for, strong in Chloe's
                        extraordinary assumption of <foreign xml:lang="fre">esprit de
                            corps</foreign>, they now threw away all shyness, and talked to us with
                        simple directness of adventures, of contemporary literature, of the ways of
                        Providence, and their own vital ambitions. They had a very full flow of
                        conversation, and a much larger vocabulary than I remember having at their
                        age. What struck me most was their confident assumption that, now we knew
                        them, we could not help liking them; and the assumption was, I own,
                        justified. This assumption was particularly marked in Oswald. He
                            evidently<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7142-237"/> thought a good deal of
                        himself, but, as I could not but reluctantly acknowledge, with some justice!
                        They were extremely “free in their talk,” as Mary said afterwards, but never
                        vulgar. And they were very much funnier than they meant to be. The lunch,
                        for which Chloe had madly brought out the best green-and-gold table-centre,
                        charmed them. I had not thought that Chloe could be so thoroughly inspired
                        with any menu. When no one could eat any more, the children looked at each
                        other, and Dora, the prim one, said, quite unconscious of the evidence of
                        rehearsal with which her speech bristled,</p>
                    <p>“Thank you very much for letting us come, and for having us to lunch.”</p>
                    <p>“And for getting such a jolly lunch,” said the pale boy. “I think it is
                        splendid. If you will give me a piece of paper and a pencil I will write you
                        a piece of poetry about it.”</p>
                    <p>While I was getting these I heard the prim child say anxiously to Chloe:</p>
                    <p>“I hope you don't mind. He <emph>will</emph> do it. We can't stop him.”</p>
                    <p>“It comes of his having bronchitis so often, <emph>I</emph> think,” said the
                        stout child they called H.O. “It isn't really his fault.”</p>
                    <p>There was an awkward pause while the pale child sucked my pencil and rolled
                        his eyes. He<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7142-238"/> made the most shocking
                        grimaces I ever saw, but when Chloe turned anxiously to Oswald, he said,</p>
                    <p>“It's all right; he's not ill; it's only the poetry working out of him.”</p>
                    <p>Presently he stopped writing, folded the paper very small, and said suddenly
                        and earnestly,</p>
                    <p>“Have you got a secret staircase here?”</p>
                    <p>We owned our indigence in this respect.</p>
                    <p>“We have at the Moat House,” he said. “Have you explored your house
                        thoroughly?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I think so,” said Chloe, with a glorious inspiration, adding, “but you
                        may explore it if you like. Don't make too much hay, that's all! Off you
                        go!”</p>
                    <p>Noël pressed the paper into Chloe's hand and they rushed from the room, and
                        as they went I heard the words “jolly good sort.”</p>
                    <p>I drew a long breath.</p>
                    <p>“What a whirlwind!” I said.</p>
                    <p>“Children do make a difference in a house,” said Chloe, wistfully.</p>
                    <p>“They do,” I said, kissing her ears, “all the difference.”</p>
                    <p>She gave me a doubtful glance.</p>
                    <p>“My dear little old wife,” I said, “people might think themselves lucky if
                        their children were half as nice as these.”</p>
                    <pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7142-239"/>
                    <p>“They are dears, great dears,” she said, and then we read Noël's poem:</p>

                    <p>“Two poems in one day,” I said. “Oh, Chloe, beware of vanity.”</p>
                    <p>“The dear!” she said. “And, Len, it's not half bad, is it? What extraordinary
                        children!”</p>
                    <p>I could hear the wave of children surging wildly about the house. I lighted a
                        cigarette, and strove for calm. I seemed to have been living in the embrace
                        of a friendly tornado.</p>
                    <p>Chloe looked at me anxiously.</p>
                    <pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7142-240"/>
                    <p>“They <emph>are</emph> dears,” she said, for the fourth time. “I do hope they
                        haven't worried you!”</p>
                    <p>“Worry's not the word,” said I. “They have electrified, bewildered,
                        enlightened. I never saw children with such energetic enthusiasms. The
                        Morrison boy is a muff; but the others, they are very trusting. The world
                        must have been kind to them.”</p>
                    <p>“Anybody would be,” she said, “and I hope the world always will.”</p>
                    <p>There was a silence in the house. I went to see whether the exploring party
                        had drowned itself in the rain-water cistern, which is just the sort of
                        thing that kind of child would do. No; Mary said they were exploring the
                        cellars. As she spoke I heard a thunderous report reverberating below. Our
                        cellars are large and vaulted; from recollections of my childhood, I could
                        conceive that they might seem well worth exploring. But I had not all
                        Chloe's confidence in these strange children. From the little I had seen of
                        them I felt that they were quite capable of organizing a Guy Fawkes play,
                        and carrying it out with scrupulous, enthusiastic fidelity if one of their
                        number should happen, as seemed only too likely, to have any matches and
                        loose gunpowder in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>Yolande had just come from town, and by<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7142-241"/> a
                        curious coincidence our tenant had come on the same train. I left them
                        talking to Chloe, and went down the cellar steps. Half-way down I was met by
                        an incredibly cobwebby boy.</p>
                    <p>“I was just coming after you,” he said, eagerly. “Do you know, we've found a
                        door behind some beer-barrels, and Oswald and Denny got in from behind under
                        the dining-room floor; they're hammering on the other side of the door now.
                        There are barrels in front of the door. We rolled one away. Did it make an
                        awful row? They say there's all sorts of things inside. Did you know it was
                        there? And please can we have a candle and matches? We've used all
                        ours.”</p>
                    <p>One-half at least of my foreboding was justified. I wondered where they had
                        dropped the hot heads of all the matches they had used.</p>
                    <p>I got some candles and matches, and the cobwebbed child, whose name appeared
                        to be Dickie, led me to a cellar where barrels were piled. Behind them I
                        could just discern the shadowy outline of a door, from which came an
                        intermittent knocking and voices:</p>
                    <p>“Have you got him?”</p>
                    <p>“Can you get the barrels away?”</p>
                    <p>“Can you get the door open, or shall we come back under the floor for the
                        candles? It's a<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7142-242"/> beastly tight fit, and
                        I've split my waistcoat as it is.”</p>
                    <p>“The last match we lighted we saw some chairs and a mangle.”</p>
                    <p>There were three boys still in evidence, and the tenant had followed me to
                        see the sport. The girls were as energetic as the boys, and one by one we
                        rolled the barrels away. Curious that Chloe and I had never looked behind
                        those barrels. The door was not fastened. It opened easily, and a shower of
                        dust and cobwebs fell on the heads of the explorers who first pressed
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>From my soul I congratulated these children. Even to such an adventurous band
                        as this an adventure so exciting could not happen every day.</p>
                    <p>They were quite right. There was furniture in the inner cellar, odds and ends
                        stowed away, to make room for new stuff, by busy, thrifty hands now long
                        since folded in lavish idleness—hands that, in their life-day, could never
                        bear to destroy or to waste.</p>
                    <p>We carried the things up-stairs—all but the vast box-mangle and one other
                        thing which I said I would carry up myself later.</p>
                    <p>We bore into the kitchen, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Chloe and
                        Yolande, and the contemptuous<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7142-243"/> temptuous
                        ones of Mary, a full-sized oak dresser—in four pieces; five chestnut-wood
                        chairs, more or less dilapidated; an oak settle—the seat was broken, but,
                        oh, how our hearts rejoiced in the severe beauty of its panelled back! three
                        ladder-backed chairs—seats gone; a large gate-table; an elm kneading-trough;
                        and the magnificent wreck of a carved four-post bedstead!</p>
                    <p>The children were as delighted as we were, which is saying a good deal.</p>
                    <p>“I said we would,” said the poet, triumphantly. “It's not gold, but it
                            <emph>is</emph> nice. You have lots of nice things. I like the way you
                        stick up warming-pans and brass candlesticks instead of plush brackets and
                        crinkly ornaments.”</p>
                    <p>A most discerning child, truly! When the children had been partially cleaned,
                        our tenant invited them all to tea at his cottage. Yolande and Chloe went to
                        help.</p>
                    <p>When they were gone I went down to the cellar and fetched the thing I said I
                        would carry myself. I bore it up to the loafery and cleaned it, and polished
                        it, and mended it a little, and set it by the hearth, in the glow of the
                        fire; and that evening when Yolande and the tenant were deep in chess, I
                        beckoned Chloe, and took her up to the loafery, and, lighting the candles,
                        bade her look.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="VAB7142-244"/>
                    <p> </p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7142-245"/>
                    <p>“Oh, Len,” she cried, throwing her arms round my neck, “it's miles better
                        than the one we go to look at in the shop in Great Portland Street!”</p>
                    <p>“I meant to give you <emph>that</emph> for a Christmas present,” I said, “but
                        this is better.” She fell on her knees beside it.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, look at the dear little daisy carving on the sides, and the little
                        strong panelled hood, and the rockers! Oh, Len, it <emph>is</emph> lovely!
                        Where did it come from?”</p>
                    <p>“It was in the cellar,” I said. “Do you like it? No; it's absurd to thank me;
                        thank those outrageous, dear Bastable children.”</p>
                    <p>“I will,” she said, coming nearer to me. “Len—I've said it before, I know,
                        but they <emph>are</emph> dears—and they shall come and see the cradle they
                        found when—when it's better worth looking at.”</p>
                    <p>Presently my wife took me into our room, and, unlocking the corner drawer,
                        showed me all that was in it. Little, little things.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE ROOM FOR CONFIDENCES</head>
                    <p><hi>CHRISTMAS</hi> in the Red House was charming. It made us feel like
                        pictures on Christmas cards. Chloe and I flatly refused to have anything to
                        do with the decorations. We had had enough of evergreens when we decorated
                        our drawing-room with the loops and swags for the great house-warming party.
                        And rather than we would touch box or yew or laurel or holly again, the Red
                        House should go undecorated. We said so, but our tenant insisted that no
                        decorations at Christmas would be the first step towards the downfall of the
                        British constitution and the death-blow to the naval supremacy of
                        England.</p>
                    <p>“Let me do it,” he said. “I've had my Christmases in such odd, out-of-the-way
                        places—ships and ranches and diamiond-fields—I haven't put up a sprig of
                        holly since I was a school-boy. Miss Riseborough, you'll help me, I
                        know.”</p>
                    <pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7142-247"/>
                    <p>“I know I won't,” said Yolande. “I never do things with my fingers. I'll
                        inspect and direct and overlook, and earn the wages of superintendence, if
                        you'll make Mary bake them—”</p>
                    <p>“Scones, I suppose,” said Chloe. “There are heaps of string in the
                        cellarette, and don't take my best scissors—the old ones are in the table
                        drawer.”</p>
                    <p>“How good we are growing,” I said. “Fancy you knowing where anything is.”</p>
                    <p>“We're reformed characters,” she answered, gayly. “Where are the pencils and
                        the India rubber?”</p>
                    <p>I felt a pang. Was it possible that Chloe had any suspicion? Could she
                        possibly guess that it was I, and not Yolande, who finished drawing her
                        pictures for her? No, she certainly could not. And I more than half wanted
                        to tell her my secret. Yet I could not make up my mind to part with it. I
                        had nursed it in my heart till it had grown very dear and precious.</p>
                    <p> We left Yolande enthroned on the settle, di recting the labors of our
                        tenant, but when the gong summoned us to tea and the
                        wages-of-superintendence-scones, we found our tenant working at one end of
                        the wreath, and Yolande busy at the other. It was not such a very long
                        wreath as to have needed two pairs of hands, <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7142-248"/> either. To do Miss Riseborough justice, she
                        looked very much ashamed of this lapse from the principles of a
                        lifetime.</p>
                    <p>“My hands are very dirty,” she made haste to say, “and I think that many of
                        the deserving poor would have been glad to add a little to their slender
                        incomes by putting up your grimy evergreens for you; but—”</p>
                    <p>“Don't apologize,” I said. “We understand perfectly. We've infected you at
                        last. It is nice to do things with one's hands, isn't it?”</p>
                    <p>“Not in the least. It is very tiresome and very fatiguing; but some one had
                        to do it, it seems, and I at least could not sit by and see your tenantry
                        ground down without a word of protest, or the holding out of a helping hand.
                        I hope there are many, many scones, and very, very buttery. We deserve some
                        reward.”</p>
                    <p>After tea the work was resumed, and the hall, stairs, and white parlor were
                        all hung with shining wreaths before dinner-time.</p>
                    <p>“Yolande <emph>can</emph> work,” said Chloe to me, in confidence. “It's odd
                        that her perverse abstention from really interesting things has not made her
                        clumsy.”</p>
                    <p>“As if a hand the shape of hers could ever be clumsy,” I said, “any more than
                        a hand like yours could ever grow coarse.”</p>
                    <pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7142-249"/>
                    <p>“It might have done,” she said, “if you and I had gone on doing all the
                        house-work. We ought to be very grateful to Yolande. She has practically
                        organized the whole of our future for us. We are settled, fixed,
                        planted—yes, that's it—we grow, ourselves, of course, but she has planted us
                        in the right soil, with exactly the right aspect. Now our dear little
                        characters can develop beautifully, and our hands keep pretty, and no
                        wrinkles come in our nice, smooth foreheads. You've been a little I don't
                        know what about Yolande. But you must own that what she undertakes she does
                        well.”</p>
                    <p>“Even to the red-branding of suspected fruit-thieves—yes.”</p>
                    <p>Yolande was spending Christmas at the Red House, and, it being Christmas Eve,
                        the tenant dined with us. We had a merry evening. We had lighted a huge fire
                        in the big, empty drawing-room where the piano was; Chloe played waltzes,
                        and Yolande danced with me and with the tenant. When the dancing was over
                        Chloe and I sat by the fire and the others went out to look at the stars
                        from the balcony.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, youth, youth!” I sighed.</p>
                    <p>“They will catch their deaths of cold,” said Chloe, prosaically.</p>
                    <p>I whispered: “Chloe, in a very short time<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7142-250"/>
                        those people will come through that French window with the announcement of
                        their engagement on their lips. This is the tamest love-affair I have ever
                        witnessed. Everything has gone far too smoothly. Yolande has fallen in love
                        obviously, bluntly, without any of those fine shades and nice feelings which
                        you will remember to have noted in other cases—our own, for instance. She
                        has grown rather dull.”</p>
                    <p>“Don't talk so loud,” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“As for him,” I went on, “happiness exudes from him like—like turpentine from
                        the pine-tree, or oil from the skin of the castor, or beaver.”</p>
                    <p>“I suppose when we're old we shall never talk nonsense,” she said. “I almost
                        think you're getting too old for it now. Castor, indeed!”</p>
                    <p>“No, I'm not. Yes, we shall. We shall never grow old, because we shall always
                        talk nonsense. Don't you think it would be nice and kind and thoughtful of
                        us to go up to the loafery and leave them this room? I know she'll have an
                        awful cold if she stays out there much longer. It's a terrible thing to
                        celebrate your betrothal by a cold in the head.”</p>
                    <p>So we spoke out into the starlit twilight of the balcony, and begged to be
                        excused, and then we crept up-stairs and raked together the red<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7142-251"/> embers of our loafery fire, and put logs on and
                        crouched happily in low chairs on the hearthrug of our very own fire. Chloe
                        knitted and I smoked happily and quietly till it seemed that we must no
                        longer delay to go down and speed our parting tenant. It was, in fact,
                        eleven o'clock. I was just knocking out my pipe on the hob when a light tap
                        on the door mingled with my own tapping, and Yolande's face looked round the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>“Come in!” we said, “come in!” But we wondered, because Yolande had never,
                        since the day when in our pride we first showed it to her, crossed the
                        threshold of that room. Now she came in and closed the door softly.</p>
                    <p>“He's gone,” she said. “He asked me to say good-night to you for him.”</p>
                    <p>She came across the room and sat down on the hearth-rug at Chloe's feet. She
                        leaned her arm on Chloe's knee and laid her face upon the arm.</p>
                    <p>“This is the room of all rooms for confidences,” she said, after a silence.
                        “That's why I thought I might come in just this once. I've got something to
                        tell you—”</p>
                    <p>Chloe and I successfully avoided each other's eyes.</p>
                    <p>Another silence.</p>
                    <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7142-252"/>
                    <p>“Shall I go away?” I said, clumsily.</p>
                    <p>“Don't be silly,” she said. “It's nothing so very important, after all. Only
                        I am afraid it will surprise you a little. I am rather surprised myself. As
                        a matter of fact, I had never been so surprised in my life. It was not at
                        all what I expected myself to do. What do you think I am going to be idiot
                        enough to do?”</p>
                    <p>We said, with as good an appearance of perfect ignorance as we could command,
                        that we were sure we did not know.</p>
                    <p>“I'm going to be married,” she said. “There!”</p>
                    <p>It was difficult to express congratulatory surprise—so difficult that we
                        failed utterly. Chloe threw her arms round Yolande's neck and began to laugh
                        softly.</p>
                    <p>“You dear, silly, clever, blind, darling mole,” she said. “Did you really
                        think we were quite blind too—Len and I, who love you? My dear, we've known
                        it from the very first, almost, and long before you did, I expect.”</p>
                    <p>“Known what?” said Yolande, in a suddenly changed voice; but she returned
                        Chloe's kisses.</p>
                    <p>“Why, everything, my pretty, clever, foolish child,” said Chloe. “We've been
                        watching over you and loving you all the time, like two old birds with a
                        young one who is just learning to fly.”</p>
                    <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7142-253"/>
                    <p>“Oh, you have, have you?” said Miss Riseborough, softly.</p>
                    <p>“Yolande, you don't mind our being glad, and saying so? It's all been so
                        beautifully simple and straightforward and idyllic; none of those horrible
                        romantic complications that one expects from a Girton girl's
                        love-affairs.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, it has, has it?” Yolande's voice was softer than ever. I felt in my
                        bones that for some reason Chloe's gentle enthusiasm did not please.</p>
                    <p>“I will go and put up the shutters,” I said, for I felt that I was out of
                        place in this confidence.</p>
                    <p>“No, don't,” said Yolande, with a curious stiffness in her voice. “Do you
                        really mean, Chloe, that you have been imagining that—”</p>
                    <p>“That the tenant worshipped the ground under your pretty feet?” said my wife.
                        “Well, yes.”</p>
                    <p>“You are strangely mistaken,” Yolande said, very deliberately. “I am going to
                        marry a man you have never seen.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>Yolande</emph>!”</p>
                    <p>“Then I must offer you more formal and less well-informed congratulations,”
                        said I. “What is his name?”</p>
                    <p>There was a slight pause.</p>

                    <p>“Percival Forbes,” she said.</p>
                    <p>Our tenant's name was something quite different. A silence followed that none
                        of us knew how to break. Chloe spoke first.</p>
                    <p>“My dear girl, how annoying you must have thought us. I am so sorry. I wish I
                        hadn't said—I don't know what it was I did say.”</p>
                    <p>“It's all right,” said Yolande, in an odd, stifled voice; “but really, if you
                        want romance—”</p>
                    <p>“Yolande, I don't understand you to-night.” Chloe was making horseshoes in
                        her forehead. “Tell us what you wish to tell us. I am afraid of you. I don't
                        like to ask you anything.”</p>
                    <p>“Why should you, when it's so beautifully tame and idyllic? But I'll tell you
                        a story if you like.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe stroked her hair timidly, and I, in sheer embarrassment, refilled my
                        pipe.</p>
                    <p>“Imagine a young woman, tolerably well educated and very cocksure about
                        everything. She meets a man, and they like each other. Then they quarrel—oh,
                        never mind what about—and the man goes to India, and she is very sorry. And
                        then he writes that he is coming back, and will she see him on Christmas
                        Day? And she says yes—and to-morrow is Christmas Day. And all this time
                        they've both been<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7142-255"/> perfectly miserable. Is
                        that more romantic—and involved?”</p>
                    <p>“Much,” said Chloe, with conviction.</p>
                    <p>“But I don't like it so well, Yolande,” I said, “because there is more to the
                        story. May I hit out straight from the shoulder?—as you said to Chloe once.
                        Do you remember?”</p>
                    <p>“Strike here,” she said, remembering, and with a smile that seemed to me
                        unmeaning she folded her hands over her heart.</p>
                    <p>“Well, then,” I said, “this is, as you say, the room for confidences. It is
                        the Palace of Truth.”</p>
                    <p>“Not quite,” said Yolande, still smiling.</p>
                    <p>“Well, it's jolly well going to be,” I said, in some irritation. “You must
                        own, dear and foolish lady, that our mistake was natural. You have walked
                        and talked, played chess, bicycled, gone to foot-ball matches, and
                        remodelled your whole nature to please the tenant, and now—”</p>
                    <p>“Remodelled my nature? How hateful! But I haven't.”</p>
                    <p>“He at least will not be satisfied to know that all this was merely done to
                        pass the time while you waited for your other lover—”</p>
                    <p>“This is hitting without the gloves,” said Yolande; “but go on. It amuses
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>“It oughtn't to,” I said; “it won't amuse<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7142-256"/>
                        him. I like the tenant, and I think you've behaved atrociously to him. Now,
                        forgive me for easing my mind, and let's never recur to the subject
                        again.”</p>
                    <p>“But,” said Yolande, in a small, meek voice, “he is engaged to another
                        girl—her name is Jane—and he happens to be <emph>his</emph> brother.”</p>
                    <p>“And even so,” I said, “if ever I saw true love in a man's eyes I've seen it
                        in his when he looked at you. Jane, indeed! And all your interest in
                        sport—the thing you used to hate most?”</p>
                    <p>Yolande was silent a moment. Then she said: “Len, I haven't been scolded like
                        this for years. I didn't know you cared enough about me to do it.”</p>
                    <p>“You don't know how much we do care,” said my wife, gently. “But, Len, what
                        is the use?”</p>
                    <p>“Suppose,” said Yolande, slowly, “one had quarrelled with the other one—the
                        one in India—because he would hunt and one thought it cruel. Don't you think
                        one might have tried to learn to like sport, for his sake?”</p>
                    <p>“I've said my say,” said I, “and I hope you've forgiven me. Our tenant may be
                        engaged to fifty girls, but it's you he loves—”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” she said, softly. “Yes.” Then she<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7142-257"/>
                        flashed a dazzling, illuminating smile at us and put her chin in the air in
                        the prettiest, proudest way. “Yes, I think it is.”</p>
                    <p>I think I may be pardoned for taking Yolande by the shoulders and shaking her
                        as she held out to Chloe's eyes a trembling left hand on which shone the
                        gold signet ring which I had noted a hundred times on our tenant's
                        finger.</p>
                    <p>“Then why did you say it was so flat and unromantic, and drive me to
                        inventing a romance for you? It was all your fault, Chloe. No, there isn't
                        any man in India. There isn't any man at all but the one—there never has
                        been. Now you're not to crow over me and say you told me so, for it's all
                        quite different from what you think. We shall start on a basis of mutual
                        esteem—no, you needn't laugh—and I will never sew a button on for him or
                        make him a pudding as long as I live. Good-night. Thank you for your
                        scolding, Len. I don't think I ever enjoyed anything so much in my
                        life.”</p>
                    <p>“I'll come and put you to bed,” said Chloe. “It's all Len's fault. If he
                        hadn't been here I should never have put your dear, foolish back up. But I
                        never thought you could have told such wicked stories. I <emph>am</emph>
                        blind, and stupid,<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7142-258"/> but I have wit enough
                        left to unhook your gown and brush your hair. Come!”</p>
                    <p>When they had gone I turned idly to the table. There lay an unfinished
                        drawing of my wife's—a child with an impossibly foreshortened arm carrying a
                        jug in two dimensions, on a head like a deformed cocoanut. I looked at it
                        for a little while and then set to work. The sketch was spirited, and I had
                        a certain pleasure in working it out, a pleasure so engrossing that I did
                        not hear the door open, and my heart leaped like a fish with a pike after it
                        as two hands fell on my shoulders, and I knew that my secret was
                        discovered—that henceforth not Yolande, not the ghost, but I myself must
                        carry the praise or blame due to the finisher of Chloe's pictures. I turned
                        my head and kissed the hand that lay on my left shoulder, the hand with my
                        wedding-ring on it. She ruffled my hair with the other hand, and, “Thank
                        you, dear,” she said, simply.</p>
                    <p>“For the kiss?”</p>
                    <p>“For that and everything—for all the trouble you've taken with my silly
                        drawings. I'm glad I caught you at it, you dear, industrious beaver. I've
                        wanted to tell you—oh, for such a long time!—how clever you are, and how
                        much better you draw than I do!”</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7142-259"/>
                    <p>“But you thought it was Yolande—you know you did,” I said, turning in my
                        chair so that my arm could go round her as she stood.</p>
                    <p>“I know you thought I did,” she said, “and I never could understand how you
                        could think me so silly. Why, Yolande couldn't begin to do the drawings
                        you've done! My silly boy, do you suppose I haven't got heaps and heaps of
                        your old drawings put away? Did you really think that I shouldn't know your
                        touch anywhere?”</p>
                    <p>“I did; I was a fool, dear. And you're a darling. But I ought to quarrel with
                        you. Good wives don't have secrets from their husbands, madam. Why did you
                        pretend you didn't know?”</p>
                    <p>“It wasn't <emph>my</emph> secret,” she said, blinking at me in surprise. “It
                        was <emph>your</emph> secret. And you were so fond of it, I couldn't bear to
                        take it from you. And I always thought you'd tell me some day. Wouldn't you
                        have? Why didn't you? I gave you lots of chances. Don't you remember—when I
                        asked what you wanted the India rubber for, and when I said it didn't matter
                        which of us did the work?”</p>
                    <p>“You said that about Yolande and the ghost and the writing,” I reminded
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“Did I? Well the principle's the same, isn't it? You see how good and kind I
                        am. I'm not<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7142-260"/> a bit angry with you for
                        keeping secrets from me. If I'd kept a secret like that from you you'd have
                        been frightfully cross, wouldn't you?”</p>
                    <p>“Ferocious. But then you couldn't,” I said, confidently. “And you really like
                        the drawings?”</p>
                    <p>“You know,” she said; “and I'm so awfully pleased to see how clever you are.
                        Len, I <emph>like</emph> you to be able to do some things better than
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>“I think I could talk better grammar,” I said, “if I tried very hard indeed,
                        with both hands and all my might.”</p>
                    <p>“It was very nice and funny to see you nursing your dear little-big secret,
                        and all the time it was mine, too.”</p>
                    <p>“Madam,” I said, “you have deceived and betrayed me. I will go and put up the
                        shutters and forget my wrongs in sleep. Oh, by-the-way—Yolande?”</p>
                    <p>We had both forgotten her.</p>
                    <p>“She is very happy. I must have talked like a tract or an aunt to have driven
                        her to such extremes. But it <emph>is</emph> all exactly as I said,
                        perfectly simple and idyllic, and the happiest thing in the
                        world—almost—”</p>
                    <p>“Almost,” said I. “And when are they to be married?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, almost directly. There's nothing to<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7142-261"/>
                        wait for. They are going to take on the other cottage and run a covered way
                        across the garden, and have their kitchen and dining-room and her study
                        there and his study and their sitting-room in the other one. They've
                        arranged it all in the most delightfully practical and prosaic way. And
                        she'll want her furniture. They are to have separate studies, and always
                        knock at each other's study doors, and neither is to be offended if the
                        other says: ‘You can't come in. I don't want you!’”</p>
                    <p>I laughed. “And the pupils?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, that's all over. She won't have any more pupils. She's going to write a
                        book on the Higher Education of Women.”</p>
                    <p>“And she wants her furniture? Well, we have the furniture that was in the
                        cellar, and we can go about, by-and-by, and pick up beautiful odd things
                        here and there. We can afford to now.”</p>
                    <p>“I wish you'd tell me one thing, Len,” said my wife.</p>
                    <p>“Well?”</p>
                    <p>“Do you really like writing or drawing best?”</p>
                    <p>“We make a good bit of money by both,” I said. “I think we must give Yolande
                        a very, very beautiful wedding-present—with our best love—and the
                        ghost's!”</p>
                    <pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7142-262"/>
                    <p>She frowned a little.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, but quite apart from the money, which do you like doing best? Do tell
                        me. Tell me straight out!”</p>
                    <p>“Well, then,” I said, “I've got rather fond of drawing; I suppose because
                        it's not my work, but yours. As Yolande says, we are incurably prone to do
                        anything rather than our own proper work.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” she said, “we are. Go and put up the shutters now, Len, and don't be
                        hours about it, or I shall fancy you have met a burglar.”</p>
                    <p>“My father met a burglar once,” I said. “He heard a row and went down, and
                        when he didn't come back my mother thought he might have been overpowered,
                        so she took the bedroom poker and went down to his assistance.”</p>
                    <p>“I should have gone with him,” said Chloe. “Well?”</p>
                    <p>“Well, she went down very softly, and there was a light in the kitchen, and
                        there was the burglar in the arm-chair, telling a piteous tale, and my
                        father making cocoa for him over the spirit-lamp!”</p>
                    <p>“He was a darling,” said Chloe, “and so are you; but we're out of cocoa. You
                        must give the burglar bottled beer instead. I'll stay here till you come
                        back.”</p>
                    <pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7142-263"/>
                    <p>When I came back she was sitting in her favorite little rocking-chair.</p>
                    <p>“Come and sit down a little longer,” she said.</p>
                    <p>“It's very late,” said I, lowering myself to the hearth-rug at her feet.</p>
                    <p>“Yes; it's Christmas Day, I know, Len. We were talking about secrets just
                        now, and you said I could never keep one from you. Would you be very angry
                        if I did?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not advise you to try,” I said, taking her hands in mine. They were
                        cold, and they trembled a little.</p>
                    <p>“But suppose I have? Will you be very angry?”</p>
                    <p>“Tell me, and try.”</p>
                    <p>“It's absurd,” she said, trying to laugh. “I always thought it would be so
                        easy to tell you, and now it is so difficult. You must tell me things
                        first—silly things—to give me courage.”</p>
                    <p>I told her several. Then we sat silent. Presently I said: “My pussy-kitten,
                        have you really something serious to tell me? Or is it only that you are
                        upset over this business of Yolande? Don't worry over trifles, dearest and
                        best, but if there is really anything you want to tell me, tell me now. It
                        can't be anything that it would hurt me to hear.”</p>
                    <p>“I'm not at all sure about that.” She spoke<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7142-264"/>
                        with a gleam of soft mischief in her eyes. “You're very kind and trusting,
                        Len, but—oh—seriously, I believe you'll hate me when I tell you.”</p>
                    <p>“Then tell me at once,” I said. “Don't tantalize me with this promise of a
                        wholly new sensation.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, if you will make fun—”</p>
                    <p>“I'm not, but I won't have you make mountains out of mole-hills. Come, show
                        me the mole-hill and we'll trample it together. Why, silly Chloe, your hands
                        are like ice, and how they tremble! Out with it—”</p>
                    <p>“I don't think I'll tell you at all,” she said. “You ought to be clever
                        enough to find out. Besides, you kept a secret from me, Len, and I wasn't
                        angry.”</p>
                    <p>Even then I didn't see.</p>
                    <p>She rose suddenly. “No, I won't tell you tonight,” she said. “You don't
                        really want to hear it.”</p>
                    <p>I rose, too. “You will tell me to-night,” I said, holding her hands. “My
                        dear, how can you tease me so?”</p>
                    <p>She put her arms round my neck and whispered in my ear.</p>
                    <p>“And oh,” she cried, “don't be cross! I can't bear it if you are.”</p>
                    <p>“Cross! My dear, delightful, clever, wonderful<pb xml:id="VAB7142-265"/>
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7142-266"/> derful genius of a pussy-kitten! If you
                        only knew how I've worried and wondered. And it was you all the time—you,
                        you, you! Oh, what a fool I've been! But I've been punished for my folly.
                        Chloe, I've come very near to hating Yolande, and all the time it was
                        you—not Yolande or the ghost, but <emph>you</emph>, who were writing all
                        those wonderful endings to my silly stories! Sit down on your throne and let
                        me do you homage.” I put her back in the rocking-chair and knelt before
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“I meant to tell you at first,” she said, “but when you thought it was
                        Yolande, I thought it was so funny and stupid of you, because she doesn't
                        really see half the things I put in the stories.”</p>
                    <p>“Funny and stupid, indeed,” I echoed. “You were wiser. You <emph>do</emph>
                        see things. And tell me, Chloe, which do you like doing best—writing or
                        drawing?”</p>
                    <p>“Why, writing, of course!” she said, “because it's not <emph>my</emph> work,
                        but <emph>yours</emph>. Yolande was quite right.”</p>
                    <p>“Then for the future you must put your name to the stories.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, must I?” she asked, wistfully. “I thought it would be so nice if we put
                        both our names. And to the drawings, too. Because<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7142-267"/> you do invent plots better than I do, and I can
                        do sketches. Then it would all be <emph>our</emph> work—not just yours or
                        mine, but ours.”</p>
                    <p>“Very well,” I said; “better than well! Ours be it. As you've said once, or
                        more than once, it doesn't matter a straw which of us does the work, as long
                        as it <emph>is</emph> us, and not Yolande or the ghost.”</p>
                    <p>“What about grammar now? And trying with both hands? Len, it's Christmas Day
                        by the clock. I've got a present for you. It's a booken with pretty, pretty
                        pikkies, but I sha'n't give it to you till it's real, live, wide-awake
                        Christmas Day.”</p>
                    <p>“You've given me a most lovely present,” I said, “a beautiful brand-new
                        secret of your very own. To think that my wife's an author—an author of
                        genius! I never thought to see the day.”</p>
                    <p>“Don't peacock!” she said. “You've nothing to be so proud about. I'm as well
                        off as you are. My husband's an artist—an artist of genius! But I knew all
                        the time, didn't I, and you didn't, so I must be much cleverer than you,
                        really.”</p>
                    <p>“Isn't that what I've been saying? Twenty times cleverer and a thousand times
                        as dear.”</p>
                    <p>“I never could do sums,” she said, “but I<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7142-268"/>
                        did manage to put two and two together about the drawings, and the answer
                        was, ‘You!’”</p>
                    <p>“One and one is a better sum,” I said, “and easier, and the answer is,
                        ‘Us.’”</p>
                    <p>“And what about grammar now?” said she.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE PUSSY-KITTEN</head>
                    <p><hi>YOLANDE</hi> was married—she was married at Elmhurst church, Chloe and I
                        her only supporters. And after the wedding we all walked quietly down
                        together from the church and said “Good-bye” to them at the door of their
                        cottage, through whose windows the welcoming firelight shone out into the
                        cheerless January dusk.</p>
                    <p>“What an ideal beginning to a honey-moon!” said my wife. “Fancy walking
                        straight home to your own house. No broughams and slippers and things, no
                        long railway journey and horrid hotels and lodgings, with the rice dropping
                        out of you in showers every time you move an inch, and everybody grinning
                        sympathetically after you. It's like Frances's wedding in the
                            <title>Professor</title>.”</p>
                    <p>“It's a warmer wedding than that,” said I, “That description always chills me
                        to the bone,<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7142-270"/> And does it matter so much
                        where you go, as long as you go together? I seem to remember a hideous
                        parlor at Pevensey that once contented two moderately happy people.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” she said, “but this is best. Who knows how much happier we should have
                        been if we'd gone straight home to the Bandbox?”</p>
                    <p>“We should never have been able to leave it,” said I. “It's better as it is.
                        Suppose I had been wise and firm and inflexible—”</p>
                    <p>“A youthful Murdstone—”</p>
                    <p>“And refused to yield to your superior wisdom and obstinacy, and—”</p>
                    <p>“And we had never come to the Red House! Yes, it's all my doing, Len—the only
                        thing I'm really and truly proud of. It's Yolande's doing, partly, but it's
                        mine, too. Our lines have fallen unto us in pleasant places. Come in. I feel
                        as if it was us who had just been married and were going home to our own
                        house. It's odd—I always feel that we've only just been married, and yet
                        that we've been married ever since we can remember.”</p>
                    <p>“So we have,” said I.</p>
                    <p>“We are very fortunate,” she said, “and I am very, very grateful.”</p>
                    <p>We were, indeed, fortunate. Chloe's daring adoption of the Red House as our
                        home had<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7142-271"/> been generously repaid. Instead
                        of being the white elephant as which it had sometimes sought to disguise
                        itself, it was now a credit to us, and an unchanging joy. Our cottages were
                        let, and our garden. Our work in the Red House had been prosperous, the
                        memories that had grown up there were precious, the hopes more precious
                        still. Mary was happier than ever, now that she had a small servant—her
                        slender <corr>personality</corr> wholly justified by our prosperity and our
                        future—to teach and order about and be kind to. Our lives were peaceful,
                        ordered, incredibly pleasant. And if I still sometimes cleaned a candlestick
                        or a sword, and Chloe now and then washed china or dusted the white parlor,
                        not even Yolande could complain that we neglected our work to indulge in
                        these recreations.</p>
                    <p>Chloe remarked one day that we had grown uninteresting. Our earlier domestic
                        adventures, she declared, might have been made really amusing by a competent
                        narrator, but now nothing happened to us except the things that ought to
                        happen.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, wait,” I said, “my regretful optimist; things will go on happening to us
                        all our lives long. This is only an ‘easy.’ We are in a peaceful backwater
                        just now. We shall be pulling against the stream again soon enough.”</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7142-272"/>
                    <p>“But we <emph>are</emph> uninteresting,” she persisted.</p>
                    <p>“It's not polite of you to say so. Even the plural pronoun doesn't redeem
                        that speech. <emph>I</emph> don't find <emph>you</emph> uninteresting—at
                        least, not very.”</p>
                    <p>“It's all quite dull and flat,” she went on, scorning to take up the
                        gauntlet; “and the worst of it is, it is so beautiful when things are flat
                        and dull. I hardly dare to draw my breath for fear something should happen.
                        Things that happen are always horrid. It's the times when nothing happens
                        that are too good for one to dare to be quite happy in them.”</p>
                    <p>“Nice things do happen sometimes,” I said, softly. “Besides, we have the
                        interest of watching Yolande just now. She won't elude our vigilance
                        forever; sooner or later she'll justify your prediction and be discovered
                        darning the tenant's socks.”</p>
                    <p>“Even that won't be a very wonderful happening,” said my wife; “though so
                        far, I confess, she has lived up to her ideals most nobly. He supports her
                        in her resolution to keep her fingers clean of house-work, and the ferret's
                        wife does all her sewing. It's <emph>us</emph> that things don't happen to
                        any more. And, oh, Len, I don't want anything to happen. Don't you notice
                        that we hardly ever even quarrel now?”</p>
                    <p>“Did we ever—much?”</p>
                    <pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7142-273"/>
                    <p>“We used to be snarky sometimes—much snarkier than we are now. Why is it? Is
                        it because we have more money? People are always supposed to quarrel when
                        they are poor.”</p>
                    <p>“We were never poor enough to throw the teacups at each other's heads,” I
                        said, “even in our worst days. Look at that little gold ball.”</p>
                    <p>“It's winter aconite,” she informed me. “It has a prettier name, but I've
                        forgotten it. It's very late. I suppose it overslept itself; the others are
                        over long ago.”</p>
                    <p>We were walking slowly round the garden, where the crocuses showed green and
                        gold, and the birds were singing like mad. The spikes and buds of the
                        daffodils made green patches, and the blue squills were out. The pigeons on
                        the farm-roof were preening their shining breasts, nestling up to each
                        other, repeating unceasingly the pretty, monotonous, proud cry of their
                        pairing-time.</p>
                    <p>“You can hear quite well what they're saying,” said Chloe. “Listen: ‘Look at
                        us two! Look at us two!’ They are absurdly happy.”</p>
                    <p>“So they ought to be,” I said; “it's a happy day. There's no doubt at all now
                        that spring will come again. I've only half believed it all these winter
                        months. How neat that market-gardener man has made everything! I do hope<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7142-274"/> we sha'n't loathe it in the summer when
                        we walk in it and remember how sweet and untidy and all-over-the-place it
                        was last year. <emph>That</emph> would be a happening, indeed.”</p>
                    <p>“If we are both alive and in this garden together in the summer we sha'n't
                        hate anything much, shall we? Very well, I won't, if you hate it so, but
                        it's silly not to face things. People do die sometimes, you know, even
                        people who love each other.”</p>
                    <p>“I won't have it,” I said, firmly. “Dearest and silliest, you must not
                        scratch my heart with those kitty claws of yours, or I shall be sorry I ever
                        let you have it to play with. I'd rather quarrel with you. As you say, we've
                        neglected that pastime shockingly. Let us begin. Come, think of something to
                        quarrel about, and you shall see what reserve forces of crude
                        disagreeableness I have been getting ready all these dear months. Ah, don't,
                        don't! You know it always makes you ill to cry.”</p>
                    <p>For she was clinging to me and hiding her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Don't,” I heard her say. “I don't want to claw you. It claws me just as
                        much. You don't know how silly I am. I can't bear to let you out of my
                        sight, because, perhaps, I sha'n't be able to be with you very much longer.
                            Len<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7142-275"/> dear, we know each other so well;
                        we've been such friends, too, haven't we? We've been so happy. It makes me
                        frightened. And now it's so peaceful; I feel as if things were gathering
                        together for some awful thing to happen. You don't know!”</p>
                    <p>I was silent. Did I not know?</p>
                    <p>“Yes, you do,” she went on, holding me more closely. “You do, you do, but you
                        pretend you aren't afraid of anything, because you think it makes me
                        cheerful. It doesn't. I hate to think that we're pretending to each
                        other—now. So I tell you plainly, Len, I'm very, very frightened, and you
                        know it, and so are you, and I know that, and if you'd only let me look
                        straight at it, perhaps I shouldn't be so frightened. Oh, there are so many
                        things I want to say to you. There, I won't any more. Let me take your arm,
                        and we'll walk quietly and respectably like good children, and you must let
                        me say anything I like, and you mustn't try not to say everything that comes
                        into your head, and you're not to try to cheer me up, because I can't bear
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>So we walked and talked. And, indeed, such talk, while it intensified my own
                        aching passion of tenderness and solicitude, did, by its frank revelation of
                        that passion, do more to calm and cheer my wife than all my brave
                            pretence<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7142-276"/> —it was brave—of confident
                        fearlessness had ever done. But I have written already more than is needed.
                        It is because, when I remember that time, I cannot well command my thought;
                        and my pen, seeing its superior officer in mutiny, mutinies too. For it was
                        March now, and the time of our great fear and our great happiness was very
                        near.</p>
                    <p>Strangely enough, after that day it was Chloe who made the brave pretences
                        and I who clung to her, imploring her to teach me her courage and
                        confidence. Once again in the history of the Red House my wife and I had
                        changed parts.</p>
                    <p>The hushed peace that brooded over us folded us in wings too soft and close
                        to let any breath of outside tempest come near. Yolande and the tenant
                        talked to us, as it were, through a soft, warm veil. Our relations—oh,
                        fortunate destiny that was ours!—kept away. Chloe's mother (who is as nice
                        as any one could be who is not Chloe, and is twice Chloe's age) sprained an
                        opportune ankle and could not come to us as she had intended, and as I had
                        thought I wished. So that my wife and I had these last days—the last, as we
                        alternately prayed and feared—alone together. The doings of Yolande and
                        Yolande's husband were like a bright, gay<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7142-277"/>
                        embroidery on the rich fabric of our quiet happiness. And the time drew
                        near.</p>
                    <p>It was on the 1st of April—a too appropriate date, as Yolande afterwards
                        bewailed—that Chloe suddenly realized, in an imperative shock, that there
                        was a certain Japanese dressing-jacket pattern without which she could not
                        be happy another moment. She had the stuff to make it, a demurely eccentric
                        Eastern-patterned silk; she also had the material—a dull, soft blue—for what
                        she called the <foreign xml:lang="fre">revers</foreign>. I suppose a man
                        would call it the lining, but I am not quite sure.</p>
                    <p>So she left a half-written story of the very strongest possible “domestic
                        interest” (it was, indeed, for she was to get twenty pounds for the finished
                        article) to go down to Yolande's cottage and borrow this priceless pattern
                        which Yolande was known to possess. She had bought it among others for the
                        guidance of the dressmaker who prepared her trousseau. And I, almost without
                        a pang, abandoned a nearly finished drawing to go with her.</p>
                    <p>The buds were gray and green on the trees, on the lilacs the buds were
                        bronze, and carmine on the creeper. The daffodils were out, and the tulips
                        rigid with the energy of pride and<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7142-278"/>
                        promise. Everything that makes the glory of the summer garden was pushing up
                        green leaves and crying: “I am coming, I am coming—only be patient! And
                        don't disturb me, for I am very busy making flowers for you. Wait, and you
                        shall see!” The birds' song was almost as intense as in the first
                        pairing-time. We walked up the neat cottage garden, and we remembered the
                        days of Prosser and the rags and the dead mouse and the mutton-bone. Now the
                        garden was all trim and neat, and the earth had stirred in her sleep and
                        thrown out handfuls of primroses and violets and early red tulips, just to
                        show what she could do, and to remind us what she would do for us when the
                        sun, her lover, had kissed her fully awake.</p>
                    <p>We knocked at the cottage door. It was a very nice knocker—old brass.
                        Yolande—under my guidance—had picked it up for sevenpence at a
                        rag-and-bottle shop in Deptford. There was a long pause. Usually the door
                        was opened almost coincidently with the fall of the knocker by pretty,
                        fair-haired, cheery-faced Mrs. Bates, but now we stood long on the narrow
                        doorstep and heard from within sounds of scuffling and rustling. We had time
                        to see how right Browning was when he said, “The leaf-buds on the vine are
                        woolly,” and how very<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7142-279"/> long before their
                        white perfection come the green pledges of the annunciation lilies.</p>
                    <p>We knocked again. The scuffle or rustle assured us that some one was within.
                        The leisure of our next waiting showed us the auriculas—“honey-flowers” our
                        grandmothers used to call them; “dusty millers” the country-folk call them
                        still—glowing in their soft shades of primrose and orange and red and
                        purple.</p>
                    <p>But when one desires, with all one's soul, the cut-out paper pattern of a
                        Japanese dressing-jacket for which one has already the material, even
                        auriculas cannot charm away desire for long.</p>
                    <p>This time it was Chloe who knocked; she knocked vehemently, and almost on the
                        instant the door was opened by our tenant in person—our tenant, resplendent
                        in speckless frock-coat and gleaming high hat—the armor in which he
                        habitually leaves his home to fight with beasts in the newspaper-offices of
                        Fleet Street.</p>
                    <p>“I'm rushing for my train,” he said, hurriedly, and, indeed, its smoke showed
                        already beyond the gray veil of leaf-buds on the trees of our railway
                        embankment. “I'm glad you've come. I wanted to send for you yesterday, but
                        Yolande wouldn't—”</p>
                    <p>“Whatever is the matter?”</p>
                    <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7142-280"/>
                    <p>“Oh, nothing—a domestic crisis. Yolande's coping with it. She loathes a
                        crisis in little, but she's coping with it with the detail of a dictionary
                        and the generalship of a—of a general. I've no time to turn the phrase.” He
                        tore off down the red path, shouting as he went, “I say, Yo, I'll bring home
                        something cold for dinner.”</p>
                    <p>We were left planted on the doorstep. The next moment Yolande came down the
                        stairs—they lead, <foreign xml:lang="fre">sans phrases</foreign>, from the
                        bedrooms into the dining-room—and stood before us, a changed, a transfigured
                        Yolande. Her stuff dress of dull Venetian red was pinned up over a delicious
                        petticoat of mauve silk and lace; she wore an apron—one of Mrs. Bates's, I
                        knew at once by its tasteful Nottingham trimmings—and over her bright hair
                        she had pinned a white silk handkerchief that conscientiously strove to look
                        like a mob-cap.</p>
                    <p>“Pray come in,” she said, in a bitter travesty of hospitality. “Come in and
                        gloat over my sorrows. Come in and tell me how you always told me so. ‘This
                        is the most unkindest cut of all’—‘Earl Percy sees my fall’—”</p>
                    <p>“This madness of quotations,” I said—</p>
                    <p>“I'd rather be a dog and bay the morn,” she went on, pretending to tear her
                        pretty hair, “than—than what I am.”</p>
                    <pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7142-281"/>
                    <p>“And what are you?” asked Chloe, sitting down on the settle.</p>
                    <p>“I'm a house-maid,” she said, tragically—“a house-maid, and a parlor-maid,
                        and a cook, and a boy in buttons, and a butler, and a footman, and a person
                        who mends socks and sews on buttons. The ferret's wife's sister's husband is
                        ill, and the ferret's wife has gone to nurse her—”</p>
                    <p>“Without asking you?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course she <emph>asked</emph> me. And what could I say? Of course I said
                        I could manage perfectly. And now I <emph>am</emph> managing perfectly. It's
                        been going on since yesterday morning. Have some bottled beer? ‘It's not
                        what you want, but what you need, Brother Humphrey!’”</p>
                    <p>With this last quotation she sat down and poured out foaming beer for herself
                        and us—at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning!</p>
                    <p>We drank it in respectful silence.</p>
                    <p>“We've been up since the middle of the night,” she went on, setting down her
                        empty tumbler. “We're both involved in one common ruin. <emph>He</emph> lit
                        the fires; I got the breakfast. Then he found he had no socks mended,
                        and—and there were buttons. Chloe, Chloe! I darned his socks, but I did not
                        sew on his buttons. <emph>He</emph> did that. I think he'll get shirts with
                        studs for the future.<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7142-282"/> The needle broke and
                        the end went into his finger. Fortunately, I'd attended classes on—what do
                        you call it?—‘first injuries to the aided,’ or something—so I was able to
                        bandage his wounds; but it all took time, and he's two trains late already.
                        I am prostrate—a worm at your intruding feet, for you've no business to come
                        here in the morning and see my disgrace. But since you <emph>are</emph>
                        here, I'll confess. I almost wish I had learned to do things like this
                        before.”</p>
                    <p>“Confess a little more, my darling housemaid, page, and cook,” said Chloe,
                        “and then I'll help you to wash up.” For the breakfast things still covered
                        the table.</p>
                    <p>“What am I to confess?” asked Yolande. Her eyes were bright, and in her
                        cheeks shone the prettiest shell-pink.</p>
                    <p>“Confess that you <emph>like</emph> doing house-work and making breakfast and
                        darning socks in your own house and for your own man.”</p>
                    <p>“I hate it,” said Yolande, firmly, but her eyes betrayed her; “but even if I
                        liked it, it doesn't effect what I used to say to you. I used to tell you
                        that you ought not to neglect your proper work for orgies of dish-washing
                        and knife-cleaning or wild revels of wood-chopping. And no more you ought.
                        But if I choose to do it, I may. If I choose to concentrate myself on it, I
                        can do<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7142-283"/> it as well as you can. And in a
                        crisis—it <emph>is</emph> my work. So my conscience is at peace.”</p>
                    <p>“And the higher education of women!” said Chloe.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, bother the higher education of women!” said Yolande. “Let's wash
                        up.”</p>
                    <p>We helped in the house-work; it was to us a holiday excursion—a treat to good
                        children. Incidentally, in the course of it we observed several things. One,
                        that the two studies were now in one house, and that the door between them
                        had been taken off its hinges and replaced by an Indian curtain drawn back
                        in folds too stiff and formal to allow one to suppose for an instant that it
                        was ever drawn across the doorway. Two, that Yolande had a work-basket, and
                        that from it peeped a half-hemmed man's necktie, and a half-knitted man's
                        sock. Third— But why sing songs of triumph over the vanquished? Yolande had
                        found her happiness where we had found it, so let my last words of her leave
                        her there.</p>
                    <p>And now, if I might, I would leave here certain blank pages to speak for me
                        of certain April days, not ever to be forgotten, and never, never, never to
                        be written about.</p>
                    <p>I always look with wonder alternating with<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7142-284"/>
                        envy on those men who can set down, in black and white, the heights of their
                        joy, the depths of their trouble. And I marvel whether they have less
                        imagination than I, or more. Chloe can do this thing—and in a woman one can
                        only envy the faculty; it is that which makes her a better story-teller than
                        I.</p>
                    <p>For my part, when I think of those days my lips are closed like the lips of
                        the dead, and my pen falls from between my fingers. So, because, somehow,
                        those days should be recorded, I long for the blank pages, on which every
                        man who loves his wife should read for himself what his heart would write
                        for him there.</p>
                    <p>And now it was May, and the sweet-plumed lilac was out, the red and white
                        hawthorns were in bud-round, shining beads of coral and pearl. The garden
                        had forgotten the lean days of winter and was all curves and softnesses in
                        its new green gown; fat thrushes hopped and pecked on the wide, wet lawns.
                        The yellow tulips stood up like tall lamps above the delicate brocade of the
                        forget-me-nots and their leaves. It was mid-May, and this was the morning
                        which Chloe has chosen, since it is Saturday and a whole holiday, to invite
                        the whole tribe of those astonishing Bastable children to spend the day.</p>
                    <pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7142-285"/>
                    <p>They arrived, much neater than I had expected, and when Chloe had greeted
                        them—she remembered all their names, down to H.O.—she said:</p>
                    <p>“I've something new to show you—something new and nice. Come up-stairs and
                        let's look at it.”</p>
                    <p>Chloe always would go up the stairs two steps at a time when anything she
                        wanted was at the top of them. The children now, light-footed, heavy-booted,
                        followed, clattering, her flying Turkish-slippered feet and the flutter of
                        her spring-green gown.</p>
                    <p>She led them to our loafery—now transformed in many undreamed-of ways, but
                        with its window-bars still screened with budding creeper.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remember this?” she asked, pointing to a brown object by the
                        fireside.</p>
                    <p>“Rather,” said the boy they call Oswald. “It's one of the things we found in
                        your secret cellar that day. We all thought what a good rabbit-hutch it
                        would make.”</p>
                    <p>The girls had made a rush forward, with the prettiest “Oh!” of wonder and
                        delight.</p>
                    <p>The smallest boy of all put his fat legs very far apart. “Why,” said he, in a
                        tone of positive injury, “you've been and gone and put a <emph>baby</emph>
                        in it!”</p>

                    <p>“Don't you think a baby's rather a good thing to put in a cradle?” I said,
                        meekly.</p>
                    <p>“It would have made a jolly good hutch,” he said, with undisguised
                        regret.</p>
                    <p>The girls were gloating over the cradle in the most charming feminine
                        attitudes. I should have liked to draw them.</p>
                    <p>“The dear! the precious!” they said, in chorus. “What color are its eyes? Is
                        it a boy or a girl? What's its name?”</p>
                    <p>“Its eyes are blue—at present,” I said, “and it is a girl. And we call it the
                        Pussy-Kitten.”</p>
                    <p>“I should have thought you would have called it after some one with a real
                        name—an aunt or something,” said Oswald, rather gloomily.</p>
                    <p>“So I did. I called it after the dearest and best and prettiest lady in the
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>I could not help a glance at Chloe; she certainly did grow prettier every
                        day, and as for dearer—well, all things wax or wane.</p>
                    <p>The second boy, Dickie, surprised my glance. “Oh,” he said, with obvious
                        cessation of interest, “you mean <emph>her</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>He indicated Chloe by a not discourteous gesture, and instantly asked if they
                        might not go and see the pig. (Have I mentioned that Jim kept a pig?)</p>
                    <p>Permission given, they swept away like a tidal<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7142-288"/> wave, and we heard their boots sound fainter and
                        fainter on the stairs.</p>
                    <p>Chloe and I were left alone with the cradle.</p>
                    <p>“It is hard, isn't it,” I said, meeting her eyes across the cradle, “to lose
                        one's high estate—even when one mounts from it to a higher?”</p>
                    <p>“Is it?” she said, covering up a fat, pink fist thrust out from beneath the
                        pink eider-down.</p>
                    <p>“To have been a princess and then to be merely a queen! To have been a
                        pussy-kitten and to have given up that title to another, and such a very,
                        very small usurper, too!”</p>
                    <p>“She's not so very small, Len,” said my wife, anxiously.</p>
                    <p>“It sounds like a riddle,” I went on. “Would you rather be—a pussy-kitten or
                        a pussy-cat? Do you know the answer?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes,” she said, softly, “I know the answer; I know the answer very well,
                        indeed. And you—aren't you proud to have such a collection of pussies—a
                        pussy-cat and a pussy-kitten?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” I said, and across the cradle we kissed each other for the last time
                        in this story. “You know just how happy and how proud I am, my little mother
                        pussy-cat.”</p>
